I received an email about 2 weeks after I submitted my resume that they would like to consider me for the position and asked that I take an assessment test. This is a pretty standard test that is used by many companies to help determine if the prospective employee fits the position. After I completed the test, I received an interview with HR. It was about 2 1/2 hours long. Interview questions were directed at determining if I actually new the business and my attitude toward customer service. Very pleasant interview. The interviewer knew the business also and didn't just read questions off of a sheet. I was told that he would like to move on to the next step and scheduled an interview with the general manager of the store. During this 2 1/2 hour interview, I was walked around the store, greeted a couple tables with the manager, talked with other managers and discussed my past employers and future expectations. At this point I was told that they were going to order the background check. I received another email that I was to meet with another person in HR for my final interview. During this interview, we discussed points in the restaurant that needed attention, and was asked how I would handle different situations. All in all I really appreciated the amount of time that they spend picking their employees. If you become part of this family, you know that your co-workers will also be qualified. Very pleasant experience during the whole process.
