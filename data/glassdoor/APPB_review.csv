However, that being said it's been one of my favorite companies to work for.","Better attention to detail could be taken into training as most of the time the managers themselves don't directly work with the new hires, they work under an experienced employee of that station. However, because of this they often times have a new trainer each day and not everyone is on the same page with what is company procedure. I think they would benefit from having an actual trainer position that is used on a regular basis."

Very disrespectful treatment of a great man and mentor.,"I would say try to emulate the top companies to work for. Find out what's going on a microscale in your restaurant instead of having your district manager speak super technically and above the problem. Start getting down in the trenches and find out what's really going on. Don't keep general managers around that refused to hire extra staff when they have plenty of applications. Not having enough staff means the guest experience goes to the pits and your reputation is ruined. Try to run things in a way that makes your employees and managers think you respect their work, instead of running it like its only for profit. There is a lot of talk about taking care of people and how your numbers will follow but it is not what I have seen in person. This is why I believe the Austin area is so low on managers people are jumping off this ship at a high rate. I think you should not immediately take the guests words when they complain to corporate. I have seen many times when people lie to try to get extra money or extra things for free. It seems like if the customer has a bad reputation in a town for behaving badly you wouldn't give them precedence. If several people are telling you the same thing you may consider it.

They constantly change their products and add menu items to the point that even management has troubling remembering ingredients. The pos systems are running windows 2000 and constantly go down. They require that new employees go through two weeks of training. However, they are unwilling to pay an employee to do the training so the processes ends being a new employee on their own station while current employees from the other stations bark out instructions to them. If you fall behind and your ticket times go over the magical number they set, management will harass you from the other side of the line. They do not offer vacation, insurance, personal days, or benefits of any kind. You will have to work holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas eve. They do not allow gratuity or compensation for table complaints or unpaid checks. Employees are expected to show up regardless of weather conditions and are expected to stay open without considering the safety of their employees. Health codes prevent sick people from handling food but if you have a cold and call out they expect you to bring a note from a doctor. Did I mention they do not offer health insurance? Upper management set goals that are mathematically unreachable and expect store employees to explain why the store is down in sales. For example, they charge over three dollars for their soft drinks and when customers get water, they blame the servers for not up-selling beverages.They are terribly understaffed and have a very high turnover.","As a cookie cutter restaurant, you can differentiate your products in ways other than offering 85 mediocre menu items that slightly differ from the 85 menu items offered by the other cookie cutters restaurants.

However, they also think that they are entitled to write employees up, instate new store policies, and treat employees as though they are beneath them. Again, you are glorified card holders, that is all.<br><br>Next, we have the salaried managers. There's a spastic, disrespectful General manager whose newly coveted position has all wondering what he will be able to do for this store...if anything...there's the Kitchen Manager who's frequent trips away from the store always lead him to return to the store with what can only be assumed to be a vodka-induced buzz, and the Front of House Manager might possibly have the lowest IQ known to man.

Overall casual dress code and discounted meals.","Just another restaurant trained to micromanage the life out of their staff. Mostly management sits at expo and screams at their understaffed front of the house to run food. They actually have enough staff to have food runners and one server for every four tables but they make cuts to save money even if their service takes a huge hit and then they wonder why they have difficult lunches and dinners. There is a very small chance that you will be treated with respect unless you are close on a personal level with managers. They have VERY high expectations and instead of thinking ""What can I do as a manager to make it easier on my staff?"" many, many new servers will be taken to the back to get reprimanded and talked down to, and then expected to serve the rest of the night with a smile on their face.<br><br>The atmosphere is so casual and shows such obvious favoritism to senior servers that the conversations border on inappropriate often, and many servers were spoken of in a harassing manner by both management and servers when their backs were turned.<br><br>Theft was very common, and server books and money from the register would turn up missing constantly and there never seemed to be anything that upper management did to make the staff feel safe. The attitude was to hide your personal belongings and be careful rather than to assume the company would assist you in any way with this issue.<br><br>After 10pm during the week, management cuts the back of the house down to two people and the servers are expected to space out their orders by five + minutes before ringing them in. Even with four tables in the restaurant the ticket times were always at 20 minutes because management wanted to save $$ and cut the BOH, resulting in poor service and unsatisfied customers.<br><br>Customers are not there to appreciate your service. It's basically one notch above fast food for them, even if you are doing the same job that a server at a nicer casual restaurant would do. The tips are usually terrible, and you will have some of the most difficult tables in the industry coupled with hoards of teenagers and families with babies that leave a mess that spans half the dining room.<br><br> In my time at Applebee's, I didn't see one day go by without at least one server getting talked down to so heavily that they were visually upset. Many people did not quit by putting in a two weeks notice but by walking out in the middle of their shift, if that tells you anything.",Demanding perfection doesn't lead to better service. Assisting your servers and helping them without degrading them will encourage them to respect their place of business instead of trying to cut corners. Even the best employee will start to slip when they are only put under pressure and criticized for their performance.

Applebee's is very accomodating when it comes to your availibilty. If you have school, another job or something unexpected comes up such as a family emergency, they will work with you. You wont find another company more flexible with scheduling. They also have a program called Concord Cares that will help pay for unexpected expenses like a funeral or medical bills.

Aside from the couple of programs they have and the flexible scheduling, there's not much incentive for keeping your job. No raises for servers. Hosts pick and choose who they want to give tables to and they don't like to help clean off tables which they should do since the servers have to tip them out sometimes as much as $25.00 out of the servers tips. They need to pay the hosts an hourly wage so the servers can keep their money that they earned. Sometimes the managers get on power trips and treat the employees like slaves. And all black uniforms are ugly and depressing. Applebees is supposed to be known as a fun, laid back, family oriented casual dining place so we should be wearing colors and jeans. How professional do we need to look to serve people sandwiches and salads in a sports bar and restaraunt? We are going to our ""fun job"", not a FUNERAL!!!","Colors people!!!! Seriously. Change the uniforms! Even guests say stuff about it all the time. Black is depressing, not fun. And give your servers that have been there and have been dedicated raises once in a while. $2.13 is not enough when we get 5% and 10% tips more often than you realize. Pay the hosts mimimum wage so we can keep our money too!!! Put yourselves in our shoes. BTW, we are there to serve, not deep clean the facility.

If you weren't one of them, you could not expect any sort of remotely polite interaction or fair treatment. Servers spend way too much time talking, joking around, and playing pranks on new employees. They then blame the cooks and hosts/hostesses when they don't receive tips. They asked me to seat certain people in their section, based on the attractiveness, race, age, or gender of those people. Some attempted to bribe me by giving me large shares of their tips if I would agree not to seat diners of certain races or ages in ther sections (I did not accept this). I have seen employees stand right in front of guests and complain about having to serve them, not even caring that the people are sitting right there and listening.
