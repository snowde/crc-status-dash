The management is communicative and willing to work with your schedule. You're able to pick up shifts when you want, allowing flexibility in your weekly schedule as well. The amount of money that you make depends on your people skills, your ability to act under stress, and any other characteristics typical of a good server, which is my current position. Something that really struck me is how caring corporate is to it's employees. When hurricane Harvey hit, I was pelasantly surprised to find a nice compensation check in the mail from BJ's that was calculated by looking at how much I had worked the previous two weeks, and finding out roughly how much money I lost out on due to the days that our establishment was closed. Even though I lost next-to-nothing compared to many other unfortunate Houstonian's, this compensation was much needed and left a positive lasting impression on me from the company.","Everywhere you go you'll find some sort of issues with management, and BJ's is no different. I will say that in my time here, the cons are minimal and the biggest con for me is a personal problem, which is the commute to work. Anything else falls on minor communication issues, yet I listed their communication is still good otherwise. The only other thing that I can think of is the high-turnover rate of employees, meaning you may work with some people who aren't good at what they do, slowing you down or messing up your orders, and people who are shady, rude, or unprofessional. I feel as though this is common in many places. Lastly, shifts can be short if that's what you're looking for, but unless you're able to fill your section and stay busy for the entirety of that time, the real money is made staying on longer which isn't always an option.",Better screening process for applicants

I started as a server but it is definitely easy to move up from host, takeout, or food runner especially if you're working at a busy location. Management is typical of corporate restaurants - you get easy going ones and ones that are nitpicky. Tips are good, depending on location some are great. I would say you make an average of $100 during night shifts, a little less during the day. Good servers get to be in the better sections that usually have booths for families. They also use Hotschedules which makes it easier to get shifts picked up and to pick up shifts. It's a big staff so usually getting shifts covered and/or getting time off isn't an issue. I should say I had a great experience at Brea and Las Vegas.","It's hard to work at some locations that don't have enough items (silverware, parmesan cheese &amp; peppers, pizza stands, etc). I've only experienced this in the San Bruno location. Makes doing you're job very difficult. Sometimes managers will copy and paste schedule so you have the same schedule for 6 weeks straight (which could be good or bad depending on what your schedule is). Besides that - just the typical server stuff, difficult clientele sometimes, zero table turnover on game days if you're working in the cocktail. Oh and there is usually a decent amount of sidework both during and after your shift so it's not a really a get in get out type of shift. Lots of pre-bussing as well because a lot of the times the bussers don't do that for you. San Bruno was my only true negative experience, great people to work with but clientele wasn't the greatest and most of management didn't help make your job easier. Kitchen staff at this location was particularly bad - felt bad for the customers as the food almost always came out wrong, cold, or just looked bad. Had to deal with this because the customer can only yell at the server, not the cooks. For more detail check our their Yelp page.",

Had a lot of fun at work. Due to the online scheduling you can adjust your schedule to almost always work around your personal life. There was always money to be made, almost every shift, every day. I worked at a very busy location though. I loved the food and was always able to enjoy a good meal before/after a shift. (kinda expensive though). After you learn the menu and what is required of you as a server, the job is fun and easy, because ""everyone loves Bj's!"" and the people who come in are generally there to have a good time and enjoy good food.","There is a 100 question ""personality assessment"" you have to pass to get hired. The menu is huge and there is a lot to learn. You have a script to follow and secret shoppers come in to grade you, if you don't say the right things you could be fired. If you are ""in the weeds"" and need help, good luck, because most servers are overwhelmed themselves, and managers are likely not paying attention (unless it's a peak volume time- weekends). Also, any complaint from a guest is ALWAYS your fault. Management doesn't seem to understand that servers are human and can make simple mistakes. It's always the guest's word over yours. And that sucks. The reason I got fired was because I was in the weeds and I failed to fill up a guest's water. The man claimed I ""didn't want to wait on him"" when in reality I was overwhelmed with tables because the manager cut most of the servers (to save labor cost) and I couldn't keep up with all the tasks at hand. Of course, there was no one around to help me at that time. The white shirts you wear are a pain to keep clean as well. But a lot of restaurants have that uniform so no big deal. You are required to always run food, and this can hinder your ability to wait on your tables in a timely manner. If you like to hustle and work hard, this is a great job for you.","Management needs to worry less about saving labor costs, and more about helping out the servers and cooks. The kitchen was always behind and/or unable to keep up with the demands of a large restaurant. Also, the script you are required to say at the first visit to a table overwhelms the customers (along with the 20 page menu!) and I think it makes many people feel rushed or annoyed by all the ""selling""."

Ticket times are very long and mistakes are abundant. The manager cuts the floor so quickly that most of the time you go to work, you are cut after 2 tables.","Try practicing fairness on a daily basis. Instead of scheduling the same employees for the closing stations or the bar tops, rotate sections to all employees. Also, don't cut the floor as soon as others walk in the front door, since it does not even pay for the gas to get to work.

Hostesss are able to wear black dress pants, any kind of black shirt (or white during lunch), jewelry, and hair accessories. We also get free meals and drinks.","The management at this particular restaurant was poor. In order to save money, they make hostesses work like slaves. We are constantly running around the restaurant making sure everything is taken care of, yet the managers still find something to complain about. Recently we were yelled at for losing three parties one day. The guests thought that the wait was too long and decided to eat somewhere else, so of course the managers blamed us. Also, expect to be doing work well beyond what hostesses at most restaurants do. They refuse to keep enough staff working to make the restaurant run smoothly, so in order to pick up the slack we are made to clean the bathrooms, clear off tables, and wash silverware on top of seating people. On busy days it is impossible to complete everything while trying to keep up with the large amount of guests that need to be seated. So expect to be scolded for not being able to keep up with their ridiculous demands.<br><br>Some of my coworkers also made working here very unpleasant. Two of the girls up front are constantly rude to guests; I was always apologizing to angry customers because of them. These two are also very unorganized. Don't be surprised if they tell you to take a party to a certain table and then get mad at you for taking them there when you get back. It happened to me and other hostesses several times.<br><br>In addition, don't expect to get any hours your first few months of working. There were some weeks that I wasn't scheduled to work at all, yet the girls with seniority would work six days every week. Hostesses are also the only ones who don't get tipped; a five hour shift of working like a slave amounts to $40 before taxes are taken out. If you still decided that this is a place you want to work, expect to wait over an hour for an interview to then have a manager tell you to come back another day. This has also happened numerous time to applicants.",Please learn to be realistic about your expectations and treat your employees with respect.
