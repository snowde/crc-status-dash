Between the third and fourth day, depending on your floor manager, they will be expecting you to greeting guest and leading your trainer a few times. You should be able to handle a table on your own by the third day. The last day of training you have to get verified by the floor manager which is just serving them. I’ve never been a server so for me, the hardest part is learning the table numbers.
