I had very very low working experience (about 2 months in Food Service at Six Flags.) So I thought this was my big chance. I was interviewed at Chili\'s (arrived 10 minutes early) and two people came out. They said that they typically do a double interview process and that having the both of them interview me at the same time would be lot quicker. At first I thought it was a bit over whelming abut they were very funny and cool. I applied for Server, but I was 17 at the time so they told me to work in the Delivery to-go instead but I said I was turning 18 in about three days. And we shared a laugh. The way they were talking to me was initiating that I was going to work there. He even said ""we\'ll call you in for orientation in about a week."" I was soo happy.', ""A few days later the dreaded e-mail came. It said that they are regretting me for the job position- ON MY BIRTHDAY. I thought this was strange and called the place and the manger said that they need someone to work 40+ hours and because I can only wok on the weekends (I'm still in high school) I wouldn't be able to work there. I was devastated. I just told everyone EVERYONE that I had gotten the job.I now i have to explain that I didn't. I thought it was rather unprofessional of them to lead me one. I understand that they thought that because they were under staffed that I was ultimately going to work there but still very upsetting. Oh well, it's a good thing I applied to two chili's in my area and just yesterday got an e-mail to schedule an interview, so wish me luck.""]","[' It was mostly them talking, they seem to have already knew that I would be working there.', 'What have you learned in your previous working experience (for me it was Six Flags) \xa0 ', 'Answer Question']"

How you asked for the job and approached it in the beginning matters as well. Restaurant experience is mostly a must. Each personality type is broken down by the interviewer depending on who you get. They kind of gave me the ring around for awhile and were hard to reach and get information and follow ups from throughout. Each location can also vary with how you\'ll move up and if you want to pursue more in the future. The time also depends on how they interview and how you arrive. Overall it was a drag and took forever, you have to be on top of your stuff and seek out information or it won\'t be given at all. Asking questions also would be important as employers tend to leave many things out til the last minute or when your already hired. Use whatever information and mental notes and experience you have from past jobs. I\'m unsure if the company has changed for the better with this process by now, but this is the experience I had. Also, it\'s way worst if your going in as a teenager or even close to those years after that. Of course they\'ll take more advantage of you and won\'t want to tell you anything.

Luckily, they just so happened to be looking for cooks. Mind you, I have no previous experience in a professional kitchen. I walked in, applied, and asked to submit my application in person (always a good move). She sat me down and briefly read through my application, asking a few questions here and there and told me to come back in a few days, so I did. When I came back, the manager who was going to interview me told me to come back for testing a few days later. When I came back for testing he brought me over to a table with a few scales, some dry rice, dry pasta, a glass of water, and some empty ziploc bags. The test had two parts: the first was to read a recipe and do some basic conversions (there was a conversion chart on the recipe page, but it is always better to impress them by knowing the conversions by heart), and the second portion used the scales to measure out some of the dry ingredients and portion them into the bags. I recommend staying cool and not worrying about the clock. Focus, instead, on accuracy and cleanliness. He brought me to the front of the store while he graded my test, came back and hired me on the spot making $10/hr. working Salad/Nacho. Five days of paid training are included.""]","[' What position are you applying for? \xa0 ', '1 Answer']"
