3.0,"Nov 14, 2017","Former  Employee  in Culver City, California","["" Need to work at least 35 hours, and most hourly do not, so don't get the good benefit package. Most are eligible for hospital only benefits or low benefit package, so better just to get your own health insurance to be covered.""]"
2.0,"Sep 01, 2017","Current  Server/Bartender  in Raleigh, North Carolina","[' There definitley are benefits available, but you have to work at least 30 hours a week to be able to enroll in them and most employees are scheduled less than 30 hours a week.']"
1.0,"Jun 20, 2017","Former  Kitchen Manager  in Queens Village, New York State",[' Best is Atnea health and worst is vacation policy. You can only go away when they eant you too.']

3.0,"Mar 13, 2017","Current  Employee  in Dallas, Texas",[' They are not very clear as to what works for each individual person. The packages are also really expensive.']
4.0,"Nov 06, 2016","Former  Employee  in San Francisco, California",[' For an hourly position this company has good benefits']
3.0,"Nov 04, 2016","Former  Server/Waitress  in Brookhaven, Georgia",[' I never received benefits but I do think they were provided after a certain length of time or hours. There was free food to take home everyday of your training and they were usually alright giving away screw ups so free food is a perk. You receive an employee discount.']
4.0,"Aug 05, 2016","Former  Community Brand Ambassador  in Raleigh, North Carolina","[' Optional health benefits, I believe there is dental and health insurance. No paid time off since I was working an hourly position.']"
4.0,"May 20, 2016","Current  Employee  in Los Angeles, California","["" The benefits package at CPK is pretty comprehensive. Medical is pretty expensive but I think that's the case pretty much everywhere.""]"
2.0,"Aug 01, 2016","Former  Employee  in Kansas City, Missouri",[' They did not really offer us any sort of benefits package for health insurance or 401K. As a Server/Bartender/Host this was nothing that you could receive.']

5.0,"Feb 03, 2016","Current  Host  in Las Vegas, Nevada",[' Best thing is insurance & tips earnings']
2.0,"Jan 18, 2016","Former  Employee  in Kansas City, Missouri","[' There really are not any benefit packages for this company. I believe if you are in management they will offer your Health insurance options and perhaps a 401K option. But, as a server there really was not anything at the time of my employment that they provided. You could opt in for an insurance plan, but anyone who has been a server knows that a servers minimum wage is so minimal that you barely ever receive a real paycheck.']"
1.0,"Jan 27, 2016","Current  Server  in Irvine, California","["" Best was 50% off employee meal... which use to be $1 after 3 years... but the new owner changed that. Also we use to be able to wear black pants, and now we have to wear jeans. As the minimum wage rises to accommodate for price increase, so does CPK's items, which is ridiculous and defeats the purpose of raised the minimum wage.""]"
3.0,"Dec 04, 2015","Current  Employee  in Huntington Beach, California","[' Decent benefits package, however only available to employee who work full-time. Part-time employees have no benefits. Must enroll online.']"
2.0,"Dec 02, 2015","Former  Employee  in Alpharetta, Georgia",[' No perks. I was surprised to find that there were no perks associated with this job. This is the case with most server jobs anyways']

3.0,"Sep 29, 2015","Current  Server  in Nashville, Tennessee","["" The best thing about the restaurant is the staff who you work with. The worst, is the company rewards program that isn't worth anything but getting customers to sign up still a mandatory aspect of the job.""]"

2.0,"Sep 08, 2015","Former  Server  in Lakewood, Colorado",[' The best thing about working here was the flexibility in the schedule. The worst was being dependent on tips.']
3.0,"Sep 06, 2015","Former  Hostess  in Palo Alto, California","["" As a part time employee I didn't get any benefits except I think medical was listed, but I had my Father's insurance at the time. Can't talk about any benefits really.""]"
5.0,"Aug 04, 2015","Former  Server  in Los Angeles, California","["" Obviously full-time employees receive almost all of the benefits listed below, but as a part-time employee you don't receive even half of that.

3.0,"Jul 12, 2015","Former  Line Cook  in Waikïkï, Hawaii","["" The environment is very legalistic; granted, it is corporate. It operates like a manufacturing line... If you honestly enjoy being a cook for your occupation, I'd recommend somewhere less bottom-line driven -- somewhere that management actually appreciates food.""]"

3.0,"Jun 21, 2015","Former  Server  in Boulder, Colorado","[' It takes a while to be eligible to receive a benefits package that is actually worth using. If you work 40 hours per week, you are eligible for the worthwhile package after 6 months I believe?']"

1.0,"Aug 07, 2014","Current  Manager  in Los Angeles, California","["" They offer a fairly generous vacation benefit to managers but don't let you take it, then tell you you have too many hours of vacation available so you can't accrue any more which means you lose that time. The insurance package has changed 3 times in 5 years, each time for the worse. The work from home program is in addition to your regular 60 hour week, not part of it. The bonus program has changed so many times in the last 5 years that I don't even try to calculate it anymore. We do get a generous discount program but most of us never use it because if we came in with friends or family we would spend the entire meal dealing with employee issues and honestly, I see the food all week, why would I come in and eat it on my very precious time off?""]"
