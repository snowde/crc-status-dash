Only a couple of questions were asked and the job was basically given on the spot.

This usually leads to less than satisfactory results so a better screening process would be preferred. For those looking to get a job asap, with little hassle, this may work for you. However, the imbalance of work ethic due to the way they choose to interview and lack of care for the employees they hire is frustrating.']","[' Why do you think you would be good for this job? \xa0 ', 'Answer Question']"

They didn't really ask a lot of questions just basically looked over my resume and asked questions about previous jobs. I was offered a position and I accepted however after 3 weeks I still hadn't heard any details on when my training would begin so I called and the GM who did one of my interviews said he didn't remember me and to come in the next day so we could figure out when my training would begin. When I arrived the next day I told him who I was and why I was there, he had me sit at a table and said he would be right back. After about 10 minutes he came back and asked my name and then asked me what time my interview was that day. I explained I had already been hired and just needed to find out when my training was. We talked a little and he took my info and said the training manager would call me that friday (this was on a wednesday). Its now been 3 weeks since that conversation and I am still waiting for the training manager to call me.
