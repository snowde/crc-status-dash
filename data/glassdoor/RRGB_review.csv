Ziosks make things easy for the servers because most guests will pay on them.,"A lot of the guests that come in are low class and I got bad tips more often than at other serving jobs I've had. Fortunately, you get a lot of tables so you can still make very good money. Management pushes you to upsell and get good guest surveys constantly. They tell you that if you do well you will get more closing shifts and higher up sections. However, my scores were consistently good but the best shifts were still always given to the servers with seniority. Sections were divided so that guests with kids are seated in a different area. Sometimes a certain section would be sat much less while the other section was overwhelmed. It made no sense!",Understand that there are things that servers cannot control.

They were not managers, just servers, and they always had an attitude, acted absolutely entitled, and complained constantly. I was harassed almost daily by one employee and nothing ever got done about it, which leads to my next point.<br><br>2. The managers (except for 2 who no longer work with Red Robin) treat everyone like dirt. You are beneath them and they make sure you know that. They do not care about resolving your problems and their answer to ANYTHING that you are unhappy with is ""There's the door"".<br><br>3. The clients.

I had to kiss a lot of booty.<br>   You get half off one meal the day you work.,"The company gives outrageous numbers to meet. Starting on the managers...like Robin offer bottomless freckled lemonades but will only give the store credit for one and a half per guest while most drink like 4 or 5. So managers are always over used on product which forces them to only put ounce of strawberries when the recipe requires two ounces and I am pretty sure they water down the sodas to make up for it. That is just one example. So all the food is being shorted to make up for unrealistic expectations, there for cheating the guest on everything. They have to cheat times and make workers work more than one job code and always run short handed. They offer bottomless fries but won't give them to you unless all the food is sold, what do they care it is your tip not theirs. Robin has raised prices so much that they have to give out free food to get guests to even come in. Guess who doesn't get tipped on free food. Funny you still have to do all the work though. They are pulling expediters and planning on pulling busser jobs to save money. They would rather pay servers $3 an hour to do all those jobs...what do they care it is your tips not theirs if you don't have time to serve the guest.<br>   You are graded on drinks per guest but some appetizers are counted as guests so you have to add waters to check them out. I was told that is because the company lies to their share holders to make it look like they have a higher guest count....guess who it hurts, the server.<br>  People slip and fall all the time in our restaurant but they won't fix the slick floors.<br>   I have had crew meetings where district managers say stuff like...we are not required to give breaks...and we are doing these things for you ha ha nothing is done for the employees at all. Everyone I work with hates the company. Even the managers have said how greedy this place is.<br>  You have to use the table machine to order things and check people out but half ours are broken...guess who still gets graded on it, you. No excuses even if you don't have the tools to do your job.<br>   All of the dishes come out dirty, gross. People eat off this stuff, why is that not an issue.<br>  Red Robin took away raises and stopped giving them when the economy crashed what like 8 or 9 years ago and took away our 401ks and they are not coming back.<br>   The store puts on a show when the bosses are there but it is filthy with trash everywhere and no one wears gloves when they are not there.<br>   Half the workers have to do all the side work and the other half get to just make money and leave to save labor.<br>   I personally have seen several labor laws broke and employee mistreated several times.<br>   You won't have enough glasses or silverware because they can't order more...it would hurt the numbers and managers might not get their bonus.<br>   The bartender has to take and bag all the to go order even though they rarely get tipped on them.<br>   So say you make it to a closer position. They will cut all the employees off the floor and you will have to seat the door, serve, expedite the food, and buss your own table while 2-3 managers sit around and eat. They say it is a daily meeting but just talk about what they did last night or whatever. The poor guests have dirty tables all around them and have to wait on everything. This is hilarious because my store is a training store and trains managers, I can only imagine how bad other stores are. I have direct orders to throw certain things out or change things when health inspectors come in.<br>   Don't eat here after 8pm because kitchen workers are cleaning walls, vents, and fryers and do not wash hands when food is rang in. They are also cussing you because you interrupted them.<br>   I will see managers sit around for hours but won't give you time to go to the bathroom.<br>   The computer system is terrible, goes down all the time. Don't even have buttons for some of the items.<br>  The air conditioning is directly over the guest so they are always cold and you are alway hot and sweating. Let me add. I work in Missouri and our thermostat is controlled by their head quarters in like California or something. They don't turn on the air until we open...so you are a sweaty mess by the time you start. Heck half the time they won't even turn on the lights, you might have to open in the dark.<br>   Your paycheck won't even cover half of your taxes.<br>   Good luck getting ahold of HR they obviously don't care about any of this. You will not get a call back.<br>   Our store to get trainers was like, anybody wanna be a trainer? So our trainer suck.<br>There is no incentive to train what so ever.<br>    I watch managers just eat food off the line.<br>    Have had to bend my morals many times.<br>    You have to work all holidays, nights, and weekends if you want to make money.<br>    Bosses will lie straight to your face.<br>    Anything the company does ends up making you less money.<br>    Company has a giving fund where they take credit for helping employees, but the money comes from us, every employee has to give a dollar a check.<br>    Many more things I can't think of at the moment.","Stop being YES men. I mean if something isn't right bring it up to your boss or their boss.

(30 minute ticket times are typical for a slow shift, and when our restaurant is busy, our guests often wait upwards of an hour OR a lot of tables will end up leaving without eating and very angry) -Part of the problem is that the cooks don't have very much incentive to work hard, bc their pay rate rarely increases. The other problem is the kitchen is bumping tickets way before the food is actually done, so that corporate thinks that our ticket times always run around 7-8 minutes (LOL) so that the managers can keep their jobs. When they bump the ticket before the food is done, it almost always is at the expense of order accuracy and recipe adherence-so now the food not only took forever but the guest will not even receive what they ordered- I never knew such an embarrassingly flawed system could even exist!!! 4. Corporate does not allot enough money for management to staff the restaurant properly. 5. Because of the exorbitant profit resulting from any and every possible corner being cut, I am thinking the people who make up the board room (Senior/Executive-level Team Members) must be making an ungodly amount of money!!

For 10 years, it was the People that made it for me. I forgot I earned a paycheck because of the People that I was honored to work with. I also had a tremendous amount of growth, both personal and professional and to this day, still rely upon the lessons I learned. Celebrating success used to be a BIG DEAL and to some degree, it still is but measured and honestly, scrutinized. Pay was very good and if you performed well, bonus payouts were industry leading. All in all, not many tangible things that I can poorly rate.","Many on here have discussed how poorly people are treated today. Many have discussed the scorecard, short staffing, poor Mgmt., etc. Though this company, like many others does have challenges in these areas, I personally don't think it is out of the ordinary for people to feel this way, especially if they are being performance managed in a large company expecting best in class results in an extremely competitive industry. I do NOT fault RR for evolving their culture to become more performance based. They had to as the pendulum of HAVING FUN had swung too far the other way. BUT, where I identify the ""Con's"" of working here has to do with the environment that has been created. What has been created is a culture of fear. A culture of fear to deliver results at all costs. It is this culture that is at the root cause of many poor decisions that many have made over the last few years. No doubt, poor decisions that have cost jobs have been made by many. From the hourly team member level to the Director level, each of those individuals are accountable for the poor and questionable decisions they have made. But when they have to chose from putting food on the table and a roof over their head for their kids to doing what is right for the business, the fear of turning in a bad result has superceded the decision to acting with integrity, because having perceived GREEN RESULTS, buys you another day of work and pay. I was in that position many times and I chose integrity and ethics, and was chastised and shunned by my peers and supervisors. Many, not all of my peers, chose the route of delivering results at all costs. Most of those individuals are no longer there. When speaking with them, they overwhelmingly admit to cheating to save their job, and at the end, lost their job because of cheating. Others lost their job by doing their best and being transparent, but not delivering the result the company demanded. Though they were high performers in the past, they are now labeled poor performers. A small amount of those there today can deliver results and they are rock stars. But they feel very afraid of falling off that mountain. They have seen what happens when there is a slight glitch. They feel that they must be perfect. They are afraid of having a bad day.","I firmly agree that RR had to swing the pendulum. But the path they took to get there could have been different. There are some extremely smart people at RR, and know about this culture of fear. They are just too afraid to do anything about it. They hang there hat on ""You gotta deliver the result."" Yes results can't be compromised, and above all are non-negotiable. But it can be done in an environment without being afraid."

And low quality food for too much money... Expos recently got tips taken away, which in the many years I've worked there, this is the second time red robin has changed how much their employees should get paid... Very unethical.. And they don't show any concern for it what so ever. It's solely just ""surprise, like it or not you no longer are going to be making money."" Servers are also angry about this as they know the work ethic of the expos will go down because before they were willing to help in any case, now they won't, servers are not paying them... On top of that they have taken away 50% off on any food for team members that actually do the hard work for the restaurant and give 250$ per quarter to most corporate employees... Every time these corporate employees come into my restaurant they barely tip 15%... Really? Honestly red robin treats there employees like trash, at least the ones that work within the restaurants.... But then they expect everyone to go above and beyond with a smile on their face when nothing is given in return except the false promises of a ""great future"" for red robin... In all the time I have worked here I have watched this company slowly drown... It is a failing company that always is making changes in hopes that it will grab the guests and keep them coming back...but guests are looking else where now... With all the other options like five guys that actually serves fresh food not half microwaved food or hockey puck burnt burgers, at half the cost, I don't blame the guests... A couple weeks ago, a guy in my kitchen was yelled at because he threw away 16 burgers that had freezer burn and we're pure grey, he has pictures to prove, unlike the regular uncooked burger color of red... That manager on duty had said that we really needed to watch food cost... So, bottom line, employees within the restaurants are being trained to serve poor food to guests to save red robin money, degraded for choosing to do the right thing, and lastly the guests are NOT getting good quality food... What kind of company is this? I am very passionate about this kind of stuff, and this is morally wrong.. The people at the top should be ashamed of themselves!","Treat employees like humans... And corporate really needs to try and understand its market... People want good food that tastes great and is fresh at a decent price... There is no reason to charge 15$ for a burger because it's angus patty... And stop making changes on how much people make an hour by decreasing it.. Cutting peoples pay no matter how you do it, within the law or not is wrong... Your employees have mouths to feed, bills to pay too, and most are going to school and paying for it! We're not just dogs...Please try and remember those things... It would be very appreciated"

This is just how the restaurant is set up and will not change anytime soon.,Continue to listen to employees and look for incentives to keep employees working hard. Management should be positive on the floor and be willing to help out. Servers vibe off the management so managers need to lead by example.

Management is willing to work with you and try to keep you happy.","The types of customers this place attracts were a killer for me. Unfortunately, a large amount of the patrons that frequent Red Robin in Hendersonville are nothing more than trash. Anyone who has worked in the service industry knows the kinds of demographics I'm talking about (teens, rednecks, and ninjas). That being said, getting stiffed on tips was a very common occurence.<br><br>A lot of people want restaurant service on McDonald's money. They will be your most demanding customers and will smile to your face, thank you for the service, and then leave you nothing or an amount that serves as an insult. I don't know if people don't understand the fact that servers make just over $2 an hour, and are dependent on their tips, or they just don't care.<br><br>Management is aware and symapthetic to the problem, but there really isn't anything they can do about it. I mean management's bottom line is sales, so at the end of the day you might get a ""that sucks, I'm sorry"" from them but as long as the bill is paid they don't care. Throw on top of that the fact that once your cut, you are no longer taking tables that net you money but you still have about 45 minutes to an hour of side work where you are working for essentially nothing. There were more than a few nights I walked out of there not even averaging minimum wage.<br><br>Additionally, management gets all wrapped around the axel if your table orders water as a beverage. I understand that it is both in the restaraunt's and the servers' interest to get people to order sodas, teas, beers, etc. But management actually assigns a percentage number to you as a server and then gives you placement on the seating chart with the higher your number is. Essentially if you have a table of four and two of them order water to drink then your number is 50%. They look at anything below a 75% as bad. I never really understood the high emphasis put on this, because I can recommend all the freckled lemonaides in the world, but if someone wants water they are going to order it. Finally, management gets super worked up about the royalty program. The program is basically a card people get that they can swipe each time they eat there and eventually earn free meals. I get the reasoning behind the program, but the priority that is placed upon it just baffles me. They want you to start every greet with ""Hello, my name is ________, are you all members of our royalty rewards program?"". If they aren't then they want you to start explaining the program to them and telling them how you are going to sign them up for it. This makes for some very unnatural greets, because you have a table just staring at you like some used-car salesman while the whole time they just want you to take their drink order.<br><br>If you are thinking about waiting tables in the Hendersonville area I would really recommend going somewhere that has a higher average bill. I'm not saying you will be immune from crappy customers, but chances are the higher prices on average will drive away a lot of the rift-raft.","No criticism of management, because as I said earlier a lot the restaurant's problems are systemic to the people that choose to go there."
