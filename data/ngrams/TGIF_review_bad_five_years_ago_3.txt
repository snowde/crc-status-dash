Many good hourly employees fall between the cracks when management and home offices follow the 'customer is always right' policy. Friday's will give away food or fire hourly employees at the drop of a hate to appease its customers. Those things do have to happen some times, but they happen weekly, or in some cases nightly, at Friday's. Also, there is no clear path laid out for hourly employees that shows them Friday's could be a career, and so many of them see it as, 'my job right now.'.

Schedules aren't e-mailed and It took forever to get a manager to give it to you through the phone. Making change and tipping out kind of sucked especially if you didn't make any money that day because you got cut super early. Nothing is ever good enough, there is little to no recognition, the home office is no support center, Sometimes you have customers that will try to use many discounts which likely lowers tip, customers can be very ignorant depending on location...managers won't do anything about it and will likely take their side even if the manager knows the customer is in the wrong, schedule can be very hectic: sometimes you work doubles without a breather if it's too busy.
