Nothing they are terribly despicable not crazy about these requirements so I will try to put anything to get through Havana, if this is not 20 words than I am adding a few more good flexibility but this company skates on the edge of the law when it comes to HR friendly coworkers and great atmosphere Great training program, Great Management I worked as a host, and I had the opportunity to become a server within 2 months of working there Due to the small staff currently needed to run the floor, you can occasionally make money, mostly fun employees, server manager's enthusiasm It was an OK job. Fun work environment Great training if you want to continue bar tending Good place to work you stay for more than a year 401K and benefits are available The food is pretty good, the DOS are good people who care, IT is improving Flexible scheduling for kids in college I like working for a corporate company versus a family owned business. Managers were nice I liked it a lot it was great there I had a ton of fun at Fridays the food was amazing and I got to east it for free managers were nice I liked it a lot it was great there I had a ton of fun at Fridays the food was amazing and I got to east it for free The company provided good 401K benefits, health care benefits, and corporate discount card to use at all restaurants. The discount isn't bad but it could be better with everything that is asked of a server and the kinds of customers that is dealt with on a day to day basis flexible hours, meet lots of people, lots of pretty girls, schools nearby, public transportation, a lot of bars Your fellow co-workers become family to you. Semi diverse staff The salary is a little above minimum wage, the waitresses are nice Fast paced and fun environment, easy job opportunity, and little responsibility outside of what they ask if you suck at your job good co workers and food was good Easy environment, and fun atmosphere Staff at the same pay level as you are nice Opportunities for growth, can work independently The Annual Pay was pretty good to start and the benefit of the Black Card for unlimited food purchase Menus are easy to memorize and the food taste good which helps when trying to help people order. The main reason I was there was because they worked with my school schedule and I made good money at first Friendly management, get busy, food and drink discounts cash tips Flexible hours with long/good length shifts, consistent schedule, good pay for starting job, detailed computer training so all employees learn the same thing, decent benefits, fun co-workers, very LGBT friendly, could usually get time off if requested in advance, fast-paced environment, will train you for bar tending and even becoming a manager if you are willing to stay there for long enough, corporate is very responsive and you are very likely to see the company owner visiting your restaurant to check in occasionally. This is a great place to work, only issue is if you're a student some managers over look the fact that you go to school (or work two jobs) and schedule you shifts that you can't work and then it's up to you to find someone who can cover you shift GOOD PAY, easy job, friendly guests uses hot schedule so easy to release and pick up shifts I like the friends that I have made and some of my regulars. Everyone that works there knows exactly what you go through, and you need them to get through your shift. Money to be made if you are willing to work. Training program- although extensive, it was helpful and taught you what you needed to know In my location in Porter Ranch CA most of the people I work with servers/buskers/cooks are very friendly and up beat. I enjoyed working there because the hourly employees were fun, the food is usually good, and the atmosphere was up-beat.
