It's a job, if you're luck enough to work during a busy shift it will pay the bills stable business with fun atmosphere and staff Management is very lenient with enforcing rules, flexible schedule, if you're serving you most likely wont be working past 11 p.m. Most of the guest were friendly made great friends, learned a lot of ins and outs to the restaurant, learned some great bar tending skills. Good benefits and the salary can be a little better than other companies Flexible schedule, great co-workers, fun lively environment The atmosphere is so much fun and the management is really respectful. I made a ton of good friends that I've kept over the years, I learned how to bar tend which opened up many other jobs for me since, and I now bleed red and white stripes Good food and atmosphere. I enjoyed working there because the hourly employees were fun, the food is usually good, and the atmosphere was up-beat. They also have a number of different benefits available (depending on if the store is Corporate of Franchise).

Fun environment and manager are OK Friday's is now so overlooked by the public that a busy restaurant is a rarity, so the work is much easier than it used to be. It's now very easy to get a job here if you're trying to get a foot in the door of the industry, though staying past the three year mark is a mistake, as it will stain your resume for future employers.
