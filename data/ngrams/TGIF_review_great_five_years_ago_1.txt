Great managers, very fair, great place to work You get a choice on how you dress, Just as long as it is black. Discount. Coworkers are super cool. The hours are regular, the food is good (half price meal during shifts), and in my location most of the managers were relatively understanding. If for some reason you have to move, It is very easy to transfer to another T.G.I. The training can be demanding but they are highly regarded as one of the best restaurants to learn how to wait tables and tend bar. Many times, one is able to have other employees cover a shift the same day or to pick up an extra shift from someone not waning to work that day. They also have a very nice program called the “passport system” that allows an employee to pick up shifts at any other TGI Fridays location just by showing proof of training in the position via your “passport” that you have to sign up for beforehand.
