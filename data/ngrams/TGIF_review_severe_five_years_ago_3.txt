Too many coupons, a lot of times, managers are too worried about making the right survey scores than they are the actual situation Terrible customers. The managers are constantly changing the schedule so if you're not checking it every day you will wind up missing a shift change. Company constantly sides with customers who are ridiculous and only complain to get free food out of the deal, too much “stuff” to have to worry about telling guests about, constantly changing things for the worse, never asking employee feedback on anything, ZERO appreciation Negative environment. There were not enough hours in the day to do everything that corporate and the regional manager wanted. You'll meet druggies, managers that shouldn't be managing anything, unprofessional ism among st employees and an extremely high turn over because most waiters/hostess quit as soon as they discover working at Friday is NOT in any way glamorous OR FUN. Food is sub par and kitchen is also often dirty. Managers are bias-you could be a mediocre or horrible server but if a manager likes you, you'll move up or get a “pass” on the SAME things that another server gets yelled at about. Company is so disorganized which results in you not getting your schedule days BEFORE you work. This type of job unfortunately allows the worst type of language and treatment of coworkers while management turns a blind eye. Very demanding hours late night and long When I started with this company in the early 90's, it was still the company that others imitated. The management staff is now a revolving door of fools, as they no longer pay above the mid $30's. When it's busy and you work a double it can be hard to get a break...which is illegal!. Closing shifts require long hours, management is very dense and not very knowledgeable, lots of bureaucracy, not supportive of taking time off, work/life balance is not that great, management expects your life to be GI Friday's, and there are a lot of tedious and unnecessary rules.
