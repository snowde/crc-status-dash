Was allowed to be a bartender when the senior bartender left to get a new job but when they rehired him/her they cut the hours back. The company has lost its touch, it's gone down a spiral of set destruction where it's not willing to invest money in either it's customers or it's employees which reflects in their decreasing volume of sales and their increasing turnover. They Damaged their ribs in order to fire up the brand again but it is another failed attempt at the same old bad choices they have made over the past 3 years. The training is sub par and often times Its are pulled prior to their training completion in order to cover other restaurants. Donâ€™t recommend The only thing that I didn't like was that there was no room to grow Don't care about employees at all Bad management, bad atmosphere most of the time. Management has a series of worries about their job, a director of operations has the same fears for his, and so on, and this stress is directly transferred to the boots on the ground. Everyone is looking for an excuse to terminate someone, and managers frequently develop groups of favorites around them, which means you could be targeted by a rival manager for the smallest of infractions. Horrible management, horrible clientele, no consistency, sexual harassment runs rampant throughout the staff, employees are never set up for success, the general manager is lazy and incompetent. Terrible management at the Gloucester branch especially kitchen, management bad clientele, endless apps, can get fired for telling another employee that you wish to leave this job once you find another one.some managers will take party gratuity off for no good reason Lazy co workers that only care about their tables camp; nothing else around them. One manager is big into sexual harassment and refuses to stop while the rest of management has absolutely no clue what they're doing. The hours, the pay, the management was horrible.
