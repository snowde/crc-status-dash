Earliest to request off is a month -Sometimes Management is hard to find when you need them (you will need them if you need them to take stuff off the bill or talk to a guest)<BR><BR>-Tips can fluctuate depending on the section your in (there are some sections that are better than others because of the amount of tables they turn hourly)<BR><BR>-Kitchen is a lot of the times slow. (this affects the happiness of your guests because a lot of the times their entrees will come out before their appetizer or they will be waiting around 30 min for a salad) Lots of employees tend to leave because being not liking the job<BR>Scheduling can lead to almost no rest period Depends on which location you work. The managers put so much pressure on you so they get their bonus Hostile work environment, bad tippers due to this particular location being a part of an outdoor mall, Bad Management, Awful scheduling (coworkers often being scheduled double shifts without break time) Constant turnover (people would put in their two weeks after only working a week due to the lack of money being made) heavy focus on pitching food items and corporate interference. They give you a really hard time if you have to call out for a shift, they don't really care if you're sick or have personal things going on they just want a body to fill the position whether you're in a good position to work or not. Hit or miss, this means unsteady pay<BR><BR>Closing shifts start at 4:00 and end at midnight, meanwhile the day person only actually has to work for 5 hours and you clean up their mess for the same pay.<BR><BR>Scheduling is all over the place, prepare for a tornado of a schedule that can go anywhere from 6 days a week to 2 days a week for no reason<BR><BR>To-go becomes the bar's responsibility as well (Have a full bar?. The restaurants are too large and, at times, too busy to accommodate to “gold standard”.<BR><BR>Quality of product can greatly fluctuate and the system in place for getting prepared food from the kitchen to the table is weak.<BR><BR>Bartenders and other “tipped out” employees are never guaranteed their money from other team members. Long work hours.<BR>Managers comes and goes.<BR>Very little supervision from the upper management to keep the check and balances of the restaurant, very heavily relied on the general managers who could not be very good.<BR>It feels like managers are a just a number to them, the work that you do goes unnoticed a lot of the time. If you want to work in a place where there's no communication and your coworkers and managers treat you like you're the scum in the bottom of the sink then this is the place for you. One of those decisions was to set one of the main TV's on the fox channel news, but the decision that really went straight to the heart of this company is the implementation of the 1/9 verify program...... I am an independent when it comes to political affiliation, but I can see this company its run by a true Republican, not wrong or bad but they should be more discreet about their political preference. - Extremely high expectations that cannot always be delivered<BR>- Fast-paced, and very stressful during peak hours or when under-staffed<BR>- High management relocation, hard to develop a strong relationship<BR>- If you have lazy coworkers, there is a lot of slack to pick up<BR>- Multiple managers giving conflicting directions<BR>- Constantly changing menu and promotions, hard to keep up with<BR>- Dealing with drunk/belligerent guests<BR>- If the manager doesn't like you, your schedule can be undesirable<BR>- No longer add gratuity to large parties (as of 3/2013) Management was scatter brained.
