Very corporate, they would rather you be a robot than be yourself. Earliest to request off is a month -Sometimes Management is hard to find when you need them (you will need them if you need them to take stuff off the bill or talk to a guest)<BR><BR>-Tips can fluctuate depending on the section your in (there are some sections that are better than others because of the amount of tables they turn hourly)<BR><BR>-Kitchen is a lot of the times slow. (this affects the happiness of your guests because a lot of the times their entrees will come out before their appetizer or they will be waiting around 30 min for a salad) Lots of employees tend to leave because being not liking the job<BR>Scheduling can lead to almost no rest period Depends on which location you work.
