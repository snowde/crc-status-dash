The management is top of the line and always in sync with each other - which reflects on the atmosphere of the store and the amazing team work among st the staff. Even as a host, you make more than minimum wage, and it's very easy to work your way up to being a server, as the industry has such a high turnover of workers. I have worked here for 2 months, and I have already moved up to Take-out (the next position), and I am looking to move into a server position in the next couple months. Flexible hours the management is willing to work with you for time off and will go above and beyond to help out as long as you are doing your job and taking care of your responsibilities. Lots of experienced employees -Once you have been there for a couple months, and start to get accustomed to the menu, you will make good money<BR>-Walk with your money every night<BR>-For a college student like myself paying his way through college, it's a great gig. Weekends you should make anywhere from $110-200/night on average<BR>-Management is super nice and fun for the most part<BR>-Half price food days you work, 25% off for days you don't Really easy to get a shift covered or pick up someone else's shift. Good money for short hours working with a team, getting to know people with different interests, the harder you work the more money you make for the most part, regulars are usually always nice to talk to able to pick up shifts and release instantly I worked here through college. To me, the people you work with camp; the relationships you build at work kind of make or breaks, but I'd have to say that I think I'm surrounded by a pretty chill group of co-workers camp; managers. We make more money than any of the other servers in the area and almost all the management I've met have been fun to work for. Good pay for delivery drivers if you consider that you hardly do any deliveries but when you do you get 10% of the bill and tip It is one of the busiest restaurants in the area.
