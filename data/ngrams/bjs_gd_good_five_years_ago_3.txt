Opportunity to move up in the company Easy script to remember at tables and lots of potential to make money. We make more money than any of the other servers in the area and almost all the management I've met have been fun to work for. Our store is a family, and while it's super stressful most of the time, we run like a well oiled machine that only comes with time, practice, and relationship. There is space and MONEY for team members to cross train, pick up bookkeeping in the office if that's your thing (read: real career, looks-good-on-a-resume, not-”hey-I'm-a-server” experience) WHILE still making daily money on the floor. Hours aren't terrible, some play with your schedule, great benefits, salary is good, lots of opportunity to grow and travel with the company!. Good pay for delivery drivers if you consider that you hardly do any deliveries but when you do you get 10% of the bill and tip It is one of the busiest restaurants in the area. Since I am a server, this is helpful because I am able to go home with a good amount of money in tips after my shifts. I can clock in and be out in five hours and make twice as much as someone working eight hours at a job paying double the minimum wage. I myself am a very outgoing person with good attention skills, and being able to work at a restaurant that utilizes it was great. If you are looking at getting into the restaurant industry, this is a great place to start, with good training and decent advancement opportunities.
