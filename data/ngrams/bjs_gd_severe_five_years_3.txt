Not good money<BR>Terrible management -Management is awful, they don't do anything but walk around the restaurant<BR>-Favoritism<BR>-Quality and guest satisfaction are not prioritized Don't acknowledge how many hours you requested when hired or stick to scheduling for the position they hired you for.<BR>Additionally they have management that acts like they are in high school causing drama and giving dirty looks when you ask them to speak with a customer or do something they don't want to do but is a part of their job Abuse workers with time frames regarding breaks/lunches. Too many promotional discounts, restaurant seems like its dying to better competition Working through the power hour doesn't feel worth it at times inconsistent scheduling<BR>difficult to get raises for hourly paid employees<BR>often miscommunication or complete lack of communication between managers<BR>New managers get hired without being fully trained<BR>Employees have to train new hires with no increase in pay - No gratuity for large parties<BR>- They send out too many coupons out to customers which evidently bring sales and tips down<BR>- They have secret shoppers Side work takes 2 hours to do.<BR>Unorganized management in newer locations. *There is not Employee Loyalty<BR>*Favoritism makes it difficult to get the hours you desire<BR>*Every Manager tell you something different- nothing is the same<BR>*Management team is very immature<BR>*Management doesn't listen to you if you need to change your availability and will schedule you to work during time even though you cannot<BR>*If you work a Lunch shift you get horrible hours (about 3-5), but if you work a dinner you get (6+ hours) Instead of making them equal people in the morning get screwed over.<BR>*Lack of Good Training<BR>*You have no idea when the schedule for the following week will be posted<BR>*If you message a Manager on Hot Schedules asking a question they NEVER respond Awful management<BR>Stand by shifts (illegal in CA)<BR>Servers didn't take home a lot of tips<BR>Too high tip outs Favoritism prevents you from getting the best shifts, no employee loyalty. -Highly unprofessional<BR>- Favoritism showed by Managers<BR>-Chaotic work environment<BR>-Fighting for hours due to slow business<BR>-Lack of discipline for employees who come to work late, no call-no show, call out all the time, don't do their work properly, etc.<BR>-Lazy Managers<BR>-Managers constantly on their phones<BR>-The unqualified and lazy get promoted faster if they kiss up to management<BR>-Hard workers aren't appreciated or respected<BR>-Managers aren't disciplined/fired for their behavior<BR>-Managers being friends outside of work/sleeping with employees<BR><BR>The list goes on. It's a cheating game, if u are honest, u will be judged for doing the right thing Management is all over the place, forced to work overtime if your replacement is there on time computer system and checkout process inefficient in comparison with other restaurants, menu way too large its like a college coursebook No tips, very limited advancement, low pay, irregular hours Long ticket times for food and mistakes in the kitchen Poorly managed, no overtime allowed Management treats you like a number, not a person.<BR>Managers play favorites and not merit based. This meant whoever was left would be working overtime to accomplish what would otherwise have been done at the end of the night.<BR><BR>Also, as my manager explained to me, the work week technically ended Tuesday night, so it was not unheard of for me to work an eight hour shift till past midnight, then be forced to stay till four in the morning working overtime to not only finish the dish pit, but to finish closing the stations of the cooks who had been sent home early...and then still be expected to show up at 7:30AM the next (oops, the same) day!<BR><BR>I quit after the third month working here, as my sleep debt was accumulating faster than I could manage it, and as much as I enjoyed many aspects of this job, I was left feeling anxious and depressed over putting my all into it and being taken advantage of as a result.<BR><BR>The last straw was when much of the full-time staff had their hours cut “because of Obama care”. Poor training<BR>Heavy Plates<BR>A lot of heavy lifting in general<BR>Plates of food are always hot, you do get burned<BR>”Full-Hands” motto, consistently carrying and walking around the whole restaurant with heavy plates<BR>Work you as hard as possible for the minimalist pay Being able to not get time off<BR>Blacked out days to request time off<BR>Never felt like Management really listened The general manager will degrade and talk down to you and make it know when she hates someone. The not so great guests long hours, crappy clientele, high turn-over thus servers are not very good -Uncaring co-workers<BR>-too many complaints all the time<BR>-terrible customer service reviews ALL THE TIME<BR>-kitchen never seems to have it together when needed<BR>-too many managers, promotes too much micromanaging<BR>-no room to improve yourself or voice your own ideas<BR>-company will make anyone who is able to suck up enough a manager, instead of hard working individuals who get passed up<BR>-lower managers (newer ones especially) think they are above the rules and are EXTREMELY hypocritical The side work amount is insane, you will waste gas just to go to work to be cut after you set up in mornings, so opening and closing shifts as a food runner or server your screwed.<BR>Nobody is fair with the tip outs. Everyone from gets screwed which leads to people skimming tips and not tipping out what they should.<BR><BR>Food runners shouldn't have to wait to get their tips, when their shift ends there should be a manager who correctly does the math based on the receipts for all the food run for their shift and tipped accordingly, because no waiter is going to tip a food runner the correct amount if they can just keep more money for themselves.<BR>Also food runners going home with TIPS is the most ludicrous system i have ever heard of in 20years in the restaurant business. BJ's puts up employee moral by making promises which never are followed through, so it does not appear that they look for loyal long-term employees, high turnover in kitchen which impairs staff to attend their own stations, and screamed at when not able to handle more than three stations, Horrible clientele, horrible management, horrible flexibility, horrible training SUPER corporate restaurant<BR>Some crappy regulars<BR>A LOT of work for a bartender for the money<BR>Can put incompetent people at the helm at times -Management staff is rarely on the same page for anything<BR>-Poor training of new employees<BR>-Poor performance is never reprimanded, so there is a general culture of mediocrity within the service staff Workplace drama, incompetent managers, biased hiring process.
