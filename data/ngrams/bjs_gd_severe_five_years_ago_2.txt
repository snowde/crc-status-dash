Corporate does not know what it is doing and does not appropriate enough funds for locations to operate The cons were many the management is horrible, they are unapproachable when they are stressed out. They know they're going to have to deal with customers that are angry so why did they become a manager if they can't handle the pressure. I left because we were always short staffed and they kept giving me more duties as if I got paid more or was a supervisor and blamed me for mistakes of my fellow co-workers they were not in a higher or lower position than me. organization is awful on weekends Poor management and business practices. West Corina BJ's has by far the worst management. Very unprofessional, biased and lack empathy/ consideration. A lot of bureaucratic measures, incompetent restaurant management, stand-by or on-call shifts The management is lacking, and the hours could be better
