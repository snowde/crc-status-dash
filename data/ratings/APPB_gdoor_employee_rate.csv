There was an over abundance of staff, so switching shifts on your own was easy. For a first time server, it is an OK place to start. If you can handle the atmosphere here, you will be able to get through any other restaurant. Casual environment where you won't be scrutinized for how you talk to the customers or to one another. Overall casual dress code and discounted meals.","Just another restaurant trained to micromanage the life out of their staff. Mostly management sits at expo and screams at their understaffed front of the house to run food. They actually have enough staff to have food runners and one server for every four tables but they make cuts to save money even if their service takes a huge hit and then they wonder why they have difficult lunches and dinners. There is a very small chance that you will be treated with respect unless you are close on a personal level with managers. They have VERY high expectations and instead of thinking ""What can I do as a manager to make it easier on my staff?"" many, many new servers will be taken to the back to get reprimanded and talked down to, and then expected to serve the rest of the night with a smile on their face.. . The atmosphere is so casual and shows such obvious favoritism to senior servers that the conversations border on inappropriate often, and many servers were spoken of in a harassing manner by both management and servers when their backs were turned.. . Theft was very common, and server books and money from the register would turn up missing constantly and there never seemed to be anything that upper management did to make the staff feel safe. The attitude was to hide your personal belongings and be careful rather than to assume the company would assist you in any way with this issue.. . After 10pm during the week, management cuts the back of the house down to two people and the servers are expected to space out their orders by five + minutes before ringing them in. Even with four tables in the restaurant the ticket times were always at 20 minutes because management wanted to save $$ and cut the BOH, resulting in poor service and unsatisfied customers.. . Customers are not there to appreciate your service. It's basically one notch above fast food for them, even if you are doing the same job that a server at a nicer casual restaurant would do. The tips are usually terrible, and you will have some of the most difficult tables in the industry coupled with hoards of teenagers and families with babies that leave a mess that spans half the dining room.. .  In my time at Applebee's, I didn't see one day go by without at least one server getting talked down to so heavily that they were visually upset. Many people did not quit by putting in a two weeks notice but by walking out in the middle of their shift, if that tells you anything.",Demanding perfection doesn't lead to better service.

They constantly cut hours and positions and expect everyone else to pick up the slack for the same pay. For example, while employed I witnessed management remove the expo, dishwashers, and prep. They expect the cooks to prep, wash dishes, stock, count inventory, unload trucks, and reduce ticket times in-between orders. The equipment is old, dirty, and constantly malfunctioning. They constantly change their products and add menu items to the point that even management has troubling remembering ingredients. The pos systems are running windows 2000 and constantly go down. They require that new employees go through two weeks of training. However, they are unwilling to pay an employee to do the training so the processes ends being a new employee on their own station while current employees from the other stations bark out instructions to them. If you fall behind and your ticket times go over the magical number they set, management will harass you from the other side of the line. They do not offer vacation, insurance, personal days, or benefits of any kind. You will have to work holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas eve. They do not allow gratuity or compensation for table complaints or unpaid checks. Employees are expected to show up regardless of weather conditions and are expected to stay open without considering the safety of their employees. Health codes prevent sick people from handling food but if you have a cold and call out they expect you to bring a note from a doctor. Did I mention they do not offer health insurance? Upper management set goals that are mathematically unreachable and expect store employees to explain why the store is down in sales. For example, they charge over three dollars for their soft drinks and when customers get water, they blame the servers for not up-selling beverages.They are terribly understaffed and have a very high turnover.","As a cookie cutter restaurant, you can differentiate your products in ways other than offering 85 mediocre menu items that slightly differ from the 85 menu items offered by the other cookie cutters restaurants.

Even then its maybe 5 minutes. Management never wants to pay you what your worth, and even if they could, upper management won't allow it. Everybody is expendable in their minds. They could always find someone dumb enough to work harder for less money.. Like i said corporate upper management always tieing the hands of lower management and have their noses in everything causes issues all the way down the chain.. .  Never get overtime. Also they base their labor on business for the day so if your scheduled say a six hour day but business is slow somebody is goin to have to go home.

Doesnt matter how hard you work or how many shifts and favors you do for them. it will never come back to you in the end.. . Management always focuses on everything you could be doing better or not doing rather then noticing what you excel at and anything extra you for the betterment of the restaurant.. . Next to no opportunity of moving up unless you plan on being there for over 10 years and even then they bring in people outside the business over promoting somebody within.. .

You want your employee's to care about your business, then you need to offer ""praise and reward"" instead of ""insults and what you do wrong"" approach. Hard to be motivated to work for a company who doesn't really care about you, your family, or the sorry tips the customer's give.. My point is, this Applebee's had no mandatory party of 6 or more tips. There was no limit set and I had a table of 20 before, to myself, no help from the manager's and this table was there for more than half my shift, took up my section, was loud, drunk, demanding, and overbearing. They ran up a bill of over $400.00 in food and drinks. The kitchen was SLOW preparing the food, floor manager nor the key manager would help make this a smoother transaction. I came out that night with a $3.53 tip on that table. Was SO upset because even in the situation, I kept my composure and maintained my professionalism. The only thing my manager told me and said to me was...""you learnt from this...didn't you!"" The job of a waitress should NOT be this hard when you are putting yourself through school and trying to make a living. The money I made that night wasn't even enough to tip out my bartender and host enough. POOR, POOR management!! This is why there is a high turn over in this field. The money and $2.13 an hour is not worth it!! No matter how hard you try to please, do your job, work your butt off, there is no credit where credit is due when you have a night like this. Not all places run and operate like this. Waitressing is a great way to make money and get you through life at that time and moment if you have a caring team and manager behind you. I recommend waitressing, just not at Applebee's! This was in 2012, I hear it is still no better!!

They promise for you to move up and be trained for promotion but never follow through. . We went through 6 managers while working there for less than a year.. . I don’t mind doing things outside of my job description but it then became expected to do things EXTREMELY outside the job description such as doing servers side duties for them (dishes, taking their food out, refilling their guests drinks, bussing their tables keep in mind my duty is to just seat customers). . They are over staffed yet somehow during shifts are always understaffed management try’s to spend as less on employees as they can which in turns brings horrible customer servers because three servers are serving the whole restaurant and one of those servers is also the bartender who has to make all specialty and alcoholic drinks for the whole restaurant.. . I found myself being a newbie training other newbies and doing it darn well but I had not been trained to train others or is it my duty that’s why they have designated trainers who are suppose to teach and observe them which they don’t cause they just said you do it.. . Management is a crucial part for things to go by smoothly and hiring good management needs to be done if not there are many scenarios where you can get push overs where the employees will do whatever the heck they want and you can get one where you get a straight up dictator who try’s restructure the whole psychology of the darn place and the employees and way things work and go and are which in turn creates a hot mess with employees to angry to do what you say.. . Servers or bartenders who have worked there for too long can get away with too much and seniority means something there and they know it so they take mean advantage and can easily steal tip money SPEAKING ON TIPS...... . Hosts only get 1 percent of all the servers tips who worked during your shift which normally I wouldn’t care because if my job went how it should have my job only entailed seating customers and maintaining cleanliness for the bathrooms and hosting area but they turned me and the word hosting into a fancy then they call “doing everything everyone else doesn’t want to do” i.e. train other employees, assist the servers in taking orders when they get too busy refilling their guests drinks, bussing their tables (which is their jobs or the buss boy which they refused to hire) refilling the ice chest, having me taken off the floor to do loads of dishes and rolling silverware in the back leaving a server to seat people at the door “if they have a chance”. My butt found my self having to direct a new hired and first time bartender how to do her job SHE AINT NEVER BARTENDED BEFORE AND THEY PUT HER AS A BARTENDER SOMEONE ASKED FOR A FIREBALL WHISKEY LEMONADE (an Applebee’s specialty alcoholic drink) AND SHE POURED A SHOT OF FIREBALL AND PUT A LEMON ON TOP OF IT ARE YOU KIDDING ME? But back to the original point 1 percent of tips when you do EVERYTHING THE SERVER JOBS ENTAILS EVERYTHING THEY HAD ME TAKING ORDERS.
