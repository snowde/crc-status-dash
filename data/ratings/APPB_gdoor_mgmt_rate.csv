Time went by fast because of how fast paced the job was.. a 12 hour shift would feel like a 6 hour shift. Had the coolest most easygoing coworkers. Usually had 40 hours a week and hours were stable resulting in a decent paycheck.,"Terrible management that liked to micromanage everything. Management treated most employees like disposable trash. Management liked who they liked and disliked who they disliked, it didn't matter how hard you worked, if management didn't like you, you would be treated with disrespect and scheduled the worst hours. In many occasions, the employees that were slower and did not care got the better hours and more respect than the ones that worked their butt off. New rollout added many new sandwiches to menu which made things more complicated during lunch. Corporate had strict rules about labor and food costs that had to be followed.. our store had very high turnover, so the food costs were fairly bad, which reflected on everyone. The raises were frozen for 6 months and still haven't been given up to the day I left. Some people were there for a year and a half and still didn't get a single raise. Most of management didn't care about their employees, just the bottom line, which was actually counterproductive because many didn't work very hard because management would find fault whether they worked hard or not. The words ""good job"" barely existed except between coworkers","You can make much more money if you respect your employees based on things such as work ethic, skills at the job, keeping cool during rushes, always being on time and never calling off, etc.. NOT based on if you like them or not. Focusing on the bottom line is fine but you should at least respect your employees and say good job once in awhile.

There was an over abundance of staff, so switching shifts on your own was easy. For a first time server, it is an OK place to start. If you can handle the atmosphere here, you will be able to get through any other restaurant. Casual environment where you won't be scrutinized for how you talk to the customers or to one another. Overall casual dress code and discounted meals.","Just another restaurant trained to micromanage the life out of their staff. Mostly management sits at expo and screams at their understaffed front of the house to run food. They actually have enough staff to have food runners and one server for every four tables but they make cuts to save money even if their service takes a huge hit and then they wonder why they have difficult lunches and dinners. There is a very small chance that you will be treated with respect unless you are close on a personal level with managers. They have VERY high expectations and instead of thinking ""What can I do as a manager to make it easier on my staff?"" many, many new servers will be taken to the back to get reprimanded and talked down to, and then expected to serve the rest of the night with a smile on their face.. . The atmosphere is so casual and shows such obvious favoritism to senior servers that the conversations border on inappropriate often, and many servers were spoken of in a harassing manner by both management and servers when their backs were turned.. . Theft was very common, and server books and money from the register would turn up missing constantly and there never seemed to be anything that upper management did to make the staff feel safe. The attitude was to hide your personal belongings and be careful rather than to assume the company would assist you in any way with this issue.. . After 10pm during the week, management cuts the back of the house down to two people and the servers are expected to space out their orders by five + minutes before ringing them in. Even with four tables in the restaurant the ticket times were always at 20 minutes because management wanted to save $$ and cut the BOH, resulting in poor service and unsatisfied customers.. . Customers are not there to appreciate your service. It's basically one notch above fast food for them, even if you are doing the same job that a server at a nicer casual restaurant would do. The tips are usually terrible, and you will have some of the most difficult tables in the industry coupled with hoards of teenagers and families with babies that leave a mess that spans half the dining room.. .  In my time at Applebee's, I didn't see one day go by without at least one server getting talked down to so heavily that they were visually upset. Many people did not quit by putting in a two weeks notice but by walking out in the middle of their shift, if that tells you anything.",Demanding perfection doesn't lead to better service. Assisting your servers and helping them without degrading them will encourage them to respect their place of business instead of trying to cut corners. Even the best employee will start to slip when they are only put under pressure and criticized for their performance.,2.6684273847979427,2.6684273847979427,2.6684273847979427,2.829545454545455,2.845142451022806,2.7940429136081306,2.6689649449993684,2.382952142994426,2.6684273847979427,"""Worked for Applebee's a long time.

It seems that common sense has been burned out of brains by over-active-Facebook logins and ""work ethic"" is thing of the past. There is very little pride that is kept amongst the staff and all are clocked in just to make a quick buck with the least amount of work possible. Because of this, tables aren't cleaned properly, floors aren't kept swept, the back of house is a Petrie dish for who-knows what, and the expo line items are rarely rotated and almost always just topped-off with new product.. . Now, on to our fearless leaders. The management turnover at this restaurant is ridiculous. In the last two years, this store has seen 4 General Managers, 3 Area Directors, at least a dozen salaried managers, and (Applebee's new trick for saving money) multiple key-hourly managers. Let's start with the key hourly managers first, since they really are the least influential to this company (Or the greatest, according to them). These ""managers"" are really glorified card holders that can do table visits and discounts. However, they also think that they are entitled to write employees up, instate new store policies, and treat employees as though they are beneath them. Again, you are glorified card holders, that is all.. . Next, we have the salaried managers. There's a spastic, disrespectful General manager whose newly coveted position has all wondering what he will be able to do for this store...if anything...there's the Kitchen Manager who's frequent trips away from the store always lead him to return to the store with what can only be assumed to be a vodka-induced buzz, and the Front of House Manager might possibly have the lowest IQ known to man. Seriously.. . This franchised store is one of about 35 owned by the same company.

Instead of ostracizing your staff when they ""under perform"", perhaps it would be better to try and find the problem and suggest several methods to fix it. (Remembering a simple ""please"" and ""thank you"" in these situations goes a long way toward getting these guys to actually want to do the work) Management could definitely use some sort of class on how to diffuse tense situations. It'd also be nice to get a little communication and feedback about areas of improvement, to replace the talking with other employees behind their backs with derogatory comments and childish jokes. Long story short, though, when my old boss enabled me to succeed, it wasn't hard to find those extra things to do because I cared as much about the store and the job I was doing to always go that extra mile. On the other hand, a boss that will only tell you about how bad you are doing and how lazy you are kinda makes you want to be that much more lazy.

Micro-managing to the extreme! For some reason, the shift change between lunch and dinner occurs at 4:00pm, but in many cases we receive a rush of guests at this time and it is nearly impossible for servers and hosts to keep up with who is on the floor and who isn't. I am not sure why this policy exists, but everyone thinks it is ridiculous and damages the experience of the guests. Management here also needs improvement. They do not communicate well with each other, and one of them is verbally abusive toward employees. I (and the other employees) are always talked down to by him as though we are stupid, even though this is far from true. Every week someone is in tears over the way they have been talked to. I am not given enough hours weekly (sometimes only one shift) and yet they keep hiring more hosts. I feel like I do not make enough money here to have to put up with verbal abuse and nonsensical policies. I plan to leave as soon as I have another option.","Treat your employees like they have brains, let them answer your questions when you ask them, and speak to them like you would like to be spoken to.

They constantly cut hours and positions and expect everyone else to pick up the slack for the same pay. For example, while employed I witnessed management remove the expo, dishwashers, and prep. They expect the cooks to prep, wash dishes, stock, count inventory, unload trucks, and reduce ticket times in-between orders. The equipment is old, dirty, and constantly malfunctioning. They constantly change their products and add menu items to the point that even management has troubling remembering ingredients. The pos systems are running windows 2000 and constantly go down. They require that new employees go through two weeks of training. However, they are unwilling to pay an employee to do the training so the processes ends being a new employee on their own station while current employees from the other stations bark out instructions to them. If you fall behind and your ticket times go over the magical number they set, management will harass you from the other side of the line. They do not offer vacation, insurance, personal days, or benefits of any kind. You will have to work holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas eve. They do not allow gratuity or compensation for table complaints or unpaid checks. Employees are expected to show up regardless of weather conditions and are expected to stay open without considering the safety of their employees. Health codes prevent sick people from handling food but if you have a cold and call out they expect you to bring a note from a doctor. Did I mention they do not offer health insurance? Upper management set goals that are mathematically unreachable and expect store employees to explain why the store is down in sales. For example, they charge over three dollars for their soft drinks and when customers get water, they blame the servers for not up-selling beverages.They are terribly understaffed and have a very high turnover.","As a cookie cutter restaurant, you can differentiate your products in ways other than offering 85 mediocre menu items that slightly differ from the 85 menu items offered by the other cookie cutters restaurants. Cut your menu, stop modifying recipes based on slight differences in ingredients, and be realistic with the ridiculous standards you set.

This is why I believe the Austin area is so low on managers people are jumping off this ship at a high rate. I think you should not immediately take the guests words when they complain to corporate. I have seen many times when people lie to try to get extra money or extra things for free. It seems like if the customer has a bad reputation in a town for behaving badly you wouldn't give them precedence. If several people are telling you the same thing you may consider it. We have allowed the customers to badger and mistreat the servers and staff. This needs to stop.

Also, my management team was very understanding and flexible with my schedule, but I had worked there for over three years for them to know I was a reliable worker.","You have to be willing to work late nights, unless you discuss only working days at your interview. It really is not fun working until 1 or 2am, especially on the weekends. Obviously, you are in customer service so the customer is always right. You have to have a lot of patience for dealing with needy diners. All in all, the negative experiences I had serving at Applebee's are greatly outweighed by number of good experiences, especially once you begin having regulars.",,2.5901921682378517,2.6766899385206226,2.6766899385206226,3.0598973607038125,2.7887496984715248,2.976480746151154,2.825854375782592,2.4624528032834636,2.62479127635096,"""Managet""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2016-01-11,Current,Restaurant Manager,Hooksett,No,No,Neutral,Full-time,More than 3 years,Nothing at all!

Great for a second job or say a single mom that needs a flexible schedule. Always opportunity to pick up shifts unless it will put you in overtime.","SOO many.. Brace yourself... Restaurant business is a terrible place to work.. . Have no appreciation for their good employees. No paid sick days, no paid vacation, no benefits, terrible raises, no bonuses, no holiday parties, etc. .  Fast paced, stressful environment.Typically never get a break unless your a smoker. Even then its maybe 5 minutes. Management never wants to pay you what your worth, and even if they could, upper management won't allow it. Everybody is expendable in their minds. They could always find someone dumb enough to work harder for less money.. Like i said corporate upper management always tieing the hands of lower management and have their noses in everything causes issues all the way down the chain.. .  Never get overtime. Also they base their labor on business for the day so if your scheduled say a six hour day but business is slow somebody is goin to have to go home. So your never guaranteed to get ""your hours"" Even if you have been there for years and have a pretty much fixed schedule of say 38 hours a week you could get 39 one week you could get 30 the next.. . Since its fairly easy to get a job there. Your forced to put up with lazy,unreliable people and the majority people you work with lack either intellect, common sense, or both.. . Doesnt matter how hard you work or how many shifts and favors you do for them. it will never come back to you in the end.. . Management always focuses on everything you could be doing better or not doing rather then noticing what you excel at and anything extra you for the betterment of the restaurant.. . Next to no opportunity of moving up unless you plan on being there for over 10 years and even then they bring in people outside the business over promoting somebody within.. . Question i asked myself a long time ago is why bust my @$$ for a company that never plans on giving me ANYTHING in return.","Pay your good reliable employees what they deserve. Taking care of your good employees is a recipe for a successful business. Promote within. Try to show some appreciation on a weekly basis. Too much focus is constantly on whats being neglected.

I'd rather get stiffed than have some woman hand me a 2% and expect me to jump for joy do a back flip of their table.. . -CARSIDE TOGO. The way this worked at our Applebees is that servers would get scheduled like any other night but instead of getting a section they are there to answer the phone, get food together and bagged, take orders so carefully and bring the food outside to the customers car. As you can imagine, very few people tip for takeout and I usually tip at least a few bucks cause I don't want a waitress serving me for free, they aren't my slave. But I get why a lot of people don't tip take out. So on the nights I'd work on carside, I would come in at 3-4 pm and not leave until midnight.

There was no limit set and I had a table of 20 before, to myself, no help from the manager's and this table was there for more than half my shift, took up my section, was loud, drunk, demanding, and overbearing. They ran up a bill of over $400.00 in food and drinks. The kitchen was SLOW preparing the food, floor manager nor the key manager would help make this a smoother transaction. I came out that night with a $3.53 tip on that table. Was SO upset because even in the situation, I kept my composure and maintained my professionalism.

Free drinks ( I guess but read more on that below),"Where to start. Free drinks sounds great in theory, but as a host you have to always be in the front so you don't get to enjoy jack. Tried bringing drinks with me and was told this was a health hazard and trust me trying to drink enough pepsi or lemonade to last an hour in 5 seconds hurts so take free drinks as you will.. At my applebee's the only person who works harder than the host is the bartender but their advantage is that they make more and sometimes they get to be servers.. As a host ( at this applebees) you answer phones, clean bathrooms, run food,run drinks from the bar, take drink orders, bus tables, seat guests, and do any favors guests need. All while being micro managed by servers, other hosts, and managers.. MANAGERS DONT KNOW MY NAME, despite constantly reminding my manager of my name I keep getting in trouble for things another female hostess does. This means that routinely I am dragged into the managers office and scolded to near tears by managers on duty when I have done nothing wrong and told that my denial of these action is ""giving them attitude"".. And what can you expect for all this? NOT MINIMUM WAGE they have said several times that tips will make up minimum wage, and this is rarely true at my place of work, on a busy night when we reach waitlist I make 50$ for 7-8 hours of work this barely makes minimum wage on a friday night. Base pay for this region was $4.00 an hour and 2% tips ITS NOT ENOUGH.

They violate TABC rules and place their bartenders in jeopardy by refusing to address the issues of 18 year old kids coming in the place with outside alcohol and putting it in the Applebees to go cups.

I've been working for Applebee's as a line cook for a year now and although it has it's stresses the management team has been some of the best I've worked for. They are tough yet encouraging and I feel comfortable going to them if I have a problem. The crew work together well as a team and are very welcoming and accommodating to new hires. I love the fact that it's been keeping me active and helping me lose weight and unlike other companies doesn't seem to question capability of handling the job based around gender.,"Highlights. - High Stress. - Hours are difficult. - Variance comes down hard on cooks. . This job has a high volume of stress, more so than any other kitchen I've been apart of. Ticket times are the highest priority and if you can't adapt quickly to situations that get out of control this may not be the best position advised. The bad days in this position are pretty bad and if there are high variance items it's almost always the cooks fault regardless of what may be causing the issue. However, that being said it's been one of my favorite companies to work for.","Better attention to detail could be taken into training as most of the time the managers themselves don't directly work with the new hires, they work under an experienced employee of that station. However, because of this they often times have a new trainer each day and not everyone is on the same page with what is company procedure.

They promise for you to move up and be trained for promotion but never follow through. . We went through 6 managers while working there for less than a year.. . I don’t mind doing things outside of my job description but it then became expected to do things EXTREMELY outside the job description such as doing servers side duties for them (dishes, taking their food out, refilling their guests drinks, bussing their tables keep in mind my duty is to just seat customers). . They are over staffed yet somehow during shifts are always understaffed management try’s to spend as less on employees as they can which in turns brings horrible customer servers because three servers are serving the whole restaurant and one of those servers is also the bartender who has to make all specialty and alcoholic drinks for the whole restaurant.. . I found myself being a newbie training other newbies and doing it darn well but I had not been trained to train others or is it my duty that’s why they have designated trainers who are suppose to teach and observe them which they don’t cause they just said you do it.. . Management is a crucial part for things to go by smoothly and hiring good management needs to be done if not there are many scenarios where you can get push overs where the employees will do whatever the heck they want and you can get one where you get a straight up dictator who try’s restructure the whole psychology of the darn place and the employees and way things work and go and are which in turn creates a hot mess with employees to angry to do what you say.. . Servers or bartenders who have worked there for too long can get away with too much and seniority means something there and they know it so they take mean advantage and can easily steal tip money SPEAKING ON TIPS...... . Hosts only get 1 percent of all the servers tips who worked during your shift which normally I wouldn’t care because if my job went how it should have my job only entailed seating customers and maintaining cleanliness for the bathrooms and hosting area but they turned me and the word hosting into a fancy then they call “doing everything everyone else doesn’t want to do” i.e. train other employees, assist the servers in taking orders when they get too busy refilling their guests drinks, bussing their tables (which is their jobs or the buss boy which they refused to hire) refilling the ice chest, having me taken off the floor to do loads of dishes and rolling silverware in the back leaving a server to seat people at the door “if they have a chance”. My butt found my self having to direct a new hired and first time bartender how to do her job SHE AINT NEVER BARTENDED BEFORE AND THEY PUT HER AS A BARTENDER SOMEONE ASKED FOR A FIREBALL WHISKEY LEMONADE (an Applebee’s specialty alcoholic drink) AND SHE POURED A SHOT OF FIREBALL AND PUT A LEMON ON TOP OF IT ARE YOU KIDDING ME? But back to the original point 1 percent of tips when you do EVERYTHING THE SERVER JOBS ENTAILS EVERYTHING THEY HAD ME TAKING ORDERS. My tips would come out to 7 dollars, 10 dollars on nights I worked my BUTT OFF BUTT OFFFFFFFFFFF meanwhile they’re pocketing 300 and I’m confused because I may not be exceptional at math but that crap don’t add up cause the servers have potential to make some money but that goes back to what I said earlier is that bartenders can get away with a little too much and too slyly especially ones who’ve been there a long time, at the end of every servers shifts they divide the percentage that is to be split between the bartender and the host and give it to the bartender to distribute to the host but I feel that the bartender was skimping the hostesses tip money... . ..... okay rant done.
