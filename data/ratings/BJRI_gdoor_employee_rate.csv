Also, expect to be doing work well beyond what hostesses at most restaurants do. They refuse to keep enough staff working to make the restaurant run smoothly, so in order to pick up the slack we are made to clean the bathrooms, clear off tables, and wash silverware on top of seating people.

In addition, don't expect to get any hours your first few months of working. There were some weeks that I wasn't scheduled to work at all, yet the girls with seniority would work six days every week. Hostesses are also the only ones who don't get tipped; a five hour shift of working like a slave amounts to $40 before taxes are taken out.

Also, any complaint from a guest is ALWAYS your fault. Management doesn't seem to understand that servers are human and can make simple mistakes. It's always the guest's word over yours. And that sucks. The reason I got fired was because I was in the weeds and I failed to fill up a guest's water. The man claimed I ""didn't want to wait on him"" when in reality I was overwhelmed with tables because the manager cut most of the servers (to save labor cost) and I couldn't keep up with all the tasks at hand. Of course, there was no one around to help me at that time. The white shirts you wear are a pain to keep clean as well. But a lot of restaurants have that uniform so no big deal.

I started as a server but it is definitely easy to move up from host, takeout, or food runner especially if you're working at a busy location. Management is typical of corporate restaurants - you get easy going ones and ones that are nitpicky. Tips are good, depending on location some are great. I would say you make an average of $100 during night shifts, a little less during the day. Good servers get to be in the better sections that usually have booths for families. They also use Hotschedules which makes it easier to get shifts picked up and to pick up shifts. It's a big staff so usually getting shifts covered and/or getting time off isn't an issue. I should say I had a great experience at Brea and Las Vegas.","It's hard to work at some locations that don't have enough items (silverware, parmesan cheese &amp; peppers, pizza stands, etc). I've only experienced this in the San Bruno location. Makes doing you're job very difficult. Sometimes managers will copy and paste schedule so you have the same schedule for 6 weeks straight (which could be good or bad depending on what your schedule is). Besides that - just the typical server stuff, difficult clientele sometimes, zero table turnover on game days if you're working in the cocktail. Oh and there is usually a decent amount of sidework both during and after your shift so it's not a really a get in get out type of shift. Lots of pre-bussing as well because a lot of the times the bussers don't do that for you. San Bruno was my only true negative experience, great people to work with but clientele wasn't the greatest and most of management didn't help make your job easier. Kitchen staff at this location was particularly bad - felt bad for the customers as the food almost always came out wrong, cold, or just looked bad. Had to deal with this because the customer can only yell at the server, not the cooks.

The management is communicative and willing to work with your schedule. You're able to pick up shifts when you want, allowing flexibility in your weekly schedule as well. The amount of money that you make depends on your people skills, your ability to act under stress, and any other characteristics typical of a good server, which is my current position. Something that really struck me is how caring corporate is to it's employees. When hurricane Harvey hit, I was pelasantly surprised to find a nice compensation check in the mail from BJ's that was calculated by looking at how much I had worked the previous two weeks, and finding out roughly how much money I lost out on due to the days that our establishment was closed. Even though I lost next-to-nothing compared to many other unfortunate Houstonian's, this compensation was much needed and left a positive lasting impression on me from the company.","Everywhere you go you'll find some sort of issues with management, and BJ's is no different. I will say that in my time here, the cons are minimal and the biggest con for me is a personal problem, which is the commute to work. Anything else falls on minor communication issues, yet I listed their communication is still good otherwise. The only other thing that I can think of is the high-turnover rate of employees, meaning you may work with some people who aren't good at what they do, slowing you down or messing up your orders, and people who are shady, rude, or unprofessional. I feel as though this is common in many places. Lastly, shifts can be short if that's what you're looking for, but unless you're able to fill your section and stay busy for the entirety of that time, the real money is made staying on longer which isn't always an option.",Better screening process for applicants,3.126591066882666,2.923021199531266,2.9775269473256047,3.305944170771757,3.3936044978428495,3.383646097074351,2.964089519279768,2.594668592555862,3.0451631199421056
