The customers were good for the most part as well. Hotschedules makes it very easy to manage your work schedule. The uniform is great. Hostesss are able to wear black dress pants, any kind of black shirt (or white during lunch), jewelry, and hair accessories. We also get free meals and drinks.","The management at this particular restaurant was poor. In order to save money, they make hostesses work like slaves. We are constantly running around the restaurant making sure everything is taken care of, yet the managers still find something to complain about. Recently we were yelled at for losing three parties one day. The guests thought that the wait was too long and decided to eat somewhere else, so of course the managers blamed us. Also, expect to be doing work well beyond what hostesses at most restaurants do. They refuse to keep enough staff working to make the restaurant run smoothly, so in order to pick up the slack we are made to clean the bathrooms, clear off tables, and wash silverware on top of seating people. On busy days it is impossible to complete everything while trying to keep up with the large amount of guests that need to be seated. So expect to be scolded for not being able to keep up with their ridiculous demands.. . Some of my coworkers also made working here very unpleasant. Two of the girls up front are constantly rude to guests; I was always apologizing to angry customers because of them. These two are also very unorganized. Don't be surprised if they tell you to take a party to a certain table and then get mad at you for taking them there when you get back. It happened to me and other hostesses several times.. . In addition, don't expect to get any hours your first few months of working. There were some weeks that I wasn't scheduled to work at all, yet the girls with seniority would work six days every week. Hostesses are also the only ones who don't get tipped; a five hour shift of working like a slave amounts to $40 before taxes are taken out.

She said I didn't offer an appetizer or dessert and the plates were still on her table when she was ready to leave. She took two bites of her dish and asked for a box. The plates were taken off when she was done boxing up her food, but I still got points taken off. She kept me at her table for extended periods of time interfering with the quality of service for my other tables. They aren't supposed to interfere with the service.

Poor management-- managers play favorites, and are not well trained themselves. Management training program is a joke. Corporate doesn't seem to care if a location has a bad reputation and needs help to improve-- it's all about the profits they see. Responsible employees are forced to close nearly every night of the week, which would be nice if this resulted in more money at the end of the night. It didn't, and instead I had no social life. No upward mobility. Horrible break schedule, resulting in someone potentially ruining your customers' experience or you losing a table. Hard to even eat or drink while on break because of poorly-planned break system. The culture sounds nice based on what is printed on the cards employees have to carry, but it was awful working there. Forget taking vacation while working at BJ's-- I had my vacation approved two months in advance, only to be scheduled to work the entire two weeks of my vacation.

I started as a server but it is definitely easy to move up from host, takeout, or food runner especially if you're working at a busy location. Management is typical of corporate restaurants - you get easy going ones and ones that are nitpicky. Tips are good, depending on location some are great. I would say you make an average of $100 during night shifts, a little less during the day. Good servers get to be in the better sections that usually have booths for families. They also use Hotschedules which makes it easier to get shifts picked up and to pick up shifts. It's a big staff so usually getting shifts covered and/or getting time off isn't an issue. I should say I had a great experience at Brea and Las Vegas.","It's hard to work at some locations that don't have enough items (silverware, parmesan cheese &amp; peppers, pizza stands, etc). I've only experienced this in the San Bruno location. Makes doing you're job very difficult. Sometimes managers will copy and paste schedule so you have the same schedule for 6 weeks straight (which could be good or bad depending on what your schedule is). Besides that - just the typical server stuff, difficult clientele sometimes, zero table turnover on game days if you're working in the cocktail. Oh and there is usually a decent amount of sidework both during and after your shift so it's not a really a get in get out type of shift. Lots of pre-bussing as well because a lot of the times the bussers don't do that for you. San Bruno was my only true negative experience, great people to work with but clientele wasn't the greatest and most of management didn't help make your job easier. Kitchen staff at this location was particularly bad - felt bad for the customers as the food almost always came out wrong, cold, or just looked bad. Had to deal with this because the customer can only yell at the server, not the cooks.

The management is communicative and willing to work with your schedule. You're able to pick up shifts when you want, allowing flexibility in your weekly schedule as well. The amount of money that you make depends on your people skills, your ability to act under stress, and any other characteristics typical of a good server, which is my current position. Something that really struck me is how caring corporate is to it's employees. When hurricane Harvey hit, I was pelasantly surprised to find a nice compensation check in the mail from BJ's that was calculated by looking at how much I had worked the previous two weeks, and finding out roughly how much money I lost out on due to the days that our establishment was closed. Even though I lost next-to-nothing compared to many other unfortunate Houstonian's, this compensation was much needed and left a positive lasting impression on me from the company.","Everywhere you go you'll find some sort of issues with management, and BJ's is no different. I will say that in my time here, the cons are minimal and the biggest con for me is a personal problem, which is the commute to work. Anything else falls on minor communication issues, yet I listed their communication is still good otherwise. The only other thing that I can think of is the high-turnover rate of employees, meaning you may work with some people who aren't good at what they do, slowing you down or messing up your orders, and people who are shady, rude, or unprofessional. I feel as though this is common in many places. Lastly, shifts can be short if that's what you're looking for, but unless you're able to fill your section and stay busy for the entirety of that time, the real money is made staying on longer which isn't always an option.",Better screening process for applicants,3.126591066882666,2.923021199531266,2.9775269473256047,3.305944170771757,3.3936044978428495,3.383646097074351,2.964089519279768,2.594668592555862,3.0451631199421056,"""Bjs restaurant""",3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2017-07-09,Current,Assistant General Manager,Eugene,Yes,Neutral,Neutral,Full-time,More than 8 years,Company with a lot of heart and room for growth from internals to management.
