Also if they need one of their shifts housed it's not a problem and managers don't ask for anything in return, but when a newer staff member needs help with a shift managers won't do anything unless that staff member does something for them (i.e. picking up a standby/breaker shift/coming in on their day off).

Someone complains they didn't like something (but for example ate all the shrimp in it, don't comp that meal). Only comp for actual issues (burnt, undercooked, something was in the dish, food quality). We've become the place that scam artists love to come to because they know they can get something for free if they complain. I've seen people eat almost an entire dish, say they just didn't like it and get it for free. Are you kidding me? Also figure out the fries situation and always have runner friendly food.

Instead the company should simply pay the buses and bartenders and food runners more.. . On the topic of sexual harassment. I got pretty much attacked in the store, and management, pretty much refused to take action. I then noticed how the attitude shifted against me, treating me terribly and docking my hours.

People also love the culture, The Cheesecake Factory champions treating their hourly staff the way they should be treated--with respect! Managers are extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling, there are great opportunities for advancement, and servers, bussers, line cooks, kitchen managers and restaurant managers are friendly and promote a fun and safe working environment. This was easily the best company I have ever worked for in the restaurant industry, and I have been doing this for over 9 years. The opportunity for advancement is second-to-none. As a matter of fact, we, as managers were expected to be constantly training ourselves for promotions. I never heard of any manager that had worked for the company for multiple years that was not promoted. They encourage you to learn as much as you can about the food, culture, and systems. Staff are allowed free soup and bread (something you won't always find at other chains) and there's a meal program that takes a small amount of money out of your paycheck each day that you work and allows you to order most of the items on the menu (because just about everyone would take advantage of ordering the high priced items like the filet mignon or the ribeye). I will sorely miss the people, the managers, and the general attitude of every person I worked with, met, and became friends with while I was employed. Cheesecake Rocks!","The fast pace can be too much for some people and the hours can be long and arduous. As an example, I, as a kitchen manager, worked around 11-14 hours a day and it was exhausting. It was difficult to find the right work/life balance and ultimately I chose life over work. A lot of people in management, because of the long hours and having to work sometimes at home, reported their relationships with their significant other deteriorated and/or ended. While I was there, one of the kitchen managers was going through a rough divorce and a restaurant manager told me about how his wife divorced him because he became a workaholic and he ultimately had to step down as his role as the general manager and was demoted.",The benefits package that came with my salary were great. Bonuses were based on the overall performance of all the managers.

Like a lot of restaurants, who you work with can either make your shift amazing or a nightmare, especially with the managers. Hard work is not appropriately recognized, and even if you work hard and give it 110%, most of the time the managers do not acknowledge it or reward you. The bussers are consistently overstaffed, which means you make less money and have a lot of dead time. Because of this, the managers will make you look busy instead of scheduling the right number of people. The dish crew is always running behind, and the managers will make you rack and run your own silverware if they get really behind. Also, when you work a double or help a manger, you'll get a green ticket which you use to get free food. The problem with this is that people who are friends with the managers will get green tickets without even doing anything. Finally, if you wish to move up in the company, you have to have a very flexible schedule. They hold classes for servers/bartenders once every 3-6 months.

Scheduling is a mess - there's absolutely no way you shouldn't be able to make a schedule for a 2 week period rather than just one released on Friday. I shouldn't have to wait until Friday to know if I'm free the following Friday - employees have lives too and they'd like to be able to plan their time. It's obviously management's laziness, and since there are 7 managers at any given time there's no way one can't take the extra time to just set the schedule. If you don't care about your employees time and work/life balance then don't pretend to care about your employees at all. Good luck requesting off ever - it won't happen.. . In terms of why it is awful to be a server - most of the ""extra steps of service"" are asinine and actually take away from the customer's experience because if a customer wants a straw they shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes for their server to get it for them because they have to consolidate steps and have to get a bev nap to present the straw to the customer because god forbid you just have wrapped straws in your apron and you can't automatically give them a straw even though every customer wants one.

My management personally tried their hardest to accommodate everyone's preference on a schedule. They also use Hotschedules, an online and interactive scheduling module that allows you to view your schedule, request days off, and switch shifts with a coworker per management's approval. I also made great money working at CF. The high table turn time and moderately sized section helped this. CF does not take reservations, but sits guests on a first come first serve basis to make sure your section is never being wasted. The majority of CFs are located at a mall where the flow of drive-bys and walk-ins is ever constant. CF is very good about promoting internally as well. Although this is an opportunity not presented to myself in my time there, many servers/bakery workers have been promoted to management.","A very large restaurant comes with the cons of just that....large sections. Diverse clientele. Minimal attention from management as they are usually running around with more work than one can handle. You are also working with a very large staff that you must interact and learn how to work with a lot of coworkers. You are also working on other peoples time. When it is busy, shift change can take up to an hour and checking out can take up to an hour as you must wait on a shift lead to check out your side work. Holidays are pure madness, and CF is open 365 days a year. Good luck getting the holidays off!

While I was being overloaded with salads/sandwiches, the two guys in pizza stood there helplessly with nothing on their screen. While they couldn't do anything to help, the idea of hiring two people to pizza instead of an extra to salad/sandwiches was an incompetent thing to do, and it only added to the stress of working inside a hot, nasty kitchen.. . Working in the salad station was/is a trap, and I see why hardly anyone lasts in that station without either transferring or quitting completely. Salad/Sandwiches must remember all the ingredients for EVERY salad. Sounds easy until you see that there are far too many salads to remember by heart. Management would not allow you to move on to another station unless you remember salads that not even the management knows.

High stress was to be expected, but hardly getting help (being a female worker) was ridiculous. I had to operate both salad/sandwiches when both screens were packed full of orders, and the management expected me to literally do all of those things at once.

I wanted a clerical position, but I soon found out that moving to that position wasn't going to happen since the salad/sandwiches position is a TRAP.. .

Lastly and most importantly because it was the main reason why I decided to leave was the fact that there was no love here. recipes were too corporate and sad. we didn't hand cut many things and there was no passion. The key to why I chose this profession was because I saw others passion and love. There were no high stakes.
