It seems that no matter how hard you work toward the ""Cheesecake Mission"" or how little you contribute, it doesn't make a difference. If you are on a mgr's good list and kiss a lot butt, you can pretty much get anything you want, and by all means don't make any waves - you'll end up a second rate number. The worst thing they did to us was take away our smoking privileges! The CCF became a multi-billion dollar company after 30 years with servers who smoked and when you walk by a fine dining restaurant and see that their employees can go out for a smoke and we can't it kinda makes you mad. After a busy 4 hours waiting on rude foreigners, a smoke would certainly be nice for the ones who have the habbit- instead you get a progressively more irritated server! Speaking of foreiners,, there is NO policy against auto-grats and we should be allowed to do it at locations that suffer the low or no tips from Europeans, Canadians and others who just don't wanna tip.....The company as a whole is aware of the problem yet refuses to do anything about it , to me that demonstrates they only care about their bank accounts and as long as the check total is paid.......One more thing......why for such a HUGE company am I having to pay $100 or more a month for health insurance ?","Stop the favoritism!! We are not in 4th grade folks!! If we were I'd be sure to bring an apple to work with me sometimes. Give back our smoking priviledges!!! If you are a smoker, it relieves stress when u have one in stressful situations. If you are not allowed, the stress only builds. If you're not a smoker then stop trying to regulate my rights as a smoker in not in California for Pete sake! I'm a big girl I can figure out a good time to slip one in without hurting anybody- we've done it for years that way. Don't forget us career servers when you're rolling out sections, just because I'm not one of your pets or not as cute and pretty as someone else, I've put in a LOT of my life to this company and would LOVE some real appreciation for it---- otherwise , what's the point?

This company DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. They recently changed their seating to policy to 'preferred seating 1st' meaning the booths get sat first, so if you have a section that is all table (by the way sections are never bigger than 4 tables) your only hope of getting sat is if every booth is full, also the bar seating has been taking out of the rotation all together. A few people will make all the money the rest will be stuck with a few tables all night.. . You will have a food run shift and/or a stand by shift every week, meaning you will have a shift you may or may not be used on and/or a shift where you are just running food and making very little every week.. .

During slow season you may be sent home after about 4 or 5 hours of work. There are some people who understand the stress and can cooperate by being a part of the solution, then there are those who become a part of the problem.","If you didn't get sent home early during the slow season you are being left alone to do the job of two people which can be stressful and happens quite often, so you are more or less lucky if you didn't get stuck by yourself. They start you off with a decent pay but you will rarely see any increase unless you can really impress somebody. During peak periods you will have managers who expect for you to go ""above and beyond your work of line"" but can also backfire if you fall behind on your main task and then you give everyone a reason to blame you. A lot of times the company would have new items on the menu and requires the company to order new ingredients everyday but if the item is not available, you cant sell the item and becomes an issue with everybody until it gets resolved which can last of up to an hour at times. A lot of the Expo are unreasonable at times and like to yell instead of being of some help.",Really practice what you are teaching and not just tell the employees to follow rules because the rule book says so. I was happy to hear the company does things by the book and upset to realize that is a lie. You cant expect the employees to go by the book if they see some one with experience do something the book is against.,3.14671293618662,3.14671293618662,3.14671293618662,3.0508771929824565,2.8139695712309827,3.1793004523888326,2.942612867967172,2.805935329251624,2.7779834200886837,"""Hard work, but great rewards""",5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2013-01-17,Past,Manager,San Jose,Yes,Yes,Yes,Full-time,More than 5 years,I had started as a server and moved quickly to a management role.

Won't let you work doubles, because it affects management bonuses at the end of the year. Breaker shifts and standby shifts, come on we are definitely in the minority here on these types of shifts. Also there should be designated food runners, who only have food run shifts and designated servers who only serve, no in between. When they need something they expect you to do it right away, when you need support (i.e. getting something comped, talking to a guest) some of the managers don't help. There is also a lot of favoritism for people who have been there longer, even though some of them are constantly in the weeds/having meltdowns. They get better sections, even though they aren't the best with guests or act like team players. Also if they need one of their shifts housed it's not a problem and managers don't ask for anything in return, but when a newer staff member needs help with a shift managers won't do anything unless that staff member does something for them (i.e. picking up a standby/breaker shift/coming in on their day off). The more you take care of your employees and respect them, the happier they will be and the happier the guest will be.","Take care of your employees, we're your greatest resource. But by taking away gratuity and not figuring out a solution that would allow us to keep it, you have shown us that we're not worth it. We also need to be more conservative with our comps. Someone complains they didn't like something (but for example ate all the shrimp in it, don't comp that meal). Only comp for actual issues (burnt, undercooked, something was in the dish, food quality). We've become the place that scam artists love to come to because they know they can get something for free if they complain. I've seen people eat almost an entire dish, say they just didn't like it and get it for free. Are you kidding me? Also figure out the fries situation and always have runner friendly food. We shouldn't have to call for fries, the kitchen should be constantly be cooking new batches (especially on a busy night) and should plate them and then bump the item on the screen as ready to be run. Not bump the item and then make the fries so the person running the food waits for 3/4 min (which feels like 3/4hrs) and their guests are wondering where they are.

They made you excited to come to work.","I had been told the clientele had gone downhill. The most you can look forward to ever making is on New Years Eve, in which 400-600 (VERY RARE, ONE TIME OCCURRENCE I WAS TOLD) can happen. HA! No way! I'm sorry, making on average 100-200 dollars a night or more commonly on a double, being the most you make? NO ONE can live off that. I know tipping is not up to the company, but if the workers are being treated so poorly, do something.. . Just because a server has been there for however many years, does NOT give you the right to micro manage, or butt into a conversation or problem that does not concern you. (I had been dealing with hard financial problems, and this server had the audacity to step in my way and disrespect me horribly, telling me how to give out more money to my coworkers, (on the night I nearly did everything on my own, all while I was fighting from becoming homeless, which I in turn did.) You are NOT a manager. So dont act like you are. Managers need to discipline or call out workers who try to talk down to others or act like they have authority over them.. . Tipshare is RIDICULOUS! I at times would have to tip out a total of 40-60 dollars, making me walk with 30-50.... even on doubles because of how cheap, disrespectful and selfish this location has become! I'm sorry but if you are relying on tips, become a server. It is NOT our responsibility to make sure we give you a certain percentage a night, especially when at times we are the ones still bussing our tables (Happens so much) , run all our food (very rare) or waiting on drinks while you flirt or do whatever with guests (rare but does happen) To demand I give MORE of MY guests tipped money because you chose a less common tipped position, is NOT the servers responsibility. Instead the company should simply pay the buses and bartenders and food runners more.. . On the topic of sexual harassment. I got pretty much attacked in the store, and management, pretty much refused to take action. I then noticed how the attitude shifted against me, treating me terribly and docking my hours. (Honestly dont know why I didn't go to court at this time.) Then it happened AGAIN, this time by a MANAGER! At that point I was fed up. If I had complained again, how much worse would they have treated me? This place is a nightmare, and a disrespectful joke.","(To corporate) Fire everyone and start new management. I'm sorry but all management is either sexually harassing others or simply disrespect, and treat them like dirt, while playing favorites with those who have been there for years yet do the bare minimum.

The store has an awesome staff, and I met many great friends. Great serving job to do while pursuing other passions. Also, Cheesecake Factory has a rigorous training program while hard at first, it will grant you many future opportunities in the service industry. Cheesecake servers know what they're doing. I never found any issues with the managements, because I followed protocol and was respectful in the workplace. My work ethic was rewarded with compliments, good serving sections, and a prime schedule. The GM is a former football player and treats the restaurant like a sports team. I don't think that's a bad thing, actually. Play your part and you'll see results.","The seasonal aspect of the location makes it hard to predict business. Some days were completely dead, and I'd walk out after only having 3 tables (September-October). Other times, you could be short staffed during shift change and end up running around like crazy. Also, the guests can be a little nuts and unpredictable, but that's South Florida for you.. . I know it's like this in a lot of restaurants, but the cook line was ridiculously disorganized and cared nothing for anyone on the other side of the window. They don't cooperate with servers or managers and are just there to get a paycheck, rarely worrying about the food quality, presentation, or timing.

This was easily the best company I have ever worked for in the restaurant industry, and I have been doing this for over 9 years. The opportunity for advancement is second-to-none. As a matter of fact, we, as managers were expected to be constantly training ourselves for promotions. I never heard of any manager that had worked for the company for multiple years that was not promoted. They encourage you to learn as much as you can about the food, culture, and systems. Staff are allowed free soup and bread (something you won't always find at other chains) and there's a meal program that takes a small amount of money out of your paycheck each day that you work and allows you to order most of the items on the menu (because just about everyone would take advantage of ordering the high priced items like the filet mignon or the ribeye).

Scheduling is a mess - there's absolutely no way you shouldn't be able to make a schedule for a 2 week period rather than just one released on Friday. I shouldn't have to wait until Friday to know if I'm free the following Friday - employees have lives too and they'd like to be able to plan their time. It's obviously management's laziness, and since there are 7 managers at any given time there's no way one can't take the extra time to just set the schedule. If you don't care about your employees time and work/life balance then don't pretend to care about your employees at all. Good luck requesting off ever - it won't happen.. . In terms of why it is awful to be a server - most of the ""extra steps of service"" are asinine and actually take away from the customer's experience because if a customer wants a straw they shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes for their server to get it for them because they have to consolidate steps and have to get a bev nap to present the straw to the customer because god forbid you just have wrapped straws in your apron and you can't automatically give them a straw even though every customer wants one. It's a restaurant and yet they don't understand the basic wants and needs of the average customer.",Do everything differently.,3.031617505301716,3.311920798095914,3.311920798095914,3.693621149648314,3.225790248610417,3.69217444097157,3.4031517633201447,3.3079932678461743,3.143738822419395,"""Best in the Industry""",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2015-09-20,Current,Restaurant Manager,North Atlanta,Neutral,Yes,Yes,Full-time,More than 5 years,Fortune 100 Best Places to work.

Latest new system made it easier for salad/sandwiches coworkers (no more randomly asking for W/salad...but they still asked for them anyway even with the new system in place).","Incompetent managers making stupid decisions such as this: Management foolishly hired two new people to pizza; thus, leaving me to fend for myself. While I was being overloaded with salads/sandwiches, the two guys in pizza stood there helplessly with nothing on their screen. While they couldn't do anything to help, the idea of hiring two people to pizza instead of an extra to salad/sandwiches was an incompetent thing to do, and it only added to the stress of working inside a hot, nasty kitchen.. . Working in the salad station was/is a trap, and I see why hardly anyone lasts in that station without either transferring or quitting completely. Salad/Sandwiches must remember all the ingredients for EVERY salad. Sounds easy until you see that there are far too many salads to remember by heart. Management would not allow you to move on to another station unless you remember salads that not even the management knows. It was simply their way of keeping a coworker confined to salad/sandwiches...and now I see why other coworkers avoided working over there.. .. . High stress was to be expected, but hardly getting help (being a female worker) was ridiculous. I had to operate both salad/sandwiches when both screens were packed full of orders, and the management expected me to literally do all of those things at once. When overwhelmed with work, I was told that it was my fault for not being organized. Yeah, excuse me for not having four extra arms.. . I wanted a clerical position, but I soon found out that moving to that position wasn't going to happen since the salad/sandwiches position is a TRAP.. . Management regularly allowed orders pass the closing hour, even after the kitchen closed.. . At certain locations, management made up rules---basically trying to flex their managerial muscles on coworkers who they felt they could.. . Many other male coworkers (when frustrated) would throw serious fits of rage, (slamming things, bouts of swear words etc), but those same coworkers seemed to have kept their jobs....coworkers who worked there for YEARS. When I became angry, I was written up twice and threatened with suspension---which ultimately left ended with a subtle ""you're fired"".. . Servers were at times more annoying than guests with asking for salads before they would even appear on the screen, and often getting orders wrong which resulted in me stopping my rush flow to make side salads....yet they wondered why salads were coming out late most of the time.","Particularly at the North Star Mall location:. . You take the sides of your incompetent managers before you would your coworkers, and then you wonder why salad/sandwiches is always looking for workers.

If you're not going fast enough they will put someone who's been there for a long time to finish and send you home. they'll ask someone to help you when they're finished making them eventually dislike you because they have to stay longer. When you're suppose to take your break, no one really goes because they're trying to finish fast. which leaves you to be the oddball bc you want to sit down. I never took my break besides when I was training.. Lastly and most importantly because it was the main reason why I decided to leave was the fact that there was no love here. recipes were too corporate and sad. we didn't hand cut many things and there was no passion. The key to why I chose this profession was because I saw others passion and love. There were no high stakes. No make it or break it, as you would see in a restaurant owned by a chef or a mom and pop. if you honestly could care less about that then I highly recommend this job.","You say you send us home early because its slow and you're losing money but the cheesecake factory is a huge corporation and I have a hard time believing that they can't pay for us to work our scheduled hours. I also don't understand why you force others to help us. you're basically making our coworkers slowly dislike us. So my advice to you is instead of sending someone home (especially if they're new) have them work alongside the faster person so they can note some tips they have and slowly mimic them in order to gain speed.

This job will teach you the ins and outs of how restaurants operate and the longer you stay, the more responsibility you will be given.. -understanding coworkers and managers, who are always willing to listen to any problems you might have. -ample amount of breaks throughout your shift if you ask. -free soup, bread, and drinks. -50% of meals, and free meals if you work a double or are rewarded for hard work. -ability to work very few hours, or pick up shifts and work many hours. -ability to move up in the company, but it will take years so stick with it. - you have the ability to earn tips","-consistently stressful, loud, and crowded. -fast paced. -some guests were very rude to the staff. -kind of feels like high school, some staff and guests just won't like you no matter how hard you try.. -always on your feet. -never affected me, but I saw some hostess ostracize one another and it felt cliquy. -the work gets pretty physical and can definitely do damage if you're a hard worker. -if you're a hard worker, you might be moved linearly in the company rather than further up in position..sure you'll get more experience in a different area but you'll have to work harder for a very small raise (about .50 each raise)","#1 advice: love each other and be on each other's side. Be more holistic in your expectations of your employees, and play by the same rule book. If something isn't allowed, then all of the managers should be on board about enforcing it. Try and make more time for team meetings or one on one reviews. The team meetings always helped remind workers of what they should and shouldn't be doing. I loved the Tigard management team and respect the amount of work they do to please all of rude guests and whiny pregnant hostesses they have to put up with (;",3.472334682860998,3.320782903732214,3.295661060854433,3.7736114479747753,3.5328753888468993,3.9469268881271935,3.474889492355066,3.302040405865424,3.4117139712094846,"""Manager""",3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2017-05-03,Past,Manager,San Antonio,No,Yes,Yes,Full-time,More than 10 years,Plenty of opportunity for growth,Talk down to employees and treat them as tools,Remember the people are your greatest resources,3.8333333333333335,3.5384615384615383,3.508241758241758,4.161538461538462,3.0384615384615383,4.523076923076923,4.4230769230769225,4.169230769230769,3.715384615384615,1.0,3.88936982655149,3.285668463654219,4.235001905602058,3.9489832077159943,3.735635587548096,3.56354929329705

The atmosphere is fun, extremely fast paced, and mature. The staff will help you move forward and will take time to help you develop personally or professionally.

If you're afraid of being harassed for a mistake, it won't make you afraid of making the mistake, but of the person.. . For someone just starting out in the industry, it's well worth starting out here. With a 200+ item menu and standardized restaurant operation, it's probably one of the best places in the United States to begin working at right out of culinary school to get a good look at your textbooks at work. You will meet life-long mentors and make good friends. Just be sure to brush up on your spanish if you're on the coast.","It's sometimes difficult to hold a second job because of schedule requirements, requirements that nearly each other restaurant simultaneously requests. The Cheesecake Factory typically opens in areas that require a higher income to live within a reasonable range of work. This means that sometimes even staff without dependents can have a difficulty sustaining a necessary second job to maintain their residency. Excluding overnight jobs of course. For staff with dependents, a second job is an absolute necessity.. . As with any restaurant job, maintaining a family life will be difficult.","When staff offer information, listen.

The staff are very forgiving of mistakes, which makes learning your job much easier. If you're afraid of being harassed for a mistake, it won't make you afraid of making the mistake, but of the person.. . For someone just starting out in the industry, it's well worth starting out here. With a 200+ item menu and standardized restaurant operation, it's probably one of the best places in the United States to begin working at right out of culinary school to get a good look at your textbooks at work. You will meet life-long mentors and make good friends. Just be sure to brush up on your spanish if you're on the coast.","It's sometimes difficult to hold a second job because of schedule requirements, requirements that nearly each other restaurant simultaneously requests. The Cheesecake Factory typically opens in areas that require a higher income to live within a reasonable range of work. This means that sometimes even staff without dependents can have a difficulty sustaining a necessary second job to maintain their residency. Excluding overnight jobs of course. For staff with dependents, a second job is an absolute necessity.. . As with any restaurant job, maintaining a family life will be difficult.","When staff offer information, listen.
