Chili's brand has certainly gone down in recent years and has even been realized as a joke place in movies. As a company that used to compete well in the casual dining market, to date, they seem to rely on price points, round numbers, as well as cutting the fat to save every cent possible. You almost feel embarrassed saying you work here and you can thank the 2 for $20 for the run down decor and equipment of the restaurant. I doubt Chili's will be in business by the time inflation hits food prices hard. It's a shame they look so broke but they have to save every cent to make any money at all off their flagship product. The 2 for $20 will be the number one thing you sell by the way, and it will make your blood boil serving it to people who don't understand proper restaurant etiquette. Your clientele will consist of people who are extreme cheapskates and will be so rude because they don't get to go out often and take the opportunity to demand what they want. Customers also know that managers will do whatever the customer wants. I had a lady once ask for a discount, so when I asked if there was a problem she simply replied ""because the customer is always right"" so my manager discounted her 10 percent off. Your tips average 8-10% due to the higher end clientele going to better establishments. Your kitchen is also extremely incompetent and they base scheduling in the slow season off of your GEM score. (Basically a guest review of their experience) so if they had a problem with their food out of your control and admit that, you in turn will be blamed because it came up as a problem under your name, which isn't fair because it may not be your problem in the first place i.e kitchen mistake or food tasted bad.","I have no advice to senior management at all, I just have hope.

The turnover rate for managers was high, and as a server it definitely kept you on your toes -- and not in a good way. Some of the managers developed negative attitudes towards working there (the second they started their shift you could tell they did not want to be there) and were insanely incompetent; many of them did not understand the idea of leaving their personal life behind prior to coming into work and displayed clear favoritism towards particular employees. I experienced several instances of sexual harassment on part of the kitchen staff, and even after bringing it up to a manager, said manager did nothing to remedy the situation or even attempt to inform the GM (I did not feel comfortable discussing the situation personally with the GM). From what I understand now after speaking to former coworkers at the location, it appears that management is being cleaned up by the regional director (who, by the way, is actually fantastic at his job and probably the only superior I miss), so hopefully things will improve in the future.","Learn how to give clear direction and provide equal expectations (regardless of favoritism and/or personal relationships) to ALL employees. Take your job more seriously, and understand that subordinates will learn from your example. If you display a poor work ethic, you can expect your staff to lack any respect for you and your position, and the restaurant will continue to function in absolute chaos.

It depends on who's working in the kitchen to how your food comes out, if we had the wrong staff in the kitchen, my food would come out all messed up then I would look bad because 2 out of the 3 people sitting at my table's food came out incorrectly.. Too much running sidework, it wouldn't be such a big deal if we didn't have so many lazy people working because we don't schedule people based on the amount of side work they do, we schedule them based on their scores so the people with the highest scores get to stand around on their phone and not worry about side work or running food so it's always the same 3 people doing side work and running food and they never get called out for not doing anything because their ziosk scores are high, it's really ridiculous. And the people who are doing everything don't get noticed for it because their scores aren't high enough and their scores won't go up because their too busy doing all the side work for the people who's scores are high so it's just a ridiculous pattern.. And the hosts, not to mention the hosts... They don't check on the servers because they don't care if we're weeded, we have 6 table sections so if you get 6 tables at once, it's almost impossible to greet and make drinks for 6 tables at once so you pretty much just break down. And the managers don't say anything about the hosts doing this to us because as long as there's not a wait at the door, that's all that matters, it doesn't matter if they get horrible service or if their food takes 30-45 minutes to come out, as long as they're not standing at the door waiting, that's all that matters. Most of the time, the managers are helping the hosts sit us 6 times in a row then wonder why we're drowning.. We're a team based restaurant so we have a partner in the floor which is sometimes good but most of the time bad because if you have a partner like me who works hard, it gives you as my partner an excuse to go stare at the kitchen for your food and ask me to do a bunch of stuff for your tables or for you to go to the bathroom or smoke while I watch your tables.. We close an hour later than any other restaurant so the last hour, we get crapped on.. We also do a bunch of cheap cheap deals so we get all the bad tips. The average check is 20$ so 15% of 20$ does not add up to much at the end of the night, you wind up doing more work for less money so a 6 table section doesn't really make a difference.. The 3 managers that I talked about in the pros were awesome but there was one who constantly yelled at us and talked disrespectful to the people he didn't wanna screw or didn't hang out with. He was also the one that made the schedule so only his favorites got a good schedule, like this one girl who wasn't even a very good server and I constantly had to cover her butt because she couldn't handle more than 2 tables but because he wanted to screw her she got the schedule she wanted. I heard him constantly talk about screwing her. There was one time every body could hear this particular manager yelling all the way at the front of the restaurant at an employee, it was really unprofessional and he doesn't deserve to be a manager.","Pay better attention to your servers who are doing all the side work, stop only paying attention to a score that doesn't make any difference. The score has nothing to do with your server, it's not based on attentivness, it's based on whether or not they wanna return to a restaurant that may or may not have been dirty or a restaurant that their food might have taken 40 minutes or maybe their food was sent out with something their server 86'd but because I didn't run their food, I didnt see that it had something it wasn't suppose to on it or they had a kid in the next booth screaming in their ears or base it on the fact that they couldn't get sat in a booth instead of a table or that the bartender took a year and a day to make their drinks or maybe the host just sat me with 5 other tables and I really just couldn't control the service I have them.. Not everything is based off of a score that doesn't mean anything about my serving ability. Pay more attention to who actually cares and who actually is a good server but is just stuck covering everybody else's butts and doing the work for them. Pay better attention to what is really going on and not just what YOU wanna think is going on because 9 times out of 10, you're wrong.",3.093466895938883,2.962913772271971,2.992918070766646,3.4660654219275577,3.2911943382300377,3.498938332105128,3.243276773754819,3.0694672433961854,3.041245646472118

There is a lack of respect for tenure and it actually tends to harm a lot of middle management because they will find a reason to replace you if you are making too much money. The company has a lack of understanding of the communities it serves and holds all restaurants to the same goals in turnover regardless of the workforce available to the area. Retaliation often occurs in this company keeping its employees to present their true problems and feelings. Assistant managers are in and out of the stores almost as much as the hourly employees because the training program is not holding everyone to the same level of accountability causing the stores to be short staffed so much so that everyone is expected to travel to guest manage at stores that are up to 80 miles from their home.","Follow your Inverted Pyramid, Don't be naive to think that your Regional Managers are all doing their jobs with the morals and ethics that The person who started this once great company expects of his employees.
