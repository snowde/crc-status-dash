During my 60 hour work weeks, I spend 90% of that cooking or prepping and I'm not the only manager in my area that deals with this frustration. You brag about hiring talented leaders...use them to LEAD and coach. We are stuck in function ALL day.. . There are also some locations that are still making lots of money for the company (mine) and we are still getting yelled at for BRGs and guest satisfaction scores. If a location is up double digits and beating their labor percentage...realize that THESE factors affect the bottom line...and thank me for your inflated bonuses.. . Our culture used to be what stood us apart...that is no longer true. We haven't heard anything/preached anything in 2 years.. . Start promoting the managers you say you will, follow through on promises, get the prep tool fixed (always a bug) and realize that MenuLink is not a cure-all.",2.930352794543629,2.930352794543629,2.930352794543629,3.2739726027397262,3.1716247392182613,3.164172983996099,2.800816778028559,3.031580134167653,2.930352794543629,"""Ahead of the pack""",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2013-10-16,Current,General Manager,np.nan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Full-time,More than 8 years,Making changes to become the best in their segment of the industry,Lots of micro management on business plans and rules,Become a partner with your GMP's,3.3323972666853883,3.3323972666853883,3.3323972666853883,3.1111111111111107,2.6666666666666665,3.444444444444445,3.0,3.444444444444445,3.3323972666853883,1.0,3.220241629149201,2.9191457029424637,3.304308714220272,2.9004083890142796,3.238012289306049,3.1313750306145085

Let go without actually being told!!!!. . I was hired with little history of working in the restaurant industry.

The interview contained a lot about how working there is like family but it turns out that this family is using and cheating on one another.. My trainers I worked alongside for the entire shifts did either not share the tip jar with me or only gave me less then a 1/4 of what we both accumulated. So much about equal sharing for equal work.. . After training period was over the different on duty managers as well as franchise owner and scheduling manager told me different ways on how to communicate my availability in order to be scheduled for regular shifts.. I ended up not being scheduled for literally weeks as I followed anyones rules on how to make that clear when I could work but it seemed that none was the right way.. When I stopped by in the almost empty restuarants during the day here and there I was just shoved out of the way by management on duty - had no time to talk.. . I finally got the whole run down by scheduling manager and called her as requested before a deadline just to be not scheduled again.. .

If you are going to terminate managers over MEE Surveys, then put more security in place so they are more accurate. There is cheating both ways on these surveys. Disgruntled team members filling out multiples and unethical managers filling out multiple positive ones. Try to not contradict yourselves with the massive amounts of changes. Offer better health insurance and benefits. Change the bonus structure. Take it easy on the budgets and goals that are needed to succeed. Many goals are close to impossible to hit which is requiring the managers to be labor savers and not properly lead and also the restaurants not being staffed properly which is leading to poor guest service and restaurants not being cleaned properly. Many of your restaurants are profiting and making the company money, yet the managers are still not bonusing.",3.1220182109842938,3.1220182109842938,3.1220182109842938,3.452054794520548,3.21272062962922,3.38335106618788,3.1304833627567095,3.2382546930492127,3.1220182109842938,"""Manager""",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2014-01-29,Past,Manager,Houston,No,No,Neutral,Full-time,Less than a year,Fun environment and great team work,structure is a little lacking.,create more structure throughout the brand.,3.1092389778152207,3.1092389778152207,3.1092389778152207,2.8888888888888884,2.6666666666666665,2.8888888888888884,3.1111111111111107,3.3381801554641064,3.1092389778152203,1.0,3.226275287996514,2.9396936481479434,3.1361199775383843,3.1207972369339103,3.2882174242566595,3.115628594399757

Chili's brand has certainly gone down in recent years and has even been realized as a joke place in movies. As a company that used to compete well in the casual dining market, to date, they seem to rely on price points, round numbers, as well as cutting the fat to save every cent possible. You almost feel embarrassed saying you work here and you can thank the 2 for $20 for the run down decor and equipment of the restaurant. I doubt Chili's will be in business by the time inflation hits food prices hard. It's a shame they look so broke but they have to save every cent to make any money at all off their flagship product. The 2 for $20 will be the number one thing you sell by the way, and it will make your blood boil serving it to people who don't understand proper restaurant etiquette. Your clientele will consist of people who are extreme cheapskates and will be so rude because they don't get to go out often and take the opportunity to demand what they want. Customers also know that managers will do whatever the customer wants. I had a lady once ask for a discount, so when I asked if there was a problem she simply replied ""because the customer is always right"" so my manager discounted her 10 percent off. Your tips average 8-10% due to the higher end clientele going to better establishments. Your kitchen is also extremely incompetent and they base scheduling in the slow season off of your GEM score. (Basically a guest review of their experience) so if they had a problem with their food out of your control and admit that, you in turn will be blamed because it came up as a problem under your name, which isn't fair because it may not be your problem in the first place i.e kitchen mistake or food tasted bad.","I have no advice to senior management at all, I just have hope.

There are small incentive programs that make work more fun, and the service staff is comprised of very awesome people. I would recommend this job to someone that has previous hospitality experience.","Poor training. New hires with minimal to no hospitality experience never made it longer than two months. The training program appears to have been designed thoughtfully with a fun and humorous tone to help new hires, but becomes complex and confusing, making it difficult for new hires to grasp, especially when it is administered by unconcerned servers/ bartenders that want to rush through the steps and get back to their jobs. Also, the menu is constantly changing, constantly making the older menus and training guides outdated. This makes it confusing for a new hire who is learning about old sandwiches that are not on the menu anymore, instead of learning about the new ones that are. Management seems to be more involved with checking on tables for negativity to throw at the employees, than spending time with them engaging, encouraging, teaching, training, and developing. Also, management is quick to let employees go without necessary documentation (i.e. counseling, written notices, suspension, etc.) which may hurt one day when you find an employee intelligent and determined enough to seek legal advice about being improperly terminated after one year of employment without any prior counseling.","Become more involved with your staff and ensure that training is completely understood by new hires, and everyone is in sync with current menu items and promotions, without being too critical if they don't know everything on the second day.

Can make decent money if the store you work at is high volume.,"The amount of side work that is done on $3.10 an hour is ridiculous, also the case with opening shifts. At that time no tips are being made so pay should be minimum wage. It is not fair to make employees do extra work while getting paid next to nothing (sometimes takes more than an hour or two). Like any serving job dealing with the public is hard and you must be a people person. In addition, I feel like pushing the customers to use the Ziosks should not be such a big deal. Yes, it can be convenient if the customer is in a rush and makes the customers feel safe as their card never has to leave the table, however, a lot of people simply want to enjoy their experience out and do not want to cash themselves out. This should not reflect on the server. I once had a table tip me 50% because I did not make them cash out on the ziosk. They told me to tell management that it takes away from the experience. The surveys at the end are also ridiculous because people will not tell you that they had a problem and then say it in the survey. How is that solving anything? Especially if the problem was with the food. I cannot fix the problem if I do not know about it until the next day.. . There is also a lot of favoritism and not enough professionalism. If you work hard you and do well you should get recognized/rewarded. I also felt there was no opportunity to grow in this company as they were always hiring from outside rather than from within. The menu is constantly changing and is pretty large also. Customers get mad when something leaves (cinnamon apples and Caesar salads). There are long hours and no breaks.

Chili's uses a team service method, which is also convenient ( two people basically take care of a larger amount of tables rather than just having your own set tables). Because of team service, the sections are larger because they assume two people are going to be stopping by and helping each table. if you're partnered with a weak server, team service falls through, because all of a sudden you're taking care of your own tables in addition to all of theirs.

The Ziosk that sit on the table is basically a flashing light to parents to bring all 10 of their kids to Chili's and I'm running around like crazy for a bill that is barely $50, and I may only get a 10% tip. Cheap people. It's so bad, and please don't be offended if you go to Chili's to eat and you're reading this, because obviously not everyone that comes in is cheap.

Told it was part of my ""job responsibilities."". . Chili's itself is an amazing company. I never got to see benefits and getting my shift meals where always hard. Older workers would bully the younger and newer ones. I had a girl pour a drink on me on purpose (a worker) and the manager didn't do anything about it so I smelled of alcohol the rest of my shift and then got in trouble for it. I have friends who worked at other Chili's and they love it and haven't had a problem. It depends on the MANAGEMENT. I ended up waiting 3 days in a row for over a hour and a half each day for an interview with each manager- that should've been my red flag.. . Also, Chili's does not drug test. That was a huge problem.","Don't lie to your employees, treat them like they are valued. If there is a problem, don't tell them to just tell another crew member where to go and how to get there, help them solve it. Work with your employees. I had several regulars who loved me and got mad when I told them I was leaving, I was valued by customers but not by the staff and that was why I had to leave. I stayed so long because of the amazing customers.

The turnover rate for managers was high, and as a server it definitely kept you on your toes -- and not in a good way. Some of the managers developed negative attitudes towards working there (the second they started their shift you could tell they did not want to be there) and were insanely incompetent; many of them did not understand the idea of leaving their personal life behind prior to coming into work and displayed clear favoritism towards particular employees. I experienced several instances of sexual harassment on part of the kitchen staff, and even after bringing it up to a manager, said manager did nothing to remedy the situation or even attempt to inform the GM (I did not feel comfortable discussing the situation personally with the GM). From what I understand now after speaking to former coworkers at the location, it appears that management is being cleaned up by the regional director (who, by the way, is actually fantastic at his job and probably the only superior I miss), so hopefully things will improve in the future.","Learn how to give clear direction and provide equal expectations (regardless of favoritism and/or personal relationships) to ALL employees.

Increasing your bottom line will actually increase your top line way more then you think. Having more servers on a night will allow those servers to give BETTER service bringing more business. Instead of 1 person doing a job for 3 people, have 3 people do the job of 1 person so that the 3 people can do the job better.

On a really really good night you can make anywhere from 150-200. You get six table sections. I absolutely loved 2 of my managers, they were wonderful. There was another manager who was new, he was previously a server but he was another one that I loved, those 3 really really cared about me and I loved them too.","Where do I start..... It depends on who's working in the kitchen to how your food comes out, if we had the wrong staff in the kitchen, my food would come out all messed up then I would look bad because 2 out of the 3 people sitting at my table's food came out incorrectly.. Too much running sidework, it wouldn't be such a big deal if we didn't have so many lazy people working because we don't schedule people based on the amount of side work they do, we schedule them based on their scores so the people with the highest scores get to stand around on their phone and not worry about side work or running food so it's always the same 3 people doing side work and running food and they never get called out for not doing anything because their ziosk scores are high, it's really ridiculous. And the people who are doing everything don't get noticed for it because their scores aren't high enough and their scores won't go up because their too busy doing all the side work for the people who's scores are high so it's just a ridiculous pattern.. And the hosts, not to mention the hosts... They don't check on the servers because they don't care if we're weeded, we have 6 table sections so if you get 6 tables at once, it's almost impossible to greet and make drinks for 6 tables at once so you pretty much just break down. And the managers don't say anything about the hosts doing this to us because as long as there's not a wait at the door, that's all that matters, it doesn't matter if they get horrible service or if their food takes 30-45 minutes to come out, as long as they're not standing at the door waiting, that's all that matters. Most of the time, the managers are helping the hosts sit us 6 times in a row then wonder why we're drowning.. We're a team based restaurant so we have a partner in the floor which is sometimes good but most of the time bad because if you have a partner like me who works hard, it gives you as my partner an excuse to go stare at the kitchen for your food and ask me to do a bunch of stuff for your tables or for you to go to the bathroom or smoke while I watch your tables.. We close an hour later than any other restaurant so the last hour, we get crapped on.. We also do a bunch of cheap cheap deals so we get all the bad tips. The average check is 20$ so 15% of 20$ does not add up to much at the end of the night, you wind up doing more work for less money so a 6 table section doesn't really make a difference.. The 3 managers that I talked about in the pros were awesome but there was one who constantly yelled at us and talked disrespectful to the people he didn't wanna screw or didn't hang out with. He was also the one that made the schedule so only his favorites got a good schedule, like this one girl who wasn't even a very good server and I constantly had to cover her butt because she couldn't handle more than 2 tables but because he wanted to screw her she got the schedule she wanted. I heard him constantly talk about screwing her. There was one time every body could hear this particular manager yelling all the way at the front of the restaurant at an employee, it was really unprofessional and he doesn't deserve to be a manager.","Pay better attention to your servers who are doing all the side work, stop only paying attention to a score that doesn't make any difference. The score has nothing to do with your server, it's not based on attentivness, it's based on whether or not they wanna return to a restaurant that may or may not have been dirty or a restaurant that their food might have taken 40 minutes or maybe their food was sent out with something their server 86'd but because I didn't run their food, I didnt see that it had something it wasn't suppose to on it or they had a kid in the next booth screaming in their ears or base it on the fact that they couldn't get sat in a booth instead of a table or that the bartender took a year and a day to make their drinks or maybe the host just sat me with 5 other tables and I really just couldn't control the service I have them.. Not everything is based off of a score that doesn't mean anything about my serving ability. Pay more attention to who actually cares and who actually is a good server but is just stuck covering everybody else's butts and doing the work for them. Pay better attention to what is really going on and not just what YOU wanna think is going on because 9 times out of 10, you're wrong.",3.093466895938883,2.962913772271971,2.992918070766646,3.4660654219275577,3.2911943382300377,3.498938332105128,3.243276773754819,3.0694672433961854,3.041245646472118,"""General Manager""",3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2016-10-13,Current,Restaurant General Manager,np.nan,Yes,Neutral,Yes,Full-time,More than 3 years,Some great people to work with.,Unrealistic labor goal expectations.

Upper management can often let their tempers get the best of them and the company uses religion to cover up the many character flaws or its people which include blaming those down the management team structure, a lack of knowledge on what it means to run a restaurant leading to ridiculous expectations that are used subjectively at every store depending on how much upper management gets along with that Management Team or how much money they make for those above them. There is a lack of respect for tenure and it actually tends to harm a lot of middle management because they will find a reason to replace you if you are making too much money. The company has a lack of understanding of the communities it serves and holds all restaurants to the same goals in turnover regardless of the workforce available to the area. Retaliation often occurs in this company keeping its employees to present their true problems and feelings. Assistant managers are in and out of the stores almost as much as the hourly employees because the training program is not holding everyone to the same level of accountability causing the stores to be short staffed so much so that everyone is expected to travel to guest manage at stores that are up to 80 miles from their home.","Follow your Inverted Pyramid, Don't be naive to think that your Regional Managers are all doing their jobs with the morals and ethics that The person who started this once great company expects of his employees.
