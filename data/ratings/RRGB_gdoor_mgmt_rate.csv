The culture of honor, integrity, seeking knowledge and having fun has completely disappeared. People are being pushed through training because all the old staff was fired when our management changed. If you plan on working in the front of house, be prepared to be questioned about giving out royalty cards to all your tables and where you stack up on the ""scorecard"" (which rates servers by number of appetizers and drinks sold, and entree averages). The management (at my store) is quick to dish out complaints and criticize, but is very frugal with their compliments. Recently because of such a large influx of new staff, food takes longer to come out because of mistakes and servers not having the skills to keep up with a high volume store.","Red Robin has been one of the most profitable companies the past few years, you obviously were doing something right. Not that I am opposed to change, but I feel as though nothing has been retained of your previous culture, which everyone loved. When you have happy staff you have happy customers.

Management is willing to work with you and try to keep you happy.","The types of customers this place attracts were a killer for me. Unfortunately, a large amount of the patrons that frequent Red Robin in Hendersonville are nothing more than trash. Anyone who has worked in the service industry knows the kinds of demographics I'm talking about (teens, rednecks, and ninjas). That being said, getting stiffed on tips was a very common occurence.. . A lot of people want restaurant service on McDonald's money. They will be your most demanding customers and will smile to your face, thank you for the service, and then leave you nothing or an amount that serves as an insult. I don't know if people don't understand the fact that servers make just over $2 an hour, and are dependent on their tips, or they just don't care.. . Management is aware and symapthetic to the problem, but there really isn't anything they can do about it. I mean management's bottom line is sales, so at the end of the day you might get a ""that sucks, I'm sorry"" from them but as long as the bill is paid they don't care. Throw on top of that the fact that once your cut, you are no longer taking tables that net you money but you still have about 45 minutes to an hour of side work where you are working for essentially nothing. There were more than a few nights I walked out of there not even averaging minimum wage.. . Additionally, management gets all wrapped around the axel if your table orders water as a beverage. I understand that it is both in the restaraunt's and the servers' interest to get people to order sodas, teas, beers, etc. But management actually assigns a percentage number to you as a server and then gives you placement on the seating chart with the higher your number is. Essentially if you have a table of four and two of them order water to drink then your number is 50%. They look at anything below a 75% as bad. I never really understood the high emphasis put on this, because I can recommend all the freckled lemonaides in the world, but if someone wants water they are going to order it. Finally, management gets super worked up about the royalty program. The program is basically a card people get that they can swipe each time they eat there and eventually earn free meals. I get the reasoning behind the program, but the priority that is placed upon it just baffles me. They want you to start every greet with ""Hello, my name is ________, are you all members of our royalty rewards program?"". If they aren't then they want you to start explaining the program to them and telling them how you are going to sign them up for it. This makes for some very unnatural greets, because you have a table just staring at you like some used-car salesman while the whole time they just want you to take their drink order.. . If you are thinking about waiting tables in the Hendersonville area I would really recommend going somewhere that has a higher average bill. I'm not saying you will be immune from crappy customers, but chances are the higher prices on average will drive away a lot of the rift-raft.","No criticism of management, because as I said earlier a lot the restaurant's problems are systemic to the people that choose to go there.",2.635786598103809,2.635786598103809,2.635786598103809,2.979591836734694,3.11111393498869,3.3167111065531745,2.74443413729128,2.889235083346316,2.635786598103809,"""Disappointing Company""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2013-10-15,Current,Assistant Manager,Tampa,No,No,Neutral,Full-time,More than a year,"The benefit package is pretty good, that is why I stay for my family",They work you to death and than throw you away like garbage.

They focus on efficiency and much can be learned on the business side of things while working there. There is opportunity to move up and the management focuses on employee satisfaction. Fast pace environment and flexible hours are what to expect when working there.,Red Robin has needy guest which causes service to vary. It is like a penny stock; the fast pace can be great for money but also be its own worst enemy in that you may not be able to give exceptional service because of certain guest.

I can't stress enough what an AWFUL company/store this is. When I first started, tips were good and the sections were fair. As time has gone on, the company has made it clear what its priorities are, and they definitely don't include the employees. When the ACA went into effect, our store suddenly had so many servers that everyone was scrambling for hours - the company didn't want to have to pay insurance. Then the performance-based BS started: servers were/are penalized EXTENSIVELY and UNFAIRLY for not selling enough drinks or getting enough people to sign up for the ridiculous royalty program (bad sections, bad schedules, consistent reaming by management, etc; although some of the servers buy the general manager presents - including designer bags - and are able to keep their schedules and sections). Management has never been competent or fair. Before our regional manager was demoted, our general manager was never in the store (especially on holidays and weekends - all the other managers were working 6 days a week, she worked Monday and Tuesday afternoons), it was well-known the GM spent most of her time drinking and getting high at the bar next door, and the kitchen manager had a sexual harassment suit pending forever. Requests for days off/availability are often ignored or ""forgotten"" about. Some of the managers cuss employees out when calling off. When another server asked for the new regional manager's phone number to talk about the state of the store, she was threatened and told ""this isn't something you need to talk to him about"".. . This company is NOT one you want to work for, and you definitely want to stay away from this store! I've never worked for such a corrupt group of people before in my life. Horrible, horrible place.

I did work hard, and had previous experience, but I also was friends with a lot of the right people and quickly moved into the bar and then into hourly management.. . It's a typical restaurant though, easy menu, easy to pick up extra shifts to make money, work hard and do your job and help out when needed and you'll probably get what you want. I worked for a franchise, so I'm sure it was different that a corporate store, but I still think it was better than another restaurant I worked at where there was so much drama since there were so many high school aged servers.. . It really is pretty easy to move up though I feel like. I worked there for over 5 years and knew several servers that moved into management. So if that is your goal, it seemed fairly easy within this franchise.. . Another pro is that our owners were really good examples of constantly working. They could have easily come in and pointed out stuff that was wrong and then leave, but they would come in and actually work on those things with you (as far as cleanliness and inventory and food presentation).","Obviously lots of long days, especially when the restaurant was short-staffed. Having to work nights and weekends, which is typical of most restaurant jobs--luckily they weren't open too late. There seems to be a lot of management turnover or swapping, so they aren't always the most consistent.. . Also, they changed their training to the way corporate likes, which I honestly think has made it go downhill. Yes, all the paperwork quizzes sucked but at least servers came out of training with a little more knowledge.

You make your money mostly on tips, so leaving with your cash after every shift can be refreshing and extremely motivating.. Working less hours, but still making money. A lot of times you have the chance to work busy shifts, but end up making a day’s pay in a few hours. Instead of a 9 to 5, 8 hour days, you can make your money in sometimes 5 hours or less.. Always active. Serving tables means running around grabbing this and that, carrying trays, bringing plates to tables, etc. By constantly moving you are constantly keeping fit rather than sitting in one chair for hours at a time, staring at a computer screen. You’re always on the move.. You’re around people. Being around people means hearing interesting stories, interacting and laughing. You also get to witness some pretty crazy stuff (read our True Stories) because, let’s face it, there is always something interesting happening if you’re around people. If you’re a social person than this is your best opportunity because the friendlier you are…the better the tips!","With experience and loyalty comes great responsibility. That basically means that the more you know about the restaurant, whether it be from hostess to the back of the house, the more work you may have to do compared to your coworkers. People will rely on you and expect more of you, which could make for even more stress from you. Will you get paid for the extra weight you pull? Maybe not.. Having to work weekends. If you’re working in a restaurant, there is pretty much a 100% chance of working weekends. While all of your friend, family and loved ones are off on weekend getaways and having dinner parties, you are the one “stuck serving” all the people out for a night on the town.. Always having money on hand. Yes – this is also a pro! But, people who are apt to spending the cash they have could have a major problem with managing their money. Cash is so easy to spend, especially if all the staff is going out for a drink afterwards.. After a while – it takes a toll on your body. So many times, servers who have been working for years will feel the effects of carrying heavy plates and constantly being on their feet. Back problems and knee problems are not uncommon. Being a server puts a lot of stress on your body.. No benefits. Whereas other companies give their employees benefits from sick days to dental, most restaurants do not provide that for their employees. Are you sick? You have to show up or you don’t get paid.’. Having to deal with @$$holes. Yup, I hate to say it, but it’s true. People can be jerks and you will deal with a lot of them. It varies from people who know nothing about the restaurant business, impatient people, people who think you’re their slave, and just plain down-right MEAN people. I’m not saying you have to take whatever crap people throw at you, but if you don’t have a thick enough hide to let some thinks just roll off of you…then this is not the job for you.. The bad co-workers. Oh my goodness…there are so many of them! Bad coworkers will ruin your day and can make you lose your mind. It’s always the co-workers who are always late, constantly check their phone in the back, sneak out a million times a night for a smoke break, ignore their customers, talk back to the kitchen, are rude to your tables, asking for replacements but never replacing anyone, and run around looking like they are busy but never actually lifting a finger. It can drive you NUTS!!! Sometimes it makes you think “Why do I bother working so hard?” and can make your motivation just plummet to the ground.",Not all restaurants are the same. Each individual restaurant has their own sets of advantages and disadvantages to working as a waiter or waitress. Part of the decision is at least knowing what could potentially happen and having an all around idea of the good and the bad.

Minimum wage and no chance for raises in the front of house. Doesn't matter how long you have worked there. Kitchen get some raises but not much. The disorganization of head office is staggering. They also always give people that complain a gift card. Scammers know this. It happens all the time. Other restaurants I've worked at just thank people for the feedback. Plus endless coupons. And ""bottomless"" options. This has created a culture of cheap people taking advantage of the system. Why does red robin want this kind of clientele?

I think your co-workers understand with you that sometimes management isn't fair or that you get too much work. The pay is....okay. If you're a line cook, you get a free meal every workshift and it can be anything, basically. If it gets busy, managers will jump on and help you.","When it comes time to close, sometimes you have to do the entire thing by yourself, and its no easy goal. It is very hard to get your schedule changed if you're a kitchen worker. It is very high stress, and fast paced.. The managers can't seem to all agree with eachother on certain things and one of the managers at my restaurant seems to expect way too much, and treats employees as if they're children. The waiters don't leave the cooks alone, and this gets very annoying. You get one hour breaks. This can be bad or good. Good if its busy, then getting a one hour break is nice. Bad if you want more hours.. I often times feel very unappreciated and left alone to close by myself, doing 3 to 5 different things at once, and its expected that you finish your work with so many things to do, and if you don't, you will be scolded for it. At least from that one manager.. The schedules are way too fluid. I would have to close 3 to 4 days a row (leaving at 11pm or later), then open AND close for two days straight (9:30am to 10pm or later). Its not exactly fun having to sleep at 12am then waking up by 7am, and i've seen other co-workers have to do this too, but come in earlier. I think theres opportunity for advancement and benefits but i'm not sure what the requirements for that, but from what I understand, it takes a long time.","I think management needs to set clear ideas and goals, and not treat employees like children.

I met so many great people there. It was very fast paced with large sections. I made really good money most days. Trays were very light so if you have weak wrists like me it's the perfect waitress job. Ziosks make things easy for the servers because most guests will pay on them.,"A lot of the guests that come in are low class and I got bad tips more often than at other serving jobs I've had. Fortunately, you get a lot of tables so you can still make very good money. Management pushes you to upsell and get good guest surveys constantly. They tell you that if you do well you will get more closing shifts and higher up sections. However, my scores were consistently good but the best shifts were still always given to the servers with seniority. Sections were divided so that guests with kids are seated in a different area. Sometimes a certain section would be sat much less while the other section was overwhelmed. It made no sense!",Understand that there are things that servers cannot control.

I had to kiss a lot of booty..    You get half off one meal the day you work.,"The company gives outrageous numbers to meet. Starting on the managers...like Robin offer bottomless freckled lemonades but will only give the store credit for one and a half per guest while most drink like 4 or 5. So managers are always over used on product which forces them to only put ounce of strawberries when the recipe requires two ounces and I am pretty sure they water down the sodas to make up for it. That is just one example. So all the food is being shorted to make up for unrealistic expectations, there for cheating the guest on everything. They have to cheat times and make workers work more than one job code and always run short handed. They offer bottomless fries but won't give them to you unless all the food is sold, what do they care it is your tip not theirs. Robin has raised prices so much that they have to give out free food to get guests to even come in. Guess who doesn't get tipped on free food. Funny you still have to do all the work though. They are pulling expediters and planning on pulling busser jobs to save money. They would rather pay servers $3 an hour to do all those jobs...what do they care it is your tips not theirs if you don't have time to serve the guest..    You are graded on drinks per guest but some appetizers are counted as guests so you have to add waters to check them out. I was told that is because the company lies to their share holders to make it look like they have a higher guest count....guess who it hurts, the server..   People slip and fall all the time in our restaurant but they won't fix the slick floors..    I have had crew meetings where district managers say stuff like...we are not required to give breaks...and we are doing these things for you ha ha nothing is done for the employees at all. Everyone I work with hates the company. Even the managers have said how greedy this place is..   You have to use the table machine to order things and check people out but half ours are broken...guess who still gets graded on it, you. No excuses even if you don't have the tools to do your job..    All of the dishes come out dirty, gross. People eat off this stuff, why is that not an issue..   Red Robin took away raises and stopped giving them when the economy crashed what like 8 or 9 years ago and took away our 401ks and they are not coming back..    The store puts on a show when the bosses are there but it is filthy with trash everywhere and no one wears gloves when they are not there..    Half the workers have to do all the side work and the other half get to just make money and leave to save labor..    I personally have seen several labor laws broke and employee mistreated several times..    You won't have enough glasses or silverware because they can't order more...it would hurt the numbers and managers might not get their bonus..    The bartender has to take and bag all the to go order even though they rarely get tipped on them..    So say you make it to a closer position. They will cut all the employees off the floor and you will have to seat the door, serve, expedite the food, and buss your own table while 2-3 managers sit around and eat. They say it is a daily meeting but just talk about what they did last night or whatever. The poor guests have dirty tables all around them and have to wait on everything. This is hilarious because my store is a training store and trains managers, I can only imagine how bad other stores are. I have direct orders to throw certain things out or change things when health inspectors come in..    Don't eat here after 8pm because kitchen workers are cleaning walls, vents, and fryers and do not wash hands when food is rang in. They are also cussing you because you interrupted them..    I will see managers sit around for hours but won't give you time to go to the bathroom..    The computer system is terrible, goes down all the time. Don't even have buttons for some of the items..   The air conditioning is directly over the guest so they are always cold and you are alway hot and sweating. Let me add. I work in Missouri and our thermostat is controlled by their head quarters in like California or something. They don't turn on the air until we open...so you are a sweaty mess by the time you start. Heck half the time they won't even turn on the lights, you might have to open in the dark..    Your paycheck won't even cover half of your taxes..    Good luck getting ahold of HR they obviously don't care about any of this. You will not get a call back..    Our store to get trainers was like, anybody wanna be a trainer? So our trainer suck.. There is no incentive to train what so ever..     I watch managers just eat food off the line..     Have had to bend my morals many times..     You have to work all holidays, nights, and weekends if you want to make money..     Bosses will lie straight to your face..     Anything the company does ends up making you less money..     Company has a giving fund where they take credit for helping employees, but the money comes from us, every employee has to give a dollar a check..     Many more things I can't think of at the moment.","Stop being YES men.
