The veteran servers run the show and get off from barking out side work commands throughout the shift, which is actually the most passive aggressive and ineffective approach to getting running side work done. Newer servers that get cut first, get the most side work, the select closing servers give themselves minimal to no side work, and instead of putting in an effort to help out with the work that needs to be done throughout a shift, they shout out their commands. Instead of the management implementing a more effective running side work model, this approach is the accepted way to run things.. . During the interviews, the management suggests they cut based on performance, not seniority. With the absence of the management in the front of the house to observe newer servers performing well, the same servers always stay the latest, in the best sections of the restaurant, which leaves little money to be made for the newer crew. Upper management in the company are always riding restaurant management to get hours down, so most of the time, even on a busy Saturday, a shift doesn't last longer than three hours on the floor.. . During the interview and training process, the management and training servers imply that you will be applauded for your hard work, staying on top of running side work, rolling silverware throughout your shift, and will be rewarded for doing so. There is no acknowledgement for working hard, and clearly no benefits either, the same servers will continue to run the show and stay in the money making sections of the restaurant.. . I will note that so much work is left to the servers and it's tough for the restaurant management to involve themselves with the front of the house more because the company doesn't want to spend the money on an expediter, and bussers and runners. Besides the weekends, servers and management fill the shoes of an expediter, and servers also run and bus their tables, and always run other table's plates as well. If the management could focus on being management, and not expediters, things might run more fairly for the front of the house staff. If the servers had a food runner, they could manage more of the running side work.","To restaurant management - consider involving yourself more in the FOH.

If you need them to fix a problem you have to do 5 loops around the store just to find them and then wait 10 minutes or longer to even get their help. Management also spends a lot of their time making personal phone calls or goofing off when they should be paying attention to half of their staff that comes in high or drunk.. Training: The training is the ABSOULTE WORST. The scheduled trainer never is aware that they are suppose to be training you and when they finally are you've been behind a computer for 3 hours. No one fully teaches you how to handle all the different coupons, the Micros system and where all the buttons or areas are, or explains the promos.. As a new employee- other employees are not very accepting - they are actually quite rude and don't give you time to learn without judgment..

You'll no longer wonder why the gal at the drive through can't manage to understand, ""no cheese,"" and you won't be impatient when the new cashier doesn't know how the cash register works.. . You'll be patient, and you'll be respectful for what it takes to learn a job that everyone thinks is a no-brainer, but is actually as complicated as working a Rubik's cube while juggling flaming batons and changing a baby's diaper, all at the same time.","When was the last time you have researched market. trends in your area or did a comprehensive market. study and write-up for your restaurant? Have you. ever? If not, you are not alone.. . Failure to establish that there is a market for your. restaurant and the failure to stay abreast of market. trends, are two of the most tragic mistakes a restaurant. owner can make, especially because these mistakes. can easily be avoided.. . Even something as simple as a stop and greet survey. on the street can establish consumer likes and dislikes,. perceptions, needs and demands.. . Before opening their restaurant’s doors, restaurant. owners should establish a demand for their cuisine or. service, and an ability to capture a market share.. Once those doors have opened, restaurant owners. should analyze the direction of consumer demand and. make changes and adjustments accordingly. Without a. fact-based knowledge of the market, an informed. decision is not possible.","Good managers are the most underrated people on the planet. At a restaurant, this is easy to observe. A bad manager drives away the best employees, alienates the customers, and assuring that the quality of food deteriorates to that of a first grader's school lunch left on the bus during summer vacation.. . The good manager does the exact opposite: luring the best workers and motivating them to do even better. Managing to please (most of) the customers without hanging their staff members out to dry. They help build an environment where the chef can do his best work, raising the quality of the food and drink offerings ever higher.. . Restaurants can instill all the values of respect, teamwork, and good management skills as the military, only without all the danger. These skills are valuable wherever you go and whatever you do the rest of your life.

At some locations, I *guarantee* you can ask any employee hired in the last 2-3 years: ""What does NNBS stand for?"" and she will have no clue. Or, ""Explain the four stages of Fridays Service Style,"" and he'll just give you a blank stare. Even something as simple as, ""What does the longboat in your store represent?"" and you'll get an answer of, ""What? What longboat?!"" There's great training available, BUT ONLY if you're looking in a location that really honors the ""old"" values. I was hired at one location where the manager started my training off with an absolutely fantastic orientation session, and I had basically the same two ""coaches"" (trainers) who WORKED TOGETHER to make my training period (5 days) not only informative and effective, but also enjoyable! After a while, I transferred to another location in search of better opportunity. They had a new kid train me, even though I'd been working at a much higher volume location for over a year. I mean, he was a nice guy--and pretty competent, too! But he was also inexperienced and somewhat naive about the business. Pretty soon, I became the main ""coach"" because of my level of experience and my variety of jobs within the company. (I also worked as a server, busser, and food runner... even some dishwasher shifts!) When I trained new employees, I made sure they really understood the concepts I was taught at my old store, because that was how the company *wanted* everyone trained... it's just that the store to which I transferred places almost no importance on good training. It's just a negative cycle, and that's a major reason why things have gone so far downhill since I was originally hired in 2013.. . The other reason? It's huge. Ya' ready? Okay, here goes... STOP ROLLING OUT THOSE COST-RAISING, MORALE-LOWERING, IMPLICITLY-TIP-EXEMPTING, CHEAP-CLIENTELE-ATTRACTING PROMOS!!!!! When you big wigs come up those GENIUS (i.e. really crappy) schemes like ""Endless Apps"" (or worse, ""Endless CHOICE"") and ""Jump Burger"" and ""2 for $10"" and ""Rib Flight Trio"" and anything else that advertises free food or substantially lowered prices of the same menu items that our Guests should, and otherwise WOULD, be buying at full price, you bring in a different breed who are no longer deserving of the designation ""Guest,"" or even ""Customer."" ...People who don't tip, blatantly disregarding the basic societal rule that they should tip the server AT LEAST 18-20 percent of their pre-comp, pre-tax bill because the server provided BEYOND SPECTACULAR service. ...People who get up and LEAVE the establishment AFTER being seated and ordering beverages, just because the answer to ""Are y'all still doin' that 2 for $20 deal?"" was not the ""Yes"" they were looking to get. (Mind you, the ""2 for $20"" was something that Chili's does... NOT Fridays. And the Fridays' equivalent, the ""2 for $10""? It ended for the last time about 2 years ago. So no, we do not have ""that 2 for $20 deal""!!) ...And people who get ticked off when their check is listed out exactly how the server told them it would be BEFORE the order was entered. Oh, but they were too busy gabbing with the other dozen people in their party and just ""couldn't hear"" the rule about the charge for Endless Apps being PER PERSON. Well, I'm (not) sorry, but DUH! you can't feed 13 people with as much as they can eat and expect the bill to only come up to $10! P.S. There's a $2 upcharge when you switch out the appetizers. Yeah, your server told you that at the beginning, too.. . Last little tip I'm going to put out there: Make working at Fridays more EXCITING (or at least satisfying!) by providing better benefits. For example, make the Black Card available at EVERY location, not just some. I worked with TGI Fridays for just under the 3 years required to get a Red Card (I was 22 days short, to be exact), and I kid you not... $4 off a meal that normally costs $19-something is NOT a benefit that makes me positively thrilled to work at Fridays. I never got a Black Card. I only learned about it from the bartender at another Fridays while on vacation in the Midwest. Nor did I get a Red Card. Like I said, 22 days longer, and I'd have gotten it... maybe. Like, if I bugged my manager about it enough so he'd order the card just to get me off his back. Regardless, I did not feel like the time I spent working there was valued... because there was no incentive to keep going. Stripes Members get more out of Fridays than employees do! Heck, Guests who COMPLAIN (even a smidge) get far more than we do... So my advice to upper management? Make it a SPECIAL experience to work at Fridays. Not just standard. And definitely not sub-par.. . I'm not bitter about my experiences with Fridays, and I do realize that these things could happen in ANY restaurant. But I am relieved and consider myself very fortunate to be establishing a new career path, and I mourn for those who still work with this company and are ""stuck""--because that does happen, too. Please consider improving the employee experience by taking the above notes into serious consideration.

There's great training available, BUT ONLY if you're looking in a location that really honors the ""old"" values. I was hired at one location where the manager started my training off with an absolutely fantastic orientation session, and I had basically the same two ""coaches"" (trainers) who WORKED TOGETHER to make my training period (5 days) not only informative and effective, but also enjoyable! After a while, I transferred to another location in search of better opportunity. They had a new kid train me, even though I'd been working at a much higher volume location for over a year. I mean, he was a nice guy--and pretty competent, too! But he was also inexperienced and somewhat naive about the business. Pretty soon, I became the main ""coach"" because of my level of experience and my variety of jobs within the company. (I also worked as a server, busser, and food runner... even some dishwasher shifts!) When I trained new employees, I made sure they really understood the concepts I was taught at my old store, because that was how the company *wanted* everyone trained... it's just that the store to which I transferred places almost no importance on good training. It's just a negative cycle, and that's a major reason why things have gone so far downhill since I was originally hired in 2013.. . The other reason? It's huge. Ya' ready? Okay, here goes... STOP ROLLING OUT THOSE COST-RAISING, MORALE-LOWERING, IMPLICITLY-TIP-EXEMPTING, CHEAP-CLIENTELE-ATTRACTING PROMOS!!!!! When you big wigs come up those GENIUS (i.e. really crappy) schemes like ""Endless Apps"" (or worse, ""Endless CHOICE"") and ""Jump Burger"" and ""2 for $10"" and ""Rib Flight Trio"" and anything else that advertises free food or substantially lowered prices of the same menu items that our Guests should, and otherwise WOULD, be buying at full price, you bring in a different breed who are no longer deserving of the designation ""Guest,"" or even ""Customer."" ...People who don't tip, blatantly disregarding the basic societal rule that they should tip the server AT LEAST 18-20 percent of their pre-comp, pre-tax bill because the server provided BEYOND SPECTACULAR service. ...People who get up and LEAVE the establishment AFTER being seated and ordering beverages, just because the answer to ""Are y'all still doin' that 2 for $20 deal?"" was not the ""Yes"" they were looking to get. (Mind you, the ""2 for $20"" was something that Chili's does... NOT Fridays. And the Fridays' equivalent, the ""2 for $10""? It ended for the last time about 2 years ago. So no, we do not have ""that 2 for $20 deal""!!) ...And people who get ticked off when their check is listed out exactly how the server told them it would be BEFORE the order was entered. Oh, but they were too busy gabbing with the other dozen people in their party and just ""couldn't hear"" the rule about the charge for Endless Apps being PER PERSON. Well, I'm (not) sorry, but DUH! you can't feed 13 people with as much as they can eat and expect the bill to only come up to $10! P.S. There's a $2 upcharge when you switch out the appetizers. Yeah, your server told you that at the beginning, too.. . Last little tip I'm going to put out there: Make working at Fridays more EXCITING (or at least satisfying!) by providing better benefits. For example, make the Black Card available at EVERY location, not just some. I worked with TGI Fridays for just under the 3 years required to get a Red Card (I was 22 days short, to be exact), and I kid you not... $4 off a meal that normally costs $19-something is NOT a benefit that makes me positively thrilled to work at Fridays. I never got a Black Card. I only learned about it from the bartender at another Fridays while on vacation in the Midwest. Nor did I get a Red Card. Like I said, 22 days longer, and I'd have gotten it... maybe. Like, if I bugged my manager about it enough so he'd order the card just to get me off his back. Regardless, I did not feel like the time I spent working there was valued... because there was no incentive to keep going. Stripes Members get more out of Fridays than employees do! Heck, Guests who COMPLAIN (even a smidge) get far more than we do... So my advice to upper management? Make it a SPECIAL experience to work at Fridays. Not just standard. And definitely not sub-par.. . I'm not bitter about my experiences with Fridays, and I do realize that these things could happen in ANY restaurant. But I am relieved and consider myself very fortunate to be establishing a new career path, and I mourn for those who still work with this company and are ""stuck""--because that does happen, too. Please consider improving the employee experience by taking the above notes into serious consideration. Thank you.",2.5909760342750037,2.624232192248286,2.68718344768131,3.031152993348115,2.893657019162879,3.29801835132084,2.777762445234069,2.926780844610955,2.6042784974643167,"""TGI FRIDAYS MANAGEMENT""",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2016-04-05,Past,Restaurant Manager,Carrollton,Yes,Neutral,Yes,Part-time,More than 10 years,"Fantastic, progressive company that invests in peoples development.

Then you're more busy than anyone else which is clearly the case and management's gets on you about bussing your tables which that's what the hostesses were supposed to be doing if it's really busy.

There are great things about the company. They give you a chance when a lot of places won't. If you work hard and are at the right location you can make good money.

I've worked 40+ hour weeks and made $200 many times bc of the tip pool and over-staffing of shifts. I've also made $700 in a week...point being its inconsistent. After working at another place I have a better understanding of how much work is involved at fridays. A lot is expected out of their employees, especially the bartenders. It also seems unlikely to advance. You'll have a better chance to advance and make more money elsewhere. My advice world be to work at Fridays, try to get behind the bar, but never stop looking for better jobs. You don't want to get stuck there forever without ever advancing or making enough to pay your bills.","Recognize the value of your employees. I was there for 6 years.

Friday's,. . Where individuals are trusted to do their very best every day regardless of their competence. On the surface, this may seem like recipe for disaster, but Friday's has a secret ingredient to bake the perfect success pie every time. Everyone is given the tools to succeed and trained extensively to use them with perfect form. Once an individual has the epiphany that serving is as simple as following a few steps and smiling, dropping the need to overcomplicate things and get to it, they will be successful with very little micromanagement. Adding to the total amount of tables one can serve at a time only when ready, and taking them back without a lecture or any voiced disappointment keeps servers motivated to maintain tables, but doesn't give a feeling of failure or rip the will to succeed from those who may be struggling o navigate through a rough patch.. . The endless metrics and numbers seem complicated (PPA, Table Turn Time, Customer Surveys, Liquor sale percentage, etc) but the reality is simple. Follow the Friday's Style and you watch your stats go up. It becomes clear early on that posting the numbers in real time isn't a reason to discipline employees, but a motivator. I big bulletin board of how hard everyone is working.. .  I had no idea how great T.G.I. Friday's is until I had my second job serving. I was astonished by the lack of professionalism and tools for success in most other restaurants. I will always regret leaving for the reasons I did and be grateful for the confidence Friday's awarded me, and the skills I was taught.. . To conclude, here's a list of what Friday's offers, and what I will take with me always I as grow into a young manager of my own.. . -The training program has detailed, easy steps to create a structured interaction with the customer. This helps servers gain confidence and know exactly what they should be doing, and when to do it so they can get the best tip possible. If you follow the service style from the training program you WILL have happy customers.. . -The management is endlessly patient. It took me almost a month to learn the menu and be ready to take my own tables, but management kept pushing me to succeed and continued to give me the tools to succeed where others would have let me burn out.. . -Continued education into better departments helped many people as I was serving. I saw my peers move from serving to bartending with the same structure and tools that helped me learn to serve. They were not ""promoted"" until they had proven they were ready, and then they were given the utmost confidence and patience as they moved to their new position seamlessly. I saw hosts become servers, and dishwashers become hosts. Everyone had an opportunity to improve and they were trusted to be successful when it happened.. . -Friday's is true to itself. It doesn't have white table cloths or formal hosts. The menu doesn't give gimmicky names and copy cat recipes. It's not uncommon for fast casual chains to try to appeal to the market by appearing higher class or overly family friendly to mask the fact that they're just a name on a long list of nearly identical restaurants that a guest could choose. Conversely, Friday's embraces its normality by playing the role of ""corner bar"" where guests are greeted by what I called the ""Hey how are ya"" attitude.","The restaurant's constant desire to improve was endearing, unfortunately with risk often comes failure. For example, the menu took a complete overhaul with little warning, and that created a gap where servers had been trained so strictly to work with a specific menu that no longer existed.. . On the same subject, that constant push for improvement had many of the high performing employees feeling unrewarded. As some individuals put in the effort and surpassed their peers with the motivation of ""winning"" and shining to the top as performer, it would be seen by management as a reason to push the individuals harder and set a standard for the other employees who may be putting their best into another metric, or struggling to keep up.. . Although, I'm sure this varies from location to location, the restaurant I had the pleasure of serving in struggling with a major communication issue. It would not be uncommon for the kitchen to be on an entirely different page than the servers or the bartenders to be lost in a crowd and have food run incorrectly. I do believe management meant well, and that this problem would be solved easily if it was addressed.","Although I am immensely underqualified to give advice to any company so large, I can give an idea of my observations so you (the reader) can decide of these culture shortcomings are something you are willing to deal with, or if applying for the right position, tackle. As a business owner myself now, in an entirely different industry, here are my thoughts.. . -Never has a coupon cutting, freebie grabbing customer been a customer I would want to encourage. Friday's uses many cost-cutting tactics to get people in the door. A great example is the Unlimited Apps program.

Have to be on the ball with ID'ing etc - place is prone to kids coming in trying to get served. Larger branches have no team spirit and are particularly cliquey amoung staff. Management can't handle the larger branches - staff recognition systems are sporadic and irregular. Never have enough badges etc. Often badges go unrewarded or staff just help themselves when they come across the boxes.. You're made to feel guilty for taking a break on a double shift as it requires a standby to be called in.",At peak times have a manager stationed on every floor. On a friday night your staff do not have time to leave their section and travel down three flights to find a manager!,2.9215423751506227,2.762796795861921,2.774550091598115,3.0429046563192905,2.8445050725266006,3.210935579608393,2.87746184026068,2.818111571985627,2.858044143435142,"""Difficult at times""",3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2017-11-13,Past,Assistant General Manager,Nashville,Yes,Yes,Yes,Part-time,More than 5 years,Always changing the menu means always bringing in guests.
