55,Jeff H.,"Honolulu, HI",265,64,22.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"Grand Opening was today, and I had to renew my registration at Pearlridge, so I stopped in. No line, no wait, just me, so I sat at the bar. No TVs yet, Direct TV is on its way. I have been to many Applebee's on the mainland and know what they are all about. I am glad to see them in three locations on Oahu- PR, Kapolei and Ewa.  I ordered the appetizer sampler. I got the brew pub pretzels, chicken won ton tacos and artichoke dip with chips. My bartender was Kalena and she was excellent- attentive and made an excellent cherry Pepsi.  My food came really quick. The chips and artichoke dip were hot. The chips were not drained properly so they tasted stale, a soft crunch. But hey, it is their fault, first day. A manager came over and understood my description, apologized and started a new batch.  My pretzels came and instead of beer cheese dip, it had mustard dressing and ranch. A manager, Ryan came by and got me the right dip. The pretzels had no toppings on them (salt and cheese, like in the menu picture). He apologized and brought the toppings out. By this point, I was the ""problem customer"", but the staff did not make me feel that way, I just felt that way. Ruel, the cook/chef came out to check on me and I told him that all the issues I had were manini and indicative of restaurants as they newly open.  The fire alarm went off while I was there, but again, just a growing pain.  The food was excellent. My fave was the won ton tacos. The pretzels were better than the pretzel restaurant that is in the mall too- Pretzel Anne's.  The chips that were fixed were really good, just need a sprinkle of salt. But texture and flavor were good.  Applebee's is not a culinary delight destination with aspirations of food awards, but I expect quick service, good prices and tasty food. This new location is right on track for that. The managers and wait staff stepped up, fixed issues and the back room crew sent out tasty food. I enjoyed my experience at this Applebee's and left with a full opu and money still in my wallet. They will give their competitors a challenge and Pearlridge shoppers another affordable option for meals. Stop in and try their chicken won ton nachos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

Sat us quickly and immediately our server was at our table! This was nice since most places take for ever! She got us a sampler and then that's when it started! Our sampler was to come with honey bbq wings but came with buffalo. I was excited to eat there, I figured it was a little mistake easy fix! It took 20 mins to get the replacement wings, already 20 mins into our dinning experience that's 40 mins! I asked for ranch that didn't get to me until 10 mins later. Then after another 20 mins that pass by we where told that there was a mix up in the kitchen and our manager will be up to talk to you. Another 10mins pass by and finally our food comes out with the manager and all she asked if the food looked good and didn't address the issue . Ready to eat I mix my food up, load and behold a blue plastic trash in in my food. Sent it back and cancelled it, no manager to come to address the issue again! Wow! I even told my mom we should eat there then told her we are definitely not going back. The waitress Victoria was ok.

I don't know what happened, but slowly over time I think the cooks didn't care as much. I've been anxiously waiting for this Applebee's to open. I had to see if they would be better than the ones I'd been to recently on the mainland. Today as I was walking through the mall, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were open. I was quickly seated and my waiter Khalen was quite pleasant as he suggested items to drink. I gave him my order and he was back quite promptly with my water. This had given me a short time to look at their ample menu. I chose the macaroni with 4 cheese and crispy honey chicken tenders. Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly and made sure I was taken care of. My meal arrived in a timely manner and was surprisingly good. I was quite full and in a hurry to get some Christmas shopping done or I would have tried one of my favorite desserts they make...the blondie.

The Food Was Great as well as the time it came out in.  Dessert was the Best Part ,  The BLONDIE is to kill for.  During our meal the Manager Gladys came by and made sure everything was to our liking as well as our expectations.  Gladys was very professional and had a special Aloha Spirit in her that made us feel at home.....Kudos to the entire staff and wonderful new restaurant to the Aiea area.  I will definitely recommend this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=80,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005

Food came out decently fast and delicious! Heard a lot of complaints from other customers about wait time for food and said that their service sucks. Let me just say it's not up to the severs when your food comes out. When it's done they bring it to you. Trust me if it was up to them they would have you in and out as fast as possible. Also kitchen is working as hard as they can. They can't serve you raw food so patience is key. Also, if you don't currently work in a restaurant or have not in the last five years let me just say you really should not talk like you know. Because yes Barbra it took a full fifteen minutes to get your food out but guess what you probably couldn't make that pasta any faster at home. Don't come out at prime time dinner rush and go to a full restaurant and expect your food to be out in five minutes. If you're going to think that way and be rude you should just stay at home and make a microwaveable dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=60,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

4,Lola P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,6.0,1.0,2017-12-14,"Awful! We chose this spot because I am pregnant and had a craving for it and because it had the highest rating of the other locations. Sadly I left still hungry.  We were seated quickly. We ordered our food and then realized that our meals are on the 2 for 25 so we should have gotten an appetizer.  We flagged the waitress down and brought it to her attention and she seemed confused and unfamiliar with which meals qualified. After she confirmed she said since she already put our meals in the appetizer would come after our meals, no problem. Not much longer our food comes out and I bite my fries which are cold as can be and my chicken tenders look old as well. I don't like to complain so I started to deal with it but I just couldn't. Our waitress didn't deliver our food and never followed up so I waited probably 20mins before finally just asking a random server for some service. Within 2 minutes a man comes by with the replacement. And the fries are slightly heated up and the chicken as well. Looks old and is slightly heated up. I picked the chicken up and it is practically sitting in oil. To me it appeared as if they had just recooked or refried the original chicken.. again I try to deal with it because I really wanted this and it was a little warmer. But I was so pissed off that they tried to serve me the same food instead of fixing it the right way plus it was drenched in oil. I literally had to squeeze it with my napkin before trying to eat it. And the fries are cold and seasonless, nothing like the mainland. Anyway 20+mins later waitress finally comes by. I tell her I'm not happy she asks if I want it made fresh... in my head im like yea that should have been the original plan but now I can't trust you guys to not do anything to my food so no. I simply told her no. At this point we still never got our appetizer and we had to remind her. She didn't bring any condiments we asked for when we ordered everything and when we reminded her she acted like it was her first time hearing it. Her excuse for the staff is that they were new and she had to go back and personally make our appetizer. Which was also off. The whole experience was a turn off, i know every place has off days but i dont think we will go back back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=20,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.6920000000000006,3.84

Secondly, they round out of what my other friend wants to order and they suggested something else, but thats no problem cause we understand because the place was just recently open. Then when my friend finally gets her compromise order,  the sirloin wasn't  well cook as my friends requested. So she ask for it to cook again. She waited too long and when her ordered finally came then they forgot the Shrimp and sauce again on the sirloin!!!  Remember this is my other friend. She kind a lost her appetite already because two of her friend almost done eating. I think  the managers came to us like three/four times to apologized many times for the mistake on our food. Manager give us discount ($5) for the  inconvenience... In our opinion the food wasn't that taste good, it was so so. Also tomato basil soup no taste at all.

They let the phone ring until voice mail, then i called for the third time and the lady hung up on me once she recognized my voice. Called again only to be put on HOLD AGAIN mid sentence, of course i hung up and redialed, demanded to speak to the manager and told them i had been waiting for days now. They transferred me to the assistant manager which was a guy that had a major attitude. I had asked to speak to the main manager and he was like ""why"" ""who am i speaking to"", only to find out that the main manager was SUPPOSEDLY not here again. I explained to him how i had been waiting for days and he said ""I'll give her a call right now and make sure she will call you tomorrow when she comes in"". The next day came and went and i have still yet to hers back from the manager. Tomorrow will make a week of me trying to get in touch with the manager and i have had no contact with her yet.

77,Yah Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-15,"I had high hopes of great food since I ate at an applebees in another state and it was not bad. This wasn't the case. The service was great but the food was bad. The spinach dip came out and it was decent but there were a lot of small broken chips and the bottom chips were really oily. I ordered the bourbon street chicken and shrimp and my wife ordered some shrimp wonton thing. When my chicken came it was literally half a chicken with some remnants. They actually cut half of the chicken off and put some mangled remnant piece in its place. It looked like a child portion. Then the shrimp wasn't on top of it, it was spread around the dish. The shrimp looked like something precooked and thrown on the plate. The chicken was dry and the shrimp had no flavor. I asked them to take it off the bill and I didn't want to eat it. My wife's shrimp looked like the exact same shrimp but thrown on a different type of dish. Hers was lacking sauce.  The manager came and was very apologetic. She did a good job handling the situation. The service was great but the food sucked. I hope  they can step their game up or they won't last in Hawaii for very long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=80,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.7560000000000002,3.6800000000000006

A beer on tap took over half an hour to arrive at our table, orders made in advance for the 2 children so they could have food and drinks during our wait time came out both too late and incorrectly and our food really wasn't that great either.

31,A M.,"Aiea, HI",0,2,,2.0,2017-12-18,"My boyfriend and I were stoked to try the new Applebees in Pearlridge. It had only been a couple of weeks since it opened but we were willing to give it a chance. The overall experience was quite disappointing.  When we first put our name in, we were told it would be about a 35 minute wait. We waited for about 45 minutes (10 minutes over time...not that bad). Once seated, we waited over 15 minutes for the waiter to come and bring us drinks (we didn't even have water at our table.) After he came back, we ordered our food. I ordered the 2 appetizers for $12.99 (the chicken wonton tacos and the pretzels with the beer cheese dip) and my boyfriend ordered mac & cheese with chicken. The restaurant had started to empty out by the time we put our food in so we figured the wait shouldn't be long. Of course, ""this is not going to go the way you think."" We waited for well over 40 minutes for food with an apology after around half hour. (Feeling mildly annoyed)  Noticing the families around us, we had one family who came around 20 minutes after us got their food before us and another family who came before us got their food after us. I'm not sure what was wrong in the kitchen but I put no blame on the waiter/waitresses on the wait time matter. The waiter, however, did not check on us as often as he should. He was good with refilling our drinks but when it came time for the check, we waited for another 15-20 minutes. Noticing most of the waiters and waitresses, their customer service could be improved overall.  After the lengthy wait, the food was not up to par. My boyfriend's mac and cheese was a little cold and after the length of time we were waiting, you would expect the food to have been hot and fresh. The waiter also brought out my pretzels with the beer cheese dip and immediately took it off the plate and brought it back to the kitchen (not sure what was wrong with the one that was on the plate but he took it away quickly.) That (of course) took about 10 minutes for another cheese. The chicken wonton tacos were okay but not worth the 40 minute wait. My boyfriend generously gives the food a 6/10 where I would give it a 5/10.  Overall, the food was not worth the 40 minute wait and the dinner experience was not worth the whole 2 hours. We hadn't voiced our frustration about the wait time but the waiter mistakenly told us that our food would be covered by the hostess (which it wasn't) but he did take off our sodas from our tab so we were very appreciative of that. He did take note on how long we were waiting so it was nice of him to acknowledge that. We still decided that it isn't worth going back to this Applebees for awhile...give it maybe a year or two till they get their system down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.0480000000000005,3.2000000000000006

Not bad wait time being peak time less then a week before Christmas. When i looked up there were about 8 empty tables waiting to be cleared or swept under it.

Restrooms are behind the hostess stand They have lots of tv's and a bar Ordered the 2 for $25 which comes w/ 1 appitizer and 2 meals. Also ordered the chicken wonton tacos bcuz it looked good and it was. Our waitress was Kacie she was  super nice and efficient. We didn't wait long for the appetizers and main course once we ordered. Ask her for recommendations she has her favs too.  The grill chicken on the oriental chicken was a little over cooked but the salad itself was tasty. Overall everything we ordered we enjoyed...ate family style. If you don't like to wait to be seated go during off peak hours, when we left after 1pm the place was emptying out and there was no one  waiting at the door.

The dip was good but we couldn't understand why there was a GIANT chunk of cheese in it. It made it very difficult to eat cause it was solid. But other than that, we enjoyed it and ate around it.  As for my Shrimp & Chicken Platter, it came in a skillet with some home fries & sautéed onions. My shrimp and chicken was covered in garlic butter and made everything super flavorful! The home fries were nice and crispy and didn't even need ketchup because of all the flavor from the onions and garlic butter! (I loooove ketchup so that's saying a lot!) The onions soaked up all the flavor at the bottom of the skillet and so did the chicken and shrimps. The chicken itself wasn't too dry either. I would definitely get this dish again.  My date loved her Oriental Chicken Salad. I do wish their potion size this this entree was a bit more but it did have a generous serving of crispy fried chicken. It probably needed a bit more veggies to balance it out. But, I must say, the chicken itself was very crisp and not oily at all. My date also mentioned really enjoyed the dressing! Definitely a go to if you want a lighter and somewhat healthier meal.  Overall, this was a great deal! My only complaint was the food took EXTREMELY long to come out. Like 20+ minutes and our appetizer and entrees came out at the same time. They're still pretty new so I won't hold it against them too much. I'd definitely be back again for that awesome $25 deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.6079999999999997,3.4800000000000004

76,Savannah A.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-30,"Today was our first day trying Applebee's and I have to say it was the WORSE food we have ever ate. The spinach pasta had deep fried spinach on it which tasted like they grabbed a bunch of leaves outside in a tree & fried it in a bunch of oil and put it all in the plate. The four cheese Mac with the chicken strips was way worse. It had three small strips which look like they just heated it up and tasted like it came from a store bought refrigerator (like sams or cosco). They also may have put bbq sauce which was suppose to be like a pepper sauce on the Mac but tasted so off. Oh and no bacon!. The 6oz sirloin was cooked good but when you got it looked like a 3oz beef jerky. Now when you have to put a bunch of ketchup on it something tells me it could use some kind of seasoning! The only reason I gave it a one star is because our waiter Chelsea was great and the manager did apologize for how the food turned out!.

The poor waitress I had Leila was so sweet to us which was a table of 9!  Her service was in no way shape or form bad it was actually great and she tried her best to push food out when she couldn't.  That kitchen staff sucks sooo damn bad I got in at 5 on the dot and order by 5:15 but everyone's plate came except for myself and another member of my party.  I asked my sweet waitress Leila to remove my entreé. As soon as I asked for it to be removed which was 6:30 not only did my entree arrive but my other party members I spoke of arrived as well.  I don't think I'll be revisiting until the kitchen staff works out its kinks and orders more food instead of running out at the most prime time on a damn Saturday.   Outside of that Leila and Lauren if you ladies are reading thank you so much for your hospitality and kindness all the way through.  Btw where the hell was the manager while this madness happened.

49,Andrea C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,8,4.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"We came around lunch time so we were expecting a line which there was. We checked in and were told by the Hostess that it will take 15 minutes. 15 minutes went by then 30, I'm not one to complain but when I noticed people who came AFTER us getting called first I had to say something. I went up to the host stand and asked how much longer? She says ""Oh what name is your party under?"" I gave her my name and she said ""We already called you but I can seat you right now"". How can they have already called our name when we've literally been sitting right in front of them the whole time. I honestly think they just skipped us and, also how didn't it bother her that we've been sitting there for a while. I failed to get a name of this Hostess but only thing I can remember is that her foundation was too yellow for her skin tone.  Ok moving on to the reason why this review is getting a 3 star was our bomb waiter Jose. Always checking in on us, made sure our drinks were filled and was all around very kind.  Food was alright, we ordered the Combo Appetizer which consist of quesadillas, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and chips with spinach dips. Everything was great but the  chicken wings was super super salty. The lady who brought out the appetizer also said she'll bring out the ranch dip for chickens but she didn't. I got the triple bacon burger, the bacon was crispy otherwise it taste like any ol' burgers. My friends enjoyed they chicken wrap and some kind of taco. (Sorry!)  Overall, the host stands needs to be more attentive and acknowledge their customers so they don't skip people. Prices are reasonable, there was 4 of us and our bill came out to $79 including drinks and appetizer.

The service was horrible. Our food came out before our drinks which were just water. Our server was horribly slow, and it took us longer to get the check and pay than it did to eat.

56,chrysanthe m.,"Honolulu, HI",6,23,8.0,3.0,2018-01-02,"I'm not really interested  in what Applebee's has to offer however am glad they opened in Pearlridge Uptown giving it more sit down dining options.  This location just opened so it's best to allow them to work out the kinks as most business do.  1. New and clean. However, it feels more like sitting in fast food then a restaurant because of the open seating, though there are booths.   2. They have easy access restrooms!  The former Farrell's had a very badly accessible restroom, otherwise you'd have to go into the mall restroom. 3. I only ordered French onion soup and house salad.  Was good!  The bacon on the salad could have been more ""fresher"" for aesthetic value but it still tastes like bacon, so good, minors!  But the rest of my party ordered steak items, and all 5 orders came out over cooked and incorrect. The kitchen is too new and needs to season more! 4. Servers are actually good.  And they check on you often.  I feel bad I forgot our servers name but she was excellent. 5. The tattooed manager who took care of us, I forgot her name. But she's very sincere and super cool.  6. They have happy hour and alcohol and will have more soon.  I could have wrote a better review but I'm in a rush right now.  I will update because I know my mom will want to come back and she likes Applebee's in the mainland.  After I lose my first 5 lbs of the year I'll order some ribs.  Ok.

44,Diana L.,"Honolulu, HI",318,195,320.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"First time. And probably last time. I've heard about this place, but never had any real desire to dine here, but my husband insisted that we checked them out while running errands at Pearlridge Mall. This Applebee's is located inside the mall at Pearlridge Uptown. It is on the first floor on the side closer to TJ Maxx. You can't miss it. Tons of parking. We arrived here a little past the lunch hour and waited a bit to be seated. They're understaffed right now, so understandable.  Eventually we were seated and our waitress came by to get our drink orders. Don't get me wrong: the staff is very friendly, though they seem a bit inefficient. Not sure if it's due to the understaffing or the newness of the place. Got our menus but no share plates, no napkins, and no utensils. No biggie.  As for the food - this is where my un-satisfaction comes from. My husband and I opted for the ""Build Your Own Appetizer."" We went with the three choice option for $16.99: Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Chicken Wonton Tacos (which comes with 3), and the Boneless Wings. As for my entree, I ordered the Caprese Mozzerella Chicken and my husband ordered the Double Crunch Shrimp plate. So, let's begin the review: Spinach and Artichoke Dip: The chips were a bit too oily for me, but the dip was actually pretty good. Some bits of chunky artichoke in there, and well seasoned. It came out warm enough for me to enjoy with the chips. Chicken Wonton Tacos: Disappointing. You get that Thai tangy chili sauce in the taco, little chunks of chicken, slaw and cilantro mix in a wonton shell. The shell was a bit oily, but edible. But, I was not impressed. Boneless Wings: We opted for the Classic Buffalo Sauce. The plate came out cold and the food at room temperature. You can either choose Ranch or Bleu Cheese. We asked for both and got Ranch. It also comes with celery sticks, if you're wondering. Caprese Mozzerella Chicken: I was pretty excited about this, but was sorely disappointed. The mashed potatoes were meh. The chicken was cooked well but also meh. All-in-all, I was not impressed. If you've ever noticed the temperature of your dish at the end of your dinner, well, that's how it was when I got my plate. Room temperature. Like it was sitting for a bit.  Double Crunch Shrimp: Well, I didn't try this. But my husband had two pieces of his shrimp and a couple pieces of his fries and the he stopped eating it. He was not pleased. He did enjoy the slaw though. If you're a slaw lover like he is, he recommends the cole slaw. I imagine my dish would be a little better had it come out warm and fresh, rather than tasting like it had been sitting out in the kitchen for a bit before being brought out to me. I'm not super picky, but when every single dish that comes out is at room temperature when it should actually come out, at the very least, warm, is not acceptable. Might possibly be a one-time thing. Might not be. I'm sure there are die-hard Applebee's fans, but I can't say I'm one of them. They've got a lot of other options that may just be hidden gems in the menu, but it was a miss for me. On the flip side: the prices are reasonable, the location is convenient, I bet they've got a great selection of mixed drinks, and the staff is pleasant.

As soon as you walk in you get greeted by two girls with messy I brushed buns plopped on their head with some pretty nasty facial expressions. She proceeded to ask me how much people were in my party I said two then she asked table or booth I said table she then told me it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait which was fine !!!! We decided to walk around for a bit cane back in maybe 10 minutes we waited for about 15 minutes you could see literally half of the restaurant with open tables. I then walked over to let her know that either table or booth was fine ( because she asked my preference on seating) and she snaps back and says oh well we were told we can't sit anyone else because the kitchen is backed up. So then we proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes while all the workers were talking story and laughing. Tables were filled with dirty plates and rubbish and you can't say they were understaffed because I'm sitting in the restaurant  at this very moment writing this review and there are over 8 servers working. As we came to our table it was not cleaned expected that) our waitress is kind we ordered our appetizers and once again they were DELICIOUS even better than chillis in my opinion lol the time that it took to arrive was decent food was hot. Back to the workers you can literally hear them talking shit about their customers to each others it's quite pathetic and that is a NO NO working in customer service. More servers and workers are walking around with HUGE cellphones hanging out of their back pockets which look totally unprofessional. You're at work put your phones in your bags ESPECIALLY when you work in a restaurant.

Burger came and it was ground beef, loads of garlic mixed in, and falling apart.  There was a slice of tomato and a small piece of mozzarella cheese on top.  No basil, no balsamic.  At this point, my friend was done her meal, so I just ate what I had while we waited for the check.   I was extremely disappointed in the meal as a whole.  I probably will not go back to Applebee's, which is a disappointment.  I like visiting them on the mainland, so I was thrilled when this location opened close to my home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

80,Kat N.,"Pearl City, HI",14,2,,2.0,2018-01-07,Went here for lunch and Our utensils were really dirty. There was actual leftover food on one of the spoons and the other spoon was sticky. I had caprese chicken and the flavor was sour and bland. Our daughter spilled a full glass of soda and it went all over the floor. No one put up a caution sign and other staff kept waking over it and they kept seating customers. I had to warn someone everyone they walked past. I even asked if they had a sign which I believe is standard for safety reasons and they had to go look for it. When the guy came to mop it up the mop water was stinky and I just lost my appetite. I'm hoping this is just for to them getting there hand off things since they just opened up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
83,AnnaAndnoli E.,"Aiea, HI",56,1,,1.0,2018-01-08,Service was ok but the worst part and it's very alarming is charging my credit card aside twice one that I signed for and a second one I didn't sign or aware of the amount of. I called and spoke to a mgr named Rebekah and said she'll take care of it and take out the charge but 3wks past and still no refund on the charge that I didn't even authorize for.

42,Maloury M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",60,8,2.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"Came in on Thursday for dinner, party of 3. Service was good. Wait time for food was kinda long. Nearby tables were not cleaned for at least 15 minutes after people left (not sure when our neighboring tables were cleaned because they were still full when we left). Must be short on bussers that night.  Ordered the AYCE chicken tender special, only got the chicken and fries. Had to ask for sauce and no coleslaw like the picture shows.  Didn't notify the server(My fault I know, I was starving and didn't wanna cause a fuss or wait any longer for food).  Overall, We'll give then another try in the future. The prices are not bad (our food actually came out fresher then other reviewers,  Not super greasy or cold).  We like having another dining option nearby. Fingers crossed that things get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
11,Ashlie L.,"Pearl City, HI",10,6,7.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"Came here for a late lunch today with my friend at about 3pm. It wasn't too crowded. We were greeted and sat right away. Our sever came shortly after, introduced herself and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was really tasty and refreshing. We both shared appetizers, wonton chicken tacos and the spinach and artichoke dip. Tacos were good, the wonton didn't have that burnt flavor, it wasn't soggy. The chicken kind of had a BBQ taste to it, and the veggies were really crisp. The spinach artichoke dip was CHEESY. Pretty good but CPK might have beat them on that one. For the entree, my friend got the four cheese Mac and cheese with honey peppered chicken(she wasn't that stoked about it), and I got the 3 cheese chicken Cavatappi, it wasn't great, I also had to add some salt. Our server was really nice, but there were times where she forgot to bring stuff. Understandable though, a new restaurant still needing staff. All in all I would come back to this location, maybe order something different next time. Additional side note, it's VERY CLEAN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

47,Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",416,233,702.0,3.0,2018-01-09,"During a trip to the mall, my son and I stopped in for a quick lunch. The wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes, so we decided to try and sit at the bar. There was only one seat left but the hostess was nice and got us another chair. We were greeted by the bartender and quickly placed our order. The menu has a lot of options at reasonable prices. We opted for 2 appetizers for 12.99 and chicken tenders. Since we didn't order a lot, I figured our food would come out pretty quickly. To my dismay, our order did take some time. The bartender apologized for the wait time. My son and I didn't mind so much as we were busy watching the football game on tv. The food was good and what one would expect from a bar/grill type restaurant. All in all, I'd say I'd come back to try their menu items and for more appetizers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

51,Colin H.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,2,,1.0,2018-01-10,"Can't believe how terrible the service is for a new place.  Waited 15 minutes because John one knew who was the server for our table. Then took our drink order, and didn't get that till another 15 minutes. We decided to be patient and just order our food. Big mistake, our food was under the warmer for a while because the cole slaw was hot and the mac-n-cheese was hard.  We noticed others were not getting served too. They actually went up to ask if anyone was going to serve them.

41,Barry W.,"Kaneohe, HI",13,179,19.0,2.0,2018-01-13,"The short version: You can do better. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but some in our party were excited about a couple of all you can eat specials and so off we went. We were told the wait was 20-25 minutes, so we signed in and waited for a table. And waited. And waited. It was a ludicrously long wait with tables seemingly available.  After about nearly an hour, someone in our party went to find out what in the world was going on. Others who were waiting had begun to inquire about the open tables, and the hostess said that they were understaffed and didn't have enough servers to seat anyone at those tables. Seriously? That would have been a good bit of information to have about 45 minutes ago! They seated us shortly thereafter (I think they realized they had forgotten about us), and our waitress was pleasant. We ordered: ayce riblets, ayce chicken tenders, and a sirloin steak. Everything was... okay. Not very flavorful but not off-putting. One of the plates of riblets was small, overcooked, and clearly substandard; it never should have left the kitchen. When we noted that it looked... unimpressive, the server said, ""Well, you can always order more."" SMH. And that pretty much summed it up. This was a mediocre meal with very poor customer service. I would have given it one star, but our waitress was pretty nice and really /was/ trying. But I don't need to ever eat here again. Parking was free in the mall parking lot, but finding the restaurant was more difficult than expected with a GPS. We actually called to find out where it was, and still had to hunt around.  Bottom line: There are better options at this price point. The similarly priced and nearby Chili's is far superior. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aiea,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
