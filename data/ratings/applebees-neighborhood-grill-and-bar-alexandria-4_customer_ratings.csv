91,Brandon R.,"Washington, DC",71,82,200.0,1.0,2012-01-21,"We walked in and found a 70-year-old man wiping off menus inside the front door. I was certain he wasn't the host because he didn't acknowledge our presence.  I waited about ten seconds before clearing my throat. ""Ahem."" He looked up, annoyed. ""Two,"" I said. ""Table for two."" ""Well, let me go see if I can find a table."" I laughed out loud. I seriously thought he was joking. WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS IN THE RESTAURANT. EVERY TABLE WAS EMPTY. ""NO,"" he snapped. ""See all these tables? We don't have a waitress for every table! Stay here."" He slowly--very slowly--shuffled to the very back corner of the restaurant, and stared at a booth for a few seconds. Then he slowly--very slowly--shuffled back. Without saying a word, he grabbed two menus and walked again (slowly) to the table. We followed him and sat down. As it turns out, I was right. He wasn't the host. He was the manager. Wow. That encounter pretty much sums up our experience here. Though we were the only ones here (at 8:00 on a Monday night) it took 40 minutes to get our food.  As we were leaving, I passed the manager, still wiping off menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=80,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003
45,Marcus A.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,49,6.0,2.0,2012-03-20,"Recently I went with some of my friends to Applebee's.  Usually Applebee's is a favorite amongst us, but this time none of us was impressed.  It started out when we first walked in.  There was a man (the manager?) who was standing at the front of the restaurant, looked at us and didn't have the decency to even greet us.  Finally someone came and sat us down.  Once we sat down our table was noticeably sticky.  It took asking 3 times before the table was finally cleaned.  At this point we are leery of the service.  Once we ordered our food, the food was actually good and probably the saving grace because our waitress rarely came back to check on us and did not keep up with our refills.  Needless to say this was a very underwhelming visit.  I'm not sure what the problem is with this restaurant but I sensed a horrible vibe from the staff.  This was definitely not a place that I would want to come back to.  They have lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=100,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004
57,Tyler R.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,222,58.0,1.0,2012-04-23,"What a surprise- I found myself at an applebees on a Friday night in Alexandria, VA. This was not your typical Applebee's, or maybe it is. We entered looking for a seat at the bar. Seeing that it was full, we took seats at a table adjacent. The server was polite and took our drink orders quickly.  That's when the excitement happened. First, a large group entered and was seated around us (four to one side and one person to the other). This influx of people must have attracted much attention. A man peddling balloon animals approached their table as a Kevin Costner movie (during a soft core scene) played in the background. He made two large heart-shaped flowers for the women at the nearby table. This happened while I waited for my salad and beer.  Unfortunately, the woman seated at our left had an undercooked burger, and she made it well known. The manager came over, and it just so happened to be the balloon animal artist! His presence drew my attention to the bar where he was stationed. There sat a man worth a glorious mullet flirting with a waitress. Clearly this place had everything. The salad I had was fine, though over dressed (they did use sesame oil or sesame flavor in the dressing) and over priced ($11) for a lot of lettuce and sliced almonds with crispy chicken bits sprinkled about.  I was left underwhelmed, so I took advantage of their half price appetizers and ordered onion rings.  They came, but were first served to the table next to us by a waitress who had her purse and was leaving for the night. When they got to the right place, it turned out there were a few shrimp mixed in. The onion rings themselves were pretty bad- all deep fried breading and no onion. The BBQ sauce served with it was sugary and awful. Thankfully, there was Heinz ketchup on the table.   As I finished the onion rings, I requested the check. The woman to our left received her re-cooked burger as I signed. She proclaimed it was still raw, and my friend and I decided it was prime time to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=60,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

We were seated quickly, even though there were 5 others ahead of us, and were promptly met by our Server within just a few minutes. Service was really above average, and the food came fast hot and delicious. The kids were having a ball, and Mom and Dad got to eat a meal that wasn't Hamburger Helper or grilled cheese sandwiches. I have to say that I'm a big fan of the regular and boneless hot wings with the spicey sauce. But I have to admit that they also do a pretty good job with the Buffalo Wing sauce as well.

This patron's opinion of dining here both validated my fears, and proved to be a somewhat unpleasant experience compared to other Applebee's in the region! Although I obviously don't pretend to have tried everything on the menu, what limited portions I and those with me did have, showed that their food preparation, cooking and attention to detail and quality, did not hit the mark, although the service was fairly good, it appeared to me overall to be short of adequate, to say the least!

49,Michael C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,88,62.0,2.0,2013-04-20,"This is the most accurate, precise, and unbiased review for Applebee's at the 6310 Richmond Highway location.  First of all, I am not new to Applebee's.  I have been to several across the United States and even one outside the United States.  For the most part I have had great experiences.  Their Bourbon Street Steak is one of the greatest entree's in this restaurant category - when prepared correctly of course.  But this isn't about the past.  This is about today. I ordered my food for Curbside To Go today and one of the entrees was the 9 oz House Sirloin with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  During the call my order was taken and was even recommended to get the 2 for $20 deal since I put in orders for 2 separate meals.  The other was Chicken Penne.  Anyways, I was told 15 minutes and I got there in 18 minutes.  I noticed that unlike every other Applebee's, they don't ask you for the color or make of your car.  You see, in most Applebee's, they actually come out to your car.  That is the entire point of Curbside To Go.   Well, I didn't sit out in my car waiting like a doofus.  It was obvious that I had to walk in myself.  I noticed the place was about half full but had a musty smell.  Looked very old and dim.  Keep in mind this was at 2:40pm on a Saturday where it is super sunny outside.  The bartender got my order and I checked out.  All is good right?  WRONG! Before I say what's wrong, let me tell you that I'm cutting for the summer so I obviously have the worst nightmare to all restaurant chains that give meal sizes in terms of weight - a digital scale!  As I look at my supposedly ""9 oz"" steak, it looks really small.  It must be the most dense steak in the history of cows or I just got hosed.  I take the steak and place it on my scale (that is tared already) and what does it read?  5.35 oz!!!  I kid you not.  So I'm thinking maybe they charged me for a 7 oz steak and the cook got a really fatty piece and maybe he cut it a little short.  WRONG!  I was charged for a 9 oz.  It makes me wonder what a 7 oz would look like?  A chicken nugget?   I just ate everything and so far so good.  Who knows what will happen later.  All I know is that I was expecting 9 oz.  Now I'm going to have to fix a protein shake to make up for the loss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=60,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.6080000000000003

30,Marianne L.,"Alexandria, VA",225,620,330.0,2.0,2013-11-30,"We had a good meal here and will probably be back as Mom likes them and there are none where she lives (plenty of tv ads though). But a somewhat shady experience when the bill came is costing a 3rd star, and likely will for continued visits. Bottom line - add up your bill. Make sure the total at the far away bottom is actually what it should be - and watch out for hinky explanations from the management. After catching an afternoon flick, Mom wanted to come here for dinner. I did give the menu an advance scouting to make sure I could fine something that would fit in with my healthier eating habits (hey, at least I try) but it's Mom so of course we're going to go here if she wants to. We greeted upon entering and the hostess kindly took notice of our request to be seated away from the arctic tundra that was the entry way to a nice booth on the non-bar side of the restaurant, where we might actually be able to see what we were eating. Our friendly waiter joined us to take our drink order a few minutes later and to see if we were ready to order or had questions. Mom opted for the 4-cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. Sometimes you just got to love your Mom who chooses the one thing on the menu you're dying to have - but won't because you simply know what a nutritional catastrophe its bound to be. So she ordered it and I got to try it :-)  Works for me. I ordered the garlic sirlion (rare - expecting at best to receive med-rare).  We also  indulged in some Green Bean Crispers, one of my favorite apps - if not the healthiest of selections :-) Our entrees came and sadly my steak was very well done, couldn't have gotten a drop of juice out of it if I tried. I flagged the waiter down and let him know. Every business handles this situation a bit different - and I could see the waiter struggling for a moment not wanting to leave one patron with nothing to eat while the other dined or their meal got cold. I was always taught the proper thing was to replace the entire dish - since the sides are meant to be eaten with the main. But the waiter took away my steak only, leaving the mushroom and and roasted red potatoes. In short order, a nice rare sirloin arrived back at the table. Everything was fine until the check arrived. Mind you, I'd never once asked that my meal be comped so I was quite surprised to see that directly below the line for my steak dinner, the value had been deducted. Problem was - after I scanned down through 5+ inches of nonsense about gift cards, diner survey numbers, and whatnot - there to my surprise at the bottom of the slip was the total not up at the top under the itemized order.  This is a bit weird. I'm not an infrequent dinner and am used to inches of nonsense that I immediately ignore but that all usually comes AFTER the part that belongs on the check in the first place. I'm glad I'm good at doing math in my head as the total was far too high for 1 entree, 1 app and 2 drinks. The 2nd entree that had been deducted at the top was mysteriously added back in at the bottom.  The waiter was perplexed, understanding immediately that the bill clearly wasn't right. So he brought the manager over and quickly explained the problem. The manager gave some song and dance about it wasn't a comp that is how the corrected order had to be put into the kitchen. I call BS, though I clearly don't know how Applebee's POS system works. But if the order had to be put in again and then backed out so the kitchen would know to refire 1. why did the plate not come out complete (OK the waiter may have stuck his head in and said meat only), but of more concern 2. why weren't there 2 orders for my entree on the bill and one backed out. Frankly I think they tried to make it look like they'd comped it hoping I wouldn't notice that it was sneakily stuck back in way at the bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.024,2.12

It was Applebee's and I did not have high expectations and those low expectations were met. Nothing was outright bad - neither the food nor the service - but nothing was very good either. I had a Reuben sandwich and a salad. They were fine. It is hard to screw up a Reuben but it is easy to not add any character to it. It was not what you would call good, but also not bad. It filled my belly. That is about all I can say for it. The service was slow, considering it was past the lunch rush and I was one of perhaps ten customers. I won't be back unless I end up with another gift card on a day I forgot to bring lunch to work. Funny - I once dated a woman who LOVED Applebee's and thought it was a great place.

We decided to adopt her into our little family. My mom calls her niece. We don't get her all the time, and we used to be sad when we couldn't get her. It's hard to make that kind of relationship with a waiter.  The first thing I found out was that even when we do not have her, we are still having a great time. The food comes out great, and my drink never empties. The manager Ray has been there for as long as I can remember. If your having a concern, speak with him and he will see that everything turns out ok. We have gone so many times that we must have used at least all of the waiters by now.

While we waited, we listened to the servers curse and argue, good times. Another 15 minutes goes by and our food arrives, all except for my wife's food. I also ordered a salad that never came, but at this point I let it go. I waited until my food was cold to ask the server (who spent the whole time at the register) about my wife's food. He came back to say they forgot about it and he would wrap it to go and take it off the bill. It came out swiftly...on a plate, not wrapped.

73,Adam E.,"Poneto, IN",0,23,5.0,4.0,2016-12-27,"Upon entering the establishment, I noticed the floor. It was not clean, nor was it dirty. It was a simple floor. The booth in which I was promptly seated had a rather noticeable and large scratch on the side of it, forcing me to Sit on the inside. Upon taking a detour to inspect the men's facility, my nose was vilely assaulted by a putrid aroma emanating from one of the waste disposal machines. As far as staffing is concerned, The waitress remembered my order from nearly a year ago. However this event took place before before I was a expert yelp critic. So it will not positively or negatively impact the final score . I arrived just before lunch hour, so the floor was noticeably underwhelming. Therefore the agonizing wait for a simple glass of water is simply inexcusable. my drink eventually arrived, thus the agonizing wait for my appetizer begins.  Agonizing is most certainly the correct word I could've possibly used to describe to use to describe the wait for my appetizer, this would have been most certainly a deduction, if not for the simply exquisite and outstanding taste brought on by The food. My entre was brought out in a similar fashion as the rest of my food.overall this is a wonderful place to patron. Unfortunately the wait times for everything was enough to deduct a star from the overall outcome. I had to simply wrestle with the pepper shaker in order to get a simple spurt.

I decided to try the Applebees I've driven past for years. It was inedible and I regularly exist on food that I can microwave. We ordered the Bourbon Street Steak with Crispy Red Potatoes and a Triple Chocolate Meltdown to share. The steak looked like roadkill that had baked in the sun for months; it was placed on a bed of slimy, onions and mushrooms floating in a puddle of grease. I had to inspect the mound of filaments to distinguish the mushrooms from the onions. The red potatoes were dry and shriveled.The chocolate dessert was stale and would be a distant second to a hostess cupcake on its best day. The vanilla ice cream we did eat but didn't enjoy...I can only describe it as cheap tasting. I picked up this order yet still experienced crappy service. I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes but was not acknowledged. I then asked a server where to pick up food and was told to ask the bartender. I then waited at the vacant bar for a few minutes and stared at a group of employees chatting while the packaged food was on the bar aging further.
