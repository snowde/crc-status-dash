8,P. Rachelle L.,"Edwardsville, IL",1,3,,3.0,2012-03-22,"I have been to this Applebees before and received amazing service. A group of us went recently on a Wednesday night. It took them a few minutes to seat us but we didn't mind waiting since there were quite a few of is and we had anticipated having to wait. We got our table and were still waiting on a few stragglers to show up. The waiter came out and asked if this was all and we said that we were still waiting on a few more to show up. So he turns and walks away. He comes about ten minutes later and asks if we are still waiting. We say yes, but can we go ahead and get our drinks. He was very rude when he said he was getting ready to do that. He took our drink orders but was very rude to each of us when asking what we wanted. The rest of our people showed up and asked if they please could order. (They figured the rest of us had ordered) He said nobody has ordered yet and walked away. He finally came back and got our meal orders. He seemed very irritated when he was serving our food. Anther waitress was trying to help him get us our food and was trying to calm him down. She was very pleasant and nice. The food was okay. There wasn't much sauce on my honey bbq wings even though I had asked for extra saucy. This must have just been an off night for the restaurant. Nothing was great about it. The waitress was nice but everything else was very lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
6,Phil G.,"East Alton, IL",0,3,1.0,5.0,2013-11-09,We came here to celebrate our good news. A manager overheard we were having a boy and sent us complimentary desserts. Very sweet. Professional staff. Clean and organized eatery.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,

7,Alan W.,"Jerseyville, IL",20,16,9.0,2.0,2014-06-13,"Service was ok. Food was so so. Told the manager they needed to change the grease in the fryers. Fried green beans had a bad taste. Bartender was slow and did not impress me with ""New"" Perfect Margarita.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
4,Pete S.,"Jerseyville, IL",0,12,7.0,3.0,2016-03-21,Stopped in for a late lunch with wife. I had the quesadilla  burger and fries. Burger was decent  but a bit sloppy and the fries were hot and delicious.   Wife had 3 cheese pasta with chicken.   Bit bland had to add some salt n pepper but she enjoyed it. Our service  was great and Eddie  was on it.  Hope to see him at our next  visit   lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
3,Angie C.,"Godfrey, IL",9,8,,2.0,2016-03-23,"In short food, service, cleanliness and experience are all...meh.  Then again,  it's Applebee's so what else should you expect?   Something the kids will eat when you don't feel like cooking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
2,Jake R.,"Carrollton, IL",2,44,39.0,3.0,2016-06-23,Eh... it's ok but not the best one around. We prefer the Jacksonville store for quality. Food was ok service was good and prompt but the hostess was.... a lil rude after we sat in the bar area without asking lol. We thought it was seat yourself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
1,John B.,"Grafton, IL",0,10,,1.0,2017-12-09,I can't even give this place 1 star it is a hole.   I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp my wife had the steak the food was garbage.  It's evident the cooks don't care I had no shrimp with my chicken and when I asked the server who was good brought out a side of 5 small burned shrimp. The chicken was dry and my wife's steak was over cooked to rubber.  This is the worst Applebee's I have ever been in the manager Anne cooks don't give a shit about food quality or service I would avoid it at all costs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alton-2,,,,,
