8,Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63,4.0,2014-07-03,"I would consider myself a regular at this place. My friends and I usually go in the late evening when they have half priced appetizers. (We all enjoy not having to pay a whole lot!) We often go during trivia nights and just hang out. Very relaxed atmosphere.  The hosts and wait staff have always been friendly and the bartenders get to know you by name. I've never had a bad experience here.  Some of my favorite appetizers include the crispy green beans (they are not half price after 9/10pm, but they are quite tasty) and the white queso dip and tortilla chips. The boneless wings are decent. I'm not the biggest fan of their wings, I find them to be pretty average. Nothing special. The potato twisters is another good option as an appetizer. It's basically potatoes very thinly sliced into curls and deep fried. It's quite a large portion too. Two or more can share easily. Sometimes, however, not all of the potatoes get fried completely and when that happens those pieces are not so good. Don't let that deter you though, they are tasty. There's also burger sliders, which in honestly taste like mini Big Macs. If you're into that kind of thing, go for it. Another tasty option is the pub pretzels and beer cheese. However, it's salty. So if you don't like a lot of salt, steer clear of this. Lastly, I also enjoy getting the chicken wanton tacos.  They use wantons to create little mini tacos... Hence the name. They are as cute as they are refreshing. Just don't get these to-go. I can tell you from experience that they will not be hot and crunchy when you get around to eating them.  Other than the appetizers, the oriental chicken salad is superb! You can order it with grilled or crispy chicken- I usually order crispy chicken, adds more of a crunch. It comes loaded with lettuce, cabbage, my favorite lo mein noodles, and they top it off  with a sweet dressing that complements the rest of the salad perfectly. Other than that they have your typical burgers, pasta dishes, seafood dishes... Typical restaurant chain dishes. I will warn you, they do not go easy on salt! Maybe consider requesting your meal unsalted if you don't like a lot of salt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
11,Julie C.,"Hollidaysburg, PA",0,20,2,2.0,2014-07-16,"Met a friend for lunch on her hour lunch break. We both opted for the lunch menu, figuring it would be relatively speedy since it's advertised to be a ""lunch"" thing. Took almost 40 minutes for us to get our food. Then we asked for our check immediately so we could pay immediately and wolf down our food before having to take off. The waiter, who was far less than attentive, ran both bills through on my debit card, even though we had both asked for separate bills then provided separate debit cards for the bills. Eventually spoke to a manager over the phone after being told to call back later because they were too busy. The GM was pleasant, apologized, and said she'd rectify the situation. Appreciative of a good GM, but the staff definitely needs work!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
6,Rachel K.,"Barcelona, Spain",411,215,108,2.0,2014-09-22,"I usually like Applebee's, but this location kinda sucked, to be honest. I came here with my boyfriend and a few friends for a late dinner. The wait was around 20 minutes, so we just used the time to walk around the mall a bit. Our waitress was nice, but the service was ridiculously slow. Close to 30 minutes had passed before she even took our drink order. We had to wait equally as long for our drinks to arrive, food to arrive, etc. Also, the plates and silverware that the waitress brought out were really dirty, as in, caked with food. It's pretty dark inside and it was still easy to notice. Our waitress's response? ""Ew!"" Enough said there. Like any other Applebee's, the food was decent. My boyfriend and I got the 2 for $20 appetizer and entree deal and our tummies were happy.  All in all, I probably wouldn't return here unless I was at the Logan Valley Mall and too hungry for an Auntie Anne's Pretzel to hold me over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
9,Matthew B.,"Altoona, PA",0,43,1,2.0,2015-08-26,Used to love coming out too altoona's Applebee's after a long day of cooking myself and I have to say the food quality has really gown downhill idk if it's management or the cooks but food quality def needs Q-A'd more closely!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
5,Shelly S.,"Altoona, PA",48,77,7,5.0,2016-06-01,"This is our place to go on Wednesday nights after work. The staff knows us by name and usually knows what we want.  We get half off appetizers, the boneless hot wings and fried cheese. We share them, then we usually all get burgers. I LOVE their burgers! Share a dessert or 2, depending on how many friends show up.  We always have a great time, trivia on Wednesday nights. Great staff, that treats you right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
2,Ronnie T.,"Hyattsville, MD",51,73,50,5.0,2016-07-24,"This place has always been one of my go to restaurants for any late evening with friends that consists of hunger. I would definitely consider myself a regular at this Applebees.  I'm always satisfied with how speedy and consistent the service is at this restaurant, considering the large amount of customers that are typically present. My go to food is the half off appetizers and I typically order the boneless wings which are pretty delicious and theycome in a wide array of flavors. I also order the salsa and chips, wonton tacos, and mozzarella sticks.  The portions are always plentiful and the food always comes out piping hot. For a college student this place is a automatic go-to, considering how reasonable the prices are in addition to the quality of food. I have not been disappointed once! Cheers to good eats!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
7,Joe K.,"Northern Cambria, PA",0,3,1,4.0,2016-08-02,"Service and apps were great, but the main course was meh. We visited right before the end of their appetizer happy hour between 4pm-6pm. We ordered buffalo boneless wings, chicken quesadillas, cheese sticks, and nacho's with salsa. The apps were all very good except for the salsa it was like flavored water and the flavor was sh*t. I was in the mood for something other than the usual steak I always get, which is the bourbon steak that they took off the menu. I ordered a new item which is chicken and grilled shrimp with potatoes. It looked delicious when it arrived to the table, but with the first bite of my chicken I knew that they had over seasoned it with this garlic stuff that honestly looked like guacamole. I was with my mom and she ordered a steak extra, extra well done (leather) and she loved it. They get 4 stars for the great service, apps, and steak, but I suggest to not stray from those items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
0,Segan F.,"Coalport, PA",0,9,4,5.0,2016-11-07,Up to par with most Applebee's! This is my daughter's favorite place to eat because she likes to visit Tilt Studios after.  I love their menu options and this summer their grill menu was amazing!  Seating for large groups can be an issue and they do not take reservations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
4,Chelsea K.,"State College, PA",8,17,12,5.0,2016-12-05,We stopped in for a drink before going shopping and Mary was great. She gave great suggestions and helped us with what to shop for here!! Great drink suggestions and just a super friendly fun person to talk to! Wish she was a bartender everywhere we went! Just a super awesome friendly personality! Hope she stays around for the next time we're in town!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
3,Ingemann N.,"Manhattan, NY",13,129,13,4.0,2017-02-11,"My daughter and I came through the town to pick up a cat... Applebee's is often a safe bet when visiting new places and traveling with kids. It was not clear from the Yelp directions that this was inside the mall, but after having toured the parking lot we finally found it, and after a modest wait we got seated. The food was good (upper range of my Applebee's experience); the service was very friendly, and even though the place was busy, we got our food fast enough. We would go back if we are in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
1,Alex S.,"Altoona, PA",40,268,69,3.0,2017-12-03,"This is your typical Applebee's, with mediocre service that's usually hit or miss, depending on the days and times that you go. My last time here, our server seemed friendly, but in one of those ways where he's just trying to be friendly to earn a tip. I think the only time our dedicated server was at our table was to bring us drinks and take our food order. We had a different person bring us our appetizer and a different person bring us our entrees, and it was about 4:15 on a Sunday. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an app, but it took almost 20 minutes to come out to us, and then we got our main courses 5 minutes later. It wasn't busy at all, so I don't know what the issue was. The food tasted good, though, so that's ultimately what I base most of my rating off of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-altoona-4,,,,,
