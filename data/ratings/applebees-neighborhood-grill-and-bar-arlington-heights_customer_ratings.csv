9,Tracy L.,"East Dundee, IL",1,3,5.0,1.0,2012-01-28,Don't come to this place!  We came after a basketball tournament and they clearly didn't want us.  I called ahead and told them 20 people were coming.  The service staff disappeared and our food took hours.  They even missed two of the lunches and they never gave us an apology.  They don't have their A- team working today!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
10,Terri L.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",1,8,,5.0,2012-02-20,I have come here repeatedly and have never had a problem.  The food is great and the atmosphere is comfortable.  The service is always great.  Perhaps they've made improvements... their manager always stops by and asks customers if he can do anything for them.  At any rate it's been great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
4,Jeff W.,"Chicago, IL",125,116,12.0,2.0,2012-05-09,"I got a $25 gift card to Applebee's for Christmas 2010 and it's been in my car ever since. I forgot my lunch for work and this Applebee's is nearby so I dusted off the card and have been here twice in the past 2 weeks.  First time, I got the blackened steak penne - Blackened steak over penne pasta with fresh spinach, bruschetta and creamy Alfredo. This was typical to any chain, nothing special but a healthy serving that probably should have lasted 2 meals. The strips of steak were tasty. Today I got the pick n' pair lunch for $6.99. I got their Fried Green Tomato & Turkey Club with their daily soup special, spicy corn chowder. The club wasn't half bad, shaved turkey breast on toasted 9 grain bread with cheese, basil pesto mayo, bacon and fried green tomatoes. To note, the presentation was depressing as hell, half my sandwich in a big white Styrofoam box with no garnishes whatsoever. Thought it was funny.  The soup, on the other hand, was just bad. Who thought it would be a good idea to put the blue corn tortilla chips in the soup prior to packaging?? Places like Chili's put the garnishes on the side, and for good reason! Nothing worse than soggy tortilla strips with every bite. Taste just wasn't good either. Not a fan.  Both times, the dining room was kind of gloomy. Old people galore and the customer service was pretty sub par. Today, it seemed like none of the staff wanted to greet me and the bartender (busy maybe?) yelled for somebody to help me.  Long story short, I gave them a generous tip of whatever money was left on my gift card for the sake of not having to come back. Skip this Applebee's and opt for so many better choices nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
12,Mike J.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,27,,4.0,2012-07-02,We come here often and almost always get the two for $20 combo.  We're steak fans and the steak here is excellent (especially for the price with apps).  The food sometimes takes a little longer than you'd expect (we try to avoid the rush hours) but so far no complaints about quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
3,Gregory B.,"Arlington Heights, IL",11,517,,2.0,2013-01-10,"Do people actually eat here by CHOICE? Chicken tortilla soup that tasted like it was made by androids for robots.  I asked for a Turkey Reuben and I might as well have asked the server for a plutonium milkshake.  She must have repeated her confused question six times.  My final answer: ""Yes, just EXACTLY like a regular Reuben but this one gobbles.""  It really wasn't too horrible.  But I have had to eat at an Applebee's twice in a week now and I am not looking forward to doing it when I will be forced to again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
11,J S.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,63,8.0,2.0,2013-01-19,"Stopped in for dinner after a play. We sat in the bar area and was exposed to employees bad mouthing each other, complaining about each other.  Everyone seemed crappy.  Our server was ok.  He suggested a drink that was good but threw a slap at the bartender that she didn't understand his request. food was just ok, no big deal.  Will not be back..Many other restaurants and choices out there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
2,Charlotte T.,"Chicago, IL",45,68,11.0,2.0,2013-02-03,"My husband and I came to this Applebees location to kill some time between a wedding and the reception we were attending up the street. It is like the movie Waiting in here.   The bar tender was overwhelmed despite there only being a few people to serve at 4:00 in the afternoon and she was complaining to us about her bad day. Lady! I walked 1 mile wearing stilettos in the suburbs at a poorly planned wedding to order overpriced drinks at an Applebees! I don't want to hear your sob story.  The pretzels we ordered with our drinks came with a ""cheese sauce"" that clearly had been Alfredo sauce a few minutes before it arrived to us. The one redeeming quality is that alcohol still works in the suburbs. We ordered lots of it.  If this is what the suburbs have to offer, I am never leaving the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
0,Bunny K.,"Mt Prospect, IL",36,42,1.0,5.0,2013-02-09,"Went there for lunch with fam. Super friendly service. One of the servers was very funny, and made our lunch super fun.  Food was delish. We had the sampler appetizer and that alone could have been our entire meal. .. :) Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
5,Anna M.,"Germantown, TN",5,6,22.0,1.0,2013-06-03,I went here for a snack with friends at about 8 pm or so. The service was ok (nothing stellar but not horrible). I ordered the butter pecan blondie brownie. It's supposed to be served on a hot skillet with a cream sauce. The skillet was barely warm and the sauce was kind of stiff and congealed. Half of the brownie was hard too around the edges. I couldn't cut it with my fork or spoon. I wouldn't go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
7,Eddie O.,"Mt Prospect, IL",0,5,,5.0,2013-06-22,"This locaton is closing tomorrow (6/23),  and the staff is  still amazingingly professional and courteous. They have already run out of many items, but will try to fulfill our request with alternate selections. Most of the servers will be unemployed after tomorrow, but their positive attitudes are outstanding!! Thanks to the entire staff for your outstanding service thourought the years!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-arlington-heights,,,,,
