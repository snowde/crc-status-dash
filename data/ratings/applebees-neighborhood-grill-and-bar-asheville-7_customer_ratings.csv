14,Gina D.,"Dallas, TX",0,57,,4.0,2012-01-02,"Very good service on our visit here while vacationing in the area. The service from front door to waiter was exemplary, the manager even coming around to check in and see if everything was to our liking.       We had the chicken fingers and our server kindly brought us our requests for different sauces. The chicken is obviously not the very best variety, but then we didn't expect gourmet food at these prices.        We had no complaints. It was a very busy night, and we were treated well, and the food was as expected. Fries were very good, crisp and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
12,Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16.0,2.0,2012-08-16,"It's an Applebee's. The exact same as everywhere. You basically know exactly what you're getting when you go in there. My burger was overcooked and the waiter seemed to struggle with a few relatively simple concepts. But when you're dying for food and your fiance and you are considering shooting each other in a fit of hunger-rage, this place will work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
8,Manuel M.,"Asheville, NC",154,75,103.0,4.0,2015-04-25,Late night dinner. Not very busy but servicer was attentive. I had the new lime grilled chicken with quinoa and it was actually very tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
11,Joe M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",20,17,1.0,2.0,2015-05-22,"Food is ok, clientele is very country, I sat at the bar and service was pretty bad, very slow and unattentive. ..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
9,Jason M.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",29,16,21.0,5.0,2015-06-28,Good place for lunch sunday so alittle full but still service was quick drinks came fast aswell as food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
13,Kate S.,"Asheville, NC",0,1,,1.0,2015-10-20,"Dined here last night with my daughter and mom. Service was awful. Waited forever to get drinks. Server was not knowledgeable with menu. After placing order my mom's order didn't make it to the table. The server and manager never apologized for  the mistake, only stating that she doesn't know what what happened. The burger wasn't  cooked the way she wanted it but considering I was half way done and my daughter was done she didn't want to wait.  The manager never came by to check on us or did anything to the bill.  As a customer I will never be back. Very disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
10,Cricket H.,"Cary, NC",13,31,1.0,1.0,2015-12-26,The worst Apple B's I've ever been to. Food was cold.. beer hot.dirty..smelled awful. Nothing good but waitress. .BUT never told us her name.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
4,The-Pizza-Nazi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,157,10.0,2.0,2016-04-28,"Cmon......you earned low marks when I sat at the bar, which is 90% blocked by some ridiculous, massive beer dispensing thing, at chin level up.....so you are totally isolated from the bar.   Ridiculous to the point where it should be featured in some type of hospitality mag. under FAIL.  By the way, on that side of the bar, there are 6-7 seats.  This thing totally blocks you if you sit in 3 of them.  nearly 1/2 of one side of the bare is blocked off and useless.   Did Moe or Curly design this bar?? From there, and this is an Applebee's chain thing, not this place specifically, but there are next to zero vegetarian options.  EVERY restaurant has a meatless burger option, for several years. Not Applebee's.  cheese quesadilla?  nope! chili w/o meat?  nope.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
7,James H.,"Streeterville, Chicago, IL",1,2,,2.0,2016-07-30,"Do NOT order any of the seared burgers. You will be very disappointed when all you get is a burger with cheese on it. They will tell you that all the toppings are inside, but good luck seeing or tasting them. At least the manager was nice, and she took it off our bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
5,Geraldine P.,"Candler, NC",1,23,,2.0,2016-09-14,"They ended up charging us something like 200 dollars on our receipt because of a typo they made, which freaked us out because it was supposed to be only 20 something. Well, when we told our server he reacted with a big attitude and made a big fuss over the whole thing like we were trying to make a scandal out of the ordeal, when we just wanted our things. I got my husband a carry out doggy bag as well, and when I asked for a small cup of sour cream and butter they literally opened the plate and flung it in.  Now, the food was good for a chain, but really I can't excuse the decent food when the service was so poor. I have to say, it was quite sad. Not only that, but it was actually so bad that it upset me. I give it a two stars for food, and only that, but on every mark other than that including location, it's a big goose egg from me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
6,Gary L.,"Raleigh, NC",0,3,,3.0,2017-02-14,Not bad for a chain. Have been coming here off and on for about 10 years. Tonight was the best service I have had here at the bar in the 10 years. I do frequently sit at bars with my job so I might be extremely bias when it comes to service. Food was good but service was even better.  Only knock is i wish they would have gave thier names.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
1,Tina H.,"Asheville, NC",80,129,115.0,3.0,2017-03-03,I hardly drive by the Candler Applebee's when it isn't busy. That is probably because of the interstate exit.  Although I find the service to be friendly and the orders have all been correct. The food isn't amazing or bad.  It is average Applebee's food.  It's a chain.   I find the prices to be a little high for what you get and to be a chain.  They aren't locally sourcing their food (which would cost more). I actually had a long island iced tea a week or so ago and found it to be a good concoction. My favorite is their Maple Blondie.  It's been a favorite for a long time.  While the veggie pizza is long gone they still are serving their Maple Blondie 20+ years later.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
3,Angela C.,"Waynesville, NC",67,22,52.0,4.0,2017-09-10,"We frequently eat here especially for the half prized appetizers after certain times during the week.  Last night we had the friendliest waitress, I wish I could recall her name but she was very nice and very attentative.  Food is always good here as well.  I usually get their boneless wings and fries.  And we didn't have a long wait on food either.  We enjoy coming here, I recommend if you like the Applebee's chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
2,Stan J.,"McDonough, GA",4,39,,1.0,2017-10-08,Well I have not eaten in Applebees for 10 years.The past times I have tried Applebees the food always a disappointment. Today my aunt called said she wanted to meet at Applebees for lunch I said ok.The only thing I ordered was chips and salsa. The salsa taste like tomatoe paste.The chips had enough oil dripping  off them I could has changed oil in my car.The kicker was the oil they used to cook chips was old and spoiled.They do not deserve 1 star.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
0,A C.,"Plant City, FL",37,1,1.0,5.0,2017-12-31,"The service and food we're both good. We don't typically go to Applebee's because we prefer Chili's. But this one was close to our hotel and the roads were icy, so we didn't want to travel far. Because of the previous reviews, we only came because it was close. With that said, I'm glad we did. I had the wonton tacos, my husband had the brisket tacos and my daughter had the kids grilled cheese. All of which, were great. Would recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-asheville-7,,,,,
