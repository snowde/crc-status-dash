0,Valerie S.,"Aston, PA",143,668,802,3.0,2014-03-04,"Not a bad Applebee's but it's in a very lonely location - they could use some neighbors. For some reason, I find it kind of creepy that they're so isolated when there is plenty of room for other restaurants and whatnot to join them.  But I guess maybe they're trying to revamp the rest of Aston first (at least, that's what needs to happen!!!)   Anyway, we stop in here every so often.  I'm not quite as in love with their menu as I once was, but they do have good stuff there.  I love their spinach salad with the warm bacon dressing, and their Asian wonton tacos are really really tasty. I was pretty ticked off during my last visit though which was last week.  I was with my husband and our three girls and everyone's food came out at the same time except for my youngest daughter's - by the time she got her food (which was just their chicken and pasta alfredo type dish), the rest of us were almost done.  Of course, the whole time we were waiting, the rest of us were sharing our food with her, so by the time she got hers, she was already pretty full, so in hindsight, I really should have just told them to take it back and take it off the bill.  Anyway, it did make for a couple days of leftovers for her, but still, we were all pretty irritated. So I think I will stick to my ""once in a while"" routine of going to Applebee's, rather than the ""at least once a month"" like I used to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aston-4,,,,,
1,Karen F.,"Media, PA",2809,3911,7,2.0,2014-06-23,"Crapplebee's. My 9 year old loves it here - and thus, we sometimes go. Oddly enough her 9 year old BFF's fam loves it here, too - so again - we are dragged here. The service is actually pretty good if you come at an off- peak time (Crystal is a lovely server).  The food though?  Ech! The kiddo & I shared a Two for $20 deal and I added $1 extra to get the 7 oz (tiny) steak.  I asked for it rare and it had absolutely no flavor other than salt.  The steamed white rice and brocolli were sitting in a pool of water on the plate. Blech! The overly fried and greasy boneless wing app drenched in a sticky-sickly-sweet sauce was all I ate and that was bad enough. Lord help us! There are so many better places to eat.  I only come here under duress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aston-4,,,,,
