134,Gene K.,"New York, NY",81,167,3.0,3.0,2012-03-24,"I could give this Applebee's 4 stars or 2 stars.. depending what you talk about.  So I had a $30 gift card to use and came here for lunch... service was really good.  Hostess was friendly, cute and asked us where we wanted to sit...our waiter was on point the whole time.  He explained the menu when we asked and always stopped by to ask us if we needed anything or if the food was ok, etc... so they were awesome... excellent, excellent service!!!  The menu had a 2 for $20 deal and a 2 for $26 deal + free appetizer... so great value for eating out.   The downside is the food... rather blahhh.  We ordered the boneless chicken wings to start as appetizer.   Probably the worst wings I've had in years!!  Seriously, I mean if you went to your local supermarket and got microwave buffalo wings, they would taste better than these overly breaded and overly salty wings.   I got the Bourbon chicken and shrimp for my entree...very greasy, very salty.  Hard to taste the Bourbon spices described on the menu.  The chicken was better tasting than the shrimp, but then again, the shrimp were small and only 7-8 shrimps in total with potatoes and onions served on a hot skillet.  The presentation looked delicious, the food however was exceptionally blah.  Yes I know what youre thinking.... it's Applebee's and what do I expect for paying a 2 fo $20 meal, and i completely realize that! So that is why I'm giving 3 stars.   I guess it's an ok place if you're in the neighborhood like seeing a movie across the street at Kaufman theaters or on a tight budget to go out, but otherwise  I think I'd only come back to try their cheap drink specials during happy hours and avoid the food all together  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3?start=140,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.412,2.76

This location is good and convenient since it is right across the street from the movie theater. It's a cheap restaurant with decent food. I usually get the mozzarella sticks and boneless buffalo chicken wings for appetizers at these locations. I've also had the pasta, burger and fries, quesadilla, chicken fried chicken.

Even if I do teasingly refer to them as, ""Crapplebees"". I've been to this location twice, first on a movie/dinner date and second with my best friend. Did the 2 for $20 with the guy and the 2 for $26 with my bestie - definitely had a better time with her as the bartender on staff loved us and was AMAZING. We split their spinach and artichoke appetizer and for our entrees she had the spicy Cajun shrimp Alfredo pasta with garlic bread and I had the 9oz hangar steak cooked medium rare with a loaded baked potato (butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon - the WORKS!) and as for beverages it wasn't happy hour but our bartender's service skills were so superior that he comped us a few drinks here and there, made us delicious (and heavy handed!) cocktails that weren't on the drink menu (in large cups mind you) and didn't give us any sugary, sweet, stupid drinks - we spent a few hours at the bar supporting Team USA in the Olympics and enjoying our cocktails. My best friend and I went as far to call it our ""Saturday night rager in Applebees"". The restaurant manager even came over to check on us, see if we were being attended to well - we never felt rushed, never sat for more than 5 minutes with an empty glass and the food - while not the very best I've ever had, it's APPLEBEES, you don't expect the stars, but it was still tasty and and their ""2 for $20"" and ""2 for $26"" are great, reasonable and I've definitely had worse food. Oh, he even let us charge our cell phones at the bar - 5 stars for good food, good times, great bartending and for providing us with a better time than I thought we would have :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.484,2.88

Service was horrible on top of this as well.  We saw a manger walking around while we were in and even with empty glasses he just walked past us numerous times.  Staff is attentive because management isn't so I get that, but this really should be addressed.

The only things that really change are the location and faces of the restaurant. Now, there are a couple of pros to this particular Applebee's located in Queens. For example: 1. It is conveniently located across the street from the UA Kaufman Regal movie theater. Due to this, if you order an entree you can get discounted movie tickets for less than $10 each. That's a steal if you haven't seen the movie prices lately! 2. They always have amazing deals on appetizers and really good happy hour pricing. 3. The staff has always been nothing but friendly and attentive every time I've gone. From the servers to the bartenders everyone is laid back and looking out for the customer.

148,Hayleigh S.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,12,,2.0,2014-05-10,"I've been to this location numerous times simply because it's so close to the movie theater, so my fiance and I often eat here first before our movie dates. However, after a couple negative experiences, I think we'll opt for different restaurants from now on. In my experience the waiters and waitresses have always been really friendly, but the majority of times I've been here the service has been incredibly slow. When it's even the slightest bit busy it's difficult to get the attention of a waiter.  Food is consistently meh. We ordered the 2 for 20$ entrees, I got the oriental salad and he got the chicken tenders. My salad was 50% dried noodles with a couple shreds of lettuce underneath and quite literally swimming in salad dressing. His entree looked like they picked out the absolute smallest tenders they could find out of the batch, with a handful of fries. I don't know if smaller portions are just something to be expected with their 2 for 20$ deal but either way neither of us were satisfied. I think it's weird and annoying that you can only get the happy hour drink prices/half off appetizers if you're seated in the bar area. Any other restaurant/bar chain I've been to with similar specials has never made them bar-specific. Had I been able to get the happy hour deal, I would have gotten a couple beers. I opted for water instead. The only thing I can think of is that they don't want groups dining in for happy hour and only ordering a couple half off appetizers and drinks, but surely there are enough people who actually order off the regular menu as well to offset that. I've had better experiences at other Applebee's locations, but I'll probably avoid this one from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3?start=60,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.408,2.48

Appetizers very good; wings, chicken strips, poppers, etc. All standard bar food. Nothing to write home about, but when you are enjoying adult beverages; they hit the stop; good.

My girlfriend and I arrived at 1pm for your happy hour (1/2 off appetizers, $3 domestic drafts). I asked to order a Sam Adam Rebel IPA, which our server confirmed was actually a Bottle beer and would be $5. I changed my order to Sam Adams Winter Lager, which is a Draft, and brewed in the good ole USA. My girlfriend ordered a Blue Moon, from lovely Boulder Colorado. We continued to order Sam Adams and Blue Moons while eating a selection of your delicious appetizer offerings. When our bill arrived, we were surprised to see that we were actually charged $5 per beer. I figured it was a simple mistake. I brought it up to our server, who replied ""Sam Adams and Blue are ""expensive beers""."" Now I may be confused, which is why I took a picture of your menu to make sure it didn't say ""$3 cheap drafts"", which it of course didn't. I am very unhappy with this mislabeling of your services.

Please note that there was no caution sign and no other way to the restrooms. After waiting 15 minutes for a manager to appear, he began to explain how I needed to walk better to prevent the fall. Instead of becoming aggressive I simply asked him to please put a mat down as to prevent anyone else from having to experience this. I saw him tell a busboy to take the one slip free mat from the front entrance and put it in the area where the fall occurred. This now putting in danger any entering guests.

She then said that if we decided to change later that we would be stuck here. Great service you got there LOL! We fit perfectly btw..

We were told that no seats at the booth were available so we agreed to sit at one of the regular tables. As we made our way to the table, I saw PLENTY of booth seats that were empty. There must have been at least 10 vacant booth seats. Oh well, maybe they had a valid reason. Maybe there was a system in place. I let it be. We sat down and the hostess told us our server will be with us in a bit. We waited..and waited..and I started to get antsy. I voiced my discontent to my best friend and she said to wait just a bit longer... So we waited some more.. The server station is directly behind us and there were about 3-4 servers standing around and talking while putting in orders. We looked at them for a short while, hoping they'd get the signal and ask us if we have been helped or not. A few servers walked back and forth to our section... NOT ONE SERVER ever stopped to check on us. After what felt like a good enough amount of waiting time, my best friend asked, ""Do you want to just walk out and go to Uno's across the street?"" I hesitated for a second (thinking maybe we should wait just a bit longer), then my stomach reminded me that it needed to be fed and by this point, I was cranky. So we walked out and never looked back. I could have raised my hand and got their attention, but the fact that NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON even acknowledged us even after we looked around at them is unacceptable. We shouldn't have to be raising our hands for your attention. We even closed our menus to signal them that we are ready to order. Nope, that didn't work either.

They tasted reheated and not like the Applebee's quality I usually have. The ribs were horrible! Usually, at every Applebee's location, the ribs are cooked in the sauce. At this one, the ribs were hard, but, and had sauce THROWN ON TOP of them! That's something I've never seen before. I sent the food back, and the waiter owned up to the ribs looking different. She said that our ribs would be fresh again, but she comes back with the same ones! How can I tell? I can tell because of my own bite-mark from my ribs before!

Ordered it medium rare and as a previous review said it was more seared on outside but pretty bloody on inside, this is not a problem for me as I like my steak rare but if you dont I would advise getting it Medium. The steak itself was a bit veiny but I mean its a 10 buck steak at Applebees not Lugers so....the sauce was actually pretty good and it came with really good crispy red potatoes that were dusted with seasoning, some unnecessary sun dried tomatoes and one huge freaking piece of onion. For dessert I got the churro smores which was a plate of crunchy,warm churros and a little bowl of warm chocolate sauce with toasted Marshmellows on top. Pretty good but my sweater was cinnamon sugar dusted.     The service was a tad slow, our waitress was nice but she was often hard to find and they brought our entrees without knives and we had to fag her down for that and again when my friend needed a pepsi refill which was worse as I had to listen to him dramatically act ike he was on the Sahara!    They also have a tablet on the table which you can order desserts and drinks, pay bill with CC or flag down waitstaff (doesnt speed that up,you  just have to look at a mocking blinking light) but heres the problem with it, it offers a trivia game on there, now lets face it you see the trivia game and youre gonna play it. Well I dont know if there is a warning or if my friends just grabbed it without reading but after playing a few trivia games (which btw repeat questions!) we put it down and noticed a 1.99 charge on the bill for the game!

97,Jessica O.,"ASTORIA, NY",61,131,664.0,2.0,2015-12-09,"I came here with some friends on a Tuesday night after watching a movie at the UA Kaufman. It was just up the block and wheelchair accessible, otherwise I wouldn't have endorsed this trip. Despite the sparsely occupied restaurant, wait service was inconsistent. My friend and I ordered a blackberry sangria ($9.99) while I agonized over the entree. My sangria was so sweet it made me thirsty. If there was any alcohol in it I couldn't tell and it didn't taste like blackberry at-all. My friend told me that my sangria was downright flavorful compared to whatever water-down beverage they brought him.  Eating at a chain can be tricky. Despite featuring every type of dish under the sun, most of them aren't really palatable. You can usually count on the rubs being so salty they dry out the meat, the protein being inferior, minuscule and overcooked, and the glazes being candy-sweet. At least the menu listed dishes' calorie counts, so I could see how fattening that salad really is. I saw the $10 dishes, but I was afraid to try them because of the reasons listed above.  Finally, I just had to order something; I decided upon the hand-battered fish and chips. Most restaurants can usually provide a reliable deep-fried item. And I was right. The waitress forgot my tartar sauce, but the batter was flavorful enough that I didn't miss it. The fish seemed freshly battered, not something Gorton's Fisherman dragged out of the freezer. Still, I was shocked when the bill came back with a $17 price tag for it. I'm even more shocked that the price for this at the 42nd Street location is $20. For a few pieces of fried fish, french fries and a tablespoon of coleslaw? That's upscale dining prices. I didn't have to suck it up at an Applebees to pay that.  If distance wasn't a constraint I would have suggested we head over to Mighty Balls or Arepas for cheaper, tastier options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3?start=20,2.0,2.52,2.52,2.12,2.3120000000000003

We wanted to go to dinner somewhere close to the bowling alley we were planning to go to, so we picked Applebee's as a safe choice. We went in already knowing for 10 people it would be a bit of a wait. The hostess told us we would be waiting about 20 minutes and were okay with that. I'm not gonna lie, it got pretty packed quick. But we kept seeing people after us getting seated and I still didn't say anything. Twenty or so minutes passed and I asked the hostess if our table will be ready son . She assured me that they were just waiting to set up a table for all of us. I was like okay and she told us to wait. A group of six people, who arrived five minutes after I spoke with the hostess, ended up getting seated before us. I was a bit annoyed at this point, so I went up to her and asked her what was taking so long? She told me she was waiting on a table for ten people so she can seat is. I told her, ""then why sit six people who came AFTER us before us when you could've cleared an extra table to sit us right away?"" And she just said for us to wait. Mind you, we were there for almost an hour and at this point I was losing patience. The waitresses and the hostess looked like they were fresh out of higher school and this is their first job in handling a fast paced environment. The manager came to me to assure us that our table will be ready in five minutes. We didn't get seated till another 15 minutes. On top of that, our own waitress kept getting our orders wrong. And when it came to paying the bill I had to stand next to her to explain how we are splitting the bill. And she didn't give us the right bill when she added the birthday desert. How can you not see the dollar difference?! Anyways, I was so deeply disappointed in all this that we left a $10 tip on a $200 bill. They're even lucky to get any sort of tip to begin with.

Goes straight to other people asking them if they need anything and went off taking someone else order.. 10 mins later finally received our check paid for it.

My side had food pieces all over it that I ended up wiping down myself. So that was nasty. I know they are a busy place and it's like a revolving door with all the movie goer traffic, but atleast maintain cleanliness lol  The waitress recommended the berry sangria which was very good! I ended up splitting the appetizer combo with my fiancé and I guess it looked better than it tasted. Only thing about it I really enjoyed was the little chicken quesadillas on it. Otherwise I thought the boneless wings were very salty, mozzarella sticks flavorless, and the spinach dip not so good lol  But again- it's a chain restaraunt and I wasn't expecting to be blown away by flavor lol It's a good spot to hit up though if you are going to head to the movies nearby or perhaps a spot on Steinway for shopping or whatnot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3,2.04,2.37,2.37,2.668,2.2380000000000004

They have huge TV's wrapped around the bar, and if you want to hear the TV you're watching the bartender can provide you with little sound boxes to do so.  It's usually a calm environment during the week unless a big game is on then you'll need to get here a little early. The weekends are what you'd normally expect for a place like Applebees especially when you have the movie theatre right down the block. I should mention in this review you can come here for a meal and then ask for half priced movie tickets I think that's always been a good deal since it saves you money from buying expensive concession foods at the theatre.

My fav are the chicken wings and quesadillas , and u really can't go wrong with 10 oz $2 blue moons lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-astoria-3,3.0,2.51,2.51,,2.7060000000000004
