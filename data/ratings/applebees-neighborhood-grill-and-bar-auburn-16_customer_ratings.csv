18,Lesley E.,"Millersville, MD",1,66,,1.0,2012-08-20,"Ordered a southwest-style wrap. Had a funny taste to it...this sudsy taste reminded me of childhood, and timeouts. I had my bf check it out, and upon smelling it, he knew why it tasted off. Soap. That's right, I had detergent/soap in my wrap. I hadn't complained, been rude, been picky, or sent anything back. So I'm not sure why my wrap was targeted, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. Granted this was back in '11....but there are just certain things that make me bypass a joint permanently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
20,Susan S.,"Oakdale, PA",0,16,4.0,3.0,2013-02-24,"We went here late afternoon on 2/13/12.  Three stars for the food; ten stars for our waitress.  She was friendly, attentive, and in the top 1% of waitresses we have encountered.  She is an excellent representative for Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16?start=20,,,,,
10,Dr. Jenny D.,"Worcester, MA",202,7,,1.0,2013-05-10,"I consider myself to be a strong, independent woman. I am enjoying my thirties, and keeping busy with any number of normal adult activities. It's great, but sometimes it can be hard to find a balance between spooning my basset hound, not exercising, and staying up on Monday Night Raw storylines, so it's easy to lose touch with friends. Fortunately, my two best gal pals, Katy and Sarah, and I are big time foodies, and we reserve Friday lunches for some girl hangs and gourmet fair.  Our favorite spot is obviously the Olive Garden in Worcester, you cannot beat their authentic Italian menu, but this week we decided to check out Applebees. I had a fifty dollar gift card, and just thought, why not? I enjoy their television commercials, and it seemed like a good idea.  Do you know that scene at the beginning of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" when young Dwight Schrute is at the sketchball gas station with Chris Hardwick and their ladies and everyone has this uneasy feeling, like shit is about to get real but nobody wants to be a pussy and bail on the situation. That's pretty much what happened to me this afternoon. The ""Crapplebees"" joke I busted to Katy on the way to the restaurant felt somewhat ominous, but I shook it off, not realizing it was a prediction of what was to come. Everything started off just fine. The menu is like fifteen pages long, with all sorts of combo deals and specials, which was a little overwhelming, but the waitress answered our questions and we ordered our lunch. Sarah and I both decided on a salad and turkey bacon avocado sandwich combo, that seemed a smart choice. Katy opted for a chicken shrimp number from the ""healthy"" section of the menu.  It took about forty-five minutes for our lunch to come out, which seemed strange. I didn't go to culinary school, but turkey sandwiches typically take about five minutes tops to put together, and I'm pretty sure microwaving a slab of chicken and some vegetables doesn't take much longer than that. Our sandwiches looked like a Gulag lunch special. They didn't have avocado or bacon, and the ""turkey"" was a greyish white. The waitress dropped them off like a hot potato and immediately booked it, which makes me think she was aware of the fact that they were total shit.  After a ten minute hang sesh with her buds, the waitress returned, and Sarah asked what the good word was with these rat ball sandwiches. She apologized and told us they would make a new one. She goes into the kitchen for a few minutes, and returns to explain that the chef had an emergency and needed to leave, so he threw the sandwiches together, but she would bring a new one out on a plate for us to split. Katy was finished with her meal at this point, and ready to keel over and die, but we waited another twenty minutes to get an equally crappy sandwich. I'm pretty sure the avocado had been poisoned, and there is no way the tomato didn't come straight from soaking in a vat of paint thinner. Nothing tasted like real food. We had just finished eating when the waitress dropped the check off, she left all our dirty plates with contaminated lunches sitting in front of us. It was like, this ship wreck of gross food staring us down, making a mockery of the fact that we cheated on our beloved Olive Garden. A manager came by after we paid, and Sarah told him everything, including the waitress' excuse about the cook needing to leave. He was surprised, and told us that nobody in kitchen had any kind of emergency. Um. Ultimate plot twist. THE WAITRESS LIED. I don't care that she made up an excuse, it's the fact that she told us the stupidest lie in the history of lies that pisses me off. I mean, we didn't even question why the sandwiches were wrong in the first place.  Everything started unraveling at that point, Sarah and I had our lunches taken off the bill, which was nice, but the whole scene was a nightmare world. I fell into a massive panic attack while we spent ten more uncomfortable minutes at the table after the manager insisted we wait there for him to refund the gift card. He sends the waitress back with the adjusted bill, and she informs us that she paid for our sandwiches. The lies never end with this girl. She's like the waitress equivalent of that sketchy boyfriend everyone had in their twenties who was always lying to your face about seeing his ex girlfriend, but you kept dating him anyway because you thought it was true love, and by the end of the relationship you couldn't believe a single word that came out of his mouth.  My advice to you is to stay as far away from this Applebee's funhouse of terror as possible. It felt like we were all on a horrible mushroom trip, and there isn't enough Ativan in the world to handle that place. I still have like, thirty dollars left on my gift card, but I'll probably just hit up a different one after nine when it turns into a night club known as ""The Bees"". I'm sure it won't be strange and depressing at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
17,Erica S.,"Boston, MA",3,40,,1.0,2014-04-30,"I went to this Applebees about 6 months ago. I ordered a burger well done. When it came the burger was bleeding all over my plate, gross. Definetely not even close to well done. I called the waitress over and asked her why my burger was so uncooked, she apologized then took it back. I waited about a half hour for my new burger. At this time my best friend was already done eating. The new burger came out and when I bit into this one it was very pink inside. I sighed feeling like I just couldn't win in this situation. Also my best friend ordered a salad and noticed that the lettuce wasn't fresh and it had a stale, limp texture. She sent it back once to the kitchen to get an equally nad salad. Does this restaraunt not understand how to cook/make food? I honestly feel it would be very easy to catch food poisoning there. They don't seem careful about how their food is cooked. Ugh....skip this place. Go to TGIFs or Unos, much better choices than Crappybees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
11,Fir L.,"Southbridge, MA",0,2,1.0,4.0,2014-06-01,"Sturbridge applebee's is o.k. but this auburn applebee's is great. I never cared for applebee's but stopped in wen lookin to feed my mommy-to-be And quench my craving for a margarita. chicken quasidilla was phenomenal. usually I only like frozen margaritas. I got a liquid on ice without realizing it. many liquor and flavor options. I got the kiwi ""perfect"" margarita and it was damn near perfect. especially since it was a non-frozen margarita.  awesome food, drinks, and service. I recommend giving it a try",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
13,D D.,"Shelton, CT",0,19,,1.0,2015-04-14,"Found a riblet bone in my burger. They tried to claim it came from the fryer??!!  Burgers don't go in the fryer and there was no meat on it. I shudder to think that perhaps it came from someone's plate!  They had a video game interactive screen on the table. The server didn't indicate there was a charge, nor did the game display it. We got billed .99 and then the manager made us feel cheap for asking for a refund. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
15,Niki G.,"West Simsbury, CT",0,7,10.0,4.0,2015-05-06,The computers were down and the bartender was working her butt off. Sad to see the manager and the rest of the staff sitting around talking and eating without helping her out. But otherwise the food and the bartender service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
9,Erika K.,"Quincy, MA",41,18,,1.0,2015-05-09,Disgusting. Yes I know it's a typical chain restaurant but everything tasted salty. Had 2 apps and an entree and every bite was like eating a spoon of salt. Now I remember why I haven't been here in years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
1,Dedania M.,"Boston, MA",265,94,88.0,2.0,2015-06-20,"Trying not to be bias since most simple chain restaurants aren't my favorite; Ordered:  Tomato soup- Was light and a little watered down with a couple of croutons Pork dumplings- The worst thing I could have ever ordered. They were nothing like the usual gyoza/dumplings I get at most places. The filling meat was gross, they were really tiny, and the dipping sauce that came with it was not appetizing. I end up just eating the corners of the dumpling and not with the filling or sauce. :( Service:  Our waitress was friendly with no problems. My friend ordered some dish with potatoes and there was a root in his dish. I think the waitress overhead it or he told her, but he got free dessert on the house for it. I don't think my friend minded the issue but it was a nice gesture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
14,Christie T.,"Montgomery, PA",3,27,5.0,4.0,2015-08-13,"After many hours in the car, this particular Applebee's felt like an oasis of genuinely friendly people and kind service. I just wanted to hug our waitress, Melissa. She was great. We staggered in with two yelling and babbling young kids and a mother in law. I ordered a beer from Melissa for my husband (who had been the driver all day) before we even sat down. She nodded and got it quickly, then when he finished that, she offered jokingly to let him behind the bar to drink from the tap if he needed it. She got extra crayons for our daughter. She pulled out extra straws for baby. The food was decent, reliable. Most servers were pregnant. On the one hand, that makes them all the more understanding of exasperated parents and energetic kids. On the other hand, don't drink the local water. Unless you want to be in the family way like eighty percent of the women here. Overall this ordinary chain provided us with a wonderful respite in the evening of a very long day. We thank you, Melissa and the rest of the staff of Applebee's Auburn!! You do a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
0,Ricardo H.,"Worcester, MA",153,9,,5.0,2015-10-11,"I've gone to this Applebee's and they have always been very nice, accommodating, and the food is great. I once mentioned that the chips were a bit salty last time I went, and they made a fresh batch of chips and tasted perfect.  Friends of mine have said they don't go to Applebee's anymore because of previous service experience, but I haven't had any bad experience in around 6 visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
8,Dominique D.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",3,25,5.0,3.0,2015-11-21,"We always like Applebee's, when we come to the States.  This one is as expected, but the service is a bit slow...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
6,Mary M.,"Southbridge, MA",26,39,5.0,3.0,2016-04-12,"This is the better Applebee's out of all the ones in our area. We have been here quite a few times for dinner and compared to the other Applebee's they are pretty decent. Every time we have gone we have had great service, and food was prepared as ordered in a timely fashion. There is plenty of parking and they also offer a to go option if they are too packed for your liking or you want to eat at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
5,Allecia D.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",113,11,3.0,5.0,2016-08-23,"Michael, the guy who took our order over the phone was ""the bomb"", they may or may not be his words but he definitely made the night SO MUCH BETTER. We spent a very long day after driving 14 hours, unpacking my best friends new dorm room for almost eight hours, had barely water to drink and had failed to find a good place open on our way back home. After two failed attempts to get food, We pulled up to this Applebee's and didn't even have the desire to walk in and sit down, since were so tired, but as soon as Michael got on the phone he livened up the mood and was very upbeat, personable, and hilarious. Your very lucky to have such a great, fun person working for you, I hope he gets some recognition for how amazing he is. That kind of relaxed, natural, fun personality is hard to find. Thanks for making me laugh and being more than just a voice on the line to place an order. Seriously that makes all the difference in customer service. Kudos, Michael! Thanks for making me laugh and helping me enjoy the rest of the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
4,Randy J.,"Troy, NY",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-18,Worst service I have experienced. I was seated and waited 15 minutes for a waiter and not one stoped. I would have given this restaurant 0 stars if it was possible. I won't be back ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
7,Robert W.,"Framingham, MA",0,10,,1.0,2017-02-22,"This place doesn't deserve a star, not even one.  I stopped in this location last night against my better judgment and before I walked in actually described the exact scenario that happened to me to my friend on the phone.  I sat at the bar planned on order some food.  Bartender continued to talk to two customers that were together never looked up had a waitress join her while they proceeded to have a conversation. Approx 10 minutes went by and she decided to take my drink order, gave me a menu.  While I was reviewing the menu she washed glasses in front of me, I closed the menu before she finished washing the glasses, she never looked up dried her hands went to the other end of the bar and used her cell phone.  She returned to the register in front of me at least 4 more times and never asked if I would like to place an order.  I have been to this location before and its always the same service.  This is a chain that should just close. I work on the same road so I have already shared my experience many times today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
3,D P.,"Oxford, MA",0,40,2.0,1.0,2017-04-02,"Hostess greeted us immediately and asked if we would like to sit at a high top. We did.  Then we sat there for a few minutes without any kind of acknowledgement while a waitress walked up and held a conversation with a couple next to our table. When they finished their private conversation, she came to our table. That made me mad. This after I had been avoiding the place for months because of rude bartenders. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
2,Greg H.,"Fabius, NY",0,22,23.0,4.0,2017-05-07,The service was excellent - the food was very good and came out quickly. My waitress Maria recommended the wonton chicken tacos as an appetizer and they were outstanding. I had the salmon with a shrimp skewer and it was very good. I would definitely eat there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-16,,,,,
