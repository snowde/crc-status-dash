8,Brittany M.,"Grass Valley, CA",2,67,,4.0,2012-02-14,"I've eaten at this Applebee's multiple times with my husband and I have to say it really isn't all that bad - at least when we've been there. The service is always consistently decent, the food is consistently what you'd expect from an average Applebee's - not overly greasy, but nothing life changing or amazing - pretty standard, average American cuisine. It's always a bit pricey, but we get the 2 for $20 deal. The appetizers are always very good. We've always left here feeling like we had a decent meal for the price. I will say their alcoholic drinks taste like there's hardly any alcohol at all... but oh well. Overall, it's a good place to go if you don't feel like cooking every now and then. It's always pretty packed and loud, but that's the standard for anywhere you go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17?start=40,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998

28,Jacob B.,"Auburn, CA",9,13,7.0,2.0,2012-06-14,"I have eaten lunch / dinner here at least 5 times.  I'm giving 2 stars because I am not impressed with the food at all.  I know I should have pretty low expectations since it is just Applebee's, but I end up leaving disappointed after every meal there. My wife had the ribs one time, at least we think they were ribs.  She called them ""fibs""...... fake ribs.  They didn't look like real ribs at all, sort of on the level of what I would expect out of a McRib. I have no complaints about the staff or the service level, as it has been descent each visit.  Although one time was a little odd when my wife and I were seated at a table next to some dude who was dining with his Persian cat along side him.  I am a total animal person, especially cats, but it was just a strange experience to be eating in a restaurant while kitty is getting fed dinner bits a few feet away.  I was surprised they allowed that, since a lot of people are allergic to cats.  I was wondering how they might react if I brought in my 110 pound German Shepherd to dine along side me.  ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004
31,Karole M.,"Grass Valley, CA",37,51,4.0,3.0,2012-06-15,"Ok, let me first wrap my head around the fact that I'm actually giving a review of Applebees.  Now I need to remember that this is a chain and not the wonderful Mom and Pop type places I typically frequent. Last, I should focus on the fact that the menu item photos will never look like what you actually get on a plate. So now that I've taken into consideration all of the above, I have to say that the last two times I've visited Applebees have both been at this Applebees in Auburn.  Both times, we were seated quickly by a friendly host/hostess.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and our drinks were brought to us quickly (even though my drink the first time wasn't made correctly). The food was really very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were sauteed the way I like.  However, there were way too many greasy onions and my garlic potatoes didn't have any garlic in them.   Honestly, I think the prices for what you get are ridiculously overdone.  An $80 bill for four dinners?... wait... An $80 bill for four Applebees dinners? Not worth it. $40... yes.  Absolutely.  Our server was sweet and attentive so we gave her a 20% tip but I did argue with myself beforehand considering I didn't feel our meals were worth the bill amount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17?start=20,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

37,david y.,"Rocklin, CA",0,15,,2.0,2013-06-25,"Went for lunch today, disappointing. I have to admit there wasn't anything wrong with the restaurant or our food, it's just that our expectations of the food were evidently too high. My friend ordered the American BLT (regular sandwich) and it was ok for $7. On the other hand, I tried a Lunch Combo. It's supposed to be a half sandwich and small bowl of soup ($8). The chicken tortilla soup was fine. The half sandwich though... that was a total joke. The 'new' Turkey Breast sandwich on my plate was about the width of half my pinky finger (maybe 1.5 inches) and about 5 inches long. It was literally 3 bites (not big ones) and was a total joke.

Sadly the food did not compare to the service. Well, two out of the four entrees we ordered were burnt. One of the entrees was a chicken dish and the whole bottom of the chicken breast was burnt a similar problem occurred with one of the other entrees sadly the second entree was completely overlooked and somewhat burnt.

27,Jennai P.,"Grass Valley, CA",68,25,2.0,1.0,2014-04-05,"We just returned from a terrible dining experience. My husband and I decided to go to Applebees for dinner. We were seated quickly as it wasn't particularly busy. We got out drinks in a timely manner, but it took the waitress about 15-20 minutes to come take our order. We ordered a bacon burger with fries, the chicken penne sun dried tomato pasta and for an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip. It took about 15 minutes for the spinach dip to arrive. When we got it, it was warm, and the chips were stale. We didn't bother complaining as we were very hungry so we just dealt with it. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the same with out dinner. My chicken penne pasta arrived cold, with cold diced tomatoes on it (no sun dried tomatoes to be seen) and the pasta was so overdone it was like paste. The burger was ok, but the fries looked like they had been reheated already.  I'm not generally a ""send it back"" kind of person, but this was not edible food. Bu the time I finally got the waitress' attention, my husband was nearly finished with his burger. I gave the waitress the food and opted not to order anything else as I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes, nor did I want to sit and eat by myself. The waitress acted like she was doing us a huge favor by taking my meal off of the bill. Mind you, I took 2 bites and gave my husband a bite to make sure it wasn't just me being picky. The table next to us had ordered the same drink, and I am not exaggerating, SIX times and had never received a single one. The place was only half full, and there was only one person sitting at the bar. There is no excuse for this poor of service. They were not short staffed as servers were tripping over each other there were so many. I feel like Applebees should have at least comped us our appetizer as the chips were stale, and I left without dinner.

While she was pleasant, she was so annoying which is why I won't state her name. Overly salesy, overly rehearsed words, asked my boyfriend if he wants a refill while taking care the table next to us which I thought was unprofessional. I don't want to be included with another parties dining experience. We are all seperate. I'll be back for the food and drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

One night after a long day from we me and my husband decide to go have dinner there everyone was super nice we ordered and everything, I got my food wonton tacos I was enjoying them as I'm half way through my taco and I start pulling it out of my mouth, I told my husband my hair doesn't easily fall off and you know that. He got one waitress to help me out who sent another waitress who took my food and apologized. She came back with a new plate of tacos and she said "" sometimes it helps to know but it was your hair you may feel less grossed about the situation me and the supervisor took a look at it and it looks like your hair.""  Still bringing me the hair that I put in the plate ,First of all how could you make an accusation against your customer couldn't we be more professional and just take care of the problem period and not make accusations and make your customer uncomfortable.

44,Joanna L.,"Newcastle, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-24,"We got here around 8pm.  We were served quickly and the food was average, which is par for Applebee's.  There is a little device on the table that let's you order/pay/call for the server.  We used it to pay, but I wanted to take my food home so I selected the button to call for the server.  I guess they figured that because we had paid that they didn't need to help us  we sat at the table for 15 minutes with the red light flashing calling for service and we're ignored by our server who served the people beside us then left.  Not only that but we were ignored by the other servers, too.  I won't be coming back.

Wife and I just ordered two burgers and when I picked mine up grease just dropped and dropped out of it and left a puddle about 6"" around on my plate. My wife took a bite of hers and all she could taste was the grease on a BBQ burbon burger. We won't be going back. The manager came out and did t charge us for the meal or the meal my daughter had and even though you could tell she felt bad and gave us a free mazzarello stick plate next time we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
45,Rana S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,41,2.0,5.0,2017-05-15,"I came here with my mom and brother because we wanted to try their 2 for $20 promotion. The restaurant is clean and well attended - we were were seated right away because it wasn't too busy. We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer (which was quite good), I got the Three Cheese Cavatappi, my brother got the Spinach and artichoke Cavatappi and my mom got the half rack and chicken breast grill combo. Mom and brother were happy with their meals but I would say for mine it wasn't very saucy (it was like eating just macaroni), I couldn't tell there were three cheeses and it lacked flavor so I added some black pepper and that made it a bit better. I like spicy foods though and would have loved some hot red pepper (or something!) to give it a zing of flavor. Next time I'll try the ribs....mom's was good! But the food is fine and as expected for a chain like this...our server Jason B really made the night great by being so attentive and taking care of us so well. I would come back to this location for him next time we drive through Auburn, he was so nice! Although come to think of it, all of the servers seemed to be professional and attentive to their customers so maybe they're all worth coming back for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
39,Eric H.,"Applegate, CA",20,33,6.0,2.0,2017-10-06,"Applebee's has been in this location in Auburn for many years.  I have lived near Auburn for even longer.  Sometimes you drive by a place day after day and don't even give it a second thought.  As time passes your forget the reasons that you don't go there.  My wife wanted to pick up dinner on her way home from Grass Valley and we decided to give it another try, it had been at least two years since our last visit. This time I would call in an order and she would pick it up as it was late in the evening, about 8:40.  She told me what she wanted on the phone and I went to my computer to look at the menu.  The web site told me that I could order on-line and get $5.00 off my first on-line order using a code that they provided.  I proceeded to the menu ordering system and placed an order for fish & chips, a burger with a baked potato and an order of nachos. At the end of the ""fill your cart"" portion I entered all of the pertinent personal information, email address, name, etc.  There was a field for the coupon code.  It wouldn't take the code that was advertised on the previous page.  I tried it twice, I decided to complete my order anyway.  I entered all of my credit card information and completed the order.   I included a $5.00 tip as I figured some server was going to have to assemble the order with utensils etc.  It was about 8:45 PM.  The site told me that our order would be ready at 8:58 PM.    My wife arrived there at 9:00 and they told her that it wasn't ready yet.  She waited and waited, she texted me and waited some more.  At about 20 minutes after they finally brought her the food.  They told her that they did not have any potatoes to make baked potatoes, they substituted mashed and gravy instead.  She was already aggravated at this point as she had waited too long.   The gravy was already coating the inside of the bag so they had to re-bag the food and place the gravy container inside another container to prevent spillage. 8 minutes later, she is home with the food.  I was not happy with mashed potatoes.  How does a restaurant run out of potatoes to bake?  Maybe poor management of the ordering process.  It's not like they are items that spoil in a day or two.  The burger was very good, the nachos were so-so. My wife started on her Fish & Chips and they were not even warm.  We surmised that they probably were prepared first and sat while the rest of the order was cooked.  She was extremely disappointed and had to microwave the fish to warm it up. Now it all comes back to me why we drive past that Applebee's as if it doesn't exist!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
38,Teresa L.,"Nevada City, CA",0,15,,5.0,2017-12-10,"Most of the time when thou go to a chain restaurant you think of it as just that. I have to say the Auburn location seems a step above and the service is exceptional. I try to never be demanding at a restaurant but I have to admit that yesterday we were a bit needy.  Changed our mind on drink order after already placed,  then server actually came back and suggested something different as similar drink was on special.  Also changed our mind and decided to order dessert, last minute.  They were very busy but still very attentive,  even with our neediness.  Kelsey,  our server was amazing and very pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
