8,Rick W.,"Avon, OH",30,260,9.0,4.0,2015-01-10,We have had great service here every time we visit this place. The trio of apps are good and we always get the fiesta salad. YUM!  No complaints here and yes we will go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
7,Matt B.,"North Ridgeville, OH",6,21,,2.0,2015-04-30,If it was up to me I would keep my eating out away from chains. But with the fam and they picked this place the other day. Service was bad. Real bad. They have these new computers that you order apps and drinks and play games on. The whole process was more of a pain than anything and somehow my son charged our table $2 for some game. Then It took 15 minutes to confirm I paid for our bill on the thing. I didn't even bother disputing the $2 game charge. Avoid chains!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
5,Tammy C.,"Roswell, GA",137,4,,1.0,2016-04-16,"Terrible To-Go service! I called twice, no answer so I assumed they were busy, I then decided to order at the restaurant. I waited well over 15 mins for the lady to take my order!  Several ladies asked if I've been helped, and I said ""no""... Finally someone took my order. After all the wait time, I get home with my order and it's wrong!! I would advise you to check every single item before leaving!  Furious that my request was not followed!! Unacceptable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
6,Lorin R.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",1,1,,1.0,2016-05-04,"Terrible to go service... Placed the order, told it would be ready in 15 minutes only to arrive at the given time and find out that it was never entered in their system... I'm still waiting for my food 30 minutes later. Don't waste your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
3,Martha C.,"Avon, OH",90,36,13.0,5.0,2016-06-23,"Great service for lunch time! Our server/ bartender Lauren was amazing! Drinks were refilled and we didn't have to wait for anything! Upside to the drinks, they switched to glasses! I'm not a plastic lover, and I know that's petty. But it's something I think is great. We had the wonton tacos and Spinach dip app. Both were delicious, but I recommend the wonton tacos. I tried the new crispy chicken cornbread salad, it has a light dressing drizzle and was DELICIOUS! Not swimming in dressing, everything was portioned properly, and the salad was very filling! I'm definitely coming up more often and trying this summer menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
2,Megan R.,"Wadsworth, OH",22,44,125.0,1.0,2016-12-20,"Service was horrible. Took 5 mins to before a server showed up. Didn't suggest drinks-apps-food as should have. No specials discussed until after I asked.  Ordered two orders of pretzel app, two orders of wings, nachos and a wrap. Brought one order of pretzels out. She forgot the mustard and gave us blue cheese instead, what? Rest of food came out 5 mins after. Had to ask for silverware and plates for all apps.  Food is so-so at best. Typical chain food, not horrible but nothing to write home about. Side note- I worked at An Applebee's as one of my first jobs (over 20yr-yes I am old lol). I can't imagine that the training and expectations have changed how to take care of a customer. Clearly this location thinks it is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
4,Jeff B.,"Sheffield Lake, OH",0,10,,2.0,2017-02-19,Went here for dinner last night.  The steak used to be better before they changed to the Wood Fire Grill. Never used to have to trim fat or grissel. 6 of used to be 2 for $20 and 8 is was 2 for $25. Now you get a 6oz for $25?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
1,Tiffany S.,"Avon, OH",96,199,152.0,5.0,2017-06-02,"The Avon Applebee's team is awesome! They went out of their way to donate a fabulous meal to our lacrosse team for our season ending banquet this week. The food was so great! Scott, the manager, was so kind and helpful to work with, and Ally took time to carefully prepare everything. It was perfect!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-avon-5,,,,,
