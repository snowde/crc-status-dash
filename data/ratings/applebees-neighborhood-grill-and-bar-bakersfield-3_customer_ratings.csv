I went with my family with the intent of ordering a salad, but at 10 bucks for a salad served with their preservative laden dressings, no thanks. So I decided not to order anything. My mom ordered a steak that came with a side of vegetables and potatoes, so she gave me her sides. Let me tell you, these were the most overcooked vegetables ever! The vegetables were so overcooked that they didn't even hold their shape. It was like eating baby food. The potatoes tasted like chlorine. I tried some of their fries, which were good. No one at my table was really pleased with their food. I mean, it's edible, but it's just not good. I'm highly suspicious that this place just pops all their food in the microwave. The building and location are nice. The service is average. The clientele are mostly overweight. Do yourself a favor and cook at home, or support a local restaurant.

The cherry on top of it all was that we were seated next to a pair of parents who obviously had to sense of parenting when their child enjoyed playing with a knife and fork, throwing things over to our booth, and screaming at the top of his lungs. Nope, no effort by the parents or management to control the situation. Even after I brought it to the managers attention, he told me there was nothing he could do. He didn't even acknowledge our request to move and stated we would have to wait back in line like everyone else. And there go the stars.

Hubby had a lunch combo of Thai Shrimp Salad and a Wrap. I had french onoin soup and honey chicken. It came with fries too. I was very pleased with the soup. Good flavorful broth, plenty of onions and a bunch of cheese and bread on top. The chicken was delicious and moist and the fries were piping hot.  Minus one star for the overly air conditioned place. I know Bakersfield gets super hot, but I had to ask to be moved because of the arctic wind chill that was blowing on me. The server said it's automatic and she can't adjust it.

I got the Wonton tacos with extra slaw, the nachos , sweet potato fries. I really enjoyed the look on my waitresses face when I ordered all this without the meat!! Seems like that must never happen. Anyways so back to the food - tacos good , nachos were blah not special quiet the opposite I would say so the chips must have been from the bottom of the bag they were small and stale the microwaved cheese on top I mean come on seriously!!!! Sweet potato fries were pretty good but it doesn't require much skill to deep fry.   The mac was good, although the first came out with bacon and I had to send that back and that was for the kids so while we were waiting for the mistake to be fixed all the food was getting colder and soggy.

79,H F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,225,64.0,2.0,2017-02-22,I wish I could say that only the food was bad in taste but more than that both the hubby and myself had an upset stomach. Spinach dip and chips was way too salty. I looked up the nutritional facts later and it had 3980 milligrams of sodium. The beer cheese and pretzels was still a little salty at 1700 milligrams but edible. Unfortunately both of these items are pre-made from corporate and come to them this way. Corporate needs to fix this problem.  The four cheese mac and cheese is made with bacon but unfortunately it doesn't state it on the menu. The house salad comes with bacon but it doesn't state it on the menu. This is not good for vegetarians.  The fries were excellent and came out hot. The salmon on cedar plank was very good also. All the food that came out of the kitchen was hot and there's a lot to be said for that.  Not sure what upset our stomachs but if the food had not given us an upset stomach I would have given them a review of 3 stars instead of 2.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bakersfield-3?start=40,2.48,2.34,2.34,2.216,2.396

78,Bob W.,"Bakersfield, CA",92,12,35.0,5.0,2017-03-26,"Wow! What a treat tonight was bringing the wife and kids to Applebee's during Happy Hour! Our kids, 9 and 13  had been craving hot wings for a few days which is a monthly norm for them.  Dena and I like em' too and since we were out and about decided tonight would be the night. We have another favorite spot in town for hot wings, but tonight Applebee's got the call and off we went. When we got there the hostess greeted us by kindly opening the door for us and with a smile asked if we wanted a table in the loft area or would we like the Happy Hour floor/bar area. Of course in my mind the words Happy hour meant ice cold beer so my response was quick and off to the floor we went. We were greeted promptly by our server Amanda, who was very sweet and attentive.When we asked about the happy hour menu she explained that the HH menu did have hot wings but they were of the boneless type. We all agreed we wanted the bone-in wings and a helping of the spinach-artichoke dip. In quick time Amanda brought our drinks and made certain we were good to go. In no time our food appeared from the kitchen, all brought out at once by kitchen staff. Nice touch. Amanda followed up immediately and made certain we were covered with all necessities. The aurtichoke dip was maybe a little on the soupy side, but it tasted amazing. The chips are very light and tend to fall apart easily in the cheesy dish. Overall I'd rate them a strong 8/10 because of flavor and presentation. Now the good part. Last time we came to AB's we requested the kitchen to make our wings a tad hotter if they were able. We all like them with a good kick. What we were served honestly, they were just okay. They weren't nearly as spiced as the other place we like to go, but they were okay. Tonight though... omg! The flavor was amazing! The wings were very tender and spiced perfectly! Just enough to clear your sinus' but not so much that your taste buds were overwhelmed with heat. We ate through half of two 9-piece dishes when we realized that a couple of the drumsticks were just a tad undercooked. Really, not very much at all but just enough to make a person not want the next bite. The manager Dillon, noticed me looking at the chicken closely and scooted right over to the table to see what might be amiss. When I explained that there were a couple of wings out of the 10 we ate that seemed a little underdone, he quickly ordered us two additional plates to be cooked a little longer and paid for them himself!  He insisted! He explained that the wings were now bigger, which they were, and that the fryers cook at a certain time/temp, that suited the older style.  Great job Applebee's for stepping up to the plate in customer service. Made our night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bakersfield-3?start=40,2.68,2.43,2.43,2.452,2.5300000000000002

I can only imagine why you don't take reservations. Not the best service in the neighborhood!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bakersfield-3,2.56,2.55,2.55,,2.5540000000000003
0,Paul H.,"Clarendon, Australia",1,106,17.0,5.0,2018-01-03,Outstanding.  $12.99 unlimited ribs or chicken tenders.  The ribs are tender and tasty.  Took 25 minutes to get a seat but after that the service was excellent.  Desserts under $3 were a hit as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bakersfield-3,2.72,2.59,2.59,,2.6420000000000003

3,Alexis P.,"Bakersfield, CA",50,1,,2.0,2018-01-12,"This is the place to go for your average baller on a budget, starting from your 2 for 20 dinner date to your 12.99 all you can eat ribs or tenders for a limited time only OR SO I THOUGHT UNTIL I MET THERE MANAGER TONY a tall bald headed Caucasian. Apparently, we were not able to share the all you can eat dish even though we were clearly purchasing other items like 5 beers, 3 drinks, artichoke dip and wings! This was ridiculous so when I spoke with Tony and told a similar deal was at Olive Garden with there bottomless pasta and we were able to share his response was, ""Well we aren't Olive Garden unlike them we have to watch are food cost!"" He just had the worst attitude and clearly did not want to hear what we had to say! Honestly, I have had better experiences with Damiem there other manager he's such a great guy! WILL NOT BE COMING AROUND WHEN TONY IS WORKING ANYMORE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bakersfield-3,2.8,2.58,2.58,,2.668
