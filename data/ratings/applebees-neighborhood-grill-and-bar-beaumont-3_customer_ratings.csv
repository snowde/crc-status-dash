103,Mike F.,"Beaumont, CA",0,144,7.0,1.0,2012-08-16,Horrible Applebee's. We go there every 6 months to see if anything has changed. It never has. Horrible service. It takes forever to get your food. The food is always cold.  Not sure why they can't get it together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
55,Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8.0,4.0,2012-09-04,"Here is my new discovery to late night dining...  Although there aren't any Applebee's near me, but if I'm in a neighborhood with one, I'd be very happy to be a frequent patron there!  Don't ask me why I'm all the way out in Beaumont, but hopefully all the other Applebee's can model after this one... Applebee's is a Denny's-like diner except with much better food in my opinion... They have their famous special of either 2 for $20 or 2 for $24 with  an addition of a free full size appetizer included!  (Always pick the chicken wings for the best value!) but what I truly love is their 50% appetizers during happy hour! So what makes this Beaumont location different?  They allow all appetizers to be priced at 50% during happy hours!  YES!  ALL OF THEM!!!  Also, happy hour is anywhere in the restaurant not pertained to only the bar area... (Be sure to check with each of the Applebee's location about what exactly they are offering during happy hour!) What are my favorites? **Boneless chicken wings... (Beaumont location allows to be either bone in or boneless to be included in the happy hour special) **Cheeseburger sliders **Wonton Tacos **Onion rings Imagine... all these large portioned appetizers priced from $6.49 up to $9.99, but during happy hours, the prices ranges from $3.25 to about $5 bucks!  The portion stays the same too!!! One tip!  Should you be shopping at the Desert Hill Premium Outlets, this would be great place to have a late dinner after a long day of shopping!  It's probably only 7 minutes or so going 10 Westbound! Also, service here is great (Served by Kathleen)!  But the parking is tricky so be sure to pay attention when trying to get into this place.... not sure why they would setup their parking lot entrance like this.... Next time you are out late and there is an Applebee's nearby, be sure to check out their happy hour special!  Remember, HH happens between 3-6pm and 9p-close!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=60,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

The employees were quite nice even though they mentioned they were short staffed that day and we had to wait an extra 20 minutes. The diarrhea inducing food on the other hand is worth negative stars. My food actually tasted great even if it looked like someone scooped it out of the trash and put it on the plate. My wife hated her food and said it was the most bland crap that she's ever had. After lunch we both became violently ill and we attest it to the shrimp and undercooked chicken that were on both of our plates.  Oh, and the price of 2 days of diarrhea? $81 for four people. The food is way overpriced for what you get. I guess if you want to lose weight quickly and have tape worms eat away at your body it's the best place to go in the city other than eating a pile of garbage under the bridge. My wife had to miss work the next day. They also have these tablets on the table where you can play games against other people which would be nice but they actually add a charge to your bill if you play them. Again, service was good. They looked stressed out which is probably why we got food poisoning. Our family has vowed never to go back.

The host was difficult to understand. He kept mumbling and we had to keep asking him to repeat himself, which became very irritating the third time around. We waited about 10 minutes for a server to even greet us. We had already decided what we wanted to eat and drink by the time she got to us. She said she ""forgot"" that our table was in her section. Pretty embarrassing to admit, I think. When it came to ordering, I asked if I could substitute fruit for fries; I'm pregnant and I REALLY wanted fruit. The server said they didn't have fruit. Well, I looked at my daughter's kid's menu and they at least had apple dippers. Hello, the place IS called Applebees for Pete's sake. She could have offered me those considering that IS fruit, but no! The server showed me other sides I could choose from that wouldn't cost me extra, so I chose the grains and rice side. A few minutes later she came back and said, ""I'm sorry, I just found out I will have to charge you for the rice side. Is that ok?"". Of course it was NOT ok, and by then I was so irritated I just let my husband choose a side that sounded good to him that he could have. For her mistake, they should have given me the original side I wanted without the extra charge. The food was nothing special, and it was served to us on a table that was haphazardly wiped down, smelled like an old rag and felt sticky. Oh, and my daughter's highchair was delivered to us dripping wet in the middle by the mumbling host and was also sticky. I wiped it down myself. Just an overall unpleasant experience and a complete waste of $30, which included a very generous tip of $3.

First, the waitress was sarcastic, rude, snotty, refused to bring us ice water and refused to let me substitute anything for the coleslaw. I have a stomach issue that will not allow me to eat raw cabbage. She just told me, ""Too bad"" and then refused to take my order. My sister and I got up, left and had a wonderful, cheaper dinner at Denny's.

28,Steve G.,"Banning, CA",13,29,,2.0,2017-07-05,"We have been going to this location (and others) for a long time and normally have no problem. Most recently we visited on a holiday (July 4th), well after lunch hour. The restaurant was not busy at all, however service was very slow. Our Server was pretty much invisible the entire time and never checked back once our meals were served. I think she had two tables. As a hospitality professional, I understand that sometimes a Server is having a bad day and is not on their best game, so I always tip, regardless of service quality. However, the better you serve me, the better your gratuity. ALWAYS check with your guests within a few minutes of serving the entree', and as often as possible thereafter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

60,Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,4.0,2017-10-05,"Excellent craft burger, Caesar Salad, French Onion Soup and mashed potatoes.  Speedy service while in the bar area. NOTE:  all during the month of October, you can get a margarita in the bar or dining area for the amazing low price of only $1......What a GREAT PROMO....Spread the word...... The only drawback to this visit was the same nasty habit I now see spreading from server to server in the restaurant world:  They do not give you your change back with the bills, with the assumption that the change will be part of the tip.   Well, that is great for the server, but if you do the math and you were going to leave $3 tip, the extra 60 cents missing now bumps up the server's tip by another 20% from $3 to $3.60......Time for the manager here to step in and remind all servers and bar tenders to ALWAYS give the customer back his coins and then if he wants to leave them as part of the tip, it is at the customer's discretion.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3,3.6,2.98,2.98,,3.228

64,Kevin R.,"Beaumont, CA",0,13,,1.0,2017-12-28,"I was unfortunate to receive an Applebee's gift card as a Christmas gift. I considered throwing it out, but since it's been at least five years since I ate at an Applebee's, I decided to give it another shot. I ordered a bacon cheddar grilled chicken sandwich, and triple chocolate meltdown dessert. The latter was fine, but then again, it's difficult to screw up a brownie and vanilla ice cream. The fries had enough salt on them that I couldn't eat them. The sandwich was terrible - a thick slab of rubbery, reheated chicken that barely exceeded the quality of a bagged, microwaveable sandwich from a grocery store. Even having not spent a dime of my own money on the food, I still felt like I'd been ripped off, given that they had the audacity to charge $25 for a meal that, absent the brownie, was equivalent to food I would expect to find in a school cafeteria, or maybe a prison. If you're looking for a bland, rubbery, luke-warm beige lump of vaguely digestible protein, look no further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3,3.24,3.02,3.02,,3.1080000000000005
