I ordered a very basic snack, a quesadilla, a salad and a diet pop. The person taking my order was not friendly.  This was at 4:59 We pulled in and was totally ignored, even though we were the only car.  Usually most Applebees bring out your drinks and total, so they can get your credit card and process it.  Finally about 5:19 the server brought out my food. My quesadilla was average, but my salad was bad because of soggy stale croutons. It totally wrecked the salad. Since she did not get it earlier the server had to take my credit card inside to process. It took her so long - I ate my food before she returned. Never once did she smile or apologize for the delays. The server took my credit card and finally brought out my receipt at 5:35. Basically took 36 minutes to get a bad salad and a quesadilla.  For $13, I expect a lot more service and quality.  I will go to Applebees but will not go to this location again. I also will tell all our friends, family and co-workers to avoid this location. You should avoid it too.

When you get seated every time it's at least ten minutes before a server comes to the table and another five or ten before drinks come.

The meal was a MW steak, a fajita  wrap, mac and cheese bacon pasta with chicken strip dish, and a kids meal cheese pizza with fries. The quality was not up to par, the mashed red skin potatoes microwaved and pasty. The spinach dip runny and had a hardened cheese floating on top. I did not try the wings my mom and son said they were fine. The wrap was decent I do like the pico de gallo. My mom said her pasta  was just okay a bit bland and chicken strips slightly overcooked. We also had a mishap with my son's  drink there was a melted crayon on the inside of glass...my son didn't  notice right away and to say the least..not pleasant.

13,Mike S.,"Belleville, MI",33,103,374.0,3.0,2016-01-27,"Applebee's?! More like Crapplebee's am I right? Seriously though - this place sucks. I honestly can't believe there are hundreds of these places still across America.  It's hard to give this place a legit review when everyone should already know coming here is probably the worst choice you can make during your day besides maybe punching a baby or pushing an old lady off her electric scooter and then hopping on it and backing over her. I will concede their new menu is better than their old menu but, everything here is still a half step above a Swanson's Hungry Man TV Dinner. Most of the meats are clearly frozen and a lot of the stuff you will order comes out way too hot - which is a tell tale sign of a microwave being employed. I can microwave shit at my house, why do I want to drive all the way here and pay these clowns to do it for me? I'm lazy but not that lazy. There are just soooo many better places to eat, why do you even want to bother? I will say though this location had a couple of things going for it if I still can't talk you out of coming down here. We came in about 8:30 and there were at least 3 people cleaning. My negative self automatically assumed there was some type of inspection tomorrow but nonetheless, I have been some places a dozen times and never saw a single person cleaning so, I am happy to give credit where it's due. Also, the service was very good. Attentive, competent, friendly - and not just our server but, the others around us were similarly solid to their customers. The trifecta of what you'd want/expect. Which begs the question why a good server would want to work at Applebee's. But I digress. If you must go here the sriracha shrimp and beer cheese pretzel apps are decent, the quesadilla burger and bourbon street steak are also decent but all of this stuff is loaded with either sodium or MSG or both so, make sure you pound some waters. In closing, other restaurants that I've given 1 or 2 stars to should take notice. If I despise Applebee's but I'm willing to give them 3 stars well -  you need to step your game up playa because you clearly aren't giving it your best effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

7,Christina W.,"Belleville, MI",1,69,,3.0,2017-03-02,"Whenever I go to this Applebee's location, it's because the group I'm with wants something more upscale than the coney island down the road. In this case, ""upscale"" refers to the pricing, not the quality of food. On the plus side, we always get seated quickly and it is decorated nicely with references to local sports and attractions. That's it for pluses. On the downside, once at a table, it always takes 4ever to get service. The wait staff is usually nice and they take down orders accurately. Getting those orders in a timely manner or getting their attention later on is a study in futility.  The food we can afford to order is generally good. The less you pay, the smaller the portions. Until I win the lottery, I will not order their $10+ burgers. Their menu seems to have improved over time, but it's still too expensive for a chain. If you're into people watching, you'll be in overdrive at this location. Always an interesting crowd. I do appreciate that they support local businesses and veterans though. On a final note, I intensely dislike their new ordering/payment system at the table. I'm quite computer-savvy, but don't trust my info is protected on these table-top devices.

You suck at being a waitress, and don't play with your phone in view of waiting customers. Hope you can afford to to for our meals and drinks. Patrons margaritas.

20,Steve C.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,14,11.0,1.0,2017-04-13,Might be the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. Food was meh. Drink was meh. Staff was worse. I ate at the bar and they seemed to struggle to keep up when they were only slightly busy. Maybe understaffed? I would skip it for literally anywhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
10,Katrina F.,"Honokaa, HI",2,35,,4.0,2017-04-23,"I am not a big fan of this chain, however, this one in Belleville is the exception to my no Applebee's rule.  During a recent visit with family we ate at this restaurant twice.  The menu was a nice mix of items, with items from salad to burgers to mac and cheese to steak and all very tasty.  Our server was amazing.  Next time I am in town I will return to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

9,Rígel J.,"Belleville, MI",35,38,10.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"Cold TV dinner style food with worse service than microwaving it yourself. Came here for a late night bite (not much else open), abysmal service even though they were not busy at all. Food came out lukewarm at best. About an hour later.. Projectile vomit.. That's all I have to say, that finally did it for me, not coming her ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

4,Jamie M.,"Southgate, MI",1,20,,1.0,2017-09-12,"(I wish zero stars was an option). Multiple times I've come here and the service was poor. Takes a long time to greet us, a long time for drinks, a long time to check on us, and forgetful. I know it's not fine dining, but some servers need a lesson there on how to talk to a table. Way too unprofessional. Went to Canton to try that location and it was WAY better. Will eat there from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

0,Amanda W.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,16,,3.0,2017-10-03,"This location of Applebee's is decent. The food was good. I think it was a kids eat free night so the place was a disaster, I felt bad for the staff that had to clean it all up. Again, I think this was also the reason that the service was slow and the food took a very long time to come out. But the waitstaff did the best they could, they appeared to be short staffed, however, all of he waitstaff were very kind and attentive..:just overworked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
3,Patrick C.,"Belleville, MI",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-22,They used to have great French onion soup. Nice portions. Its now in a 'boat' .. If you remove the cheese you get 4 oz of soup. It slops around in that stupid boat to make it look like you are getting more soup than you are actually getting.

1,Princess A.,"Belleville, MI",115,14,4.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"My original review is below. I reduced from 4 stars to 1. On yelp no customers have more check ins at this location than me however every time I come I feel like I'm hassling the staff or inconveniencing them in some way. The only persons who is friendly there is Kelly who is the host. Anytime I have an issues I'm met with excuses from the management or I just get ignored. After today, checking in 6 times I have decided to stop going to this location. I will gladly spend $50 per week elsewhere. My place to go when the game in on. I like this Applebees location. Most of the staff here is friendly and the bartenders will actually have a conversation with you, especially if you're visiting alone. They do have busy times but I'm my experiences they generally staff properly in advance to be sure they're prepared for rushes. Half off appetizers after 9pm great for weekends and long nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-belleville-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
