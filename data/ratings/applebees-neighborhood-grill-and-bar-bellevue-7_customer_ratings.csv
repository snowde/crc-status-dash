24,Kristen B.,"Redmond, WA",158,159,27.0,1.0,2012-03-01,"I really dislike giving bad reviews... but seriously. Applebees.... Some of the most unappetizing food I have ever eaten in my entire life. Although the staff was extremely friendly and promptly sat us at a booth, the food was just horrendous. My better half and I ordered a few appetizers and were not pleased. A friend told us that the steak was surprisingly good, so we ordered it... Unfortunately... The steak looked as though it was broiled in the oven, or microwave, with grill marks added on at the end with some sort of heated cooking utensil. One bite was all we could stomach. Fortunately, the dog was hungry enough to eat all the leftovers. We promised ourselves that we would never be back.

I've been to Applebees before but it was never as distracting as this one. The people near our seat talked so loud and were distruptive the whole time. Our waiter didn't come for a really long time and forgot to even set out water for us. We finally ordered our food and when I got my order it was wrong. After asking for the correct plate he quickly grabbed the manager who came to appologize and bring the right order. I would be really ticked off if the poor guy wasn't practically in high school and overwhelmed with all the other tables around us. At that point I chose to take pity on him and tip him well and thank him for the time. I will be back to applebees, but never to this one again.

The drinks were strong, the food was fine, and they have a lot of tasty, healthy options (including steaks) under 550 calories.  Good luck finding low calorie options that aren't vegetarian/vegan from local restaurants - chains tend to do well with that kind of thing.  My steak was far from the best I've ever had, but it was good enough for the price that I paid. Service was good too.  I'd definitely come back for a happy hour or lunch.  It isn't Daniels Broiler but at the same time it's definitely better than Denny's so I don't understand the flak they're getting in many of the reviews here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.9920000000000004,2.72
3,Maria Y.,"Seattle, WA",64,262,72.0,2.0,2012-06-24,"This place is just.... not good. I am not opposed to chain restaurants, because while they are usually not particularly inspiring, the food is generally consistent and there is enough variety in the menu that everyone in a group will have something they like. This review is overdue - it was actually over a year ago that I ate here - but I remember it quite well. I came with some friends for my birthday, not all 21, so we sat at a table in the general dining area and not the bar. (In general, I prefer to sit in the bar at chain restaurants, because there are no noisy kids and overall a more relaxed feel.) I had not been to an Applebee's before, that I could remember, but this place was centrally located for all my friends, some of whom are picky, so I thought it would be a good option. Well.. it really wasn't. The drink I had was weak and the food was just not good. I had a grilled shrimp entree with veggies and the veggies were completely overcooked, mushy, and pathetic. I couldn't even finish them. The appetizers were good though, so I'm not going to give this place only one star (I reserve those for the truly disgusting places where the food is literally inedible.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.7920000000000007,2.6

Usually I don't think of this place when I want to go out to eat but it was close to where we were heading and quick. Our server was really nice and made sure to take care of us when the person he was training became overwhelmed. Turns out the guy knew my husband from HS so that was cool to watch them catch up. He ordered the quesadilla burger and a cup of french onion and I enjoyed the chicken wonton taco appetizers and a side salad. Even though it was early morning, they were serving both breakfast & lunch so that was cool. We're rarely in the area but I would surely consider coming back.

20,Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"I went into Applebee's expecting it to be the worst thing ever. Honestly. I haven't been to an Applebee's in years. I used to go a lot in college because they had Happy Hour that started at 9, and that's when I got off work across the street. But the food was always so disgusting, I refused to go back.  When Allie S and I decided to get shitfaced on a Saturday night because we were bored, we decided on Applebee's. My plan was to be a complete asshole and get kicked out, but I ended up actually planning on going back.  Sure, the food is still crap, always has been and always will be. I will only order their 1/2 price appetizers during HH, and will never order an entree here. We had some nachos, potato skins, and chicken wings. Most of them were ok, the chicken wings were pretty gross, I ended up just using them as a way to shovel bleu cheese dressing into my mouth. BUT, the food is cheap. It was like $13 total for all that food. Plus, when you're drunk, it doesn't matter as much.  Drinking is the reason to come here, surprisingly, they don't mess up alcohol. I had 3 long island iced teas which are $4 during HH, and for an extra $1 I got top shelf booze and more of it. I also had some sort of huge 32 oz beer which I drank with a straw, gangsta' style(really, white girl college style). They have 2 HH 3-6 and 9-close, everyday.  The real reason to come back though is the service, our server Andrew was fantastic. Nice, great at is job, funny, and cute! He ordered and held more drinks for us before HH ended, he was very friendly and spent a lot of time joking around with us, and even started being inappropriate with us(which had nothing to do with alcohol).  If you have zero expectations coming in here, and just plan on boozing it up, this really isn't *that* horrible of a place. Apparently you can get 30 chicken wings for $11 during HH.... so we plan on having the boys have a chicken wing eating contest, while Allie and I drink a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8600000000000003,2.64

My boyfriend and I like Applebee's because they have decent wings for cheap (Happy hour) and I personally could eat the oriental chicken wrap everyday of my life. The food is solid here, and the staff are overly nice.  I think they are trying to step it up because they have added new menu items. We tried the pretzels with cheese dip- wow, really good and surprisingly fresh, warm pretzels! We also had to order the fried green beans, while they were good they were a little too stringy for fried beans (if you've had these at different places you'll know what I mean). We may order this again, but doubt it. Pretzels, we would totally order again! They have TVs in every corner so my Dad watched the game while I talked his ear off.

It is a chain and it's not a place I normally choose to eat, but... it's fine sometimes. In this case, it was a pretty good experience. I got some standard small steak with veggies on the side and my friends were on some special diet, so they had some very specific requests for their salads. The waitress and kitchen did a great job listening to those requests and serving only what my friends wanted. The one funny but sad thing is that after my friends told her they were on a special diet and requested very minimal/specific salads, she still offered us brownie bites. I'm guessing she had to offer those things because... well, they just didn't fit with anything we ordered that day. Was this a fabulous gourmet experience?

We also tried the French onion soup and tomato basil soup, two of our favorite soups, but we weren't wowed by any of it. Dessert, however, was pretty amazing. We ordered the triple chocolate meltdown, which is a fluffy and moist chocolate cake with chocolate drizzled over it. It was very good, and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Yes, this is still a chain, yes you'll probably have a similar experience at the Applebee's down the road. This five stars is definitely not on par with some of the fancier restaurants I've bestowed the honor of five-stars upon... But really hear me out: Applebee's is one of the best chains for making crazy requests. I do my best to eat a ketogenic diet so I keep my non-fibrous carbs to a minimum and try to keep my fat content up -- Applebee's is always more than happy to accommodate me and my cray-cray sounding restrictions. Case in point: Tonight the boyfriend and I went and ordered off the 2-for-$20 meal. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and two sirloin steaks. They had no issues with swapping out the tortilla chips that the dip came with raw veggies, swapping out the default mashed potatoes with extra steamed broccoli and didn't judge me when I got my broccoli ""fully loaded,"" with bacon, cheese and sour cream. And this is how they always are -- always willing to go above and beyond to make sure you're getting the meal you want. Applebee's may not be the classiest joint, but for consistency and overall satisfaction, this location is fantastic.

For the last 2 times, I got the same thing.  It was the Bourbon Street Steak (I think the price was 16 dollars?).  The reason I got it again?  Because it satisfied me!  I know the quality of the steak wasn't as amazing as real steak house.  But I'm talking about 10-11 pm Dine-in restaurant... Who else does that you know??  So, I have been happy about this Bourbon Steak I got, which came with grilled mushrooms and onions, and I asked for side of mashed potato instead of baked potatoes. Although I went there late, the service there usually was great... not amazing though.  There were a few times where I had to wait too long for my drink or for someone to walk by, but whatever, it was late so the staffs were shorter than day time.  The server always checked if my steak was cooked right by letting me cut it opened in the middle right after he served me.  He also asked me if I wanted extra steak sauces, which I always got A1 and Ketchup to eat with my steak at Applebee's.   You can tell that I was happy with my meal because I ate everything on my sizzling plate... or maybe I was just hungry?? who knows haha.  All I know is I got full, a bit buzzed and felt relaxing meanwhile watching Sports Center on one of their 4-5 tvs...  The bill came out to be 22 dollars for a steak and beer, reasonable price.   Overall, I have been happy with my experience here.  I'm glad I live close by to it, and I'm sure I will keep going back once or twice a month for late-night steak and beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.024,3.5600000000000005

93,Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114.0,5.0,2016-06-19,Your standard Applebee's in terms of service and food quality. The food is fresh staff is efficient and the location is clean. The location looks to have been recently remodeled and has a less cluttered look then older locations. All in all a decent dining experience. No complaints and 5 stars for what you would expect from Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
101,Lamb588 L.,"Bellevue, WA",0,20,2.0,5.0,2016-06-24,Love their new wood-fire grill steak!  More Juicy and flavorful!  Taste about the same or better comparing to other mid-price-range restaurants in Bellevue!  But at a much more affordable price!  Their baby-back rib is also delicious!  We'll definitely be back for more :-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
100,Stefanie H.,"Kent, WA",16,147,12.0,1.0,2016-07-26,"I never write short reviews EVER but my experience was a year + ago and the only thing that still holds strong in my mind was that i was deeply sickened after eating here at Applebee's. The service was great, the waiter was nice and sat me quickly, they opened the door for me, the restaurant was decently quiet and the food time was somewhat slow but the food was good. Good that is till i got home and became so sick i had to throw up what i just ate and had stomach pains till the next day. But of course whoever cooked my meal that day is either gone or is still working there. I don't know but once a place gives me under cooked food or food that is not acceptable to serve and it gets me so sick to where i waste that $ i just spend on the food to just throw it up, i won't ever be giving them a second chance and i won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

We sat in the bar and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. The apps came out in good time, and everything tasted great. The only thing we didn't like was when a waiter came to our table after we had a few drinks and told us not to drink and drive. While we appreciated the message, he stood there and told us about his experience and it kind of put a damper on the mood of the evening.

84,Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125.0,4.0,2017-04-11,"Stopped in for a quick lunch between accounts.  What started off not so good, turned out pleasant.  Sat down at the bar, perused the menu looking for something that's not too filling but will satisfy my hunger, and settled in on the build your own app.    After waiting about 8 minutes, I was finally greeted by the bartender, and even before I could say hello, was interrupted by another employee asking the bartender a question.   Not impressed by the lack of manners.  Unbeknownst to me, where I sat at the bar, is also used for staging ""to go"" orders and stacking dishes headed to the back room, not a pleasant seat.   Now for the main topic....the food.  My order came out fairly quickly, hot, and was VERY tasty.   For a large chain operation, Applebees is usually very consistent at reasonable prices.     Everyone at the bar but me was greeted by the their first name, so obviously there's a ton of repeat business from locals.  That in itself is a great compliment to the staff (not the guy who interrupted me), the management, and the quality of good, especially when you have so many other options near by.   I'll definitely be back when I'm around this part of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

Maybe that's just me. Anyway, my wife and I had the two for twenty five selection. Starting with the wonderful salad, when Oscar brought it out I turned him away saying we didn't order a salad entree. It turns out that this huge beautiful thing was the salad appetizer. It was beautifully put together with all kinds of greens not just iceberg and bits of tomato, cucumber, bacon and some other stuff. Our entree selection, 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs with fries and garlic green beans, was wonderfully messy and delicious. Oscar our waiter was courteous and attentive with handi wipes, napkins,drink refills and everything else one would want in a professional wait staff. As to price, for what you get it's really inexpensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7,3.28,3.2,3.2,,3.2320000000000007
