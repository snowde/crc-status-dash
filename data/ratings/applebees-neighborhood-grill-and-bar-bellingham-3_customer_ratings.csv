2,Lady G.,"Bothell, WA",2,30,3.0,1.0,2012-01-21,"I've occasionally chosen Applebee's in various places because it was a known quantity.  If I wasn't feeling very adventurous, it was a place to go.  But, after eating at this one, I can't bring myself to go there again *anywhere*.  Even for an Applebee's, this place is horrible -- way worse than any other I've been to.  The food is cold when it comes out, and the service is slow and generally bad.  The food itself is poorly made, even for what it is.  Still, both times my husband and I went, the place was inexplicably packed, so everything was incredibly slow.  It was just a terrible experience all around.

Between burned burgers and iffy service on one trip, to this time we had a 5 minute wait for 2 measly vinegar packets, a server who would walk away after delivering our food so we had to wait 5 minutes just to ask for the vinegar in the first place, fish-stick tasting fish and chips that was supposed to be cod....on top of that when we first arrived the hostess asked whether we'd want the lounge or the dinning area, we said we'd like booths in the dinning area and for five minutes we ended up arguing with her (politely of course because she was being very pushy) about not wanting to go to the lounge. She pushed the lounge to the point where we ended up with a table that was half-booth and half chairs in the lounge, but if you're going to ask where you want to be seated you should NEVER push the area that's the opposite of the customer's answer. I don't know what she was thinking.

The menu is, I will admit, a bit too exhaustive.  I usually turn to whatever is ""hot and exciting"" today.  The ""2 for $20"" deals usually suit me and whomever I am with. The service is usually pretty reliable, the food is good (""good enough""), and the ambiance is what you would expect from a chain restaurant, fine, but not stellar.

Food wasn't cold like other reviewers stated and it was all done how we asked. My only problem was that the food seemed to be covered in pepper. My french fries were completely coated in salt and pepper which was kind of gross.  I got the chicken wrap and it wasn't too spicy, but some bites were.  Someone in my party got the shrimp salad and her shrimp were covered in pepper as well.  It made it almost too spicy for her.  Overall the food was okay, just way too much salt and pepper.  It feels like they are trying to flavor things with it.

30,Andie K.,"Bellingham, WA",2,22,10.0,1.0,2013-03-04,to be perfectly honest - It gets busy here and I don't know why. The wait staff can either be nice or mean but I notice when it is really busy they are usually cranky because they are very busy. It can be a long wait for a table but even when you're seated you still have to wait for them to take your order. Depending on the time of day this can take a while. Portions are small and its well known that they microwave most of their food. Unless you like the atmosphere and don't feel like microwaving your dinner your self - there's really no good reason to go here.

47,Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2791.0,4.0,2014-04-27,"My friend and I decided to stop by on our same-day states trip as we wanted something reasonably priced and I had never tried it before. I've heard of this chain restaurant so I had respective expectations for it. They had a $20 deal going on and that was very attractive to us.  We got there around 6:30 pm and was promptly seated, no reservations necessary (this was a Saturday). It was quite busy but not 100% full. Our waitress was very friendly and patient - no attitude. She could have been a little faster when stopping by for drinks, taking our orders, etc but I guess she had a lot of tables to look after. Still we had no complaints about her service - very personable and conversational. This restaurant had free wifi, which was very slow so I barely bothered with it.  The $20 deal comes with one appetizer and two entrees for two people. Awesome price compared to regular menu price which is already reasonably priced.  Boneless wings, honey BBQ flavour with ranch dip, $9.49 normally: these were breaded chicken breast chunks with a BBQ sauce on them with a dip and celery sticks on the side. I loved these but would have preferred less BBQ sauce. However these were still great - I ate these so fast! Citrus lime 7 oz sirloin, $13.49 normally: I got this medium rare. It came with a plastic stick on the top. The server said this just meant how well it was cooked for the kitchen's benefit, I guess. It came with potatoes that are like breakfast ones, and a side of vegetables (zucchini and beans). I didn't like the potatoes but my friend loved them. The vegetables were good as they wer covered in the same sauce as the steak, which was cooked perfectly by the way. Sauce was so good but a little salty. I was very thirsty after this meal.  My friend got the riblet basket with fries, normally $9.49 I think. This was a huge portion, many rib things and fries. I was not aware of this kind of rib. They had bones throughout and less meat. The sauce was same as the boneless wings. The fries were good. He couldn't finish though as it got boring.  For a chain restaurant, I had a great time. The food was good enough, the service was great, and overall an awesome experience. I left in a really great mood. I don't see why there are so many poor reviews. It's nothing fancy and you can't compare it to something like that. The food came hot and our waitress was nice.  In the future, I would definitely go for the $20 deal again. I would also like to try their happy hour - half prices appetizers from 3-6 and 9pm to close! Also there's a free appetizer if you join their perks thing.

Needless to say this can greatly reduce restaurant choices especially when I'm out of the major metropolitan areas.  Knowing they would take Amex I went to the Applebee's in Bellingham and the food was not horrible. Still what I consider to be under par for the price but better than my last few times at this chain. I must say that the service at this Applebee's was probably the best I've had at this chain. Very good service, friendly attentive waitress. Food was delivered fast and hot.

18,Rebecca P.,"Bellingham, WA",2,17,,1.0,2015-10-05,"I went to Applebee's on Sunset today with my grandfather (who has severe alzheimer's) and my grandmother. Our server was an older gentlemen maybe in his late 40s early 50s who was very pleasant and was a wonderful sever. Our meal came to about $32 with their senior discount and the food overall was a lot better than I remember in the past. As I mentioned my grandfather has SEVERE alzheimer's and it is hard enough taking him places anyways. He lives in the past when 50 cents was a LARGE tip. Whenever we go out to dinner it's a huge fiasco when we pay for the meal and my grandfather will argue until he's blue in the face about leaving a tip and has even gone to the extend of going back to the table as we are leaving to take more money away from the server. My grandmother and I have made it a habit to let him leave a small tip and as we walk out we tip the server more so it doesn't cause a scene. At the end while paying for our $32 meal my grandfather left a $3 tip which in my opinion is insulting  (I've worked in this industry but i NEVER expected anything from anyone knowing how hard times can come up). I had 7 more dollars in my hand to hand to the sever because he was great. As the serve took the money I watched him walk to the register, shake his head, sort of hit his hand down and legitimately through and fit. He looked absolutely on fire....! He wouldn't even look at me when i was trying to get his attention. It was very uncomfortable. I immediately put my money back in my pocket. I get that a small tip can be irritating. I've been there. But to choose this job with the odds of an elderly person giving a small tip and then to visually throw a fit like that was discusting to watch. I will never step foot in a Applebee's again.

Sometimes you get really delicious & well-prepared dishes, but other times the dishes come out tasting pretty bad.  On our most recent visit, we stopped in for a late dinner (around 9ish pm). We had the ""2 for $20"" special - an appetizer to share, and 2 entrées.  The appetizer we chose was the mozzarella sticks. Sadly it was not really well-prepared this time, with the cheese being kinda hard instead of soft & gooey (we have had this here before). I would probably go with the boneless wings next time around, as I've found that they don't seem to mess up on that dish as much.  The entrées we chose this time were the chicken tenders & the cedar grilled lemon chicken. The chicken tenders were pretty hard and overcooked. Lots of breaded crust & not much actual chicken meat. The fries were alright. The cedar grilled lemon chicken, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was served with tasty basmati rice, and topped with cubed green apple bits.  They offer a different selection of dishes in the ""2 for $25"" special, of which I've tried and liked the double crunch shrimp, and the mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. Service is generally OK here. They also have a tablet (at each table) from which you can order, call for your server, or play games. All games are locked behind a pay wall. I believe it was $1.99 per play? Not too sure of the pricing as the selection of games didn't really interest me.

I ordered their burger with a fried egg and hashbrowns which I didn't want but didn't see anything else I did.  The waiter said if I didn't like it, he'd get something else for me at no charge.  My husband ordered a plain burger. My burger arrived and looked pretty pink after I cut it in half.  I ate a couple bites then saw that the entire middle was raw.  I told the waiter who had the manager come over and she offered to get me anything else.  We were trying to get to a family engagement/service so I asked for chicken fingers thinking they would be easy and fast to cook.  They were, but they didn't taste good.   The waiter comped both entrees for us because of this. Tried to pay with the kiosk on the table and it wasn't working. The door was held open for us when we got there and the manager raced us to the door to open it for us as we left and thanked us for coming.

45,Chris K.,"Bellevue, WA",98,10,,3.0,2017-03-07,Been here multiple times and every time we either seat ourselves or wait for minutes with no host... And it's not busy.  Wait staff is under par on the smile points...

41,Alexandra R.,"Bellingham, WA",72,9,3.0,1.0,2017-05-03,"We used to dine regularly at Applebee's. This Applebee's provides terrible customer service. We've tried giving them a second chance and it was just as bad. A bunch of ditsy, inattentive teenagers running the place. We even did the survey and explained our bad experience but got no response and no one attempted to rectify the situation. We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
42,Leena K.,"Bellingham, WA",262,8,2.0,1.0,2017-06-08,I don't know why we continue to go back and try again. I ordered the steak and shrimp. I got my steak and broccoli but the waitress messed up my order so they were cooking the shrimp right away for me. I was pretty much done with the rest of my food when the shrimp arrived. It was seriously raw and covered with whatever they were supposed to cook it with to the point it was a big puddle on the plate. Trying to get the attention of the waitress was pointless. She finally came and asked if I wanted something else. No thank you. They did give me $5 off my meal... But who can't cook shrimp?  My husbands meal wasn't very good either. Food came inconsistent temperatures. Macaroni and cheese was disgusting. Not cheesy (or warm) at all. I will try to remember to never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
12,Lee R.,"Bellingham, WA",3,6,,3.0,2017-06-28,We have had many enjoyable visits through the years at Applebee's.  Tonight was our first real disappointment.  The deep fried chicken appetizer's were rock hard.  We had them split our dinner order of Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken and it was lukewarm and the chicken not completely cooked.  We ordered a salad that came five minutes after our dinner so we sent it back.   We had three different servers which may have caused some of the issues.  The servers and door greeter were very friendly and respectful.  The person hustling people outside at the Alex Lemonade Stand was friendly but to aggresive.  After a customer declined to donate she snapped back that didn't they know it was for children with cancer.  She did not respect the customers space and made others standing nearby uncomfortable.  We had already donated to her but wished we hadn't after that exchange.  Oh well  Life goes on and we will return and know things will be better next visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

46,Ron W.,"Ferndale, WA",0,87,,1.0,2017-07-23,"Stopped here this afternoon for a late lunch (3:30pm) Seated right away. Only a few other customers in the restaurant. Waitress came and asked if we wanted drinks. Ordered a beer and coffee. A few minutes later here comes the drinks. At that point we placed our order. After ten minutes our drinks were empty and no waitress in sight. I decided to push the ""call server"" button at the table. After five more minutes here comes the waitress. I ask for more drinks. Five minutes later she returns with my beer, but the coffee? ""Sorry, we have to make another pot, so it will be a bit"" WTF? Shouldn't your first clue to make more be when your customer orders the first cup? Food was cold and way too expensive.

35,Kevin H.,"Bellingham, WA",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-29,"Wow!! What happened to Applebees?  We've had carside-to-go numerous times, it's always pretty good. Tonight we both had steaks, they were inedible. I started by sharpening my steak knife, thinking it had gone dull, but not so. Once I had sawed off a small chunk, I could not chew it enough to swallow it...toughest steak I have ever tried to eat. It's in the garbage.  Even the fries were chewy. The green beans, on the other hand were absolutely delicious, but so over cooked that I didn't need to chew.  Part of me is tempted to give them another chance, but with so much good food in Bellingham, why bother?  Sorry Applebee's, this is ""Goodbye"". Thanks for the good meals you used to cook for us :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

It was so bad and their food is almost inedible..... their steaks are tough their chicken is chewy their pasta is burnt it's just terrible and their customer service did I mention is terrible terrible terrible terrible.... the server it seemed was too busy flirting with the bartender!!!!

33,PJ S.,"Lynden, WA",78,80,197.0,2.0,2018-01-01,"I'm so bummed to review this way. Per usual, I'll always have positive feedback as well.  My family and I love dining with Applebee's, and their multiple locations. They have always met my expectations and held their reputation.   Our location here has me scratching my head. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by our host in a timely manner. The restaurant was slightly less occupied than expected, so were we happy to be brought to our table in just a short while.  Brandon, our server was a younger waiter, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered our drinks and appetizer, chips and salsa. The kitchen was out of apple juice for the kids, so they enjoyed chocolate milk instead. I had hot chamomile tea, and hubby had a water. Our appetizer, arrived with warm tortilla chips and what tasted like a jar of store bought salsa. This was clearly NOT made in house. It was thick and dry. Not what we remember this dish to taste like. Hubby and I ordered from the 2/$26 menu. Mine, was the meat and potatoes, that tasted alright. The potatoes tasted real fresh, the fried onions were crunchy and the beef was cooked through. Hubby's dish tasted ok too. However, our daughter's kids meal, chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, were completely inedible, that she refused to eat them. I thought they tasted like frozen, store bought cheese sticks, and over cooked/fried chicken. Our other kid's meal was two sliders and applesauce. It arrived as a small patty stuffed in an oversized bread roll and cut in half.  I usually don't criticize the ambiance and loudness of other dining guests, but because we were seated next to the bar area with only a short divider, we were able to hear their conversations!  It was a bit too loud. Which made for an unpleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
