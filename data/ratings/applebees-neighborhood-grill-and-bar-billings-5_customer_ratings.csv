8,Connie Weber W.,"AGUILA, AZ",24,18,1.0,5.0,2012-06-11,"I have been to this same Applebee's twice in 2 weeks and have had  excellent and timely service and great food.  The waiters have been friendly, courteous, and attentive.  Absolutely will  return as we are visiting for the summer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
7,Buzz M.,"Billings, MT",86,425,113.0,5.0,2012-09-04,"Yup.  5-Stars. I don't care if it's a greasy taco stand in San Diego or Gibson's of Chicago.  When 5-Stars are ""earned"", I'll dole them out. Since it opened in the early 90's this particular Applebee's has never been anything but a two or three star (on their best days) restaurant. I'm not sure if ownership changed or there's a new manager in town but upon entering today I thought to myself, ""Self, something is different""! My wife and I were greeted a total of three times on our way to the bar for a ""corner spot"" where we could semi-face each other.  I mentioned to the bartender ""You've remodeled""!  She replied, ""Yeah, a year ago April"". WOW!  Had it really been that long since my last visit?  I guess so.  The new tables and chairs were very comfortable and the entire bar had been redone.  The decor was much better with one wall dedicated to local sports teams instead of the entire restaurant.   It just felt more comfortable. Then menu was updated too but a lot of the old favorites remained. I decided to splurge today and ordered the Bourbon Street Steak w/ New Potatoes.  The wife ordered some chicken thingy off their 550 calorie menu.  According to her, the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist, and delicious. My steak was outstanding and brought to me piping hot!  Cooked to a perfect medium-rare and served over sauteed mushrooms and onions with their signature Bourbon Street spice.  Delicious!  Next time I'll order this meal with EXTRA onions they're sooo good. Our bartender/server was exceptional.  Yes, it was early for lunch, 11:30, but still, she was Johnnie-on-the-spot.  My iced tea never made it half way empty without a refill. 25 minutes after walking in the door we were walking out.  Three farewells on our way out and a 5-star review. Keep it up Applebee's !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
9,L M.,"Billings, MT",1,110,,4.0,2012-09-04,"Had lunch here today. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Dijon and Portobellos. It came with roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables for sides. (broccoli,, carrots and squash or something, not a big fan of those so I don't know which one it was). I loved the chicken, it was really good and juicy, not dry at all. I also loved the vegies, they were steamed perfectly. I don't eat potatoes so I didn't eat those and the squash vegie thing went untouched, but if one likes that sort of thing, they looked like they'd be good.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive, but not overly so. She was there when we needed refills and to ask if everything was ok.  They updated this restaurant awhile back and we haven't been there since so it was almost like going to a new place. Very clean looking and open inside with tvs on the walls, including a really nice one at the bar-very clear picture. They had sports on, which I'm not a big fan of, but kept finding myself looking at the tv b/c the picture was so clear and nice.   They were fast with the service and they opened the door for us when we left. The price was good too. Overall, I liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
6,Bob M.,"Milton, WA",102,415,189.0,4.0,2014-01-07,"nice place to watch a game have a beer, food wise they are a little above average, did like the Sante fe salad it was good, always a fan of their ribblets. I would have to say if your looking to eat healthy this is a good choice they do give you a variety of healthy choices. This was my case, been working on my diet so I can do more of the poor choices for you guys, like the one pound burgers, and 24 ounce t bones. the Salad had good flavor, enough to satisfy but no to stuff your gills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
10,Curt S.,"Sheridan, WY",0,16,1.0,4.0,2014-01-17,"Stopped at this Applebees for an early supper, about 3pm on Thursday. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, however our waitress seemed in a hurry. She was professional and competent though. My wife and I ordered the steak with mushrooms, onions and potatoes. It arrived at the table sizzling hot and I have to admit, it was the best steak I ever ate! My wife agreed! It was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly also! All in all, a superb meal at a reasonable price...one app and two entrees for $24.00!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
11,Lance P.,"Worland, WY",1,32,,2.0,2014-11-07,"Applebees is one of those places that serves OK food with always great service.  There are some good items on their menu but as you might expect with most restaurant chains, nothing that absolutely makes them a destination restaurant.  I have rated Applebees higher before, but this one is about their ""fish-and-chips"".  I'm no stranger to this fare, but here is my take.  The slaw is served with the fish, but it amounts to little more than a sampling you might get at a grocery store open house.. The fish ""chips"" were deep-fried as you would anticipate, but then they were apparently just put right on the plate.  The cooking oil pooled up on the plate making the batter on the bottom soggy and nasty.  Eating those chips was very similar to slurping canola oil out of a spoon.  Where the batter was crisp, the chips were pretty good, but they were crisp on the top and downright disgusting on the bottom.  Not good.  Ok...so the bottom line is that Applebees is OK for most food items, but avoid the fish and chips unless you need a lube job on your digestive system.  Service at this particular place....ALWAYS great!  As for me, its back to the burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,

4,Macayla B.,"Billings, MT",2,20,4.0,4.0,2016-03-10,"I came here with my cousin to just have a girls night and was surprised by a new menu. This menu seemed creative, modern, and small to focus on quality. My cousin and I both had the house sirloin and I asked for mine to be cooked medium, and it was perfect. All in all the food was great and I would rate that a 5. The service on the other hand was slow, cold, and almost nonexistent. Our waitress seemed to have a chip on her shoulder even when we tried to be nice and funny with her. So that was the unfortunate part of the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
2,Stephen A.,"Powell, WY",35,22,2.0,1.0,2016-12-29,"I came here with my wife, brother, his wife and my son while we were Christmas shopping. I have come here multiple times before, but this experience ruined any prior positive experiences for us. We stood by the door for 20 minutes without being seated. The place was nearly empty, so my wife asked what the hold up was, and was told that they would serve us when they got around to it as they were short staffed. Not even a courtesy ""We will be with you."" The hostess just stared intently at the seating chart, ignoring us. We left and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
3,Amber F.,"Billings, MT",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-11,This is the second time i have waited longer than 15 minutes to even get my drink order taken. I sit and watch them help other tables that came in after us skipping me and my two boys more than once. I only come because my boys love it here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,

1,Greg W.,"Billings, MT",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-21,Sub-par service at the 24th street location.  Sat for at least 15 minutes before our waitress came to our table.  I got the impression from our server any question I asked about menu items was dumb.  Anything she asked me was a rhetorical question.  The brisket street tacos were bland at best and soggy.  Ate half of one.  Fries were for sure under a heat lamp for a good 20 minutes.  Never checked our drinks.  Thought I'd give it a second chance but it again was money down the drain.  I tipped accordingly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-5,,,,,
