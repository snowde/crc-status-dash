14,Brynne H.,"Billings, MT",0,6,1.0,5.0,2013-11-13,Absolute amazing service. Our waitress Colleen was amazing to us. The food was wonderful (baby back ribs and a house sirloin) both were seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The atmosphere was marvelous. We'll definitely come again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
13,Bradford D.,"Billings, MT",7,3,,2.0,2014-07-10,I am a little disappointed in this appelbees. It seems like every time I have the steak I wonder whether it will be good today.  There steaks are not consistent at all but I keep thinking it will be good this time. It's sad that you have to cross your fingers every time you order a steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
12,Katherine P.,"Omaha, NE",20,28,36.0,2.0,2014-10-30,"My fiancé and I come in on average once a week, and we may have to go elsewhere. I ordered the cedar salmon last night and was up all evening and half the day hugging a toilet. I think it's time to get a health inspector out there. Obviously there is contamination in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
11,Don E.,"Salina, KS",4,199,8.0,4.0,2015-05-14,The service was fantastic. The steak my wife had and the chicken cheese penne were awesome. The fiesta lime chicken was overlooked and dry. Adding pico and sour cream didn't help.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
10,Randy M.,"Sherwood, OR",0,12,,1.0,2015-07-15,"This was the first Applebee's I definitely will not be returning to eat at. Fr the start I was amazed that they clean the table by just wiping the food and napkins still on the table straight on the floor. Not just our table but after we were seated the did the same for two more tables. Nothing like having to tippy toe around food to get to your table. Very disgusting and no employee seemed to care. Also after wiped down you sat on a Very wet seat and table was very wet.  As for the food, soup was luke warm at best. Salad was also just very plain. Very disappointed and what is sad is it seemed to be routine for this place. It would never happen at others I have been to. Walked out as feeling no one cared and need for a tetanus shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
9,Ashley H.,"Kalispell, MT",39,24,6.0,5.0,2015-09-16,This is nice place to take your family for a casual dining experience. 2 for $20 is a great deal and they have a great happy hour. Yay for $3 Long Islands and half off apps!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
8,G G.,"Helena, MT",0,9,,1.0,2015-09-18,Ordered car side to go - ordered chicken wings for an appetizer ate one and it was raw! Not impressed - food was lukewarm at best. Maybe next time we will have to go in instead of doing take out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
7,Richard L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,1,,1.0,2015-10-07,Food was delivered cold and manager didn't care. Server had to be reminded to bring appetizer. Just horrible service and food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
6,Melody W.,"Chicago, IL",2,106,21.0,3.0,2015-12-16,I use to like Applebee's but I ordered pasta from here and it was horrible. It was very dry felt like the noodles were uncooked. But definitely made me never want to eat from Applebees again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
5,Stan R.,"Shelton, WA",0,23,,2.0,2016-08-23,Staff was polite but service was poor and food was worse. Overall quality was way below what I expect and have experienced with the Applebee's franchise.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
2,Kristin S.,"Llano, TX",14,26,55.0,2.0,2016-08-29,The is only reason I'll give two stars is bc the place was clean and server was friendly..killing time I ordered a burger and a drink..bill came 7.00 over charge...really its me alone..I question my server and of course Josie makes adjustments.. but really its me and me alone.  Frustrating!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
3,David B.,"Sandpoint, ID",3,43,24.0,1.0,2016-09-01,"I have always enjoyed Applebee's. Today though, I was served a Southwestern Steak salad with four small cubes of meat that was counter to the represented picture.  I am a reasonable person and recognize when I am wrong and will acknowledge that when proven wrong. But this was a ridiculously small portion of meat included with the salad. The manager, Cody, said that this was normal and proceeded on his way to attempt to BS a 28 year Deputy Sheriff (I didn't tell him what I did). He said ""I will remake the salad just for you"". When that is said to a customer, it means it has been doctored in an improper manner. I told him that I did not trust him and would not eat the food he had ""customized"" just for me.  As long as that ""manager"" is working here, don't complain about the food or as my strongest professional intuition tells me, Caveat Emptor. I would suspect a contaminated outcome not in your best interest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
4,Emily G.,"Charleston, SC",1,27,31.0,2.0,2016-12-27,Food was okay and came out pretty quick. There were three of us though and only two silverware were brought out. The waitress wasn't that attentive and the check took forever to come.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
0,Kali M.,"Billings, MT",2,55,23.0,3.0,2017-08-23,I don't come to Applebee's for my main meal. I feel the quality of the food is not worth the price that I pay for the food. I do however come here to get their chocolate cake dessert! It's a great place to bring kids to give them a quick but delicious dessert. We usually just sit at the bar and enjoy our dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
1,Meagan R.,"Provo, UT",0,45,4.0,4.0,2017-10-23,"I got the BBQ tacos and they were really great, the flavors were good and the food was obviously fresh. Really the service is my reason for the review, the server was really wonderful and the food came out reasonably fast. I was surprised by the reviews because that was not at all my experience. Maybe I got the one awesome waitress, but hopefully it's because it's turned around since these other reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-billings-6,,,,,
