10,Janeka M.,"Birmingham, AL",9,22,69.0,4.0,2014-10-09,I usually have a great time at Applebee's and this was one of them. I was spending some girl time with my sis and it was great. Our food was good and wonderful service. I guess that could be because we know our server! We had drinks and food plus a happy tummy!!!! :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
8,Patsy B.,"Birmingham, AL",27,19,5.0,4.0,2015-04-08,"I had a good dinner the food was delicious. I enjoyed it very much. My server was very courteous. I would definitely go there again. I ordered the bar special, the brisket nachos, pot stickers and the boneless chicken. I had a Blondie with ice cream for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
11,Kristian B.,"Montgomery, AL",0,2,,2.0,2015-05-23,The service here sucks. I've been here twice in the past few weeks and both visits were horrible. The waitress messed up my tickets on both visits. Keep in mind I had different waitresses. My second visit waitress seemed very dazed out. She didn't check on my table at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
6,Rikesha F.,"Birmingham, AL",175,216,1363.0,2.0,2015-08-03,"Servers and staff are very rude and could care less about working. I try to support restaurants in the city, but not at the cost of good service and good food. I'll take my money and appetite elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
9,Anthony M.,"Birmingham, AL",1,15,8.0,4.0,2015-11-15,Good club sandwich. Nice for a fast lunch. Service was good. Waitress was personable and friendly. Enjoyed eating there. Will go back again soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
5,William M.,"Birmingham, AL",7,32,13.0,3.0,2016-03-08,"Stopped in for bite to eat with a rather large party today. There was the expected lunch hour delay and due to having a large part of about 14 it was expected to have a 15 minute delay. The server was moderately attentive in when taking out order but rather disinterested in the ordering process and mildly annoyed. Once the food came out, it was warm, not hot. The individuals in our party that ordered later received their orders first which I suspect was because the orders were received out of order. I hope in the future the staff and food is to a higher standard if I happen to frequent this location again. I know I shouldn't expect too much from a chain restaurant but that remains to be seen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
7,Candy W.,"Birmingham, AL",18,6,26.0,1.0,2016-05-05,"This was my first time eating at this Apple Bees and I must say that the service was horrible! I understood that it is Cinco de Mayo, and that should be all the more reason why service should have been on a more exceptional level. As we begin to order the waitress tells me to wait until 9, and I wasn't ordering half priced apps. She said she'll return at 9; it was 9:15. When I told her what I wanted, she then tells me, oh you could have ordered that. (Wow). To add injury to insult, when my food finally arrives, the plates is extremely hot and I haven't any cuttery to eat with. I asked for an extra plate and silverware, but was given a disgruntled look. All in all, I will not return, as I said before, I only came with friends,  as I am really not an AppleBee's fan anyway so I am not missing much by not returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
0,Charles P.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,,5.0,2016-05-25,"Ok ok not sure why there are so many negative comments.  This location is perfect.  Some real folks here with real stories.  Applebees never claimed to be as good a s Ruth Chris Steakhouse.  Take a step back and have some respect for the culture here.  People are friendly,  do not come in the door with judgement and you will enjoy your time and food.  I did. Oh and the General Manager is on point I just seen him take care of a customer that said her drink was watered down.  He did not even argue just poured her another drink and took care of her. Excellent customer service!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
4,Marquietta R.,"Homewood, AL",23,10,,4.0,2016-10-03,Usually come to this place on my lunch breaks. The recent menu change was pretty good. Got rid of a couple favorites but added some new ones. The happy hour menu is everything great drink specials. They usually have all the events on their tv's so you don't miss a beat keeping up with the sports. Service is pretty good but I do have my favorites I prefer to go to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
3,Dan J.,"Jackson, TN",44,14,14.0,5.0,2016-11-17,I usually don't like places like this but the server was nice the food came out quick and not too expensive. I had the chicken Cesar salad. This review is not about any of that... Dumb me left their credit card there when I left. Didn't realize I left for several hours later. Called the restaurant they held the card for me and I picked it up the next morning . Thank you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
2,Janet K.,"Birmingham, AL",13,20,47.0,2.0,2017-01-15,"Have been a to~go regular customer for many years without any complaints. Was amazed that my orders were always right compared to my friends' issues with them. The first time I ordered this items I was amazed I was getting such a complex tasting meal from a chain. I have ordered it nine times that were disappointing. Will not need the 10th time to convince me that initial meal can not be duplicated by their current cooks. The first meal's chicken was lightly breaded and crispy. I could taste the protein and enjoy the breading. Since then it has been overwhelming thickly covered poultry. All I taste is grease soaked coating over a thin piece of something. The onion straws are good if eaten there. Otherwise, they are another source of fried fat that becomes soggy due to the steam build up in the to-go container. Their containers are great. My meal was extremely hot when I opened it.  I asked my waitress for extra gravy when I ordered. Since it didn't show on my receipt I refused to close out and add a tip to my credit card until I received my correct order. When I requested extra gravy the second time she didn't apologize or say anything. She went to the kitchen and bought a large to-go sauce container with it less than it 1/4 full of gravy and laid it on the bar and walked away.  I usually leave no less than $2.00 tip no matter what I ordered. I don't calculate my bill before taxes, less alcohol or any of that bs people use to reduce their tip amount. As a matter of fact that may be why I leave a minimum $2 tip to make up for ""those"" cheapskates. However, if all you have to do is take my order and bring it to me and you can't open your mouth to communicate a thank you, I am sorry they didn't get your order right, I will be back, it's hard for even ME to tip you. Especially when you want me to complete my credit card authorization before I get my order!!   Have had some great orders at this location for years. There is a wonderful manager there that has impressed me. When I was leaving I voiced my disappointment to a manager I hadn't seen before and instead of satisfying his customer he tried to make excuses for his waitress. Ok so he and his waitress can be happy together. How long will they have a job without paying customers?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
1,Jenn C.,"Birmingham, AL",76,145,553.0,2.0,2017-06-28,"Had my daughters bday dinner here for convenience and the hope that the food and menu would be better here. Should of went some where else and fought traffic.  The appetizers was the saving grace. The Sriracha Shrimp, Boneless Wings, and Spinach Artichoke Dip was delicious.  My the bday girl ordered the Cedar Salmon and it was very well done there was no moisture in the fish. Her broccoli was bland and under cooked and she's obsessed with broccoli and refused to eat it.  My baby girl loved her Chicken Mac and Mozzarella Sticks I had the 2/$25 with my gf and got the Steak w/ Green Beans and Sweet Potato Mash. That steak was the worst driest cut of meat ever. The sweet potatoes were just ok and once I got my green beans there was dead and covered in bacon and nothing was garlicky about them as advertised. I should've kept that mound of regular mound of garlic mashed potato they gave me.  My gf had the ribs and mac she throughly enjoyed her food and tasted my steak and then apologized and offered to order me something else. Smh.  I had enough bad experiences here to have know better but it will not happen again. I promise.  The menu doesn't appeal to all types of palates and we literally read over it 3-4 times to settle on something",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-birmingham-6,,,,,
