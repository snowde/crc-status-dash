19,Kelsey O.,"Burbank, CA",0,139,,2.0,2013-06-26,Your usual neighborhood Applebee's.  Friendly service with the mediocre completely non-vegetarian friendly menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
17,Nate J.,"Anoka, MN",6,18,38.0,1.0,2013-09-23,"I have not been here recently, but today the service was horrible and the food was mediocre  The server was absent, in the kitchen or out back smoking. The food came and my ice tea was empty, so she took my plastic glass and told me she would be getting me a refill. About 10minutes later she returned and said she was sorry, but said she got sidetracked.  I couldn't believe it she told me she became sidetracked!!!! Really I thought, that is terrible service. Wheres the training and accountability when I am out to eat, expecting what Applebee's should be, paying good money. Obviously not here and never will I ever return here.  This was a Crappybees experience, unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
18,Ryan K.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,3,,5.0,2014-01-29,"Stopped by with a couple friends for some birthday drinks, and as usual it was nothing short of perfect. The wait time is never more than a few minutes during busy hours, and servers are always great. If you go after 8 it'd half price apps and Mondays they have burger and drink deals making already affordable meals very nice. And it is very worth every penny! I almost always get their wings which are on par with Buffalo Wild Wings, if I go away from wings their three cheese penne us to die for. Also, mozzarella sticks are a great start to the meal. Drink wise they have a solid list of domestics and many mixed drinks I always get Grain Belt Nordeast. I highly recommend it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
8,Candace Q.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,6,,2.0,2014-12-30,"To make a list on Yelp, you have to leave a review first. Luckily, I was at an Applebee's when I wanted to start a list (12/28/14). That list being more interesting places than Applebee's to visit. I was planning on leaving a review about how chain restaurants are boring, but reliable and comfortable. I've been here multiple times and had a pleasant, if forgettable, visit. Sometimes I want the environment to fade into the background. However, the 'Bees was did not fade into the background, in a bad way. It got busy, so I'd cut them some slack, but they took all that slack and then some. The beginning of our (I was with my boyfriend) visit was normal enough. It took a little while to receive our food, but nothing crazy. The problems started with the bbq ranch they forgot. It took 10+ minutes for our server to check on us. When he did, we ordered a refill of endless fries, and he started walking away as we reminded him of the ranch. He seemed annoyed, and we never got an apology. I would have bought a drink too, but by the end of it I would have settled for a refill of water. The ranch came soon after, and we were told the fries would be right out. Another 10+ minutes later they finally do come... at room temperature. I don't think they'd even been under a heat lamp. An apology of any kind would have gone a long way, but we only got the sense that no one cared. That's really the worst part. We'll probably be back because we have gift cards, and it hasn't beem this bad in the past, but I'm disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
11,Jennifer W.,"Saint Paul, MN",2,4,,1.0,2015-03-22,"We were seated at a dirty table, she cleared plates and the previous bill off as we were being seated but never wiped it down, so it was still sticky with wing sauce and ketchup. We wait 20 minutes for our waitress to ask if we want drinks, another 20 before she asks if we're ready to order. Then 20 minutes later our appetizers come out, being served by another waiter, forgot the extra ranch, waited 10 minutes for our original waitress to come back so we could get our side. Another half hour for food, served by yet another waiter. Then when we finally do start eating, its all 3 waiters stopping by every 2 minutes. Worst experience ever at an Applebee's!! Food was good, but service was absolutely terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
10,Alisa L.,"Minneapolis, MN",54,3,,5.0,2015-06-24,"I have been to many Applebees and this was the best one we have been at.  The decor was nicely done.  The service was great and the food was looked and tasted delicious.  My Dad, sister and I all choose items off of the new lunch menus and the food looked just like the pictures and tasted great.  We definitely recommend this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
9,Mary N.,"Minneapolis, MN",22,96,124.0,3.0,2015-08-02,"Food here is ok, I feel like people go here more for their happy hour specials. Mediocre would be the perfect word to describe the food here.   Half off selected appetizers,  2 for 9.99, 3 for 12.99, 2 for 20-25 dinner options. They have good deals going on as well as drink specials.  I came here with a large group that all came at different times & our server never asked the new arrivals for drinks,  I literally had to flag her down &ask her. We didn't really eat much, just ordered a lot of drinks & a few of us ordered food.  Don't order food through the menu on the computer if you're ordering appetizers,  they don't apply to the 2 for 9.99 or 3 for 12.99, with each additional being 3 dollars. Order through your server.  Our tabs were all stuck together and complicated because we ordered through it too.  Again,  I feel like Applebee's is only good for their happy hour.  Definately, order through your server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
16,Calvin K.,"Bethel, MN",0,6,,4.0,2015-10-12,"I love this place. I just ordered the Alfredo pasta 2 for $20. The reason it did not earn a full star review from me is because the breadsticks. Typically I love these breadsticks but this time I was slightly disappointed due to the lack of flava in ya mouff. Regardless of these minor issues, I will without a doubt be back again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
13,Chelsea M.,"Lakeville, MN",0,3,1.0,1.0,2015-11-29,"Website says happy hour is 3-6 and 9-close. I get there and the staff I talked to was super rude and says that they are a franchise so they don't need to honor their website and that the happy hour there is only until 5 and not 6 like what the website says. This normally wouldn't be a big issue to me, but I was blown away with how rude the staff was about it. This was my first and last time coming to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
15,Jason S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-11,"One of the worst experiences in customer service I've ever had came at this Applebee's location this past weekend. I walked into the restaurant which was not busy at the time with a party of 6 for lunch. The host at the front asked me to wait a minute and then disappeared into the back. Then a large group came in which had called ahead some time in advance which they were completely unprepared for. They proceeded to seat the people in the group but asked them to break into smaller groups of 6-10. We asked if we could be acknowledged and at least get put on a list and was rudely scolded by some employee named Kim the group takes priority since they called ahead and that they would get to us after a while. All we were looking for was to be put on the list to be seated but after the way we were treated, we promptly left and went to Texas Roadhouse down the road where we were happy to spent twice as much money for way better service.  I'm not sure that I can bring myself to give this place another chance after that experience. So disappointed!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
14,Tee V.,"Brighton, CO",0,74,5.0,2.0,2016-05-11,"Just got off work and decided to sit down and enjoy a little family dinner. Service was good, but the food, different story. We decided on the 2 for 25. Yes they added sides to the main dishes now but the main dishes themselves were not good. The baby back ribs (4) were dry, you can tell it has been sitting for a while. Hard to chew and no where close to fall off the bone. NOT FRESH AT ALL. The supposedly side dish (garlic sauce beans) lacked flavor. My dish was some chicken dish. I sub out the red potato for the rice. The skillet that the food came in was very hot. Seemed like they just put it in the oven and reheated them up. Overall the dessert was the best part although we had some confusion upon ordering it. The server asked if we wanted dessert even telling us that the menu is on the back of a menu on the table, but minutes later came back with our receipt (threw it on the table while trying to help another guest), while we waited she only came back to ask me if i wanted a refill on my beer only to then realize we were still sitting b/c we wanted a dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
6,Daniel T.,"Blaine, MN",11,18,10.0,3.0,2017-01-02,"The two for $20 deal is nice. An appetizer and two entrees for $20. Got the appetizer, had to ask for plates. When we got them they were dirty. Asked for new ones, waited, waited, finally got them. Appetizer was cold by then. Asked to have it remade.  The waitress had it remade and also had our entrees remade since they were just coming out as well. Good to see a waitress do the right thing and turn a bad situation into something good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
4,Paige T.,"Rochester, MN",4,54,3.0,1.0,2017-03-30,"I have to start by saying that there are some great people who work here, but my experience today was bad. I almost have no words because literally no one waited on us. We were seated by the lovely host so props to her for being super friendly. But we sat at our table for 10+ minutes and no waitress even brought us waters. When we finally saw our server she looked at us and said ""I'll be right there folks"" and then proceeded to walk away and clear tables while we sat and waited more. Needless to say, we walked out. Boooooo",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
5,Kristie E.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,1,,5.0,2017-06-17,"I went here with my celiac daughter. The waitress (I believe her name was Kerra) was very  knowledgeable about Celiac and the necessary accommodations that were needed. She notified the kitchen staff and went over the menu options with us. She notified the manager and he came by to make sure our questions were answered. It's not easy to dine out with Celiac, so I certainly appreciated all of their efforts to ensure our safety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
3,Robert S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,3.0,2017-07-02,"Service just ok. Not many people in restaurant still had to sit in a booth next to bar and front door with a lot of noise. Waitresses and helped were talking loudly close by us instead of in the back room somewhere where we did not have to hear them. Ordered my steak medium came to me well done. Was never asked how my food tasted. Only if it looked okay as they served it. Never asked if everything was okay. On the plus side the macaroni and cheese with bacon was delicious, fries were great ,wifes salad was perfect and the frozen lemonades were really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
7,Deby B.,"Blaine, MN",3,1,,1.0,2017-10-01,"Never had an issue before tonight when i went there for a nice dinner with my friend and her son. It was going fine until we revived out appetizer put no plates, napkins or silverware.  Asked a server for some and when we got it they gave us used napkins with silverware rolled up in it. Pointed it out to the server who brought us all new silverware and napkins, unfortunately the silverware was not clean. Then came the over half hour wait for the rest of our food, only to find out from that a cook walked off the job and the general manager was cooking.  When our food finally arrived the kids meal was one cheeseburger short, they brought extra warm fries for my burger and there was something hard in my friends pasta meal. The management did slash our bill in half but really I feel we should have been comp for the whole meal. This is unusual as I normally have a great experienced when I eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-blaine-2,,,,,
