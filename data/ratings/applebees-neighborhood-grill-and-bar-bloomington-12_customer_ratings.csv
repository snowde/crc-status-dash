9,Mahva J.,"St Paul, MN",60,329,48.0,2.0,2013-04-04,"Please take my review as it comes. I, admittedly, call Applebee's 'Crapplebee's' and have extremely low expectations of the chain. I go to these places because they are convenient for work lunches out in the burbs. Otherwise, I don't set foot in the place. I tried their new Parmesan shrimp, which was ok. I, and my lunch companian both, had requested half the rice (I'm generally strict about how much starch/carbs I eat), and we were told that everything was pre-portioned. I didn't say anything, though I wondered how hard it could be to scrape off rice from a plate, which is what we both did. This was the first dish at this chain that wasn't overly salted. I was pleasantly surprised at this. The steamed broccoli was great, though it's not that hard to cook. So, if you're into salty chain food, this is a choice you have. I'll probably be back in the next quarter, which seems to be the frequency at which I'm forced to eat here. One does get sick of the Olive Garden (I eat one thing there), as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
7,Lila C.,"Minneapolis, MN",135,256,108.0,2.0,2013-07-27,"This is the definition of the suburbs.  I end up frequenting this Applebee's, located in Bloomington on Lyndale near my parents house, several times a year for its convenient location to meet up with friends.  Rain, shine, snowstorm, holiday or weeknight, this place is as busy as a beehive. Half off apps and bar-go keeps the young teens, suburnites, and school and church groups coming by the boat load.  Despite Applebee's steps in the recent months to make their menu more gourmet the food is still the same, the typical calorie loaded american chain food. I would say the highlight of this location are the characters they like to call servers/waiters. You name it, they got it: straight out of Office Space, overly friendly high school teen, or (slightly drunk)  cougar types - at least it never gets old. One piece of advice, steer clear of the dessert shooters. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake once because I couldn't commit to a whole dessert and I thought this would be a good middle ground. The fact that 'shooter' is in the name was a telltale sign. I took one bite then spit it out because it was not edible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
10,Kevin N.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,,5.0,2015-12-24,"They greeted our family with a nice ""merry christmas"" that made our day happy when we had to go to the mall for 6 straight hours. The waitress is nice. I recommend you to go to this place more often and bring your family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
8,Michelle M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,12,,1.0,2016-01-10,Haven't been here in years because didn't think the food was very good. I guess something's don't change!  My husband ordered the mushroom burger and we had better at Wendy's not very well season didn't get dressed with lettuce or tomato.  I had the oriental chicken grill salad.  The chicken was either dry or burnt in the ends.  The dressing was very oily and missing basic flavor like salt.   We ordered pick up so can't comment on the service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
11,Mer V.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,,1.0,2016-04-24,"April 24th Sunday at 8:18 we went to the bar to get some drinks. Sat at the bar watch numerous servers walk past, then the manager walk past us twice within a span of 10 minutes and no one would help us. The sad part is we were the only two at the bar. This place sucks if your thristy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
6,Elizabeth G.,"Wiscasset, ME",0,3,,5.0,2016-05-16,"An overall excellent experience. Wonderful handicap parking just in front of door. Excellent service and nice portion size ( burger was just the right size, can hold it in one hand and not have it slop all over). Sweet potato fries very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
4,Kenneth W.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,3,4.0,2.0,2016-07-30,Learned my lesson for the last time don't order meat here it's never done properly.  The macaroni and cheese and the burgers as well as the appetizers are the only things I have had so far that they cook decently,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
5,Julia S.,"Elk River, MN",0,3,,5.0,2016-12-11,"Just had an awesome experience here.  The food was good, but the real reason I'm giving this five stars is because of Rio (Dario/David ) he was outstanding.  I don't live anywhere near Bloomington, but I'll go out of my way to come here again because of him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
3,Sara H.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,9,,3.0,2017-03-21,We've been here over an hour and are still waiting for our main course. Glad I wasn't in a hurry tonight. Never again.........

0,Jeanine P.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,12,6.0,4.0,2017-11-01,Torn between a 2 or 4 star rating. Depends on what the rating is for: bar service (4) or food (2). I rated on bar service.  Stop by here often for an adult beverage. Always sit at the bar and the bartenders are great fun.  Not impressed with food in general. Seems to be very heavy. Order chips and salsa tonight and chips were very rancid. Yuck!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
1,Steve S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,59,38.0,1.0,2017-12-22,"Stopped in for a beer and some half price apps. I hadn't been in an Applebee's in probably at least 5 years and now I remember why.  Wow does this place need a refresh of their quality. Our group split the artichoke dip, quesadillas and the boneless buffalo wings. Let's take them one by one...the spinach artichoke dip was watery and seemed puréed. Not horrible, but not good either. Just a thought, but make the dip more fresh tasting and serve with pita and skip the cheapo chips. The quesadillas tasted like something an elementary cafeteria would serve. Totally bland and devoid of any distinct texture.  I'm not sure even if it was grilled. No sour cream, no guacamole, just 4 quarters of a thin tortilla and a catsup size dish of salsa.  Now the boneless wings. They are quite possibly the worst wings I have ever had. They had a chili glaze and could have doubled as a Chinese food sweet and sour chicken. They had a puffy coating and a small piece of chicken on the inside. They were cold and the blue cheese in the side tasted off, almost like a tartar sauce.    Chris the server was nice and did a good job. Glad I had a beer to help offset the disappointing apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-12,,,,,
