41,Jeremia F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",218,421,61.0,1.0,2012-09-21,"Came here on a Sunday night and was completely baffled by how bad everything . I understand that it is a Sunday and that  means football this time of year but why can't you get your act together. We were seated pretty quick but it took forever to get a server to stop by our table and then the drinks never came until we were therefor at least 30 minutes. I order one of the lighter fare options because everything else at Applebee's is at least 1200 calories with no real nutritional value.The steak I ordered was way over cooked and considering I couldn't even get a manager's attention to come over and address my dissatisfaction with my meal I choked the tough flavorless hunk of meat down the hatch. The side of ""Grilled"" shrimp were repulsive, They were essentially precooked salad shrimp that were sauteed and then possibly thrown on a flat top for 2 minutes to make them appear to have been grilled. It was ridiculously bad and I can't recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bohemia-2?start=40,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

Service: Was really great; I was surprised. 5/5 stars.  Mood: this was the first time I've ever ate near a bar, and it was really obnoxious. There were people yelling, cursing, and laughing very loudly. I think one of the staff may have even done this too. 2/5 stars. Food: All of our (three in total) meals were asked to be well done. Parts of our meals were medium-rare, even at times rare. We hypothesized that they were rushing the cooking, because my burger was only medium-rare at some of the edges.

Among these types of restaurants ( Fridays, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday's) , I think Applebee's is one of the worst.  However, I do come here sometimes because the location is convenient for me. The burgers are pretty good.  The fries could be better. The Appetizer sampling trio is a ripoff.  I ordered that for lunch one day.  $15.99 for 2 small sliders, mozzarella sticks, and a few boneless wings?  Should be closer to ten bucks, especially since the boneless wings were not that good and did not come with blue cheese or anything.  Mozz sticks could have been cooked for another minute.  Service is ok, but a bit slow.

14,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",318,759,47.0,3.0,2014-09-28,"Shouldn't every neighborhood have a bar and grill? Fortunately for those lacking, the good people at Applebee's marketing department fill the void. The deeply existential search for community ends as soon as you enter. And based on what I've seen during my few stops at this particular Applebee's, the neighborhood, especially the indigenous teenager, are socializing, eating and drinking here. (Not necessarily alcohol for the under-aged of course) I must confess that my sole purpose at stopping at this particular Applebee's is that it makes for an ideal pit stop half way from my point of origin to the final destination in Amagansett/Montauk. And unlike plenty of non-chain mom and pop artisinal buzz word embracing eateries, not once have I had anything but attentive, downright friendly service.  Teenagers seem to flock here in droves but they apparently work here too. And the ones that work here smile! Yes, they flash the pearly whites, they speak clearly and bring me what I order in a timely manner. For all I know there may be not a drop of sincerity to everything I have described but the illusion is certainly there.  As an occupant of the metropolis, where bathroom cleanliness ranks from dirty to filthy to pornographically obscene, this Applebee's is next to godliness. It's amazing what a distance of 20+ miles outside of Manhattan can accomplish. Of course, the astute observer realizes I have dropped not a single word about the food in this review. I did once enjoy a steak here and was shocked by the presence of char. The potential to add thousands of calories to your diet can be realized from appetizers to dessert. The health conscious can opt for the ""Weight Watchers"" menu items. I did this once and will likely not do so again not from any flaw in the dish but because there's something a bit unholy about entering an Applebee's and not ordering at least one pig out friendly dish. (Perhaps if I was a regular who lived in the neighborhood and this was truly my neighborhood bar and grill I would be more likely to eat healthier.) As a visitor, however, I'll stick to the dips, wings, quesadillas and other modern American comfort foods that are the specialty here. You don't go to a steak house for fish and you don't go to Applebee's to count calories. Non-hateful service, a non-vile bathroom and a road trip break location give this establishment three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bohemia-2,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
22,Evonna A.,"Queens Village, NY",36,249,38.0,5.0,2015-03-09,I have not eaten at Applebee's in such a long time. I stopped by this location for lunch today and had the BEST experience I ever had at a chain resteraunt.  I walked on the door and was greeted by the manager and hostess with great big smiles and welcoming personality.  I was seated swiftly and served immediately. The waitress took my order and offered her advice when I couldn't chose what I wanted.  I also ordered something to go and I didn't even have to ask for it they wrapped it up and brought it with the bill.  It was very refreshing to have such great service and delicious food. Felt great!

15,Kathryn B.,"Nesconset, NY",18,75,24.0,3.0,2015-12-22,"I got an Applebees gift card for Christmas and my daughter got a coupon for a free sundae for some achievement at school so we went there tonight.  I'll preface this review by saying that a couple of weeks ago I'd seen a commercial on TV for all You can eat enchiladas for  $9.99 and I THOUGHT it was an Applebees commercial so I went into the one in Bohemia & asked the host ""do you have all you can eat enchiladas for $9.99?"" He didn't know so he grabbed a passing waiter and asked him ""Yeah! We have that!"" The waiter chirped enthusiastically.  So I sat down and when the waitress came by, that was what I ordered.  But SHE said they don't have that so I left,  kind of annoyed . My mistake it turned out to be Chili's running that promotion.  So back to tonight. Server was friendly. Food was delicious (I got the steak and onion with potato which was altogether 600 calories. ..and no, I wasn't trying to count calories the night I was chasing the all You can eat enchiladas). My problem with Applebees tonight was related to the ipad tablets they have on the table now. It has the menu on it and you can order straight from the tablet without having to be inconvenienced by waiting an additional 30 seconds for your server to come around. According to John Tesh, the restaurants are having these now because people  subconsciously order more food when they don't have to do it to a human being. When they can hide behind a tablet they tend to pile on the apps and the fatty foods rather than saying oh I'll just take a salad with the dressing on the side, trying to look cute in front of a person. Kind of like how when I go to Subway sometimes if the sandwich artist is not very attractive I'll get a footlong but if they are cute then I will be coy about it and just get a six inch even though I'm still hungry and when I'm done. So my 7 year old daughter was playing with the tablet which I saw no harm in, and she said ooh! there's games on this! And she started to play the games, which was fine with me because they seem to be just something to keep the kids occupied while waiting for their food just like how they have the coloring page & the crayons. So I let her play the games on there. Well... When the bill came there was an extra $2 on it for playing with the games on the on the tablet. That is complete BULLSHIT. They should not charge for that but if they're going to they should warn customers that the games are not free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bohemia-2,,,,,

Everytime I have gone to this location theres wrappers & napkins on the floor and the tables are oddly sticky.  This location seems to attract a younger crowd, and it tends to get rowdy on a Friday or Saturday night after 10pm. Normally I wouldn't mind a young crowd, but when underage teens are flirting with the waitresses and trying to buy alcohol it could get aggravating to hear that while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. And the spitballs that are being flung from table to table isn't appealing to me.  As for the service...very slow and it seems like it takes ages to order another drink or get anything in a timely fashion.  The food is mediocre. Sometimes it's decent, other times it's a disaster. Also, don't bother ordering alcoholic beverages here, yes they don't charge much...and that's how they get you. The drinks are very weak.

As it has never been in there before and reconfirmed on the menu I asked her to give me a taste and with 100% certainty there was bacon throughout. She asked for a manager and when he came over he never once apologized for the mishap. He searched through her salad pointing out what everything was and trying to make my wife feel like a liar.  Nope that's an almond. Nope that's a carrot. My wife slams the salad down in front of him and with her bare hands rummages through a salad and picks out 10 pieces of savory pork bacon and begs him to eat it right there. Still not one sorry. Just the old it's a kitchen and there are bacon bits back there. My wife is a vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian meal and you treat her as if she was lying. Then give me 10$ coupon. Get real.

I tried the blackberry lemonade at the recommendation of our waiter and it tasted good. The blackberries were fresh but I really didn't taste the lemonade. I wasn't thrilled when I saw that it was appx $3.00 for the drink NO refills.  I had to switch to water. I won't order it again bc I felt the price was too high for a singular sugary drink.  I ordered the 4 cheese Mac with chicken tenders and it was pretty good. The sauce reminded me of a vodka type sauce and bacon bits cooked within.  My kids got a side of fries and a small kids meal burger. They looked like they were cooked perfectly.  The biggest disappointment was my wife's dish. She ordered some chicken dish with onion rings and mash. I'm not sure if it's a relatively new dish but my wife could instantly tell the chicken wasn't cooked right.  I checked it out, definitely overcooked and chewy/rubbery. It was not edible. She had to leave it on the plate.  I feel like this is the second time that this location has over cooked chicken dishes that her and I have ordered.  Assuming the chicken is over cooked I can only assume it's a volume issue in the kitchen cooking multiple items at once so I gather it's one temp cooks all on the stove.  Our waiter did the right thing and took it off the bill but it would have been nice if they surprised us with a desert. They did offer to make something else.

12,Jessica P.,"Bohemia, NY",0,1,,5.0,2017-05-14,"Honestly this Applebees is amazing.  It is my go to spot for any type of meal.  Whether a nice filling dinner or a late night snack, you can't go wrong. My boyfriend and I know the staff and we are greeted with amazing customer service every time.  I'm writing this review after having the best burger of my damn life.  The new caprese mozzarella burger was incredible and for a great price.  After I finished I had to wash my hands because of the greasy deliciousness.  Also, the cookie Sunday is a date night favorite.  It's perfect for two and melts like heaven in your spoon.  I just wanted to say I'm 100% satisfied every time and express my gratitude for this amazing restaurant.  Shout out to Seth for being the best waiter ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bohemia-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

Then had the manager bring that beer and when she returned with our regular drinks she threw the straws on the table angrily and asked for our order and my friend who is a little soft spoken tells her and she yells at her saying"" you need to speak up i can't hear a damn word your saying"" which at that point we all knew it was going to be a terrible night. She rarely checked in on us and when she did she still had that terrible attitude. This is also the second time we had her and the first it was just my s.o and I and she completely abandoned our table for the hour we were seated and thankfully we had the small tablet that we could order and pay our check on because after she got our drinks she never came back. I have never had a problem with any other server so watch out if you get eileen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bohemia-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
