10,Charles R.,"Lafayette, LA",0,2,,5.0,2013-07-15,I've been to Applebee's a hundred times I like the service I like the food and I enjoy atmosphere and I could truly say that I love Applebee's and its a GO.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,
8,James S.,"Boone, NC",5,6,1.0,3.0,2013-12-28,"Long islands were okay, not top shelf, and for 3.99 theyre exactly what you expect. We initially sat down to have a few drinks, an app and a meal. The boneless buffalo wings were dry, and seemingly microwaved. Not what youd expect for 10 dollars for an appatizer. Ended up getting main course elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,
6,Heather N.,"West Jefferson, NC",71,13,6.0,5.0,2015-10-08,"Used to eat at the Boone Applebees ALL the time years ago, but actually had not been there in probably at least 2-3 years. Wow, they have improved.  I know its a chain so you know what you are getting, but the food has improved.  I have ate there twice in the last two weeks and both times ordered the 7oz Sirloin Steak.  It was so good both times.  Melts in my mouth.  The service has been awesome too!  Both times.  Ate there today and my waitress was GREAT!!!  She brought my food and kept my drink refiled SUPER fast.  My steak was perfection, but when I took a bite of the mashed potatoes they were a little cold, took another bite and it was a little cool too.  My waitress came over and asked how the food was, I told her about the potatoes, but I took another bite and it was hot.  She asked if she could bring me another dish of mashed potatoes, I told her no, they tasted great and I would just mix them up and they would be fine.  About a minute and half later here comes one of the Assistant Managers with a huge dish of piping hot mashed potatoes.  She said that my waitress was concerned because mine were cold..  I told her it was not that big of a deal, but she was very nice and said no one wants cold potatoes.  Very impressed with the customer service.  Will definitely be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,

4,Heather K.,"Hickory, NC",0,4,,2.0,2016-10-24,"No No and No!Server was awful.He was very in inattentive and just slack.Seen him when he took order , bought our drinks and asked for a straw twice and never bought it.Finally bought food , had no napkins or utensils and told lady that bought out food that .She said she'd get it,never did.Flagged manager down and she apologized and bought us silverware.Server didn't refill drinks and was just nonchalant about his job.Food was good, but doubt coming back to this place.Manager was nice though and  took money off the bill",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,

0,Sarah T.,"Rock Hill, SC",86,9,,4.0,2017-02-07,"Walked in, and the hostess & a manager were having a personal conversation. Manager sat my boyfriend & I and wasn't very friendly. It was Super Bowl night and our server had a packed section and was very busy but managed to be attentive to us and was quick the whole time there. He kept our drinks full and made sure we were happy. I think he was a manager/supervisor as well, he was in a red shirt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,
2,LaMisha H.,"Stockbridge, GA",46,2,,1.0,2017-03-05,When we were seated the table was visibly filthy and we were seated anyway. I asked the host to clean the table she sprayed the cleaning solution on the table and sprayed my arm. By which she never apologized and walked away to find paper towel.  I ordered a Margarita. The drink had foreign objects floating around in it and there was still residue  from another drink in the inside of the glass..I felt so sick! I brought it to the attention of my server she notified management. I waited 20 mins for a replacement drink. When I recieved it same thing minus the residue at this point I was ready to go! My children consumed their drinks and appetizers. They didn't receive any . We saw our waiter all of two times in 40 mins. OMG. And then I had to wait another 30 mins to recieve my bill. Very disappointed with the lack of sanitation. I truly hope that neither my children and I recieve any foodborn illnesses because of the poor sanitation conditions of this resturant. I will never come to this Applebee's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,
1,Hannah L.,"Blowing Rock, NC",12,26,3.0,2.0,2017-09-26,"This is one of the few places in town that has stayed the same over the years and so I have been there many times. My family and I went recently and it was an interesting experience. The waitress we got was very nice but she brought us the wrong drinks even after we told her they were wrong they still came back as the wrong drinks. That was fine we can drink mostly anything so we order and my mothers steak comes out with pink in the middle while my mom asked for no pink so they do another one and this one is crusty on the outside and pink in the middle. We didn't want to argue about it so we all ate our meals, everyone else's was delicious. I got a chicken dish with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was sooooo good. All around this experience was below what I wish it had been and I can't wait to go back to see if they have gotten better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boone-3,,,,,
