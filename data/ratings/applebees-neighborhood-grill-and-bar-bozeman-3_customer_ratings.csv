18,Flip S.,"Pahrump, NV",2,49,12.0,1.0,2012-09-09,"Going downhill....I keep trying, but Applebees keeps disappointing.  Cold soup, cold food in general - it sits around I guess while an overwhelmed server-staff gets to it. Coagulated cheese never inspired me.  Slow, slow service.  What a shame. After four meals all the same, I have stopped going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
13,Nicorie S.,"Bozeman, MT",22,153,41.0,2.0,2012-09-22,"Ate here for lunch with my husband and two wee ones. Off the bat, our drink of choice (or anything like it) wasn't stocked in their bar, so that was kind of a bummer.  Then, our waitress brought us dirty appetizer plates. The food was hit or miss and our waitress was a bit slow. Music was blaring in the bathroom and the air conditioner was on full blast. I'll probably return if invited out; otherwise, I don't plan on returning on my own accord. Things that could make it better: - proper restaurant training for all employees - better management",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
21,Stacy D.,"Bozeman, MT",1,27,2.0,1.0,2013-01-01,my family went there last week. it was so disappointing! the food was cool to the touch after waiting almost an hour for the food to arrive. all of the food was cool to the touch. because itwas nine at nite they probably had pulled the food from the steam table. bad manager didn't even seem like he cared. never going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3?start=20,,,,,
20,Jocelyn P.,"Federal Way, WA",0,55,,1.0,2013-08-05,"Went for dinner on July 28th, were waited on by an approx. 6 foot+ blonde lady with a big birthmark on the back of her calf.  Didn't catch her name.  We ordered dinner and while we were waiting 4 other tables that came after us all got their food.  Our server didn't come back to our table after we ordered till about 40 minutes later and asked if we wanted dessert.  Duh, where is our dinner?  All we got was our original drinks, no refills, and someone else brought my salad, that was it.  Our drinks and my salad was comped and we left,  we didn't want to wait any longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3?start=20,,,,,
17,Ted M.,"Bozeman, MT",0,9,2.0,5.0,2013-10-15,I ate here and I was delighted by my service. Quality food with good management and young bright servers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
12,Stephanie C.,"Spanaway, WA",31,119,784.0,3.0,2013-12-24,Was a great place. They took such good care of me and my family. Next time I am in Bozeman I would defo stop back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
16,Chris B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",86,436,516.0,4.0,2014-02-21,Came in for lunch and was promptly greeted by the server (forgot her name but she had a cast on her wrist) who took me to my booth. Personable and friendly. Got my drink and ordered the Bacon Blu cheeseburger. The server was terrific and the food was delicious. She was fast with a soda refill and really seemed to enjoy her job. The facility was clean and well run. What can I say? It was a terrific experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
14,Denis M.,"Butte, MT",0,12,1.0,1.0,2014-12-06,"To day me and two others met at the Applebee's in Bozeman. All party arrived at 12:00 pm. We were seated right away, there were plenty of tables and no lines. The hostess was very nice. Our server came and got us our drinks, and came back in about 10 minutes to take our order. Our order supposedly was in around 12:10 pm. About 15 minutes later one member received her French Onion soup. 20 minutes later the rest of the meal arrived. My grilled cheese sandwich was old. Yeah true it was 12:00 pm when we arrived but there was plenty on empty tables, and no folks waiting to be seated. Basically it took our meal way to long to arrive. And we never did see a manager in Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
8,Mark M.,"Torrance, CA",10,47,36.0,5.0,2015-01-11,"My first 5! And at a applebees! Lol. I wasn't hungry at all, ordered the chicken with portobello mushroom w/ potatos, and a wedge salad. After I ate the wedge salad thought I was done but then then the magic came out. The potatos included in the chicken dish had the skin peeling off, and they tasted like a super thin crispy but moist potato chip. The potato itself was perfect, not dry at all.  I asked the waiter what's going on with these magical morsels, he said they are flash boiled, skin partially peeled, then fried. larger flake type of salt seasoning added afterward. It was cooked perfectly. I've eaten at applebees perhaps 10xs and have never ever had anything like this. Hats off to the chef! And the service was great and friendly. I sat at the bar watching the football game and the bartender knew everyone's name as they walked in..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
15,Julie A.,"Emigrant, MT",0,44,,1.0,2015-02-17,"I finally tried Applebees the other night, and it was just as bad as I thought it would be. My server was AWESOME and the food came quickly, but otherwise there's nothing good to say. Our cocktails were terrible, food was bland, and in general it makes me sick that people would go here when, for the same price (and maybe better) they could support one of Bozeman's fabulous local restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
11,Alanna V.,"Bozeman, MT",0,4,,2.0,2015-08-24,"In the past, we've had who we think is the best server in Bozeman. He was a man in his mid-twenties, who we swear had a photographic memory, and who always put his A game on. Unfortunately, the last few times on our excursion to Applebees it seems the service has gone down hill. The waitress we had over this last weekend was absolutely amazingly horrible to say in the least. Not only was she moody, but the impatience was written all over her face. Asking a question about the menu was clearly too much of a hassle for her, and we were received with a bitter huff and gruff. The steak we ordered was definitely not made to order, there's a big difference between a medium steak and blue-rare steak, and clearly the cooks don't have this down. One other thing, a waiter/waitress should ask if refills are wanted on pricey drinks instead of assuming. Neither of us wanted refills, and we definitely did not want to be charged for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
10,Dennis M.,"Bozeman, MT",21,86,7.0,2.0,2015-09-12,"Nice looking full ""glossy"" menu and great photos, but execution definitely lacking.  The Fiesta Chopped Salad looked like a non-appealing pile of salad mix put thru a chop food processor and dumped on a plate.  I specifically asked for hot fresh french fries with my American Burger (it was good) BUT I got luke warm ones, at best. The waitress was embarrassed. I told them they would be much better served throwing away such ""sitting around waiting"" fries and making and serving a new batch.  Not worth losing a couple of customers over 15 cents worth of potatoes.   :-(    Don't think we'll be back, even though we are locals.  Too many WAY better choices in Bozeman.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
7,Jon D.,"Bozeman, MT",0,6,,4.0,2016-05-08,"My family and I had lunch on a busy day (Graduation Day at MSU) and we had a wonderful experience. Our server was Sheila H., and she was very attentive and genuinely nice! We have eaten at this Applebee's before and had Sheila H. take care of us in the same outstanding manner. Our food was a hit all the way around. The Southwest Steak Soup was delicious. My family left full and happy! Thank you Applebee's! The vast number of pretentious Bozeman restaurants really could learn a thing or two about customer service and quality experience from Applebee's. We look forward to going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
9,Ann O.,"Ventura, CA",0,29,9.0,4.0,2016-09-14,"Walked in here from my hotel starving and sat at the bar staring at the drink menu. Hadn't been in an Applebee's in quite a few years so I didn't know the menus. Is super friendly bartender named Craig came up and asked if he could take my drink order I asked him what he recommended for the margaritas and he suggested their top notch one and it was super! He was such a sport when I told him I was hungry but there wasn't much on the menu I could eat as I am Vegan. I am giving this review for stars because they did not have guacamole and that is my go to for food on a menu that is not vegan friendly. That and french fries and salsa and chips. Craig said he could have them fix me a decent side salad with broccoli and tomatoes and cucumbers with a vinaigrette which was really good. Between the salad and the chips and salsa it took the edge off my appetite. I should've ordered french fries as well. Thanks Craig, for making my drink and snack great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
5,Cory R.,"Dutton, MT",1,5,2.0,4.0,2016-09-17,We stopped in after a Saturday Bobcat football game.  There was no wait for our group of four.  The server was very friendly and did a nice job.   I ordered a tall crown and water.  It came in a very tall glass.  Too much water for a single shot of whiskey.  I would have preferred less water in a little smaller glass. The food came out relatively quickly for a Saturday evening.  All of our dinners were good.  I had the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry.  The portion size was just right.  Not too much and not too little. I would eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
6,Lily A.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",74,3,,1.0,2016-10-11,I couldn't finish the burger I ordered. It came with nothing but a patty and cheese. It was so greasy that I had to wipe off the bottom bun because it was so soggy. Very disappointed and will not be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
3,Matthew C.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,250,69.0,4.0,2017-06-17,"When in town to grab groceries and essentials, we tend to make a night of it, whether it be a night to a bar, movie, or just dinner. There are tons of options for places to eat and drink, however this is staple and somewhat consistent... the happiness of your server maybe the only thing inconsistent.      Since they're franchise they also keep steady hours and the menu is the same. I would recommend eating here if you can decide where to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,

2,john j.,"Martinez, CA",1,48,1.0,1.0,2017-11-13,Frickn sloooooow! I won't be back.  Find somewhere else to spend your money. Place was pretty empty. Crappy steak and over cooked veggies.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
1,CC M.,"Gallatin Gateway, MT",0,13,26.0,1.0,2018-01-11,"Been going here for over 15years but no more! One of the reasons besides better seating we go early is for the happy hour as there's no way those drinks are worth $7 any other time. As usual I ordered my Long Island and as per the last several times it was weak and tasted like flat soda. Asked for a new one as per the last several times the second one is just fine. Nope, still bad but realized that was as good as it was gonna get. Bill came and I was charged full price. It was ordered at a few minutes after 5, happy hour is 3-6 (it's actually still happy hour as I type this!). I asked my server, Sammy who had been excellent up to that moment. Nope she said, 9 o'clock. Nope I saw yet again on the way out the board saying 3-6. But who cared? No one.  The burger is always a hit or miss. This one needed a funeral as it was so overcooked. Thank goodness I had asked for pink vs no pink. I can't imagine how dry it would have been had I asked well, yikes! The lettuce and onion had definitely been out under a heat lamp all day if not leftover from days ago. All dry, limp and gross. The pickles were all shriveled as well. This is not that expensive to have fresh, I used to be in food service management. Just no sense of care for the customer anymore. They should be replaced by something, anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bozeman-3,,,,,
