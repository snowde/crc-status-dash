20,Arnie K.,"Pflugerville, TX",25,188,1.0,3.0,2012-06-22,It was fine- good service and food was good for a road trip we were on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3?start=20,,,,,
17,Paul P.,"College Station, TX",1,7,,4.0,2012-12-15,"Service was great, food was good, probably order something different next time. Drinks got refilled before I was out and the waitress was just overall awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
16,Tina A.,"Austin, TX",14,15,4.0,1.0,2014-03-08,"Every time I eat here the food tastes ok. But about 2 hours later I'm sick as a dog. This never happens anywhere except here. Plus beware of your vegetables having the plastic in them since they are prepackaged. Or better yet, have the server not notice that your vegetables are still in the plastic that they zapped them in the microwave in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
12,Richard C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,17,,1.0,2014-06-27,"Offensive ""ambience"", Slow service, very mediocre food.   Stopped in here for lunch with two co-workers.  The place was 75% empty at 12:30 pm.  Although I wondered why, I soon found out.   Music blaring so loud I could not hear my party talking, nor myself.  I asked the waiter to please turn it down.  He agreed and came back and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, the manager is not here, but I've been told that it has to be loud because they need loud music for 'ambience'.    Really?, with ""ambience"" causing the place to be 80% empty on a weekday, right in the middle of lunch?  Also, one server with extremely slow service, food that was sloppy with greasy bread, soaked in oil on my sandwich. For a place with virtually no business you would think the owner/manager would have a clue.  No - he has a huge amount of hubris, thinking he knows best.   So, it's best for all to stay away.  Enter to have a miserable, painful to your ears and stomach, time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
13,Leanne M.,"Somerville, TX",2,9,,1.0,2014-09-29,My husband brought me here for lunch on our first date.  The food sucked and the service was horrible.  We haven't been back since but are quite appreciative of a funny first date memory.  Lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
14,K S.,"Katy, TX",2,56,7.0,1.0,2015-07-04,"There are signs everywhere explaining that they are open till 2am. Unfortunately, they misunderstood the concept. On a Friday night, they stop selling alcohol at midnight. Don't  ask me why, but that, along with the staff that didn't seem to care whether they received my business or not caused me to just leave. What a joke of an establishment. The bartender, who looked about 16, had no plans of staying or being of service, even though they weren't supposed to close for another hour and a half. If you want a beer and a burger after driving for hours, go to a gas station and whataburger or jack in the box. You'll save money and you won't be contributing to keeping garbage, terribly staffed chain restaurants like this open anymore. Make them earn your business, not expect it with a ""we built it so they'll come"" mentality. What a joke. If I were the proprietor with my name on the plaque out front, I'd be ashamed and have it removed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
10,Michael W.,"Smyrna, GA",2,39,2.0,1.0,2015-08-18,"So I can see why this place averages 2 stars.  Stopped out of convenience. Service was decently quick, but I order the low cal salmon with a plain baked potato - and the server was amazed I didn't want anything on it.  Sure enough it came out with at least a quarter stick of butter on it and melted into everything else on the plate.  Won't be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
9,Billy L.,"Houston, TX",5,21,2.0,4.0,2015-09-29,"Service is generally quite stellar. Food is usually fast and the food is unique to Brenham. Aside from chilies down the road your hard pressed to find some of the food choices. Is it great, no, but that's not this locations fault, it's apple bees in general. One of the male managers closes shop early if he feels like it, but I've always had a pretty good experience overall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
11,Jennifer B.,"New Ulm, TX",1,10,,1.0,2016-06-02,"I can't believe this place is still in business.  We have given this place a chance twice now and both times the service and the food was absolutely horrible.  The table next to us didn't even get their appetizers until after their food had already come, and they paid and got up and left.  I would not recommend this place at all!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
8,Andi D.,"Brenham, TX",0,3,,2.0,2016-10-23,Watch out for the circus freak bartender chick with all the tattoos and piercings in her face..Emily.  She's snarly and lazy but she loves to eavesdrop on her customers convos and share what she's overheard on social media. Sticking your nose in your customers business is bad for business. Cheap drink specials and decent food though. For 8 yrs I've always enjoyed myself here ..until this snake showed up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
7,Mike G.,"Brenham, TX",0,2,1.0,4.0,2016-11-23,"We frequently dine at Applebee's and rarely have been disappointed in the service, selection or quality of food.  You can't beat the 2 for $20 deal.  For some unknown reason this restaurant gets a bad wrap but for locals it's always crowded!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
2,Lauren F.,"Round Rock, TX",91,244,169.0,3.0,2016-11-25,"They were open Thanksgiving which was a plus. The service was excellent, the food looked good but was kind of bland. My dad got the Thanksgiving plate and both parents agreed that the turkey tasted like it had come out of a can. Everything else maybe needed some seasoning. I ordered the grilled vegetables, they too were incredibly bland and was just a 1/4th of a peice of a zucchini and a 1/4th of a peice of a squash. That was all they gave me. The garlic mash potatoes were really good however! So let's just say that they're vegetarian selection was severely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
4,Andrew D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,8,,1.0,2016-12-16,"If I could give negative stars or at least a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick to the manager I met tonight I would. Here's why I say that: I arrived at this restaurant this eventing around 10:50pm on my way to Houston for meetings I have tomorrow morning. I ordered a beer (which I received about 5-8min later...no biggie) and the fiesta chicken meal with rice. Everything was fine for the first 15min-20min or so, but that's when it all went downhill.  The bartender asked me at 12:10am ""Are you going to chug that or what?"" (as I have probably 3/4 of my beer left from a tallboy) I replied, ""No, why?"" to which she said ""Because I have to take it back in 5min."" Never in my life have I ever had a bartender take a drink back unless the place was closing, and this place is open until 2am. Also, from a responsible standpoint, no bartender should be having customers chug drinks like that as the night gets later. It creates a liability for them and the restaurant and is not having the customers best interest in mind. Very strange behavior.  As I sat there for the next 5min drinking my beer (decided not to chug), the bartender comes over and says she has to take it now as I replied, ""Ok, and do you know how much longer my food will be?"" She then left to go check. As she came back she was accompanied by some sloppy looking guy with a pedophile goatee (you know the type) who I had seen earlier from across the bar trying to hit on a table of ladies ever since I got there who said he didn't know that an order had been placed and he would go cook up the food. Come to find out this is the MANAGER. Yes, flirty/pedo goatee/sloppy looking guy = manager. Also, remember this is a good 25min after I arrived and ordered my food and had been my beer served/taken back. I'm no restaurant genius, but this restaurant has a lot of issues and I would bet they all stem from this guy.  After another 10-15min goes by the bartender finally brings out the food. Man oh man do I wish I would've taken a picture of the garbage they presented me. As I began to inspect the food the rice had a big dark glob of something in it and at that same moment the sloppy manager/flirty squirty comes out and asks how the food was. I replied as I picked up the rice glob with my fork, ""What is this?"" the manager replied...""That's a good question, I'll go check"" and headed to the back. I'm now sitting there wondering to myself first off what is in my food, and second how and the heck the manager just said that and left.  After a couple minutes goes by, slophead McGee comes back and this is where I've had enough.  The following is how the conversation went from here on: Me-""Come on man, you've got to be more professional than this. Your shirt is untucked, you're serving me rice with nasty globs of whatever in it, and I'm not even going to touch the chicken.""  Manager Slophead-""I was just coming back out to tell you I was going to remake the rice"" Me-""Why was it served to me in the first place if it looks like this? You all should be looking at the food you send out. You're the manager here and you should lead by example and this is not a good reflection of the quality of this place if this is the type of crap you serve. And while your at it, tuck your shirt in and be presentable"" Manager Slophead-""I've been cooking since 11 and my shirt comes untucked when I cook"" Me-""Are you kidding me? Seriously dude? You've got to be the most unprofessional manager I've ever seen. You waited 25min to even start cooking my food because you were trying to hit on some girls at that table over there. You need to find a new job."" Manager Slophead-""No one else complained about anything tonight"" Me-""No one complained tonight? What about other nights? Dude, you're a chump. You and this place are seriously a joke."" I probably spent more time than I should writing this, but honestly whoever the manager was tonight, I first off hope you take a shower because you looked like you needed to. Second, I hope someone teaches you how to tuck your shirt in. Third, the girls you were trying to hit on were on a scale of 1 to 10...a negative 3. Fourth, I hope your boss sees this and finds a solution for you being so unprofessional because dude you're worse than the 7 plagues of Egypt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
6,Ricky N.,"Houston, TX",2,3,,1.0,2017-04-07,"Horrible service. Never acknowledged me when I walked over to the bar to pick up my order. Attended to several parties who arrived after me. After one of those customers told the bartender I was there first, I was acknowledged. My order never came out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
1,Mister D.,"San Antonio, TX",51,479,137.0,3.0,2017-08-26,"We were passing thru and stopped here for lunch.  I had the [New] Whiskey Bacon Burger and thought it was okay.  It's advertised as being spicy, but I didn't really taste anything too spicy.  It came with fries, which were about what you'd expect for a chain restaurant -- nothing too special or memorable. Service was prompt and courteous and our waitress did an excellent job of tending to the table and staying on top of refills, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
5,Matthew H.,"Westside, Houston, TX",24,4,,4.0,2017-08-29,"We evacuated from Houston to Brenham. They were not fully staffed because of Hurricane Harvey. The service was polite, the beer was cold and the food was better than I recall for Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
0,Tom H.,"Katy, TX",0,11,1.0,4.0,2017-10-01,"We were heading back to Houston from Austin and wanted a bite to eat. We are familiar with the food at Applebee's and noticed that there was not too many folks in the parking lot. Well as we walked in it took a bit of time for a waitress to seat us but we didn't think too much about it. Well one waitress sat us down as we waited even longer for another to get a drink order.  (This was similar to another Applebee in Stafford Tx. where we waited at least thirty minutes for someone to get our drink order and they never came...so we walked out.) But after a while the manager came out to get our order and stated that they we short handed but not once did it seem to phase her. She was very polite and courteous. Even being short handed this manager flew around that restaurant and served as many customers as she and a couple of waitresses could handle. Not only did she do a great job she also convinced me to get the Two for $20 to save me at least $7.00 on my bill. Great service and great lady. Only drawback was the fact that they were understaffed, but we could relate because my wife and I have both been in the food service industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
3,Chelsea T.,"Glidden, TX",0,5,,2.0,2017-10-04,"The whole experience was just weird. The reason for 2 stars is that our actual entrees were tasty. The chips and artichoke dip was less than desirable. The chips were stale and chewy. Our service was not great, we saw a server maybe 3 times, someone else brought our meals and checked on us once. She did give us a ""fresh"" basket of chips which were slightly better. Our waters were never refilled even after asking for more water. She was friendly, but did not pay attention to details. If you're thinking about the mini-burger for the kid's meal, get two. They are REALLY ""mini"" (and pricy).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brenham-3,,,,,
