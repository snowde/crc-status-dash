15,Rebecca H.,"Evans, CO",26,52,,2.0,2012-05-18,"Yuck, I don't know why I am even wasting my time reviewing Applebees?!?  The restaurant is not very clean, the service sucked and the food--meh is an understatement for the poor quality.  I hate chains!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
12,Emma C.,"Denver, CO",30,135,21.0,4.0,2013-10-08,"The decor was lovely (they must have remodeled), and the food was hot, fresh, out quickly, and tasted great. I don't see why there's so many negative reviews. Yes, it's a chain, but this seems to be a really nice Applebee's in a great location. It's definitely better than any other Applebee's I've ever been to. My only complaint was our waitress seemed a little on the grumpy side, but hey, we're all human. My bacon burger was awesome, as were the onion rings, so I can't complain. I left there a happy camper! Also, BEWARE OF THE PARKING LOT. Very tight, lots of crazy drivers who come barreling around corners without looking, and lots of pedestrians walking around. It's probably worth it to park in the next-door King Sooper's lot and walk a short ways to the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
17,Christine F.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,2014-04-22,I left my phone on table and went back shortly thereafter to retrieve it.  The table had been cleaned and to my surprise the Manager and busser had not seen or had any idea of its location.  My comment is obviously the staff at this particular location in Brighton are deceitful and outright thieves.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
11,Matthew T.,"Brighton, CO",0,5,1.0,3.0,2014-09-19,I have not had bad service or food here.  The staff has been friendly on all my visits here.  It is Applebee's and you will get what you expect.   I love that they honor our veterans on veterans day.  It is a clean family friendly place to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
0,Michael D.,"Coal Center, PA",16,5,9.0,4.0,2014-10-27,"Great people and good food.  I've always been welcome when coning here,  and have had the staff recommend food for me to try.  I travel frequently and enjoy the consistency between locations.  The burgers are great here,  getting creative with how the stuff them.  Just wish that they served the Apple Chili Cheesecake.   This location doesn't!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
10,Lauren A.,"Waukesha, WI",2,15,,1.0,2015-08-26,"I'm sorry but we just ordered food at 9 pm for takeout on a Wednesday.. Breadstick hard and cold, with the Mac n cheese that literally had no cheese sauce at all.... Mostly dry noodles with some chicks on it. Maybe my bad for ordering this food to go and not eating in-house but this is a sad day for Mac n cheese....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
14,Kris J.,"Brighton, CO",0,16,,2.0,2016-01-04,entrée 14.49 does not include salad . Get a couple small pieces of meat and some mashed potatoes .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
9,Hannah J.,"Brighton, CO",0,56,,1.0,2016-05-04,"Always takes forever to get my food, even if I just order something simple. Rude staff interrupting my conversations all the time asking if I'm ready for the bill before I've even finished my entrée.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
4,Kenneth E.,"Commerce City, CO",0,3,1.0,1.0,2016-07-22,"Just came back from having dinner at this location. Worst location I've been too. The place was in need of a cleaning. Now I know it was rush hour dinner service, but vacuuming the floor takes no effort or time consuming at all. Okay, for the main course. My Father-in-law ordered a well done steak w/ grilled veggies. Before our order came out, we could hear the table behind us. It seemed they ordered steak as well and it took three times for the chef to get it right. Our food came out and the server asked us to check our steaks. My wife's steak was good but my Father-in-law's steak was rare. They took it back to re-fire and when it was returned, it was still pink. I ordered a burger. I do not like ketchup and was not aware this came with it. Nothing in the description indicated ketchup was included. My wife ordered the mashed sweet potatoes, and they had the consistency of soup.  Last, the place was freezing. 2-3 bites in and your food was cold.  Me nor my family will be returning to this location. Side note: I asked why there are so many returned steaks. I was told the chef is training on the fire grill. Training. On a Friday night. Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
8,BigDaddy H.,"Brighton, CO",24,6,,1.0,2016-10-07,"I've always had good service here at Applebee's in Brighton, good food, great atmosphere, you know its Applebee's. Tonite I took my wife there for dinner, and I ordered one of those 12oz wood fire grilled steaks, (medium) and it came out like a piece of rubber. My wife ordered the grilled chicken and her meal came our freezing cold, and my meal was luke warmth say the least. I don't know if management there cares, but your place has gone down hill each time we go there. Probably will not return even if it is convenient and easy. As a matter of fact we will not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
6,Brandy B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,8,2.0,1.0,2016-12-28,Booths are horrible it was even tight for my 8 year old to sit in one and he is a regular size 8 for an 8 year old. The mac and cheese has no flavor and what little bit of sauce is on it is runny.  The service not so great either.  Find another spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
7,Arturo M.,"Brighton, CO",0,17,2.0,3.0,2017-02-03,"My friends and I went here last night to eat after the movie, there was not many options so we choose here. We got there and they did greet us and sat us down right away, once at the table our waiter Austin which he was (great) by the way came and got out drinks and waters going. After we order the food and we went through like a drink and a half til the food comes out. Which i thought it was a long time for it being late at night, the food though was good no complains on that some of the alcohol drinks were a little on the strong side but ok. When it came down to us leaving and paying our tab he was more busy in cleaning everything else and then coming to us. I can say will be back but maybe not as often as before and also they can work a bit a their staff checking up a little more on tables and keeping clean in between rushes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
2,Ryan S.,"Brighton, CO",6,32,57.0,5.0,2017-02-07,Always good food. Always great service. Half-priced select apps during happy hour keeps bringing me back. Can't get enough boneless wings & mozzarella sticks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
5,Wallace C.,"Brighton, CO",0,3,,4.0,2017-03-29,We come here often! Service and food very consistent. They've made some great changes to the menu. The Firecracker Shrimp Tappiti has a sneaky heat that's fantastic! Definitely coming back for that!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
3,Tony L.,"Commerce City, CO",17,9,1.0,2.0,2017-07-20,"Food was just ok. Can't expect much from applebees I guess. Meat undercooked, asked for medium and got rare. Took awhile for the server to finally get us our drinks, we already knew what we wanted to order by the time he came to take the drink order. It just wasn't a 'wanting to return' experience. Would give 2 1/2 stars if I could. Didn't even want to wait around for dessert",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
1,Charles A.,"Brighton, CO",0,37,,1.0,2017-12-20,"My Wife and I decided on Applebee's after an evening of Christmas shopping. Went inside and the young lady at the door welcomed us with a smile. We asked for a booth and she told us that the ""booth was being cleaned and would be ready in just a minute"". Fine. After the hostess cleaned the booth, she wiped the table and seats down with a wet towel (leaving water everywhere). She apologized and got several napkins to wipe up the water. The ""waiter"" (and I use the term VERY loosely) took our drink orders (diet Coke and water) and came back with the drinks. He asked us if we needed time to review the menu and we told him ""Yes, give us a minute or two"". 10 minutes later, we noticed the ""waiter"" laughing up with (apparently) friends who were seated at the bar. He looked at us and walked to the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back from the kitchen, looked at us - Our menus had been down on the table for now 12 minutes - and began laughing with his bar buddies again. At this point we walked out. We ended up at the 3 Margaritas across the parking lot where we had a wonderful meal. If your customer service is routinely this bad - it's little wonder why the reviews reflect it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brighton-5,,,,,
