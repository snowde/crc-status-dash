44,Vern W.,"New York, NY",20,52,12.0,3.0,2012-05-09,The food is standard Applebee's fare.  Which is a plus.  Lots of options except maybe for vegetarians (but I suspect a vegetarian would not go to Applebees or it's ilk) Service varies. I have gotten speedy service on some days and others it has been very slow.  The thing that makes up for it is that the staff is generally very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=60,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

27,Sammy S.,"Bronx, NY",6,54,,2.0,2013-03-23,"So, I went here recently and had a pretty poor experience.  I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Alfredo.  When I got my food, it tasted off.  It was bland.  I asked for extra parmesan cheese on the side.  They brought me mozzarella, which is a very mild cheese.  When I informed the waitress that she brought me cheese that I didn't want, her response was that they were out of parmesan.  Seriously??? Parmesan is a flavorful cheese.  That is probably why my meal tasted off.  You can't make  Alfred without parmesan.  I was really annoyed that the kitchen was making poor substitutions with the food.  Overall, I say go to a better run Applebee's.  I've had other problems with the Applebee's to go service too at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=60,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002
5,Bella L.,"Methuen, MA",72,182,183.0,5.0,2013-03-28,"My favorite Applebee's location. Employees make you feel so welcomed and valued and it seems the Chef takes a little extra time in preparing your food just right. The service is great and the food is delicious. I've visited a few other Applebee's but this one is my favorite. I did have a negative encounter once but just like they say to turn a frown upside, that is exactly what the manager did. She fixed that issue right up! so I do not stress that one time. My favorite is the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, favorite drink is the Sangria and I try to fit in the Triple Chocolate Melt if I am not that full. It is so good and they let you know, it's real Haagen Daz ice cream served with it. The bar is also cool here, especially sports nights. Those sport fans turn into comedians.

As soon as we sat down the employee grabbed menu's and said follow me. She then sat us but it is very close the front entrance . We had a carrage and a small rolling bag.  It was 3:05 pm other customers that came after us were getting served before us time we got some new tricks to take our order it was 330 and by the time we got our food it was 4 p.m. I was finished by 4:05 because my burger was so light that it took me 5 minutes to eat my wife finished at 4:20. The waitress gave me the bill at 4:53 I waited for her to come back to collect the money but she never came back so I left the money on the table and I told the employees at the door as I did not see the waitress and she says I'm sorry and that was the end of my parients Applebee's If I didn't pay the bill they probably wouldn't never notice anyway. Terrible service at all points. This place needs a manager. The hostess that greeted us was pretty rude and condescending.  And the waitress was really nice but she disappeared 15 ~ 20 minutes at a time never showed up to any of the tables.

It can take upwards of ten minutes to be seated, just like the theme park attraction, as the hostess blatantly ignores you or disappears into the proverbial Twilight Zone. The ride only gets worse, though, as the wait staff regularly disregards your table for long stretches of time, forgets to refill your drink, gets your order wrong, or take far too long to give you your check.

The drinks are very watered down and take long to be delivered to your table.  They run out of certain appetizers during the peak time and wait to tell you after they bring you your other items.  Waiters do not come directly to you at times unless you stand up and grab their attention.  It is in a great location so its sad that service sucks and food is not that great.  Like others noted sometimes the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave.

I went here with my wife on Monday January 4th, 2015 during the day time and the place was practically empty - you would think that we are about to get exceptionally fast service..... NOT!!!  First things first the music that plays in the background was super loud - Headache Loud to be honest, who wants to hear super loud music while they eat in the middle of the day? Anyway we tried to put that to the side but after sitting there for 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us my wife decided to bring it to the attention of the manager. It's not like the server did not see us sitting there  she only came to the table next to us 5 times and looked dead at us.... wtf is that? Once the manager reamed her out which was very obvious as he did it on the floor where everyone could see, she strolled over to tell us her name and that she would be serving us.... Like really we already know that bozo!!! At this point were 30 minutes into our visit, she finally takes our orders - we started with an order of mozzarella sticks for 2 followed by an order of riblets for my wife and a steak meal for myself.  DISAPPOINTED just isn't the word I would like to use at this point - we waited an addition 45 minutes for this food and it SUCKED as well. The riblets looked like a steak as they were 1 solid piece and her fries were overdone, my steak was bland and under cooked ( I asked for well done) my baked potato was hard like a rock and by the way - the mozzarella sticks had the flavor of frozen to them accompanied by a miserable tomato sauce. Dessert (chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream) was about the only tasty thing we had but even that left a sour taste as we had to wait 25 more minutes just for that. - that's over1 1/2 hours to have a complete meal at a non crowded Applebee's.

When she'd ordered this at other locations, little pieces of pickles, onions, and bacon were in the burger - and nothing was in this one.   We had to flag down 3 different servers before our waitress came over (which took about 20 minutes).  This is probably the longest I've had to wait at a restaurant.  When we explained the issue, the waitress argued with us for a bit.  My friend hoped to get the actual burger she ordered, but service had taken so long that we didn't have time.  Ultimately the waitress took the burger off of the bill, but only after much discussion.

Awful food, their steaks are like the soles of my shoes without the holes. Timing impeccable, if you want to wait 2 hours for a steak. Their margaritas alcohol free.

50,Daybel V.,"West Bronx, NY",120,14,2.0,1.0,2017-09-21,I came here with my husband to grab lunch on 9/21 @ 2:00 pm. We went to the bar because we had an appointment around the corner. It's not even the bartenders fault. She was working alone. The bar was completely filled. She had to go and get the to go orders herself. The bar area was filled with about 26 dirty cups. Garbage on the floor. Boxes of product on the counter. There were ppl waiting to pay for their orders. She had to also grab her own food. Where's the management making sure they are providing Great customer service ? That's how employees get overwhelmed and begin hating their jobs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
48,Jerrius J.,"Bronx, North Hempstead, NY",142,93,122.0,3.0,2017-10-29,"Went on a Monday night during a Yankee game. The place was fairly busy and although i was only one person, probably took me about 10 minutes to get seated.  The burgers/fries are only 8.99$ on Monday nights and draft beer like Stella is only 5$ so it was a good deal. I got the quesadilla burger and I think I regret it. It was a fine burger: the salsa tasted fresh but if I am going to go out of my way to eat red meat, this would not my choice. The fries were fine but literally my favorite thing about Applebees is that if you ask for a side of BBQ, they bring you hot (like temperature wise) BBQ and in my humble opinion, everything tastes 2X as good with hot BBQ.   I will go back and get a different burger probably but satisfied for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
46,Don L.,"Franklin, MA",28,140,97.0,3.0,2017-11-01,"This is a good sized Applebees.  Located right outside the gates of Fordham University.  The menu is standard Applebees.  The prices are are a pretty good deal. The food is OK and predictable.  We had several varieties of burgers.  it is interesting that they don't ask how you like them, and they come out fairly well done.  We did like the fries. Our server was efficient.  They have the touch screens to play pay with, which I personally hate, but obviously some people like it. There is a lot of dining options in the area, I would not put this near the top of the list. It is OK, just not particularly special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

55,Drew K.,"Bronx, NY",0,10,10.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"This Applebee's COMPLETELY SUCKS...we went here tonight and it took 10 minutes for our starting drinks to come out. Drinks were all ice and weak. Entrees look NOTHING like advertised on menu. Had spinach dip appetizer and sauce was some microwaved crap. Just no love or care put into preparing food. Our server, Amanda was nice, but manager was an ass...gave us a lot of lip service for the tiny, unsatisfactory second round of drinks, and instead of just giving them to us on house, he took them. Hope he didn't give them to someone else bcuz I sipped on it and have a cold. And if he poured them out, then that just goes to show the extra mile he'd be willing to go to make customers happy. This place is just terrible on so many levels....this is just a few. Outside the restaurant heard other patrons with exact same complaints....I will NEVER EVER go to this location again....in fact, I won't bother with any Applebee's period. Quality of food is just not good and for a few extra dollars, can get better quality, better prepared food somewhere else. I'd suggest people reexamine their palette if you think this quality eating (no offense to those reading this, but I'm being serious).

Poor me waitress didn't know the menu after recommending a dish. Then every beer had to be returned cause of a hot tap SMH and after all the returns of dishes and drinks NOT ONE of the 2 mangers came to see what the problem was or try to make us feel better about the continuous fuck ups SMH I don't think I will return to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
