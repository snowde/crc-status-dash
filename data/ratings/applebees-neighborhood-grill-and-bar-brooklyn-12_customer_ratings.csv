102,Philip B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,20,,1.0,2012-02-08,"Went to Crapplebees, ordered a ""frajita"" dish and distinctively told the server {Russian}""no mushrooms"" cuz I`m allergic to them. 40  minutes later when it finally came, it was cold and LOADED  with `shrooms. I sent it back and waited another 10 minutes. When the servre put it on the table, she said very rudely ""are you satisfied now""? Ate it and left. Bland and tasteless, the chicken was  tough and overcooked, and the peppers and onions were practically raw Gave her a very small tip- and I generally tip very good. . A total bummer, one of the worst ""dining"" experiences I`ve ever had. I intend to complain about it on their website. Avoid this  place like the plague.

138,Joe P.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",23,20,2.0,1.0,2012-05-18,"This is the worst place I have ever eaten at.  I see people giving good reviews and I have to say that they should have their Yelp rights revoked.  I know better than to eat at a chain restaurant but I figured how could they screw up a burger? First, I ordered a side Caesar salad and when I received it, it tasted refrigerated and the croutons were stale.  I then ordered one of their ""signature"" burgers. I asked for it to be cooked medium rare.  I was told that they can't make it this way.  Im still trying to understand why.  I specifically asked that it not be well done.  Sure enough it was well done and the bacon was undercooked...better yet it was cold.  The burger itself was cold and I asked to return it for what I ordered.  So believe it or not, they brought me another well done burger.    With all that said, when I took one bite of the salad and pushed it away the bartender didn't even ask what was wrong with it.  Likewise with the burger, all they asked was if I was finished. In conclusion, the kitchen staff is terrible, the service is completely oblivious and doesn't seem to know how to service their clientele. The best part of the entire place was the valerie guys who got me in and out of there fast.   Sad that I have to actually give it one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=100,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.084,2.28

Our waiter was friendly and was constantly recommending us appetizers and etc. The portions were fairly big or maybe it was just my dish. I ordered the blackened steak penne which was amazing!  Highly recommended if you were to come to this Applebee's! Con: The bathroom was extremely dirty and the hand soap smelled disgusting! And I asked for a medium steak. My steak came out well-done. Was super dry!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=80,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.38,2.36
31,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",752,1201,281.0,1.0,2012-07-08,"This was by far the worst Applebee's I have ever visited and I am shocked that it is still in business.  I should've read the reviews prior to coming here because that would've saved me a lot of trouble.   They offer painfully slow service.  We sat outdoors and there were 2 other tables seated there (although one was leaving).  It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us after we had been seated and then an additional 45 minutes for the server to begin bringing the food out.  If they were busy and I was at a high-end restaurant, I can understand it taking a long time for my food to be prepared.  At Applebee's, these foods are mostly deep-fried, thrown on a plate and then served ... it also didn't help that on my way to the bathroom, I passed a table of at least 10 servers just yapping it up about some DUI one of them recently got.  Our particular server was also careless and gave us the wrong information, first telling us that we wouldn't be charged for something and then later telling us that it would be an additional $8 charge.  We were very thankful to leave as soon as we finished our meal, which also tasted really bland and dry (chicken and potatoes).

The menu is average for a family style chain restaurant. The prices are good since there is usually some sort of special going on. It's nice that you can sit outside and get a breeze from the water, but the wait to be seated when there are empty tables available is ridiculous.

My mom's chicken was too spicy, but the shrimp and mushrooms were ok.  Her bro had a steak w/shrimp which was ok as I tasted it.   But wait, where is the soups?  oh waitress... she comes over and  says the 1st waitress was supposed to pass it on.  But, after 10mins  the soup comes. I guess the best part was drinking Ginger Ale to wash all that junk down the pipes.   Oh, and so when I was in the can, a young man was real sick in there.   No more Applebee's for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=100,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.18,2.12

My friends plate came out somewhat sizzling as it should and mine came quiet and warm. I was very disappointed.

91,Emma N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,2,,1.0,2012-11-21,"This place doesn't even deserve a star. First let me say the only reason me and my friend came to Applebees was because Friday's was closed due to sandy. We were seated pretty quick. I asked to go to the bathroom and had to walk through a maze like environment. It's so inconvenient. The tables are so close together and the bathroom seemed like a mission to get too. I'm surprised the stalls had toilet paper. There were no towels to wipe my hands with. I went to go sit at the bar and the stools were uncomfortable to sit on because they were wobbling. When we ordered our food we didn't wait long. When the food was brought out the waiter TWICE switched our order so whatever I ordered was given to my friend and vice verse. My friend ordered potato twists and instead he got plain chips with cheese. Who wrote this menu ? It was literally chips and cheese. My wings were good. The drinks weren't as strong. The waiters seemed inattentive and boring. When I commented on how i liked the waiters shirt because it said ""Hello Brooklyn"" on it instead of replying oh thanks! he said ""it's our uniform...""

The service was good, we had to wait a little bit for a table which was fine. The reason for the 2 star review, both me and him did not feel well after we ate.

The wings were decent. It wasn't hot. There was three skinny sticks of celery on the side that was a bit warm when we got them. I ordered my steak medium well and that's how I got it.

The bartenders at the bar are rude and are not friendly unless your buying a drink or having dinner at the bar. Since we were waiting for a table they outright rolled their eyes at us. The hostess told us twenty minutes, and when twenty minutes came I asked a bout how much longer and she almost told me twenty minutes again. Smh I reminded her of how long we were there and she then said 15 minutes. We continue to stand and wait in the very crowded and packed entrance as we are shooed from the bar, the entrance and everywhere. Meanwhile as someone slept on the couches used for the people waiting. As we are waiting lots of people were leaving yet no ones names are being called. 4 tables that could've sat at least 2 per table just remained with rejected food, dirty dinnerware and no sign of anyone emptying and cleaning to let others sit. From the time we began waiting to the time we were finally seated.

I got a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger which was cooked properly (medium well), juicy and tender with a good amount of bacon, tomatoes and lettuce. Fries were okay but not to die for. My friend ordered an Oriental Chicken Salad which she HATED. Personally I didn't see anything wrong with it but she claims the flavor was all over the place and the chicken itself was dry. She had one bite and decided not to finish. Therefore we ended up sharing my burger and fries.

Now having been here plenty of times before we were figuring between the two of us that would be plenty of food with some left over. Wow were we wrong.

So we waited till the waitress came back with the rest of the food and asked her if those were actually the 2 for $11.99 and the full size apps and she said ""Yes, the appetizers are smaller now.""

I didn't taste the burgers from the kiddie menu, but they looked gross and the boys hardly touched them. The best entree they have ate the ribs.

So as we seated we were given our ""books"" and I say books because there were multiple menus and insert and in general it was way too crowded to look at everything all at once, that takes a point away. Simply put it, you can't have an over complicated menu, while it wasn't complicated it was just all over the place especially when you have a few members in your party, Applebee's go fix that! I already finished school I'm not trying to go back just to read everything on there and figure the puzzle of which page or book belongs to which. Thanks.  Now as you finally figure out what you want to eat, you'll come across the awesome chicken poppers, knockers however they may call them, they are hot buffalo wings with the choice to get extra hot so you can burn the flavor right off your tongue. Luckily I saved myself the trouble and went with Mild. Next time... I then ordered the ribs with fries and holy Pigsus (Pig + jesus = no? Okay). These were damn good extremely tender and I love bbq sauce so they had a tangy flover along with a smoke cooked taste to them, they fell right off the bone, I ordered a full rack because I figured it was worth the money.

Twenty minutes later the bartender told me they're packing my food up. Ten minutes later the manager came out to tell me they don't have what I ordered and he apologizes for having me wait 30 minutes. He tells me he'll pay for my dish and will make me anything else I want. He then tells me he'll have it out in four minutes. I ended up waiting another twenty minutes. Having spent almost an hour waiting no one even offered me water. The manager gave me a card for a free meal next time. My boyfriend and I went last night and I have never been more disgusted. The hostess didn't acknowledge us because she was too busy with her head down looking at her phone. I had to interrupt her from whatever else was so important. After we placed our order the appetizer came out great, but our two burgers took over 40 minutes. To make matters worse my side was wrong, and as I started to eat my burger several bites into it I couldn't eat anymore. The burger was Raw. They hadn't cooked it properly and I was completely disgusted. Thanks for making me sick! The restaurant and the team sucks.

Kudos to him for being attentive when it was so busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12,1.56,2.36,2.36,,2.04
113,Natali P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,2018-01-02,Terrible service. Took an hour for the waiter to bring the check. Food was awful as well. I felt like the meat was not fresh at all. The host was very mad at everyone too. I saw a family and a child walk in and it seemed like she was mad that they had a carriage.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12,1.56,2.34,2.34,,2.028
