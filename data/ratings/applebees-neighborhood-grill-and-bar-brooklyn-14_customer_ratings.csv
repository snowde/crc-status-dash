86,Elizabeth B.,"Brooklyn, NY",431,641,144.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"This is an Applebee's on the border of Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. Coming here is not like being magically transformed to someplace completely different. It is like being at an Applebee's where the staff and the customers are from Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. Tonight, the customers at the bar were having a really good time watching the basketball game and the bartenders were super nice and reasonably attentive. I've had a few notably dreadful experiences here, been treated like my decision to eat at a table at this restaurant is a statement somewhat less drastic than but in the vein of a sit-in at Woolworth's in 1960, but tonight the drinks were strong, the service was good-hearted and a fun time was had by all. Did I have a sticky menu? Well, yes. It's not the Palm. And the food is exactly like food at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=80,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005
79,Leonard P.,"Brooklyn, NY",177,189,310.0,1.0,2012-03-10,"Despite my horrible experience at the Applebee's located in the Atlantic Mall, and oath to never frequent the franchise again, in some quixotic, Groundhog Day-esque fugue, I wound up at another Applebee's. Though admittedly it was not my fault, someone I know in Bed-Stuy wanted me to work on their computer and wanted to eat someplace close first. The other person arrived first and had ordered appetizers. When I arrived 15 minutes later, the appetizers had not arrived. We ordered beers, which took 10 minutes to come - mind you, we were seated right near the bar. I could have brewed the beer faster. Our server gave the excuse that the bartender had to take time to prepare the drinks, How hard is it to pour a beer? The rest of the evening was a disaster: the food took forever to come, with only a lame apology by the manager, with no compensation given due to the problem. The quality of the food was marginal at best. My order for a second beer was never delivered. This restaurant is such an embarrassment to a neighborhood that is being revitalized and finally getting the unique variety of businesses that used to shun this area of Brooklyn. I am forced to at least give one star for my review - which this restaurant does not even earn that...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=60,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003
75,Yansa Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,1.0,2012-04-05,"Horrible service.  Horrible.  Like everyone else, I was seated haphazardly, left to wait interminally, and eventually left without ordering after complaining to a nearby waiter and having another come over - not to take my order - but to tell me that the person who was supposed to take my order was ""coming"".  Well that's nice, but since you clearly do the same job, is there any reasons you geniuses didn't think a better idea was to have YOU just take my order??? No?   :/ And I'm sorry - but I MUST comment on the obnoxious and presumptuous contribution of the reviewer below me.  In case you live under a rock and aren't aware - comments like this: It is like being at an Applebee's where the staff and the customers are from Crown Heights and Bed Stuy.  are extremely rude and stereotypical.  And please don't think that because you were attempting to be vague, that your point didn't come across loud and clear.   I'd venture a guess that you are rarely in bedstuy or crown heights, or recently moved there with all the rest of the new ""entitled"" neighbors I've been encountering more recently.  You don't belong in Bed Stuy.  You certainly don't belong there making judgments about the quality of service based on your personal perception of what the usual residents of the area are capable of in terms of providing a decent service.  There are many restaurants in Bed Stuy, run not by a corporation, but by individuals who actually live in, work in, and care about the community, that offer wonderful service and are made up of all the same ""staff and customers...from Bed Stuy and Crown Heights.""   So watch your mouth, Becky.  If you have criticisms of the neighborhood there's always Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights conveniently priced for people like you.  Bon Voyage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=60,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
76,Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,156,41.0,1.0,2012-04-18,"I tried going here one night - the door was locked 35 minutes before their actual closing time. Annoying. Finally ended up going. Service was horrendous. Instead of our waiter telling us all of the wines/liquers they had run out of, we waited about 10 minutes in between each drink, and each time he returned with another reason the bar couldn't make our drinks.  Also, he FORGOT someone's dinner. We ended up sharing our food with our friend because our waiter never put his meal in - and his response was ""Oh, I forgot."" We ended up getting a ""discount"" - but I think my friend would've rather had his food. Needless to say, I may come here for a beer at the bar during a game... but definitely not for food. Ever.

Mostly I eat in rarely  takeout.I ordered the Grilled Jalapeno-Lime Shrimp without the rice, red potatoes instead. The description says a generous portion. I peeked inside the bag but did not fully inspect  the food before leaving. I really felt the portion was very scanty, but I did not want to complain in front of a lot of people sitting around. I was very disappointed when l got home & put this childs portion on a small plate. Why put such a small portion in such a huge container. The meal was $16 & change. I gave a tip at the waiting area. I saw no rolls or breadsticks which were not  included. I purchased 4. I will not go back to this location. Downtown Brooklyn gives more for your money. The 1 star is a plus. I was still hungry I'm a person who does not eat a lot in a huge plate anymore. This meal was listed as spicy. I felt it was very bland & missing taste.

Stuart: k Me: Ok back Stuart: it was weird with keanu reeves there. like the waitress i feel was trying really hard to not recognize it was keanu reeves, to just to treat him like anyone else but the result was it was not at all natural, the way she was acting. Me: You can't act normal if you're trying to act normal. Me: That kind of stuff must happen to celebrities all the time. Stuart: i don't think most people noticed he was there though, like most people were just genuinely interested in their own applebees food or like, thought it was just a guy dining who look liked keanu Me: That's probably what I would think. Stuart: it was def keanu though. the only diners to notice him were these couple of teen boys who walked by and yelled, ""NEOOO! YOU ARE THE ONE!!"""" and he just kind of like grimly nodded at them.

I felt it was a good step in the direction of better neighborhood. My son graduation was Tuesday June 24th at 9 am. My family and I decided to have a celebratory lunch at this restaurant. Unfortunately this wasn't a good experience for us. Upon entering the building we were met with a foul smell when asked the hostess about it she stated it was chicken but I wouldn't smell it when I'm seated. The smell was so strong as if you were in a meat department. Never the less we continue to be seated due to the fact of pleasant experience I've always had. We were seated at 11:03 but we didn't have our complete party therefore we only ordered Appetizer and beverages. The rest of my party arrived at 11:33 then we proceeded to order our entrees. At 12:27 we still have not received our food. We expressed our concern to the waitress and she said it was coming. After about 10 minutes we asked for a manager. We also asked two other staff members for a manger as well the manger still didn't come out. When I stopped one of the workers his immediate response was your food was coming. At that present moment I felt uncomfortable to consume any food. After 10 minutes and several request for the manger she finally graced us with her presence. We explained the situation and she immediately said you didn't order as soon as you were seated. I answered that was correct but we did order at 11:30 am it is now 12:27 p.m. we should've had our food by now. Then she (Manager) said that the kitchen was backed up. Her whole attitude verbally and her body language was disturbing. She didn't show any type of professionalism at all and I thank God that I wasn't ignorant because it could've gotten very ugly. She wasn't apologetic at all and didn't show any concerned towards the situation. I did request for the food to be bagged up at this time it was 12:45 now. It took another 10 minutes for the food to come out. I did tell the waitress I didn't want the food but yet they bought any way.  The waitress and the manger bought the food out and when I told them we didn't want it the manger sucked her teeth and swung herself around. We had to wait another 10 minutes for the receipt. When we walked out my son notice that the manger gave me a nasty look I mean really. The manger needs to learn better customer service skills. I was disappointed, frustrated and hungry. What a bad way to end my son's graduation. This experience deters me from entering 1360 Fulton St. Applebees as long as she's a manager.

37,Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227.0,2.0,2015-01-31,"I love Applebee's, I love Long Island locations better because they have superior customer service skills, unlike Brooklyn locations. I came here a year ago and had the worse service ever so I decided to never return. My daughter turned 13 today so she asked if we could drop in and due to frigid temperatures and not having a babysitter, I agreed to come here to give them a second chance.  We were seated quickly, we ordered quickly and our server was ok. He wasn't great because he never checked on us for a refill or to see how we were doing. Now the prices here are jacked up sky high. I was literally in Applebee's 3 weeks ago, ordered the same stuff but paid more at this location $25 more at that.  Our food came out missing sauce for the quesadilla and missing sour cream. My daughters chicken tenders didn't come with a dipping sauce either but we were unbothered by that. We ate our food and they sang Happy Birthday to my daughter which was nice. They charged us $1 for the Birthday Sundae, all other Applebee's give it for free. Clearly this location has no hospitality for their Birthday guest but it's whatever.  As we finished our food, we were given the bill and we weren't finished. Just like any franchise or establishment we visit, we get our full course meal. We had not ordered dessert for my daughters and myself. I told our waiter who did apologize and ripped the bill up and took down our dessert orders and left. He came back 10 mins later with it and it was good. We finished and we were happy, the bill was very high compared to other locations but the service was better this time around. They also make up this menu on their own as they do sell ""Jerk chicken"" at this location only. I can only assume that their prices are jacked up by management and not the franchise in its location alone! Better than our first time here but I won't be coming here again due to the prices on their menu and the changes they have on the menu unlike other Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.8,2.4

I pass this Applebee's on the way to the grocery store, and recently jokingly suggested to my fiance that we eat here instead of cooking. He agreed. Alright, then.  We were seated in the bar area so that we could take advantage of the all night happy hour specials, which include discounted drinks and half off select appetizers.  He had a $4 Stella and I had a $4 glass of wine that tasted exactly like $4 wine.  We ended up doing the $27 special that came with 1 app and 2 entrees plus another app from the happy hour menu.  Appetizers: The spinach artichoke dip was great, but I've never had bad spinach artichoke dip.  The wonton chicken tacos were also super good. A little sweet from the teriyaki but the slaw on top was really nice.   Entrees: Butcher's Meat and Potatoes -- the meat was overcooked. Like, over over over cooked. The onion rings were extremely greasy. I did enjoy the mashed potatoes and the tomatoes, though.  Sirloin Stir Fry -- once again, the meat was so overcooked. No moisture left, hard to cut. Major disappointment. The rest of the dish tasted like a microwave meal that you settle for because you said you'd start bringing your lunch to work to save money but didn't feel like actually cooking.  The Service: This was actually probably the worst part of the meal. We never received water, it took over half an hour to order, and we received one of our apps after our entrees were half done.

9,Skyler L.,"Granada Hills, CA",54,11,6.0,1.0,2017-06-17,"I'm just going to go ahead and say it: every person working at this Applebee's needs to be fired. Don't even bother retraining the staff, start from scratch and rehire all of the positions. It might even be a better idea just to start a fire and let the building burn to the ground. Living in the neighborhood I've walked past this location multiple times, and I'll admit, every time I go by the place is always popping.  So when I finally went, naturally I assumed the popularity would make sense. Once we walked in, the woman at the front walked by multiple times but didn't seem to notice us or care. We stood waiting for five minutes to even be acknowledged. When we sat down, they didn't have any silverware rolled, and we were instead given silverware in a plastic glass of hot water. ??? I wouldn't even care about such shoddy innovation if everything else wasn't ALSO poor quality. I ordered the Caprese Mozzarella Burger because the photo online made it look very good. However, just as McDonald's flaunts photos of burgers that appear-not just at a standard that meets the term 'edible,' but 'good' dare I say... the food I was given was less than expected on multiple levels. My biggest issue with this is that everyone knows McDonald's advertises burgers but SERVES gray sludge painted to look like food, but with Applebee's? Really? This was by far the most flavorless burger I have ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm certain my napkin would have had a better flavor profile than what I was served. Ever heard of seasoning, Applebee's? For fuck's sake this is a black neighborhood and I'm left wondering who's white ass grandpa you've got chained to the grill back there working for pennies. On top of all of this, I asked for jalapeños to spice up what I expected to be a somewhat mild burger in terms of flavor due to the mild cheese they put on it. That last paragraph was just about the meat. Don't get it twisted, I knew what I was doing ordering a MOZZARELLA BURGER. I digress, the jalapeños took a long time to get to our table, which I asked for upon ordering, and we weren't updated about from our waiter... so I end up sitting there staring at this burger I had taken one bite out of that tasted like the flavorless liquid laxative you get from Walgreen's... watching it cool on my plate. Eventually the jalapeños arrived, RAW, which was disappointing since raw jalapeños also don't have much of a flavor profile as they are simply heat in your mouth, so way to go Applebee's. Then I ask for hot sauce and the only thing they have stocked is TOBASCO. Which, out of all the hot sauces out there, is the worst one. It should just be rebranded as a terrible vinegar. But at this point, I'm starving for both food, and any sort of flavor that my meal could provide. So naturally I drench the burger in tobasco and litter it with the raw jalapeños and start eating. At this point I'm starting to suffer a bit, the jalapeños being very spicy but adding nothing else of value to the meal, and it was too late to do anything other than cringe and recoil at my mistaken liberal use of that tobasco. So I'm downing my water, and where's the waiter to check on us? Probably down in the basement where this Applebee's forces their employees to do trivial laborious tasks during all down time. At least, that's my best assumption based on the vacant mental absence plastered on most of the employees faces. Eventually, I caught our waiter's attention, got more water, and then we had to catch him again later to get the check.  Lastly, the overall prices at Applebee's does not reflect the value you get in service, or food. This entire experience has left me shook. 1/5 would not recommend. But if you must go, I suggest wearing a ridiculous outfit so perhaps the staff will actually pay attention to you. Oh, and bring your own hot sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
38,Brandon Z.,"New York, NY",0,12,14.0,1.0,2017-06-23,"I'm not one to write bad reviews but the service at this Applebee's is horrendous. I walked in the restaurant and waited 20 mins in front for a hostess because no one was at the counter. After waiting 20 mins I got annoyed and asked a server where is the hostess. He said ""she's coming back just hold on a sec"". I continued to wait this is after 20 mins already went by. Then she comes and totally ignores the people waiting. She proceeded to answer the phone and turn her back towards us. The server makes her aware people are behind her where she asks for the name of the party. I tell her the name and she's just staring at me. I was waiting for a buzzer or something like ""please step aside sir we will call you up"". Instead I had to ask her um how do I know when my table is ready. She responded I'll call you when your party is ready. So I'm thinking hey I'm get a table in a few minutes because tables were being clean off and there was empty seating. Instead they had multiple parties wait for 10-20 mins for a table that never had anyone there since we entered the restaurant. At this point I was getting aggravated that there was seating available but they were not utilizing them. I'm not one of those people who think when I entered a restaurant everything needs to be catered to me but this was ridiculous. There was empty seating and no one was being seated. Instead we waited for a booth that was open since I arrived there. The server was okay. His service at first sucked because I told him we don't know what we want to eat yet and he walked away. So I stopped him and said I know what I want for drinks. I ordered a orange soda which was like water. The server later became very prompt on asking if everything was okay and if he could get us anything but by then I just wanted to pay the bill to get out of there. I ordered the lemon chicken with raisin rice. The food definitely wasn't worth it. I took about two bites because the food tasted like a frozen TV dinner.

This wasn't offered, but had to be requested by us after a detailed explanation of what was wrong. Upon receiving the bill and seeing what ""a little off"" was, we asked for her again to inquire as to if we could just have the entire newly ordered entree removed (it was 15.99, and we were given $10 off). We were all taken aback by a discourteous, reluctant and unfriendly ""ok, I'll take off the $5.99"" before she walked off without another word.

4,Steven Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,18,98.0,1.0,2017-12-14,"Ordered delivery from amazon. This location ruined my good memories with Applebee's. When I live in Michigan I used to go to Applebee's for dinner. And it was amazing. But here nah, good luck with who ever owns this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,2.2,2.02,2.02,,2.092
6,Ibrahim R.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",41,3,,1.0,2017-12-16,"Very fun atmosphere, Terrible service after I ordered it took 30-45 min to get one plate. After I got my plate I finished and waited 30 minutes for my waiter to return which she would of never done if the manager asked if I needed something. Drinks are not great just sodas. When she brought back my change she did not give back the the .65 cents just the 65 dollars. I was scared to ask for something else because I would of waited longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,2.2,2.02,2.02,,2.092
1,Yvonne B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,4.0,1.0,2017-12-29,"Apathetic, bad attitudes, awful customer service, SLOW, understaffed, overall POORLY MANAGED.  Once the host finally seated us in the mostly empty restaurant he left us with no menus the ENTIRE time or the high chairs we requested for 2 of our 5 children. I went up to him to ask then he said he would bring them. Then after 10 more mins of no one acknowledging us my husband got up, went to the hostess booth and got them himself.  In the host's defense, he clearly was overworked as a host, server and bus boy assigned to multiple sections. Meanwhile there were literally about 3 female servers who Im hoping were all on break at the same time cause they had NO shame about standing around talkin and laughing.  The booth he sat us in still had the clean-up rag on the table, a dirty saucer and the ketchup rack was on the seat. I ended up moving all of this to a table that had serving trays with half eaten dishes on it.  The waitress who we figured was assigned to that area NEVER once came over to us to.acknowledge us, give us water, or.apologize about the delay. She looked at us several times almost as if our presence annoyed her because she now had more work.  Needless to say after about nearly 20 mins of literally not one person acknowledging us we packed up our 5 kids and left. Not one server who we passed on our way out attempted to ask us what the issue was. So I pulled one to the  .express my discontent. Although she apologized and seemed sincere we felt our complaints fell on deaf ears.  THE WORST!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,2.2,2.02,2.02,,2.092
7,Jasmyn F.,"Freeport, NY",1,1,,1.0,2017-12-29,"Unsatisfied with the customer service and attitude of the bartender I dealt with. Came for the enjoyable, chill atmosphere that I receive at other applebees near where I live (Long Island). It is clear the management needs some work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,2.08,2.02,2.02,,2.044
3,Elba A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1.0,1.0,2018-01-02,The shrimp was raw and extremely small. And on top of that it was greasy and not even crunchy like it was supposed to be. It was soggy. I only ate one and I immediately had a stomach ache afterwards. Our waiter was not much better either. This place definitely needs to be shut down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14,2.08,2.01,2.01,,2.0380000000000003
