I went there on the 23rd of may 2012, had the Cajun shrimp pasta and went home only to run to the bathroom sick like and dog. All night my stomach was hurting, only to find out that now I have food poisoning, I called Applebee's to speak to the managers to let them know what happened, and today is the 25th of may, and they are still serving that Cajan dish to folks. I won't be back. Good thing my three year old is picky, he only had bottled chocolate milk. He's smart.

24,Djinou J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,54,20.0,1.0,2012-07-23,"I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this Applebees SUCKS. I live only a few blocks away but I will be starving and bored on a Friday night and I still won't go here. I've been here numerous times and each time it's half assed service and half assed food. Now I understand this is Applebees AKA a fancier version of McDonald's, but there is no reason for it to be this bad. This establishment is just ghetto in terms of service. I do disagree with the other review that you'll need a bulletproof vest; thats a bit of an exaggeration , its def not that crazy or dangerous over there. Most Applebees in nyc are terrible and i dont know why. When i lived in upstate NY, the Applebees was so good you would think they were a completely different chain than the ones in the city. The appetizers are literally half of what I'm used to gettig at my upstate location. We ordered the boneless wings and got 4 pieces that barely had sauce on them. The mozzerella sticks come cold. The burgers canbe good but the meat is always cooked wrongly.  I order medium-well and I receive well done. Dont you dare order well done or you will get it a rock on a bun. Maybe I should order medium-rare next time and they'll get it right? Idk. Servers usually disappear after dropping off your food and never check back in. Everytime I eat here I feel like I should have saved myself the wasted expectation of okay service and just eaten McDonald's or some other crap, at least I know what to expect with them. It's not worth the wait time. The one in sheepshead bay is way more decent. Just get on the B44 and go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=80,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
83,Ana X.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,16.0,3.0,2012-08-03,"I believe service has improved over the years. I remember once when a group of 4 went to dine in and the appetizers (quesidillas and buffalo wings) took 20 minutes to come. In that time our drinks didn't arrive yet. After eating the appetizers and still no sight of drinks we called the manager who told us she was sorry and when we asked to be compensated she told us that wouldn't be necessary as the drinks are coming now. The drinks didnt arrive until our meal did another 20 mins after. I stopped going for a while but recently started night classes at Brooklyn College. So the after class hang out spot was none other than Applebees. We come almost every Tuesday and Thursday. We request happy hour where a select few drinks are 5$. The appetizers are half price which makes it about 4-6$ for each item. Everything else is regularly priced. Food:  The food is hit and miss. With going so often I try many different dishes. Today its great, next week not so much. Sizzling dishes are always a MISS. It's ALWAYS burnt. When I asked the waiter if there's anything the chef can do to prevent burning (after having 3 burnt meals with rubbery rice) he said no. Its a hot plate blah blah blah the chef doesnt set the temp blah blah blah. Apparently some people like the burn. I do not. Service: Some waiters are great and since we go so often we are known by face by a few. There's one in particular that always has a scowl and a nasty attitude. My friend once requested hot water to place her utensils in and his response was ""People who do that are stupid. Hot water wont clean it anymore than it already is. Theres no soap, theres no scrubbing. Do you still want it?"" Seriously!?? She proceeded to curse him out. And where the tip line is on the receipt wrote ""word of the day: tact"" We now avoid him wheneever we go. Wait time is only long if you request happy hour and theres some kind of game for the night. Crowd: You can never control who comes to your establishment but often times I wonder what were these people thinking. Ive now seen a girl at the bar drink so much she projectile vomitted all over the place. Luckily we were done with our meal and left immediately after. People around her stayed put and just avoided the vomit. YUCK!!!! Ive seen girls with their nasty behinds sitting on the bar counter. Ive seen females so drunk and loud ready to throw down at anyone who even glance their way Females being escorted out by friends because they are so drunk A female so out of it after being escorted out she was outside banging on the  glass wall Funny Ive yet to see an out of control male patrton. Ladies get it together!!! Seriously people. Even though there's happy hour its not a lounge or club. Its still a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=100,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

13,Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515.0,2.0,2013-09-09,"So here is the problem with Applebees @ the Junction... there is absolutely no sense of urgency in the entire place.  Waitstaff/kitchen is sooooooo slow.   I've been there 3 times now.... being the optimistic gal I am I thought maybe, just maybe it wouldn't be so bad this time around. I was wrong. The most recent occasion took place last Saturday night.  It wouldn't have been my first choice but my guests had been traveling all day and were just in need of food- any food.  So Applebees it is! We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday evening and found a crowded restaurant (as to be expected) and were told our wait would be 20 minutes (ok..) so we headed to the bar and waited it out.  The service we received at the bar was the highlight of the night.  I don't remember our bartenders name but he was just lovely.  He acknowledged us immediately, placed napkins down, and offered up a couple specials.  It only took him a couple minutes to deliver our drinks.  Mine, a jumbo peach sangria, was delish.  We should have just stayed at the bar...  Not long after we finished our drinks one of the hosts came by to seat us.  He led us around the restaurant to a booth and sat us.  But didn't give us any menus.  Hmm, ok.  Fast forward another 10 minutes... we still don't have menus or a waitress.  We so should have stayed at the bar...  Waitress finally arrived, took our drink order, apologized for the lack of menus, delivered menus and disappeared.  After what seemed like a lifetime our food made its way our of the kitchen.  Appetizers up first.  They took a while to arrive but both were good.  The fried green beans are strange but really good.  The boneless buffalo wings were  served on a plate (don't they usually come in a basket?) and I counted 7.  Call me crazy but I'm almost positive that any other time I've visited an Applebees I've gotten at least 10 wings.  I bet the bartender would have given me 10. Our table ordered 3 meals- steak, talapia, and a salad.   The Lemon & Pepper Steak was cooked correctly and was decent in size.   The Oriental Chicken salad came with a good size piece of teriyaki chicken and wayyyy too many almonds - like a whole bag of almonds (overcompensating for something Applebees?)   The Blackened Talapia was forgotten.   So we wait.  and wait. and wait.  The waitress was no where to be found.  When she did surface again she went and sat in the booth behind us for a little visit.   Hmmm ok.  Meanwhile we're still missing a meal.  The whole operation took nearly 2 hours.  No one seemed to care that we didn't have menus.  Waitress was terrible at refilling drinks and was more interested in socializing than serving.   And then our table received their meals in 2 different batches about 20 minutes apart.  So frustrating! My favorite part- when we received the bill my friend looks it over and finds out that the cocktail he ordered was made with Grey Goose.  At no point did he ever tell the waitress he wanted Grey Goose.  Unless specified the bartenders would make a drink w/ the house liquor, right?   So waitress thought she'd be smooth and order up Grey Goose.  Awesome. $18 and 2 drinks later... we left Applebees.   Next time I'll just stay at the bar... or skip Applebees all together and go for pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.088,2.28

The plate was beautifully executed with colorful edible chips, rice, a variety of cheeses on my chicken and a slice of lemon to top it off. My meal tasted absolutely divine - everything complimented each other quite well. The chicken was cooked to perfection - juicy and tender.  My friend's order had fried shrimp, French fries, a small portion of cole saw and a super tiny ketchup dip (which didn't matter because all tables are provided with a big ketchup bottle, so you could add as much ketchup as you'd like). The fried shrimp was good, however the French fries were very stale and dry. It was hard to swallow and digest without chugging down water after each fry. We ended up abandoning more than half of the fries. The restaurant is pretty clean. The plates and utensils are spot on perfect. The booth that we sat in was in new condition and the restaurant itself was on it's A game. They also have a bar for you drinkers out there!

True to form, after a few hours shopping at the junction, I find myself here, because there really aren't an abundance of places to dine in the area.  Believe it or not, I would consider returning here just because....just because I enjoy it.  It is, in my opinion, definitely the best location in Brooklyn, with the most comfortable (read sensible) bar I've encountered at an Applebee's.  The food, while not the best, at least emerges from the kitchen on clean plates; no scraping of crud before chowing down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,1.9320000000000002,2.52

5,Alice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,6.0,1.0,2016-05-13,"This Applebee's was probably the worst service I ever had.  My co-workers decided that during spring break we would try to treat ourselves to a nice lunch because we rarely get the chance to do so, especially since we have a very short lunch break.  There were only 8-9 of us, there was barely anyone in the restaurant when we arrived and we ordered fairly quickly...I'd say within 10 minutes of arriving. We expected good food for the amount of time we waited, but that was not the case.  Usually a restaurant would serve you water or drinks right away, at least a good restaurant would.  Some of us ordered soda, I ordered a strawberry lemonade and another co-worker ordered a peach green tea..or some,other kind of mixed drink with no alcohol.  We waited a while, we were talking and the sodas came, but there was no water, strawberry lemonade or peach green tea.  We asked maybe 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress went to check on it.  She said that the bartender had to make it and they were waiting on her.  We waited another 15 minutes and I approached another waiter about the drinks...10 more minutes later, I canceled my strawberry lemonade and the peach green tea.  I don't see any manager on site, so  I called corporate and I kid you not, once they heard me calling corporate, we received water and a pepsi, I canceled my drink and told them to just give me a pepsi if that would make things go faster. The representative from corporate was nice and tried to help, but I'm sorry that did,t do much.  He contacted the manager and the manager came to the table.  I told the manager about our issue and that it was not okay for a restaurant to take 45 minutes to bring a drink. And that we still had not received any food, meanwhile other customers were already receiving their food even though they arrived to the restaurant and ordered later than we did.  The food came about 15 minutes later and the manager said he would figure out the check later.  The bonelss bbq wings that my colleagues ordered were cold.  Another colleague's chicken salad was cold.  My colleague and I ordered steak with broccoli and Mac and cheese.  I said I wanted the same exact sides as in the picture.  We got peppers instead of broccoli and the steak was over done.  My colleague's steak was probably almost double the size of mine and the waitress didn't even ask me how I wanted my steak.  They gave us a side of broccoli, but it tastes like it came from a bag.  Another colleague ordered a cheeseburger with fries, and the cheese want even melted.  I'm not sure whether she asked for no lettuce and tomatoes or not....but there was nothing to dress the burger up. I've never heard of a restaurant just serving a cheeseburger and fries with no lettuce or tomatoes...maybe no pickle and coleslaw, but no lettuce or tomatoes?  Another colleague had to wait an extra 15 minutes for her salmon dish.  She said it was good, but if you just saw what we ordered you'd be repulsed that this Applebee's is even still opened.  The manager wasn't even helpful at all.  He kept mentioning that our group was a big group and saying that the waitress was New.  We argued that if we're such a big party, why would they send us a new waitress to serve our group.  He then said that we should call ahead of time,next time,so he could prepare. It didn't make sense either way.  He even tried to get more business from us By asking if we wanted to have any graduation party since we're from a school.  I was shocked at how he seemed to believe the fault was not with him.  We asked for the check and that took another 10-15 minutes...maybe even more.  Then after we were finally given the check, they only gave us 50% off...the order was not even correct on the receipt, so no wonder the order was wrong. The total came to about $75....we quickly got our money together and no one came to collect the bill...it was probably another 10 minutes or so and then I just got up and gave him the $80.  We should have honestly just got up and left, because that was not even close to a $75 meal. I told him that we should not even have been charged for the sodas and he just nodded his head.  This Applebees should be stripped of their title as a restaurant or needs to be put under new management, because it doesn't seem like the manager cares about their service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.4760000000000002,2.32

111,Julie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,15,,2.0,2016-10-08,"The food at this place is decent, I suppose the same as at any other Applebee's, but the service, my god, the service. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or what (but then, like... why??), but everything with these people takes half an hour. After you are seated, you have to wait half an hour before someone actually takes your order. After they bring your order they don't check on you, even if it's been a while and you are finished eating.  I was there once on a date, and our waitress passed our table several times without making eye contact - we had to flag her down to ask her to take the dirty dishes away. Another time I was there by myself, I needed to ask my waitress for something, and she just kept walking as I was talking to her! I mean, she turned her head to listen to me, but she didn't stop, and I had to rush the words. Really, are these people trained in customer service AT ALL?? And I suppose basic common sense is not a strong suit with the people who work there, either... Then you have to wait half an hour for your check, then they take half an hour to come back and take your credit card - you get the picture. Once I was paying with cash, and no one even came back to check if I needed change - once again, I had to flag someone down to ask for it. At least twice that I was at that Applebee's I or my date only tipped 10% because the service was just so unsatisfactory. Unfortunately there are very few restaurants within walking distance of my house, and that's the only reason I ever go there in the first place. P.S.: by the way, I once called them to inquire if they have a Sunday brunch menu. The girl who answered the phone did not know what ""brunch"" was. This was an English-speaking young woman. I was astonished that someone in the food industry could be unfamiliar with the concept of brunch, but I guess given the level of service there it's par for the course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.4160000000000001,2.04

But I went there on a Sunday afternoon with my bf to grab a bite, it was the worst decision I've ever made. Frost they asked us to move from where we were seated, because they needed to make space for a party of 12, which was fine by me and to make it to us the manager even over us free dessert, so I was totally up for it. When we reminded her to let our server know she moved us, she stated that the section we're in isn't the server's section, someone else will take care of us. By the time we moved our server had already gotten our order, so the new girl didn't want to serve us. Something about not stepping over the other server's toe. Totally understandable I used to work in commission. So our server come give us our food. I had shrimp with steamed broccoli and my bf had medium rare steak. Nothing special about the scrimp dish but the steak was not our my bf wanted it, he was like whatever let it go. The whole time we were there no one came to check on us and ask whether or not we needed anything else. None of the servers came back to our tables we couldn't even get a refill on our glasses of water.  I was over it, so I called a random server told her if we could have our check please. 30 min went and gone and no one check, no one, zero customer service. I was so mad that I thought about walking out of there without paying. But as a regular happy hour college student customer I added up our meals n drink together and left the cash on the table.

Called ahead so I could just walk in and walk out, but it still took them 15 min to bring out my order (even though I called head and waited the 20min they said when it would be ready.   I brought it back to the theatre and had dinner in the projection booth -- nice and quiet indeed!  BUT then I opened the food.  The steak was as tuff as rubber, worse even, because rubber wouldn't get stuck in your teeth -- I swear, grizzle lodged between every tooth.  The tilapia was OK...broke apart nicely with a fork so that means it was fresh and it was seasoned nicely, although a bit too salty for my taste.  But then come the magic union rings -- they were rings alright, but EMPTY...no onions inside the over cooked-on-the-verge of being burnt -- HOLLOW rings of batter -- no onions. The spinach dip was slimy and had enough salt to make your lips get all puckered...salty raisin lips.  And then there was the tomato basil soup.  Tasty soup indeed, but unfortunately the container was 1/4 full.  I checked the bag...perhaps the top opened in transit and soup spilled out -- but no, not a drop.  While I was looking in the bag, I also checked to see if, hey, maybe somehow the onions fell out of the batter rings (I still can't figure out how you can make hollow rings with no onions inside). While I was pissed at not getting any onions,, I admit I was fascinated on how they did it...like when you are amazed at how a magician does a magic trick!  How they did the quarter cup of soup was not magic...just sloppiness. Aside from this particular take-out, I had gone back for sit-down meal and everything everyone has been saying here on Yelp unfortunately is true -- everything that has to happen once you walk in the door takes a half hour -- to get a waiter, half hour; to get your drinks, half hour; to get your food, half hour; and gawdforbid you need to get something extra, like butter or water...half hour.  Need to get a check so you can get your butt out of there....could even be MORE than a half hour.  I kid you not. That said, I must add that the waiters and waitresses, spread thin as they are, are usually pretty friendly, and that is saying a lot because given how pissed people must get with the long wait times, they probably get more nastiness thrown their way than they deserve.  Complain to management, not the poor put-upon lower level workers.   Yah, so downgraded to one star...like so many other reviews here.

Third occasion, upon entry to a near empty restaurant, my group, my self and a few other patrons were made to wait for a table, even though it was obvious and in plain sight, they had tables.

105,Miss C.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",102,39,27.0,1.0,2017-10-15,If I could give them no stars I would. This is one of the worst Applebees in all of NYS. The hostesses are RUDE. They seated us and then left us there. Mind you there is not much going on in there. The bar guy tells me we sat ourselves so that's why no one has served us. Ok so now I'm a liar. Ok sweetheart. Unacceptable. So no one served us. I decided to walk out as the same one who sat us told us our waitress was coming. Ridiculous. Don't bother. They change management a lot as well. It doesn't get better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,1.6,2.09,2.09,,1.894
106,Eric G.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,13,,1.0,2017-10-31,"This place is the pits. The service is awful. My friend ordered a club soda and vodka, and the server brought him vodka in a shot glass along with club soda separate but without ice. She also had no idea what beers were on tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,1.44,2.09,2.09,,1.8299999999999998
97,Mali H.,"Arlington, VA",15,30,7.0,2.0,2017-11-10,"Only giving 2 stars because the waitress was extremely nice. Was seated pretty quickly, the hostess was pleasant.  Ordered ""Cedar lemon Grill Chicken"" not only was the food portion small but it was also  very tasteless. I took one bite and couldn't finish my meal. My cousin had blackened Tilapia and that was just as bad. Applebees will never see my face again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,1.48,2.08,2.08,,1.8399999999999999

99,Diane D.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,141,1234.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"This is just your typical Applebee's. Honestly nothing special about it. It's only not to far for me so I guess it's a plus. There isn't that many bars near that area either. Just a few bars, but have a lot of more competition for places to go get lunch or dinner. Just to save the headache I will go else where unless there is a specific reason, I'm coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,1.52,2.07,2.07,,1.8499999999999999
96,C.J. N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",153,8,9.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"I had two Coronas and my lady had two sangrias but she said they were watered down. I ordered steak with French fries and mashed potatoes. The fries were on point and the mashed was really good. The steak though could have been better. My lady ordered the same except she had broccoli and mashed and she devoured her food, as she always does and even had some of my fries! Overall great place to have drinks and a nice conversation. Food is okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17,1.6,2.06,2.06,,1.8760000000000003
