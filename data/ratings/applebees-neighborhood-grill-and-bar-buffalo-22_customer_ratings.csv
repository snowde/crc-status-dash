The appetizers are also ridiculously priced for the quality you get. If you go during happy hour or during Veteran's Day (which is what hubs and I did) then you're going to get what you paid for--otherwise not so much. Service is usually very good and decently friendly so I can't knock it! Food quality is meh, food taste is meh.

18,Carlos C.,"Tampa, FL",14,26,21.0,5.0,2014-03-07,Never liked Applebees until we came to this location. The menu isn't any different than the other locations but the food is prepared a thousand times better than the other locations we previously tried. The boneless buffalo chicken wings (ok- call them bites) are awesome! We tried the fiesta salad and is off the hook! Absolutely delicious! nachos are another favorite and you can never go wrong with the steaks or burgers. The free wi-if allows us to come in with the lap top and work on my homework for university while we eat and drink- and the staff is always so friendly and upbeat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22,2.068,2.068,2.068,2.068,2.068

I would find it very hard to give an Applebees more than a 3/5 anyway since, well... it's Applebees. It's probably my least fave of the chain restaurants but I can't really stand any of them. However at this particular Applebees, the two things that stand out were (a) how cheap the food was because of the coupons of the people I was with... and (b) how I couldn't eat the next day and kept having to run to the toilet because I had an upset tummy. Yes, gross, I know. So from my experience at least... if you must go to Applebees (and I wish you wouldn't) - steer clear of this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003
27,Savannah M.,"Buffalo, NY",10,79,18.0,1.0,2014-04-19,"AWFUL! I  called up ordered 3 meals and an appetizer for the carside to go ( I was given a gift card that needed to be used) and I was told to be there in 20 minutes...I arrived in 20 minutes and then sat there in the car for an extra 25 minutes!! Making it 45 minutes total. I finally get home and they forgot one entire meal. I called them up about the missing meal and the manager offered a coupon for a free meal for ""next time"" and made excuses that the kitchen was shorthanded and backed up..Yeah well that doesn't help me when I have 3 hungry people waiting to eat and only 2 meals!! So he said they would remake it...Drive all the way back there for the missing meal and then 2 out of the three people ended up eating cold food. The manager also threw in a coupon for another meal as well- but it just isn't worth it to me after all of this.  I am sure that aggravation didn't make anything taste better however the food was edible but  small in quantity and overpriced.  The bottom line is this place is so ridiculously busy all of the time and they obviously cannot keep up with that and the carside to go at the same time. This was a first and last time for us for sure. For the amount of money spent, we can go some place LESS busy and enjoy a HOT, correct meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22?start=20,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003

26,Stephanie B.,"Buffalo, NY",0,16,13.0,1.0,2015-02-09,"Let me start off by saying if I could give this place less than one star I would maybe like a half. Decided to swing by after the movies and grab something quick to eat. First off no one came to seat us and a guy who was there for maintenance purposes had to walk us to a table . Looking over the menu he continued to vacuum around us.  When the waiter finally came to us she seemed rushed. I ordered the build your own appetizers spinach artichoke, boneless buffalo wing (specifically asking for extra sauce) and the sliders. She left and it took at least 30 minutes when no one else was here for the food to come out. As soon as she plopped the food down she knew from my look of disgust I was not happy . EVERYTHING was burnt to a crisp! I literally was able to stick my fork in the spinach dip and pick up the whole glob that's how burnt it was. Then the boneless wings had absolutely no sauce and were wayyyyy over cooked like the little frozen kind you make at home. The sliders burnt to a crisp also . ( I suppose they fell asleep in the kitchen) For the next five minutes I picked over the chips that came with the dip which were also hard as a rock and after not touching anything I decided it was time to go. I had to search for my waiter and she tried to explain how she knew the food was no where near edible and insisted she get me a take home box since hadn't touched anything. Really a box is what you think I need ? Anyways between me and my company (whose food was just as awful) we would have been better off ripping our $$$$ up and going home hungry .

20,Lakwame I.,"Buffalo, NY",43,30,49.0,2.0,2015-03-02,"Ehhh...a chain restaurant...not my favorites since I prefer local small businesses that give me ""home cooked"" taste and feels. As a result I'm writing this review simply because this is probably the best of the three Applebee's I've been to in Buffalo in terms of food but wait time and waiter service was terrible. Waited 20 minutes for our drinks and our waiter told us we couldn't order our appetizers the way that we wanted because it was ""too much work""... We simply wanted boneless wings half hot and half BBQ... Not but work at all but nonetheless we ended up with BBQ wings which were sub par. I would go here again only after thinking over all other food options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22?start=20,,,,,

I have to say I ordered the American burger, and it was actually incredible I enjoyed it very much i ordered it pink and it was exactly as It should of been juicy and and it fell apart in my mouth as I ate it , which I love the fried where not gross either, like they usually are, they were cool correctly so I was more than satisfied. My fiancées meal was not as good she ordered the pepper steak with lots of greens. She orders it pink and it didn't come pink, it came  well done, so she was upset and then I asked her to describe it as she was eating it, one word ""bland"". The decor is an Applebee's so I don't have to explain it. The service was ok she did as she was expected, didn't go above and beyond at all. Overall the meal was a 3 the service a 2 and the decor 2 so I averaged it and decided to give a three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22?start=20,,,,,
10,Anthony N.,"Buffalo, NY",19,55,77.0,1.0,2015-07-31,"Chain restaurants.....how I loathe, thee. My sister lives Applebee's. I can't imagine why, really I can't. And as an advanced culinarian, I hold a higher standard to where I choose to eat...usually. But, my sister usually wins most of these arguments.....so we ended up at Applebee's. Let's start off with how crowded it was...busy is business though right? Hostess sits us down, and we wait for our drinks with an adorable hungry 1 year old. We wait.....and wait......and wait....hey look 12 minutes have gone by with no waitress.  Finally she comes, drinks are ordered and we get to the ordering. Short and Sweet, every time I come here and get the spinach artichoke dip...the portion grows smaller, and the temperature it comes out, gets cooler. All around, we had steak. 7oz - 9oz Sirloin's cooked various ways. Mine medium rare, my fathers Medium, and my sisters medium well. Asked for some A1, which took at least 10 minutes to get to us...shocker. All 3 steals were Well done. No buts about it.  Medium well, is tricky. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt there. But medium rare...c'mon. I know you're working at Applebee's...but do you have no pride in the food you put out? Next to that. My broccoli was cold. Like, straight out the refrigerator cold. And my sweet potato fries, soggy.... Though in a hurry, I made a point to the waitress how terribly our steaks were and my sides were terrible. She sent over the manager, and I explained to him the same. He appeared to be as infuriated as I was with the meal in front of me. Offered to take only my steak off the bill......sure we'll take that I guess. So I take to Yelp to release my rage over that sad excuse for a meal. My problem lays with the cooks back there. I say cooks, and not chefs.  You may be cooking in a chain restaurants where quality and standards may be rock bottom low. But there's no reason you can't try to keep your personal standards high. I don't want my food prepared by someone who doesn't care about my food!! Which is why I'm so adamant to not give them my business.  If anyone from Applebee's corporate, kitchen staff, management, etc...sees this. I hope you realize that there's more people then just me who feel like this. The Pepsi was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22,,,,,
5,Jamie E.,"Burt, NY",541,176,1057.0,2.0,2015-10-01,"Not much has changed here. Probably been the same since childhood. Pretty confident that they use laxatives as a key ingredient in all of their food. Their drinks are way too expensive for a chain restaurant...and the lower end chain at that. So, we got water. Then we got the 2/$20 thing which was an appetizer and two entrees that you chose from the list. We got the spinach and artichoke dip which came out seconds after we ordered it, which was terrifying because clearly frozen. Also already knew this because you can buy that shit at Tops. But still. At least give me the illusion that someone is back there cutting up spinach. Entrees, we got the 3 cheese penne and the riblets. How one can get sick from riblets I do not know, but I managed. Thanks for that. The penne had a random spiral noodle in it so that was weird.  They have the things on the table where you can swipe your card yourself and pay right there. I enjoy this feature so I don't have to wait for slow waitresses (or waiters).  I don't know. It's Applebee's. If you're coming here you obviously don't care about this review because you're at an ultimate lazy point in your life where you just give zero fucks.  X's and O's!

I complained about the food and their response was anything but cold and least bothered. It was a forty dollar bill and for bad food and poor service . Pathetic .

16,Connor S.,"White Plains, NY",78,2,,1.0,2016-07-23,"Every time I try and go there I go in the hopes that the service will be better than last time, but it never is. After being seated and sitting there for 20 minutes without a single server stopping and asking for our drinks, I left and went to TGI Fridays across the street. The service is pathetically slow and the servers couldn't care less about customer satisfaction or politeness.

14,Char Y.,"Buffalo, NY",0,25,6.0,1.0,2016-07-26,"Went to this location on Saturday 7/23 and left extremely disappointed. Our server was extremely rude and careless. My fiancé asked for something to be excluded From his entree and the server replied i don't know what your talking about that's how the sauce is made. After we informed him that the Delaware and Blvd location accommodate this request, he replied let me ask the manager. After returning he stated plain as day, my manger said I don't know what they're giving him but this is how we make it. I was astonished since we eat at Applebee's every weekend. I have never been so disgusted! If the request could not be accommodated that should've been explained more professionally. We are flexible and would of ordered something else. None of our dishes were removed from the table, we were left with appetizer plates and trays crowding the space. We never received napkins at all and we ordered pasta and wings. I will never patronize this Applebee's again if any at all if this is acceptable to management. Our servers name was Adam, we arrived at 11:15am, with only two other occupants in the restaurant.

1,Laura C.,"Buffalo, NY",11,82,263.0,4.0,2016-09-28,"Years ago I had the Applebee's Oriental Chicken salad once a week after my daughter's gym class.  We occasionally get it now, and I like their call ahead car service. Last night was the first time we ate at the Walden Avenue Applebees.  The restaurant seemed like it might have recently gone through a facelift the color scheme seemed different, everything was spotless including the carpets.  There was not the sticky table syndrome I associate with most franchise restaurants like this. After some initial glitches with the self ordering system from the at table computer, which didn't actually seem to be connected to the wait station (or maybe it was our fault) the staff was incredibly attentive and pleasant. The onion rings were excellent, and the shot glass chocolate sundae was the perfect size for a dessert. My 4 stars are because I think they chicken portions in the huge Oriental Chicken salad have been reduced too far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-22,,,,,

The food looked terrible presentation wise and was equally as terrible to eat. There was a time when the food was pretty decent at this chain. That time is gone. It is obvious that the corporate money machine has tasked its team to drive out cost by purchasing less expensive food. Horrible, really..I'm not making this shit up. Here's a tip...TGIF is right across the street ,  and Bar Louie a couple blocks away. If you must go to a chain, pick one of those.

Long wait time on most nights with unoccupied tables that are open and waiting for some toasty buns to have a seat. When we walked in to be seated we were told the wait was 30 minutes. And, okay, that's a typical wait time. So we decided to do car-side-to-go instead. Upon walking through the designated door for the car-side-to-go service it was extremely awkward. You kinda get the feel that you're bombarding through the back door where the employees are supposed to be. Other locations will have a back hallway that you can stand and view the menu and place the order. So boom, we walk through the back door and just awkwardly stand next to an employee punching some info in on the kiosk. We stand there for a few seconds and ask if we were in the right area for the car-side-to-go ordering. That's when we spotted 3 empty tables that were in dire need of some toasty buns to occupy them. We were also told that the kitchen was super backed up. In conclusion, this location just seemed to need more structure.

By that time we were getting mad cause we already had our orders ready to be placed for sometime. Another table came in after us. Got their drinks and placed their order and we still didn't even get asked what drinks we wanted.
