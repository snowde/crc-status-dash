137,Sara A.,"Camarillo, CA",1,6,,1.0,2012-01-26,"I'd like to give this place a 1/2 star, if possible (I'm new on Yelp)                           First things first, we did not receive a welcome to Applebee's upon entering the restaurant. I had been wondering why I hadn't been to this Applebee's before they closed and after they had opened. Now I know why. The service is shoddy, as it took awhile to be greeted at our table. Restaurant wasn't even that busy, so I didn't understand why our server didn't greet us right away. Everyone at my table had received their drinks in a timely manner, but it took about 20 minutes to receive the water that I ordered. We had to remind the server/waiter to bring my water. As a vegetarian, there aren't that many options for one to order, especially not for the '2 for $20' deal they brag about.              Anyway, I ordered pasta from the 2 for 20 deal and asked if I could get the pasta without chicken and the server brings the food. Once he brought the food and after taking a few bites, I noticed that the pasta had bits of bacon minced into the alfredo sauce. When he brought the food, and maybe he was trying to be funny, he stated that my pasta was the way I ordered it, 'chicken and all'. Hahaha, very funny, but I didn't appreciate the sarcasm considering the fact that I was already fuming after the poor excuse for a greeting we received at the door and how long it took to be waited on and receive my water.                 After our meal, the manager came up to the table and asked how everything was and if there was anything he could do and that he had already deducted a whopping $8 from our bill. The shadiest thing is that he said we wouldn't see the deduction on the bill, we would just know that he deducted $8. Then when we received our bill, we noticed the itemized $8 deduction..Where is the consistency in his gesture? I understand he was being kind in mediating the situation, but his honesty was shady (for lack of a better word). When he asked how everything was..I stated that things were mediocre at best and the waiter should have known that there was bacon in the pasta sauce.  The server did not ask us how we were doing during our meal or if we needed anything, we had to flag him down. Meanwhile, the table next to us was receiving stellar customer service from Neil P., who knows why or how this was justified.                  Also, when Neil came around to take my picked-at salad, he didn't ask if I was done with it, he just took it without asking if I wanted a box or if I was done with my meal. At this point, I just wanted to get out of this place and go home. By the way, the waiter/server's name was Neil P. and the manager Frank Navarro was not too concerned with my overall opinion of the service (as he quickly received my answer and moved on to a different area of the restaurant) or the fact that they messed up my food order AND charged us for the salad at first, then upon noticing that I didn't eat my salad they took the charge off for the salad (nice gesture, but a little late with the customer service).                             My husband and I, plus the rest of the individuals we inform of this wondrous place are never going to return! I hope this place closes again as their food is bland, service is poor and integrity has been blown to bits. My patience was really tested in this place and I would like to think of myself as a patient and sensible individual. But.. I should have known better as this is a corporate chain which should have stayed closed! What was I thinking? Just say 'No' to Camarillo Applebee's and maybe even the other ones..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=120,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

I went here a month ago and waited 15 minutes for a table along with 20 other people when there were at least 10 empty booths. This last time I went there with my daughter and ordered the 3 cheese chicken penne pasta for diner. It was served to me in a BOWL! DOGS eat out of BOWLS. Peasants,serfs ,servants and slaves were once served their food in BOWLS. Only the gentry folk were allowed to eat on plates. That is how much inconsideration this place has for paying customers.  How the heck are you expected to cut your food when it is crammed in to a BOWL!  The bread stick was just thrown on top like an after thought. What I thought ,hoped would be a nice dinner became a moment of infuriation that I can not explain. I was so pissed I ate my BOWL full of  tasteless  over cooked gruel and paid and left. Then 20 minutes later realize  I had left my wallet and had to return still pissed to retrieve it. Never again though. I will not eat there ever again.

They are always good and that cheese sauce is so yummy! My Partner in Crime (PIC) thought the twisters should be seasoned.

But ended up getting the Riblett Basket with the southern bbq sauce. The ribs were moist, the sauce was kinda bland, will try a different flavor next time, but definitely good. The fries were seasoned just right and were crispy on the outside and just right in the inside, u know not to dry and bountiful. My PIC got the Chicken Tenders Platter which included cole slaw and french fries. reported the slaw was crisp and fresh tasting and was on the mild side meaning it was not overwhelming.

My mother ordered me a cheesecake because I was stuck at work and was craving some. She asked the waiter if they had cheesecake, they only had cherry cheesecake and she asked if they could make it plain for me since I wouldn't be home til later. Waiter was nice and said they could just not add the cherries. That was fine.  Until she actually got the to-go box. It came in a round container that you get at Asian restaurants for your to-go rice. Inside, it was much worse. It was a clump of cheesecake mushed together. The lid didn't have anything on it, so obviously they just squished it into the container or something. I guess she didn't look at it until she got home.  She warned me it probably wouldn't taste good by the looks of it. Being the person I am, I wouldn't let cheesecake go to waste and just toss it. I ate the most I could of what was inside, maybe a bite or two with the spoon they gave us in the bag. I have chunks remaining and I honestly am afraid to eat the rest.

133,Christine K.,"Lawndale, CA",0,18,,4.0,2013-06-24,"My husband and I are regulars here (we eat here several times a week). We generally are very happy with the service and the food. Our favorites tend to be: Appetizers: Wonton Tacos - The BEST! Very flavorful and unique. Brew pub pretzels - my hubby loves these. The cheese sauce has a great beer flavor, and the pretzels are always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. wings - tasty potato twisters - a bit hit and miss for me. It seems extremely hard for them to get these cooked so that they're crispy but not overdone. Generally, they're dark with a slightly scorched flavor, which my husband is happy with. I prefer golden brown, but it appears that if they don't overcook them, they turn up soggy in spots where they're bunched together. If they got rid of the crazy cut of the potatoes and just made them flat chips, it would cook more evenly. The cheese sticks and quesadillas are also pretty good. I find the bread for the sliders to be a little too mushy. Entrees: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Bourbon Street Steak. It's always tender and juicy and comes with a great sauce on top (ask for extra). I've tried several of their other steaks and prefer this one. The Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp was good the one time I had it, but I definitely prefer the steak. The garlic herb salmon, three cheese chicken penne, cup of tortilla soup, creamy parmesan chicken, oriental chicken salad, and riblets are all pretty good. Desserts: Brownie bite, a small brownie wedge and small scoop of ice cream with hot fudge hits the spot without too much guilt (either for the waistline or pocketbook at $1.49). The butter pecan blondie is super rich and deadly. (Though not as good as a pizookie from BJ's, it's still pretty darn good.) Hubby tried the chocolate mousse shooter last night and enjoyed it. Drinks: A little hit and miss. They do seem to hold back a little on the alcohol during happy hours. I like the fruity ones like the white peach sangria, and some of the fruity martinis. Hubby likes the house margarita and corona-rita. Check for their specials during different times and on different days. If you come often, be sure to pick up the $50 gift card that comes with a free $10 gift card (offered during limited periods of time).

I thought it was convenient since it was right across the street from the outlets, but boy was I wrong.  First off my husband and I had to wait to get seated when there were clearly seats available. Finally after 15 minutes of waiting and bringing it to the hosts attention that there were seats available, we got seated.  Not to mention that when we got seated we had to flag down a waiter to finally get drinks ordered but by that time we already knew what we wanted. I ordered their classic cheeseburger and fries and my husband ordered their chicken strips.  We got our plates rather quickly and once we started eating we knew why. My burger was very pink in the middle and both my husbands and I's fries were cold and unseasoned.  We tried to address the waiter but he kept saying to give him a minute and that he would be back. After a few minutes and seeing him take care of a few other tables before us, we decided it was time to go. We let the host know what had happened and he let his manager know and the manager kept saying we had to pay the bill before leaving. The manager clearly didn't want anything to do with the situation and clearly just wanted to get payed. After arguing with the manager for 10 minutes my husband and I got half off our bill and we left. Very hungry and very mad.   This place is the worst. We will not be coming back.

I arrived at 5:45 I was instantly seated which was good but we were waiting on one other person so we ordered the drinks and waited for our last guest but happy hour was about to end and we told or server to put our appetizers in. Now when she said that ""if you don't want us to put the order in right now for the appetizers you can wait until your last guest arrives and the will still be charged at happy hour price"". Ok that's great but when our guest came we put the order in and we wanted to add one more appetizer for them, the server then said that we would be charged full price. So I asked to speak to a manager which he understood quickly and that matter was resolved. When our food had came we ordered our dinner, at about 6:00, and as the other appetizers came out at about 6:15 I was thinking ok 15 minutes for our appetizers. That's ok because it's busy. Within the next forty five minutes the server came by twice both times to refill our drinks which had been empty for five minutes each time. At 6:45 we asked for the check and to just asked for the food to go because it was taking too long. I asked to speak to the manager a second time and I told him we had bee sitting down for an hour and haven't even gotten the food that we order 40 minutes ago he apologized but did nothing about it. Didn't take off a drink or the birthday dessert for my two year old she didn't get sung to or enjoy her ice cream or her corn dog. We received the food at 7:00 and the manager tried to give me a 10% off coupon but I told him I wouldn't use it because I would not be coming back.

The snores dessert had uncooked marshmallows on top, not even warm. The churro was tough. Tried to order a kids side of fries, they won't do that. Must order a basket.

However I've been coming to this location over the past 3 years and I think it's fair to say they've earned an honest review. I can easily give them 4 stars based in food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  Atmosphere: 3.5-4 stars. ITS APPLEBEES, Like how much do you really expect from a chain? It's clean, plenty of seating, sports on the tvs always, and this location personalized it's decor to the city so I think that's great. Also the bar crowd isn't bad, very good vibes all around. Food: 4 stars. Obviously you get what you pay for but with that being said I always leave feeling like I had a good meal for about $10 a person, you really can't beat it. Extensive menu and the 2 for $20 is always my groups go too. My foods been correct and tastes good so no problems there. Service: 4 stars. Not many misses. This location is good with staffing and bringing your food out ASAP. Like I've said I've been coming here for about 3 years, I one point I'd come to the bar here about once a week so I feel like I have a fair say in knowing the service. For people giving low reviews about service id say they had a bad night because for how long I've been coming here it's always been pretty good. Bar area: 5 stars! Drinks are hit or miss you really just need to find what you like. Once you do though you'll be a happy camper! Great selection of beers, liquor, and plenty plenty of mixed drinks! Mojitos, long islands, margaritas! They've all been great. Plus their happy menu is out of this world, most of these drinks range between $3.50-6 you can't beat that!!!

Great deal! The low cal food is also good and reasonably priced. Definitely not a bad way to go for low cal dining. Check out their desserts also very good.

Custom to the normal means of hospitality, this restaurant is far below the par level.  As my patrons and I sat diligently we noticed both larger and smaller groups were seated after ourselves as they only have waited for five to ten minutes while we have sat patiently for thirty. In addition, its apparent that the bar seating area's rules can change at a moments notice with the discretion of particular servers, thusly makes the idea of ""patients is a virtue"" simply obsolete. The food has came lukewarm in multiple visits with a few entrees either cold, warm  or one actually at serving temperature. The level of customer service is a serious issue that a majority of servers must be accustomed to learn once again.

We told her yes!   When the lettuce and stuff came, we asked her to please bring mayo and mustard as by then we had noticed the burgers had no dressing of any kind. She seemed surprised we requested it, but she eventually got it to us.  All the while, country Christmas music blared from the speakers. Super annoying.  The food was actually good.

AND I ordered onion rings instead of fries and they literally gave me 5 onion rings and I'm not talking about the huge onion rings that restaurants can get away with giving 5. No their onion rings are small and to top it off have like no onion in them and were very hard, didn't taste fresh at all but they have pretty good cocktails. Last time I ordered a blackberry sangria which was pretty tasty and this time I ordered a sunset margarita which is now one of my faves and AppleBee go to's for now on.

21,Tiffani H.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,1.0,2016-05-19,"Horribleeee service would be an understatement for tonight. To start... My server barely introduced herself, or even said hi for that matter.  No personality, no smile, just a server who came across very rude right off the bat. After we waited about 30 minutes to order, she brought me a refill of the wrong drink). Didn't check on us once during the appetizer. Once we got our food (which was served in a decent amount of time, by a different server) she didn't check on us once! Oh, and she forget part of my meal too.  Anyways, during the entire meal and not once did she think to ask us how the food was or if she could get us anything. And she walked by us numerous times!!!  Towards the end, I had to ask the manager for a take out box, because again she was no where to be found. When the bill came, I told her I had a gift card, and asked her what to do and she said she didn't know. I asked her ""well.. Can you ask a manager?"" And she rudely walked away.  She dropped the check off at the table after she figured out how to pay the damn bill, and didn't say thank you, have a good night. Nothing.  Now, I usually am not one to complain but as soon as I left I asked to speak to the manager and told him about my horrible dining experience (on my son's birthday, mind you) and he didn't apologize for the behavior or anything. He did say thank you for letting him know but that's as far as that went.  Very rude and very unprofessional.   I have been to this location a few different occasions, because I love the food, but unfortunately I always have pretty shitty service. Tonight topping it all.  But, this was my last time. Thank you Applebees for ruining my dinner experience with my kids, on my son's birthday! Word of advice for Applebees.... Hire better servers.

It took 20 minutes for the appetizer sampler platter to arrive. No chips or bread so when we waited 7:00 pm on a Sunday night even the fake flappy bird fame was not satisfying.  The server was pleasant; it's a family friendly bar atmosphere.  The regular hamburger is good. The beer with onion squashed in the patty was good, they forgot the sauce on the side, oh well. The Cesar salad with ""easy dressing"" was not easy, again, oh well.  The two top sirloin steaks were better than I expected. The green beans good, a little garlic I think on then, but good macaroni was ok, but like baked crusty macaroni.  I think they need one more server there, but the guy was nice.

I asked my server to exchange it comma which she did thankfully. I ordered a chicken dish on a plate that burnt my hand. I believe it was the manager that brought it out to me and he did warn me that the plate was hot comma but I didn't realize that it would be scolding hot, and fresh out of the microwave. What I really don't understand is how nice slab of gelatinous chicken, which most likely comes in Frozen, could have been pink on the inside. I ate around it, and inspected every piece I ate to make sure that it was fully cooked. The mash potatoes and the onion strings as well as the chicken all had a very bad chemically aftertaste. I was originally planning on ordering and dessert with my dinner, but I didn't want to risk getting yet another bad day.

Thirty minutes later our entrees arrived and one of them was wrong but the rest of us went ahead and started eating.

My mom is on a wheelchair since she can no longer walk. So with her being in the wheelchair, I tried to get a table away from where most of other patrons are so weren't in the way of anybody. The host led us to a part of the restaurant where nobody was sitting, and it turned out, there was no server assigned to where we wanted to sit. But our host assured us that it wasn't a problem, and a couple minutes later, our waitress arrived.  The food tasted great, and was served hot and fresh. During our time there, our waitress was always checking up on us; refilling our drinks, bringing napkins, and periodically asking how were.  I seriously appreciated how this Applebee's accommodated my family's special needs.  A great atmosphere, good food at fair prices, and a staff intent on taking care of you. My family and I will definitely be eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2,3.08,2.76,2.76,,2.8880000000000003

65,J-Money F.,"Camarillo, CA",1,48,18.0,4.0,2017-10-21,"applebee's is one of our old standbys.  They change up the menu often, and sometimes it's a hit or a miss.  Right now, it seems to be a hit as the new menu options are rather interesting.  They are running a lot of drink specials these days so that's always good. I've had some interesting drinks here.  Hit and miss.  Our last adventure they were giving out $1 margaritas, and let me tell you that you do not want one.  What do you expect for a dollar?  They have something now called Dracula Juice that the wife was quite fond of. I ended up getting one of the new chicken dishes (sorry I can't remember the name), but it was really good.  The wife got some sort of pasta dish that was yummy as well.  the boneless chicken tenders on the 2 for $20 menu are good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2,3.0,2.8,2.8,,2.8800000000000003

We were completely blown away!! It was honest the best steak perfectly cooked we've had in a long time. We were literally looking across the table from each other wide-eyed. We were not expecting anything exceptional when we visited, but we were pleasantly surprised.

63,Sarah B.,"Ventura, CA",17,6,14.0,2.0,2017-12-16,"Food was decent, what made me give two stars is the fact they let a woman bring in her dog in a fucking stroller. No service dog is ever I'm a stroller. Apparently this Applebees likes to violate health and food safety rules and regulations. On top of that our server waa not knowledgeable about the menu on basic questions like can the item hold the onions. And she liked to talk to staff more than assist her guests. Sucks this is the only Applebees in the area. If I have my way I won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2,3.24,2.8,2.8,,2.9760000000000004
60,Julie D.,"Oxnard, CA",146,318,1209.0,4.0,2018-01-08,"I always end up here by accident. And each time, it becomes a happy accident.  Dropped by yesterday for lunch. It was very enjoyable and we all walked out wanting to come back ASAP.  Got there just at the peak of lunch rush. We were seated right away though. Amy came over right away and got our drinks order.  There were some new stuff on the menu which we opted for. One of us got the unlimited chicken tenders. I got the 3 appetizer special which was a steal at $12.99.  All the food we got hit the spot. My personal favorite was the chicken tacos. I cleared that plate for sure. The steak enchilada was also good. By the time the sriracha shrimp came out, I was spent. I had two and I couldn't go on like Celine. My heart could not go on.  The service was great. Thanks again to Amy for being awesome. Shoutout to everyone we interacted with. Super dope crew.
