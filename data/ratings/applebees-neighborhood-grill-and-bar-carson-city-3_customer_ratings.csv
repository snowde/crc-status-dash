50,Neuy D.,"Chicago, IL",36,403,3.0,5.0,2012-03-19,"I've grown defensive of chains lately and find myself going to more just so I don't feel pretentious. I used to look down on them until I moved to Reno and started to miss all my chains back home. Just because I only wander into them a couple times a year doesn't mean they don't have their place.   Overall,this revisiting of chains has been a pleasant surprise. The service tends to  be better than in a lot of local places which for me is big part of my dining experience.    There is a reason there thousands of Applebee's. It's consistently good food  for cheap. There is the 2 for twenty deal. An appetizer and entree for 2 for 20. Also after 9PM, appetizers are half off.  The highlight,  they are open late. If you want dinner after 9PM and don't feel like wandering into a smoke filled casino, Applebees is your best bet.  We both ordered pasta dishes (I know right in an Applebees?) but were surprised. They were better than many of the Italian places in town.  Next week I'm going to Olive garden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.6120000000000005

9,Jessica H.,"Carson City, NV",3,4,1.0,1.0,2012-09-13,"This place is awful!  Went here tonight with my boyfriend his little brother and his girlfriend. We were sat right away. Then downhill from there. My boyfriend ordered a beer the waitress checked his ID then sent the bartender over to recheck it because she didn't know if it was okay to give him a beer or not. Next we sat there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. (It wasn't even busy) Finally after the food arrived by a different waitress everybody was starving. I ordered the fish and chips. One piece of fish was hot while the others were cold and the ""chips"" were cold as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour. My boyfriends steak was bleeding all over his plate. His little brothers girlfriends food was completely cold all the way around. His little brother ordered the steak fajitas which was the only hot food but considering it comes on a ""sizzling platter"" it was nearly impossible for it to be cold.  When informing the waitress that the fries were cold as well as the whole other dish she took one dish back while the fries were cooked then brought it back. The whole dish looked as if it was put in the microwave while it waited for the fries to come out.  After finishing what we could of the disgusting food we sat for another 25 minutes waiting for a waitress to come into sight so we could ask for the check. The waitress stopped at the table asked if we wanted dessert after telling her ""no thank you"" she proceeded to walk away having to ask her for the check as she walked off she turns around and says ""Ya I'm getting it"" in the rudest tone ever.  10 minutes later we receive the check 74.06 for awful food and horrible service. Definitely will NOT be returning to this establishment and will NEVER recommend this place to anybody.  I'd much rather go to Chilli's. At least the food is better and the service is MUCH nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436
2,Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121.0,2.0,2012-10-01,"We hit this Applebees coming and going on our trip. The first time we went we were oh so tired after a long day driving. Honestly it was not our first choice but Olive Garden had 60+ minute wait, so Applebees got our vote. We had a lovely server, but unfortunately several things we ordered they had ""run out of"", including baked potatos.    The food was adequate and our server was pleasant. Sooooo on our return trip, rather then look for somewhere else to eat after another long day driving we went back. We had what was a new server.  Honestly after a long days drive I am not wanting to train their new employees.  I asked for a veggie burger, to which she promptly told me they did not have them.  Really.  I said how about you go ask  (since they say they have them in little print on the menu) imagine her surprise when she told me they did have them. I ordered a dinner salad as well, you know something that should come before your meal. Whoops she forgot it when she brought all the food.  Whoops she messed up my order also.   I will say the manager did come by and she did take my salad off the check- oh wait I never got it-  and then my veggie burger.  I would have rather had a hassle free dinner and paid my $7.

Yes, my friends, I'm talking about the Ziosk Electronic Waiter Replacer and Dining Experience Enhancer.  With this little baby, you can order any item on the menu by merely choosing them on the touch screen. You can even pay your bill. There's no reason to even HAVE a waitress unless it's to actually bring you your food, and I'm sure there's a drone they're working on for that. The Ziosk doesn't ask you if you want water fifteen times, (""Really? No water? C'mon!"") and it doesn't continually touch you when it talks to you, which is more than I can say for the waitress. It doesn't seem to screw up your order either.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do any of the cooking. But, you know, they whip it out pretty fast.

We even called the manager and told her how great our experience was. The place was very relaxing, and they had nice music (not very loud).

We definitely did not leave a tip. On top of that, my dad ordered the All-In burger, which came out to be the size of a mcdonalds burger. With the fries being a not so generous helping either. Same with my boyfriend's meal was very small. The food also wasn't very good, I'd say pretty basic.

I eaten there several times, and have been unimpressed.  Service is ok, but that really doesn't matter since their food is pretty forgettable.  Prices are fair considering the generic food.

I must admit we stopped by.on our drive just for something light. Hubby and i shared the fish and chips. Delicious fish, sadly over salted fries and delicious coleslaw. My son had a combo for $9.....chose black bean soup and the cheeseburger egg rolls. Just okay and the soup was solid with no liquid.?? Now i suspect we should have tried their 2 for $20 special....think that was a mistake on our part.

25,Andrew S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,4,3.0,2.0,2016-11-16,"Beer was cold so that was good. Mozzarella sticks were more ooie then gooie but hey let's not forget what I am here for. The salt and pepper grinders.  Brand: McCormicks. Same grinder style that one could pick up at your local Kroger brand store :)   NSF approved? I think not. In a world where everyone is so conscious of political correctness it's nice to see something against the grain. Applebees taking a risk and doing what they want how they want not giving a shoot. Service is about what you expect, adequate, been here for 30 min and still waiting for a smile. Our waitress I formed us that they have gift cards. (A promotion Applebee's implied: if there is a failure to suggest a gift card you get free ooie mozzarella sticks) she said if she didn't say something she would lose her job. What a thrill. Tomato Basil soup and and Fajita roll up. Chicken Fajita roll up excuse me. It's what's for dinner. First sip of soup, the kind of warm of soup you would serve your grandmother. Your grandmother who has ms and can't hold onto her spoon so well so you only make it semi warm so if she spills on herself it won't burn her. By the last bite my soup was cold. Salad croutons, I would say, classy touch. Check arrived, assuming I didn't want another beer to wash down my feelings of regret. (Check was wrong btw) Chicken fajita time. Uhh where is the sizzle? Why does it taste like Taco Bell? Why does it come with authentic thousand island dipping sauce? And why have I not gotten a new napkin yet?  Turns out I ordered the wrap which comes pre wrapped so... no sizzle. I wonder if I'll have to visit the bathroom the same way in 25 min as I do when I I eat a beefy 5 layer. Thousand island is a traditional dipping sauce south of the Reo Grand turns out. Got my napkin after I asked, thank goodness. Paid my check via automated  Table tablet FlaCarte. Server told me to use it... she is a busy woman.

First, as I'm walking to the bathroom, I almost slipped and fell. I literally was waiting to fall backwards flailing my arms around and smack! My head hits the tile floor.   Luckily I have great balancing skills which allowed me to stay on my feet. Lol! Second, as my partner is opening up her menu, she starts to get this odd look on her face. She opens up the menu and (no joke) there were nose (?) hairs/clippings. There were so many. We called our server and she was even grossed out by it. So the manger came over to check on the tables and we informed him of what happened. He said he was sorry and explained that the servers clean the dessert menu thoroughly but not the main menus. He did comp the dinner, which was very nice.
