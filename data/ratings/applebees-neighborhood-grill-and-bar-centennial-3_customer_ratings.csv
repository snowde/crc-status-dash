18,S. J. C.,"Littleton, CO",0,60,,1.0,2012-06-27,"We had dinner at this Applebee's a couple of weeks ago after not having been there in several years. The waitress specifically asked if I wanted my burger cooked through or with a little pink, the inference being that it would be cooked to order. I requested my burger pink. It arrived overcooked, dried out, and had clearly been cooked several hours earlier. I mentioned thiis to the manager. He looked me right in the eye and said, ""Oh, no. We don't ever cook our hamburgers in advance.""  Yeah, right. We stupidly gave the place another chance this evening. Same song and dance from the waitress; same request for medium-rare; same dried out, overdone burger that was probably left over from lunch. I guess they think you're going to load it up with mustard and mayo and won't even notice, but I don't put any of that stuff on my burger so it's pretty easy to tell when it's cooked to order and when it's been cooked hours in advance. It was also about 80 degrees in there. Maybe they hadn't paid the electric bill.  There won't be a third time at this place. Bottom line: If the food at this Applebee's is any indicator, it's pretty easy to see why a number of them have gone out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

I ordered it and when it got to the table i looked for the fruit and It had one slice of rotten strawberry and a few skimpy blueberry's. It looked nothing like the picture. It didn't even have bluecheese like it said it has. My husband took it up to the manager on duty and she looked through it like we were lying. The best part of our dinner was my husband ordered the chicken wings bone in and every drumette had the missing leg. My husband brought it to the managers attention and she said I don't know what happened to that one. He showed her it was wrong with every single one.

1,Steven M.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,39,17.0,1.0,2015-12-13,"I received a gift card from a friend so I decided to go here tonight with my wife. We walked in and were greeted quickly. The greeter asked how many in our party and I replied 2. He began walking us toward a table and I started hearing the sound of a screaming baby from the other side of the restaurant. He kept walking towards the sound and eventually tried to sit us as close as possible to this screaming baby. I looked at him and said, ""Nope"". He didn't seem to understand why but I requested a table on the other side of the restaurant and he said, ""no problem"". I realize it wasn't his fault that parents take their annoying babies to restaurants and then ignore them when they start screaming but he should have had the sense to not sit me next to it while it was in the middle of a fit. We eventually wound up at a table on the other side of the restaurant. We sat there for about 5 minutes looking at the menu and hadn't had anyone acknowledge us. I decided that we would leave in 2 more minutes if no one came to the table. We had 3 waitstaff casually walk past our table in that time and none of them even looked at us. Not sure who dropped the ball, greeter or waitstaff, but I didn't feel like dealing with it. So my wife and I left and went to the grocery store down the road.  Normally with this type of service I'd just ignore the establishment for the next year or so but because we had a gift card we needed to use, we decided to call in a ""Carside To Go"" order. My wife called as soon as we got to the grocery store. They asked her the standard questions and then asked what kind of car we would be driving so they could bring us our order when we pulled into the ""Carside To Go"" parking section. We did our shopping and went straight back to Applebee's. That took about 15 minutes which was exactly the time they said it would take to have our order ready. I pulled into the parking lot which I wouldn't call empty or packed. There was only one ""Carside To Go"" parking spot left. On the left of it was a handicapped spot and on the right was a person who is bad at parking their Ford F250. The spot they chose was also a ""Carside To Go"" parking spot but they weren't in the truck. Why don't they stop people from parking in those spots if they aren't getting a ""Carside To Go"" order? I don't think it would be difficult since they are supposed to come outside when someone pulls into one of these parking spaces. It turns out that they don't watch the spaces at all. We sat there for quite a while and nothing happened. We had never used this service before so I asked my wife if we were supposed to call or go in when we arrived but she didn't know. Wouldn't really make sense since they ask you about the car you are driving to pick up your order. After about 2-3 more minutes my wife said she would just go in and get the order. She walked in and came out 2 minutes later. The order was ready and waiting when she arrived.  We got home and ate our wings. 1 order of boneless and 1 order of classic bone-in. After eating we both acknowledged that Applebee's isn't really worth eating at anymore. The sub-mediocre food is very overpriced which goes well with the service they provide. If you are in this area and looking for a decent ""chain restaurant"" to eat at, I would suggest the Chili's that is kitty corner to this Applebee's. I've found that they are far more consistent with service and food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3?start=20,,,,,

However, the resturant floor was exceptionally dirty this evening, and I'm sure they weren't clocked in or were on break, but it's disheartening when you see employees standing/sitting around when half a meal's worth of food is smashed into the carpet around you.

It's just not really worth the money or the calories.  It's a typical American restaurant where most of the meals come with potato and onion as the veg, there's no other side with veg to choose and all the side salads are covered with bacon and cheese.  The food we had was cooked well, for the most part, nothing was dry or overcooked.  My meal was meant to have mushrooms with the onions but I was lucky to see more than two. But the whole experience just wasn't enjoyable.  There's no drink prices on the menu, we just ordered water till we had time to look at the drinks menu and after bringing out water our waitress (names was something like Casey or Carly) didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink. She was a bit rough round the edges too, not very professional or anything.  It felt like she didn't really want us there, we'd already explained that we'd never been there before and would need a minute with the menu, so she checked on us 4 times before we were ready to order. We hadn't finished our apps when the mains came out, and while I'm still eating my meal she is standing there asking if we want dessert! I just looked at her and said ""I'm not sure yet"" pointing at my half eaten plate. How rude!! I think she got the point after that because she didn't come back.

If you want to go there, reading this won't stop you, and if you don't, I doubt my powers of persuasion are sufficient to induce a volte-face. But! Since you're here, and since you asked, and since you're still reading this, here're my two cents... This Applebee's is fine. Went here with my wife a few days ago, a Monday night, for dinner, and we both got burgers, which is a good deal Monday night. Any burger for $6.99. And some of them get a little spendy, up to $11.99 or $12.99 normally. So not bad. We both got the classic burger. I thought it was pretty good. Prepared as requested. My wife thought hers was too ""burgery"". She said the meat really could have used some seasoning or something - it just tasted like ground beef smells when it's cooking. No real problem, just personal preference. The only issue was it took a tad too long to get our food. Also, service was fair.

They completely offered me some free dessert after they messed up on an order and they were angels. The Applebee's isn't the worst, far from that officially. I enjoyed the quick and prompt service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
25,Jordin N.,"Ontario, CA",62,59,8.0,5.0,2017-10-27,Excellent service and tasty food! I'm allergic to fish & mushroom- (two of the most common menu items) and they were so accommodating to my needs and my meal tasted wonderful. The manager even came over to ensure my steak was being cooked on a different surface and all! Everything was delicious and the waitress was incredibly sweet. Will definitely be back to this location again!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

26,Leigh A.,"Englewood, CO",234,7,,2.0,2017-12-23,I used to love Applebee's as a whole but tonight was a disappointment all around.  First they said they couldn't sit us at a booth as they didn't have enough waitresses.  Then it took forever to get our food.  Then we saw our waitress talking to everyone as we waited about 10-15 minutes for our bill.  As i type this review we still haven't received the bill.  I don't plan on coming back to this location anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
