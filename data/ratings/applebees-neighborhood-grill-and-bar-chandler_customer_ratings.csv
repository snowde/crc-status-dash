6,K P.,"Chandler, AZ",5,84,,1.0,2012-02-25,"I think most would agree, the reason for eating at a chain restaurant is ""consistency!""  Unfortunately, this location doesn't get it.  With them, ""life IS like a box of chocolates...""  The food is edible to bad, the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it, the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders, your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes, and worst of all - you are either ""Dude or Hon!""  Stay home!  Don't go!  If you live in the area and need a late night bite, there's a Denny's about one-half mile west on Chandler Blvd.  Yes, I know Denny's isn't the best either - but breakfast for dinner is never bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,

1,Terry W.,"Gilbert, AZ",17,816,129.0,2.0,2012-03-25,"I've eaten at Applebees on rare occasion.  It has never been any place I sought out.  In this case they had the advantage that they were not a McDonald's or Burger King, and they were open very late. I had the 7oz sirloin. It was adequate. Nothing special.  A little dry, and a bit gristley.  The mashed potatoes were nice, and the garlic broccoli was fine. The onion rings were fine.  Nothing special.  The breading was nice, but didn't have much flavor.  The others seemed to like their wings and the pasta dish they had.  I was told ""three stars"" when I asked about them.  But I just can't go to three stars on this one.  You might argue me up to 2.5 stars, but that's not an option on Yelp. My wife did say the strawberry margarita was good (I didn't drink it). If you have no choice, this place is OK.  Food is adequate, they have a happy hour, and they are open very late.  One of the better ""last resort"" options around midnight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
8,Erin S.,"Chandler, AZ",356,273,12.0,3.0,2012-05-08,"I go to this Applebee's for Happy Hour... I have gone for dinner, but Happy Hour is definitely my pull.  Either way, it's average... it's Applebee's.  We tend to sit at the bar, but we'll go out of our way to sit in Brandy's section if she's not bar tending!  Brandy is the reason we choose this Applebee's for Happy Hour over some of the many other choices around town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
9,Phil J.,"Apache Junction, AZ",2,7,3.0,5.0,2012-08-17,"When ever I come to this Applebee's it is packed, but I always get great service, I read several of the other reviews and don't know why most are low scored posts.  I know a lot of people that come here on Thursday night for Karaoke and they have many positive things to say about this location, especially some of the staff being very attentive.  Come on those of you out there that love this place, give them there props.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
4,Audrey L.,"Tempe, AZ",12,39,36.0,2.0,2012-09-02,"Though the service is always cheery, they messed up my order (for the third time) and I had SERIOUS acid reflex (for the first time in my life) because of the ""Cajun Shrimp Pasta"" and I didn't even eat half of it. I am in extreme pain and writing this review at nearly 2 am because I can't sleep.  I am from Louisiana. Southern food doesn't hurt me. This is painful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
2,Kris C.,"Gainesville, FL",42,135,79.0,4.0,2013-01-04,"Well, after their remodel the place no longer smells like a toilet! And they did some other things right too.  The food - definitely stepped up at least a notch if not two. I go here for their unlimited soup/ salad combos. They have regular and premium salads(in smaller portions) which are unlimited, and you can swap and try different combos of soups and salads.($5.99 and $7.99 I believe are the prices for the regular salads vs premium salads). Premium gets your the asian salad, spinach bacon and something else. I like they added low-calorie/ more WW friendly items too which are pretty tasty. I tried their jalapeno shrimp grilled plate which was flavorful but not spicy. And I like spicy. So for all the bland people this is probably more aimed for you.  I'd put it as a 1 chilli from Arribas or the baja spicy from Macayo's... doesn't touch los dos though with a pinky though. The beer is still ice cold, and although they changed their prices recently (they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing) they are still really good for happy hour.  There are a lot of regulars here for happy hour from what I've seen which can get loud.  Overall they've taken a step away from their old drive bar scene and brought it back to a decent place to eat and have a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
0,Sandi B.,"Mesa, AZ",10,52,8.0,3.0,2013-01-10,"I ate here the day before yesterday with my son and my grandmother. We were the first patrons for the day. My son had the mini cheeseburgers with french fries and my grandmother and I ordered the same dish. Sirloin steak (medium rare) with shrimp, garlic mashed potato's and a side of broccoli. I've decided that I'm going to do a celebrity style point review for this one-enjoy. Waiter was nice and gave us a lot of attention. (+10points) Strangely, he never once offered to refill our drinks. (- A gagillon points!!!!! Just kidding. -8points) Our food came out very quickly. (+7points) Our steaks came out medium well not medium rare-like we ordered. (-11points) Everything else on the dish was delicious and flavorful especially the broccoli. (+15 points) **I'm not kidding here the side dishes were excellent I was taken aback by the balance of garlic and other spices in my food. I was bummed I didn't have one of those ""my God!"" portioned sized plates...mmm, okay, onward.  The dishes were reasonably priced (+8points) My entire entree was under 550 calories which I guess, is good. (+3points) I would definitely eat here again, but from what I've read I'm not the first person to experience meat not cooked to what was specified. It would seem all the cooks at this location understand is kinda done and really done. Which, for me, means that I won't go here for steak but I will enjoy Vegetarian dishes or seafood. Also, if you do stop by try the raspberry tea it was really delicious. Oh, and one more thing I don't care to figure out how many points that came out too, so if you want to brush up on your arithmetic...no? Okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
3,T B.,"Anchorage, AK",21,295,24.0,2.0,2013-01-10,"*** THIS BUSINESS IS CLOSED ** Decided to stop by for a burger, Cowboy burger in fact.  The wait service was good, no complaints; the restaurant itself was OK, no complaints; the burger was salty, over cooked and dried out...simply terrible!!  I may go back occasionally to Applebee's but not for the Cowboy burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chandler,,,,,
