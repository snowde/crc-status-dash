We had the sliders (they were pretty good), and one of their steak specials (meh), and an order of orange chicken (less than meh).  Service was way less than stellar.  My well vodka/pineapple juice was overpriced I thought.

When its busy the wait staff is moving too fast for you to catch them if you need something and your meal feels rushed. The smiles that you get once in a while are fake and wait staff comes off as insincere. The food quality is inconsistent and usually not very good, although sometimes you can get a really good meal.

So I stopped at this Applebee's and got the Curbside (since I had my daughter asleep in her carseat). They didn't include napkins and when I actually looked at my cowboy burger, I was pretty disappointed. (pictured)  The crispy onion straws were more like unbreaded, microwaved onions, and the burger was waaaay overcooked. Even the fries were bad, limp and not crispy. It's like someone cancelled their already-made-order so they put it in the window for an hour or two and then gave to the next idiot who did curbside.  $10 down the drain for a gross burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

I looked up the menu ahead of time and was really excited about this entree the creamy Parmesan chicken.  The cheese melted on top was tasty with the chicken but the sauce and rice mixture was awful! I couldn't stand the flavor. And the sauce is in between the chicken and the cheese. The spinach had no seasoning whatsoever - salt, pepper, anyone?  I was still hungry so I ordered dessert of the cheesecake apple chiri thing - that was delicious! Vanilla ice cream with caramel topping and a sugar and cinnamon coated tortilla lightly fried with cheesecake in the center.  Also their salads were good and generous portions. I'd try something else here - but prefer other places in town over this one - however, they were closed on Mondays so this was really the only option for us.

This is my second time in here., and maybe my last. Food was ok, but I think they skimped on the amount of boneless wings. My draft beer wasn't that cold, and I believe they are called bartenders because they are supposed to tend the bar not her friends. How long could my glass possibly stay empty?

We couldn't be seated at a booth even though several were empty... they were covered with more dirty dishes. Everyone in our party of four had complaints about their food. Oddly shaped ribs, soggy salad with rubbery chicken, and soggy fish with bland veggies. Not worth the 30 bucks I personally spent.

30,Joshua Y.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,1.0,2014-09-08,"I should start this review by stating I haven't always been a fan of Applebee's, but when a friend suggested we grab a quick bite to eat I couldn't say no. But how I wish I had said no.  The service here was not terrible and probably the best part of the whole experience. Our waitress was nice and helpful with anything we had questions about. Unfortunately, she was not around often and in place was the manager who was not very personable.  Now on to the worst part...the food. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was cold and the chips were doused in grease which wasn't a good start. My main entree was the blackened tilapia which I thought would be easy enough to prepare and cook properly, but how I was wrong. The tilapia was flavorless and mushy, the vegetables were still raw in the middle, and the ""crispy"" red potatoes were not at all crispy. Overall, I was disappointed and it left a terrible taste in my mouth. As a side note, how can a Bud Light cost $4.75 at a happy hour anywhere? That to me was the cherry on the awful sundae.  This experience has finally made me say, ""I will never eat at an Applebee's again"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2?start=20,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001

31,DeAnna C.,"Tacoma, WA",7,38,8.0,2.0,2015-01-24,So I am convinced it is an Applebee's thing they can not cook a steak to save their life's.  The lady working the door was older than the hills I stood by her a good five minutes not wanting to say anything  so that I would not give her a heart attack.  I was also not sure she would hear me.  We were seated quickly. I have to say that restaurants are not spaced properly for plus sized people. We ordered and I got the Parmesan shorn and sirloin cooked medium. My kids dad ordered the Thai Seafood Salad which looked decent sized in the menu.  When we got the salad it was microscopic four ounces the manager said. $12 for a tiny side salad seems a bit much.  My steak was well done. I ordered medium. I told the manager he replaced it. This one was cooked right but just like warm the potatoes were powdery and cold. The veggies were cold not impressed. The bacon burgers kids dad got looked sad but he said it was good.  We had to ask the people to bring his onion rings cause they were not on the plate.  I ordered a chocolate mousse shorter dessert and the Oreos in it were stale and mushy.  I am not impressed the manager was apologetic but he only comped our 2.49 dessert and never rechecked back.  The server was super nice and efficient he apologized and told us he was new. I hope this guy moves on from here before he comes hardened into the Applebee's rudeness found at other location. The server is the reason I gave a two star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

Also, waited over 7 minutes for our Mimosa to arrive. Unknown when the order was placed but the bartenders was seen gabbing across the bar with another server? in purple shirt.  We got the sense that no one cares. Such lacklustre service... will not be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

After a post I just saw on Facebook about the dollaritas, I'm going to guess it was them. I did like the Spinach Artichhoke dip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
0,Nate M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,1.0,5.0,2017-11-21,"After reading many of the negative reviews I was hesitant to stop here. Not sure what happened to make so many people dislike it so much, because my experience was great.  Stopped in about 9pm on a Tuesday. Place has several guests and several more while we were there. I had the Caesar salad to start and it was quite good. Foe an entree I had the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. Great flavor, juicy chicken, and served hot so I know it didn't sit around in back for a while. Also came with some red potatoes that were seasoned nicely.  Service was great as well. Erika served us and was right on time with an iced tea refill and when it was low again another server noticed and brought one without even asking.  All around a great experience and I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
