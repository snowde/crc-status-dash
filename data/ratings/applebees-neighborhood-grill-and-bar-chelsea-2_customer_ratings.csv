16,Kellie S.,"Wilsonville, AL",20,16,13.0,5.0,2015-01-03,We have been about every 2 to 3 weeks since they opened. . Always a good meal.. Friendly service and no issues.. Happy hour meals are a great option.. For 3.99 you can grab a quesadilla or fire shrimp  and  an adult beverage and not hit $10.00.  Entire menu we have not found a bad thing .. Yes it's a chain.. But to have an option for something besides fast food in Chelsea is a welcome addition.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
15,Ash S.,"Bessemer, AL",4,37,,4.0,2015-01-05,"We have been here several times since they opened. Food is what you would expect from an Applebees. Service is always great. The wait staff hovered a bit at first, but that is expected with a new restaurant. If something is wrong with your order, they always correct it and usually give a free dessert. No complaints from our family",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
18,R G.,"Chelsea, AL",1,36,,1.0,2015-01-24,"Ok...you don't expect gourmet cuisine at Applebee's. But you don't even get decent. We started with spinach dip. It was your run-of-the-mill, from the frozen food section of the grocery store spinach dip. The chips - HORRIBLE! How do you mess up chips? They were burned with a nasty taste of old grease that needs to be changed. Yes, we sent it back. I had the chicken tortilla soup. Simply not good. It had a weird almost jellied texture. I can't begin to speculate what that was about. A few months before this visit, I had a grilled fish entrée - MUSHY! We need something good in Chelsea, because that's it for me and Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
11,Doug H.,"D'Iberville, MS",0,45,15.0,2.0,2015-05-09,"stopped in for a late lunch at about 1;30. My daughter and myself were seated right away, but no one came to check on us for about 10 minuets. We ordered our drinks and food right away. We both decided to try the lunch in 18 minuets or its free deal. My daughter had the chicken fingers and I opted for the fiesta chicken and rice. The food came out in about 8 minuets. My daughter said the chicken was so so. My chicken had a fantastic taste, but you could definitely tell it was sitting for a while. It was hard and rubbery. I would have rather waited for a fresh one than have them try to beat the clock. The rice was so dry and hard that it was uneatable.  This was my second time eating here, the first was a couple of weeks after they had just opened and it was awful then. They have moved up from one star to two stars. My daughter informed me that she knew several people that used to work there and that they had all quit saying it was a terrible place to work. I wish she had told me this prior to my second trip there. I said it before, and will say it again, its the managers fault that this place is sub par. One thing that I will give them props on is that they have designated parking for vets right up front. I have not seen that very often, and I thank them for that. At least the place is owned by Americans!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
12,Robert V.,"Columbiana, AL",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-29,Gave them tree times to get it right.  Sent the food back twice. Left without eating the manager wouldn't even cover my drink for waisting my time.  Will not return .  Gave them one star because the coke was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
13,Julie D.,"Columbiana, AL",52,13,,3.0,2015-09-26,My small children like to eat here but it is basically like any other Applebee's. Sub par good that tastes microwaved. You know what you are getting when you eat here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
14,Kevin W.,"Birmingham, AL",41,217,46.0,2.0,2016-03-05,"My first time at this location and I was not impressed.  I'm currently on a very strict diet which severely limits a menu from any restaurant so I chose off the wood fire grilled section here.  The chicken was fairly juicy but didn't have much of a taste.  I had steamed broccoli for one side.  They were fine.  Fresh enough.  For the grilled veggies they plated one piece of red bell pepper, one squash piece and another piece of zucchini.  It was pitiful.  Taste was ok but the portion was laughable.  Someone in my party ordered French onion soup which I love so I was envious until they brought it out.  An embarrassing moment for this Applebee's.  Poured in to an odd bowl and they just laid a square of white american cheese on top until it melted a bit.  A bit.  Perhaps other Applebee's elsewhere know how to make this soup correctly.  This one does not.  At all.  The other dishes at the table had various issues or complaints.  You must have fairly low expectations for a budget food chain but you should be able to expect a better experience than I had.  The servers were training new hires and they performed well.  Attentive and pleasant.  Doesn't make up the ground they lost with the food.  Also a strangely decorated Applebee's.  They definitely went off script.  Chelsea is limited so perhaps for drinks and appetizers this could work but for a meal you should look elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
9,Jeff S.,"Sterrett, AL",20,26,,2.0,2016-03-20,"Sadly, I would like to give them my support as one of the few casual dining places in Chelsea.  However, the menu changed shortly after opening and does not offer as good of selections as before. The food is so so, nothing special.  However, the true problem with the restaurant is the staff.  Management seems overwhelmed and the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, have been witness countless customers having issues with their food being cooked to the proper temperature.   Applebee's has never been a go to place for me but was willing to give this location a try given the convenient location.   However, unless they get their act together, I don't think they will survive despite limited competition.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
7,Deonica D.,"Flowood, MS",58,3,,3.0,2016-04-01,Service was decent. Food was ok. Remind them of your military discount and even then check your receipt to make sure the balance reflects that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
8,Jess R.,"Chelsea, AL",7,8,,2.0,2016-05-16,"The last two online orders have been filled incorrectly. My wife's order came with slaw and fries but she received two fries. My order did not have fries. Also, the wait time has become longer and longer. On my last visit, the order was placed at 6:04 and was not ready until 6:40. I knew there was a problem when I drove up, the to-go waiter was giving the car next to me two $5 coupons apologizing for his long wait. I really like Applebee's food and hope that this restaurant gets its' act together soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
17,Skip M.,"Chelsea, AL",0,11,,2.0,2016-06-02,I went there last week thinking that they would do better than the first time that I entered the restaurant but I could not get anyone to help me because everyone was too busy catering to the mayor. the mayor seem to have everyone catatonic. no one wanted to do anything but wait on him and cater to him and stand there until you went to sleep.  the service was poor the food was simply mediocre. I know that they have no competition for their style of food in Chelsea but that is no excuse for having the poor service and poor quality of the food the food prices are outrageous for what you actually receive. this is the 4th time that I have eaten there and not one time did I leave there with satisfaction. the food quality was poor. the employees treated me poorly. all they wanted to do was focus on the mayor. the worst part of the visit was heightened by everyone catering to the mayor and making sure that he got everything he wanted and then he left without paying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
5,Alex J.,"Birmingham, AL",28,6,,1.0,2016-07-19,Worst service ever.  Called in takeout order and waited for 20 minutes after order was supposed to be ready.  They brought out half of the order and I had to wait another 10 minutes for the rest which never came.  All of the food was cold by that time.  Worst service ever.  STAY AWAY,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
6,Stacy G.,"Chelsea, AL",0,21,,1.0,2016-08-24,"I used to love Applebee's!!!!   What in the world has happened?  The menu choices are awful.  The food, when you finally get it, is awful.  The service was absolutely disappointing. The waiters had extremely good mood...so good that they were dancing, they were yelling each other and they generally made fuss annoying us. In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something (water, more wine, the bill etc.).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
10,Regina W.,"Wilsonville, AL",0,2,,1.0,2016-09-16,"Worst experience!  Waited 20 minutes for drink, then after 30 minutes the waitress came back to retake our order because the kitchen messed it up.  30 minutes later the manger checked on us and food arrived.  The food was good, but service was horrible. We will not go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
2,Carolyn L.,"Birmingham, AL",49,82,385.0,2.0,2016-11-18,"Ok. Let me first start off by saying I'm easy to please. I rarely ever, I mean ever, complain about my meal to a server/ management  but there are times when I wonder what the heck.  Well, sadly enough today is one of those days I had to complain.  The appetizer looks like a guacamole dip versus spinach artichoke dip but I will say it was at least edible unlike the rest of the meal. Not to mention we weren't even given appetizer plates to rest our chips chips on or dip on.  Now, onto the meal.  The steaks were absolutely HORRIBLE! The temperature of the steak was cooked Med-Rare like requested however, I could not eat it. I'm not sure of the terminology but the steak would not break down.  Very hard to cut, very chewy and unable to swallow. Perhaps they call it ""gamie"" I'm not sure but it was awful! The service was good. Our drinks were full all the time. My advice don't order steak!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
4,C M.,"Pasadena, TX",0,2,,2.0,2017-10-03,"I give two stars for getting the shrimp and onion rings home. However, the sirloin stir fry was totally left out, and so one of us had to share. Have had several negative issues, but kept trying, because I like local business. Rep offered replacement and was very apologetic. But why can't this Applebee's just get it together!!  Maybe should be three stars--shrimp and onion rings are delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
3,Juli I.,"Wilsonville, AL",0,8,8.0,1.0,2017-10-08,"I have eaten here on several occasions, since I live in Chelsea and yet I don't think I've ever had a great experience...however, we continue to give them another chance in order to keep from going over the mountain or eating fast food. Last week, my parents were visiting & we needed dinner after a football game. I told them the service is bad but the food is good. However, this time, we were there for nearly 2 hours before my parents' food arrived!  My husband & son had eaten & left (because of another commitment) before my parents even got their food!!  And sadly, the manager had gotten involved probably 45 minutes before it came (after the rest of us had gotten our food).  It makes me sad that this is the consistent kind of service we have had at our Chelsea Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
1,Chad S.,"Chelsea, AL",229,108,732.0,1.0,2017-11-13,"Let's start by saying the meal they provided at Veteran's Day was great and service, respect was awesome! Even gave out 5$ gift cards to return again! That's where this review begins. Ordered pork chop on picture on sign as you enter the building. It was not in the menu anymore because they changed today. Server didn't know they still had it but went and asked and they did so I ordered it with two sides.  First mistake displayed on apple chutney in picture but received no sauce, no seasoning no chutney. Very bland, dry and over cooked charred taste.  Second ordered baked potato and was hard as a rock Way undercooked and inedible. Garlic green beans was second side soft and way too much garlic. Every time I've eaten here and corporate was not here meal has been screwed up for me or my guests. Guess I should learn and only come when bosses are here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
0,G M.,"Austin, TX",7,145,16.0,2.0,2017-12-13,"It's a chain, we didn't expect much. We showed up as we were given a $10 food voucher. Food was luke warm, they appeared to only have 1 wait person, she was stoic at best.  Took a long time to get drinks.  Not sure what else to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chelsea-2,,,,,
