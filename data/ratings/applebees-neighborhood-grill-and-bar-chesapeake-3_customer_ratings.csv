29,Brian S.,"San Diego, CA",118,21,8.0,1.0,2012-05-23,"Most trips to Applebees is at least ok if not pretty good. My experience at this location was horrible at best. Let's start with the service. It was very prompt. So prompt, in fact, that our waitress asked to take our order as soon as we opened our menus. She came back within the minute to ask again. And then one more time. We hadn't even made it through the menu yet. Each time she acted like it was such an inconvenience that we chose to eat here. On her third visit to our table she told my wife to stop talking and decide what she wanted. I should have got up and walked out at that point but figured we were hungry enough to suffer through her bad attitude. Now the food. We both ordered steaks cooked medium. Mine was fine but my wife's was well done while her broccoli was still crispy and raw. Normally that wouldn't be that big of a deal but when substandard food is coupled with horrible service it is hard to justify paying hard-earned money for it. Needless to say, we are not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148
27,Kurt B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,3,,4.0,2012-11-13,"Ate at this Applebee's recently, sat at the bar. Obviously you don't go to Applebee's for fine dining!  But for as Applebee's goes the food was good.   On to the service, as soon as I sat down at the bar I was asked what I wanted to drink (+), I was promptly given a menu and was allowed the proper time to decide on my meal.  There was one overly excited cowboys fan but overall it was a pleasant evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
28,Pat T.,"Chesapeake, VA",23,35,38.0,1.0,2014-07-17,"I was looking forward to spending time with my family in a long time since coming back from Oklahoma. I decided that Applebee's would be great, since I miss the boneless chicken wings that they offer as an appetizer. We went up there and put our name on the list and the hostess told us 10 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed, we were still waiting, and we were told another 10 minutes. After a total of 20 minutes, we still weren't seated and my family and I ask what the problem was. Hostess replied that they are short on cooks. Unfortunately, this has not been our first rodeo like this. It has happened several times, where there would be a long wait, and plenty of empty tables around. And when I say plenty, I mean I saw a whole section with only one table occupied by a family.It was pretty sad that another family and mine left to go somewhere just because we weren't able to be entertained by a table and drinks. We ended up going to Olive Garden and was sat down within 2 minutes of arriving, and the hostess there said 10 minutes as well. Long story short, please avoid this Applebee's branch and make your way to another Applebee's or a different establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

23,Tara D.,"Exmore, VA",8,16,2.0,1.0,2015-01-01,"I do not take pleasure in writing this awful review.  Applebee's used to be my absolute favorite restaurant to eat at until I came to this one two months ago and I haven't gone back to any Applebee's since. I used to go weekly. My soup was cold. My boneless wings and mozzarella sticks looked as though they were movie theatre like heated up out of a lunch ables box into a microwave and taken out before they were done.... My husbands burger was so bloody we had to send it back and they literally took the burger out of the sandwich cooked it and put it back on the plate.  The waitress commented on a scar I have on my neck, that I got recently from a cancer surgery. Very, inappropriate.  Wish there was a star lower than one.  Will NEVER come back here, not even if there's a fire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
8,Lindsey L.,"Norfolk, VA",687,242,647.0,5.0,2015-06-21,"This Applebee's deserves 5 stars. With it being Father's Day it was steady. People were constantly coming in but it wasn't an overwhelming busy. We sat at the bar and ordered our food. We were greeted by a very sweet bartender named Chrisy.  We got the 2 for $25 and ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was really good. We also got the bourbon street steak chicken and shrimp. It was all pretty good. The skillets were blazing hot & sizzling as you can see and it kept our food piping hot the whole time we were eating. We ordered our food and it came out within 15 mins.  I understand they have new management and the results are obvious. This place is well ran, friendly and delicious.

We got seated quickly and our servers greeted us as soon as we got settled in. Even though our server had a trainee and the place was busy (Friday night) they were very attentive and very friendly. We were greeted by different managers throughout different stages of our meal ( after drink orders were placed, when we got our food, after our food) to see how we were doing. Our food came out fast and everything was cooked perfectly. I'm not really a dessert person but the apple chimi cheesecake was amazing. The outer shell was warm, thin and crispy and the inside was stuffed with creamy cheesecake and apple filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3?start=20,,,,,

For the meal we've tried the ribs,bourbon chicken,hamburger,chicken & mashed potatoes & the salmon with veggies All were tasteless and pretty bad except the salmon it was ok,a little strong with artichoke & garlic but not bad.

19,Blake S.,"Manteo, NC",23,84,,1.0,2016-08-19,This place has changed and gone down hill. They stopped serving the riblets which was there best food and my favorite. They are now using two small  sirloins to replace the bourbon street steak. The only steak they have is sirloin now and sirloin sucks. Cheese sticks were really salty. Salmon was dry and tastless.

11,J W.,"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",1,4,,2.0,2017-01-27,"Our waitress Jennifer was amazing. If we look at the rest of our experience it was bad. We were a party of two and kept it pretty basic for ordering. We both ordered ribs but got different sides.. when our food came out our sides we're all mixed up so they ""took them back to fix it"" aka scraped my side from her plate and put them on mine. Her plate had the markings to prove it. When we bit into the ribs they weren't hot. My sides were warmer than the ribs. So we complained. They offered to replace them but we declined as it took way too long to begin with and we didn't want to wait longer. The manager came out with replacement ribs for my friend in a Togo container, but didn't even acknowledge mine were cold even though we kept saying both.. He also semi blamed the cold ribs on her side which takes longer. Which has zero legs to stand on since mine was also cold and my sides were warm and didn't take long to make.  Lesson learned next time go sit and wait in line at Texas Roadhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

13,Jonathan M.,"Greenbrier East, Chesapeake, VA",24,9,,2.0,2017-05-12,A little disappointed. First time in this Applebee's. Service was very good - food not so much. Boneless wings were a little hard as if they were rewarmed. Salad was not bad but cherry tomatoes were on their last day. Wife's tomato soup tasted a little like Campbell's with some extra herbs thrown in. We're new to Chesapeake but the food we ate at the Applebee's near our home in NE was much better.

1,Ami A.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-05,"I have been to this Applebee's location twice within the same week, two days apart. A friend and I originally went there for lunch/happy hour on Tuesday. It wasn't busy at all- it was kind of empty,  actually. While we were seated, within the first 15 minutes, we witnessed another guest come in and he wasn't greeted by anyone at the front door. He stood there for a few minutes before he ultimately decided to leave because no one would pay any attention to him. That was shocking.  Our server, although nice, wasn't attentive.  She would try to walk away before we could finish ordering and we had to flag her down to come back. She would walk past us countless times, wouldn't check to see if we were doing ok or if our food was good, barely gave us any napkins or anything. And when another friend of ours arrived, she had to wait almost 8 minutes for our server to acknowledge her, and get her a water. At least our happy hour drinks were flavorful and packed with alcohol- not that anyone asked to see if we liked them.  And towards the end, I ordered a desert and waited 15+ minutes for a little sliver of a brownie. Which having given my server the benefit of the doubt thinking she may have just been busy with side work or bussing her other tables, I asked for it to be boxed up. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so I couldn't understand why it took so long to receive it. Despite everything, I tipped my server more than 20% since she appeared to be busy.  On the second occasion, a Thursday, a group of friends and I, four people all together, came to enjoy happy hour today, it was a different experience. The hostess happily greeted us and showed us to our table. Ironically, we got the same server from two days ago. Don't get me wrong, my server was nice, but the lack of attention or care towards us as customers a second time was just shocking considering we all work in the restaurant industry ourselves. Considering that, we tried to give our server the benefit of the doubt and see if the second time would be a better experience. Sadly, we were wrong.  Two of my friends who joined us 20-30 minutes after we have arrived, had to wait nearly 10 minutes to get waters, in which only one glass of water was brought out for two people. Our appetizers were good at least, and this time, unfortunately, the happy hour drinks tasted bland and watered down. It took nearly 15 minutes to receive our beverages despite sitting in a booth literally right next to the bar where we could see the drinks being prepared, only to be disappointed with the lack of flavor and quite honestly, a lack of alcohol in the drinks. The margaritas tasted mainly of sweet and sour mix, like watered down lemonade.  Our friends' entrees came out before their appetizers. They had to ask several times about their entrees and beverages as it seemed that no one wanted to talk to us. None of the staff appeared friendly and didn't speak to us much, even if we had questions about our food. We felt completely ignored and were shocked by the service we received. Our server would disappear for 10-15+ minutes without checking on us, and we had to use the tablet on the table to notify her that we needed help or wanted to order more drinks. The service was way too slow for us to even order, we contemplated going right up to the bar to order since we were right next to it.   Toward the end of our meal, one of my friends asked our server why she had overcharged her for the happy hour drinks she had ordered. She had originally wanted the $1 margaritas that were being offered, yet our server had charged $3-4 for each drink. Now, it wouldn't have been an issue had our server thoroughly explained how happy hour worked there, she simply said it was ""all about the wording you use"". We understood what she was implying, but she could have gone about the situation differently. My friend was so upset about the poor quality of the drinks, plus being overcharged, that she just wanted to pay and leave at that point.  Unlike our last visit, I actually had to cancel my dessert because it took too long, around 15 minutes or more for a small brownie. I tried to talk to the manager about it, though he explained that our service was already plating the dessert and that I could get it to go, despite the fact that I no longer wanted it. It appeared as if he was being slightly argumentative about the situation, which made us feel uncomfortable. I politely informed my service that it was nothing against her personally, but I'd like the dessert taken off my tab and that we just wanted to pay and leave as soon as possible. We each tipped her 20% individually and left. My suggestion would be to find another Applebee's location with actual friendly, attentive staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesapeake-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

You know that one place you don't really want to go to but you have no choice because your favorites are closed or you don't feel like driving that far? Yeah that's how I feel about this place. We were out running errands and Christmas/Hanukkah shopping and since this was the closest place to us we decided to get a bite to eat. The service was ok, waitress was nice but the food was mediocre but that's expected. I got a dish with mashed red potatoes and steak with onions n gravy. My potatoes were like warm, the food was bland and the steak had so much fat I had to spit most of it out(sorry for the visual). We got the two for $20 deal which came with an appetizer so we got the boneless wings and they tasted fine but you could tell they were frozen and heated in the microwave. Bottom line this has never been my favorite place and after this visit I remember why.

Today is what did it for us. We were seated at a booth that a waitress was in the middle of cleaning off (mind you there was only about 6 tables being used at the time & plenty of open ones) the hostest was great & mentioned getting a towel to clean the table off. It then took our server 10 mins to walk over to use to even get our drinks. When he came over he didn't even say his name or barely speak loud enough to hear. My boyfriends glass of water was dirty & it took like 5 mins to get a clean glass. The only other time we saw our server was when he dropped our food off, never came back to see how it was or give us refills. Not to mention half of my boyfriends food was cold or over cooked & mine over all was just room temp. Not to mentiom the lady behind us had shardes of glass in her tea & almost swallowed it. The manager did come over to talk to her but we never could get his attention about our problems. We paid on that little kiosk thing & left.
