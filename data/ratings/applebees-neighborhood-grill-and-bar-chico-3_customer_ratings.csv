116,Jessica M.,"Magalia, CA",26,7,,1.0,2012-09-01,"Went to this Applebee's on Aug. 30, 2012.  It was the second time we tried going to this place - the first time we went over a year ago, we stood there while the hostess and wait staff watched us stand there as they walked by, doing whatever they were doing.  After waiting 15 minutes to even get seated in a 3/4 empty restaurant, we left!  We should have never returned.  This time around, we got seated but it took them 10 minutes to even give us water.  Another 20 minutes later, we had a semi-decent appetizer but the food just went downhill from there.  It didn't even LOOK good.  There is something very wrong with the staff out front and the cooking staff in the back.  I will never go there again and will steer everyone I know away from ever going there.  Chico has way too many good restaurants to waste time, money and calories at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3?start=100,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

109,Opinionated O.,"Chico, CA",0,33,,2.0,2012-11-29,"Been there at different times and it's like the saying ""The difference between Night and Day""   The night time bartenders are friendly and nice place to go for some happy hour and half off appetizers specials when we have sat at the bar but when we want a full meal we prefer to sit in a booth.  Our waitress a month or so ago was very friendly but the food was a little slow to get to us although not to the point of having to make a complaint, although it was close. But it was $5 burger night and the place was pretty crowded.  The manager was very friendly asking how things were and to just let her know if there was anything she could get us just when we were about to say something our food arrived.  The manager seemed to be busy as she was going around asking other tables how they were doing so we passed on making a complaint to her.  And before we were done eating she came back by again asking how the meals were.  For the price of the burgers a good deal! During the day though the restaurant is almost a totally different experience.  Most recent visit about a week ago is what my rating is based on when the manager that day seemed to have ""Short Man Syndrome""  You know the type, full of attitude.  He was not very helpful when someone in our group had a problem with their meal and it was like we were BOTHERING HIM, but their food was undercooked from how it was ordered.  After the problem was fixed and the waitress brought the replacement meal (and she apologized) we expected the manager to come back by, but he never did.  He did stand by the bar glaring towards us talking to another guy for awhile so I'm sure he was bitching about us.   Day time, 2 Stars, max, due to the manager's piss-poor attitude.  Night time I'll give them 4 Stars, good food/drink deals.  Night time is the time for us from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3?start=100,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736

When I asked for our check, she went to get it and 5 minutes later she was over singing happy birthday at another table.

One of the benefits if eating out at 5pm for a change.  We were sat promptly and then left at our table for what felt like an eternity.  I checked to make sure I put deodorant on and I had, thinking maybe the wait staff was avoiding us. My wife and I are full sized Americans so its not like we were invisible. Deciding on what to order was quite easy as we had time to memorize the entire menu. We also had time to test each other's knowledge, my wife got 100 percent,  I got a 98 percent because we were waiting so long I had time to forget some of the items. The manager was nice enough to say how's it going while jogging by and not making eye contact. Finally after 15 or so minutes, and three more tables were sat I decided to ask the hostess if there were any waiters in my section. A few minutes later a man briefly appeared to take our drink order and disappeared moments later. We've now placed our order and I imagine I will have enough time to proofread this, and crochet the words on a handkerchief.  Long story short.

104,Christina S.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,2.0,2013-12-01,"My boyfriend and I had just finished watching a movie for a date and decided that since I had a $15 gift card that Applebees would be fun. I was wrong. The guy at the front placed us at a table seat and didn't ask if we wanted a booth or a table. A few minutes later, the same guy placed a family of eight directly next to us. My boyfriend and I wanted to move and we had to wait a while before we received our drinks and so that we could ask to move. When our waiter returned I told him that we were on a date and would like to move. He had no problem with that but once we moved we had to wait even longer for our drinks to get refilled. The place was not that busy for a Saturday night and there was no reason for us to wait. Eventually our food came but we had no silverware. The waiter kept saying out loud that he would bring it to us and kept forgetting. My boyfriend and I looked around to steal one at a table but there was none to be found. I had to ask the waiter again for silverware. By the time we got it our food was cold, or maybe it was cold already. My boyfriend and I really like Applebees because the food is good and the service usually is too. But, this time Applebees didn't plan a Saturday night very well with only have three waiters on staff. We won't be going back for a while because they need to get their act together. Oh and another thing,  I was unsure about how late Applebees is open so I called to ask the woman on the phone responded ""Midnight, like always."" If I was from another country or was visiting Chico, speaking to someone with that attitude would prevent me from dining there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3?start=120,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736
85,Riley L.,"Chico, CA",12,16,,1.0,2013-12-18,"Too bad you can't give some type of negative rating. I wasn't sure if I was just the only one experiencing bad customer service from here, but the entire first page of reviews are full of negative reviews. It's usually a friend's choice to dine at Applebee's. I hate going there because: 1) The servers are TERRIBLE. They do not check on your table and they are not very friendly. Most of them walk around with scowls on their faces and when you put in a special request for your food or tell them something is wrong with your food they get snappy. Sorry for making you do your job girls! Don't like it? Get out of food service. 2) There is ALWAYS something wrong with my food, not to mention it's a long wait just to get it. I waited 30 minutes just for an appetizer and soup. Lo and behold, my entree was out about 5 minutes later so my table was over crowded with food. My appetizer came out cold and I had to send it back. About 15 minutes later the waitress stops by and asks me if I have gotten my appetizer yet which is clearly not on the table. It comes back out COLD AGAIN.  I complained to the manager who handled the situation professionally and discounted my meal and offered a free dessert. I declined the dessert because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes just for that to come out.  Next time a friend wants to go to Applebee's I'm going to have to respectfully decline.

100,Jamie M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",226,11,,1.0,2014-04-16,"I have been here twice and both times I had awful service. I am not picking on this Applebee's alone, the others I have been to have been exactly the same and my mom has complained about Applebee's service as well. My boyfriend and I went last night because we had a coupon for $5 off $25. We were seated right away and they took our drink order right away. It took about 5 minutes to get our drinks because the waitress stood there talking to the bartender while she waited for him to open a beer. It took a very long time to open that beer. She then took our order and both of us ordered a salad as an app. She told us our salads would be out shortly and before our entrees. About 15 minutes later, a different waiter brought our entrees out. I told him that the waitress had said we would get our salads first and he looked very embarrassed and said, ""you should have gotten them first."" He was nice about it but I didn't get why he asked if we still wanted them unless he was planning on giving us a discount. So then we waited another 5 minutes for our salads. Finally we were able to eat our meal and I kept seeing our waitress walk by. Not once did she ask how our food is. She even brought my boyfriend a refill, placed it on the table as she walked by. She grunted when he said thank you as she kept walking. Finally, when we had finished our food, she came and asked how it was. It WAS good. Both times that my boyfriend and I have gone to this Applebee's we have sat in the same place, just two tables apart. Both times the long table next to us was covered in empty glasses, filthy plates, and fry baskets. And throughout our meal we watched our waitress take empty baskets and glasses from other people's tables and literally slam them on the long table. I saw the manager go and try to clean it up but that is not his job so he couldn't clean the whole thing. My boyfriend did not want to tip the waitress at all but I made him give her $3.50 because she was nice and quick at the beginning.

Hopping that Applebee's would change my thoughts. It didn't. The cook did a great job but that didn't help. I was sorry that was the only cut of steak they have.  The service was OK. Most reviews state the service was bad. Though it was slow, but I was patient.  I will be back, but not for a steak. And I hope the service will not be as reviewed by other reviewers. I was reimbursed by the manager for the bad steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3,1.6,1.82,1.82,,1.7320000000000004

42,Jacqueline S.,"Kapolei, HI",98,25,45.0,1.0,2017-06-20,"NEVER GOING BACK....... Showed up at 9pm, so I get it's later in the night. AC is broken. Fine. I accepted that it would be warm on this 104 degree day. After a long while Waitress took our drink orders. Then we sat there and watched a young gal get seated next to us. She took her order first. Ok? She eventually came back and took our order. We eventually got our drinks 20 mins later. Turns out the girl next to us either works there or is a friend or something, cause right after she took our order the gals food came out.  Keep in mind we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. 30 mins later I canceled the appetizer order because why bother after 30 mins?  Sooo, meanwhile, we are sitting there hot and hungry, no appetizer, and homie is enjoying her food and has pretty much completed her meal after two different employees sit to chat with her (including our waitress). Some of it bitching about fellow employees and some of it bitching about customers. 50 mins later the food finally comes out. No offer for refills by the way at any point while we sit there roasting. I had to go to the bar to get my son's drink refilled. Never got asked if we needed anything.  They set the plates down and my shrimp is raw except on the very tail ends where it's burnt. I immediately ask for a to go box because I'm done. I've lost my appetite and I'm just angry. This was the absolute worst service I have ever received in Chico.  My shrimp was raw, my husband says his steak was bland and flavorless. I'm glad I preserved my one glass of tea through that entire hour of waiting for our food because apparently that was all I was going to get.  I want to call the manager to tell him how awful this experience was, but there's no point, as there's nothing that can be done to rectify this situation. I'm never going back. No more chances. The last few times we have gone has not been good and this is the last straw. Goodbye forever Applebee's. Don't go there.

Or ask how things were going. He literally ignored us. The only two times we were served was from a female waitress from a different part of the floor. We received our food last after been the first in the section and only people in the section when we ordered might I add!! I will never be coming back.

52,Joe B.,"Chico, CA",0,69,5.0,1.0,2017-07-06,"This is an update to my last review 5 years ago. Decided to give it another try as I hoped the service would be better. Service was a little better than last time but they still forgot napkins and silverware twice. Food was just ok. What disgusted me the most was how filthy and booths and blinds are. The sun was shining in our eyes so I shut the blinds. I saw ketchup, mustard, boogers, and a dead bug on the window sill. Then I looked closer at the booth seats and there was greasy finger marks all over along with some more ketchup smeared on the back portion of the booth. A little cleaning would go a long way. I guess I'll try it again in another 5 years, but until then there are other places in town that offer a way better dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3,1.28,1.76,1.76,,1.5680000000000003

21,McKenzie B.,"Willows, CA",77,18,12.0,1.0,2017-08-18,"Worst place ever. I never usually picky when it comes to food but CLEANLINESS is a MUST! I came here with my boyfriend (we usually go to chilis but decided to give Applebee's a try). Big mistake. We were seated quickly and our food came out fast... but the plates and silverware were absolutely discussing. They looked as if they weren't even washed. I lifted my plate up to move it and it felt like there was grease all over the outside of the plate. Even felt what appeared to be someone's leftover food. At this point I lost my appetite. My boyfriend order was wrong. (Was corrected by the waitress). My Mac and cheese with chicken tasted bland. Mac and cheese from a box is better. Then when we were paying for our meal, $44 for 2 people 2 meals 2 drinks? I wouldn't  complain if my food was good and the plates and silverware were clean. Then when my boyfriend and I look at our receipt the order was completely different then what our order was. Sooooo my bf flags down the waitress, she said it's someone else's receipt and must have just been put on our table. But it was the same EXACT price as ours? For a completely different order. Mind you the receipt we originally got had multiple items. Ours 2 entree and 2 drinks. At this point I didn't care just wanted to leave. I spent $50 and my experience was terrible. I spend no more than $30 at chilis. Guess I will stick with Chilis :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chico-3?start=20,1.28,1.72,1.72,,1.5440000000000003

The waitress was amazing her name was Kat she told the cook that I said he sucks at cooking and I guess he's not going to send out anymore dry ribs. She asked me if I wanted another plate but I declined just the fact that they were all going to be dry!
