8,Timothy C.,"Peoria, AZ",517,512,1066.0,1.0,2012-01-20,"Before I write this review, I'm sure you are wondering ""Why was I at an Applebees at 8:00pm on New Years Eve 2011 in Clarksburg, West Virginia?"" Wow, even as I type this I am astonished at that fact! WHY WAS I THERE! Fact #1 - We were given an Applebees gift card Fact #2 - We were moving cross country and had to drive from Missouri to Maryland in 2 days Fact #3 - When all of your worldly belongings are in the back of a rental truck, your dining standards fall a bit Fact #4 - When all of your worldly belongings are in the back of a rental truck and you are in West Virginia, you don't really want to celebrate New Years Eve We had been driving all day, for about 10 hours, and our hotel was 3 or 4 exits down the highways, and we just wanted a cheap uncomplicated meal and a beer. Red Flag #1 - How long will the wait be? Fifteen minutes. How long was it until we sat down? 30+ minutes. Red Flag #2 - Can I get a Rolling Rock? We don't have that. How about an Killian's Red. Let me check. (10 minutes later the manager approaches) Hey we're sorry, bla bla, unacceptable, bla bla, but, we're out of that, here's two Bud Light Limes (worst apology drink EVER!). I'll have a Sam Adams, it comes right up. Red Flag #3 - The couple that was seated when we walked in about 40 minutes ago receives their food. TO be clear, this is 40 minutes after they sat down. But by then we had ordered, and we had the gift card, and we were happy to have a beer and not be in a rental truck cab, so we waited, and waited, and our waiter avoided us, and so we waited, and then the cows came home, and then AN HOUR after we had been seated, the SAME MANAGER (not our waiter) approaches us WITHOUT FOOD and apologizes for the wait and says that it is unacceptable bla bla and that they would cover our tab.   The food came out like 2 minutes later, and it was good (or the long day is talking), but man what a night. And you know what the kicker is? WE STILL HAVE AN APPLEBEE'S GIFT CARD. WE HAVE TO GO BACK!!!!  IT'S LIKE THE CURSE THAT NEVER ENDS!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
16,Liz R.,"Spring, TX",22,6,,1.0,2012-10-31,"Not good at all.  Slow service, overly salty food, dirty cocktail glasses.... not recommended",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
13,Rob G.,"Martinsburg, WV",20,90,2.0,2.0,2013-05-27,Went late night for a beer and appetizer.  The appetizers were half price so we got two.  Hot wings were tasty with a nice garlic tang to the sauce.  I would not call them hot.  The spinach dip was just ok.  Barkeep was nice and did a fair job of keeping the drinks full.  The staff did a lot of texting which is a pet peeve of mine but not a bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
15,Brennon O.,"Bozeman, MT",2,76,44.0,4.0,2013-07-10,"Not a busy evening.  We were seated immediately in the booth of our choosing.  Server was very present.  Food came quick and was tasty & hot.  It was just too cold in the restaurant. I kept thinking the a/c would reach its temperature, but I guess it was set below the ""make my nose run"" setting. Lol I'd still go back. The food was perfect! I'll just have a jacket next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
12,Angela S.,"Richlands, VA",0,17,1.0,1.0,2013-08-26,"Place an order for ""Carside to go"" I'm not sure why they call it that and even ask what kind of car you're driving..I say for just a min waiting then went in the side door. Stood there being ignored a new minutes until I asked someone about my order (which was sitting by the door the entire time) She said, ""Uh, Go the the bar. We don't HAVE a Carside person"" (okay..cause I know how your operations are handled) thankfully once I got the bartenders attention she was at least pleasant. Too bad they messed up most of my order on top of everything. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
10,Emmin M.,"Delmont, PA",12,138,195.0,2.0,2014-08-12,"Passing through on way back to PA from vacation. I didnt think it was possible to screw up grilled cheese and tomato soup. Applebee's managed to do this wonderfully. Grilled cheese was burnt and the soup was nasty. Wife's meal was good though.  Place was covered in WVU memorabilia and murals so that's another reason for the 2 star rating. Skip this place and while you're at it, skip the whole state if at all possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
14,Beth N.,"Clarksburg, WV",0,3,,1.0,2014-12-26,They are extremely under staffed. We waited for a table for 20 minutes (there were open tables everywhere) before someone came out and said do not seat anyone for another 20 minutes. The kitchen is too backed up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
9,Bryan M.,"Clarksburg, WV",0,64,3.0,1.0,2015-01-05,"Since my review over 4 years ago this place has went waaaaaaay down hill. We hardly ever go here any more since my wife seen one of the employees go into the restroom with their apron on to take a poop. They didn't even hang it up outside, disgusting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
4,lilly k.,"Parkersburg, WV",5,62,25.0,2.0,2015-02-07,"Applebee's review for 2.6.15 Intro: place was packed but it was the last packed on the strip. Hubby had a job here and it was hell for him and hell for me. Originally wanted to go to texas roadhouse, however it was even worse. ended up here. we waited approx 20 minutes. Staff interactions to start were hectic since ti was packed.  Wifi didn't even work and I was looking forward to using it since I had to use my hotspot all day and used up a lot of data and there was something I wanted to check out and it had to wait till home.  Order 1 (mine): 3 cheese chicken penne: first plate was very wonky. noodles were very hard and it was very hard to eat some noodles were to the point they were brown and either under or overdone. I got a new plate and the CORRECTED plate was only 40% better, if that. That wasn't very good for a supposed treat for a stressful day away from home. Order 2 (hubbys): chicken strip basket: at least he liked his and it turned out ok. Service: waitress was ok, barebones interaction due to busy place.  Overall for the visit I give it a 2 stars since it was not very organized, my food was bleh, and I had a very rough day and needed a pick-me-up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
5,Jamie M.,"Huntersville, NC",5,148,44.0,1.0,2015-02-08,"Never go there on Thursday since it's karaoke night. Everyone working only cared about the ones drinking of course!!! Manager was rude & our waitress was just waiting on those drinking at other tables after sitting for 30 mins listening to those drunk trying to sing, we left! Never going back. Never received food we ordered that's stupid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
11,Kelli H.,"Huntington, WV",3,12,6.0,5.0,2015-04-28,Very very friendly staff and great food. I was not rushed and was checked on just the right amount of times. The food was perfect. I will be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
2,Phil G.,"Bridgeport, WV",119,24,11.0,4.0,2015-10-16,"Love the half price appetizers after 9pm! We are regulars for these. My family of four can each get their choice and then share them with the family. We usually drink water when eating at a restaurant to save money.  Our favorites are the cheese sticks, spinach dip and chips, sweet chilli or asian boneless tenders and an order of wonton tacos.  If we are willing to pay the $6 price, the Lava Cake with Ice Cream is incredible! The sauce on the top and inside the cake is great but the added ice cream just sets it off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
7,Jim T.,"Bridgeport, WV",6,87,20.0,1.0,2016-01-19,Not that great. Food took a long time. The servers were all rude. We won't go back until they clean up. Applebee's please send in new management and straighten this place out before it fails completely.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
6,Gina F.,"Troutman, NC",5,11,3.0,1.0,2016-04-02,"Was freezing, didn't have the appetizers we ordered on a Saturday night, tough steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
3,Cynthia S.,"Orlando, FL",1,1,,2.0,2016-07-20,"Food was very good and accurate, which earns the two stars fully. Service was far from acceptable... No smile, no greeting, Slow, rude, and never brought the drink refills that she said was on the way. We got desperate and had to pay the bill through the electronic pay because we had to get back on the road and were fearful the check might never come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
1,Timothy D.,"Grafton, WV",29,19,,3.0,2017-07-31,"This Applebee's is great if you stick to the basics. Burgers, fries, basic beers. Thanks lime chicken and cavateppi dishes are pretty okay. If you try to get fancy with your choices the quality falls off sharply. Not the best Applebee's I've been to but when I want a decent burger or cheese sticks at a sit-down this is my go-to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
0,Zsander Z.,"Gahanna, OH",2,42,14.0,3.0,2017-08-20,I had the chicken and shrimp with artichoke dip as an appetizer. The service was prompt and the food was about what one would expect from applebees. Overall it was a good experience. I have nothing really bad to say about the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksburg-4,,,,,
