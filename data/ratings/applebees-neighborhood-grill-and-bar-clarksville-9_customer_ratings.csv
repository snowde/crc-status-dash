12,Darren D.,"Clarksville, IN",1,8,10.0,3.0,2012-02-24,"The boneless wings are really good & inexpensive. It's Indiana though, so they still allow smoking in the bar seating. Other than that it's all good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
17,Mark A.,"Clarksville, IN",0,19,,3.0,2012-10-15,"Typical Applebee's. food is ok. Staff is ok. Staff pretty familiar work ""regulars"" at the bar. Nothing special. I go there once a year because I like there food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
16,Kristin N.,"Clarksville, IN",0,4,,1.0,2012-12-30,"They ran out of Pepsi and wings. They gave us chicken nuggets instead of wings. Gross. Mashed potatoes tasted like water. We have been extremely satisfied at other Applebee's, this one was a MAJOR let down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
9,Marie N.,"Jeffersonville, IN",14,33,30.0,1.0,2014-07-20,"We used to come here every weekend, and the location has been around for a long time. Recently they did a complete makeover, and everything was well cared for, but something has happened. It's either the animosity of the servers, who do not treat all guests equally, or its a LACK of management.  We went in today, with a bare parking lot and THAT should have been enough warning on a Sunday when other lots are busy to stop before going in..but I had a bad craving for Fiesta Lime Chicken..We get in..No one greets us..and I do count minutes of waiting.  It might help to know I put myself through college waiting tables, so I take offense personally at BAD SERVICE.  One server in the side area is cleaning tables, the bartender and at least SIX servers are in the back of the bar, all of them see us, make eye contact and no one moves to greet us. Which is weird, considering the four or five tables there are all looking back towards the bar. The hostess appears from the gaggle of servers in the back, and seeing just the two of us, asks if its the two of us.  She is nice, but clearly uncoordinated as she has to fumble through the server stand, looking for the right floor plan layout, then says follow me, passes several clean tables to get to a DIRTY one...Not kidding here folks..but she offers to clean it, so saving points there, plus she seemed genuinely embarassed with the whole situation.  At the same time, the server in this area comes out with food for another table, with what looked like just a random person helping her hand it out..No uniform...not the kind of image I would expect any Applebee's Corp would want to see.   I looked at my husband and thought, let's go to Texas Roadhouse instead...sure they are busy..On the way out, I noted a four top with no people, clean and with menus and silverware..Other people had been there and had just gotten up and left, like we were doing.  When I spoke again to the hostess, she apologized, she seemed baffled at the entire situation as well...which says this might not be the normal for this location but I'm not willing to really pay for finding out. We weon't be back and we did end up at Texas Roadhouse, which must be where all the customers were, no wait and it was great service. And by the way, I'm one of those people marketing groups love, because I will tell others exactly what happened. I think Applebees Corp needs to look at what happened after the major renovation in terms of expenditure vs customer satisfaction here at this location, because its not the decor that is driving people away, it's the service and the lack of management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
11,Matt S.,"Circleville, OH",2,4,,1.0,2014-08-03,Terrible service! No kitchen should ever send out the adult meals before the kids! We sat there for 15 min after our food arrived before our daughters food came out only half cooked. No apologies. No managers to be seen. Asked to see if a manager was available and not even a manager working at the time. What a way to run a restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
10,Jay S.,"Hanover, IN",5,6,,1.0,2014-08-03,"Horrible just horrible, the food was just has bad has the service !!

5,Kristie T.,"Jeffersonville, IN",186,570,1457.0,3.0,2014-12-29,"When we go here, we're mainly going for the location (near the mall) or for half priced appetizers.  For instance, yesterday, I wanted to watch the game and the kids wanted to go to the mall to spend gift cards.  We can go here and order some finger foods, they can walk to the mall while I drink beer and watch the game and then when they get back we can order a meal if we desire.  It's comparable to other chain restaurants.  Service has always been fine here and food is hot and accurate to what we ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
8,Steven W.,"Clarksville, IN",0,2,,5.0,2015-04-27,I have been going to this location for years. The consistency is usually spot on. Always had nice and attentive staff. Love the fish and chips. Spinach dip is always awesome also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
6,Roger R.,"Louisville, KY",22,88,8.0,3.0,2015-04-29,"We usually frequent this location several times a year. Applebee's typically has just plain ole good food. The majority of visits everything has been pleasant and they've corrected any issue immediately. So we are accaustion to a certain particular level of service. Today was not one of those days. We received menus with 2 for $20 but were charged $22. Reason we had an old menu mixed in with the rest. They did not offer to adjust bill.  Asked about senior citizen discount, waiter was clueless. He came back with credit card and slip with -$4.00. This was nice but could not figure out how they came up with it. Figured it multiple ways and couldn't come up with the amount. It's getting late, waiter did not ever come back.  Upon leaving, stopped by the bar manager and explained the menu mis-quote. She said there were old me yes mixed in the lot of new prices.  She also knew of the issue. I had to prove a bit more to get her to offer to adjust bill. The $2 at this point wasn't worth the agitation. I mentioned they should cull their menus to avoid this happening to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
3,Sam M.,"San Antonio, TX",45,358,828.0,2.0,2016-01-18,"Why oh why do I keep coming in to this chain??  They aren't closing for another hour and no tea?? Seriously. The waitress was less than enthusiastic.  Sitting at bar and the bartender is walking around with a unlit cigarette in his hand. Guess he's on the countdown.  We tried to order but were shoehorned in to ordering a burger, guess we are having a burger.  I keep saying I won't be back but we keep praying for something better. I'm giving it two stars. One for being open, two for having soap in the men's restroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
7,Tim T.,"Elizabeth, IN",0,6,,2.0,2016-07-03,"Went to this location and when i walked in the host greeted us by saying ""sit at the bar only"" I felt like i was trying to be pressured to sit there. I informed him that my girlfriend is actually underage and is unable to sit at the bar. He came back with ""I dont care about that i dont pay the fine"". very unprofessional. Second when we finally got seated (in the non bar area) the server Amanda C was very nice and attentive. We finally ordered and i got the burger, the server asked if how i wanted the burger and i informed her with a slight pink in the middle. I know that is technically under cooked food but that is how i like my burgers. Well when we got our food it came out hot which i liked. Me being foolish i did not cut into my burger or check it or anything i just started eating it. As i was eating it i noticed that it started tasting funny. I looked down and the burger was not a slight pink but a very bright pink more raw than done. That was not how i asked for my burger. Almost instantly i got to feeling sick from it. I actually had to go to the bathroom to throw up. When our server finally came back around she just check to see if we needed refills did not ask if everything was ok or anything. I finally had to tell her that the burger is way under cooked. Well she then said ""would you like for me to go back and have them to cook it more."" I informed her i wanted a fresh one ""i guess"" My food came back and i checked the burger and this one was actually done but i was unable to eat as for i was now sick due to the under cooked burger. Not once did the server offer to give us a discount or anything to assist with the bad food that i received. I have had bad service in the past but i thought it would be better by now as for i had not returned to this location for over 2 years. I would like to be contacted by someone as for i dont know if i will be able to step foot in another applebees again cause of this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,

4,Krista R.,"Louisville, KY",7,15,6.0,5.0,2017-02-02,Food was delicious. Our  server was awesome. She was friendly and knew what we needed before we even asked. We got the 2 for 20 and it was enough to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarksville-9,,,,,
1,Adam D.,"Jeffersonville, IN",0,10,4.0,5.0,2017-03-18,"We come to this Applebee's sporadically and like the salads and lite menu. But today we had a server that we definitely will be back to see. If you come here ask for Lanessa. Knows her menu and is super friendly.
