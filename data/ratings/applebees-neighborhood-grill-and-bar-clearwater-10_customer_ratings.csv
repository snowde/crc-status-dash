I've been coming to this location for 18 years and also have been to other spots from Oldsmar to Bradenton and never really had anything to cry about. A group of us used to go to the Bardmore Location after Church every Saturday night or Sunday. I also took my Wife on our first date to a Applebee's just to feel her out, kinda like a Coffee on a nice afternoon type of thing.

30,Charles L.,"Clearwater, FL",0,28,,2.0,2013-06-30,The restaurant is always under staffed for some reason. The food is bland and too saucy with pasta. They have the 2 for special. The portions are smaller and very unattractively served on plates. Stay away from the spinach appetizer with tortilla chips. The chips taste like frying oil. I had them and should have sent them back. I felt bad for my server that had too many tables for her skill level. Just another attempt by corporations to get people in restaurants and jack up the final check with add ons.

All the waitstaff say hello to me and they know what I am ordering so they order it as soon as they see me walk in the door.  The food is always hot and if there is an issue the manager will always make it right. So I would say stop by and say hello to everyone and  tell them Roland said hello.

20,Cindy F.,"Clearwater, FL",0,12,,3.0,2014-07-24,"I'll start by saying that I really like Applebee's. This particular location is just 2 miles from home so we used to go fairly often. The food is good, (the pretzels and cheese are ADDICTING!) and the staff is always friendly.  I would love to give it 4 or 5 stars but whenever we would go there, I ALWAYS saw my biggest pet peeve at a restaurant: servers who have long hair and DON'T tie it back! Seeing a server with their hair loose and practically hanging in the food just grosses me out! It's disgusting to watch someone play with their hair and run their fingers through their hair and then serve food. This seems to be standard procedure at this Applebee's location. We went there tonight because of a tight schedule and as soon as we walked in the door, we saw several servers carrying food and their hair was down. One girl was taking an order, running her fingers through her hair to get it out of her face. It's disgusting! We immediately asked to sit in a male servers section. During our meal, out of all the servers, only 2 had their hair tied back.  I won't bring my family to eat at this Applebee's again and I recently talked my employer into going to a different location for our monthly office outing. That's a tab for 14 dinners plus drinks that we took elsewhere. As I said, the food is very good but loose hair, hanging over plates of food...that's a deal breaker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-10?start=20,,,,,
29,Kyndra W.,"Largo, FL",0,12,,2.0,2014-11-29,"The only reason it's even getting a two stars is because of food. I rarely do this because I myself am a server. First off it took us over 5 mins to get greeted once we did we ordered drinks and it took so long we got our appetizer before the drinks. The 2 for 1 we got doubles just because we wanted it in a ""tall"" and when we asked the server laughed and ignored it. Awful service.

28,Lisa R.,"Largo, FL",1,2,,1.0,2015-04-11,"We have been coming to Applebee's for ages, but I was disappointed for the first time yesterday. We went to dinner with family around 5. When we were seated the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other. We asked if we could either be moved or have the music turned down and the hostesses just talked amongst themselves about not turning it down and never offered to move us. Eventually we saw the manager and he immediately went and turned it down. We ordered our food, and while we waited the sound came back up to a night club level, which is not appropriate at a family friendly place at a normal dinner time. As our food was coming out, another manager came by and we mentioned the sound level.. She gave a BS answer about the people in the restraint turning it up with the app on their phone, we were using that same app too and it does not have volume control on it. Then our food... They may have made the place look nicer and a new menu but I ordered the same thing I have for years, price was the same but it was half the size. What normally fills me up with half, left me hungry. My daughters kids meal had less food than a McDonald's happy meal. She ordered the chicken tenders and they were the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget, if there were more than 3 that may not have been an issue but she too did not have a full dinner. The only good thing was that our server was very nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-10?start=20,,,,,

Cut into it and it was rare. 2 minutes later the manager brings out the same steak, sauce and shrimp still on and said he threw it back on the grill. I cut it in half and it was still completely rare. The manager takes it back again and a few minutes later brings back the same steak that was cut into 3 times. Manager leaves and I cut into it again and once again it was rare. Finally I gave up and just told them not to worry about cooking up the steak pieces any further. The manager never came back and apologized or even offer to cook a new steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-10,,,,,
5,Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",848,2344,2389.0,1.0,2015-08-27,"10:08pm Wednesday Generally I don't like giving low reviews, but this one is for the service.  When I walked into Applebee's, there was no one at the host/ess stand. I waited, and I over heard a conversation about ""How a family was supposed to get their friend out, since he was in a wheel chair."" I stood there, shifting weight foot to foot, for four minutes, FINALLY I was seated, after being asked if I wanted to sit at a high top or a booth.  I looked at the time and noticed that 10:12 when I was sat.  I was given no silver, my table had no set up on it, but the guy who sat me asked me what I wanted to drink and assured me that my server would be with me soon.  I even saw him chase after who I think was supposed to be my server, as she headed out to the patio section, to let her know she had a table.  Time passed, as a single diner, it's boring, I got my tea but did not drink. At 10:23 a gentleman approached and asked me if he could help, I did ask why it took 9 minutes for a server to approach. To his credit he apologized and then told me that there were only 2 people on tonight - the place was rather busy, so under staffing seems like an issue to me, and he asked if I would like to speak to a manager. At this point I wasn't hungry but more irritated, Seriously, 2 wait persons for a place on a busy night is .. silly. I told him That I wasn't going to order that I was going to leave, and I did.

It was very fatty and full of salt it wins the award of the worst steak.  I complained and got a chicken stir fry. It too was really bad full of salt and some spices that didn't mix well at all.

I sat in the reserved pick up spot for a quite a while and ended up going inside to pay and receive my food. When I get home and start giving everyone there food we realise we were missing an entire entree and sides and they packaged the food so poorly that soup covered the inside of the bag and other boxes. My boyfriend called to say something and he was hung up on the 1st time! Service here is usually mediocre. Not good not bad.

The main thing I found rather annoying was that the host/hostess and the other waiter/waitress was more caring for our service and experience then the waiter we had.       I came with my family, but the waiter only cared to refill for my brother and not my beverage. His refill of ""Kiwi Sweet Tea"" was all water down. I had to drink my friends water because he came back when we were done with everything.      Even waiting for the check to be taken took 10-15 minute to come back. We were patient and polite, throughout the whole process.       It's located in a low end neighborhood where rude customers can be rude towards another customer having dinner. It's rather sad when the staff, except our table waiter, and the manager did something about it.       Would I ever come back here? Dining in? No, but drive through? Only if I'm that hungry. I rather go to the Clearwater location then this area.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had half price appetizers for lunch at the bar. you HAD to buy a drink. I got a sweet tea for $2.50. too costly for a glass filled to the top with ice cubes. I asked for two orders of boneless wings. one was hot sauce and the other BBQ honey mustard. I was surprised that they were so plentiful. one order was enough to fill me and I took the hot ones home. they were pretty good. the cost was about $5.50 each order so for a nice meal and with a gift card it was worth it.

I actually paused before posting this because I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the other servers we've had good service from in the past, but was told the manager was ""busy"" on a night that, compared to other Tuesday nights we've been, was rather slow. So here it goes! After sitting and putting in our drink orders, which we waited for 15 mins to receive, or waiter (who was extremely rude) took our order, and that was the last we saw of him before receiving our check. We waited almost 40 mins for a salad and mac n cheese dish. When another person dropped off our food, it was cold, and had clearly been sitting on the counter. At that point our drinks were dry, our food cold, and we were over it. We finally flagged down our rude waiter who dropped the check. I have NEVER not left any tip, but felt completely justified in doing so for someone who literally dropped off and picked up our menus.

1,Precious S.,"Clearwater, FL",23,86,99.0,1.0,2017-08-27,So why do I continue to do this to myself because I have a friend who actually lives close to this location and picked it.  Today was the last straw like seriously the manager at this particular location Jessica needs to go back to hospitality and management school.  When you order appetizers they are expected to come in the beginning way before your meal arrives.  My dining companion ordered two appetizers and only received one the second one didn't arrive until her meal out very gracious server Taylor bent over backwards to attempt rectify the issue. The manager refused to even come by the table.   This is the same manger on previous occasions who didn't come by when served me a burger that looked like a dried hockey puck left on a grill too long.  I am absolutely finished giving this particular location any future business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-10,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
7,Hoang N.,"Tampa, FL",4,1,,2.0,2017-09-02,"Everytime that we come to this particular Applebees, it would be around 12am or 1am.  Granted it is late and that there isn't a dedicated hostess at the front, I would always have to wait 4-5 minutes before I could get someone's attention to come over and seat us.  This could be solved easily by adding a bell at the front during late hours if they don't have a working hostess.  When we finally got seated, I thought I was going to finally have some peace and quiet with my girlfriend while we have our late night dinner, but they seated a rowdy group of 3 people next to us who talked so loudly that we had to raise our voices to carry out a normal conversation.  The joint was basically empty, why didn't they seat the rowdy guests at least one table away?  So why do I continue to come back here?  The only reason is that this place is the only place that is open until 2AM in my area.  I normally dont write reviews but this happened everytime that I visit and I really want them to get better at customer service.  And is it just me or is it that Applebees can never cook a steak right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-10,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
