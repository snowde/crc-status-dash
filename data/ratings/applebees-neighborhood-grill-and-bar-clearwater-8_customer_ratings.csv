35,Laura F.,"Oldsmar, FL",16,56,9.0,3.0,2012-11-21,"We typically go to the Oldsmar Applebees, and this one only as a second option. We came with a group of friends after my husband's softball game and they all wanted to go to this location. Unfortunately we found out that this Applebees only offers 1/2 off appetizers after 10pm, where our Oldsmar location has them after 9pm. Too bad we found this out at 9:15pm after we had already ordered drinks. My sister and I both prefer to just drink water when we eat, not because we don't want to pay for drinks, but because that's what we prefer. This Applebees location isn't very accommodating when it comes to purchasing half off appetizers with a water to drink - they require you to buy an actual drink. I can understand this rule, but they get a little crazy about it. On a previous visit, I ordered water and my husband ordered a Pepsi, and I was told that I couldn't get half off appetizers, even though my husband and I were on the same check - so I had to order a drink that I didn't even touch. When it came around to my sister and her boyfriend ordering, my sister just said she wasn't getting anything, and her boyfriend (who had ordered a soda) ordered both of their half off appetizers - and this was okay. I just don't think that's very customer friendly to push it so far, especially when one person on our check was getting a drink and could have ordered both of our appetizers.  I come from a customer service job, and I know what it takes to keep our customers happy and coming back - and this Applebees pushes it too far. In the future, I don't plan on coming back to this location since I've had two bad experiences and no help making my visits better by the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8?start=20,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

I had the Grilled Jalapeno Lime Shrimp plate, my wife and my granddaughter had the 2 for $20 sirloin steaks and mozzarella sticks.  It was all great.  It's a Monday night, not crowded, and we were seated immediately. Waitress (I think it was Krystin) was super, gave just excellent service.  I was impressed with the new small monitor on the table that you could swipe your credit card on, order food, play games, and pay your bill with.  Really made it quick.

32,Lane R.,"Dunedin, FL",53,118,4.0,2.0,2013-01-08,"I supposed I should preface by saying I don't make a habit of going to Applebee's but for some reason people keep giving us gift cards here.  On this trip our food was decent, but the establishment continues to go downhill in my book. We had a gift card for over a year and needed a quick bite to eat so we headed on over to Applebee's. I am continually unimpressed with their mixed drinks so I stuck with water this time. We did order the new pretzel sticks and while they were good they didn't taste like pretzels. They were fried with a cheese dipping sauce. Not exactly what I was imagining when I ordered them. My husband and I each ordered a burger. I wish they had more burgers on the menu because they are actually pretty good. I don't like that you can only order them pink or no pink though... umm what does that even mean? I'm scared to order no pink because I don't want it burned to a crisp. The fries would be decent, but holy salt. They were so salty. Our meals did take a while to come out so I'm glad we ordered that pretzel appetizer. Our service was strange, we had one server when we arrived and then another one randomly showed up at our table to take our order with no explanation. Then our other server came back after food was delivered to check on us and refill our drinks. I extremely dislike the new monitors they have placed on the table. You are able to order and pay on them, also play games and other things. Are they going to get rid of servers next?  The best part of our visit though was the show, half way through our dinner someone at a table nearby threw a drink on their dining partner... I'm not even joking folks apparently this doesn't just happen in the movies. Stay classy Applebee's. Thankfully we have used up our gift cards and hopefully given hints that we don't want anymore.

If this cool, clean, location with kick ass service isn't enough to convince you, then you have got to order the food correctly. I'd suggest going during half off app times, sitting at the bar where the service is attentive, up in the managers face and can't possibly go wrong. (unlike the Oldsmar location) Order off the menu apps..like the VEGGIE PATCH PIZZA which isn't listed, but is their best app. Not a vegetarian? That's ok, I'm a confirmed carnivore and I swear by this pizza. For example: The potato twisters look great, BUT it's scientifically impossible for them to turn out like ribbon fries from the fair, and that's a well-tested fact. Stick to the delectable sliders and fries, the saucy wings, and don't complain about taste if you ordered a weight watchers meal.

Sadly it did not. The sauce was cold.. like someone didn't even TRY to heat it up. Mom and I both ate a bread stick while I tried my darnedest to flag down my server, but the server was handling so many different tables. When she finally came to me to see what was going on, I pointed it out and she took it away, letting me know she was going to make it right. Shortly, our mains came out and those were ok.  A few minutes later the Manager came over and apologized - he said that the appetizer was on him.

I don't even mind waiting a few minutes for some delicious food but when I arrived home and inspected the order I was thoroughly disappointed! They gave me 1/2 an entree while I had paid full price for it..12.99 for half the food.. The worst part was that all of my food was cold. ALL of it. Not just a little warm (cooling down) due to the 10 minute drive home--COLD! The beer cheese dip for the appetizer felt like it was thawing out from being in the freezer! I've never been so unhappy about spending my money on poor service. Ordering to go should not alter the quality of the meal because it didn't alter the price.

9,Jason B.,"Holiday, FL",31,109,71.0,1.0,2016-05-26,"So let's start off by saying this was the WORST AppleBee's experience from here to Seattle we've ever had, maybe even one of the worst restaurant experience's ever. I usually try not to give one star reviews, but this one needs mention.   We arrive and were seated promptly. Our server Chelsea shows up few minutes later, and takes our order, and gives us her best fake smile the few times she stops by throughout the next hour we were there.    I ordered Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp with garlic mash, and a steak quesadilla app. The steak was very little, dry, and not good. My chicken arrived with half of a burnt mushroom and a lot of grilled onions. I asked Chelsea if this was supposed to have mushrooms like the picture, and she said yes, and gave me a fake smile. She returned 15 minutes later with a small plate of six mushroom slices which weren't cooked all the way. By this time my chicken was totally dried out and my garlic mash was cold when it arrived, so the whole meal was a disaster. I asked for extra shrimp on top of my chicken when I first ordered it, and I got a total of 7 shrimp, which I was charged $4.49 for the ""extra shrimp"".    My fiance ordered the new Cedar Grilled Salmon and Chicken Won Ton Tacos app. The chicken was burnt little cubes inside a taco shell, and the Salmon was dry as could be. After Chelsea collected our plates she asked my fiance ""the Salmon wasn't good was it?"" and gave another fake smile as she walked away. So much for the e-mail I received from Applebee's today, asking me to try their ""NEW WOOD GRILLED MENU"", what a joke.   Usually we have a manager stop by our table at the other locations, but I didn't even see one once while we were here. While Chelsea collected my plate and silverware as she dropped the check off, she dropped my knife onto my leg at the table. We usually stop by the New Port Richey location, but thought we'd try this location since it was closer, what a mistake this was.

We ordered the 2 dinners for $25 which came with a choice of appetizer.  We chose tortillas with spinach/artichoke dip.  It was delicious but the amount of dip was half what you would need to accommodate all the chips & we were trying to use it sparingly but still ran out so I asked our server if we could have ""alittle"" more.  She said sure but we never got it until after our meals arrived so she said she'd wrap it up to go.  I guess I should have said no thanks since we had wanted it before our meals, not after  - didn't think about it. Dinners were good but when we got the bill & my husband saw they had charged us an extra $8 for the dip, he wasn't happy.  All we wanted was a small amount more to finish our chips with  - we wanted it before our dinners . . . also, the server could have & we felt she ""should have"" told us we would have to pay $8 more to get additional dip.  She basically said we should have known we'd be charged extra . . . should we have known?   Since they didn't give us enough for the amount of chips we had, maybe they should cut back on the portion of chips.  AND if a customer requests more dip, maybe it would be nice to let him know of the additional charge.  Isn't  $8 alittle much besides & if she couldn't get it to us before our dinners, she could have said that might happen as our dinners would be out soon. So a very long story short about ""alittle dip"", we won't be going back right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Truly, their menu is way over healthy options BUT I was able to get a great Chicken Tortilla Soup @ 180cal and a Caesar Salad for 230cal. Happy Boy! My BOC was an unsweetened tea Arnold Palmer! We sat near the bar and the Bartender/server was polite, friendly, and impressed Gigi. She usually tells me to tip good or bad! Everything was good. Gigi loved her Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi! Thank goodness she only ate half of that 1280cal dish!  Bottom line is I would go back for a soup and salad or their Lighter Fare which ranges from Thai Shrimp Salad @390cal to a 700cal Caprese Mozzarella Chicken. I've already decided to try their Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken @580cal . So, Applebee's, you're trying and I appreciate that! See ya soon. ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
1,Rebecca F.,"Waterford Township, MI",45,38,7.0,1.0,2017-11-13,Alas $1 Margaritas and bahama mamas an't save Applebees.  After having written off Applebees after so many disappointing or downright awful dinners when my boyfriend asked me where I wanted to go to dinner last night I said Applebees.  Good grief why would I want to go to Appplebees when there are many other much better places to eat? Dollaritas. After a long week of working overtime everynight I wanted to relax with some margaritas. Ordered the 2 for $20 with spinach dip and we both ordered the new whisky bbq burgers. The waitress suggested that we order the sauce on the side because some people think it tastes like cement...the waitress said that. Uh Ok...we ordered the sauce on the side.  The spinach dip app came out and it was laughably tiny. The dip was in a small condiment sized cup and there were about as many chips as comes in a lunch box size bag of lays. In the past it was served with a small cup of salsa but not this time. Then the burgers came out with no sauce like we ordered but also with zero toppings. Per the picture of the burger on the menu it was supposed to have onion straws on it and the usual burger toppings. So we were served plain burgers. We waited for the sauce to come...and waited...and waited. The waitress came over to us 3 times and said that she had asked the kitchen for the sauce but they hadnt given it her.  Finally 10 mins after our plain burgers arrived with no sauce and no topping my boyfriend just starts eating his. I was still waiting and after 15 minutes I gave up on on the meal. I ak the waitress to please send the manager over who said the burgers shouldnt have beem served to us like that and took off my portion of the 2 of $20. But still good grief Applebees...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
3,Sarah B.,"Spokane, WA",1,46,25.0,1.0,2017-12-01,"First off, Tanner was a fun and friendly server during our visit, and our food was all delicious. I give both of those 5 stars. However we had a clear view of the bar and it was not good. We had been ordering the Dollar LITs, but stopped after we noticed the bartender, who I don't want to name drop, but I have her name (long brunette ponytail), was dipping used mugs in the cleaning solution under the counter and immediately repouring drinks in them. Now, it's been awhile since I worked in food service, but it's absolutely unacceptable to simply dip any food or drink container in solution for 2-3 seconds and reuse it. It's not nearly enough time for sanitization and skips a few procedures, not to mention the glass not even having a chance to dry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

All these negative reviews are because many people expect it to be the cheese cake factory or something. It's Applebees folks! Bathroom is always clean, food is alright and price is just right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clearwater-8,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
