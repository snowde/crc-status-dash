4,Bill G.,"Willow River, MN",47,39,8.0,4.0,2014-06-25,Went there tonight for my birthday.  Everything we had was made exactly to our requests.  The Bourbon Street Steak was great!  The waitress was phenomenal.  She checked on us the right amount and wasn't a pest like some can be.  She made great conversation and even was able to get an upgrade on my birthday dessert for free.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cloquet-3,,,,,
3,Jesse P.,"Cloquet, MN",35,3,,4.0,2016-09-07,Applebees food is amazing when they get it right. 3 out of 5 times they screwed up carrie out order. All set and done Applebees has great food!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cloquet-3,,,,,
2,Matti P.,"Bemidji, MN",101,3,,2.0,2016-11-26,"We had 4 different servers. We waited an hour for our food, once it came it was cold. Very unpersonable, didn't handle the 5 o'clock rush very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cloquet-3,,,,,
0,Denny K.,"Saint Paul, MN",23,8,1.0,5.0,2017-10-13,"Last minute spot for myself, family, and another family with us to eat....about 4 Adults and 5 little kids.  Managed to get us seated in 10min - Super quick for a Friday night!  Kara B. was our server.  Very attentive and friendly.  Very accommodating with the bunch of mini's we had with us.  Made sure to explain any wait times for food(Just typical stuff when serving a group that size....not everything makes it out at once).   Wife had peppercorn steak, loved it.  Friend had Ribs....a bit underwhelming but I thought they were fine for a chain.  I wouldn't normally order ribs at a chain unless it was specifically a BBQ chain I guess!  They had a great deal on dollar margarita's, so that was cheaper than soda.  Very good about checking on us for refills and how we were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cloquet-3,,,,,
1,Amber C.,"Andover, MN",3,30,50.0,4.0,2017-12-10,"We stopped to watch the Vikings game on our way to Duluth on a Sunday afternoon. When we got there the place was mostly empty but it did pick up later in the afternoon. We were all hungry so I thought to start with the chips and salsa while we waited for the entrees. It took awhile for the appetizer to come out and when it did arrive the chips were stale tasting. They also offer seasonal drinks so I got the pomegranate margarita, which was really good. I split the fiesta lime chicken which is amazing! I highly recommend that or getting the 2/$20 as that is an entree choice. They had the Vikings game on all TVs and a nice bar area to sit at with a larger screen. This is a good place to catch any sports game or a late night food run when they offer halls off appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cloquet-3,,,,,
