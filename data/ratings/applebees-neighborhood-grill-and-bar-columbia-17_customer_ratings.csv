14,Rebecca M.,"Bluffton, SC",0,2,1.0,1.0,2014-05-13,"If I could rate this place any lower I would. I will admit when I first walked in the people who greeted me were nice. But it went down hill from there. Every table had food under it. Our table was sticky. The plates were dirty. Our waitress was rude. She barely came to the table. She spend more time gathered with the other servers five feet away complaining loudly. She wouldn't look at us while we were ordering. And when my father asked for A1 sauce and hot sauce instead of being polite and fast she went back and complained with the other servers some more from where we could see and hear her!!!! Then once she noticed us looking at her, that's when she went to go get it. This is the first time I've ever been to the Applebee's in Columbia but the others have been pleasant and a nice experience. But I will never go to this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
11,Kris L.,"Irmo, SC",3,14,,3.0,2014-11-21,"The service was good wait staff, management was excellent. The food was salty and just ok. The prices are not bad got the 2 for 25.

10,Josh M.,"West Columbia, SC",3,7,1.0,1.0,2015-01-17,"Poor service , cold food, manager arugues whether food is cold or not. Did not want to give any type of discount. Never ever coming here again and telling everyone. Applebee s is normally hit or miss on service and food. However, this experience was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
9,Jan B.,"Columbia, SC",9,2,,2.0,2015-03-14,"There were a lot of disappointments here. We sat for 10 minutes without a server. Our particular server never smiled once. At one point he said ""I'll be right back to help you guys,"" then when he came back he didn't say anything, just stood there. I had to say ""I'm ready to order."" My meal and my kids' meals all came out at different times. The sliced apple in my toddler's meal still had most of the core in it. I was never given silverware, so I requested it with my food. The server took 5 minutes to come back, delaying my meal. The food was actually pretty tasty, so I'll give them that. But I can find yummy food elsewhere without all the other letdowns. I should have read Yelp reviews *before* I came.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,

5,Anna F.,"Chapin, SC",44,5,2.0,1.0,2015-07-09,"The worse service I and my family has ever had! Our night was a party of 20 to 25 people for a birthday party. The birthday girls husband called once (one time) to let Applebee's know earlier in the day about the party and the size. Initially, when arriving our server was visibly upset that she was having to wait on a party, she rolled her eyes even. I looked around the restraunt and it was a Tuesday evening and pretty bare. Our server, Brandi, had no tables. Well, while waiting for the rest of the guests to arrive, we realized that she was about 2 tables short of what our party was going to need. Birthday girls mom let her know this (very kindly) while getting our waters and again, our waitress was very upset. She told us ""well someone called and said there was a party of 12 then 15, not 25!"" ... She didn't say it in the nicest tone either and it was like we had to sit there and count the people and go back and forth with her. We told her our party only called one time, she just stared at us so meanly. After her long stare she dramatically pulled another table over. She then came over and told us that we are going to need to be patient with her when everyone arrives and not get angry when she is trying to figure things out!  (I'm guessing this is not her first time having issues with a party ) We said ok, no problem. It's only 4 of us sitting there at this time and it was clear that she just did not want to be at work. As the party started arriving and of course people are greeting each other and saying ""surprise"" to the birthday girl, our server Brandi was getting visibly upset again because people were not sitting down fast enough for her. Once everyone was sat, Brandi wanted to hurry up and have us order.. Well everyone rushed and told her whom is with whom. It's quite easy, ask a last name and write our order under the name but no Brandi could not do this.. It wouldn't of been stressful enough for her I suppose. Let me just say by the time we gave our order and our drinks started coming out (well most of them) Brandi was over at the computer complaining about us and yelling to other servers and even a manager. She finally came over about 25 mins later after putting in our order. I never received my drink and she told me that I never ordered one. I said ok?? well can I order it now? She rolled her eyes and walked away. Appetizers were coming now and still not one alcoholic beverage had been brought out. I asked the server that was brought in to help her out for a drink and was told I need a I.d. Ok so I get my ID and am never approached for it again. So I walk up and show it. My drink was taken from the bar to our table and then back to the bar, almost like a game. Brandi came to fill up a water and I asked her if I could have my drink now and she told me that's what I was coming to tell you, was that I'm going to bring you your drink!! I said ok thank you! She never brought it but another server that helped finally did. By then my food was already at the table. Many of our party guests were missing food and especially the kids plates were missing up until the very end. Brandi screamed that she can't handle this! and the server that was helping came by to fill up waters and teas and I told him that she seems really angry with us and we were told by him that she does get mad a lot. wouldn't this of been a good time to send management over? Nope! But the manager stood there listening and watching a far. She also listened to Brandi complain about us but never paid our table one visit.  None of the 25 people in our party were very happy with this Applebee's. Brandi, had the potential of making excellent tips off of our party, she also had the potential of making our bills higher, had she of brought us more than 1 drink from the bar and it not of taken the whole night . All we expected was to be treated like guests and humans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
13,Tracie M.,"Peoria, IL",2,15,,1.0,2015-11-21,"I have literally NEVER in my life got up and walked out of a restaurant no matter how bad the food or service was but tonight was a first.  After waiting for a server he took our drink and appetizer order.  Ten minutes later, still no drinks he comes back to take our regular order.   Still no drinks.  20 minutes later we get our appetizer, (we almost wore the appetizer but he did save that) but still no drinks.  At this point we have actually asked for our drinks. After the appetizer is gone and the drinks have long been empty our server informs us that one of our orders can not be filled.....ok at this point just give us the bill.  After waiting way too long for him to even come and let us pay for the drinks and the crappy appetizer we have to take our own bill up to the bartender to pay for it.... never again applebees. Never again.  If I could give this a negative star I would.  By the way, two drinks were 19.00, after all they did comp us the appetizer we almost wore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
7,Brad S.,"Irmo, SC",1,27,,1.0,2015-12-12,"This was the worst....the steak was so chewy and tasted like it was cooked on a dirty grill...I ordered it rare and it was raw....I should have known something was wrong when the waitress at the bar put my plate down and asked if I needed steak sauce....we also had salmon waaaay over cooked. Our waitress came over as we were  talking about how bad the food was,  she was like what's wrong...all weird. .panicked. ..I just laughed. ..all and said I'm not sure how it could be worse....she apologized and asked. ...wait for it. ...if I needed steak sauce...last time I'll eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
12,Matt A.,"Charleston, SC",0,13,,1.0,2016-02-26,Every table was dirty. It took 15 for us to get our drinks. They made made my order wrong. Bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
2,Marc P.,"Dunedin, FL",29,46,,2.0,2016-05-01,"The menu is so deceptive. Half the items do not have the price listed, the server had to ""look up the price"". Drinks terrible and over priced. Food fair. Stay away",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
6,Laura G.,"Arlington, VA",9,8,,1.0,2016-07-24,"Easily the worst customer service I've experienced in a long time. Went today around 1:45pm, so it wasn't packed at all. Took so long for someone to take our order, when they finally came over we ordered our food along with our drinks (two salads and water/coke). After waiting 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to bring us our drinks. Drank both our drinks, had to flag someone down again for refills, another 15 minutes. Ask to speak with manager about this, who wouldn't come over to our table before knowing what we wanted to discuss. When he finally came over he blamed the poor service on being struck by lightening conveniently within an hour of our order being placed. Finally got our salads arrived just over an hour later. Romain and grilled chicken- there's no reason it should have taken over an hour. By and far the worst service I've experienced in a long time. Don't waste your time at this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
4,Steve S.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,,1.0,2016-10-07,"Yep. I should have checked Yelp FIRST!! All floors have food from lunchtime on them. Took 25 minutes to get a burger. Bathrooms filthy. Employees have whatever attitude. If you want to see another Applebys on the way out, drop by here. Management should be embarrassed and quit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
3,Terry B.,"Wichita, KS",0,23,3.0,1.0,2016-11-23,"Sat down and the server didn't check back for 15 minutes.  However, the people that came in later were served in a reasonable amount of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
0,Rebekah P.,"Columbia, SC",0,58,1.0,4.0,2017-12-03,"I was very pleasantly surprised by our first visit to Applebees in probably 10 years. It started off a little rough: the atmosphere was hectic ($1 Long Island Ice Tea night.) and loud.  I'm not sure but I think the hostess called us ""dog"". Luckily, our waitress was excellent and friendly, anxious to please, and polite. And the dishes that we ordered were outstanding. My husband is still raving about his Bourbon Street  chicken and shrimp with roast potatoes. I had the BBQ Brisket Tacos with fries and cole slaw. It. was. to. die. for. So tasty and imaginative. The prices were good and the value was great. Any reservations I had about the ambiance were over-ridden with my first bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
1,Jennifer A.,"Charleston, SC",25,6,2.0,1.0,2017-12-03,This Applebee's is terrible. Service was super slow. Food came out cold and rock hard. Asked to speak with a manager that did absolutely nothing. Grilled cheese wasn't grilled. Steak quesadilla had nothing in it. Do not go to this Applebee's ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-17,,,,,
