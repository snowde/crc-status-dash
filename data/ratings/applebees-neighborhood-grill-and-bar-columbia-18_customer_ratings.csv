28,Billy B.,"Columbia, SC",0,6,,1.0,2012-01-29,"This Applebees is awful. I used to eat there often, but it has gone downhill so bad that I almost never go there anymore. Recently, I gave them one more chance and I will NOT go back. The service was terrible, we had to ask for silverware 5 times. They brought out a salad just before serving the meal, they brought 2of the 4 meals out before the others, and the 1st ones out were Luke warm at best..... And don't even get me started on the restrooms...... I had to take my 3 yr old to the bathroom and it was so filthy that I really didn't want her to even sit on the comode...... I will not ever return...... I have been in gas stations that have cleaner restrooms.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

26,Earl S.,"HOPKINS, SC",2,8,,2.0,2013-02-06,The best thing they serve are the drinks. If you consume enough alcohol the food will pass. If you want a good meal this place would be way down the list.

16,Liv S.,"Buford, GA",13,145,13.0,1.0,2013-03-29,"Restaurant: Tasteless burger, long wait time, overpriced food.  I asked the bartender (who was texting and serving no customers) where the restroom was.  He scoffed, sighed, pointed, shook his head, and went back to his phone. Server:  He was amazing.  Honestly, if I were him, I would have quit.  One person waiting an entire section and a half plus my table full of 14 people with no backup to be seen.  It was Army basic graduation day, the restaurant knew there would be big crowds.  We gave him a big tip. Conclusion:  One good server.  Although Applebee's aren't normally awesome, this was was particularly terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

23,Carl R.,"Columbia, SC",84,151,145.0,1.0,2013-07-01,"I wish I could give it no stars. We been going here for years. However, we stopped going about 4-5 years ago because of the bad service and long wait times for your food. However, we decided to give it another try. I have to say it was the worst managed restaurant I ever been in. We walked in during the evening, and there were 7 customers total in the restaurant. EVERY SINGLE TABLE that was empty had dirty dishes on it. I honestly, did not see one table that was cleaned off. There was no hostess, so we waited about 10 minutes for a manager to come from the kitchen and seat us. Our waiter was good. No complaints. He told us that there was no hostess and also no buss boys, so the waiters had to clean their own tables. Apprently, they only clean them when needed. The only people I saw there were the 2 waiters, bar tender and manager.  Also, that evening they were out of ice & sugar. It made for a lovely evening. As I was eating, I was watching people come in and wait to be seated. No one would acknowledge them, so they would leave. One couple came in and seated themselves. About 10-15 minutes later they were given menus. They started to complain among themselves/semi-loud that no one was taking their order. They left after wasting about 30-45 minutes. This place is very very poorly managed. After that night, I don't have the slightest intention to ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18?start=20,,,,,
17,Sam M.,"Shaw AFB, SC",36,1,1.0,1.0,2013-07-05,"Didn't care for the food. Drinks were watered down. Low manned, poorly managed. Venue was poorly kept.

22,Kent S.,"Fairfield, CA",61,25,,1.0,2013-11-06,Service was pretty bad. Food was uber salty. I think they add salt in the tap water as well. Terrible idea to eat there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18?start=20,,,,,
20,Karen S.,"Lexington, SC",79,225,,2.0,2013-12-08,"This review is solely based on the customer received at this location last night.  Mind you last night it was a major college football night and we were sitting by the bar.  Our server was speaking in an almost a whisper and one person in our party had to ask him to speak up.  I did not realize another person in our party had ordered an appetizer.  Ten minutes after we ordered we needed to ask our server to bring out the appetizer.  Not to thrilled in the ""container"" that pop was in to refill my drinks - the ""few"" times that our server to refill beverages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18?start=20,,,,,
9,Rachel O.,"Columbia, SC",208,207,924.0,2.0,2014-01-15,"When someone gives you a gift you should always say thank you and appreciate that the giver was kind enough to think of you.  It's the southern way, right?  So off Boyfriend and I go with our Applebee's gift card.  It was a long day and we were tired and we forgot to get something from the store so we decided that was the perfect night to use the card.  We decided to get the 2 for $20 deal.  We ordered the wings as our appetizer.  They were fine. Not crispy at all and smothered in sauce (we picked honey bbq) but edible.  I got the 3 cheese chicken penne pasta. The pasta was overcooked and it was very light on the chicken and cheese. It didn't have any flavor so I added salt and pepper (which I almost never add to food) and it was again... edible, but I didn't finish it. The breadstick?  So dry! Boyfriend picked the chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were the tastiest thing we had all night. They were crisp and well seasoned.  We also ordered the little shot desserts -one oreo and one hot fudge.  I wouldn't get them again. They were clearly pre-made and hanging out in a very cold fridge all day or a number of days.  The service was also slow and we often had to wait and then give a polite little wave to our waitress to catch her attention.  I had to ask for silverware and plates for our appetizer.  They didn't clear our table the whole time we were there so the plates just piled up.  The atmosphere was also loud and there were several groups of teenage or early twenty somethings making a TON of noise.   We would never choose to go here and if another gift card comes our way for Applebee's we will be driving farther to try a different location.  Proceed with caution... and maybe ear plugs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18,,,,,
27,Kylee H.,"Columbia, SC",6,4,,2.0,2014-01-23,"The two stars I am giving this particular Applebee's is for the food, and only the food. I have been here 3 times, and each time, I have had drinks and food at the bar. The first time, it was an experience I would consider ""not bad"". The bartender was friendly enough that I didn't feel like I was bothering her, but that's about it. As someone who worked for Applebee's as a server and bartender for 7 years, I may be a little biased, but I'm just asking for good food, a good drink, all served to me in a timely manner, and to not feel like I'm asking for a kidney donation when I order something. The last straw was the 3rd time. We were barely addressed by any employee there, our appetizer came after the food, they sell Long Island ice teas at a top shelf price, while using a well quality, pre-mixed alcohol and way too much sour mix. By the time we left, I felt completely disrespected, and pretty much insulted by the lack of service and concern for all of their guests. Unless of course they know you, then they will take excellent care of you, while ignoring all their other guests. Will NOT return to this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18?start=20,,,,,

14,Dale C.,"Columbia, SC",25,121,14.0,4.0,2015-06-28,We saw their commercials and decided to stop in.  Hadn't been there in several years but will go back.  We got several appetizers on their mix and match platter.  All were great.  The pretzel and fried green beans were great.  The sweet and spicy pickles were very flavorful.  Good kick.  The siracha shrimp were not too spicy.  Our least favorite was the double crisp wings were not crisp and covered on sauce.  Our waiter was great.  He brought our food and drinks quickly and kept stopping by to check on is.  Atmosphere was a little loud but overall not bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18,,,,,

He said ""what, you don't enjoy that"" and then went to table of people and told them we didn't like the singing which was embarrassing when the whole table looked over at us.

And wouldn't you know it, the same -1 star rating service as before. It's like a black hole of rude and incompetent people.  We walked in just to take a to go order. We spoke with the woman who was in charge of to go orders and she began taking our order. We barely began our order when she decided that the phone was more more important like if God himself was about to call. She began taking the order from the person on the phone, who seemed to be asking questions about every item on the menu, and completely ignored our order. Really??!! It wasn't even busy.

They gave us a $30 manager card for our issue. So we have them another chance Sunday and what do you know same awful service, bland food, dirty dishes, and water down drinks.

5,Jennifer A.,"Charleston, SC",25,6,2.0,1.0,2017-05-07,The staff and service at this Applebee's is horrible. The hostess did not smile once when seating us. Our waitress was sweet but did not know what she was doing. One of the staff members was sitting at the bar being loud and obnoxious with a coworker. The manager was a witness to all this and didn't say or do anything. The manager was sitting at a table just having a great time with some woman while the staff was hanging around his table. At one point the hostess walked thru the dining room while scrolling thru her phone and then ended up in the side section sitting at a table on her phone. I am a manager at food service establishment and the behavior of the staff was extremely inappropriate and unwelcoming. I will never go to this Applebee's again.

2,Steve B.,"Columbia, SC",86,2,,1.0,2017-12-08,"I've been there twice now and the hostess is essentially clueless about how to seat someone. With approximately ten open tables she struggled to figure out how to seat any party while the line extended out the door. The food was acceptable the first time, but not great. The second time, the food was miraculously cold even though it was served on a sizzling plate. A couple minutes on the plate and the food was warmer at least enough to deal with it. The service was horrendous both times though. Getting a refill or putting in an order took at least ten minutes every time or we were just forgotten until we asked the bar next to us to help out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
0,Austina W.,"Columbia, SC",118,49,62.0,4.0,2017-12-09,"I've been to this Applebee's a few times. My experiences are different based on the time of day I go so I'll give a little review of both.  Night: Overall, my experiences at night have gone very well (I like the happy hour boneless wings). The service is typically quick and friendly and wait times are about on par with what you'd expect for the amount of business they have. Food is always hot and well presented. Management usually always asks how our meal was. Good experience.  Day: Daytime tends to be much slower (to the point that I've resolved not to come here when I have to get back to work in an hour). Food is usually good, but often not quite as hot when it hits the table.  The restaurant: I like the set up of the new Applebee's. The bar sitting is nice for games and booths are comfortable. It's usually clean. What is not clean is the bathroom. This restroom is outdated. The toilet runs. It's not very clean.  Overall the experience is good, but I'd recommend not going on your lunch break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-18,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
1,Tara B.,"Columbia, SC",38,245,148.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"If it was not for the waiter, I would give them 0 stars, but Yelp won't allow it. This is my first time at this location. I saw the Yelp reviews that caused me pause. Customers beware! Do not expect much to go right on Devine Street Applebee's. Let's start with: 1) Hostess: she did not seem too excited. The crowd was slim, so I don't understand why we waited 3 minutes to be greeted. 2) Waiter: he was good, but the wait for the food to come out took about 15 minutes. When my riblets came out, they were hard and cold. I requested new ribs and took another 10 minutes. The restaurant was not crowded, so I plead the 5th... 3) Food quality and restaurant appearance: seriously, Applebee's quality has diminished over the years. I grew up on Applebee's as a kid and college student and cherished it, but boy, I'm struggling! It's not the same. In conclusion, I doubt I will be coming back to this specific location.
