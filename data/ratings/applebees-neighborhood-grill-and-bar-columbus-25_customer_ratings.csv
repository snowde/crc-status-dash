The staff is awesome, the people who frequent this location are awesome, and conveniently located right off the interstate. Always a great time here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-25,,,,,
1,Rick B.,"Houston, TX",85,7,,1.0,2016-09-29,"Let me start by saying Applebee's suck a huge c@$k  I have not gone in over 2 years because it was bad then. but my daughter is a teen and has never been so I reluctantly agreed to eat there. Portions are small and prices are way higher than they should be, even for a cookie cutter franchise. That aside if I order something it should at least be close to the description on the menu ( a Philly is grilled steak not boiled Or microwaved chuck roast) and if you have a picture in the menu and a customer says I want it exactly like that it should not look like a plate you took off the table that just walked out. And the drink prices have got be the only thing keeping you open. ( 4.99 for an 18oz draft?) Hello bars on Broadway aren't charging that much. Needless to say tonight was the last time I will ever eat at Applebee's and I'm sure since my daughters experienced it for herself it will be the last place her and the rest of her frien will go to eat. Ps Applebee's they will be 21 soon. Dumbasses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-25,,,,,
0,Whitley A.,"Columbus, GA",86,8,3.0,4.0,2017-11-26,"We came in to avoid the late night fast food and were not disappointed. Our server Stephanie was very attentive and super nice. She made sure our glasses were always full and assured we were without need. Now, the only reason for the four stars was because of the food. It was pretty tasty but honestly could have been a bit better. The appetizer was great but our pastas were a bit bland and short on the serving size. However, the overall experience was pleasant and we most likely will return soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-25,,,,,
