10,Mike A.,"Columbus, NE",3,12,,2.0,2012-12-25,Went way down hill in the past few years,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
8,Tanner H.,"Lincoln, NE",64,26,7.0,1.0,2013-08-13,"I hate to give one star reviews, but when a table of food comes out differently than ordered and when I have to teach a bartender that a cheap shot of tequila is generally served with a lime and salt - something is wrong. Poorly run and with little remorse. I don't know if there's better options in Columbus, but I would sure hope so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
9,ZombieFern G.,"Broomfield, CO",5,4,1.0,5.0,2014-11-25,Great place to Eat. They make you feel comfortable and Service is 4 stars. Bartender Alison and Manager Yecia are two Amazing Girls.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
4,Trevor B.,"Norfolk, NE",0,7,,2.0,2015-07-12,"Steak was not medium rare like I ordered. My girlfriends chicken wrap looked super dry. They took forever to get our nachos, the waitress was honest and said the cook burnt them twice and had to make them for a third time. HTF do you burn nachos?? Lol, the waitress was great, she seemed frustrated with the way things are operating. We have a Applebee's in Norfolk which is a lot better, chefs at this one have a lot to learn. Shoulda just skipped this place, not worth $40.00 for just two people. Once again, very nice wait staff; just shitty food. Obvious management problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
7,Jed And Melissa S.,"Omaha, NE",1,19,3.0,2.0,2015-07-29,We have been here several times in the passed year. Only once was the experience good. The service is pretty mediocre and the food is good only on certain nights. Found a hair in my food last time I was at this restaurant. The wait staff at this location seem to be to worried about socializing with each other. They usually forget to check on their customers drinks. Could be such a better place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
0,Jeremy W.,"Village of Clarkston, MI",12,9,9.0,4.0,2016-01-12,It's an Applebee's so don't expect high end food or service . This place had good service and decent food. I would eat here if i came back to Columbus again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
2,Eileen V.,"Nashville, TN",21,3,,2.0,2016-03-05,"Waitress was very nice but extremely forgetful   and apologetic. She kept asking if ""we"" we're ready to order.  It took a very very long time to get our order. They had to cook my brothers steak 3 times and it still was not right.  We asked for another glass of water that took 5 minutes to obtain as the waitress was busy singing happy birthday. Then she was visiting with another table. She finally remembered our water.  Won't be going back for a really long time.  It's not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
6,Jeff H.,"Columbus, NE",0,5,,1.0,2016-04-28,"Slow food prep three times in a row. Waitresses are nice, but piercings must be a prerequisite to work there. Try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
5,Nurik M.,"Lincolnshire, IL",103,3,,1.0,2016-05-15,We came with a group of 9. They made us wait for  30 minutes and seated us in a place which was open all that time. Slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
1,Nina B.,"Columbus, NE",36,9,,1.0,2017-02-08,"Tried eating here for the 1st time in 2 years because of a very bad experience and tonight they remind us why we stopped eating there in the first place. I ordered the sirloin with shrimp and parmesan, baked potato and 4 cheese Mac and cheese. Sounds amazing don't you think? Ya ,well, if it was hot it would have been. I think.  It came out cold. So I sent it back. They actually microwaved it and brought it back. Still cold my cheese was not even melted. Potato still too cold to melt butter.  I eat my steaks medium rare so I figured by the time they got done microwaving it it would be dry as dirt. Well I was right I'm assuming . The 2nd time they took it back "" they made it all fresh"" the steak was super dry not sure if they gave me a new steak or just re-grilled my old one. My husband got the mac and cheese with chicken and it was cold too he just didn't send it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
3,Anthony H.,"Santaquin, UT",0,1,,4.0,2017-06-12,The service was great and the food was good. The waitress was exceptional- very nice and took very good care of you. Very impressed by the service. And the food was standard for an Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-27,,,,,
