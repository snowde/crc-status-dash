12,Andres P.,"Columbus AFB, MS",24,10,1.0,1.0,2013-09-14,Worst service ever. The food wasn't any better. My side of veggies came in the bag that it was steamed in. I haven't been back since.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
10,Paige H.,"Vernon, AL",0,1,,2.0,2014-06-29,The service was bad and the food was cold. I usually enjoy eating Applebee's but today was awful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
9,Tom F.,"Columbus, MS",0,12,,5.0,2015-12-24,"Always good service, but not exceptional.  Food is always great and nicely presented.   Good value at lunch and quick.   Try the Fiesta chicken. Love the bourbon street chicken and shrimp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
11,Kelley B.,"Portland, OR",0,40,4.0,2.0,2016-03-12,"Worst. Service. Ever.  Applebee's wasn't my first choice, but given the time (it was 11ish), we didn't have many options for a full menu.  We were seated right away - hostess was friendly.  Our server was so distracted by the other tables that we were continuously overlooked.  Told two of the items we ordered were no longer available, we asked for menus to find something else.  First red flag - if you're going back to a table to tell them you're out of the items they ordered, perhaps taking a menu at the same time is a good idea.  Anyway, once we had the menus, she disappeared for 20 minutes.  In the meantime, the third person in our party received their meal.  She was almost done with her dinner before we were able to order something that was available.  She had the Triple Hog Dare Ya - the sandwich was good - would recommend it - the fries were cold and just decided to live with it.  The quesadilla - well let's just say it was disappointing.  It took over an hour to get two waters - we already had beer so at least we did have SOMETHING to drink.  Ordered Apple Chimicheesecake (it was good!) dessert and coffee - dessert arrived, as did our bill - no coffee.  By this time it was pushing 1a so decided to just let it slide.  They get two starts only because two of the five items we ordered were good, the rest of the experience was not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
8,Kimberlea L.,"Columbus, MS",44,4,3.0,1.0,2016-03-14,Had poor service the first time we tried it a couple months ago. We decided to give it another try last night. We had no server until the manager came over and got our drink order. After 45 minutes we had no appetizer. We walked out. I do have to say the manager tried hard but it was horrible service and not worth our hard earned money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
7,Debra M.,"West Point, MS",0,4,,3.0,2016-03-25,"We really enjoyed the food and the service was very good. We didn't have a long, food was not hot ok but could have been better. The front door entry way is very dirty all the glass is kind of nasty inside and out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
5,Caroline C.,"Eight Mile, AL",66,12,,2.0,2016-05-20,"Was in town visiting for a graduation and was told there was a 30 minute wait because they only had 3 servers. Once we got our table our service was okay but nothing spectacular. The server rarely checked to see if we needed more drinks and the food portions are subpar compared to my hometown's Applebee's (Mobile, AL). If I come to visit again, I will not be dining at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
2,Jacob T.,"Estacada, OR",3,6,,1.0,2016-05-29,"No one goes to applebees because of their mixologists... or lack thereof, regardless, while ordering some takeout i decided to order a simple vodka martini at the bar. I was delivered a martini glass, yes, but what was inside was far from anything resembling a cocktail. It was green. Yes. Green. Apparently applebees bartenders are taught to use as little alcohol as possible, and when it comes to a vodka martini, that means they pour olive juice into a glass and add a splash of vodka. I returned to drink and asked them to make me a ""vodka martini. vodka, with just a splash of olive juice and vermouth"". Perhaps the bartender was confused at what to do with a situation in which she would actually have to put alcohol in my insanely overpriced drink, so instead she elected to make me a vermouth martini with a splash of vodka and olive juice. Inconceivable.  When it comes to a drink as simple as the classic vodka martini, bartenders of all experience levels should be able to produce a drinkable product. I don't expect much from columbus ms. but come on applebees. get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
4,Kim H.,"Gardendale, AL",3,15,,5.0,2016-09-03,"Went to this location in spite of the reviews. It was great. Very friendly, attentive waitress. We ordered half price appetizers and a two for $20 selection. All the food was delicious. So glad we gave it a chance!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,

1,Michael W.,"Columbus, MS",0,4,,4.0,2017-12-14,"I went for lunch and it was good. I am writing this review considering it for what it is, a chain steakhouse. We ordered a small sirloin and the chicken Caesar salad. Dressing came on the side like i asked. Friendly and quick service. Food was good. Will go again. Recommend that they get some more varieties of hot sauce other than just Tabasco.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
0,Zakia D.,"Carrollton, GA",7,23,,3.0,2018-01-05,"I visited this location while vising my ill grandfather. I was joined with my boyfriend and youngest cousin. We were sat immediately however the hostess seemed to not want to be there. But she sat us without menus or table set-up. About five minutes later, our waitress came and she went to get everything before placing drink orders. Her name was Jacqueline and she was able to entertain my cousin and his mouth.  Her service was decent, we usually give generous tips considering my background serving. We usually order off the 2 for $20 because I am such a picky eater. We had the Three Cheese Captappi, two orders of the   Chicken tender platters with broccoli and baked potatoes, and a 6oz. with the  same sides. Okay, the steak was over cooked, meaning it was dry and damn near burnt. She alerted the manager would apologized and handled the issue instantly. He offered us a Free dessert, which we took home. Other than the steak, we didn't have a terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-33,,,,,
