15,Marc R.,"Concord, NC",10,43,36.0,4.0,2012-07-08,Bar staff are great and food is good. What I really like is they host Saturday pancake breakfasts  to support local  groups like bands and scouts who serve the food. Nice to see a national chain act local.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
14,J R.,"Concord, NC",0,17,,1.0,2013-12-18,"So, based on my prior review, the district manager sent me a few complimentary meal vouchers.  I was hesitant to even go back . . . and I shouldn't have.  I got a cheddar, bacon burger that was so full of grissle and bone that I nearly pucked on the second bite.  I ordered a steak for my mother.  It was smothered with  . . . oh heck, I don't know . . but it tasted awful.  The steak was ordered medium, received well done, but did have good taste.  Sadly, and 85 year old woman couldn't chew the well done lump of a steak.  The chips and dip were as nasty as before.  The oil is old and tastes rancid.  The only good part of the meal was the dessert.  The brownie and ice cream were delicious, and about the only decent part of a $40 meal.  I'll never go there again, comp or no comp.  Not good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
12,Fast F.,"Concord, NC",0,36,,3.0,2015-01-03,"Not much to say. Like every other Applebee's across the usa. I am assuming that's the way it's planned; so all is consistant from one to the next. I've been brought there twice and certainly wouldn't go of my own accord. But, if you know what Applebee's is like in your town, this one is exactly like it, so at least you know what you're going to get. Hey, works for Mcbag!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
13,Alyson D.,"Concord, NC",0,19,,5.0,2015-08-08,"I just came by to compare the ratings to O'Charley's because I just left there feeling disappointed and annoyed with myself for trying there again and I'm shocked this place has a lower rating.  I have never had a bad experience here in the 20+ times going.  The food is always delicious, the bartenders are delightful and the server Ron/Ronnie is just a great young man!  I would choose Applebee's over O'Charley's or Chili's any day!  They are easier to pull in and out of for one!  Honestly though, this place always impresses me, I'm never left regretting my decision to come here.  I wish they had outdoor seating but that is honestly the only drawback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
7,Kristina H.,"Concord, NC",20,62,64.0,4.0,2015-12-06,"I went into this location for Veterans Day and was not disappointed. The service was great and the waitstaff was professional. The Veterans Day menu was good, but as a vegetarian obviously I had to special order the chicken penne so that it wouldn't Include chicken, no problem no questions asked came out great. Nice ambience, great food and great prices, nice for a quick bite to eat for lunch. Will be going back for lunch one day for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
9,J F.,"Landis, NC",1,75,37.0,3.0,2016-02-22,"Concord- Went to this location of Applebee's for lunch yesterday. As other reviewers have noted, once you've been the one Applebee's, you pretty much been to all of them. This franchise's consistency is to be recognized.  We decided to take advantage of the 2 for $20 entree special with a appetizer included. The mozzarella sticks were among the best I believe I've ever enjoyed. Great job on those. The All American Burger I had also was fine, however not as outstanding as the appetizer was.  The only critique I can offer on this visit is in regards to our server. Her performance was adequate, however one thing was a distraction from the meal. Perhaps it is a prejudice of my being older than the Millenial generation, but a heavily tattooed woman does not project an image of which I would want as a server in my restaurant. Just a personal observation, may be totally ignored by many these days. To summarize, it's an Applebees meal which met the expectation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
11,Mynee F.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",11,11,1.0,3.0,2016-02-23,"Service was EXCELLENT even servers that weren't ours helped and didn't seem bothered by questions they interacted with my baby, management was GREAT as well. Unfortunately food quality is poor and Applebee's was my favorite restaurant in college. Had to get my steak cooked twice and it still came out bad it was however cooked to the right temperature the 3rd time around but the quality of beef YUCK I couldn't take more then two bites I literally threw up as soon as I got to the parking lot (SORRY to whoever had to clean that up) well at least I had a great margarita and Caesar salad even if I never got a chance to digest it. I'd still go back for a drink at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
10,John M.,"Concord, NC",0,4,,1.0,2016-05-06,We don't come here very often but this review is due to the second time in a row that our service has been aweful. We walked after 15 minutes of no drink order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
8,Wes S.,"Concord, NC",0,8,1.0,1.0,2016-07-06,"Love the Applebee's menu, absolutely hate that they can't seat a group of more than 6, other than in the bar area, right under a speaker that was playing music that was way too loud and obviously more for the wait and cook staff. Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Waiter actually had the nerve to lie to my face and tell me that the music couldn't be lowered any more than it already was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
5,Teaha C.,"Harrisburg, NC",0,5,9.0,1.0,2016-12-30,This restaurant has the worst customer service ever for the restaurant that I have ordered full rack  of ribs! They was cold when they arrive at my table,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
4,Andrew J.,"Concord, NC",0,11,,1.0,2017-05-16,"Worst. Applebee's. Ever.  The food tasted terrible, it was microwaved and lukewarm.  The vegetables were drowned in butter and was still horrible.  I called for a refund and the general manager was not surprised at all.  I had no idea that a chain restaurant could fail to deliver on every component of a meal.  Literally, every other restaurant in the area is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
2,Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360.0,3.0,2017-05-19,"Not my favorite restaurant but it's what my nephew wanted. Some old food but the pasta I had was.flavorful and well prepared .

6,Terry B.,"Salisbury, NC",0,5,,2.0,2017-06-14,Brownish lettuce NOT appealing especially in their relatively expensive Oriental Salad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
3,Kevin M.,"Concord, NC",21,16,,1.0,2017-07-28,They have these ridiculous I pad things at the tables that your kids can inadvertently add charges to your bill by pulling up games. Not to mention we go to dinner for family time not video game time. Whoever thought this idea up was a total moron.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
0,Rusty J.,"Concord, NC",11,101,59.0,3.0,2017-12-07,I went in with sorta low expectations.  I can't say that anything was bad but I also can't say that anything was amazingly great.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It was decent.  I got a half-rack of baby back ribs as my meal.  They were decent.  The service was okay.  The place looked clean enough.  The price was fair.  The atmosphere was slightly loud.   No real complaints.  The best takeaway from the night was the spinach dip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
1,Donna F.,"Concord, NC",0,12,,2.0,2018-01-06,"We went to A's for their ""all you can eat"" riblets and chicken strips. Three adults, one toddler. Service was very slow and the busy time had not started. A half hour passed before our server appeared and took our orders. Nice enough server, but disappeared readily. I didn't actually time how long it took to get our meals, but it certainly was a long time. Food was average, cole slaw was in a tiny cup and was very soggy. We put in a refill request. It took so long that one of the adults took their child and left. A food runner finally appeared with our meals. The plates were very hot and the riblets were dry. Perhaps too long under the warming lights? Now there were three orders. Two were on plates. The third was on a kitchen metal sheet pan which the runner tried to hide behind the two plates. The plate that had the chicken strips had 6 pieces. The sheet pan had three. We asked for to go boxes and left. Usually I would have asked for the manager, but I feared I would be there for another hour. Someone should explain to the kitchen that quicker the food comes out, the quicker tables are turned over. Will never recommend A's to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-concord-8,,,,,
