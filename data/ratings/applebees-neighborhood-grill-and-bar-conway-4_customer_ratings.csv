11,Shelley M.,"Asheville, NC",24,1,,1.0,2014-06-08,"Nasty! Bartender bitched about how bad he hates his job. Manager Rick, berated an older waitress so everyone could hear on the floor. Restrooms are disgusting, better luck stopping at a c store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
12,Keith T.,"Conway, SC",1,1,,2.0,2014-07-16,Food looked nothing like it did on the menu. Got a steak and it was the size of a candy bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
0,Anthony G.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",10,31,34.0,3.0,2014-07-20,"Came in for a light lunch while on vacation. I was excited to see that they still offer the Butter Pecan Blondie - the last time I was at an Applebee's in NYC, that location had discontinued it and I was very excited to see it available here. So I decided to order the appetizer sampler as my meal so I could save room for dessert. The sampler was nice, not great, but nice overall.  It was a good choice for that purpose. Then I order the Blondie. To my extreme disappointment, they were out of the Blondie brownies. The waitress was very eager to find another option that could take the place of the Blondie. So. Epically. Disappointed.  The Blondie gods have cursed me to never enjoy their delightful goodness ever again.  #imgoingtoDairyQueen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
6,C T.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",10,159,134.0,1.0,2014-12-07,"6:00 on a Sunday night, not packed but not empty either. We were seated immediately but then weren't acknowledged by a soul until we got up and left after 10 minutes.  Maybe next time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
8,J C.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,8,1.0,1.0,2015-04-12,"Came here tonight with family. First waitress brought over drinks and put straws in them with her bare hands. All silverware were dirty. I ordered nachos verde, they were very dry and barely anything on them. Would mot reccomend this restaurant to anyone. Not worth the money or your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
7,Tina M.,"Conway, SC",1,1,,1.0,2015-09-27,We ordered food for pick up last week.  My husband's rib order was great!  I ordered 2  appetizers of chicken wanton tacos and chicken tortilla soup and my husband ordered 1 appetizer of hot bone in chicken wings.  When he got home with the food we did not get the chicken wontons and the soup had the tortilla strips mixed in the soup and it was mushy and nasty.  I called them up and they gave us 3 free appetizers for our next trip which was today. We did take out again.  Everything was good except I ordered french onion soup and the Swiss cheese was not cooked.  They just threw it on top...We won't be visiting this location again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
9,Timothy M.,"North Augusta, SC",1,3,2.0,5.0,2015-12-24,Jackie the waitress and the manager (young man) were excellent!!!! I'd return to this Applebee's just because of the customer service. The food was good as well. Food came out fast. Great job!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
10,Richard M.,"Pawleys Island, SC",0,7,,2.0,2016-04-03,Should have checked this out first. Sorry I came here. Cold soup! Waiting a long time for a featured item. Food was decent once it arrived. Staff just doesn't proceed efficiently.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
4,Busa1361 ..,"Conway, SC",10,11,,5.0,2016-11-27,My wife and I don't understand all the bad reviews. The staff was friendly and the food was good. We will eat here again in the future. Maybe people just get off on leaving bad reviews.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
5,Thomas L.,"Little River, SC",12,13,,1.0,2017-01-28,Got food poisoning here and had to miss a week of school!! Stay away from this location. I love Applebee's but this experience has scarred me in dealing with their brand. If you go to Applebee's in general then I recommend the quesadilla burger and the boneless mild wings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
3,Patrick W.,"Shirley, NY",461,9,,3.0,2017-06-29,Immediately know I won't return because of the disgusting ability for people to smoke in your restaurant. Being in the industry myself that is the opposite of hospitality. That being said my steak was disgusting and the green beans were equally unimpressive. The only saving grace was your nice server and a decent mojito.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
2,Phillip R.,"Loris, SC",0,4,5.0,1.0,2017-10-01,"So Applebee's always has great food with good atmospheres, but last night this one in Conway was horrible. It was terribly cold and when I looked up to see if I was sitting under a vent, I see many of the vents with dust on them along with several tiles that appeared to have water damage. My server was slow as hell. Then another server assisted her and forgot about my to-go tray. Had to get that from the hostess. This was by far my worst experience ever at this establishment and I have been here many time since it opened. It took me 10 minutes to unthae after leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
1,Andy S.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",33,3,,1.0,2017-11-26,The service was the worst ever the surver kept walking passed us. Never asked if we wanted any refills on our drinks and I asked for a rare steak and got a well done steak and it took a long time and got charged twice for the steak. Very disappointed with this place..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conway-4,,,,,
