9,JodyLynn G.,"Covington, GA",0,2,,1.0,2014-11-11,"Well, it was a bit sad to start off what should be a day of thanks to our veterans. I took my grandparents out to lunch at our local Applebee's, and was saddened by the lack of customer service. The only person who had any pep whatsoever was the hostess. Now before anyone tells me that ""I just don't get it"", let me say that I am a new manager at a bar in Tucker with less than great reviews. But given that this is a corporate operated store, you would think the training would be far greater. My staff has way more pep. And that speaks volumes. In addition to the poor customer service, we had no silverware, no napkins, the salad that came out was a small handful of lettuce with tiny bits of burnt chicken that they charged 9.99 for, and we are still waiting on sauce for the shrimp...check please?!? This whole place needs some serious training--including management. I will volunteer my time and energy to do ""customer service bootcamp"" with them, just say the word!

3,Purple L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,53,118.0,1.0,2015-08-19,"I was a Applebee's fan until I came here. So very sad, bcuz my little one and I used to love this chain. We've eaten at soooooo many from California to  this place. However, I can't place the full blame upon the serve I received. Simply because I had this nagging feeling to leave as soon as I walked in. Why? There were only a handful of patrons but hella staff members standing around. However, the greeter took her sweet azz time approaching us to even seat us. She was kinda standoffish and I got the feeling she didn't want to or perhaps this wasn't her job. However, she seated us with menus and placed a drink napkin upon the table. And, without any words she smoove walked off.  Now you know the amount of time you take looking over the menu, make small talk, and begin to turn your head in several different directions looking for your server or atleast a glass of water...Nothing! Once again, I should have left then. However, we had decided on our items. I notice other servers moving past us, bringing food and whatnot. But, no one stops at our table, UNTIL, I hear the lady that seated us loudly proclaim to another server ""I only have one body and two hands"". Damn, we should've left then.  The server that was spoken to like that came over to our table, and introduced herself and asked if we had placed our drink orders. I reckon the look upon my face spoke before my mouth moved. Because, she quickly explained that this was her section. However, because drink napkins were placed upon the table that signaled between the servers that this table was being serviced by some other server. NOPE! Not at all honey. She mumbled under her breath in regards to the other server; personal issuses perhaps. NOT MY BUSINESS.  We completed our full order. Simple two meals from the Kid's Menu. Must've been a bad day for the cook because something was off. The food ordered exactly as is on the menu WAS NOT the same quality we have received across the good old USA. I returned a 4oz steak due to 2 1/2oz being completely burnt. The garlic mash potatoes taste as if they were nothing more than powder mix with too much water. I thought I left the water induced food back in my military days. Shrugs! The chicken mac and cheese was....oh hell, it was EWWWWW!!! The overall  service was poor, although our server tired. Closing, this used to be my 10 years old favorite spot until he said, ""Mom, we don't have to come back here again do we?""

Five minutes later I'm told they don't have it that night (WTF?). Revert to two appetizers: fried cheese sticks and an order of their new meatballs. Cheesesticks were obviously of the frozen (cardboard flavor) variety. The meatballs, well, the first one I cut into was cold and raw on the inside.

6,Leann W.,"Conyers, GA",0,5,2.0,1.0,2016-06-01,"I used to love this Applebee's when it first opening in Conyers. For the past two years the service has went down hill bad. The food is still good but when you can't get service why eat there? Twice last week I tried to go for lunch to give them another try. There was a 30 minute wait for a table on Tuesday and Friday there was a 5-10 minute wait. So I am on my lunch break as is most of Conyers, we do not have time to wait. There were plenty of tables open but not enough servers. So on Friday we decided to wait 5-10 minutes, ended up being more like 30 minutes still waiting. I saw 5-6 tables clear out while we were there but still did not get seated. I asked the greeter what the problem was and she said management said she could not seat anyone yet. I swear there was less than 25 people eating in there at 12:30 (peak lunch time). That is just horrible in this area. We left and went to O'Charley's, had no wait, ate and got out of there in 45 minutes. I have tried and tried with this Applebee's for years but their service is the worst in Conyers, GA.

My husband and I visited Conyers, GA Applebee's last night, 9/19/2016 basically to take advantage of Burger night. We had a couple of coupons that were told that we couldn't use because of the specials ordered.  However, our server Janee  tells us that we can't use the coupon according to the manager. However,  she brought the appetizer to us anyway. I reminded her about the coupon, and why did she bring the wings? She stated, ""I had already put in the order."" To which I replied, ""Am I supposed to pay for them?"" She removed them, and took off the bill, but lied to the manager that I just didn't want them. I even asked if I could use my birthday coupon of a free dessert, and again, the answer was ""no""! Oh well, so much for the birthday club! Fast forward to paying my bill. When the server "" just happened"" to walk by our table,  I asked for the bill. She encouraged me to just use the table kiosk for paying the tab, which I did. However,  while waiting for my receipt, the manager, Sam walks over to tell me that I hadn't paid my tab. After I tried to convince him that I had, he publicly argues with me that I had not since he didn't have a receipt!! Why would Applebee's have the kiosk if it won't print a customer's receipt from the machine immediately as Chili's does? It certainly would have eliminated the confusion had it worked properly. Sam basically called me a liar about $10.69! I'm not rich, but I don't have to argue about or steal $10.00 worth of food!! To shut him up because it was his word against mine, since I had no receipt, I paid my bill AGAIN!! This time, $15.00 plus change.  When I checked my account, I had been charged TWICE!!!! I immediately went back to Conyers Applebee's to speak to Sam, but he wasn't in. So, I spoke to TJ, the young woman on duty who took the information, and promised to file a report to get my money refunded.  As I was walking out, Sam came on duty and I spoke to him about the way he treated me the night before, and how he accused me of lying, which he denied.  When I got in my car, I phoned the area supervisor, Shawn Ledford,  who I am awaiting a return phone call. Needless to say, I won't ever need to use the coupon because I won't ever dine at Conyers Applebee's or maybe, any other. I gave 1 star because the burger was tasty, but the dining experience was horrible!!! Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conyers-3,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48

That was the 1st red flag. We should have left. It took over 20 minutes for our chips and salsa to make it's way to our table. My question is who's in the kitchen? And why so long for chips & salsa? So the chips were both cold and stale. Yes. Both. Usually I don't do this but I sent it back. There's no way I'm paying for stale food. WTF?! Now for the icing on the cake... The drinks show up maybe 10 minutes after we send the chips & salsa back. We ordered margaritas. THE DRINKS WERE WATERED DOWN! We sent everything back. It was as if I was being tested. I gathered my party of 4 and we exited this poor excuse for a restaurant in Conyers, Ga. we then went up the road to Chilli's and they hit everything spot on.

23,Shan R.,"Conyers, GA",6,4,,1.0,2017-05-05,"Today is May 5, 2017 Walking in I thought that me and my family would get a good experience but I was wrong.... I ordered only to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes on cold food. On top on that I called for a manager twice and No one came... But the manager walked pass twice..... Once I called her again the lady standing behind us was a manager.  She then proceeded to take things off for convenience but charged me for my son's food ( Keep in mind it was cold ). Keep in mind we did not eat anything.  This place needs New Management or someone who understands the hospitality industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-conyers-3,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
