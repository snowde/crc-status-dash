They don't seem to buy their food locally, it rarely tastes fresh.  Last time I was there, I had one of the 600 calorie dishes - Lime chicken fiasco...er, fiesta?  It tasted like a frozen Jenny Craig dish from the microwave, and for $10.

Good thing I ordered it med-well because it came out Med.  From other reviews it seems that they tend to under cook the steaks.  FOr a place that is not a steak house I would err on the side of having the meat cooked therefore order it a grade more done than normal. The veggies were quick steamed so just fyi if you like your veggies soft they are not.

It was a bit awkward because we were not separate from the rest of the restaurant, but the servers did great. The girls (U15 vball club) moved around quite a bit so they often brought food out to a table that no longer had the people who ordered it sitting at it. They were all great sports and I hope they all got tipped well.  The food came out quickly considering how busy they were and everyone left happy.  We will definitely think of them before the Rock from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

1,Ko T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",52,152,496.0,3.0,2013-01-27,"FOOD AND DRINK Ordered Bourbon black and bleu burger with mayo and no pink; and raspberry iced tea. Burger was perfectly cooked (see my photo). Fries were seasoned just right.  My iced tea was so-so. I wish they would add a little bit more raspberry syrup or whatever they use to flavor the iced tea. SERVICE My waitress was friendly, but she tends to enjoy talking to her coworkers more than to check on her customers. After she delivered my food, she never came back to check on my food or my drink. I would have understood if she was busy with other customers, but there were not a lot of customers. She was chatting with her coworkers and helping them roll utensils in napkins on the other side of the bar area. Meanwhile, here I was having to eat and finish my burger with an empty drink. Not cool! When she finally came to my table (after I was done eating several minutes later), she did offer and got me a refill. It would have been better if I had my refill while I was eating and not afterwards. MISC Free wifi. In the bar area, the tables on the left side has access to power outlets. I thought that was a good idea. CONCLUSION I gave three stars for food, free wifi and available power outlets. I took away two stars for the lack of service and not so good raspberry iced tea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

She did not make any suggestion or ask us if it would be enough.  The waitress comes to our table caring two plates in two separate hands and places them in front of each of us.

I ordered one of their Caribbean drinks and I feel like I paid almost $10.00 for nothing more than fruit punch. I won't buy a mixed drink there again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
27,Randall J.,"Bellevue, WA",5,98,25.0,4.0,2017-06-08,I eat lunch here now and then. The service is always good and the food consistent. I have no problem recommending this restaurant for American food.  I enjoy the Southwest Steak salad.   If you do not like chain restaurants then this is not the place for you it is run on a system and seems to be run well.  I am giving it a four star rating based off of it being a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
23,Rachel R.,"Kent, WA",65,48,277.0,4.0,2017-06-10,Gotta love the 2 for $20 or $25.   Appetizer and Main course.  Yes pls!  Does the trick!  Good variety of choices!  It's cool that they have a Carside to go convenient!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

26,Neal F.,"Kent, WA",0,61,3.0,3.0,2017-08-12,"I went in and had some club soda and some wings just to have an easy meal.   Service was fine the food is just OK, nothing great and the price is about the going rate.  Today it is tough to get out without spending $20 for the simplest of eats.  They did show a football game which rescued the visit but unless I have a coupon I will pass....nothing seperates this from a Red Robin and others...a shame too.  Easy to see why many of these are closing in the US.  I was told those were franchises.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
29,Stacy O.,"Renton, WA",0,12,,2.0,2017-10-17,"Had lunch at this location last week and was a bit disappointed. I had the Southwest Steak Salad here previously and loved it, so I ordered it again this time. It did not live up to my expectations. It had a smaller portion of steak, and it's quality wasn't quite up where it should have been. Pretty fatty. The dressing also was rather bland this time. We also ordered the Spinach-Artichoke dip as an appetizer and it was very blah. Consistency seems to be an issue at this location. Service was good, however.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
20,Dign G.,"Seattle, WA",132,27,200.0,4.0,2017-12-02,"Place has a few bad reviews & 3 star rating but I had a pleasant experience overall. The food was good and the price was decent. The staff was very nice and polite.  SERVICE: Came when it looked pack but were seated in about 5 mins despite the hostess saying the wait would be about 10-15 mins. Servers were very kind and patient -- we ended up changing our order and they were flexible. Gave no attitude. Manager also came out. Served and greeted a few tables. It was very nice.  MAIN:  My boyfriend and I ordered the 6oz. And 8oz steaks. The steaks were cooked evenly and accordingly to what we had requested. They both tasted good. The broccoli on the side were a little overcooked so there was no crunch to them.  SIDES: They actually brought me the loaded potato casserole bake instead of my mashed potatoes. They fixed it quickly and brought me the right side in less than 2 minutes. The loaded garlic mashed potatoes were good though. There were at least 3 scoops of mashed potatoes -- couldn't finish it all. Boyfriend's twisted tots were cooked nicely and none of them fell apart. The mozzarella sticks were like standard mozzarella sticks, cheesy.  DESSERT: Got the brownie bite. Came with vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce drizzled on it. Brownie was warm and melted in your mouth. Very chocolatey. Good balance with the vanilla ice cream",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
22,Jamie B.,"Renton, WA",13,73,2.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"Hey, doll. Could you scare up another round for our table over here? And tell the cook this is low grade dog food. I've had better food at the ballgame, you know?

21,Nola K.,"Kent, WA",0,26,,1.0,2018-01-06,"We returned to this Applebee's after a year as they always seemed to mess up my order somehow but my husbands was usually right and I regret coming back, although we were seated promptly and the waiter brought our beverages right away it went downhill after that, our order of appetizers (classic plate) took twenty minutes to arrive at our table and I had to immediately send them back as they were cold, not warm, COLD, of course this meant our dinner came out two minutes later since we asked to have our entrees after our appetizers, my hubby ordered a steak medium rare preferably on the rarer side it was well done and dry, my meal was ok but also dry...we asked for a Togo container for the steak as we planned to give it to our dog, after waiting ten minutes we left empty handed, I doubt if we will return since this place has let us down on numerous occasions",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
