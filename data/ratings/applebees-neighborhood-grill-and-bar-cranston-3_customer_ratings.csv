26,Nick Z.,"Warwick, RI",5,83,7.0,3.0,2012-10-23,"I like this particular Applebees.  It took me forever to find this place (OK, I'm a little slow).  Glad I did, though.  I'm guessing they cleaned their act up since some of the last reviews.  I usually get the steak cooked medium.  Always good for a chain steak.  I'm not a fan of the mashed potatoes, as they have bits of skin in them, and the mixed veggies more often than not look sad.  My girl got a chicken alfredo type dish and she liked it.  I gotta say the potato twisters are good, but the queso blanco stuff they give ya is out of this world!  I wish I could just order a giant bowl of it with a spoon and sit alone in a corner huddled up in a ball eating the stuff.  Staff is good, service good, decor, meh, but I have to give them high marks on the fire depatment stuff in the doorway.  And yes, I am biased there, so sue me. All in all, if you can find the place, I say give it a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
2,Rick B.,"Dallas, TX",113,7,,4.0,2013-01-13,"Applebees is reasonably priced; the food is Great, served hot, & the Service is very good.

25,Erin N.,"North Providence, RI",141,330,180.0,4.0,2013-03-16,"Every time I come to this location there is an issue. Either they over charge for something stupid, dint follow directions when you ask for something simple (like dressing on the side), or you order a mixed drink, and there is no ""mix"" in the drink. Although a convenient location, there are others that are MUCH better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
5,B R.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,1.0,2013-11-09,"This apple bees sucks, don't bother coming if your not white, this is the sixth bad experience in a row. Ever single time Ive came here the service is crap, worst apple bees I've been to. This is actually the closest one to me but I prefer to make the drive down to the warwick apple bees where they actually know how to treat their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3?start=20,,,,,
24,Christine C.,"Cranston, RI",9,4,7.0,1.0,2014-08-19,"Tonight's experience was awful. Our waitress Lisa L was rude , slow and made me never want to come here again. My daughter asked for the grilled chicken and Apple sauce she brought her grilled cheese. My other daughter asked for the pizza and yogurt with strawberrys on the side. There were no strawberries on the plate.  When I asked about it she said they were out. Ok... That would have been nice to know before she ordered it. I ordered the three cheese pene with two breadsticks s because both the girls liked them. When I she only brought one I asked for the second and she never brought it. When asked for s one napkins she rolled her eyes and again never brought it. I'm normally an excellent ripper. I asked another waitress to bring s one boxes and the check because I would have rather eaten our food at home. 56.00 later and I'm very unhappy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
21,Brandy D.,"Cranston, RI",1,25,1.0,3.0,2014-12-01,"Used their carside pickup service.  The website said 15 minutes, it took 35 (kind of took the convenience out of it).  I don't think that it was the employees, they were going as fast as they could, but 15 minutes is clearly not a reasonable estimate for the customer volume at dinner time and they should change the website. Food was good for a chain restaurant.  We got the hamburger sliders the cajun chicken/shrimp.  Food was just what we expected and prepared well.  If the website had been more accurate for time, it would have been a much more positive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
18,Keoammara C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",109,16,4.0,1.0,2014-12-14,"I absolutely hated my experience here. I saw my waitress chit chatted with another employee who I believe was off the clock enjoying some food. She even counted her tips when talking as I sat at my table waiting for my food. She forgot to get  me my blue cheese I asked for which I would've had with my appetizer. She only came back to us once she saw another waiter had brought out our entrees. I will never ever come back to this establishment. How does the supervisor or manager on duty not recognize such terrible service. This person was still working yet she was sitting down talking to someone for about ten minutes. Sitting down enjoying conversation of which was stupid... ""Oh he sent me a picture of himself...."" Like really at least whisper!!!! I was on vacation when I visited RI but I was born and raised there. So the hospitality of the waitstaff sucked. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
19,Paul H.,"Narragansett, RI",10,18,11.0,2.0,2015-01-11,"So I walk in to APPLEBEES spurred by advertisement that I saw on TV/ or did I see it.   I saw,I thought,  a PUB MENU advertising a meal for $9.99. I found an APPLEBEES.   I sat down at my booth; found the PUB menu; found a choice of 5 meals; chose one, and I was presented with a bill for $18.50. ($2.89 for iced tea) Feeling like the lady who left her car keys in the refrigerator,  I stopped by the hostess and asked where is the PUB MENU for $10. Oh! She replied; that price is for only one item on the PUB MENU ( a lost leader).  Except there are no prices on the PUB MENU.   Surprise! APPLEBEES may you earn your just reward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
17,Steve R.,"Cranston, RI",5,58,5.0,3.0,2015-05-08,"The remodel looks nice, but inside the mediocre food and service remain.  There are a few good servers here, but many seem to just go through the motions.  I haven't had a chance to try and of the new appetizers yet. There is some good here such as the 2 for 20 specials, and the half priced appetizers in the mid afternoon and 9 PM to close.  Monday Night is a good time to go with all burgers priced at $6.99.  While there is better dinning spots in the area, Applebees is always a spot to go to In a pinch for mid priced American Fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
20,Kyle L.,"Cranston, RI",170,8,8.0,2.0,2015-08-09,"I wanted to give this applebees another try since it got a new remodel and I have to say the inside looks a lot better with a decent sized sports bar but unfortunately the food is still horrible. I ordered the sirloin steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes (one of the more expensive items on the menu) and it was by far the toughest worst steak I've ever had, the shrimp was tiny and tasted microwaved. The sever was very polite, friendly and attentive which was the only reason why I didn't make a big deal about it. I strongly recommend not coming here if your looking for Quality food but it's not a bad place to grab a drink at the bar. If you do get food here order an app or a burger something hard to screw up. Only reason it doesn't get a one star is cause of the new look and the bar that is all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
22,R. S.,"New York, NY",0,10,,1.0,2015-12-14,I've visited Applebee's in states like New Hampshire and New York. This was my first time visiting the Applebee's in RI and it was a total disappointment. The food was tasteless and cold; I asked for my steak well done and it was still medium. The waitress slammed our drinks and plates on the table... She was in a very bad mood and even my friend noticed. Truly bad experience and I don't plan on coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
11,Joshua J.,"London, United Kingdom",33,295,1.0,1.0,2015-12-28,"Get ID'ed for a beer, they refuse service because my licence has expired. My government issued licence  that, had it been a week earlier, would've been accepted. I get it, some places try to curb 16 year olds from using their older brothers ID but dude, would people who used someone else's ID try to use it for a Coors light at 2:30pm at the Applebee's bar?

15,Aleshia A.,"North Providence, RI",10,14,62.0,3.0,2015-12-31,"Applebee's just got YELPED!!!! I havent been there in many years. A really comfortable environment, with a bar and TVs everywhere. The waitress was really nice and checked on us very frequently. The dishes were basic in my opinion. The portions could had a little bit fulfillment but the service was great, and the were food was fantastic and the drinks were wonderful.  In the future, i would definitely go again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,

23,Nicole T.,"Narragansett, RI",0,15,,1.0,2016-10-03,"This place should be shut down. Absolutely TERRIBLE service. My company orders Applebees takeout from this location 2-3 times a week. As of recent, their online ordering system has been down. In previous experience, the manager had been extremely understand and took all of our payments patiently over the phone (we typically spend anywhere from $50-$200 a trip, no to mention when we hold meetings there and spend $500-$700). Today, I spoke to ""manager"" Chris who sounded about 15. He scoffed in my face, refused to take payment over the phone ""no matter what they have done for me in the past"" and proceeded to hang up on me. I called back to tell him we will never be ordering from them again and he laughed at me. I was a restaurant manager for two years and I'm embarrassed to say I've ever eaten from here. I was later informed by Applebees Corporate that there is no ""Chris"" working in management. Go figure. ""Chris"" should be fired, and I would recommend a complete evaluation of your staff if you plan on staying in business. These awful reviews stand for themselves. Just horrible. Run by immature children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,

14,Jessica N.,"Providence, RI",0,6,2.0,1.0,2017-03-16,"Was starving after a long day of work so my boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner. Got seated and was asked what we wanted to start with for drinks, I asked for a glass of water with lemon and my boyfriend asked for a pomegranate iced tea. I got my water without lemon, my boyfriends pomegranate iced tea tasted like regular iced tea. Ok, I let it slide. Ordered our food, I ordered a medium rare steak with regular mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with melted cheese. And a small bowl of chicken tortilla soup. My soup came out cold! My steak was medium well instead of medium rare AND I got my broccoli with no cheese on it, but instead got cheese and bacon on my mashed potatoes which I didn't ask for, and my broccoli was salty as hell! My boyfriend also said his food was salty. Needed the waiter but he took too long, smh. Will never come to this place again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
13,Betty B.,"Warwick, RI",2,34,,1.0,2017-03-17,"My husband likes to order from this location. Why? I have no idea. I guess the boneless Buffalo Wings he orders always come out fine. However, the last three times he ordered Oriental Chicken Salad for me, the lettuce was nasty. I don't like the standard Asian greens they make it with, so I get romaine lettuce. All three times the lettuce has been old/spoiled. The edges are either brown/black or the leaves are slimy dark green. It's like the lettuce was frozen in a bag and then left out for days. Based on some of the other recent reviews, I don't get why they're still around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
10,Blessed And Highly Favored A.,"Providence, RI",0,3,,3.0,2017-08-16,"The food was good the server seemed shady. I think I was hearing her talking about me. I guess she thought I am not good enough for my husband. I am much younger then him 10 years younger, but I guess she thought differently. Because I am white and always had sensitive skin ,etc.... People should stop judging others looks , do onto others what they would do unto you. Be careful also because something may happen to you that ruins your looks and the evil people will do to you what you did to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,,,,,
7,Aneesah C.,"Providence, RI",68,7,6.0,5.0,2017-10-25,My mom and I decided to go to Applebee's last night for the $1 margaritas and couldn't help but order food. First I want to say that I love this location! The staff here are always welcoming and friendly. I feel like they provide excellent customer service and other locations should take notes. Anyways we decided to switch it up and ordered the chicken wonton tacos. Oh. Em. Gee! Heaven in my mouth! I literally no longer want tacos any other way. The combined flavors leave your mouth watering and wanting more. I highly recommend these tacos!! They topped them with a slaw that was sweet and perfect with the hint of spice from the chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
9,Alyssa F.,"Cranston, RI",306,2,,1.0,2017-11-09,If it was my call they wouldn't get any stars and that's because there Manager is the rudest person I have ever dealt within the industry. All other staff is so nice. But the manger is literally a disgrace. So rude and talked down to my table after my boyfriend was denied a drink with his paper ID from renewing his license. I understand there is certain protocol but no need to talk down upon us like we were kids. Thankfully the GM was there and we asked to speak to him he was very nice. But overall I was disgusted. I forget his name but it could have been Tom? Awful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cranston-3,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
