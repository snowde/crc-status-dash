30,Joe L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,16,,1.0,2013-04-08,"You know the menu and decor.  The only reason this one is still open at all is because Crestview, FL has no other sit down restaraunts in town.  Other than that there is no reason to go back.  The service has been lousy everytime we visit.  The food is ok when you get it.  Last time we went they forgot my son's meal and blamed it on the cook.  It took another 20 minutes to get him a corn dog out to the table!  No apologies, no discounts nothing.  We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

31,Meredithe M.,"Bisbee, AZ",30,120,179.0,3.0,2013-07-31,Typical Applebees.  The service was good and it wasn't too crowded.  Their menu has a little bit of everything and the kids like it.  The wedge salad was yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
28,Boo L.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",10,203,4.0,1.0,2014-04-15,"I'm giving up on this location. I am tired of the apathy displayed by employees on all levels, to include management.

23,Leigh J.,"Athens, AL",5,5,4.0,3.0,2014-07-07,"We've eaten at Applebee's many times, it's always good. Our meal last night however wasn't that great! I ordered the quesadilla burger, which I normally love! It was so salty I couldn't eat it. Service was lousy!! & they were not very busy.

24,Kathy S.,"Rapid City, SD",17,70,1.0,1.0,2014-12-29,"While visiting the area, we've eaten here 4 to 5 times in the past 3 years. We keep hoping the manager has changed or the franchise has swooped in to fix the mess. The server's apathy is never a disappointment. They hang out in the back and never seem to come back. The food has been good most of the time, but takes absolutely forever to come to the table. We've finally given up. If the help is that lax in public, what's going on with the cooks in the kitchen? We're out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
22,Matt G.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",4,21,8.0,5.0,2015-02-04,"Clearly there's been a change in leadership at this location...the previous reviews point to rampant apathy among the serving staff and inattentiveness...however, my family experienced quite the opposite. We went to the Bayou Blvd. location in Pensacola and had one of worst experiences ever from a chain. I left a review on that one if you want to look at it for an idea. The district manager contacted me and addressed all my concerns accordingly and indicated he would make it mandatory for servers to write down orders going forward, and to emphasize the importance of accuracy. This Crestview location was OUTSTANDING. Even the food quality was night and day compared to the Pensacola location, which only leads me to believe whoever is hiring there is clearly doing it wrong -- call the Crestview folks and see how they're doing it, because it's working. The staff all kept coming to our table to play with our son and really made us feel welcome, which isn't something you see out of most chain restaurants. We will definitely be back here, and we now understand why this place is always so packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676
26,Robin P.,"DeFuniak Springs, FL",2,1,,1.0,2015-04-06,Went here for Easter dinner. This has never been my favorite place but hubby likes it. Food portion is now half of what it was a month ago. My oldest daughter got the penne pasta. Bottom of bowl was covered that was all. Bread sticks were hockey pucks. Same with the hubby's mac n cheese dish. Youngest got 3 tiny chicken fingers. Mother in law barely got a side dish. My steak was over cooked and the shrimp was pure rubber. When we complained the waitress burst into tears and the manager Scott was rude and condescending. Told us to complain on the website. That's my next stop. Will NOT be back!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

16,Ronald B.,"Crestview, FL",15,49,167.0,4.0,2015-11-09,My wife and I went on Monday because their burgers are $6.99 from 4pm to closing. We wanted to try the burgers and we were impressed. My wife had the blazen Texas burger with sweet potato fries. She didn't care for the pull pork on the burger because it was to sweet. She loved the burger and fries. I had the triple bacon burger with fries. The burger was real juicy. I had to use two napkins. The burgers were great for $6.99 but I think they are a little overpriced for their regular cost of $10.99. We had great service from Andrew K. Give them a try on Monday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3,,,,,
17,Don A.,"DeFuniak Springs, FL",1,1,1.0,1.0,2015-11-20,This was a pathetic excuse for a meal. I ordered the Bourbon street chicken and shrimp. See the pic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3,,,,,
21,Debbie J.,"Milford, CT",3,8,1.0,3.0,2016-01-04,"Food was alright. We went for burger Monday. They asked us simple pink or no pink and somehow even tho I asked for pink and my fiancé asked for no pink, I got absolutely no pink (which ruins a burger for me) and he got a little pink.  That added our waitress did not smile once. She was efficient and always brought out new refills and such but a little common courtesy and kindness and genuinity would have gone a long way. Also we waited twenty minutes while there was like 5 open tables and other people waiting so kind of annoying. They give you tons of mozz sticks tho!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,,,,,
27,Ashley W.,"Crestview, FL",0,10,,3.0,2016-01-28,"The food is good. The won ton tacos are absolutely delicious. The service is hit or miss depending on the server you get. However, one persistent problem is the heating/air conditioning. Apparently they have to send an email to someone to get permission to turn the AC down, and whoever is giving this permission must intend to turn the customers into decorative ice cubes. I understand some restaurants do this to cause people to eat faster, but it causes us to not want to dine there at all except in the cold winter months, when they have at least a little heat and even though it's still cold, at least the cold air isn't being blown on you while you're trying to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20,,,,,
15,Lissette O.,"Niceville, FL",228,2,,1.0,2016-05-26,"If there was a possibility of putting negative stars that is what I would have done.  A. WE WOULD LIKE OUR STEAKS WELL DONE. We got 4 very red steaks 1 hr after ordering then once they took them back to cook them properly not only were they still not fully cooked but they switched all the steaks around. Mark the meat so that grandma dosnt get lil johnnys cut up squares. B. Cheese potatoes NEED CHEESE!!!!! Sliced potatoes with sour cream and 6 STRANDS of cold cheese does not count.  C. Shrimp asian salad...... Did you buy a bag of mixed greens from the walmart across the street, throw 3 shrimp on it and call it Thai salad??  D. What canned brand were those sweet potato gravy thing you served us? Id like to know what kind to avoid when grocery shopping.  E. Grilled zucchini should be grilled all the way through. I understand your confusion with that since the steak wasnt properly grilled either.  F. Mixed veggies SHOULD BE MIXED VEGGIES. Not cold zucchini and some peppers. G. MY MOM DIDNT WANT RICE OR POTATOES!!!! She asked for green beans. So if she corrects you then you should kindly correct the order that you did not place correctly. H. Why would you sit 7 people at a 4 person table? Not just that but was selina playing the ""how many dishes can we stack on the table"" game?  I.

By the way they weren't busy. I could see 3-4 workers keep looking around the corner. I finally asked a guy was he our waiter and he said no, Carissa is. He said I told her nine times to come over and he would go tell her nine more times. She finally came over got our order which included a bar drink. She brought our teas and never got the bar drink. She was over there laughing with the bartender. He never made the drink. So we decided to go somewhere else!!  Beef O'Bradys it is!  So, if u happen to go there, don't get Carissa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3,,,,,

5,Kathy B.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,2.0,1.0,2017-04-24,"I don't know how this Applebee's stays open. I foolishly ignored the low ratings and went anyway. The problem is bad food and even worse management. I was served my very first inedible Caesar salad. I didn't think that was possible!  Super thick, sour dressing that was so heavy you couldn't taste the lettuce. After sending it back was served a raw burger. It wasn't even rare! Cold, raw meat. The manager ran and hid. No apology, nothing! The only positive thing I can say is that our server was great. She was so embarrassed at the kitchen and management. I felt bad for her. Stay away.

8,Andrea M.,"Hinesville, GA",13,11,,4.0,2017-05-16,I have been to this Applebee's a few times. Each time that I've gone I've had very nice servers and food that was served hot and true to the Applebee's brand. I have not had any issues with waiting. Then again when I go out to eat I believe that is about enjoying the environment and people that I'm with. It's not about expecting food to be thrown out at me. So maybe if it did take a while I didn't notice because I was too busy enjoying my company. I do enjoy eating here and only took one star off because of Applebee's menu itself and that's not something this location can change.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

9,Kao S.,"Crestview, FL",131,2,,1.0,2017-08-08,"So check this - my wife and I  decided to go to Applebee's Grill & Bar in Crestview, Florida. We get seated and the restaurant doesn't seem too busy so we are expecting it to be fairly fast since it's just two of us. As we wait for our waiter more customers start to come in and they are being served before us, I didn't think much of it i thought maybe my server is dealing with something. 10 minutes go by and more customers are being seated and served before us. Another 5 minutes go by and still no waiter... I look around me and angela is the only two minority in the whole restaurant and I'm not saying they are racist or nothing I'm sure they didn't mean to forget about us. But 25 minutes without a server come on! Do better Applebee's Grill & Bar I didn't even get a water!!! 25 minutes in and nothing!!!
