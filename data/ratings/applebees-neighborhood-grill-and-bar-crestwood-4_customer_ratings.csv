55,David N.,"Willowbrook, IL",167,532,1861.0,4.0,2012-01-14,"Not a big fan of rating food chains, but our recent visit prompted a good post of the lovely Yelp! I've stopped here plenty of times in the past, and we've always had decent food and not much to complain about. My recent visit was one of the best I've had here. No wait whatsoever for a table. Our service was excellent. Chips & Salsa app was a nice break from your typical greasy, oily, freshly fried tortilla chips at the local taqueria. The chips were hot, crisp, with close to no trace of oil, and plenty of salt. The salsa was good too. Tried the Sizzling Asian Shrimp with Vegetables and was definitely pleased. Tons of sizzzle, flavor, the right of amount of everything. Definitely a must for anyone trying to fit back into their skinny jeans after the holidays. My wife's  steak with bruschetta was pretty good, and her $1.00 Brownie Bite was the perfect size after a filling meal. Didn't believe it when I saw the price, but for $1, you get a good size piece of brownie, chocolate sauce, and a nice scoop of ice cream. Definitely worth checking out. Thanks for dinner tonight Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestwood-4?start=40,1.584,1.584,1.584,1.584,1.584
41,Jennifer H.,"Park Ridge, IL",104,31,2.0,1.0,2012-07-15,"I tried to order the Curbside to Go Service the other night for dinner.  It was a simple request: a salad with chicken in it and a chicken wings appetizer. I was put on hold and jockeyed between employees 3 times before anyone even took my order.  Then, I finally placed the order and said that I'd like to delay it a bit so that I could finish my work--pick it up in 30 minutes instead of 15.  I was told that the entry system was unreliable when it came to delaying orders like that.  Chances are that someone would still make the food and it would just sit there. WTF? Even if this is the truth, how is it good business to TELL people that?  So I asked, ""Just to clarify, you are telling me that I need to call back to accommodate your system?""  The reply? ""If you want your food to be hot, yes."" I will never eat there again, and that's a shame because I hate to cook and find myself eating out quite frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestwood-4?start=40,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003

42,Jennie R.,"Oak Lawn, IL",56,21,5.0,1.0,2014-01-06,"I've been here only a couple of times but last night was really bad. As everyone knows there was a nice snow storm so we thought we would grab something to eat while we were already out. We were seated right away. Our server was over to us in just a couple seconds to see what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend asked if they had dr. Pepper and she said no but we have cherry Pepsi. That is no where close to being dr pepper! It took at least 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. So we were looking through the menu and there weren't that many choices for the 2 for 20 or 2 for 24 which is what we went there for. So we settled on spinach and artichoke dip with 2 entrees of their Mac and cheese.  It took another 10 minutes or so to bring out the appetizer. The chips were super oily but other than that nothing to complain about.  So I was really looking forward to this Mac and cheese and boy was I disappointed. The chicken tenders that came on top were okay, but the noodles tasted nothing like Mac and cheese. They had a barbecue/honey mustard taste and I didn't eat one bite of it. I'm a huge bread fan too so I thought I would at least enjoy the bread stick, but nope. It was dry and the seasoning that they put on top was just terrible. And with all of this happening, our waitress never stopped by us to see how everything was. They were all too busy trying to close early rather than take care of the customers they had in there. I wish we took the opportunity to just get up and leave when they were all hiding in the back. Definitely not worth $30. My other experiences were okay but this one really made me not want to come back ever.  I probably won't go back to any Applebee's. They're supposed to be known for awesome service, a fun atmosphere, and great food, but I never received any of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestwood-4?start=40,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003

My girlfriend and I stopped by this Applebee's location for a few drinks and appetizers before heading to the movies theatres. I should try tried to. When walked in we were greeted and sat very quickly. There were a total of 7 tables seated in the place and no one at the bar. After sitting at are table for 15 mins we were finally greeted by are rude server. ""What you want to drink?"" With attitude.  No hi my name is, sorry for the wait, welcome to Applebee's. So we ordered 2 brewtus of bud lights.  We sat for another aggravating 10 mins and the server came back asking are you ready to order with out bringing my delicious beer. I asked her if we could get are beers. She said sorry about that the bartender is busy. Horrible excuse since the bar was 20 feet from me and there was one person sitting at the bar. I looked over to the bar and are beers were sitting there as the bartender was cleaning his area. She left the table to go grab are beers and on her way back decided to have a few minutes conversation with another server.  When she finally made it to the table we decided we were done with it. Told her we don't want your beer after sitting for 35 minutes. She walked away. After we put are jackets on a manager came over and said a beer would be comped if we still wanted to stay. I told him to learn to have better service.

I'm usually not in this area but was out with a friend so we decided to stop in for a bite to eat. We honestly would have been better off going to Sonic's across the way. We were seated promptly but that's the only highlight. Once seated it took almost 15 minutes for us to get water. I had to ask the hostess for the waitress. The waitress finally showed up and and nonchalantly apologized for the wait. We ordered our (water) drinks and waited another 10 minutes before getting them. After that we placed our order, which included an appetizer, it took awhile for the appetizer to make it to our table. Needless to say our entrées came out very late and the waitress blamed that on the new cooks in the back.  I wanted to speak with the manager however that didn't go any better than the terribly slow service and so-so food.

So I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and was informed that a glass cost $8 while the entire bottle cost $10.  Simple math told me that getting the bottle was obviously the way better deal BUT I didn't really want to have to drink an entire bottle of wine myself yet that is totally (and somewhat unsurprisingly) what happened. I should have asked if they would've re-corked the bottle for me so I could have taken the remains of the wine home rather than feel like I had to drink it all.  I'm thinking that they probably don't do that, but I could be wrong. I decided that I should probably eat something since I had to drive 35 miles back home. I quickly perused the menu and discovered a grilled cheese sandwich that came with tomato basil soup.  Awesome.  I ordered it, and it was decent.  It was one of those four cheese deals, the ""fancy"" kind.  I also sampled one little piece of my friend's pretzel sticks with beer cheese.  That was also rather sinfully tasty.

They were both well done. Hers came with some kind of BBQ Ranch sauce, which she asked for on the side because she didn't know if she'd like it. They put it on the burger. The menu said ""Lettuce, Tomato and pickles available upon request."" I specifically said no lettuce, but definitely pickles. I got lettuce, but no pickles. I ordered  a mushroom/swiss burger. I expected to get mushrooms on top of the meat. They claim they mix them in with the meat. No they don't. At least I didn't find them. the burgers had absolutely no taste. I might as well have ordered wall paper paste. It would have tasted the same, and cost less. This was my first time at Applebees. I went because I got a gift card for Christmas.

We decided to take our daughter-in-law and 3 grandkids out since our son was working. Applebees advertised free kids meals for Easter. The kids meals (pizza, chicken strips and a burger) were ok I guess because the kids finished their food. Either that or they were very hungry!  Dtr-in-law got a pasta and shrimp salad which was tasteless so she doctored it up with salt and pepper. My hubby and I ordered the ribs. Big mistake. They were so tough and dry that you couldn't get the meat off the bone. And very watery garlic mashed potatoes. The only thing we semi-enjoyed were the mozzarella sticks ordered as an appetizer (obviously pre-made frozen).  Needless to say, we walked out of there very hungry.

Service was very fast and friendly. I highly recommend. On a separate trip, I had a couple late night apps. The pot stickers tasted good, though a bit small. I'd prefer a few less and bigger.

For $20, my 5yr old got the wrong order, I got a nasty nasty fajita wrap and salad combo....aaaaaand a way, waaaaay over priced coffee ($2.50 for a thick, syrupy sludge???).  No thanks. The kid ordered grilled chicken tenders and got fried chicken nugget instead. She didn't complain - - so ok, whatever. I got a wrap and a house salad. The salad was 10% browned lettuce greens, and 90% toppings of diced tomato, cucumber, cheese, and some token bacon. The toppings would be great if there was actually some SALAD to go with them.  The wrap was a SouthWestern Fajita type deal. Basically it was ""Red Onions Smothered in Cheddar"". Nasty. Truly. I boxed it up and took it home to the hubby to eat. Bleh.  We happened to have a lot of errands in the neighboring strip mall and thought we'd get a nice lunch while we were there. Instead I ate a few bites of salad, my 5yr old at a few fried nuggets, and I payed waaay more than I would have for a comparable meal at the local fast food place - that would have tasted just as good :(  We got home, I made myself a PBJ (Because I couldn't eat the onion-wrap) and the kiddo asked for some fried eggs (because the three nuggets weren't very filling).

18,Ricardo D.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,3.0,2016-06-05,"This breaks my heart, because the staff at this Applebee's always tries very hard to please.  At least that has been my experience.   Usually I stop in after work and get something to go, and since the big shake up of a few years back, when the staff changed almost overnight, the food has been on a downward slide.  The last time I ordered their ""Two for Twenty"" the food portions were tiny and the selections bland and just tossed in the to-go containers.  Then I popped in just to have a beer and notice a pile of logs in the entrance.  New menu, new choices, etc.!  Okay.  Fine.  Came back with a friend not long ago.  I ordered the 8oz Sirloin with roated veggies and a baked potato.  My friend ordered the salmon with grilled veggies and rice.  The bartender asked me if it was okay to bring my potato out after the entree was service, as I guess it was being baked.  We weren't in a hurry, so I said to just bring it all out when the spud was ready.  The entrees came out. My stead was okay.  Juicy but, honestly, not as good as their old, old choices of steak, like the Cajun steak.  The salmon had the texture of cardboard and no taste.  And... my potato was still pretty solid and uncooked.  I didn't feel like sending it back, so I just left half of it.  My friend ate some of her salmon and a bit of the rice, which she said tasted bland.  Here is the real problem.  It is Saturday night and the tappers are broken.  Yes!  There was not an ounce of tap beer to be had, and we like tap better than bottles, but since we were already there, we stayed and drank bottled, which was fresh.  The bar itself was empty, and the lack of drought beer may have been one of the reasons.  The place itself was fairly crowded.  Applebee's can't find it's niche.  It wanted to be the neighbood bar, and was offering specials on appetizers after nine, trying to attract a later night crowd, but everything about it screams ""family"".   It used to be that Applebee's had about the best food. I would choose it over a Friday's or a Chili's or even an Outback, especially on the road for work, where I just wanted somthing that wasn't going to kill me.  Now the food is questionable, and the many menus and inserts, like so many places, leave you confused as to what it is that your ordering, and price.  You have to look at the big pictures on the menu inserts and then hunt for it on the regular menu.  Many of these chain places seem to do this.  Anyway, I heard Applebee's is suffering from lack of biz, and if they don't straighten out their food and service (no tappers on a Saturday, C'mon!) they will end up closing the rest of their outlets in Illinois.  The entire chain seems to need ""Restaurant AND Bar"" Rescue.   And that's too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestwood-4,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

We both had the American burger. It was a disappointment. The meat was bland, and just plain greasy. I was surprised at how bad they were.
