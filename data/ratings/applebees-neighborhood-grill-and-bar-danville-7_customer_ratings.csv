8,Patrick J.,"Pinckney, MI",0,34,162.0,1.0,2012-05-04,"A 10 oz draft domestic is $3.89. The bartender made some excuse about the local tax being high, but that doesn't stop other local bars from charging reasonable prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
6,Phil B.,"Louisville, KY",106,64,29.0,3.0,2014-07-21,"The Saturday night I went, they had a DJ blasting radio music of the '90's and in pretty certain that I witnessed a drug deal go down at the bar....I could be mistaken but I highly doubt it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
4,Benjamin M.,"Danville, KY",67,3,1.0,1.0,2014-09-09,"Nothing let's you know what you're in for at a restaurant like old food. Expired produce, curdled yogurt, slimy fish, only a few things actually palatable were ordered, my Pepsi and her apple juice. Never have I ever had a decent meal at Applebee's danville, it's time I learned my lesson and stayed away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
3,Frustrated W.,"Sellersburg, IN",0,9,,3.0,2016-05-21,Food was great. Most of the staff seemed nice. Our server was a little rude and had to ask multiple times for items that we were missing. We were next to where their carryout was and the phone just kept ringing and ringing and nobody would answer to the point I was going to get up and unplug it but a manager heard me say something and they placed someone there. Like I said other servers looked to be engaged with their tables ours not so much. Our ticket says her name was Amanda L. but I don't know since she never told us. So go just hope you get a better server. Food was cooked perfect!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
5,Jessica T.,"Danville, KY",1,25,1.0,2.0,2016-07-08,"I will say Applebee's knows how to do bar food, but not real food.  I ordered salmon with a side Caesar salad and had to send the salad back because it was absolutely drenched in dressing (and I'm not that picky).  Salmon was okay.  What I was really upset with was my side of ""grilled vegetables"" that I paid an extra $1.50 for no less, zucchini that was cut in such HUGE chunks that they were literally raw in the middle and not very seasoned.  Not going back unless I'm drunk at midnight and want some greasy cheese sticks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
0,Russell C.,"Somerset, KY",20,149,28.0,3.0,2017-06-06,The new chicken with mozzarella and tomato is good. Appetizers are average. The server was fast and friendly. Would eat here again. The bathroom didn't smell the greatest.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
2,Ben P.,"Stanford, KY",1,7,4.0,1.0,2018-01-05,Ordered a bowl of soup and bourbon street chicken and shrimp.  Only got a bout a quarter of a bowl of soup but a good thing I guess since it was cold and slimy.  Shrimp were same and the chicken was way overdone and dried out. Potatoes were the only thing good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
1,Tammy M.,"Lexington, KY",43,52,268.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"To say this was the worse dining experience ever is an understatement. I guess now I know why this location only has 2.5 star rating.  We were seated immediately upon arriving and it took between 5-10 minutes before our waitress showed up to take our drink order. She was unfamiliar with most of what they had on tap. We ordered our drinks and had to wait a good while and then looked at the bar and realize that the issue was changing a tap out. No big deal but let us know what's going on. We finally received our beverages and then ordered our food. I checked in on Yelp immediately after our waitress took our food order. I kid you not it took almost 40 minutes to receive our meal.  I ordered the Chicken Fajita Rollups and extra mexi Ranch (this is normally served on the side as a dipping sauce). When I received my food the mexi Ranch was already on the rollups. Nope, not supposed to be prepared that way but I eat it anyhow. I did have to ask for extra on the side because I like to dip my fries in it as well.  Our waitress was a little preoccupied taking care of her friend that was sitting at the table next to ours. We got the impression she was also an employee but not working today. We rarely saw her and when we did we had to ask for more drinks as one of our glasses was completely empty.  Moving forward, the bartender girl we heard yelling in conversation to the manager in the back. Wow, not good customer service and at one point she was leaving from behind the bar to the back and the words the start with ""G D"" came out of her mouth. So unprofessional!! Poor service all the way around by the server, kitchen and management. Not to mention the hostess which I'll spare you the details of what I witnessed. This is one restaurant we will never be back to. Crossed off the list when in Danville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danville-7,,,,,
