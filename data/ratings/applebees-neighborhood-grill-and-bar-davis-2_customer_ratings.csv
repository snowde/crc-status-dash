124,Kristi G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,4.0,4.0,2012-02-05,"Went in for a 5:30 dinner with a group of 21 and the restaurant was pretty empty.  The staff was very friendly and quickly accomodated for our large party.  Orders were very smooth while preparation was about an hour wait from arrival to serving we were all served together and enjoyed good food.  Most of us shared the 2 for $20 meals and the waitress put all the meals on to separate tabs which was very nice, splitting the costs between 2 and 3 people.  Check out was quick.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  would definitely return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=140,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.6719999999999997,2.32

The waiter didn't write down our order so when he came back with our food 45 minutes later!!  it was completely wrong. I ordered a half salad and was charged for the full thing, my friend ordered thai tacos and was given a burrito and another ordered Tuscan navy bean soup with no cheese and received tomato soup covered with cheese! When we spoke to the manager about all the mistakes he only offered to give us each 10% off of our individual bills which they taxed us on! So it was a whopping total of  30 cents off! WTF?? Then we said I think you can do better and the manager came back and gave one of us a free drink? Thats it.

52,Claire W.,"Miami, FL",164,339,1593.0,2.0,2012-04-10,"I USED TO LOVE APPLEBEE'S, BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. This place is like a BAD HABIT I can't break.  I give it 2 stars because I like the food but for a little while now, it's been not so bueno. SHORT VERSION: Slow service (will never use their to-go!), food is on the decline LONG VERSION: So, I called in a to-go order for an Oriental Chicken Salad ($9.99) and loaded mashed potatoes ($1.99), the guy on the phone said it would be around $12.  I drive there, park in the To-Go Parking...where they are supposed to spot your car and bring your food out.  Wellll, after 5 mins of waiting (in 97 degree weather mind you) I get out of the car and decide to walk in the restaurant to get the show on the road.  I walk through the patio and past 2 cashiers who don't bother asking me if I need help.  I tell them that I called in an order and one guy tells me to sit down then he disappears into the kitchen.  I see a to-go bag on the table across from me and wonder if it's mine.  Two minutes later, another guy walks to where I am, picks up the bag of food and proceeds to walk out the door.  He's going to my car and as he gives me the food, the bill is $2+ more than what they said on the phone (the potatoes are $3+).  I tell the waiter this and he goes back inside the restaurant to talk to the manager...I wait in the car with the AC on full blast.  He comes back out with my change...INCORRECT change might I add.  (I gave him $20.31 for a $14.31 bill and he comes back with $5 and change...DUH!)  By this point, I don't want to argue about the fact that they charged me more than what they said because frankly I am too freakin' hot and sweaty from waiting for them to give me my food.  And to top it off, my salad didn't come with enough dressing!  Usually when I eat it in the restaurant I have too much and now too little!! My go-to dish here were the RIBLETS; but they must have changed the way they cook it because it started tasting REALLY lousy...too CHEWY.  I usually order the oriental chicken salad and I really like the loaded mashed potatoes.  Their MANGO LEMONADE is also pretty good.   The service is so-so...depends on who you get.  The guy that looks like Horatio from SNL was pretty rude when I went with a party of 10.  He looked like he hated his job. BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could say I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN...but I don't know...just...tooo...yummy. I would go here again...if only my friends liked the place..haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.408,2.28

Davis is a small place and it is hard to find American comfort food, Applebee's saves the day. It is cozy, friendly, and lots of space for a couple or small group to enjoy. Love the BBQ sauce that comes with the onion rings, great happy hours makes appetizer really cheap, value menus (20 dollar for two giant courses)... very large portions that will feed poor davis students for days.  The drinks are generous and innovative, the corona-rita is literally a small corona (in its full bottle) combined with margarita in an enormous glass.

The first round, I came for the happy  hour and got the buffalo wings for half off. I got the sweet and spicy flavored ones and they did get pretty spicy after a couple of pieces. I love that the portions are so big just for the appetizers. I couldn't even finish all my wings and had to ask my friend to help eat the rest. I would always recommend the buffalo wings because it comes in an abundant of supply and is delicious.  For my second return, I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettucine. It was pretty good itself but it came out with rice instead of pasta so I was really confused! However, I did not care much because I like rice anyway. The portion seemed smaller than the pasta dish that I got on one of my other visits. Or it could be that I was just starving that night.

59,Cynthia W.,"Davis, CA",0,6,,3.0,2014-01-15,"Overall rating: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Food: 3 stars Value: 3 stars I was very happy when this Applebee's opened in Davis, as it's one of the only places in Davis where you can get general American cuisine, and still is. I use to be a regular here and ended up knowing most of the staff and management at one time. Yes, you read that right, past tense. Over the years the service has gone from great to just fair, and I've seen this place lose a lot of repeat business because of it, which is quite depressing because I'd like the place to stick around. When you do get service, in my experience, it's usually friendly, but more often than not you're going to have longer than average wait times. You definitely don't want to come here if you are on any kind of time schedule! If you're here just to chill and relax and have nowhere to go, it can be ok. The staff do seem to be more interested in talking with each other and doing small tasks like rolling up silverware than really paying attention to their customers, and this hurts business. While I understand certain tasks need to be done, customers should really come first, and it's irritating when, as a customer, you suddenly need something like a drink refill, extra napkins, etc and you can't get the attention of your waiter/waitress who is over in the corner rolling up silverware and chatting with their coworkers - no matter how slow business might be. Sitting at the bar helps eliminate some of these problems, but you shouldn't have to sit at the bar to have a decent meal with service. I've also had a few (though rare) experiences where they've been completely out of something basic - for example, tonight they had no ice cream. So much for ordering any dessert :( This place does have some good things going for it though. For starters, they are open late - usually until at least midnight. They also have free WiFi, clean restrooms, and when I've come in the place is always kept pretty clean in general. They have some decent happy hour specials, including late night happy hour (after 9PM Mon-Thur) where a number of appetizers are half price (but full size) - my favorites for this are the boneless honey BBQ wings (nearly a meal in itself), and the fried mozzarella sticks. There's the 2-for-$20 deal which is worthwhile if you like the offerings there (my husband and I usually choose this) - you get 2 entrees and a free appetizer. You save a couple of bucks off the normal price of each entree and get a free (full size) appetizer to boot. I've sometimes even ordered the 2-for-$20 for myself and just have the second entree and half the appetizer boxed up to take home for lunch/dinner the next day. Rare is the time I've had a bad meal (food-wise) here, but the food is also typical Applebee's, so it's not going to wow you in any way.

45,Derald S.,"San Rafael, CA",7,17,,1.0,2014-02-03,"I was planning to drive through Davis at about dinner time on Super Bowl Sunday, so I called in the morning to ask about specials for the game and whatnot.  I was told on the phone that there would be quite a few specials including half priced appetizers, and that they would continue as long as the game was on.  We have kids, so I thought it would be fun to just order a bunch of appetizers, catch the end of the game, and go home. First, the waitress seemed irritated that we were even there from the beginning  Then, we were told that the appetizer specials ended at 6pm, we got there at 615, but the drink specials were still going.  So, we ordered some kids meals (On special for $199, yay!) for the kids, 2 for 20 for us and a margarita.   Once we received our food, we didn't see our waitress again until I had to follow her nearly into the kitchen to ask for our check.  We were overcharged for (literally) every thing on our menu except the 2 for 20.  Idk how much 12oz margaritas usually are, but $7 for a well margarita seems steep, even NOT during happy hour.   The whole experience nearly from the time we walked in, to the time we walked out was negative.  Save yourself the trouble, push on to Sac or Vacaville, or just go somewhere else.   Boo  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.8600000000000003,2.72

When we told her that were were ready to order she snapped at us with, ""yea I know, everyone is ready to order."" Rude much. So after, we asked a different waiter if he could take our order and he was friendly and very helpful.  We finally ordered. I just got an Oreo milkshake because I wanted something sweet and fast. I was expecting it to come right away. But no. I waited 45 minutes for a milkshake. By the time I got it I wasn't even hungry.

I haven't been here for awhile and just so happened to be in the area and decided to come on tuesday for the all you can eat rib-let. First off, don't do it! it's not worth the $12 because you'll probably just get sick of one plate.

I don't think this has happened before at any other Applebee's so it was a nice touch.  We did have an issue, however, when it came to our check. One of us ordered a burger with a substitute of a salad instead of fries. When doing this in the past at other Applebee's, we've only been charged $1 for the substitution. When we got the bill, there was a $4+ charge for a salad. I believe this is the price of a separate side salad. I told the waitress this was incorrect, and she came back with a bill with a charge of $3.99, which I assume is the price of adding a salad to a meal, rather than substituting it for something else. I would not have minded this charge if I in fact ADDED the salad, and still got fries, but this was not the case. We unfortunately did not have time to sit there and hassle with the bill and teach the waitress how to do her job, so we paid the bill in full and instead took the amount we feel we were overcharged out of her tip.

I try the red light again and this time my server is there within a few minutes.  When I explained what happened he was very apologetic and admitted that the restaurant was having a ""really, really bad day"" (his words).  I actually felt terribly for the young guy.  I did tip him for his efforts, although he never came back to ask us if we need a beverage refresh.

I usually share a 2 for $20 which usually never fails me because you can't go wrong with the spinach dip or mozzarella sticks and the chick penne pasta, but those are no brainers that any restaurant could make if they really wanted to. They have happy hour specials depending on which day you go to so it's cool if you want to get a cheap drink.  I like their personal paying machine that they have at each table because it makes paying for groups less complicated. I will say service is a little lack luster and it varies on each visit.

I will start with the good which is the host who greeted in a professional manner and open the door for us. That was the only good part of this experience. The bad, which is the following: 1. Server putting on uniform in plain sight of the guests and using the tables where people eat at to place her clothes and using the chairs guests sit on to tie her shoes (which were not the required non slip shoes and clothes that are not appropriate for the work place in a restaurant) 2. Counted 4 servers who would get drinks from the back place them on a table that is designated for guests and would constantly go to the table to get sips from their drinks and to use their phones while they were on their shift and their sections (section of the restaurant designated to that specific server) would be waiting on their server to pass by and you can see this because everyone was looking around or right at them as they took their ""mini-breaks"" 3. Servers would leave their phones and other personal belonging at tables that are meant for guests and keep going back to these tables constantly (servers always had their nametags on even when taking 5-25min constant breaks in front of their customers)  4. Server empty out trash can at their station and came back to the table where her phone was in less than a minute which is not enough time to wash her hands, worst thing she came back with food to deliver to another table 5.

A table of elderly couples left because no one was serving them. We should have followed their lead but unfortunately we stayed. My friends food came out without any of the specifications. He is allergic to tomato and there was a giant tomato slice, it seemed almost hostile. I ordered a pasta bowl without chicken and it was completely flavorless, microwaved pasta with no texture. We quickly asked for the check and she kept trying to convince us to pay with the app. We gave her our credit card and she was gone for another 8 minutes. The stupid ridiculous apps supposed big selling point is that you can play games while you wait for your food....exvept that the games cost money and are added to your bill! And why is there even a slot on the bill for a tip if they have computers at every table to do the job of the waitress. Will never be back!

One of the ladies birtday is coming up so I called the  restaurant to verify I Could bring a cake and was told no problem. It was supposed to  be a surprise. That got screwed up, they don't sing happy birthday any longer (was not told that on hte phone), and the cake was cut in the back without my friend  seeing it. They cut a 8"" round decorated cake into 6 pieces like a pie causiing the cake to fall apart. We had allowed enough time to eat and then attend a play in Davis. I think it was a case of poor service due to the belief that older women in a group do not tip. BIG MISTAKE. We all have service industry backgrounds and my friends always give me grief because I overtip. Not yesterrday. What a disaster. It took over 45 minutes for one of our group to get a bloody maryand they told us that the bartender was slammed. Not one persn was behind the bar. So we were insulted and lied to.

We sat there for 10 to 15 minutes and NOONE had come up to us, they weren't that busy. A couple who was seated in the booth behind us were already being served. I was pretty pissed at this point so I went ahead and ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees on the monitor hoping that would alert someone's attention about 5 to 10 minutes later ""our server"" came over and asked if she could get us drinks and I told her I already ordered everything on the monitor. It took the bartender 15 mins to make my drink from the time I put it into the monitor. I looked over to see why she was taking so long. She was measuring all of the contents out for each drink she was making, do they not train bartenders to do counts here??? So our appetizer comes to our table, we got salsa Verde beef nachos with no jalapeños and it comes out with just cheese and meat so I had to send it back. 10 mins after we finish our nachos ""our server"" comes over and ask if we wanted anything else and we both were like we put in entrees and she says ""oh I didn't see that on the monitor"" leaves to go to the kitchen and comes out a few mins later with our food and it taste like it's been sitting under the heat lamps, my sister asked for no jalapeños on her burger and it had them on there, she mumbled under her breath about it and she heard her and asked if everything was okay, so my sister said well I asked for no jalapeños and the server argues with her saying the pico comes with jalapeño and asked if she wanted it taken back but we were already frustrated so she said no. Our server never came to check to see if our food was good, I was suprised to get a water refill after it had been sitting there. We ordered dessert from the MONITOR because our server was nowhere to be found and that suprisingly came out at a descent time. At the end she gives us our spit bill but I didn't bother to wait for her to come by and pick up our bill, so we payed on the monitor. I have never received service this bad. I've had some not so great service but nothing like this. I work in a restaurant as a server/bartender and I wouldn't have a job if this was the type of service I gave. Management here needs to retrain their crew because this is ridiculous.

Drinks took forever as well. 3 stars because I like coming here after work but seriously, servers need to step it up and move a little faster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,2.88,2.55,2.55,,2.6819999999999995

2,Luke C.,"Davis, CA",288,229,1034.0,3.0,2017-06-26,"Applebee's can be a really mixed bag. I've been here and have had a very satisfactory meal that I enjoyed quite a bit, and at other times it has been a total failure. But overall my experience has been positive. When the meal isn't very good, it's because the food is too salty when done incorrectly.  If you're going to Applebee's, I'd recommend the two for $20 or two for $25 deal. It's a great deal! You get an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer is full size and is a great way to start a meal. The selection that you can get is nice. I usually get either the boneless wings or spinach & artichoke dip and chips. (Hint: You can refill the chips, just ask!) As for the entrees, I really enjoy the ribs and mini ribs. They have a variety of flavors to choose from, and this is what they are known for. Some dishes, like the hamburger, come with way less food and will feel like a rip off. Don't go that route! One good thing just about every visit to Applebee's is the service. I don't think there was a time when the waitress wasn't very good. Tonight we had a server named Heaven. She was as good as her namesake. I think Applebee's is worth the visit if you order the right things. It's definitely not the best, but it can be a nice place to go every so often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,2.92,2.58,2.58,,2.716
69,Mike K.,"Auburn, CA",8,2,,4.0,2017-07-05,I was meeting a business associate there for lunch. When I pulled up I checked hours on Yelp and saw a very poor review. I must disagree with the poor review. The service was excellent and the manager stopped by twice to make sure we had everything we needed. Prices were fair and the food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=20,3.0,2.58,2.58,,2.748
16,Javier G.,"Davis, CA",77,3,,5.0,2017-08-11,"We love coming to this location. There aren't long waits like other Applebee's and its a relaxing environment with fewer people. The waiters and bartenders are the friendliest ones ever. We always get the 2 for $20/25 and the steak is pretty delcious and good. We love getting their boneless buffalo wings, they're always dripping with sauce! Good place to go from the usual crowded, overrated spots in Davis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,3.16,2.6,2.6,,2.8240000000000003

Ever since the new menu, Applebees has been using a weak premix but she can make it like the goodness it was before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,3.16,2.64,2.64,,2.8480000000000003

We had a few rounds of Patron Perfect Margaritas, appetizers, and a hot skillet plate. I was quite impress how our bartender waited on us while she worked the bar. It's obvious they are understaffed, but it did not significantly impact the quality of our service. Not a spot to be picky, but definitely a place for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,3.2,2.65,2.65,,2.87
4,Joe L.,"Fairfield, CA",0,9,8.0,1.0,2017-10-21,Quite possibly the worst service and meal I have ever gotten!  Stay away from this dump.  Waited 15 mins to be seated then waited 15 mins to get water.  Got boneless chicken wings and the chicken was raw!  Grossed me out.  Absolutely horrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,3.04,2.63,2.63,,2.7940000000000005
5,Blue B.,"Glenhaven, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-17,"Walked into this Applebee's and it was fairly quiet, so we assumed the service would be good and fast. However our waitress (Jessica I believe but she had no name tag) was not the nicest, and we watched the other waitress working serve food to other people and get them out the door quicker than our waitress could even bring us our drinks. Our waitress was not the most hospitable person, and when asking for more chips replied with ""you can finish those before I bring you more"", after that comment our attitude changed to not being as bright. When we did receive the food it was all cold, all three steaks, the sides and the burger order. We sent our food back and the manager came back and took care of us. Our steaks were bigger but still the same temp. Everything else was good. Our waitress never came back to check on us, and she took so long so we paid over the automated pay system. Very happy to have the manager come and resolve the food issue with a better attitude however, still disappointed in the disrespectful waitress. Will not be coming back on my way through. Don't even want to give one star!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2,2.88,2.59,2.59,,2.7059999999999995
