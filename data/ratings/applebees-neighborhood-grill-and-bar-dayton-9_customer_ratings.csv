3,Bill H.,"Dayton, OH",10,7,12,5.0,2014-07-08,"Even tho this location is in the midst of a huge re-model, Mgr & Staff were obviously friendly, quick & efficient . The food was perfect. Coming back to try the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-9,,,,,
2,Ericka W.,"Dayton, OH",40,22,6,4.0,2015-01-06,"I mean, it's Applebee's. I know that. I've always had really good food here, but then again, I've ordered the same thing since 2006. The food isn't why I felt compelled to write a review. My my most recent visit was the first time I've been since the new remodel. The place looked pretty good, but nothing was too spectacular. The coolest addition were the neat little tablets on each table! My boyfriend and I seriously couldn't stop playing with them the entire time we were there. The ease of being able to order appetizers and desserts was amazing. We were able to call our server to the table, too, which was great when we needed our bill. I worry that this might backfire on Applebee's, though. We obviously were their ideal customer: playing with the tablet caused us to pay the extra $1 for unlimited games, plus we were more inclined to buy the dessert we did... Well, okay, the salted caramel pretzel bites really sold themselves... (Actually, and I do apologize for the sidebar, the most well-recognized waiter/bartender at Applebee's gave us a free sample of the bites when they first came out because he told us how good they were. We were hooked, and we took an order home with us that night.) But, I worry that the tablets are going to be a hinderance for the waitstaff. I was compelled to say 20 minutes longer than I normally do. Not good!  The reason behind my four-star rating wasn't the tablets or the food. It was a combination of the waitress we had and the bathrooms. Our waitress seemed very put out by us being there, and the bathrooms were in a seriously despicable state. For a place that was remodeled a few months ago, the bathrooms looked like they didn't belong. The first stall I went to use was gross, so that was a no-go. The next stall had a gaping hole in the corner of the ceiling as well as a doorknob that wasn't even affixed to the door.  Those were the only unpleasant things about my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-9,,,,,
5,TheNugless ..,"Naples, FL",7,11,5,5.0,2015-01-24,Pretty simple... Great happy hour prices.. Great food... I am far from Applebee's fan on a general note. That being said... The crew here does a great job. The Won ton tacos are delicious and drink taste great. I had a great experience and if happy hour is your goal take a chance give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-9,,,,,
4,Tracy W.,"Miamisburg, OH",59,91,308,4.0,2015-05-30,Applebee's is always a staple we go to if we're out and need a quick bite. .better than fast food. .love the remodeling on this location. .I bummed that they discontinued the combo appetizer platter that was one of my favs.  Nice selection on the two for $20 or two $25 meals.  Our waitress Ashley was really good and very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-9,,,,,
1,Nicholas K.,"Chicago, IL",1,5,5,2.0,2017-01-17,"I fully recognize that you get what you pay for at restaurants.  It's an Applebee's, so my expectations are checked from the outset.  Even still, had the staff spent more time tending to their guests and cleaning rather than collectively sitting down talking among themselves about personal issues loud enough for customers to hear, perhaps the restaurant would be more successful. At one point, my server actually *yelled* across the room from the table at which she was sitting and kvetching at with other employees to ask if I needed anything.  Seriously?  This is work, not the time to converse with your friends and continuously play on your phone!  Leadership starts at the top, and when you see a manager sitting and talking about her tanning plans for 20 minutes all while the restaurant is an absolute pigsty, staff are clearly following this type of laissez-faire attitude.  Food was about average.  Overall, the district manager needs to fire the current management and retrain all existing employees.  I have no doubt a P&L somewhere is suffering as a result of lower-level management's incompetence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-9,,,,,
0,Larry M.,"Dayton, OH",16,79,12,5.0,2017-09-03,"OK? Here's the deal. I lived across the street from the Applebees on W. Dorothy Lane until it closed. I loved that place! Anywayyyyyyyy....... I was in Centerville and  looking for a great fish and chips place. I see an Applebees on Springboro on my way home and thought I would stop by. I was greeted with the friendliest smile I have seen in a while. Malone was the hostess and made me feel very welcome and important. The place was clean, not too noisy. My server was Brooke and gave us great service.  The fish and chips were amazing!  Just when I couldn't feel any happier..... Here comes SAM, The best GM on the EARTH!  Man, I really missed this guy. He is a great guy with an eye for detail.  He was the GM at the old DL location. We just had a great time talking about the old place. As Arnold would say..... I'll be BACK! And you should as well.
