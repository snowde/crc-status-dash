107,Alexis M.,"Hyde Park, Boston, MA",13,25,,1.0,2012-01-08,"Maybe it was just ""one of those days"" for both the kitchen and front of the house staff but.......service was BAD.  My husbands steak ordered mid rare was overcooked, I ordered mine rare and it came to me medium (I'm a line cook at a fine dining establishment on Newbury street, so believe me....I KNOW my proper temps for meat!).  We finished our first rounds of beers and left the empty bottles sitting on the edge of the table to catch the waitress's attention for a re-up and she walked by several times and didn't even look our way.  Had to nearly jump out of my seat and literally grab her to get her attention.  Our apps were forgotten about and didn't even come to the table until 3/4 way through our MAIN COURSE and the order of the app trio was still wrong after reminding her twice about which trio we ordered.  FOH management kept walking through the dining room asking people if they were satisfied (minus US for some reason!)  which is the first sign they are having trouble (that day only???) with service here in the ghetto of South Bay.  Bad time there for the second time though, so I have no hopes for the future here.  Bad location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=100,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.084,2.04

102,Carol P.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,2012-04-19,"I stopped by with my boyfriend and two other friends today and we experienced the worse customer service ever. We were seated by the host and about 20 minutes later, the waitress (I think her name was Dana) decided to come over for our orders. At this point my patience was running really low and was so close just to get up and leave. Anyways, when she came over, my boyfriend had asked her to start us up with drinks. She answered, ""I already saw you guys with drinks."" WTHeck?? Are you serious?? Did she just expected us to stick with our coffee and not to order drinks?? So I let it slide and I ordered a Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp meal with extra onions. My boyfriend and friends ordered their salad and soup without cheese. We waited another excruciating 30 minutes or more for our food. We had came around noon time. The restaurant was not even busy so this was unacceptable. I wanted to ask HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE 3 SALADS AND A MEAL ON A SHIZZLING PLATE?? So my meal came out first and I did not touch it because I wanted to wait for my friend's meals to come out too. A few moment later our waitress came back and apologize to me. She said that the meal in front of me was not suppose to be mine and wanted it back. I let her take it back to see what she would do with it. She then bought this plate that was on my table to another table for another person. DISGUSTING. I can not help but wonder if this is what the employees at applebees are trained to do.. Seriously, how can you do that to your customers? Never coming back. I rather spend a couple more bucks on Olive Garden next door.

35,Steve L.,"Providence, RI",352,536,105.0,2.0,2012-04-30,"Generic Americana, done cheaply.  At least the beer's local. Most Applebees go out of their way to turn their local franchise into a tribute to the little town they occupy.  Take the franchise in my hometown of Yuba City, CA, for example, which features display cases of yearbook photos, Yuba City High School jerseys, and other elements of local charm.  Kitschy? Yes, but probably aimed at the appropriate target audience. This Applebee's fails even that, with wall decorations featuring rapidly obsolete scenes of Red Sox and Celtics glory, but nothing in particular celebrating Dorchester, or the expansive strip mall this franchise occupies. Food is the same old mediocre Applebee's.  Steaks taste (and probably are) brined, with sirloin cuts evoking the same mouthfeel and taste of mass market Chinese beef stir fry.  I bet the beef is sourced from the same place. Overall, I felt sadness after leaving the restaurant.  I couldn't help but feel bad that a trip to Applebee's is considered a treat in many parts of this country.  I suppose that makes me a snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=40,1.72,1.72,1.72,2.44,1.7200000000000002

101,Rachael D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,,3.0,2012-06-13,"We came here because there was a wait at Olive Garden, and there was no wait at Applebee's. Now, I'd rather be at Cracker Barrel, but without one around... To start off, the host seemed surly, or maybe just mysterious. He is probably just a nice guy, but hates working at Applebee's. Who can blame him. The quick seating gave it an initial 4 stars. The atmosphere is very nice, with colourful warm tones and carpets. It is generally friendly, and we were seated in an enormous booth, with a great view of the. Olive Garden. Although the booth could have easily sat 30, we were comfortable. However, seated next to us was a loud woman. Applebee's is responsible for my broken eardrums. Onward to the meal. The boneless buffalo wings were adequately boneless. However, we ordered mild, and what we got was nothing short of fire. I survived. We ordered many things, including the Orange Crispy Chicken. The chicken was fair to good, but was sitting on a swamp of rice. I was confused, and think it must have been a mistake. The gorgonzola pecan/walnut salad was great, but a little cheese heavy. That's probably not what Olive Garden would do. The fajitas, which seemed to be the only vegetarian meal, was way oversalted. Overall, the experience was not terrible. My grandma had a shrimp dish which she said was very nice. Anyways, the dessert shooters made up for everything. My one last complaint: where are the after dinner mints like at Olive Garden?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=100,1.76,1.76,1.76,2.54,1.7600000000000002

Very helpful and when I told her that she admitted it was only her second day! Good job girl! The food was actually great. I tried the chicken wonton tacos (with no cilantro) and it was very filling and very cheap. Most appetizers are half price from 9-12pm so we got chicken quesadillas, boneless wings, and spinach and artichoke dip all half off. All were good and filling.

I had the french onion soup which had WAYYY too much greasy tasteless cheese and the oriental salad which was really nothing to write home about. My husband had tomato soup and lemon shrimp fettuccine which he felt was mediocre at best. Service was painfully slow despite being a quiet afternoon.

I ordered the appetizer plate and it was not more than ok, everything very very salty, the salt almost burning my mouth! All dishes were made with frozen products... reheated, served to a disgusting experience... While in the middle of my appetizer, another waitress came with my 2nd course - I said that I don't want it and how am I supposed to eat it while still trying to 'enjoy' my appetizer? She said ""yhmmmm"" gave me a ""wtf"" look and walked away. of course she re-circulated back with the same dish, the plate was sizzling hot, the food medium warm - fries dried out, disgusting.  I always thought you would never be able to f*ck up chicken tenders, but here we go... dry, SALTY, with a disgusting SALTY honey dijon dip on the side. I think their fries were rolled in salt after frying... and the best, my beer glass came dirty - I will never go back to that place.

We waited 30 minutes for our food(which was barely hot-- go figure!!) which means that at this point it had been about an hour of just waiting around.. while waiting though we asked the TV's which was on a snoop Dog documentary channel. We asked multiple staff members who told us they would change the channel and didn't. We finally asked for the restaurant manager-- he came by-- refused to give direct eye contact, was dismissive of our request-- and told us he needed to speak to the bartender he wasn't sure if they were able to change the channel--  he never checked back in with us-- but 10 minutes later all of the TVs in the entire restaurant portion-- not the bar were changed to NASCAR.... When i expressed my complaint to our waitress about the mangers lack of follow through she stated ""oh he's just like that""...

I asked her why it take so long she said the kitchen was backed up ..no way I took a bite of my burger it was so hot I spit it out .it was microwaved .then they left a huge mess beside us at a different table she walked past it and didn't care I had to move a high chair so someone can get by in a wheel chair they just looked at me even the waitress didn't care so sad.

My sister wanted to sit at the lounge side instead of the restaurant and at most places we go to, you get to grab any seat or 2-top and the bar/lounge server will be there to service you.... My sister and I grabbed a 2-top and as I was putting my bag down, this man (server) told us to go back to the front and someone will seat us. Alright, so I was thinking, ""new policy? new thing? I never heard of it"" And as my sister and I were walking out to the front, the woman said, ""No, you can go back in and sit down wherever...you don't need us to seat you"" RED FLAG there for me...already I was getting bad vibes.  While we were waiting for a server, we saw that gentleman half ass walking toward us and then flagging down the other server to grab our table. I THINK that they don't do sections for bar areas, but I could be mistaken. He wasn't particularly friendly to us but was busy flirting with a hightop nearby most of the time we were there.  ANYWAY, I digress....our server was named Maria, she was the sweetest! I was so happy that she was our server instead of the man from before. I ordered a burger & fries which came out quickly and was very tasty. For drinks, I ordered a Gin Martini. I definitely should have thought twice on it because it was terrible to swallow but I forced myself to drink it. Maria asked me how it was and looked so worried so I told her it was fine because she was just so nice. I had to order a Sprite to chase my martini with.

60,Sarah T.,"Boston, MA",80,2,,2.0,2016-02-24,"I didn't want to take to Yelp, but felt compelled to share our now 3 in a row negative South Bay Plaza Applebee's experiences.  I'm fully aware that Applebee's is not The Ritz, but my comments will have nothing to do with atmosphere or the food.  This restaurant is clean, spacious, and the food is good!  Prices are great.  The service and staff are what's bringing this Applebee's down.  My husband and I live in the area and Applebee's was our savior last winter during all the bad snowstorms.  We had a routine of digging out the car and heading over to Applebee's to enjoy the drink specials (how can you go wrong with a $4 house margarita/$3 Coors?) and tasty appetizers- we really had a good thing going for its convenience and price.  Consistent good food, clean, nice atmosphere.  Something must have changed over the course of the year (Staffing?  Management?) because our last 3 experiences have been frustrating.  I'd like to first share the night before Thanksgiving 2015- not a crowded night at Applebee's, plenty of staff on hand, we were quickly seated in the dining room.  After waiting at least 15 minutes for a server to come over to take our drink request, we put in an appetizer and then ordered our entrees to avoid another wait- we thought we were doing the server a favor.  Appetizer came out and my entree immediately followed, drinks brought over, though, we both asked twice for waters and never got them, but oh well.  The kicker is that my husband's entree never made it.  We both watched the server write it down and it never even came.  We waited, we drank, seeing if it would come--nope, just the check.  We weren't charged for it, so that was fine, we moved on and were over it and ready to leave. Because it's a convenient, clean restaurant for a cheap tasty meal, we went back.  Seated in the bar area this time and had the nicest, most attentive server ever.  I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shotout for doing her job and doing it wonderfully.  Things were fine.  Put our drinks in, got plenty of water, and ordered an appetizer and entrees.  Everything came out fine, except my husband got the wrong entree.  No problem, our server totally made up for it with her awesome customer service.  What really sealed the deal for us, was a recent night at Applebee's this February.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was fine, it was Friday night after all, and were seated in the dining room.  Waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, put our drinks and appetizer in.  My husband's drink came over and was in a pint glass with red lipstick on it.  Not the server's fault, but come on.  Gross.  We waited so long for those drinks!  Luckily, another one quickly made it over.  Got our appetizer, put our entrees in, and were hoping for more drinks.  But our server was nowhere to be found.  By the time he came back around, we were both over it and ready to go home, so just asked for to go boxes because we had fully digested in the amount of time it took him to come back over to us- never apologizing for the wait or even asking if we needed anything else.  The to-go boxes never made it and the server disappeared again.  When I was about to get up and ask a hostess for boxes, he conveniently came back, so we grabbed the boxes and got out of there.  I just can't take the lack of customer service here--it kills me, because we really liked this Applebee's location.  If it's understaffed on a Friday night, then that needs to be addressed by Management.  People go out to eat because they want a night off from the usual routine.  They want to relax, have drinks and food with friends/family--it's a shame to see this Applebee's go under because of the poor service.  Is it a training issue?  Why are the servers so poorly trained and inattentive?  I will also add, we always left the servers 20% tips despite their sub-par service- people have off days and I know it's a living, but we just can't take it anymore and won't be coming back.  We haven't escalated our issues to Management because by the time our servers come to our attention, we just want to leave and go home without causing a fuss.  I get it, this industry can be overwhelming, but customer service is a fundamental principal of any occupation.  End rant. Get it together, Applebee's, you can be so much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=60,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.832,2.72

It's because I didn't feel like spending 2 hours in traffic when I could kill one having dinner and still make it home at the same time. I don't remember Applebee's sucking so hard. Maybe I've only ever had fried options so I was ill-prepared. I don't know. What I do know is I would have been better off at Olive Garden. Or the Pizza Hut Express in Target... Seriously. First of all, LOL at the sticky tables because according to my experience and prior reviews, these things have been sticky for years. Apparently same with the service: came in, empty lobby, went to bar area where one server said ""sit anywhere"", so I chose a 2-Top. Then the hostess came over and said ""Oh did you just walk in (like I wasn't supposed to). Sorry I was in the bathroom do you want a menu?"" .... Yes that sounds delightfully appetizing, thanks .... Best part of the experience was Howard, my server. Best manners I've ever encountered from a server or probably otherwise. He was just a nice guy and I always appreciate politeness, so thanks, Howard! Unfortunately, the food was laughable. My $11 salad was smaller than appetizer size. It was a single layer of lettuce on a plate, with cubed chicken (like the kind in a tub at Subway or something!), lackluster ingredients, and zero appeal. I ate it slowly while reading reviews of this place and it was still gone in 5 minutes and I'm still hungry, but refuse to shell out another penny for that quality of food. Blech. So, I obviously won't be coming back -- completely based on portions and food quality. ** Note: after I finished this review, I went to the bathroom, where one server was on her cellphone texting, clearly hiding from her manager. Meanwhile the bathroom was a hot mess. Went outside to leave and two more servers were standing right outside the building smoking and using less-than professional language.

The bartender Kellee was incredibly nice and service was quick. She kept the bar clean and did a great job. That being said - the margarita was terrible. Not her fault but I couldn't even finish it. I ordered a tall glass of wine instead and got a great pour.  Ordered a few apps and was pretty disappointed in the size, presentation and taste of the food. The pretzels were falling off the plate, only got 5 tiny shrimp tossed haphazardly on the plate and just didn't taste all that great. I really wanted to enjoy this because the bartender was so good.

Then, she never stopped by our table again for the next 50 minutes, even when we pushed for the ""call server"" button after 20 minutes of waiting.  Our server literally walked around the divider in the middle of the restaurant instead of walking past our table. After she dropped off our appetizer she ran away like we had ahe plague (and we aren't even sick!). There were about 3 other servers who walked by our table and no one thought to ask if we were doing okay or went to get our server. After an hour we just paid and left.  Is it really THAT hard to just get our order? It takes like, less than a minute.. We went in being nothing but nice.

I had the brunch burger and my parents shared the Southwestern Salad. We both ordered medium rare, but everything ended up pretty well done. We had emphasized that we wanted medium rare to the guy manning the takeout counter, and he definitely put it down, I guess the kitchen just doesn't know how to cook it. The burger was good otherwise, nothing special. The steak on the southwestern salad was so extremely tough though, you had to chew for a solid minute before you could swallow it. I don't think I've ever had such a tough steak. I also got an raspberry iced tea, which I thought was regular iced tea with a flavored syrup but tasted more like the cheap Brisk tea. My father and I had a cocktail each while waiting for the takeout, he had a Myers & Tonic and I had the raspberry cosmo. He said his was good, but I couldn't taste the alcohol in mine at all.

Tasted like a standard frozen patty that is frozen with an odd shape to make it look like it was fresh. Fries heavily salted but satisfactory. In the end one of my biggest complaints was the electronic tablet menu/bill device. As far as my friend and I could tell there was no option to pay the bill in cash. We waited about five minutes for the server to return but they seemed to busy talking to members of the opposite sex.

7,Trung B.,"Boston, MA",0,46,2.0,1.0,2017-02-27,"This place is poorly ran by mgmt and I can tell staff hate to work there, but have to make their ends meet. Sat down with my family with young kids quite fast this time. Waitress Kimberley  F. served us and was quite nice and pleasant. I can see the hostess is being pushy ordering her around to clear the tables, but hello, she is serving us at the moment. She took our order and then told us that many items on the menu were out of the food, such as shrimp, kids chicken tenders, and a few entrees. Also, they were out of apple juice, which my two kids wanted. Ordered and substituted on the food selections as my kids were hungry. Food came at quite a good pace, but a little slower than what I have experienced at the Quincy Applebees. My food was dried as sh!t and I had to request gravy or some sauce just to moist my food (ordered the steak tips with mash potatoes and onion rings on top). The onion rings were not crunchy and were soaked in grease. The guests on the other table waited for more than an hour to be seated and for food to come out and they were heated and the table behind me had their orders mixed up with other patrons. First, I think mgmt needs to be retrained on how to manage a restaurant and how the kitchen functions, as when foods comes out,the servers are all taking random dishes and serving their customers. It was chaotic and unorganized restaurant/establishment. Pretty much the kitchen is hurting the servers on their performances and obviously they will be tipped less due to the unorganized kitchen. How on Earth a franchise be out of foods and not tell the servers ahead of time before customers order? This branch should be shut down due to lack of menu selections, poor kitchen quality foods, and unmanageable environment.

I understand it may be a pain in the ass to stand there and wash alllllll those dishes but when I picked up my spoon I noticed it had stains on it. It looks like they just water the utensils down and then put them back out. If you need to hire 10 people to wash and scrub dishes THEN DO IT.
