32,Andrew P.,"Douglasville, GA",2,82,14.0,1.0,2012-11-13,"It was toss up between 1 and 2 stars, but opted for the 1 because this joint has gone down hill since I last visited (and I don't come here much). I know things are going to start off bad when we walked in and saw the whole wait staff at the bar eating and act surprised when customers walk in the the door. They all scurried about like roaches with the lights turned on, a server guided us to a table and the slow service began. Drinks and the appetizer came out fast, as expected. But then there was a long lapse of waiting.... and waiting.... We had ordered salads for lunch, my friend orderd a spinach with fruit and I had fiesta chicken with tomato basil soup. It took about 30 minutes to bring out the salads. Seriously, salads. The fruits in my friend's salad were still frozen, so much for freshness. While my salad did have some flavor, it was edible but it didn't fix my appetite.  We left disappointed, stomachs half empty and hit the road looking for better eats. Whether its poor management, lack of good service or no idea how to operate a functioning restaurant... I got to say this place can go away. Its a good place for drinks, but just don't order any food that has to be prepared.

37,Honest A.,"Douglasville, GA",0,3,,1.0,2014-02-03,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to. I went to this Applebee's' on my first day staying in Douglassville. It was on a Thursday. As soon as my friend and I walked into this restaurant, music was playing with a DJ. I'm like ""you've got to be kidding me"". Why in the world is a DJ playing loud unnecessary music. I could barely hear the waiter. When I got seated, my seat was torn up. The table wasn't even cleaned properly and the food wasn't even good. Example, I bought the sliders with French fries on the side. The cooks cooked the sliders and let them get cold on my plate while the French fries were still getting ready. Cold sliders with hot fresh fries. I also ordered Mozzarella sticks and they were still cold. The only thing I enjoyed was the boneless hot wings. Other than that, everything else was terrible. The waiter even said, ""this is rachet night"". I could never see a family come into this restaurant. This Applebee's needs a new manager because he or she obviously let's the employees do whatever the heck they want. If I could go lower in rating for this place, I'd give it half a star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3?start=20,1.252,1.252,1.252,1.252,1.252
