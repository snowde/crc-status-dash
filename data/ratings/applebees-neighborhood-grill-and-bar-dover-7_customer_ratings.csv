13,Kizzy K.,"Dover, DE",0,3,,1.0,2013-11-17,Been here several times (husband likes their maple syrup blondie desert) and the food is always bad. Portions are really small and customer service is almost none existent. Don't go with a big group because your going to pay 18% for gratuity even though the service sucks. Go to TGIF instead!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
9,Tunara M.,"Washington, DC",112,36,8.0,4.0,2014-10-24,"Our waitress was very friendly and the food was actually really good! Visited from Washington DC, and there aren't too many restaurants worth going to in Dover (In my opinion).  Decided to go to this Applebee's since it was right next door to the hotel. I was very surprised! Sat at the bar which was clean and smelled fresh! Ever been to a bar/restaurant and smelled mildew?? I've had worse food at 4 Star restaurants in DC and Baltimore. I definitely recommend this restaurant. I also ordered a few margaritas which were delicious :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
11,Lorna M.,"Fairview Heights, IL",0,26,,2.0,2015-06-22,Nothing good about this Applebee's. Just mediocre. Service was a bit haphazard but not awful.  The food just wasn't good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
5,Amy Marchand C.,"Johnston, RI",85,4,,1.0,2015-07-04,"Wow. I've eaten at Applebee's before and even at this location on past trips. I've  usually liked the food and experience. Not tonight. Granted it was a holiday, but both I and my companion had to send our food back. His steak was under-cooked and the fries had seasoning, despite clearly asking for ""no seasoning."" My salmon was raw in the middle -- twice! When I got it back the second time it tasted like it had been thrown in the microwave. Tough, tasteless and over cooked.  A disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
7,Summer B.,"Baltimore, MD",240,193,1394.0,4.0,2015-08-08,This was our first time here and the customer service and the food was very good. The drinks were awesome and words cannot describe just how delicious my Apple Sangria was. Just the right amount of everything despite the not so positive reviews. Brittany our server was awesome she gave great customer service and a great smile to add. Applebee's was a great way to finish our day at Dover Downs in Delaware.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
12,Jeff M.,"Ridgely, MD",0,4,,1.0,2015-11-16,Went to the Dover Delaware location on 11-16-15 for supper. We were seated as soon as we walked in the door however that is when the service fell apart. Had 4 members of the wait staff walk by the table not one of them stopped. One girl even delivered a drink  order to the table right next to us still no service not even for drinks after 6 mins of this I left. There was no excuse for the the waiter not to show up they weren't even busy.  So we went the the Camden Applebee's and received excellent service even though  this location had more customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
8,Ashley D.,"Dover, DE",31,20,39.0,2.0,2016-05-16,"This Applebees appeared very tidy, and my friend and I were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waitress wasn't as friendly or helpful as we expected...my friend has severe food allergies and when we questioned our waitress about items on the menu, she was flustered and not very helpful. ..she also didn't go ask the chef to be certain. For our lunch, my friend and I tried the appetizer deal,  3 for $13; this was actually a good deal. Getting one of those appetizers alone  would have costed around $8. We got the pretzel and beer cheese dip, spinach and artichoke dip, and the sriracha shrimp. All were pretty good. For my main dish, I had a classic burger. I was under the impression that when you go to an actual restaurant and order a burger, it would include lettuce and tomatoes and maybe onions and mayo. Nope. Paid $7 for literally a hunk of meat with cheese on a bun. It didn't seem fresh either. ..tasted like carnival food that was frozen and reheated. I was extremely disappointed. On top of that I ordered onion rings in place of the fries. ..and they were really dry and overcooked. This isn't the normal Applebees I usually go to, which is for a good reason. I won't be back because clearly this one at least is still charging the same amounts for low quality entrees. The only saving grace was the appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
6,Brenda B.,"Magnolia, DE",37,47,61.0,4.0,2016-07-02,Love the French onion soup.  The pecan crusted  chicken salad is my favorite go to.  I am never disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
1,Aleisha H.,"Dover, DE",78,205,492.0,4.0,2016-09-03,"This is a solid Applebee's location.  The location looks like any other Applebee's.  The customer service stands them out of the crowd.  They have great service from the time you enter to the time you exit.  They greet you when you enter and say goodbye when you exit.  Most of the staff are friendly and have smiles.  We have eaten here quite a few times and have not ever had a bad experience.   The menu is the menu and the food is generally good.  You are not coming to Applebee's for a gourmet meal, however you will get a good meal. That is served in ample time.   This location has 1/2 priced apps after 9 pm.  This is great for the young kids that attend the local colleges.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
10,Natasha G.,"Dover, DE",22,1,,1.0,2016-09-05,"I stopped in with my son for an early dinner. We were seated immediately. We waited at least 20 minutes for our server.  It was not busy, there were a lot of empty tables. Another server came by and said our server would be right out. If my son wasn't so hungry I would have left but I stayed.  Approximately 10 minutes later our server came to our table.  There was no apology for the wait.  She took our drink orders and asked if we needed extra time for our dinner order... In my head I was like ""Lady you're kidding right?"" I told her we were ready to order. I ordered soup and the cheese potatoes, no bacon. My son ordered Boneless wings and fries.  After another 25 minutes our meals came out. When I touched my bowl I could feel stuff all over the outside of it like it wasn't washed.  I looked at it and it definitely was dirty. The plate the bowl was  rested on was dirty too.  I examined my potatoes and they looked fine. So I took a bite.  They weren't even hot. I was not pleased at all. My son's meal was fine. I waited for the waitress and told her about my meal. She apologized and stated she would notify the Manager and see if he would take it off of my bill. When my son finished eating she brought the bill minus my half of the meal and said we could use the table top device to check out. Let me say thing the device was just as dirty as the outside of the soup bowl! I was ready to go.  I paid the bill and left. The manager didn't even come to our table before we left. Which is customary for Applebee's. I never go to a chain restaurant expecting top notch service but come on! I promise this will be the last time I patronize the Applebee's in Dover Delaware. They need to get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
2,Tim B.,"Charlotte, NC",52,177,80.0,4.0,2016-11-14,"Wow...Applebee's.  I was here for a great event....my Mom's birthday.  We had a short wait time as everyone was not available for seating.  Typical chain-restaurant procedure I guess.  Well we had about 16-20 in our party.  Service was very good.  The appetizers were good....spinach dip, buffalo wings and salads.  The waiter was able to handle all of our party and even pulled in 2 additional tables for the unexpected arrivals!!!  My ""oriental chicken salad"" was good. It came with a sweet honey vinaigrette.  I had to switch out for a simple oil and vinegar because it was way too sweet.  I was surprised how calm and quiet the restaurants was on a Sat afternoon.  As it turned out...most folks may have been at other places...lots of restaurants to select.  Applebee's was a decent choice on this special birthday lunch for Mom.  And she was happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
3,Brian B.,"Little Creek, DE",4,23,23.0,2.0,2016-11-27,Just tried their two for $12.49 deal. The lime chicken wasn't bad. The Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi taste like a bowl of water! Horrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
4,Rich M.,"Sykesville, MD",0,12,,2.0,2017-06-23,"The service was acceptable.  Then place could use a little housekeeping.  The floors both in the entrance and the restaurant were littered.  The food was just acceptable, which we could have gotten at a fast food place for a lot less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
0,K W.,"Dover, DE",0,4,,5.0,2017-10-21,"Dined on a Saturday night, very busy but not yet on a wait.  Manager assisted the hosts greeting, seating and helped clear tables.  Our server was outstanding, Cam w., he checked on us frequently and overall the service was excellent.  We ordered 2 for 20, entrees and appetizer were cooked perfect and taste was great.  We also ordered draft beer and a signature cocktail, both excellent.  The service from the Manager and server was excellent, food was great and we will be back.  Thank you for a great night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dover-7,,,,,
