I had personally never been here on a busy weekend evening so I can't fault the servers for that. place was packed. I actually never realized that applebee's is like ""a night out on the town"" for some people... for me its either fast food or fine dining... anyway! Server 'Colleen' was less than attentive. when we were first seated she didn't greet us warmly. just a shrug and ""Get you anything?"" we said...""water would be nice!"" .... 'kay, she walks off... Next time 'round we order are food/drinks... a moment later she appears with the margaritas. ""OK who had the one on the rocks?"" Neither. We both ordered frozen 'ritas (1) raspberry (1) strawberry. She goes ""U sure?"" UMM.... YEAH... My friend: ""Me too"" ...okay, well let me see if the bartender screwed up.  (Really, its the bartender's fault?) also no apology. Just a shrug. Comes back 'bout 10 minutes later and has to ask us again to taste test 'cause she's not sure which is which 'cause ""they look kinda similar"" REALLY?! You're the server. Before I make this review into a short e-book... service was terrible. She would forget something about every other request. I want a side of blue cheese (check) my friend wants side of ranch (forgot)... her expression stayed the same the whole time!!! NO SMILE..   Great poker face baby, but this ain't Vegas... In the end we asked her to split our check ""Sure! BRB"" ... couldn't even get that right. My friend has both the 'ritas on her bill...which actually should have been mine. We didn't tip very well as expected...and as I say here on Yelp, I am a service over product girl. No excuse for bad service.  I could've at least gotten a smile.......

I don't know if this is typical in all Applebees but this location does not have a hostess waiting for you at the entrance.  We come in, wait for the hostess to see us from the bar area and then are seated.  It's typical to have 3-4 groups come in and wait for the hostess alone.  This holds true, even when it's not busy.  Good luck getting your drinks refilled.

We had a party of ten on a sunday night, but luckily was seated right away because the place was pretty much dead. We ordered our food almost right away since we already knew what we wanted. It took them over 35 minutes to bring out our appetizers. They actually forgot our buffalo wings, so after bringing it to their attention, they brought it out after they brought out our entrees. I ordered the 9oz sirloin with loaded mash and fries. The portions were very generous compared to the other applebees I've been to. My steak was a bit on the salty side so I needed extra sauce with my meat. A couple of my friends did some substitutions for their side but didn't receive what they ordered, which I find weird. Didn't you write everything down? During our whole meal, no one stopped by to check if we needed anything or if everything was ok. We would have to flag them down while they rushed by to even get a refill. Overall, stars for my own food, mostly because of the portions. Negatives: service..

It was my first time ever at Applebees ( chain restaurants with names like Applebees or Mimi's or anything like that just never appealed to me )  We were seated pretty quickly, but it took them sooo long to take our order.  Half the time the waiters / waitresses were just sitting on the bar and talking to each other...  They didn't have very good communication with each other either, because they waitress would keep on saying I will get your server for you etc. etc. but then she would just end up taking our order.  I hate when people do that... if you are so unorganized try to at least hide this from your patrons.   We ordered the fried green beans, buffalo bites, and wonton chicken tacos.   The fried green beans are delicious !!! Too bad they only come with like 15. The sauces they came with ( a horseradish dip & a more vinaigrette type of dip) did not taste very good to me, but my friends liked them. The green beans were salty enough to me anyways that I didn't need dip.  Be forewarned this dish is 920 CALORIES. really? where do these calories come from.??  Buffalo bites were really vinagrey and not spicy at all even though we ordered spicy meh..  The wonton chicken tacos looked really good on the menu, but they looked so lonely and sad on the plate.  They are really small, and not really worth the price.

We do the happy hour special after 9, plenty of booth seating, nice family atmosphere, clean and looks good.

We get the sliders and mozzarella sticks which came out nice with great presenation. Burgers cooked perfectly then again they make em at all applebees good, my fav. We then ask for another round of mango margs, we get it back, no salt, no lime, and ...no alchohal! Big no for me. I had to take off a star for that.

I ordered a water with lemon to drink which I normally order everywhere. The water tasted like dirt. Both my Grandfather and I ordered salads and both of us ended up with food poisoning. My daughter had mac and cheese and an Oreo shake and was the only one that didn't get sick.  I can't remember ever being so sick to my stomach in my life. When I found out the next morning Grandpa was sick too I decided I needed to call and let Applebee's know how ill I was and was still feeling. The Shift Manager that I spoke to was nice and said that she would look into it and make sure GM knew as well. Not sure if she passed it on., She did also offer me a free meal next time. The last thing somebody that has been ill for the last day and a half from eating at your restaurant wants to do is eat there ever again. Overall the place was dirty, service was mediocre, and the food was decent tasting but toxic. I hope that by me calling them and posting this that it will keep other people from feeling as ill from food poisoning as me and my Grandpa did. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

We order the following:  * Chicken Won Ton Tacos (bland) * Beef Sliders (dry, looked like it was slapped together cause the cheese was not even melted all the way) * Fried Green Beans (madd salty! You could literally see the grains of excess salt on the plate!) *Cherry Limeade *Strawberry Limeade (I've had better) The food was horrible! Definitely not worth the price we paid. But we were so famished and tired from being on the road all day we succumbed to just scarfing it.    Drinks took almost 10 minutes. Food took about another 15.  Someone else brought our food. I wanted to see how long it would before he noticed we were done, cause he sure was making sure everyone around us was accommodated to their liking (the entire restaurant was slow, as in not busy.) We waited patiently for 15 minutes for the check. Our server never came out. I had to literaly had to get off my chair and flag him down. When he finally got the check, these were his exact words, ""Here ya go"" and walked off. NO ""Thank You"" or ""How was everything?""  For the record we are very generous tippers. I could deal with the bad food, but bad service is just un-acceptable!! Our server got what he deserved: a whole bunch of nothing! Gave exact change and left.  It's ironic that my review is from 4/17/13.. yet reading the last 3 recent reviews (8/1/13) the rating is 1 star and the horrible service is the only thing that seems to be consistent.

First of all, the restaurant was basically empty and yet we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress seemed genuinely miserable to be serving us. We ordered the 2 for 20 deal, which came with a lot of food, which was good for the price we paid. The problem is, the mac and cheese that my friend ordered had bacon in it (he can't eat bacon because of his religion). There was no information on the menu that said that the meal would come with bacon, they just put it on without asking. I found that to be pretty insensitive, the waitress should have asked first instead of making assumptions. When my friend explained that he couldn't eat bacon, the waitress told him to order something different on the menu. I kept asking why he couldn't just have the same mac and cheese, only without the bacon sprinkled on. She explained that she couldn't do that because ""it just came with bacon""... I literally don't think she comprehended a word I was saying. Anyways, my friend ended up ordering some food that he didn't even want.

It exceeded my expectations for an Applebee's burger... not sure what I was expecting.  Never ordered one before this night. I replaced my fries with a ceasar salad. No extra charge thank you. And even tho our waiter wasn't in the best mood (he looked really tired) he still did his job and he did it in a timely manner. People make mistakes. I'm not docking points for an incorrect order especially when it was deliciously fixed. Other than that the atmosphere was great. The hostesses that greeted and seated us were very outgoing so it helped put a good vibe on the meal to start.

Then it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order but we ordered as well just in case he didn't come back for another 15 minutes.  After we ordered it took over 40-45 minutes for our food to come. We asked him to check a while before but it still took a while. I told out server to at least bring out some free appetizers or something since it was taking so long. He never brought anything out.  After being served it took another 30 minutes for him to even check in on us. So I just asked for the check because I wanted to get the hell outta there.

Let me begin when me and my PREGNANT wife drove all the way to pick up a baby crib to Costco from South San Jose because San Jose ran out and the only one available was on the Tri-Valley. My PREGNANT wife and I had not ate because we were trying to beat Costco closing time. In our way back we decided to stop at this Applebee's Biggest mistake of my life!!!!! . When me and my PREGNANT wife were seated the hostess took our drink order and got us our drink.. After 20mins seating down nobody had check on us and I asked the hostess if someone was going to take our order. She said that the waiter had probably forgot about us because they were super ""busy"" BUSY!!!!! that place was half empty!!!!! Then the Manager came took our order. Food took 40 mins to come out. Our food was cold and your should of seen my ""Steak"" it looked like a meatball.  The hostess were rude and lazy!!!! There was 3 hostess in the front just chit chatting!!!! If the waiter was so busy they should of helped him with orders instead of walking back and fourth just chit chatting!!!!! Then when we were eating nobody ever checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Hostess and waiter would just walk back and fourth. I would try to make eye contact to ask for help but once they would see me they would turned the other way!!!!! Once we finished eating I put  my debit card on the side of the table to pay and get the hell out of their. No bill was ever brought for another 15mins finally I called someone and told them to charge my card because I had to leave ASAP manager came out apologized and said meal was on them because we never saw a waiter. I guess they saw my pregnant wife and I were annoyed. I give the manager 5 stars for handling the situation right. But she needs to put her crew on check or trained them a bit better.  Also people behind us were annoyed. They went off on one of the hostess and some guy kept on chasing them around the restaurant for service.

Four salads, a burger and a kids burger. Simple enough? Food comes out one salad short. The waiter and host do not even pay attention that one salad is missing. A couple minutes go by before our waitress comes by to check and make sure we are okay. I tell her my salad is missing and she proceeds to tell me I'll fix it. After a half hour of waiting for my salad ( I saw personally three salads that I ordered go passed to other tables) and everyone else finishing their meals I still did not have mine. Me and my wife ordered waters to go with our drinks, took three times of asking to finally get one. We ordered a mango lemonade for my daughter (age six, this comes into play in a minute) and my wife. The waitress brought out mango iced tea to both my wife and daughter. More went wrong but I think this gives you an idea. Probably not typical but was just ridiculous. After hearing ""we just had a cook walk out"" and ""yes it should of been put to the front of the line but it didn't"" I got frustrated. All I asked for politely was to cancel my salad and give me the check. I did not need to hear any sob stories or what can we do to make this up?

The veggies were so overcooked that I couldn't lift them with a fork.  Another minute and they would have been soup. I think they were from a previous day. The House Sirloin was small, dry, overcooked and full of gristle.  I left more than half on the plate. The ""sauteed"" mushrooms were either raw or burnt, depending on the bite. I got only a fork with my salad but the lettuce was chopped so coarsely I couldn't fit it in my mouth. When the steak arrived, I only got a knife and had to rescue the salad fork to eat. Roundly ignored by all the wait staff when I wanted water, or utensils, or more tea,  I should have been more mindful of the empty parking lot. Obviously the locals have caught on. There were only seven people at tables when I arrived on a Friday evening -- and then I saw that three of the seven were actually waiters watching TV because there was nothing to do.  The wait staff out-numbered the clients while I was there.

180,Jaime S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,6,,2.0,2014-11-09,"Applebee's as a chain is alright... There's something for everyone, the Happy Hour is awesome, it's cheap, and they do have a few dishes I often find myself craving.  This particular Applebee's however, needs a lot of work. The service is SLOW.  I've been in there a few times over the last year and almost ever time I have been appalled by how painfully slow the service is.  (And I was a server for over 6 years so I am usually one to make excuses for slow service, knowing all the variables that can be the cause. ).  One time when I was in there we ordered. 2-for-20.  The way this works is that two people order one appetizer to share, and each order one entree, and share the $20 check.  (Amazing deal by the way!) usually the appetizer is quick and comes out within ten minutes and the entrees follow about 10-15 minutes after that.  On this particular night my boyfriend and I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip for the app, he ordered a pasta dish with chicken, and I order the napa chicken dish (yum!).  Now, I know for a fact that the spinach and artichoke dip takes about 5 to 8 minutes to prepare (it's pre-portioned and microwaved/broiled once ordered.) When our dip didn't come after 15 minutes I figured ""ok maybe they had to defrost some frozen dip and fry some new tortilla chips."" (This at most would have taken 20 minutes.). We sat patiently and didn't even whine.  It was about 25 minutes before I finally had to call over our server and ask what the holdup was.  He said he wasn't sure and would check on it. (No apology.) A few minutes later he said ""the kitchen is working in it"" and walked away again. (Still no apology!) Ten more minutes pass (at this point it has been over 45 minutes since we ordered and not even our 5-minute app has arrived.) The server was about to take his 5th trip passed us without saying anything when I finally stopped him as said ""listen, even if our dip is still not ready, can you bring out entrees as soon as they are ready? We are pretty hungry.""  Sure enough he comes right out with our entrees! They were scorching hot and the sauce on my BF's pasta had started to harden.  The plates had clearly been sitting in the hot window for at least 15 minutes.  Finally I asked to talk with a manager.  The only excuse they had for the slow service was that ""all the cooks were on break.""  Sorry... But I've never heard of a restaurant that allows all of their line cooks to take their breaks at the same time in the middle of a dinner shift!  I didn't even put up a fight I was so over it.  Our dip came out eventually but there was literally no explanation for the wait other than the lack of cooks in the kitchen.  The manager didn't even offer to comp our app... Just offered a ""free"" desert Shooter (which only cost $3) Bad form Applebee's.   Anyway, the moral of the story is avoid this location if you can, and if you can't...

Finally our table was ready and we were seated, had to wait a good 10 mins until our waiter arrived, by far the most rude waiter I have experienced, we wanted to order another round of beers and there were still drinks that we carried over from the bar, so he asked us if he could see our ideas, we joked that we just got drinks at the bar, and he angrily told us ""well I didnt check your ideas here, so I need to see it"".  after that i knew this guy gonna be a pain, and then he took our orders and wanted to read the order back to us, he barked at us to quiet down so he could read it back to us. So unprofessional! The food came and it wasnt fantastic pasta was cold, steak was overcooked. Asking him to for more refills or Ranch or napkins, was such a task for him. Not sure if he should be in this industry. Finally our bill arrived after we asked for it about 6 times,  we wanted to split the check evenly with credit cards, when we told him he told us we made his job that much harder!  umm i'm sorry, maybe you shouldn't  be working here lol!  First and last time coming to this Applebee's should have read the reviews before we decided to come here yesterday!

Option (1) speak into a speaker box and drive up to the second window and get your dinner wrapped in paper or in a box. Option (2) Get insulted by the Naan Nazi's at Shalimar Option (3) Go to Dublin and choose from Lazy Dog Restaurant 40 min wait Option (4) Go to Applebee's no wait open till 1 am across the shopping center from Lazy Dog Restaurant. Wound up with option 4. It was the Pre-Yelp for me since the last time I had set foot into Applebee's and it was as if time stopped and it was eerily familiar. We were seated right away even though the place was relatively busy. (must be the millions well spent on advertisements). We were given two menus each along with the drink menu and the dessert menus as well a electronic tablet on the table. The tablet was on the blink until our server changed the battery pack.  We looked at the drink options and ordered the mango lemonade and the Corona Rita with a Tequila Casedores Reposado upgrade option for $1 more. The drinks were excellent and the highlight of the meal. plus stars Food choices for the night were : Chips and Salsa Shredded Pork Nachos Crosscut BBQ ribs Chicken tortilla soup.  All off the pub menu choice of three items smaller plates $12.95.  All were equaling BAD! The Chicken Tortilla Soup which per the server was newly made but came last was terrible. The Cross Cut Ribs still had cuts of bone and grissle from the band saw used to cross cut the rib.  Minus stars Service was good. And with the new tablet you can pay and get out fast.

It always took so long to get the attention of the waitress who seemed irritated to even be there. I dont remember her name but she was in her 30s maybe early 40's, black hair pulled back in a ponytail. I cant speak for every server there but she needs to find a new gig. We got our food (ribs) and got the honey bbq ones. They were surprisingly spicy despite sounding like they would be sweet. After returning them for another item were explained that the rub used on all the ribs ""has some kick to it"". If this was the case it should be mentioned in the menu clearly. For arguments sake maybe we are just spicy food wimps and couldn't handle it. We certainly felt that way and felt even worse asking for another order but we simply couldn't eat it (we never like to be ""that guy""). The manager came out (a blonde girl) and she was nice. They almost got a save for this move despite the long wait for our food and lack of attention the whole time....Then I waited 30 mins between finishing my food and getting my check.... My dimwitted waitress up and disappeared and my 2 year old went berserk for 20 minutes. I'm surprised nobody helped us if for no other reason to get our screaming child out of the restaurant.

Bartender who served us did an okay job. Not the best, but she managed to help a few people and maybe she could have asked the other girls for help.

I stopped coming to this Applebee's for almost a year due to numerous awful experiences, including the incredibly rude staff that just ignores you and the continual mistakes made with both my and my husband's orders. Unfortunately they closed both the Livermore and San Ramon locations, so last night I decided to give the Dublin Applebee's ONE last chance. And just as I thought, big mistake. The same older waitress that has been there for forever was there with her same rude, bitter attitude as always. That is not acceptable behavior for how you treat any customer. Months ago, the last time I was in, I left a note on the receipt about the poor service from our waitress Mercedes, and last night when we went in she didn't even apologize, but instead all she said was ""Wow I haven't seen you guys in awhile, thanks for your note last time"" and continuously kept glaring at us the entire time, acting extremely childish and immature.

We were seated at a booth right away and our waitress came by to take our drink orders. She was friendly and patient to make sure she got our orders correct. She gave us enough time to pick out our dinner options from the menu and when my mom and I picked out two dishes that were also on the 2 for $20 menu (that we were not aware of), she told us about that option and how we could order an appetizer along with it. We went with that and got the rest of our table's orders in too. The restaurant was picking up, so we waited a little bit longer than expected for our food to arrive, but it came out hot and perfect to how we ordered it.

As we got seated, I saw our waiter look at our table and roll his eyes. He probably thought we weren't going to tip him well, because we were a lot younger than the rest of the clientele. He literally acted like we just killed his dog, and he was now forced to serve us! It was bizarre! So my boyfriend asked for a Long Island, and was immediately carded. The waiter looked at his I.d. and laughed and told him he couldn't accept if because one corner was broken off. (All information was intact as well as the magnetic strip.) We asked him if he could ask a manager, being that it was my boyfriend's birthday. Again he rolled his eyes and stomped to the back like a two year old put in time-out. He came back 30 seconds later and told us that his manager wouldn't take it either, with an evil smirk. So my boyfriend just took his I.d. back and excused himself to use the restroom. One of our friends then tried to order a drink, and asked POLITELY what brands of whiskey they offered there. The waiter ROLLED HIS EYES and tapped his pen on his pad and responded, ""*SIGH* Well, what are you looking for?"" At this point, I was shaking and was about to smack a grown man in the face. Instead, I just calmly asked another waiter if I could speak to the manager. Literally a full 5 minutes goes by and not one ""manager"" came to our table. So we just ended up leaving, because we didn't want to create a scene. I just want to say that I find it crazy that people are still so prejudiced!!

Hostess was more worried about the party for her 21st birthday the night before than the guest and the way ahe talked was not normal. Waitress was slow on getting orders. She brought out our salads but it took another 5 minutes and having to get her to have something to eat it with. Finally got the food and my chicken was burnt but wasn't going to wait even longer. And to pay for the food.... We never saw our server again even after waiting 10 minutes to pay. Good thing we were paying cash or I think we would have just walked out on it.

First thing she does after we sit is ask the waiter if he ""wants us"". He said something along the lines of this table being somebody else's responsible.

It's pretty sad and pathetic!  So my husband and I come in on a Monday afternoon, and it was pretty slow. So there was no one at the host station which was fine and made sense since it seemed slow. Then a sweet waitress with her hands full sees us and immediately puts her plates down and seats, and she was super kind and had excellent customer service skills!  However it was our wack waiter, he was arrogant and stuck up! I felt like we were getting punk' or something...it was very clear he didn't want to be there and our presence annoyed him!  First of all he didn't make eye contact with us at all and he seemed irritated he had to serve us. When he brings us our drinks, I told him we would like to order an appetizer, and he just stared at me and I was like ookkk, can I please have chips and dip please. He just wrote it down and walked away! It was so weird! I never meant a waiter where I felt like I was talking to myself and basically asking myself questions! So when he finally brought the dip it was horribly too salty and the salsa was blank and gross!  However, I would like to add our main entrees were pretty decent because my steak and shrimp were pretty darn good! But My husband ordered the quesadilla burger and it was sadly soggy. Finally we ordered the brownie bites and that was pretty good too.  Also I was considering speaking to the manager about the lack of customer service our waiter had, but when I saw her dancing to the music and signing and hanging out with her employees I figured what the point was if the standard seemed low and she didn't seem to care since it was her hangout time in front of the customers!  Lastly, he brought us our check and didn't even offer us if we wanted something else like dessert?! When he came and brought us our dessert he sort of threw it on the table. My husband was real irritated with this guy and so was I! Like what's the point of you working here and trying to serve us?! This place seriously needs a reality check and is not just some random bar that is a hangout spot!  Sorry this is the last time we will be coming back here and everyone else should run too! Not unless your desperately hungry and there is no other choice! Trust me people this is a last resort!

My husband and I stopped in real quick for just some appetizers and it took almost an hour from start to finish. I understand if the kitchen is backed up it might take a little while but the place was hardly busy. Our server seemed to be in his own world wandering around the place aimlessly. He actually forgot to bring us water! I made eye contact with him and that seemed to remind him. Than another 10 minutes for a cherry limeade that not only had a gnat floating on top but was half melted leading me to believe that it was sitting around for a little while before he brought it over to us. Food finally came out and my salad had cheese even though I asked for none. Too hungry to wait for a new one so ate it anyways. Asked for more sour cream and had to remind him two more times before actually receiving it. He actually walked over to us midway through our meal with a burger asking if that was ours. Were his customers! How does he not know that we didn't order a burger!? Every table of his seemed irritated and I certainly don't blame them. Never in my life have I left a 10% tip and even that felt like too much.

We stumbled into the restaurant shortly before the evening rush on a Friday night.   We were quickly greeted and seated.  While we were given traditional paper menus, we found that Applebee's has fully leveraged an electronic tableside ordering system via a tablet.   And hence the waitstaff has probably been cut by at least 50% as everything from food orders to payment to hailing down help from the staff is dependent on the tablet.  Applebee's has certainly done well in implementing the technology, but there is still a desire to have human interaction behind a friendly smile.   Once our food order was placed through the tablet, it did not take long before the food arrived. Aside from a minor oversight from the kitchen, everything was prepared hot and as stated in the menu.    There are no complaints as far as flavors and serving sizes as everything was prepared satisfactorily.  For the price paid (especially the 2 for $20 meal deal with one shareable appetizer and two entrees), one can't really expect too much.   All in all, Applebee's deserves a solid 2.5 stars (rounded up) middle of the road rating.   It couldn't be too bad judging by a packed restaurant and full waiting area of eager diners as we exited at the end of our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6,2.04,2.06,2.06,,2.052
