20,Doc S.,"St Paul, TX",23,34,,2.0,2012-01-07,The waitress was very nice. The cheese sticks were good. The steak was one of the worse I have ever had. It was a cheap piece of meat and terribly cooked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3?start=20,,,,,
21,Melonie H.,"Richardton, ND",0,14,,1.0,2012-12-02,"Hostess was nice. Waitress was not good. Took forever for her to come back to take our drink order after I got back from washing my hands. When she came, I was still undecided so she abruptly said she'd give us more time. She quickly left, came back to another table took their order and then put it in. Then came back and we ordered water for us and 2 kids sprites half full. She repeated the sprites and rudely said ' you want small sprites AND half full'? Yes. She brought them 3/4 full. We ordered and I was undecided still. I ordered a salad and husband ordered a steak. I changed my mind and had to get the hostess to find the waitress. I debated changing it because of her attitude but I tested her. She failed. The sliders I ordered, rolls were burnt but meat was juicy. The steak was overlooked but tasty. Tortilla soup was good. We asked for a side of ranch and an extra plate, brought out a icy cold plate with ranch dish. (Extra plate was for hot food, as our kids are small and don't eat much so we share.  Food was brought hot, she quickly left and didn't come back until food was 1/2 gone. Just poor service all around. I wouldn't have left her a tip but husband felt like being nice so I didn't push it. Lol Restaurant was dirty, floors needed sweeping and could tell they're working in it but lots of employees standing around. Bathroom was clean but not clearly signed.  Food was good overall but service was just lousy. If I were drinking alcohol I may not have minded but dining with kids, I expect better service!  We should've hit up the Mexican restaurant down the street that was recommended to us by a local. :-/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3?start=20,,,,,
19,Brenda P.,"Aurora, CO",33,191,28.0,3.0,2013-07-12,"My family lives near Durango, and this is one of my Dad's favorite restaurants. I guess it is the large variety on their menu. The food is fine, but nothing special. If you want consistent food quality, and affordable pricing, this is your place. If you want something special, visit one of the many upscale restaurants in the Durango area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
22,Yelp S.,"Boulder, CO",0,17,,4.0,2013-12-31,"Honestly, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Durango. It's very professional for a town like this, the waitresses are nice, and it's a good value. It's way better than the Denny's yet about the same price. They have some delicious cheap deserts and the 1/2 price happy hour appetizers are good too. I'm looking forward to my next meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3?start=20,,,,,
18,SM N.,"Rigby, ID",2,14,,5.0,2015-08-25,I was here with lots of family and could not have asked for better service.  There were 16 of us and any complaint had was minor.  They even had a few GF options and did not seem to be put out by the allergy.  Drinks were never empty...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
11,Mick M.,"Cortez, CO",0,30,9.0,2.0,2015-09-17,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in Durango.  We ate there about twice a month when in town.  The food has steadily declined in the last ten years.  The menu changes more often than I change clothes.  Many of our favorites have disappeared.  Portion size and ingredients change with each visit.  Half a cup of soup instead of a more full one. Coleslaw that tastes like shredded cabbage served plain.  When i tell them to hold the slaw, they serve some equally disgusting cucumbers slices marinated in what tastes like Dave's Insanity Sauce.  The lime chicken my wife ordered did not taste of lime, the chicken had cheese on it which was heated so much it nearly all ran off the chicken.  The rice looked like it was made a week before we arrived.  They take your drink glass for a refill and come back way later when you have finished your meal. We will find another place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
15,Lilah G.,"Durango, CO",0,48,16.0,1.0,2016-01-12,"Even for an Applebees it's bad, food is dry and so obviously crappy made, they don't even try to hide it. They served me burnt ribs and messed up my boyfriends order the only time we ever went to eat there (it was our first and certainly last meal there) They didn't offer us a discount or anything after screwing up his order and burning mine (and when I say burnt, I mean really burnt, I was basically eating ashes) PLEASE if your visiting Durango, or live here, do not support this shoddy low quality chain restaurant, Durango has so many amazing and well priced LOCAL restaurants, choose one of them instead of opting for the dingy familiarity of an Applebees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
14,Collin H.,"Durango, CO",92,7,,5.0,2016-01-19,"Such a great restaurant the service was top notch 10/10 would recommend especially the host David he got us the best seat in the house, UNREAL! Oreo milkshakes were a little too thick but that was no damper on a wonderful night out with the family. I'll definitely be back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
17,Martinez A.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,1.0,2016-02-14,"This has to be the worst Applebee's ever. Service and food are both way under par. We waited 15 minutes before we flagged down a ""manager"" who when we told we had Been waiting 15 minutes he said our server was busy helping someone else (WHAT!??!). Food was horrible, steaks and potatoes we cold. If your in Durango opt out and go to the Denny's across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
10,Jill B.,"Morrison, CO",0,11,,1.0,2016-04-01,Overpriced for small portions and subpar food. The margarita was small and made in a sloppy manner. Tartar sauce was a weird ranchy sauce and the cole slaw had cilantro in it. They have these game tablets on each table. BEWARE. The waiter tried to charge us $1.99 for using a tablet that didn't work until we were done with the meal. We were also not advised of this charge. The waiter also insisted that the juices listed in the kids' menu meals were not part of the meal even though there was no upcharge price stated in the menu. He claimed that the meal only came with milk or water. I will never go back to any Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
7,Christian F.,"Pagosa Springs, CO",0,2,,1.0,2016-05-08,I wish I could give zero stars. We visited this location and waited 35 minutes for a table. There was a table waiting for us it just needed cleaned. We sat as we watched to people clean a small table and then both went out to smoke on a busy mothers day during lunch. RIDICULOUS. Food was mediocre drinks were over priced and our waitress was absolutely terrible. We had to grab her for more drinks. We will never return to another applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
13,Judy E.,"Durango, CO",0,3,,1.0,2016-06-26,Not impressed fries were stale and cold chicken was ok but not great service was slow,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
12,Debbie Y.,"Fort Collins, CO",11,15,,1.0,2016-06-28,"I would do zero stars if it was an option.  Waited for the hostess to clean offf a table even thou there were several empty tables.   Waited, waited for someone to take our order.  I was ready to get up and leVe and finally someone came.  She said she was just helping out.  Ordered 2 drinks and the $13 appetizer plate.   Waited, waited for drinks to arrive.  My margarita came.  Trouble with the beer. Need to wait foamy, waiter came back oh they know the problem just changed kegs.  Hubby ordered a different beer.  Told the waiter the experience wasn't very good.   Manager on duty came over explained it to him. He said he wanted to fix it for us.   He gave us a big 10% off the $13.00 appetizer, a whopping $1.30 for their sucky service.  I tell you it was a slap in the face.  Will never ever go here again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
8,Ad D.,"Durango, CO",43,9,1.0,1.0,2016-07-24,Went to the Durango Applebee's looking for a steak sandwich.  They serve nothing like that.  They give you a menu that has a whole page of drinks and desserts WITHOUT any pricing on it!!! What kind of restaurant is this?? They seat you at a table with a broken computer.......pretty pitiful!!!  This would be a great place to open a restaurant!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
5,Ross B.,"Irvine, CA",107,16,10.0,1.0,2016-08-07,"I have never left a review on yelp for a restaurant. But I wanted to do my best to prevent anyone from going there. We were not greeted on arrival, and our table was messy when they walked us to it. Our server was rude, unprofessional, and forgetful. My""12oz butcher's choice steak"" was probably 80% fat and the baked potato tasted a week old. Steak was cooked horribly and not to my asking. They were pissed when I asked them to cook it more. First and last time I go to any Applebees, thanks to this experience. What a ripoff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
9,Anita J.,"Bryson City, NC",20,2,,5.0,2016-08-18,"Good food, good service! I had the grilled salmon. It was cooked to perfection.  My husband enjoyed his steak, which was juicy and tender.

16,Carol Ann D.,"Tewksbury, MA",5,10,1.0,1.0,2016-10-04,"Went here for supper while visiting Durango a few weeks ago on a month long cross country trip. Worst restaurant we came across during that month!! Walked in and weren't acknowledged until we went up to podium and the man there seemed to be bothered and confused we were there. Gave our name and he still seemed confused and kept shuffling menus. A woman came up and said we had to wait, even though the left half of the restaurant was all empty tables and booths!! More people came in and were told to wait even though half the restaurant was empty tables. All the customers waiting were looking at each other as though to say, ""What is their problem?"" Half the restaurant was empty tables!! Finally after a while we left in disgust and headed to the saloon restaurant at the Strater Hotel which was very busy, but found us a great table instantly and we had a wonderful waitress and great meal!! Thank you Applebee's in Durango for being terrible to your customers so we could find this gem of a restaurant at the Strater Hotel!! Other Applebee's we have been to have been great, but this one really sucks!! Don't bother going there!! It will be out of business soon I am sure!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
6,Courtney Y.,"Portland, OR",0,15,5.0,1.0,2017-03-28,"Ordered the nachos. Seemed pretty hard to mess up... or so I thought. They came with chips soaked in grease and a mystery sauce that wasn't quite cheese, wasn't quite ranch. I still have no idea what I ate. My boyfriend had ribs. From what animal I am not entirely sure. Raccoon? Bob cat? I almost forgot my nachos had a French fry mixed in that had clearly been in the fryer for the better part of a decade. It had fossilized into something only an archeologist could identify. I do not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
3,K D.,"Box Elder, SD",0,35,1.0,1.0,2017-05-16,"This is a terrible place to eat. So waiter comes to the table and right off the bat starts complaining about the people not doing their jobs he's doing it all. So we place to order and wait 15 minutes just for water and then only got it because i had to ask the waiter for it. Never see him after he drops off the water! There are several wait staff standing around with lots of durty tables that need cleaned. One guy is doing all the work from what I am seeing. Have been waiting 25 minutes now for soup and salad? The management REALLY NEEDS to do a BETTER job on training or people just need to get a BETTER working ATTITUDE. If you don't want to be there find another job don't make others suffer because you don't want to do the job YOU applied for. Now for the food again soup and salad! You would think you couldn't mess that up! Well think again cold soup and bagged salad, rubber chicken on salad. DO NOT EAT HERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
4,Mandy Q.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,,5.0,2017-07-09,Great service! We had a group of 10 of us and the service was wonderful! The food was actually better than the Applebee's back home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
0,Carrie S.,"Durango, CO",15,8,,3.0,2017-07-30,Other than freezing due to the air conditioner the food was good.  Then parking was another issue!  Some Texan parked so close to us we barely were able to get into our car.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-durango-3,,,,,
2,Tami J.,"Durango, CO",2,12,2.0,1.0,2017-08-05,"This Applebees is hit or miss. Today was a miss. Slow food to table, we waited 30 min! Ticket not right.
