40,Laura C.,"Farmingdale, NY",33,97,,3.0,2012-10-21,"Ah, Applebee's! We have all been there at one point or another, so why bother with a review?  Well, my local one deserves a shout -out because they run a tight ship there.  Service is generally good there and things run smoothly.  A current special worth mentioning is half-price appetizers on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays after 8 pm during Football season.  Three delightful little sliders, with fries is one of those choices which is only $4.50 with this special.  Not too shabby! Big ol' basket of the boneless wings was I believe $ 5.  The only app not in this special was the sampler platter.  But no need to order that because you can go nuts with your pals and get a bunch of apps for that price!

The 1st time I had a bad experience food tasted old and the service wasn't pleasant. This time I decided to give it one more chance. The wings were over fried and black looking (felt like biting into pork rinds), the black n blue burger (was supposed to be well done) came back bloody, most the French fries were the hard over fried bottom of the fryer fries, the chicken tenders for my child were 90% extra hard breading and 10% chicken(so it felt like biting into an ice sculpture). FYI: I don't ever send my food back to the kitchen or complain in person, because they are still handling my food.  As of the service the girl was pretty fast   But when I asked for napkins being that I was there with my child she gives me 2 pieces of napkin as if they were coming out of her paycheck. I believe I gave it a fair chance and it's definitely not a good place to go eat.

Well, the fries were way too salty & overly seasoned & worst of all, ice cold. Great. The burger, which I asked to be cooked at a medium temperature was well done & also very salty. I really hate when food is way too salty. The service was the worst. It took forever to be greeted, to be served the food & to be asked how everything is. I needed a drink for at least 10 minutes before I finally tracked down someone to get it for me. Finally, we had to wait for the check for what seemed like 15 minutes at least.

Dinner was good, typical applebees food but the service was SLOW as anything. We asked three people and it took us over 40 minutes to get the check after we were done eating.

So when this waitress gave us our check, she instantly added gratitude for 2 people as a ten dollar tip.

18,Jo B.,"Melville, NY",4,19,2.0,1.0,2015-09-07,"I went for a birthday dinner for my fiancé and his work friends in hopes we could have a few quick drinks and a bite to eat before swinging by Main Street to continue the festivities. Boy, was I wrong! I've been to this Applebees during the work week and we had prompt service. I guess that only applies to Monday-Friday for the lunch crowd. We checked in for a table for seven people and had to wait a few minutes for the table to cleared to eat. It was 9 pm at this point and the restaurant was pretty quiet so I wasn't really annoyed. As we waited for our party to join us, the server made a few passes to make refills of sugar packets and new ketchup. She seemed like she was impatient to get us started. As everyone showed up and people started deciding on their alcoholic beverage of choice, she seemed to nearly question whether someone of age was in the party. I ordered a margarita which came with an olive in the glass and was tinted green in color. I barely finished one glass but I was expecting something better than I was expecting. This particular waitress apparently had an issue handling a large table and gave us an attitude  before passing us off to another waitress who had way too many tables. I'm not blaming our second waitress as she was covering too much space to be effective. Our table wasn't cleared after dessert was brought out and it was littered with glasses and plates making it ineffective to eat off. At some point, the bartender had to bring our second round out because our waitress couldn't keep up. I ate so little because I was turned off by the service and wasn't sure if I was actually going to have any food. It took us 45 minutes to get the check split up and paid for and we had to give it to another server because she literally vanished. All in all, I didn't get to visit Main Street because a little over 2 hours for some apps, drinks and dessert was a little much.

15,Michelle L.,"Levittown, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-03-04,"I went in to the Applebee's located in airport plaza tonight 3/4/17 after a movie at around ~10:20 pm. I am aware that it is half off apps and often hectic but, upon my arrivial I was greeted at the hostess stand by the manager, Starr, she was INCREDIBLY rude to me. After taking my name (with an attitude) she then proceeded to run over and yell at her waitresses in front of her waiting guests. I understand she may have been stressed however, she is the MANAGER not a hostess and one would think she knows the importance of keeping a calm demeanor in the presence of her guests. I then watched her yell to the other patrons in an unprofessional manner that their table was ready.  She is in the FRONT OF THE HOUSE position on a busy Saturday night when there are other various options all over RT 110 offering similar late night meal options. I will not return to this establishment and hope others will choose elsewhere as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
10,A Felice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,1.0,5.0,2017-04-30,Never had a problem here. The food is always good and never had a problem with the service either. Recommend the BBQ ribs and garlic mash,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
1,John D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,2.0,1.0,2017-07-21,"I walked in with a Party of 5. The host and 2 other employees were standing at the front of the restaurant just hanging out and talking. Didn't acknowledge us until a few minutes after.  Very unprofessional At the very least say ""Hi, I'll be right with you""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
5,Joe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,25,10.0,2.0,2017-07-22,This has nothing to do with the food because it's Applebees and you know what you are going to get. This is about their dinner and a movie offer for 9 dollars at the movie theater across the road. Apparently you have to eat at Applebee's first to buy the tickets. But if you want to reserve your seats like we did you buy your tickets to get the best seats available. I feel like we got ripped off here because we were trying to save our seats. They need a better system like refunding the difference. Not fair!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
3,Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",62,426,1257.0,3.0,2017-08-27,"This was the second time I have ever gone to an Applebee's. The restaurant was somewhat busy and the service was very attentive. Once again, our young guest dove into corn dogs while we shared a chicken salad. What I found interesting was that the restaurant had local school pictures of either sporting events or general events such as Hofstra, Plainview and Amityville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
0,Jim D.,"Queens, NY",356,421,7538.0,4.0,2017-10-27,"Well Hey there Friends! .. How is Everyone doing on this Beautiful Week ending Friday?   Applebee's is one of those chain joints, like Friday's & Buffalo Wild Wings and Outback. All are a bit similar, but offer different experiences. I do not recommend going with any of these establishments during busy times. At times of lighter traffic, however they can be in ideal choice. I was very pleased with my visit this evening at Farmingdale's Applebee's, went with my friend and we sat at the bar. Thursday Night Football and Hockey were the events of the evening. For dinner, we decided to try the Applebees 2 for $20. This turned out to be a very good choicefor us. This meal can be upgraded for $3 extra to include spare ribs, which I did. All together, with the onion ring appetizer mac and cheese and baked potato/ bacon. I had a heck of a meal for 13 bucks.  Service was very fast. I never go to places like this when it's busy. My beer was cold and crisp and a chilled Pilsner. My spare rib and mac and cheese dinner with baked potato arrived in about 10 minutes. First up however were the onion rings, they came to the table in less than 5 minutes. The beer battered rings hot and crisp, quite good. My friends chicken tenders with fries were the average meal nothing to Crow about, but it's what he liked.   Our barmaid was very friendly and engaging. I like the way that this Applebee's has a HomeTown flavor to it, the decorations and interior appointments were really interesting and fun to look at. The wall scenes were personalized and customized with photos of the local school teams and familiar attractions in the local area. It certainly makes it more like you're at home when you're surrounded with the sites that you grew up with. I found this Applebee's a very nice cozy place to relax and enjoy the game and time with friends I was very pleased before our visit here and certainly will return again. Budget-wise, it was a little less than I spend at some other places. I'll be sure to return. JIM D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
4,Danielle R.,"Massapequa Park, NY",29,7,,1.0,2017-11-08,"I wouldn't advise you to go to here but if you do keep track of your receipts..i came here on Halloween with my family (6 total) it was busy so i can understand long wait for food, or drinks, even the dirty silverware we received..but when 1 of the 6 meals failed to even come out of the kitchen and our waiter; Mannie or Manny however the unbelievable horrific waiter spells it, was no where to be seen, everyone else was almost done eating when we FINALLY flagged him done, the so very rude waiter turns and snaps at us saying well why did you wait so long??! Are you kidding me, he then as flamboyantly as possible turns and throws his hands up we then dealt with the manager Jillian who was  Apologetic and all and almost excused his bad behavior because ""they were slammed that night"". We as a group decided NO tip seemed appropriate since he failed to be our waiter, at best he took the order AND THATS it, and even that he didn't do that correctly my food came out wrong. My sister just received her cc statement and it seems as though the horrific waiter decided to change the receipt and tip himself..The police will be called on this thief.
