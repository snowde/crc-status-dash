2,Robin P.,"Saylorsburg, PA",11,22,18.0,2.0,2012-06-24,"I like Applebees, but we left before ordering drinks because it was soooo cold in there.  We asked if there was warmer area, but they said ""sorry, no"".  The one waitress had her arms folded and held close to her body to try and stay warm.  We went to the Red Robins, two minutes away, where it was cool, but not freezing, and had an enjoyable meal.  I will avoid this Applebees during summer months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
0,Mattie C.,"Arlington, VA",95,895,91.0,2.0,2012-06-26,"Was up in the area for a ski trip and was SO excited to go here because boyfriend had never been to one!  What excites me about Applebee's has always been the pork chops and the huge fun drinks.  We came here after skiing absolutely exhausted and really in the mood for pork chops and were HORRIFIED to see there were no pork chops on the menu.  Pork chops is one of Applebee's signature dishes!  Or at least it used to be.  We were both really disappointed and I ended up settling for a boring old bacon cheeseburger (which actually was quite good, but not what I was in the mood for at the time).  Boyfriend's meal: ""generic"" French Onion Soup and Bourbon Street Steak, which was ""overcooked"" and ""the Bourbon was too pronounced.""  I'm actually shocked he remembered so well what he ate as this meal took place more than 2 years ago. I am reviewing this 2 years later because I have noticed in general that something horrible is happening where pork chops seem to be vanishing from the menus of restaurants everywhere.  We need to stop them!  Applebee's used to be reliable in serving up giant pork chops with apple sauce side, and needs to be called out for this major problem.  Please bring the pork chops back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

Two of us ordered from the quick n simple lunch menu (soup & salad). Service was beyond slow, too the point where we walked out. Won't be back.

I am really disappointed because I been to others applebee's before and are just excellent compared to this one, and by the way to the manager who was in charge last night thanks so much to come to my table and asked what was wrong with my food after you saw my face when I got my food.

My steak came out nearly well done, and was very unpleasant and tough. His ribs came out well, thankfully. While sitting there,  I saw someone send their food back, although I'm not sure what they had. Our waitress wasn't friendly, either. My mango frozen lemonade cane out unmixed with the mango syrup all at the bottom. I wouldn't recommend this Applebees to anyone.

5,Julia F.,"Slatington, PA",1,32,2.0,3.0,2014-07-21,"just stopped in here with the rents the other day, initial service was alright if a little lengthy. food seemed to take a while to come out, but maybe its because we didn't order appetizers, just actual entrees. my dads side order was a little messed up, and she brought out the wrong entrée entirely for me initially. I was worried id be waiting a while for my food but it came out a couple minutes later. my mom asked for napkins which our server forgot about until reminded again. food was good, drinks stayed full.. theres a little ziosk on each table that regularly asked if we needed refills though so I don't think that would have been an issue. server seemed to be having a bad week. ziosk quickly took care of the check. overall it was a meh kind of deal. could have been better, could have been worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5?start=20,,,,,
25,Ben H.,"Easton, PA",0,5,8.0,1.0,2015-02-09,"Service was pretty slow for the restaurant being fairly empty at 9 o'clock.  I had taken my friend for his 40th birthday here, and he ordered a drink. The waiter asked for id and then came back again to take and scan it. The (I assume manager of the floor at the time) came  over then and was like ""this is not you"". Do you have another ID or what??"" Not oh happy birthday or anything nice. After showing a credit card with his name on too we finally got that drink he ordered. In my opinion this was pretty dang rude to question someone's identity.  I had ordered a side of bacon that I never saw but was charged for. My friend ordered a burger without pickles. But it had pickles anyhow.  I wasn't impressed at this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,
24,Nicole T.,"Tacoma, WA",41,134,273.0,3.0,2015-04-10,"Everyone knows I love me some Applebee's, and I have my normal location we visit that rocks!!! However we were visiting Pa and decided to stop in to eat before we hit the hotel at 1134p. When we walked in we literally stood there for a good two minutes before I was asked is a hi top okay. I promptly said no but we received no greeting, no hello, no welcome to Applebee's nothing. Thanks JasmineInstead the hostess and the server sat there and talked to clearly someone who seemed to be a friend for that time. Finally we were showed to our table. Our server was prompt and took the time to explain the menu and take our drink orders. I normally order the same thing every time, sirloin with Parmesan shrimp. This time I decided to try just about everything on the new late night menu. We ordered.... Double crunch bone in wings, salsa verde shredded brisket nachos, Kobe style meatballs, siracha shrimp and potstickers and my son ordered the triple bacon burger. Second sign of disappointment.... Our server telling us they all will come out one at a time . WHY!!! If I place an order I assume all my food would come out at the same time at the same temperature.  It's safe to say that the food was really good. All arrived hot and prompt. We are just about everything. So note to self.... Food good, waitress great (Kristina), hostess NOT SO MUCH!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,

We took a while ordering because we had just driven a long way separately and met here for lunch. The waitress was very patient with us and even suggested putting an order in for the kids first, which was a great idea. The food was great and everything was exactly as ordered and hot when it was brought to the table. My 3 year old accidentally purchased a game for $1.99 off of the computer that was at the table and the waitress kindly removed it from our bill. I also placed an order to go. It was accurate and my husband said it was good as well. Friendly service and good food. Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,

We were 3 people and the plates were miserable with a couple fries and the ribs were so thin that I thought I was paying for only the bones in it. It's very overpriced, $19.99 for that kind of ribs? Service was just ok, we waited to the guy clean our table when we ordered some quesadilla and another beer at the end but with no success. First and last time at Applebee's.

21,Miss Foodie M.,"New York, NY",0,199,19.0,2.0,2016-11-18,"I never thought to look on Yelp for Applebees reviews as I thought they were all created equal. Boy was I wrong. I have been to the one In Jersey City NJ and Phillipsburg NJ. Came here because it's really close to my gym. For starters. The booth I was directed to was dirty. There was food on the chair and under the table there were crayons and old receipts. It took a server about 10 minutes to introduce themselves to us. We ordered beers and she asked ""Tall or short?"" Um Starbucks? After a few minutes she came back to ask what size again. The food was decent although why she brought us sour cream and salsa with our spinach and artichoke dip which was confusing. Also, I have ordered the siracha shrimp many times from other Applebees and these were not like them. These barely had the sauce on them and they were cold. Before we finished our meals, our server brought us our check. We felt like we were being kicked out. We ended up ordering more so she took that check back. I can't be too mad at the server it just seemed she was new and lacked training. I knew it was bad when the manager was bussing tables. On the way out it was a bit cramped because for some odd reason a guest was allowed to have a chair at the end of a booth instead of giving them a regular table that would accommodate them. So my friend and I literally stood there waiting for a server to take her order because we couldn't squeeze past. She was completely oblivious that we were standing there. Another server approached from the other direction but not without her trying to get in front of me. Great customer service. That caused us to bump into each other and that server got an attitude. The staff here needs customer service training and server 101 training. Who the hell runs this place? I will not come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,

Most of the time the hostess and wait staff is friendly and nice, however the restaurant is dirty and tables could of used a better cleaning. Normally there is food on the floor under the tables that they don't clean before sitting you. My biggest complaint is when you ask to trade your side of fries for another side. They are perfectly willing to do this, but they never tell you that they is an up charge for changing your side. I don't mind paying, but it would be nice to know before I find out through the bill, when the waitress should of told us while we were putting in our order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,

I like tomatoes and my server was kind enough to bring me a normal slice when I requested it. The French fries were not good looking- too pale but tasted ok. The broccoli on my sons plate was almost raw and unseasoned. I don't understand how the ""cooks"" can send food out without taking pride on how it looks.

15,Carl D.,"Wind Gap, PA",0,103,1.0,2.0,2017-04-29,Stopped tonight because we'd not been here in awhile. We will not be back. So many options in the area that are far better. We arrived very early for a Saturday and were promptly seated. Then waited for about 15 minutes until the waiter realized we we there.  Justin our waiter was a great kid. Very friendly and tried very hard. The nachos appetizer was so-so. The entrees ok but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Limited gluten free choices for my wife and the special menu they brought her was sticky and covered in food (don't people use the menu BEFORE they get their food?).  After our last visit to Applebee's about a year ago we were unimpressed but thought we'd give them another shot - don't know how they can possibly compete with so many much better places in this area of 248.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-5,,,,,

The food, bland, the service, could use improvement, the atmosphere, dull. The parking was good, most likely because nobody was here. The sign on the smudged windowsill, clearly stated ""ask your server about a six pack to go."" I did. I was unsurprisingly let down by the slipshod service.

The service isn't memorable nor is the food. The half off drinks and appetizers late night is the only thing that keeps me coming back. My usual orders are the one dollar long islands (which is usually lots of ice and very very little alcohol) the sriracha shrimp, which is usually drowned in sriracha sauce and the chicken wonton tacos. That happens to be the better side of the options, on the sweeter side of dishes. I've had their tomato soup which was mediocre and their chili which was cold. It's like any other Applebee's.
