2,Kevin M.,"Edmonton, Canada",1,6,1.0,3.0,2012-07-01,"First impressions didn't give me any confidence in this restaurant. Table was still dirty when I was seated, and the floor was filthy. Honey bbq chicken bites were rather good not something I would reorder though. Onion rings were amazing. entree was a bourbon chicken and shrimp, very full of flavor and delicious, will certainly come back again for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton,,,,,
5,Eryn S.,"Edmonton, Canada",10,28,,3.0,2012-12-09,"Applebee's is usually pretty tasty! I went with 3 friends this past Saturday. The wait time was 15 minutes, which was fine. We were seated by the bar, our first waitress didn't have any idea about the drink or food menu, which was kind of a let down- me not being able to eat gluten I just wanted to know if the French fries and chicken were deep fried in the same oil. But she put up a ""huff"" having to go to the kitchen to ask..The bartender came up to us and said he would be serving us after waiting for 20 minutes at the table. After that little mishap  dinner went uphill. We all enjoyed our food, our drinks and good company in a good atmosphere!  Definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton,,,,,
