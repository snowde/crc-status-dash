Unfortunately the best part of this meal was the chips and salsa.  The food was just gross. I had the peppercorn steak and my bf had some pasta. Unfortunately the service wasn't great either. The waitress wasn't rude but just completely uninterested.  I would recommend the Applebee's in Hazard center.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=100,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.212,2.12
115,J N.,"Alpine, CA",0,9,,3.0,2012-02-09,"I must admit, I have never really been a fan of Applebees or any other similar restaurant.  However, my daughter enjoys it, so on 2/6/12 we were in the area and went there for dinner.  We were greeted warmly at the door and seated immediately.  Our server, Kylie, was a little slow in arriving, but she was very nice.  I ordered a glass of wine.  My one complaint here is that they don't have the wine prices on the menu.  My daughter ordered the Chicken Broccoli Bowl and I ordered a salad and the Weight Watchers Cabernet Mushroom Steak.  I would have ordered the steak from the description alone, not just because it was less than 550 calories.  The salad was nothing special.  My daughter really enjoyed her pasta.  It was a huge portion.  The steak was wonderful.  I could not believe how good it was.  It was tender, cooked to perfection, and the sauce was awesome.  Both my daughter and I got doggie bags.  I was so impressed with the steak I was seriously looking for somebody to compliment when we left.   Kylie was very attentive.  She kept apologizing for delays, but I thought her service was fine and tipped her accordingly.    So why am I only giving them three stars?  I woke up on 2/7/12 with vomiting and diarrhea.  I am still sick 3 days later.  I know it may not be related, but I can't help wondering about food poisoning, especially after reading the other posts here.   Because of the steak, I will probably eat here again (though not as a first choice), but I don't think I'll order a salad.  (BTW, I have not been able to eat the leftovers and don't think I will.  However, I gave some to my cats.  Only one of them ate some, which is unusual, but she did eat it, so I'm sure it wasn't the steak if there was a food borne illness issue.)

114,Ross L.,"Lakeside, CA",6,50,,2.0,2012-02-12,"We went to Applebee's the other night for dinner.  My sister just started Weight Watchers and was interested in checking out their WW menu items.  We got seated in a reasonable amount of time (four of us) and then the server who brings us our drinks promptly tells us that she is going on break.  Oh great, you know what that means...our table has just landed in the restaurant equivalent of ""no man's land"".  And, as expected, from there the service went downhill.  The food was okay, but it was definitely a challenge getting a server to come back to our table for any reason.  They didn't waste any time, however bringing the check when they brought our main courses out.  We decided to order some desert and it literally took ten minutes to track down a server to order from and then another fifteen minutes to get ONE desert that we all shared.  We then waited another several minutes after finishing the desert for the updated bill to arrive.  Good thing we were not in a hurry...All in all, nothing to write home about, but something to write Yelp about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=160,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.472,2.2

165,Jeremy T.,"Santee, CA",53,138,30.0,3.0,2012-07-15,"My wife and I took the kids there yesterday on route to go see Madagscar 3. Which was pretty funny. Anyways, on topic! We really enjoy this location. With it being newly remodeled, it has really made it known that they are doing what they need to do to get better. The girls and their friend ordered off the kids menu, (2) orders of Chicken Tenders and a Chicken Breast sandwich. All three were very pleased with what they got. I must say, the Chicken breast sandwich looked pretty damn good. My wife ordered the Chicken Tender Platter which comes with 7 Tenders, Coleslaw, and french fries. The Chicken was cooked perfeclty, nice and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. I know, I know, its just Chicken Tenders, But... I have had some rank ass Chinken Tenders before. These were good.  I ordered the Applebees Reuben. Honestly, not their best sandwich but it was do-able. The problem was not the contents of the sandwich, even though the meat seemed like it was straight out of a package of pastrami you can buy at the store, it was the soggy bottom. The bottom of the sandwich was so saturated with the contents from inside the sandwich it really seemed that it sat and waited under the heat lamp for the rest of the order to get done. Kind of disappointing.  Other than that, the service was good, the happy hour was descent, I mean, my wife had a Margarita that she said tasted like straight bottle mix, and I had a beer. I dont drink fizzy yellow beer often, but when I do. I prefer Dos Equis. Ha Ha Ha Ha, just being dumb. Really though, with the bar being remodeled also, I was really hoping to see more a of a selection tap wise. Its really pretty weak actually. Bud Light, Dos Equis, Coors Light, Blue Moon and Sam Adams Boston Lager. It would just be cool for them to consider throwing on a few more Micro brews. Carry some local guys on your taps.

82,Linda J.,"San Diego, CA",738,911,4236.0,2.0,2012-11-24,"We started with drinks, a Mountain Dew and a water with lemon please? We asked from our waitress Savonne B. and the drinks were brought out promptly.  I want to start with telling you how awesome this waitress really was.  If I had to hire someone I would really hire her!  So, the first drink came with something that was a small black ball that was not really floating at the bottom of the soda glass.  I took a picture and posted it immediately.  When we told Savonne she apologized profusely promising to bring us another soda which arrived in a minimal amount of time.  The second Mountain Dew was presented and right when a sip was about to be taken we noticed a bug at the top of the glass.  Really? Again?  I could not believe this!  Savonne apologized again and then said she would have the manager come over and he did.  Jamie T. came over and announced who he was.  I was pretty shocked at him saying that we requested him to come over which we did not.  We told him the problem and he said he would check on that immediately and appreciated our feedback.  Sometimes things happen in restaurants right?  Meanwhile, our meals were brought out.  I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettuccine~Seared plump shrimp, ripe tomatoes, onions, sautéed fresh spinach and basil served over fettuccine noodles lightly tossed in a roasted garlic cream sauce and topped with artichokes, lemon zest and Parmesan.  My man ordered the Sizzling steak fajitas~Served with lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice, sautéed onions & red peppers, fire roasted poblanos and white cheddar. Steak and Chicken.  My dish looked wonderful.  My man's plate did not have the Chicken that was ordered and the rice that was served was burning on the hot plate.  So again, we had to find Savonne to let her know yet something else has gone wrong.  Jaime brought out the chicken about 5 minutes later.  As I was eating I also noticed that my silverware was really dirty but at this point I am so drained from complaining and it was almost time for our movie that I needed to order an Appletini.  I have never had one before and NOW seemed like a great time for one.  The drink was really fruity and had a nice taste to it and I can now say that I have had one.  I would never order it again but that is no fault to Applebee's.  The cool part about the drink was the carved out pieces of apple on a small sword~ I liked that.  The manager Jaime came back to advise us that they found the source of the bugs at the tap of the Mountain Dew spout and that it has now been resolved which was pretty cool.   Yes, we ate the food and it was actually really good considering the shortcomings that came previously.  Savonne came over to offer us a ""Sunday dessert shooter"" for the inconvience to which we decided to pass on.   If you read my reviews I am not very nice and will tell it like it is.  Long story made midsize, lol is that the food was great once they got it right.  The service was wonderful from both the waitress and the manager however I have never sat at home saying ""ooh I want to go and eat at blah blah because their service is great and the food is good but everything else is dirty except the bathrooms!""  I think that they may need to have Bar Rescue come in to explain how to not stack glasses so that they are not dirty at the rim of the glasses and how to keep the bugs out. PS: The bathrooms were really clean and they do have a diaper changing station in the ladies.  I also liked the fact that they sponser local sports teams and have their pictures all over the walls.  They have more than just sports stuff showing on the Tv's.  I had to give this a 2 star because of the filth and the wrong orders coming out.  Otherwise this could have been a 4 or 5!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.2800000000000002,2.28
150,Lauren P.,"La Presa, San Diego, CA",7,34,15.0,1.0,2013-01-12,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I would give this place zero stars if I could. This is the worst service I have ever had. We've only been here three times and each time was worse than the last. The last time was the last straw.  We came to watch a football game, and a specific game at that. There was another playoff game going on right before and ended up going into overtime, overlapping with the game we came to see. We asked our server if they could change the channel of the tv right in from of our table to a different game, and first she told us the 49ers weren't playing that day. Knowing she wasn't the brightest we assured her they were, but she said they could not change the channel until the broncos game was over because everyone in the bar came to see that game. Not really understanding why they couldn't change one tv out of the 10 TVs in the whole place, we patiently waited for the game to end.  Having to get updates from ESPN on our phones, we asked one of the managers if he could change the channel to the game we came here to see, and were currently missing. He said the same thing, that everyone else there was watching it and they would change the channel when the game was over.  So we waited more, missing the more of the niners game. When the broncos game went to double overtime we began getting very upset because we shouldn't have to miss our game, I mean they have ten TVs for god sakes. We asked a second manager why we couldn't just change the channel on the tv in front of us since we appeared to be the only ones looking at it. He said the tv is connected to the main tv in the bar and they have to be on the same channel and they won't change the main tv until that game was over. Ok I can understand that. But instead of the manager coming up with a solution to keep his customers happy, we had to ask if we could be seated near a less main tv to change the channel of the tv. He said he would go look for a new table to move us to.  He was gone for about 10 min, serving food to several tables and avoiding us. The ravens ended up scoring, finally ending the game. We were happy to be able to finally watch the game we solely came here to watch. As we were waiting for the manager to return, or someone to change the channel whichever came first, the bartender changed the channel of the main tv at the bar.  Oddly enough the channel on our tv never changed. Which according to the manager they were connected so if you change one you change both. My boyfriend became enraged, understandably. When the manager finally returned we explained why we were so mad and asked why the manager lied to us. He had no answer. When further explaining that we wasted our time, were lied to and received horrible service he had nothing to say. No solution, no apology, nothing to try and continue our service here. He just blankly stared at us and walked away.  So we won't continue our service here. No one should.  In only three times they have lost our business. The management team here is a joke and give no effort at customer service whatsoever. Don't dine here, unless you want to be treated like dirt!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=140,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.148,2.2

Last year on the same day for lunch I visited this restaurant as well and my order was served wrong. The manager then comped our food or at least half of it (I no longer have receipt), and really made up for it. I have no idea why more was not done for me on my birthday at this location.

I ordered that, and a bar bite size wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon.  The wedge arrived first and it was a very good size for a $5 bar bite ( ). This was a good deal and tasted quite good. The ice berg was fresh and crisp and the bacon crunchy and flavorful. Once I got through the top layer, it did need a little more blue cheese dressing, but it was not a big deal since you can get more on the side ( ). I would order this again, but I would suggest they offer fresh cracked black pepper with the salad.  The Four Cheese Grille was good, but it arrived as if it was sitting at the pass a little to long because the bread was lukewarm and the cheese had already started to congeal ( ). It tasted very good, especially all the four cheeses together, but I rather of eaten it piping hot with cheese actively slowly dripping out, not stationary ( ). Nevertheless, the grilled cheese was great for dipping in the thick and tasty tomato basil soup ( ). The cup of soup came with some good croutons and the soup was thicker than most and quite good ( ).  Sarah, my server was great. She was very friendly and appropriately attentive.

That first time we went there it was truly amazing, delicious and like no Applebee's we had ever had. We went back two more time and both times the food was below par. Don't know how it fell so far from what we had had that first time. The macaroni was gross and watery and the sandwich my boyfriend got was alright but my food was just gross. The service was great there and the waitresses are very sweet. Not to be a pain or try to just get something free, I let our server know how soft and watery my food was and that was the reason I didn't really eat much. I just told her to let her know so maybe they could tell the chef whatever he was doing it was not good. The manager was nice and offered a free desert but I had no appetite for anything else and neither did my boyfriend. So he took half off the pasta.

Then tried the touch screen at the table to call the waitress.  Finally just flagged someone down.  This is not the first issues we have had with customer service at this location.  My husband has even talked with the manager about it.

88,Jeneva C.,"San Diego, CA",10,134,85.0,1.0,2015-05-21,Went here for a late night last minute bite to eat with my husband. He wasnt hungry so only I ate. Cant mess up one dish right? Wrong! I ordered the most simple thing on the menu which is all I get any and everywhere. Chicken tenders! So we were there at around 830 so it wasn't too busy.  Seated fast and I ordered.  Got the plate of food in literally 5-7minutes. I was in shock. I even said Wow that was fast and the kid said yup thats applebees. I said yea but is it fresh. Anyways so the fries were hot and fresh so I figured wow maybe they are just fast. NO! My chicken yes was hot very hot but CHEWY!! like jerky. I told my waitress but figured ehhh ill just eat it bc I was hungry and it was late.  After trying each other piece I realized it was all 3 pieces. I told her I wanted to change it and she was nice but gave me rebuttles for everything I said. Even had the nerve to say well thats how tenders are cut so they're supposed to be chewy!!! Im sorry miss but I have had chicken strips at every place even down to red lobster and cheesecake factory. Not to mention my husband was a butcher for 10 yrs so yes I know how tenders are cut dear!!! I was beyond shocked that she was trying to even justify them... i said forget it ill eat them!! She sent the manager over for IDK what but he was more apologetic but again at that point I had eaten half the chewy chicken. I came to realize that maybe they tossed them back in the fryer which is why they were hot but probably why they were so overcooked and served so fast! I was craving what I went in for which was desert so I still ordered it. Thats the only reason this place is even getting any stars. I figured I wouldve been comped the nasty chicken or even a free soda sheesh but nope not a second look. Therefore the bad review. You're welcome Applebees!! No wonder your yelp score is so low... learn from it bc you'll lose alot of customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=80,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.34,2.32

My wife and I went in early on a Friday night and the place was less than half full. We were seated quickly and then we were completely ignored. At least half a dozen servers passed close by our table and a couple of different servers helped out the table next to us. Not a single one of them even acknowledged our presence. We even pressed the ""call server"" button on the stupid IPAD thingy on the table and set it so that anyone who looked in our general direction would have seen the flashing light on it. After more than 10 minutes had passed we decided to leave. As we were walking out the door the hostess asked us if we enjoyed hour dinner. We told her that we never got it and we weren't going to sit around any longer and be ignored. We walked out and went next door to ""On The Border"" were we had a great meal and fast service.

After we were all finished we waited 20 minutes, our plates were never taken away and his hands were empty every time he passed our table. A few other people kept walking by, nobody checked on us. A blonde hostess and bussed were talking at a table across from us for a few minutes about weekend plans.

Your standards need to be high because I'm eating food that you are serving.  Before I even walk in, you need to convince me that your restaurant is worth the effort. It's all perception. As I read these 5 star reviews, I can't help but think the managers friends have been asked to review this restaurant. Maybe the locals at the bar have been asked to post a positive review, but I just didn't see it. I don't even want you to give me a refund of my money or a discount. Because of that point, it's too late. Just get it right the first time so you don't have to make excuses about how you screwed it up! The last time we were at this Applebee's was almost a year ago.  The reason why we had not returned was because of the service and substandard food.  I know that sometimes people have bad days, but you don't let it affect your work. We decided to give them a second try, maybe after year things have changed. Well, nothing has. We where made to wait when there where tables avalible. We were sat at tables we could have been seated in 15 minutes ago. They seem to have a lack of staff/servers, not my problem. Server appologised for entering other tables data first. I asked twice for the same drink order. Appetizers came out with no plates presented from manager There was minimal table maintenance, beverage refills, table cleanup etc. Server looked overwhelmed. No sence on ergency from the staff. No pacing of the meal. The gap between serving kids and serving the adults was 15 min.  Warmer than room temp ranch dressing, notified server, and no attenpt to fix it. Other tables near us had issues as well so this was not an isolated incident. Mac n cheese pasta was ok. not the sauce. This looks like a management issue. After being in food service and managing food service, this is mostly about training and standards. The Applebee's in Rancho San Diego is much better, much more efficient and just better at what they do.

22,Jared O.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-07-31,This review is mainly on the staff that Applebee's hires to answer the phones and take online orders. I always try and take advantage of online ordering after a busy day of work. But my last 2 experiences with this location is just enough. Every time I call multiple women who answer the phone never know the menu put me on hold sometimes I've had it to where I've got hung up on. The last 2 times I've ordered food and it was brought out to me it was wrong and not even close to what I ordered. It's just a waste of time for me and restaurant when people answering the phones have no clue on what they are doing. Bottom line is food has always tasted good here but service wise has been garbage and honestly I don't even feel like coming here anymore because of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=20,2.88,2.79,2.79,,2.8259999999999996

25,Cream D.,"La Mesa, CA",38,6,2.0,1.0,2017-10-11,NEVER HAD WORST SERVICE! Last Thursday my party and I waited over 20 min for a table (which was fine it was busy) we were finally sat at our table at 730pm as soon we sat down the waitress took our drink AND FOOD order (since I was with my 3 year old daughter and 6month old niece we made sure to look at the menu while we waited to be seated since anyone with kids knows their patience is short) First of all I drove from mission valley area to applebees for the $1 drinks they are promoting as soon we order them we were told they only have 1 flavor (not what is advertised) but whatever we order the 1 flavor. about 805 our apps came the cheese sticks where cold and cheese was hard like biting into an eraser you could tell they have been sitting. After waiting trying to give them benefit of doubt I finally asked to see a manger around 825. His name is NESS I believe. He came to the table and 1/2 a** apologized by saying the kitchen is backed up and WE COULD PAY FOR THE FOOD N DRINKS THAT HAD BEEN SERVED AND LEAVE...... No mention of comp. I have NO PROBLEM paying for my food my order was gonna be well over $40. So overall I completely wasted a night that was supposed to be full of good food and laughs with my dinner party instead I left very angry and still had to go buy food else where. I have also submitted my concerns to cooperate since dealing with the location management is just as bad as the service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=20,2.92,2.87,2.87,,2.8899999999999997

7,Jeffrey C.,"La Mesa, CA",1,11,,3.0,2017-11-23,"We were immediately greeted and seated. Service was friendly and timely. As far as the food, it's on the level of a TV dinner. To it's credit, a better TV dinner like a Stouffers.  We had the 2 for 25 deal. The appetizer was the chicken strips. Portion: Decent. Taste: 5 1/2. Deep fried to a crisp. It came with ranch dressing that lacked flavor. It's obviously the cheap version. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs. It seemed overdone from the day before. Where do they get such small ribs? I know I can't find these in any supermarket this small. Must come from a small ranch. Portion: Small(est) Taste: 5 Sides: Fries and broccoli. Fries were average. The broccoli had good flavor. My guest had the chicken and 3-cheese Mac. The chicken came in strips that were deep fried. I know they stole them from the appetizer counter. As for the Mac, I swear they left off one or two of the three cheeses. Dryer side. Lacked any type of creaminess and flavor. No sides came with this dish. Taste: 4 Add ons: 2 bowls of French onion soup. First off, why are bowls the size of cups these days? Five bucks. Portion: Small. Taste: 4.5 Bill with tip: $41.00 Value: Poor. You will not leave here and say, ""Now that was a great meal!"". Unless you're a manager, employee, you got a comp so you lied, an investor, the landlord, or think that McDonalds is a family owned sit down restaurant.  Hey Applebees! Try eating your own food. Then hire a top rated chef to redo your recipes.

But before I left I figured out a side of mushroom toppers that I ordered wasn't in the bag so I let one of the workers know, I was asked by at least 4 different employees what I needed before one of the girls realized none of those 4 workers were going to check on the mushrooms. Already bad service, then I come to find I need to wait a little while.. Ok i asked how long they said 5min.. I waited at least 15min just for a side of sautéed mushrooms..
