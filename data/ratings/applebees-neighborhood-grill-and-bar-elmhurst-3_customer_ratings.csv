81,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",35,557,,3.0,2012-03-03,"Considering the odds, our experience wasn't half bad. I mean, it's what you would expect - strollers, teenagers, muffin tops, birthday singing, sticky menus, hard water stained silverware, and the list goes on.  But the worst part was probably the wait - both to get a seat, and for our food. We ordered from the $20 for 2 entrees and an appetizer, which we agreed was a great deal.  We had the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, and then the oriental chicken salad and chicken pasta. The dip was pretty good, a good amount of spinach, creamy, hot, with melted parmesan on top. Lots of homemade, thin crispy tortilla chips, and salsa. The dip came out right away, about 5-10 minutes after we ordered. But the food, took at least 30-45 minutes, which is not really acceptable considering how simple it was.  However, the salad and pasta were pretty great too.  The salad was not overdressed, and it wasn't too salty or fatty either, a pleasant surprise. The pasta was creamy and had great flavor. Our server was nice and attentive.  Overall, this was a great introduction to this chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=80,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

For dinner the place definitely cannot compete with any respectable restaurant. The upside of Applebee's though is the pricing. Most of the dishes are very cheap. They have combo deals and many other deals tucked away in the menu. If you work near an Applebee's it is a great place to go for break or after work for drinks.

I went there in June with my family for a little celebration. Normally, I would go for a bacon cheeseburger but that night I decided to change it up a little and ordered a ""well done"" steak. Upon arrival it looked good but once cut opened it was red and bleeding in the middle. -_-  I DIDN'T eat it.  Now,  I am not one to really complain or send back food & have my night ruined over an uncooked steak. So, I just pushed the steak to the side and ate the potatoes. Still, wishing that I would've stuck with getting my ""norm"",  I decided to ask my waitress (Who's the only reason why this place would even be given stars) for a bacon cheeseburger to go. Before walking out my TO-GO bag was given to me  and silly me didn't even bother in checking it until the next morning.  In my defense, I always order a bacon cheeseburger at other locations and it never changes.....BOY was I WRONG! When I opened my bag the next day to reheat the burger I was shocked to find UNCOOKED French Fries and GROUND BEEF (literally) slapped in between the bun. Never have I ever experienced this at any other AppleBee's location. I am always given a patty & cooked fries! Not straight up ground beef that looked like they just pulled out of  its package and grilled for two minutes on both sides!   -What was in that bag was disgusting and a violation. Frozen fries?
