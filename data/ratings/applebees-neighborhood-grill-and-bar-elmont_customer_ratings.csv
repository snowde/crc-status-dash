39,Brittany A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",623,371,398.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"This is a  new Applebee's and like many Applebees' the food has a consistent quality. There was nothing special about this particular spot's food BUT the service was lovely which can really make or break an Applebee's. I came in on a Tuesday night with my mom and baby sis (I'm still calling her baby and the brat is 7). It was freezing outside and the young lady at the door was super chipper and friendly and welcomed us in. There was no wait at all. And we sat in a cute little booth not too far from the door.  It was so warm inside. Perfect for a freezing winter night. It felt like a nice summer's evening inside there. Our waiter was busy by the bar but he glanced over at us and mouthed for us to give him just a moment and he'd be right over. He came right over after a few more seconds. A man of his word. I love that! He was polite and attentive and friendly. Stayed to chat with us for a while and was patient as my mom took forever to order. I had the fish and chips (for the first time). I will say the fish was a tad oily so we'll knock off a star...but still yummy nonetheless. The manager kept strolling around making sure everyone was having a good night. We asked him for some wing sauce and a refill and he sent our waiter right to us with it in like 45 seconds. I don't even know how he did that. We ordered, did the mad libs on the kids menu, and the food was right out! Not a long wait at all. We also got to watch a million different games that were on, considering they have all these televisions hanging up. It was a nice evening and of course everything was on the cheap. I loveeee this Applebee's and definitely will be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmont?start=40,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
66,S H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,2012-08-05,"Party of four waited 30 minutes until the server arrived to the table to take our orders. The food took approx 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered the ultimate trio ( classic wings, boneless barbecue and wonton chicken tacos). I picked up one of the tree tacos preparing to place it in my mouth when I noticed a thick strand of brunette hair between the chicken. In disbelieve, I showed everyone at the table who all agreed that it was a piece of HAIR. The server came to the table to apologize despite my immediate request to speak with the manager who came shortly after. The manager apologize but somehow his apology did not appear to be genuine. The manager stated that trio would be on him. The food was replaced and needless to say, the wings were slighlty below warm and the boneless wings were overcooked and very hard. Once we were ready to leave, a request was made for a to go box. The server arrived with box and plastic bag which he tossed while apologizing for our experience. Again apology was not genuine.

62,Elly F.,"Nassau County, NY",49,89,9.0,1.0,2012-10-21,"So I recently returned to this Applebee's and left without even eating.  While we were seated fairly quickly, our waiter/waitress never arrived at the table. After realizing no one was stopping at our table, and looking around wondering who was going to be waiting on us, I set my phone timer to five minutes because that was the most I was willing to continue to wait. At the two minute mark I hear a waiter telling the waitress, who was attentively attending the table next to us, ""you have this table, right?"", and pointing to us. She nods her head, and then he decides to tell us, ""she will be right with you.' At this point I am wondering why she never stopped by the table to acknowledge us when she passed by us multiple times. Another waiter had to remind you that you have us as a table? Really? And then you act annoyed because you knew this all along??  Well luckily for us there is another Applebee's not to far away, so we got up and left.

The staff is super friendly & customer service is spot on great! A manager always stops by to chit-chat & I think every company should be as nicely trained as this one. There was 1 sweet waitress named Priscilla that my mom & I had fun talking to. She was really nice & pretty & we told her. Wish we had a score card to give her boss! She deserved a raise! Since its a bar food kind of place my expectations were low but I can always find a decent dish thats not too fattening & they have the Weight Watchers point system dishes that are quite tasty!

65,V R.,"Flushing, NY",0,11,,2.0,2013-09-07,Went to this Apple Bees on Friday night.  Had a decent crowd of people in the restaurant.  The waitress we had was not very friendly and got annoyed when I asked her questions.  She seemed to have no customer or serving skills.  She bought 2 appetizer plates and drops it one of top of each other without placing it on the sides of the table where we were seated.  A guy then brings us a glass of soda holding it by the rim (how unsanitary).  The waitress never came by to ask us if we needed anything else or if we enjoyed our meal.  The food was okay but my margarita was great.  Thank goodness after my experience I needed that drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmont?start=60,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

I was offered a drink from their drink menu, of course, but declined and I decided to make a short order. For my child, she had 1/2 cheesy bread pizza with mozzarella sticks and the kids size lemonade. I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered a brownie sundae with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a cheese quesadilla without bacon, to go, even though I was informed that the quesadilla that states that it contains bacon, did not have bacon included in the order, due to complaints. What was received was hard, crusty garlic bread covered in some kind of cheese and tomato paste and luke warm mozzarella sticks, and a half melted and messy brownie sundae. I also received the cheese quesadilla without the bacon BUT IT WAS PLATED. After I specified to the waitress that I did not want the plate and I wanted it to go, I recieved it, luke warm, approximately 20 minutes later. After I got too tired to deal, I asked for a check, gave the minimum 15% and left (oh and i never once recieved a napkin, not one).  The service here isn't entirely atrocious (I left my keys in the booth and the waiter came and brought them to me) but it isn't anything to write home about. I've come here several times and I always receive the same level of service on a consistent basis. I understand this is a fast food place with places to sit but they have to give their waitstaff more training. Will I be returning, not likely.

48,Edmund C.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,3,,2.0,2016-05-01,"I put in effort to recover my long lost yelp account to review this horrible experience.  To start off, our appetizers arrived before we were even given our plates and utensils. They gave us temporary plastic utensils because apparently their dish washing machine was being fixed. Shouldn't we be aware of this situation before we get our food and realize we don't have anything to eat with?  Secondly, when the waiter asked how I would like my steak cooked, I asked her what my choices were. I specifically choose medium, the rawest option they offered. 20 minutes later, I received a dish of uncooked  onions and a well-done steak.  The dish was sent back and the manager appeared to handle the situation. I received a new dish 10 minutes later, better than the previous, but still just mediocre. On top of this, a few of the staff who looked like waitresses standing by the stack of menus, gave our table dirty stares while whispering to each other, which I found highly insulting and unnecessary.  Because of that, I also felt unsafe eating at this restaurant. Who knows what these unfriendly people do to our food?  The only reason why this was a 2-star instead of one was because the manager, I believe his name was Mr. Singh, as well as the waiter and waitress who served us, tried their best to handle the situation and make up for their rude and lacking co-workers.  PS: The restaurant was practically empty, there should be no excuse for this incomplete service.
