1,Bruce N.,"Akron, PA",5,54,5.0,3.0,2012-01-25,"they just changed their menu - which means they raised the prices.  I used to like applebees because of quick service, decent food, and reasonable prices.  but now the new menu moved many items from the 10 buck range, changed a few names, then moved them into the 14-15 buck range.   Plus they took away the steak salad, one of my wife's faves.  Never liked the booths - you sink into those cushions like the titanic, so when you order the 20 oz beer in the tall glass, the top of the glass is practically eye level - and i'm a big guy. I do like the comic pages placed above the urinal though - something to do while you're hanging out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Don N.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,18,,1.0,2012-07-10,"This Applebees has given me bad food for the last time, and It has ruined the restaurant chain permanently for me.  I order this blackened chicken and shrimp and it came out completely burnt and inedible, and the waitress didn't seem to care.  Speaking of service, where is it?  Servers are rarely present even when the place doesn't seem very busy; I've waited 15mins for a check to be returned.  Point is, every time I go here, I wish I didn't; anywhere else in Ephrata is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
19,Gladys G.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",2,13,1.0,4.0,2013-03-14,The service was really great. Our waiter was consistent with us and made great suggestions. Even the manager came by to ask if everything was fine. One star missing because my boyfriend's pasta was a little over cooked and because their half price appetizers didn't start until 9 pm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
21,Grace S.,"Ephrata, PA",7,2,,5.0,2013-06-19,"Excellent!  Our waitress, Denette, was the best waitress I have ever had.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and on top of everything.  She greeted us and asked if anyone had a special occasion today or celebration. She asked every table that as well.   My 5 year old asked her for bacon while eating his meal.  I said to him they can't just bring you bacon.  Not only did she bring it right away, no charge.  Our burgers were cooked just right and delicious. Awesome time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
13,Leslie H.,"Ephrata Township, PA",1,21,65.0,1.0,2014-03-19,"We dod the 2 for $20 curbside service. We ordered the Citrus lime sirloin and Three Cheese Chicken penne pasta w spinach artichoke dip. This meal was really a disaster right from the beginning, the chips had so much salt on them we basically couldn't eat them the dip was fine. The steak was meant to be medium and was cooked like a hockey puck and had so much salty sauce on it it was mostly inedible. The pasta is nothing to write home about basically white penne pasta with a fettuccine sauce and three small pieces of chicken and a couple little pieces of tomato with a breadstick. We definitely won't eat here again it was just really really disappointing even for under 20 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
0,George B.,"Ephrata Township, PA",7,26,,2.0,2014-05-03,"Been here several times, as we live within 3 miles. Let's face it folks, this is chain restaurant food served and cooked by hard working, under-paid folks to minimum standards. Our previous visits were fine. But tonight.....our waitress was great, chatty, but great. She was very busy. I normally do not order steak in a restaurant, but I had previously had a fine steak here. Tonight I had a limey-steak thing. My back molars had a workout. My wife a similar dish, and she said it was great. Our 14 year old had a cheeseburger quesadilla thingee that he said was ""weird"", but.......he's 14. Applebee's be Applebee's, so don't expect much. The employees deserve better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Derich B.,"Ephrata, PA",0,1,,5.0,2014-05-22,"I've been to this Applebee's dozens of times and I haven't had any complaints as of yet. All the servers are very friendly, the orders are always brought in a timely fashion. I would recommend going to this Applebee's if you enjoy friendly servers who like to get to know their customers and make sure you leave satisfied. Peg and Jess are 2 of the best servers there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
17,Jeff B.,"South Boston, Boston, MA",1,7,,1.0,2014-08-16,"Food took and hour to get to us. When it did arrive, the presentation was horrible. Steak was cold and appeared grey in color. Chicken portabello had 3 shriveled up mushrooms and smothered in a cheap gravy with way too many onions. Woman that served it threw the plates on the table and ran away--I now know why. Manager was perplexed, as I had eaten the food by the time someone came to ask us if the food was okay. I was not going to wait another hour for more of the same crap. Been here several times before--Chillis from now on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
15,Jessica M.,"Lancaster, PA",2,21,1.0,2.0,2014-11-06,"The food was standard however the service was very bad. Our waitress was not attentive and decided to hang out with her friends the whole evening in the booth across from us.  The drinks, food, and check took too long to come to our table. Expectations were not met  I hope it was just an off day for the restaurant and our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
16,Suzanne R.,"Prospect Park, NJ",5,23,6.0,4.0,2014-11-11,So nice to be there witnessing their dedication to our vets today!  And food was really good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
14,Mike B.,"Lancaster, PA",0,14,,2.0,2015-01-14,The food wasn't good at all and it was cold. Took a longtime to get my food. The only good thing is that the waitress was friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
7,Teresa S.,"Leola, PA",6,26,1.0,2.0,2015-05-04,Ok. So I have been going to Applebee's for years. I usually with go with family. Lately it seems Applebee's it gearing more towards a younger atmosphere. I see it's usually busy late at night. Once in awhile I will go for dinner. I love the 2 for $20. Decent portions. French onion soup isn't good tho.  It really is the only place to get a steak in ephrata. Mind you you have to make sure the steak is done the way you want it when they bring it out. I like mine well done and I've received a steak that was bloody. Not good.  DO NOT DO CARSIDE CARSIDE has never been a good experience for me. The food is plopped on each other. Pasta is runny. Overall not good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
12,Cindy R.,"Holbrook, NY",25,26,,4.0,2015-07-25,I don't really go to Applebee's but it was right next to our hotel so we went. Food was delish and service was awesome!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
11,Ryan W.,"Niagara Falls, NY",1,9,4.0,3.0,2015-10-25,"Service was slow, food took very long. Later after we got our drinks, we got our appetizers, which were cold. Wouldn't recommend. I would say go to a different Applebee's, or other restaurant completely. Otherwise, the food was good, and the bill was o.k.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
10,Josh R.,"Ephrata Township, PA",34,4,,2.0,2016-02-20,"It's glorified fast food, certainly nothing special. The water at this particular ephrata location is toxic. The best thing is the half priced appetizers. It's a nice place to go with friends after 10pm and take advantage of the deal. As I said, it's just a so-so restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
9,Marty M.,"Alexandria, VA",33,69,9.0,1.0,2016-07-11,"Service was great, manager was friendly and helpful when a dish didn't come out as ordered. Inexpensive and clean. Totally would eat here again if I didn't get horrible food poisoning. Avoid the chicken tenders :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
8,Andrew S.,"Lititz, PA",17,7,,2.0,2016-11-06,Other Applebee's have been good to me but this one let me down. I ordered the brunch burger and had high hopes. The bread was completely dried out and crumbling as I ate it. The hash brown was also dried out. To top it off the entire burger was cold. They also forgot my wife's lettuce and tomato. For the price range I expected much better quality.  Otherwise our server was very friendly and helpful. The place seemed clean and they seated us promptly. Hopefully they just had an off day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
6,Gail S.,"Lancaster, PA",0,7,,1.0,2017-03-05,I wouldn't even give it a 1. We went there for my husbands birthday and it was horrible. The drinks stunk and the food was salty.  I had to come home and make something to eat. All the food we bought went to our dogs and they didn't even eat it. Almost 70 dollars of garbage! So so disappointed. Will never go there or recommend it to anyone either! Now I feel like I owe him a better meal!!!! Yuck!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
5,Brooke W.,"Ephrata, PA",0,7,,5.0,2017-05-20,"I love this restaurant so much, we used to come there so often that the waiters would recognize us. Their staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and service is good. I have no idea why it is rated less than 3 stars, but I would definitely recommend this restaurant! My favorite appetizer is the wonton tacos, favorite meal is the fiesta lime chicken (it is seriously irresistible), and favorite dessert is the one chocolate cake with the hot fudge in the middle, I do not recall what it was called. What more can I say about this place? Well, I definitely recommend you check this place out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
4,Crystal R.,"Ephrata, PA",0,7,3.0,2.0,2017-11-07,"Last 4 visits were not pleasant. Specifically asked for a simple side of queso for our salsa and chips and was charged $7.99. On bill it was listed as artichoke dip and when I told them we didn't order artichoke dip that is when we were informed that it was actually the charge for the side of queso I was shocked. I should have been informed of the charge up front! I informed waitress & manager that I have ordered a side of queso before and that it came in the same little salsa container and was never charged $7.99. The manager made me feel as though I was lying as she said ""oh no it never comes like that."" Well sorry to say it did!! Also steak came out full of a lemon sauce after it was requested not to have any sauce. Very frustrating and will NOT return to Ephrata Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
2,Jack C.,"Washington, NJ",0,38,2.0,4.0,2017-11-07,Returning home from a business trip from Maryland we decided to stop for a early dinner. So we selected Applebee's. Great service by Morgan (I believe that was her name) and the food was very good. I ordered a full rack and my wife ordered a chicken dish. Everything was very good. Hey even the bathroom was clean. Loved the themed decorations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
3,Chastity C.,"Ephrata, PA",30,1,,1.0,2018-01-09,"I have been going here since it opened. It has its good days and it's bad but I was there this Saturday with my family and it was the worst. Took longer for our onion ring appetizers to come out than my husband, father in-law and brother entrées to come out.y husband ordered their Riblets which they ran out of sauce for, and they were cold. He wasn't offered another plate. I only ordered a Caesar salad which came out so hot my lettuce was wilted also I didn't get my salad until 12 mins after everyone else got their food ( three cheese chicken Cavitopi, fish and chips, and riblets) my brothers order was supposed to have no tomato's, and grilled shrimp. They brought him with tomatoes and fried shrimp. They took his plate to someone else after my brother held the plate. And they brought him the right one which was also sitting in the back getting cold. Our waiter didn't come and ask us for refills or even how everything was. Honestly so dissatisfied we just wanted to get out so as soon as we left I had to call for carry out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ephrata-2,,,,,
