32,C B.,"New York, NY",125,780,485.0,4.0,2012-03-19,"My review for both Applebees is essentially the same since their food is highly standardized and always lives up to the same quality in every location. The only thing I would add to the W 11th location is that, one of the few times I ate at this one rather than the one that's closer to me, I had excellent customer service. I arrived 20 minutes before my husband, and one of the servers kept me entertained with a great discussion about literature! For the type of restaurant Applebees is, you actually get very decent food here at a fair price. And my god are the portions HUGE. You can fill up on a single appetizer. Heck, two people can fill up on some appetizers, like the artichoke spinach dip which is fabulous if a bit on the salty side sometimes because of the added salt on the chips. (I think they fry the chips fresh, in house!) If you're on a diet, Applebees is one of the few restaurants in town that has a special menu with low cal, low fat, low carb dishes that are almost as good as their regular food. I like to get the steak skewers with broccoli and rice, which, while not as rich as the things I'd normally get (for example their magnificent orange chicken bowl), also comes in at about a quarter the calories so you can feel good about what you ate. Applebees is also home to the most sinful cocktails ever, the kind of things full of creamy liquers, heavy cream, chocolate, cookie crumbs, etc. If you're taking a day off from healthy eating, you can definitely indulge in their cocktails, shakes and desserts.  The only sort of bad experience I ever had at an Applebees was when we waited a full HOUR at lunch in a relatively quiet restaurant (under 50% capacity) for our food, despite asking for it twice. And even after that hour, only ONE appetizer came, and still no entrees. We finally asked for the manager, who apologized profusely. We explained our lunch break was over, so she offered to wrap up everything and send it home with us for free. And since we were already hungrily eating the one appetizer we did get, she gave us an additional appetizer of that kind to go. So we ended up getting three appetizers and two entrees, entirely free.  Had the event ended differently, as it may well have in another restaurant, we might never have gone back to Applebees. Instead, we remember favorably how nice and apologetic they were about their mistake, and how incredibly generously they had made up for it. Take note, local restaurant proprietors! Now THAT is good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

This is my go-to spot when my mom wants to grab food and isn't feeling ""adventurous"" and just wants chain diner like options. I appreciate that they have a ""Weight Watchers"" endorsed section. That doesn't mean the sodium isn't terrifying of course but at least the calories are somewhat in check.  This is a place I can go to and drink stupid drinks with stupid names without feeling weird ordering them. This is a plus because sometimes you just want a place you can drink a hurricane with your hamburger and feel OK about your choice afterwards.

27,B A.,"Eugene, OR",1,65,11.0,2.0,2013-12-03,"We asked the kids where they wanted to go to dinner, and they asked to go to Applebees. Thankfully it was Kids Eat for $.99 night. They ordered the sliders, which were basically tiny dry patties on a dry bun. My husband ordered a steak, which came out totally overlooked and he compared it to a TV Salisbury steak dinner in quality. He gave me a bite and honestly, it had no flavor. At all. I ordered the new Tequila Tango shrimp over chicken. The sauce is supposed to be an avocado sauce. The bell peppers and onions were very flavorful, and the rice under the chicken, as well. I thought I was off to a good start! But no. The sauce was strange, tart and tasted like someone threw some ingredients together, but didn't check to see if it tasted good. The chicken was totally overcooked.  Years ago I didn't mind their food so much, but it really has been going downhill.

8,Stephanie M.,"Eugene, OR",457,136,368.0,4.0,2015-11-16,"Okay dad wanted to go here for his birthday.  First of all the location is nice but the Gateway location feels a bit more upscale.  That being said it was perfect for us for a Sunday lunch.  The HUGE screen TV was placed on the channel we wanted to watch so we could watch the game for our group...  Richard was our server.  He was a hustler and moved around quickly.  He was a bit too busy though so much of our table thought he was slow.  He was VERY quick to serve me though for some reason so absolutely NO complaints here.   I love the new Blackberry Honey Tea -- not a fan that I only get one refill so I convinced them to give me regular iced tea thereafter (I am a huge tea drinker).   I LOVE the french onion soup here.  Always have.  For some reason my cheese fell into the soup and wasn't broiled like normal on top but it was in the bowl so I am not complaining.  The presentation of it just simply wasn't up to their par... Flavor was spot on.  The house salads we all got were small for a side salad that cost $4 and certainly wasn't up to their standard size but the toppings were awesome and it even comes with bacon.  Sweet potato fries were great to start with!  Cooked perfectly and served with 3 dipping sauces which is fun. Seemed the sweet one was the hit but I preferred the savory sauces myself.  I got the mac n cheese with tenders because I had been eyeing that meal for ages.  Convinced mom to do a 2 for $25 deal so it worked out well and she got the riblets she wanted. The mac n cheese had GREAT flavor.  There were some pretty big chunks of bacon FAT it in which made me gag because it looked like the noodles but certainly was NOT.  I wouldn't order this again but not because of the lack of flavor.  I think I am just a kraft gal.  Dad's steak was cooked perfectly and was tender and full of flavor.  The potato serving was more generous than expected.  Mom and aunt loved the brownie bites.  Great flavor and served warm with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. GREAT value for $1.49.  I am not a sweets fan but it is awesome.  They give a military discount, birthday discount and also a church discount which is cool -- each is 10% you can only use one of course -- but love this!   I will be back but I am still a huge fan of the Oriental Chicken Salad the most!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Instead I notice 2 waitress chatting it up with the bartender and hanging out. Finally, we left and reduced that this particular Applebees is off of our list. Our 7 year is son was very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
9,Ginger Y.,"Beaverton, OR",96,2,,5.0,2017-07-23,"This was my first experience at Applebee's and I was very impressed! I was greeted so delightfully by the lovely host Madison, she was very upbeat and helpful. I left my togo box and she ran outside to give it to me! LOVED that. My food was really good quality, quick service and overall a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
6,Sarah L.,"Beaverton, OR",0,1,,5.0,2017-08-24,Service was very prompt and amazing. Our server Lucy was fantastic. They went out of their way to cater to my diet restrictions. My alcoholic sister loves their drink menu. She had 6 different drinks and loved them all. Would definitely come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
3,Jordyn G.,"Eugene, OR",171,67,2.0,1.0,2017-10-07,"For the sake of a counter argument the place was packed but... it took just as long to get our appetizers as it did to get our drinks.. one round of drinks we ordered we never even got. Our server must have never ordered them because we weren't charged either. All of our food came out burnt and wrong. They took everything back to the kitchen even the two orders that were right., so when we did get everything back it was cold and all they had done to adjust things was scape topping off the buns and move the blackened burger to a new bun. The manager brought out our food the second time and never once apologized. We had waited an hour and 15 minutes for our food. I've been a server for many years before and the number one rule is the kids eat first... well his meal came last. Third time here with bad service I won't be back and I urge others to try the other location in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
1,Ben W.,"Ontario, OR",0,4,1.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"We waited 50 mins for food when it was pretty dead. Three of us got steaks and they were dry, undercooked,  and completely different sizes. The Caesar salad had ranch and was half the size of the house salad. I ordered the fireball whiskey burger, so I only have myself to blame for that. Imagine a western bacon burger with fake cinnamon all over it. Best part of the experience: laying down sick beats in the bathroom with the broken faucet and paper towel dispenser. Boom - bang - reeeeeeee",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Diane P.,"Eugene, OR",0,9,,1.0,2017-12-18,"We had one of our worst meals ever here last week.  I can't fault the server, but our food took forever to arrive, and when it did, one entree (the bourbon chicken whatever) was WAY overdone, like it had been under the lights for 20 minutes, and the other entree (sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes) was cold in the middle. Besides the issues with prep, both entrees were tasteless.  There was no hint of garlic in the mashed potatoes, and no hint of bourbon in the bourbon chicken.   We almost left and went to Wendy's, conveniently located across the street - wish we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eugene-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
