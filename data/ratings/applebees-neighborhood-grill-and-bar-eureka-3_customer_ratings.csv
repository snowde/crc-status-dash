No one refilled my water, I waved two waiters down twice to simply ask how much longer they might think... and they'd say they would check and never return. When we finally got our food, our waitress (who finally appeared after an hour and a half, seriously) gave us the check right away and didn't even say thanks.

Our dinner arrived before our appetizer, which we had to ask for because ""it was pushed off to one side and I forgot it."" Ok, so things happen. The food quality was awful.

We watched them wipe it down then... 10 minutes later we were allowed to sit.  Another 10 minutes, and the manager finally came to our table to take our drink and app order.  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  It came with salt.  Our server didn't show up until our appetizer and drinks were on the table.  Food came out in a timely fashion and was delivered by a very young food runner.  We ordered 2 more drinks, both of those came without salt like I originally asked.  We finished our food and drinks and waited around for our server to notice that we wanted to leave.  By the time we got our bill I was pretty annoyed and only left a 10% tip.  Idk if they give their servers too many tables or too little training, but I can pretty much guarantee terrible service and ok food if you go here.  Don't go here on a date, the shit service will kill the mood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

The kids activity sheets are going to need to have a lot more activities on them if all three kids are going to stay occupied for an hour.  They complained after about 30 minutes because they were hungry, bored, and generally displeased with having to wait forever.  It was the longest meal I've ever been involved in.  This applebees experience sucked.  The food wasn't bad, (not fantastic though either) and our server (even tho she took forever) gave my daughter an ice cream because she overheard me talking to her about a birthday meal I would cook her because she didn't like the steak she ordered.  Glad she overheard me talking and was paying attention because it was the only thing that night that made my daughter smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

The floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, the walls and blinds were covered in gunk and dirt and even food! Eeeek! I couldn't even keep an appetite. Made me wonder what the kitchen looked like. Regardless, we ordered, our server was nice. I got a four cheese mac and he got a club sandwich. They weren't very busy but the food took way too long. Once we got it, the food wasn't warm and my mac and cheese was more like soup and tasteless. His club sandwich was so soggy he couldn't eat it and it all fell apart. I felt bad for our server so I wanted to talk to the manager but she was interviewing a prospective employee in the lobby in front of guests. We barely ate and paid the check and left. I'm horrified. I will never eat there again. If it was just a busy day and their chef was not on his game that's one thing. But as a restaurant manager myself, the cleanliness was shocking. There has to be a health code violation for this place. I've always loved Applebee's but I will never go to this location again.

21,Steve C.,"Auburn, WA",10,105,182.0,2.0,2017-12-24,"We stopped at this Applebee's location for lunch on our way north bound on Hwy 101.  The French Onion soup I started with was very good with a rich flavor. The restaurant wasn't quite full, but the food did take some time to arrive.  My better half 's Fish and Cole slaw was done beautifully, with the fish fried golden brown and tender and moist. Compared to my sirloin steak which was rather chewy with gristle. The starch on the plate which was potato tots on a bed of mash potato didn't quite work well together.   Service was minimal. Our server passed our table a few times without stopping to check to see if things were alright.  At the end of our meal, with the credit card transaction, a 20% gratuity was suggested after the total amount which we did not quite agree with the service we received.The total bill comes up on the trivia game machine on the table. You swipe your credit card into this machine and a 20% tip is calculated for you.  If this is the business practice with Applebee restaurants in place, in a way it helps encourage a slack in service practice from their employees without providing their best to customers and just take things for granted!

They said yes, walked to the back and grabbed our food and specifically said the extra dressing is in there with the salad. We should know better but we assumed we were safe, drove to our hotel only find there was no salad and, understandably at this point, no extra dressing.

I wanted slightly better than fast food but not expensive restaurant prices so I chose Applebee's. I knew what I expected to get. So I ordered food on the phone so I could pick up and go to the hotel room, sit in my pjs and relax. As we arrived we were jovially greeted by a waitress. She was quick and efficient. I sat there for about ten minutes (I showed up early so I expected to wait) and watched waitresses cycle out the door for their smoke break. Eventually we got our food, paid the fair price and drove home. Upon setting out our food to dig in and enjoy I was greeted by several surprises. My first surprise is I had not received what I ordered. I asked for a chicken club and got a chicken burger. I guess it's kinda the same right? I mean they both have chicken... and bread.... well trying to be laid back I figured it was no big deal. Then I got my Second surprise..... we got a chicken oriental salad. Apparently they thought I wanted it rare. Cause that's how they served the ""crispy chicken."" In all fairness it was crispy on the outside so they technically told the truth. But the chicken was completely raw in the middle. So all in all if you want a low priced meal in this town I would think about looking somewhere else.
