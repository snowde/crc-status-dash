8,Jenny M.,"Apopka, Orlando, FL",2,2,,1.0,2014-11-22,Service was terrible. I do not expect amazing food at Applebee's but I expect decent service. Both were horrendous. I would recommend skipping this one if you are in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
4,Kim C.,"Leesburg, FL",0,1,1.0,1.0,2014-12-31,New Years Eve and we decided to eat here with our 9 y/o daughter. It was the worst experience I have ever had dining out. We arrived after 9:00 pm and there was no wait. Only about 10 tables with guest. Manager came and took our order. Drinks and Appetizers came fine and then everything fell apart. Our entrees were all mixed up. To add to the mess they had karaoke and a bunch of kids running around in and out of the kitchen. Will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
7,Meredith C.,"Mount Dora, FL",37,37,11.0,1.0,2015-03-13,let's just say that I will never eat here again... food was bad but not horrible service was also bad but not horrible but I would not waste my money here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,

6,C S.,"Encinitas, CA",1,13,7.0,1.0,2016-01-22,"I was visiting my aunt in Florida. I hadn't seen her in many years since I live in California and I wanted to take her to Applebee's to celebrate our reunion. We both ordered steak and my aunt ordered hot tea and I ordered water with lemon. After waiting fir our drinks for 20 minutes I decided to ask someone could we get our drinks and finally someone bright them out. When we finally received our food we both noticed that the food was cold and my steak wasn't cooked correctly. Nothing worse then a cold steak right. So we asked that my aunts steak be heated up and asked that my steak to be done over and cooked right this time. The waiter was very rude. He didn't once come to the table to ask us if everything was alright or if we needed anything. When I flagged him down to asked him to bring my aunt another hot tea the waiter swished his hand at me and rolled his eyes and said ""yeah in a minute"" it was the worst service I have ever had in my life and I'm 49 years old. I can see why this Applebee's has a low star rating. They need to get a new waiter with better customer service. A waiter who will make sure to bring the food to the customer when it's hot. Please hire someone who cares about the customers and your business. I had just arrived after a long flight and wanted to relax and enjoy a meal with my aunt and this Applebee's made this impossible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
1,SM P.,"Tavares, FL",0,11,167.0,5.0,2017-01-27,"Tonight was a good night! Sometimes it is a miss at this location depending on who is serving and who is cooking, but tonight was spot on. Everyone's food was cooked perfectly and came out quickly even though they were super packed already (5:30 on a Fri). Also, the servings were appropriate, I've been here for lunch many times in the past and whoever was cooking would short you on whatever you ordered like half filled french onion soup to almost nothing on a sandwich or half the amount of fries you're supposed to get, it would piss me off!! We sat in the bar area (where you can seat yourself, no need to wait!) and our server was awesome. He never let us run out of drinks. The bar area does seem to have the best service because you've really got two to three ppl waiting on you, one taking orders and getting drinks and other ppl running food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
2,Joshua F.,"Eustis, FL",15,19,4.0,1.0,2017-02-25,"If I could give a worse star review I would!! My friends and I have been here three different times and ALWAYS we wait an hr for food the lady with the sleeve SUCKS as a waitress. The food is always good and everyone else I've felt with with but the food takes FOREVER with the lady with the sleeve!! We all had to ask three times for re-fills on our drinks, the place wasn't even busy. This is just crazy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
0,Lillian R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,2.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"Went there for dinner tonight. Our server was great. The Butcher's Meat and Potatoes looked delicious, so my husband and I both ordered it... the picture on the menu is deceiving, to say the least. There is a picture from their menu, and a picture of what I was served. I put the fork on my plate for size comparison. There were exactly 6 tiny pieces of meat. One small scoop of potatoes, a few skinny slices of mushroom, some stewed tomatoes, a few fried onions on top. I'm pretty sure the gravy was juice from the can of stewed tomatoes. When you compare the two pictures, it's shameful. We would have been better off getting a burger, at the very least, it would have been more filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eustis-3,,,,,
