31,Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114.0,4.0,2012-05-16,"I wanted to update my review as the locations new general manager reached out to me in regards to an email I sent to the company. John, the manager, provided a sincere interest in learning more about the situation that occurred during my recent visit. John was kind, professional and agreeded that the service was not as it should have been. He offered to make the situation correct for me, which normally when I complain (which is very seldom), I dont accept; however, due to the situation the first time, I accepted. On my return visit, John personally thanked me for taking the time to let him know about the situation. My server this time, Cora, provided truly incredible service. She was personable, friendly, efficent and left a great impression of what five star service should be. Cora always had a smile on her face, built great rapport with other bar guests and had an upbeat ready to provide legendary service attitude. With the great leadership of John and outstanding service at the bar from Cora , I am know happy to return to this location. The food quality was also exceptionally better, the wings had at least three times the amount of sauce and tasted as fresh as possible. The strawberry cheesecake shooter dessert was of wonderful size and flavor, something I highly recommend, Thank you Applebees for taking the time and interest in correcting when something goes wrong and proving that this is a place I would be happy to take friends in the area in the future.  This would be a five star review, expect for the fact, I believe that because the first visit did occur, a star should be noted...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=20,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
59,Lala L.,"Everett, WA",140,1,,1.0,2012-08-11,"I would give it 0 star if I could! I had the 2 for $20 for dinner tonight, I order a medium well 9 oz steak with mashpotates and fries, boyfriend had the chicken strip basket., and our appititzer was boneless wings.  After our food was brought out my steak was raw and extra bloody with mashpotatoes and veges when I asked for fries. They said my fries will come out right away, but they didnt come out till another 10 extra minutes. The fries weren't even fresh!!! They were a little bit above warm and bit soggy. I ask to speak to manager name Tasha from one server, she didn't come! so I had to ask another server because I was unhappy with my services and meal. I look across the room and saw the manager chatting it up with her co-workers and whatever she was doing that didn't look so important that she didn't come check on my table for another 10 minutes when I was an unhappy customer and had a complant! WOW such terrieble services.  After 20 minutes of waiting my steak was replaces for a new one that was OVER COOKED! After that I didn't even bother to say anything I was just so tired and feeded up. I waited for my food for over 40 minutes and got nothing out of it. After the manager came back and checked on my new steak, asked how it was and I told her it was over cooked she gave me an additude and said in a very unprofessional, rude way ""I guess we'll just pay for your steak tonight!"" and walked away. I took 3 bites of my food and ask for the check and my bill was around $16 something instead of $20 something they said. 2 for $20 plus a $2 upgrade for the steak . so they should of have taken of half of that cause that was half of my meal but instead they charged us with the $10 chicken strip basket, made us pay for the appetizers that came with our 2 for $20 meal so our check was around $16 something.  I was not happy with the food or services but was still kind enough to leave the server a nice tip because she was nice trying to make sure that I got my steak and that it was cooked the way I asked.

The cook was able to mess them up!! When they arrived they were raw inside!!!  We sent them back and waited a while for the new order to come out. When thy did, they were completely charred!! Service was not that great either. Our waiter made a once in a while appearance and was not detailed oriented. We asked for water with lemon and you guessed it the water arrived without the lemon!

47,Patrick S.,"Bothell, WA",1,49,,4.0,2014-04-11,"This review is for curbside to go. I'll start with the call to order. The lady who answered the phone was very courteous and asked a couple good questions to ensure I got what I wanted such as sauce options and making sure I wanted the full size as opposed to half. I was then told it would be 14 minutes. I was there right around the 14 minute mark and the food was brought out promptly within 2-4 minutes of parking, so excellent timing considering I ordered a full $18 rib and crunchy shrimp dinner. The lady who brought it out greeted me and asked how I was doing and was genuinely friendly. Overall, service was definitely 5 stars.  The food isn't fantastic, but it's good for the price, so it's hard to take away stars based on what this restaurant is striving for (not being a world class restaurant). The fries are good, but aren't super fresh, but again, not expecting truffle fries like some people haha. The shrimp wasn't the most flavorful, but who can expect a $13 order of shrimp to be like the specialty seafood restaurants right off the water? My wife had the ribs, so I'm not sure on those, but she seemed to enjoy them. All in all, the food is decent, the service was great, and the punctuality was right on, so I'd recommend this location. I still recommend Red Robin for overall food over this (for the same class of restaurants), but this was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16

48,Kristi W.,"Mill Creek, WA",55,45,40.0,2.0,2014-07-31,Not impressed with this Applebee's. We've always had decent service by the severs but it always seems to take forever to get food once ordered. Couple weeks ago we did take out and it took over 45 minutes to get our order brought out. No one ever told us any updates or what was going on. I kept asking and no answers. When we got home our food was cold. Had to put it in the microwave.  So disappointed. I called and spoke to the manager explained our whole situation and he really kept giving excuses as to just how busy it was and tables were waiting too. BTW I was sitting in the waiting area for 45 min and saw all the tables that got there around the same time I did and they all received there food and finished before I even received my order. I told the manager it was a lame excuse and communication is key! The dining room was not all that full either. I should have just left but I hate doing things like that. Needless to say the only way this particular Applebee's made me somewhat happy was they sent us a voucher for our next meal. Well we used that voucher last night at the Applebee's off of Everett mall way and it was perfect service and great food. We won't be back to this Applebee's however.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=40,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

Got so packed that the staff got overwhelmed and look like they don't know what they are doing. I asked the manager or what looked like the person in charge for ketchup and he gave me the ugliest look. I asked for a desert menu and it's taken up to 15 min for my waiter to come and ask me what I would like.

They brought Luke warm soup and when I asked if we could return it it was apparent we were annoying our server.

I stood there a few min before someone noticed me and they didn't look very busy from what I could see. The guy brought me my food and started to walk away. I then told him I haven't payed yet. He acted confused when I said that. I handed him the cash and just walked out. I had ordered Thai shrimp salad. Well I get home and there is hardly any salad there.

It's pretty hard to mess up French fries.) On the upside, they have great happy hour specials and lots of tvs to watch the game. Their pub pretzels are also surprisingly tasty.

We (My wife, her sister and I) went for Monday Night Football and 1/2 burgers. I ordered a Brunch Burger, the waitress asked if I want to add onion rings for $1 more, sure.  When it arrived, there were 4 rings on my plate.  Yes, 4 rings.  I commented to the server, he said that was normal, I made a comment about it being ridiculous.  Really, 4 rings on an upsell? I took a photo for this post. I asked that our waitress come by the table.  Before that could happen, the manager promptly delivered 4 more. They did the right thing, they fixed their ridiculous portion size.  The second mis-cue occurred.  My sister in law asked for her steak to be extremely rare, it arrived of course medium well.  The manager came by to see how we were doing, she pointed out her over-cooked steak.  The manager promptly returned with a  whole new steak dinner, very rare. very good.  Her entire meal was free (we did not ask). So, 2 out of 3 meals were delivered sub-par; however, the manager stepped up and did the right thing (we did need the steak for free) and made out meals right. We spent 3 hours in the bar eating, drinking and watching football.  Our original waitress was very friendly as was the entire staff. Yes, the brunch burger was great (however, not a heart healthy meal), the onions rings were great, and the second steak was perfect. Will I return?

Food is your standard frozen food that's spiced up to look like fresh food. It was close, and I was hungry. New menu, or to me at least, isn't that appealing. The table tablet thing at the table made cringe. Anyways, the Dishwash on staff that night did a thorough job of cleaning the plates. No specks of previous food on the plate. No signs of mold residue, or anything sickly. Food is Applebee's quality. Took me at least 5 minutes to be seated in the desolate place. Server, Saul, didn't refill the drinks, or didn't bother to ask. Attempted to take my plate when he assumed I was done with it, again without asking.

We've see the commercials and thought that we would give it a try. Our server (Kianni) was wonderful. We were seated promptly and in a great spot. The place was pretty quiet for lunch time on a weekday and that should have been our first clue. My husband ordered the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad and I had the Lunch Combo: 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and the Clubhouse Grille. My food tasted like it had been cooked yesterday and warmed up the microwave to luke-warm. The flavor was awful. The salad would have been the better way to go, but even that was not tasty.  I can see that this place may be great to hang with friends on game day, when you've had some beers are only expecting bar-food standards. But, sad to say, we won't be going to this or any other Applebee's in the future for lunch or dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

Then we ordered the take 2 and both got the oriental ck salad. It was just horrible. The veggies were black and we mostly got the bread crumbs and very little salad. It made up probably around 90 percent of the dish. The sauce we not the regular size dish but the puny one and when we asked for more the waitress was giving us a look like really.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

We all ordered burgers and a little later our server said if we needed anything else, ask the other servers because she was ending her shift soon. She was very nice and served us well, even constantly refilling our waters without us having to ask. We were feeling a bit hungry so we called a server using the tablet on the table, and it was flashing red. There were 2 or 3 servers not too far from us talking with each other, and they saw our tablet flashing. They ignored us and started talking to themselves once again. Our original server came back and served us right before she left, and I was extremely thankful for that. Food was mediocre, fries were cold, and burger buns were covered in oil. I would have given them 1 star if it wasn't for our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

There used be some really cool posters on the walls a few years back, but the new remodel, in my opinion, is a downgrade.     Anyway, me and my female friend went in for some late night food. We were expecting to be waiting for awhile to get our appetizers but they came out right away. Our food followed shortly after. We were shocked since the service has never been that good. Our server was attentive and outgoing. We had a great time as we overheard the drunks in the bar yammering. The food was good for an Applebee's and we left with our expectations exceeded.

My reason for writing this review is to bring Applebee's attention to customers that are vegan. One of my granddaughters is vegan and asked our waiter for some help. She asked for a baked potato but was told they only serve them at dinner time. How long would it have taken to nuke a potato for her? After some discussion and thought she was able to have them fix something for her. With more and more people going vegan, it would be helpful to have a place on your menu for those people who eat no meat and also may have allergies to dairy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

We had bad/cold food the two other times we had gotten food from here, but I figured we could give it another chance. Two of us got sweet potato fries which consisted of about 10 cold fries in the bottom of the container. I posted a picture. It looks like the tossed someone's leftovers in there.

The rating was more based on the service vs the food.  Everything was ok until she came to the table and said use the tabletop computer to pay.  She was nice and friendly about it but the expectation to do no more work since we were done eating.  I took that to mean I'm too lazy to bring you a check and process your payment.  I normally do utilize this to pay to make it easier on the server especially when they are busy.  She had one other table besides us and her goal seemed to be to chat with coworkers rather than service customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-everett-6,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
