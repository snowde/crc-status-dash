167,Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",200,262,225.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"My friends and I planned a dinner originally at Red Robin. The wait time there was only an hour :/ and we were starving, so a few people went to Buffalo Wild Wings and others went to Applebee's to check wait times. Buffalo Wild Wings also had an hour wait and Applebee's only had five minutes! So, Applebee's instead! We went in and sat at our table and immediately the server asked us for drinks. I have never been here before so I was wondering what food they have. There wasn't much that was considered healthy, even the salads were high in calories! I ordered an under 500 calorie meal with chicken, potatoes, and steamed veggies since the description sounded delicious! After 20 minutes or so, she came back to get our orders. After ordering, we probably waited about 30 minutes for our food, but we all really didn't pay attention since we were all talking about random stuff like school and work and life. I really enjoyed my time with them. Once we got our food, someone had a mix up. One of my friends was given the wrong meal and asked for the correct version. My plate was small considering it was $12... All my friends got double what I got and paid $12... I realized I shouldn't even be looking at calorie counts since most of the food was too big to eat in one sitting. Our waitress appeared to have been annoyed because she was giving us a bit of an attitude. It didn't really matter to us because we were not even paying attention to her. We stayed after eating for a bit. They took a really long time for our checks, and they didn't even pick up the orders that were in exact change. We just left it at the table. There was a good vibe here, and I'd like to come another day! But they do need more and better food choices because they didn't have much that I wanted. And more healthier plates too! The prices for the healthier options were ridiculous for the plate size. At least lower it down to compare it to the larger size plates. If the larger sized plates were put in smaller sizes, they would have been very similar to the healthier plates. But, at least it was a good first experience and I know what to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=160,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.0600000000000005,2.12
148,Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",65,298,134.0,4.0,2012-01-10,I have to say that I am a fan of applebee's and I haven't left any of their establishments disappointed. Their food is very good for the most part and the drinks are very decent as well. The 20 dollars is a good deal if you want to stay in a budget and the options are very tasty. I come to this particular one whenever I want to eat something before or after going to the movies and don't feel like driving somewhere else and have always experienced very good service from the hosts as well as from the waitress and waiters.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=140,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.192,2.16
182,Shari D.,"Oakland, CA",5,12,2.0,2.0,2012-01-19,"I just had 1 of my worst restaurant experiences at Applebee's in Fairfiled, Ca. My son in law is in boot camp so decided to take daughter and 3 grandkids with a few others to Applebee's to cheer her up. There were 8 of us in total, 4 adults, 4 kids. I sign in at 6 pm. and ask wait time as you know how little ones can be. He tells me 15 min. So we wait. 25 min go by and see tables of 4 pass us by. Wondering why cant they put 2 tables together? Host walks up and tells me there waiting for 1 particular party to get up.Another 10 min.kids are crying, table still occupied. Host says found another table where they can put 2 together but waiting on 1 of those tables. At 48 min of waiting, I tell host "" look its been 48 min. if you had told me this on the front end we would of left,{ as my party had asked me to do already a few times} I would like to speak to your manager. He takes off with 2 of his colleagues. 5 min. goes by, he comes back, table is ready! We get seated. We wait 8 min. no waitress. 1 of our party see's manager and approaches him. He tries to tell manager what we have just gone thru, kids still crying as there HUNGRY, and manager Tom I believe his name was, grabs Mike by the arm, not roughly, but you shouldnt put your hands on a customer and tells him to remain calm and they would be right with us. Now Mike was calm, just trying to explain and make manager aware. Not so calm after manager puts hands on him, lol, waitress arrives and she was great, food comes, mine was good, after about 15 min.into meal manager comes to table asks if all is ok. No apologies, no comps. nothing! As my friends know I myself am a manger of a store, this was the WORST customer service and not the way anyone should be treated! Just thought you should know there was no caring for this customer from Applebee's lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=180,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.9600000000000002,2.2
161,Tiffany V.,"Fairfield, CA",78,11,8.0,1.0,2012-02-20,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that my co-workers and I used to come here often for late-night happy hour.  Cheap appetizers and drinks were a perfect match for me, but as of late the quality of service has gone down tremendously.   After a long hiatus, my boyfriend and I decided to give Applebee's a shot. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes before our server came over to take our drink orders; a long island, a margarita, and a round of waters, and we asked her to return for our appetizer order.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more and she finally returned to take our food orders.  We placed that, and she walked away again.  30 minutes from when we were seated, we finally received our first round of drinks, albeit without the waters.  Before I could make mention of it, she was gone again.  My boyfriend tasted his drink, and it was absolutely awful.  Now for $3.29 I'm not expecting the best drinks in the world, but I am expecting something that we could drink.  We tried to flag her down, but she did not come around to check on us, and when she was at the table on the opposite side of the partition, it was as if she couldn't see us trying to get her attention.  20 minutes later (50 minutes from our initial sit down time), our appetizers finally came out and as our server was starting to run away again, I called her back to again ask for waters, for appetizer plates for our newly acquired food and to point out the fact that his drink was not good and to ask for a re-fire.  She said no problem, and ran off.  15 minutes later, a food runner came with his drink, dropping it off and disappearing.  One taste of it and again, it was no good.  This time it tasted like it was the same drink that they let sit on the counter for a bit then refreshed the ice.  The drink was completely watered down.  We glanced around the dining room, and did not see our server again, but fortunately another server that we were familiar with was passing by and had stopped at our table to say hi.  We told him the issue, and he went and found our server and again had her re-fire the drink.  An hour and a half from when we arrived, my boyfriend got drink number 3 and upon tasting it it was STILL WRONG!!   Our food was long gone (and we had to eat off the serving plates because we never received our appetizer plates), no waters, and he hadn't even received a decent drink.   Then another girl walked up and told us that our server had to go home early, so she would be taking over.  I asked for our bill, and told her about how his drink was still incorrect.  She offered to just take the drink off the bill for us, which hey, I'm not opposed to since we sat around for nearly 2 hours and he didn't even get to consume one, and she promptly brought the bill.  I checked the total, $21.  Not bad, but upon thinking about it, that didn't make any sense.  I had 1 drink, the quesadilla, and the boneless wings (after having his drink removed from the bill) so how it came that high was beyond me.  At this point, we asked to speak with the manager.  10 minutes later, he comes mozying on over, like he's taking a Sunday stroll.  I outline all of the issues we had with that night and said it made zero sense how our bill was so high.  He (Tom I think his name was) tried to talk down to me, telling me that my math had to be incorrect because there was no way that the computer could be wrong.  I busted out my calculator and added the figures IN FRONT OF HIM and to his dismay, he was incorrect.  He then started to make excuses for the server, how she was dealing with family issues so she was having a bad night to which I quickly quipped back with the fact that I'm there to receive a service, and not be a therapist, so the was neither here nor there.  I don't need excuses, I need the service I'm paying for to be correct.  Not once was an apology given.  In total, 2 hours from being seated to reconciling our bill. In closing, I will never be returning to this location, especially since was not the first time that they attempted to over charge me (one time, a $40 bill somehow mysteriously got charged on my card as $93, and it took over a week for me to get my money back).  I've been here more times than I can count, spending more money than I'd like to admit, but with the service that we received (and how it's declined greatly over the past months) I'd rather go to Red Robin or Chevy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=160,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.924,2.16

169,TIm D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,,4.0,2012-06-03,"The place is underrated, in my humble opinion. Years ago when we first ate here we were underwhelmed, but since the big chef makeover a few years back, the food has been quite scrumptious... way better than you might expect in this setting. The service is generally quite personable... Once in a while we've had to wait or the food has arrived on the cool side. Lots of low-calorie choices that are still very tasty. The steaks are particularly good, and they're not afraid to serve it rare when asked.

Ordered water and a brewtus for me. Got the water right away. But took an additional 15 minutes to get my beer. The waiter that brought us our water when I asked about it said ""I don't get the beer"" About 10 minutes later our order was taken. My son ordered the ultimate trio I ordered the appetizer sampler. After 30 minutes we FINALLY got our food. I then asked for another beer. Now here is the frustrating part. The waiter that said ""I don't get the beer"" is the person that brought me my second beer. By now I couldn't finish the second beer due to time constraints. Which frustrated me. I don't like to leave undrank beer. I will not be going back there for a long time.

95,Vicky L.,"Fairfield, CA",533,324,1874.0,4.0,2012-11-12,"My mom suggested to come here for lunch(Sunday, day before Veteran's day), which was odd bc she isn't a fan of American food(she's a chinese buffet aficionado). The reason--bc her friend was there & military/veterans would get a free lunch(pops is a veteran).  It was pretty busy when we got to restaurant, but we didn't have to wait bc mom's friend already had a table. Holler. The pops ordered the 7oz. steak w/ mashed potatoes & steamed veggies, mom and I ordered from the 2 for $20 section(2 full entrees +1 appy)-- Bourbon street chicken & shrimp, 3 cheese chicken penne, & spinach artichoke dip(sweet deal huh?). The spinach dip was good, but not the best I've had. The 3 cheese chicken penne was quite good with the diced tomatoes & shredded cheese, yummy. The pops really enjoyed the steak w/ the mashers, seriously--every 10 mins he was like, ""this is the best steak I've ever had...better than that Texas Roadhouse, theirs is so dry..."" then he would go back to watching the '9ers game, lol. I didn't taste the steak, but the mashers were pretty darn good(so good that I was scraping it off the plate), flavor & consistency were on point! My mom liked the chicken & shrimp dish-- she even finished the whole thing(well 85% of it..she gave me some of her chicken) I shoulda took a picture bc seeing her finish a plate at a restaurant is rare O___O(she usually eats less than half of her food & asks for a to-go box @ T. Roadhouse & then she goes and takes some of my steak fries(T___T).  Overall, this place is great. Good service, despite how busy it was, prices are reasonable(especially 2 for $20/$24 section) and the food was good. The only thing I would change is the weight of their plates--I almost snapped my wrist trying to fork my penne from a heavy plate into their unreasonably small to-go box -___x Definitely coming here again ^___^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.192,2.28
158,Nicole M.,"Petaluma, CA",81,19,3.0,1.0,2012-11-19,"Hands down, WORST service ever... I am a server myself so I am very understanding and patient with other servers when I go out to eat, BUT WOW.... We sat at a table in the bar area and were greeted by a very friendly young man who cracked jokes about the new ziosk (electronic waiter) with us, so we thought we lucked out with a good server... Unfortunately what he had in personality lacked poorly in service. I ordered a house margarita with no salt and asked for it in a pint glass. He brings me a martini glass with salt and an olive? I ordered a margarita dude, not a martini. Ok, fine... no big deal, just bring me a glass with no salt, ice and a straw. Warm glass brought, no ice, no straw. Umm, can you put some ice in this and bring me a straw? Glass with ice brought, no straw... I got up and got it myself. (We havent even ordered food yet). My bf orders a Cowboy Burger and is very clear that he does not want onions..... brought COVERED in onions. Rather than risk something else going wrong, he chooses to pick them off and asks for an iced tea. No iced tea ever brought to the table. We get a new server that informs us that she is taking over for the other guy. He takes this opportunity to ask again for an iced tea and I order another margarita with no salt. Margarita WITH salt brought to the table and no iced tea. WTF? I said nothing because at this point we were just irritated and wanted to see how long or if his iced tea would ever make an appearance. No such luck.  I made a point to ask our new server how much she has to pay out in tipshare at the end of her shift because I felt strongly that a tip was not deserved especially because the restaurant WAS NOT busy at all, how hard is your job?? She told me...10%!!! She blatantly lied to my face about how much she has to pay in tipshare because she thought I would leave a bigger tip. Well. I confirmed with the bartender that servers DO NOT pay 10%, They pay 2%. So, I asked for the manager. I wanted to explain to her how bad my service was and why I was only leaving 2% of the bill to cover tipshare so she didnt have to pay out of pocket for my crappy experience. The manager says ""Its ok, you don't have to tip her"". That was it!!! Lady, We shouldnt have had to even PAY... thank you for informing me that a tip wasn't required. Bottom line- I will never return to this Applebees again and will definately steer anyone I know in the direction of another establishment. No wonder they have electronic waiters on the table...

90,Candice S.,"Antioch, CA",9,292,,2.0,2013-01-27,"Oh man, I've had some truly fantastic times here... not. Applebee's seems like the place to go to once you live the movie theater. You just watched a great movie, you're kind of hungry and look, wouldn't you know, there's a restaurant right there! Right off the bat I knew something was suspect about this location just based on the way the layout was designed. It's like a puzzle. Like a very inconvenient puzzle and bless the person who dares to figure out where the restroom is. The service is abysmal. I've had two types of service: either they barely acknowledge you or they're never there. Which if you're trying to enjoy the experience makes it pretty darn hard to. A few times I've ordered food from the Weight Watchers selections and each time I noticed that the serving sizes were much larger than what they were supposed to be. I did Weight Watchers for two years and the portions they gave us at this location was nowhere near what they should have been. It was practically triple the size and completely lacking in all flavor. I've had other non-WW dishes, like the steak and what not, but it was just so tough. This place is the dumps. I give it 1 star for convenient location and nice restrooms, if you can find it, but dear lord, never come here.

They were NOT garlic mashed potatoes. They didn't have any seasoning at all, and the vegetables? Were they supposed to be cooked? Because mine were raw.  The time before this I had a delicious burger. I was surprised the steak was so bad because my sister had it before and she said it was great. The drinks are also hit or miss.

Then I saw the same girl give a nearby table their food, and saw her smiling, and conversing with them shortly. I know she was not our server, but that was still incredibly rude!

The only reason I came here with my parents was to use up a gift card. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this place. The appetizer sampler is alright. Their spinach and artichoke dip is good, and you can't really go wrong with tortilla chips. The hot items on the plate, however, come out just warm (i.e. none of that ooey gooey cheesy goodness in the mozzarella sticks). Dad ordered the marsala mushroom sirloin and said it was just alright. We all had some trouble finishing our dishes. The service here isn't great either. Took quite a long time to flag our waitress down to get us the check.

105,M D.,"Napa, CA",2,103,18.0,1.0,2014-04-14,"This is one of those ""Why can't I give negative stars"" situations.  One star is too much for this dump. Let me start by saying that I recognize we're talking about Applebee's here, I'm not opposed to Applebee's at all, I've eaten at the one in my hometown many times.  It's nothing special, but it's OK.  So my reaction to this specific Applebee's isn't a result of me expecting it to be something it's not.  Applebee's is mediocre food in a chain-restaurant setting, I get it. But this particular location is just awful, even by Applebee's notably easy standards. A smallish group of us met here  for lunch about a week ago.  The restaurant is not busy, mind you, but the service was still atrociously slow and inattentive.  My wife ordered a Corona, it took nearly 30 minutes for it to finally arrive at our table.  30 minutes, for a bottle of beer.  The rest of the service was equally slow and inept, they just don't seem to care. But the real star of the show was the virtually inedible food.  There were 3 adults and 3 kids under 12 at our table, and not a single one of us finished our food.  About halfway through our meal (which took forever to come out) we all sort of slowed down eating... looked around the table... and nearly in unison said ""Is it just me or is this not very good?""  In all honesty every dish seemed like it had been cooked earlier in the day, refrigerated and then microwaved for our order.  Which does nothing to explain why it took 45 minutes for our food to come out when the restaurant is essentially empty. Even the kids meals (mini burgers, kids pizza x 2) were nearly inedible.  When a restaurant can't make a kid's cheese pizza that a kid will eat you know something has gone seriously off the rails.   My shadow will never darken the floor of this Applebee's again.  Terrible service, terrible food, why go here?  Hit a McDonalds on the way to the mall, it will be a million times better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=100,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.4760000000000002,2.36

147,Kristina H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,2.0,2015-03-15,"I'm going to start off with saying I'm never going to eat there again. We first got sat right next to the entrance and it seemed like it took ten mins before we were spoken to and even longer when we asked to be moved because of the high table. Our waitress was Caitlin P. and she seemed okay, only checked on us twice and seemed to gossip a lot with her coworkers but that was fine. Food came and my pasta was good, my brother and boyfriend said their chicken strips and burger tastes like it wasn't very good so we pay our bill, I ask for a to go box for my food and leave. I wasn't even to the parking lot when I realize I forgot my box on the table and when I came in to get HALF MY FOOD I PAID FOR, Caitlin tells me ""Oh I'm sorry we threw it away."" I ask really? You guys don't hold onto it for a few minutes? ""Yeah we don't, I thought it was weird you asked for a box and you left it, I thought you didn't want it so I threw it away. Sorry again."" And I just looked at her surprised and she just looked at me with a insincere smile. Upset I just said it's fine and walked out. Previously working in a restaurant myself, when people left HALF THEIR FOOD THEY PAID FOR on the table I hold it in the back for 15 minutes or so in case they return because WHY WOULD I ASK FOR A BOX IF I DIDNT WANT MY FOOD?? And if we did throw out someone's left overs we would make them fresh food Togo but I JUST GOT A ""OH IM SORRY.."" and a mental push out the door. If I could ask for my more then 15% tip back I would but loosing my service forever at Applebee's is good enough for me. So my tip to people who go there IF YOU FORGET YOUR LEFT OVERS ON THE TABLE DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WALKING BACK BECAUSE THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY YOU SPENT ON YOUR DINNER.

It sucked so bad that I feel awful knowing that my first meal of the day came from here, and I'm also kinda pissed that the experience wasn't so great for my mom on her birthday.  First of all, the food was disgusting. The appetizers we ordered were probably the only decent items, but you can't really screw up mozzarella sticks or onion rings. I ordered the chicken penne and noooooooo. God, no. I just got over a vegetarian phase after I accidentally ate raw chicken and now I want to go right back. It contained a mixture of dry pieces and mushy pieces so I don't really know how I feel about that. And I thought it was absolutely ridiculous how we got charged an extra $2 for a tiny cup of coleslaw.  Second of all, the service flat out sucked. I don't really want to directly call out our server (so I'll call her N) but I wasn't impressed. She greeted us, brought out our drinks, and asked for our order but we weren't really ready yet. THIS GIRL DISAPPEARED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. For WHY??? Yeah, thanks for the extra time but we were done in about 5 minutes. To be honest, I was surprised she actually came back because it seemed like she forgot about us. Also, refills were nonexistent. What is water. What is iced tea. And finally, when we were ready to go, she took our check and disappeared again. I caught her standing with the host with 3 other employees just talking near the entrance.

We ordered the wonton chicken tacos and the the kobe style meatballs for a appetizer. The tacos were ok, but they seriously need to add more chicken! But the bigger problem was the meatballs. My husband took one bite and spit it right out! Why? It was cold, i thought hey he likes his soup so hot that it burns his tongue on the well down, but when i touched it, it felt as if it wasnt even at room temperature, like it was taken out of the freezer. That was sent back. Now here comes the entree, I decided to go with the lunch combo, I ordered chicken fajita roll up. (Once again barely any chicken, the thing was pretty much stuff with just lettuce) and the 4 cheese mac and cheese w/ pepper chicken.

67,Heidi C.,"Vacaville, CA",32,52,2.0,2.0,2016-07-03,"Ah, the eternal quandary--where to eat near the Fairfield theater that will get you out in time to watch your movie, and have food and service that is decent.  We decided to give Applebees a whirl.  Yes, we were in and out in time for our movie; and yes, the food was pretty good with decent (albeit inexperienced) service.  So, mission accomplished.   However, while we were seated relatively quickly, I felt that the hostess staff was initially oblivious to new customers; they have some funky charity campaign going on, and all of their decorations completely obscures the hostess station and the hostesses were busy chatting 6 feet behind it.  The one who finally took us to our table seemed confused where she was going; it was like they had no map or computer program, but were winging it when they set guests up with tables.  Our server was very pleasant and personable, but seemed somewhat new.  We took a bit of time to figure out what we wanted, and she was patient with us and observant--she noted when we all folded our menus and was right over.  My kids enjoyed their dinners (a beef and potatoes entree, and a pork chop), which is a plus.  My husband said his ""triple hog dare you"" sandwich had too much going on to be really good; he liked it but won't get it again.  My salmon was delivered late; they brought out chicken first.  When I finally got it, the salmon was hot but was nearly overcooked--no hint of pink at all in the flakey flesh.  The ""steamed"" spinach was obviously microwaved, as it was dry and kind of sticking to the plate.  It didn't come with the sauce as advertised, I had to ask for it.  The broccoli was good, and their new maple sweet potatoes were really delicious. The really negative was oddball stuff.  The bathroom smelled funny and looked like the drain might have a habit of overflowing, there was water on the floor.  I swear my daughter's steak knife kept ""weeping"" water--I think there was water trapped between the layers of the knife handle, but when I took it from her to look closer, I couldn't replicate what had been happening when she cut her meat.  And, when we had finished but before we even got our bill, someone was there to clear the plates--that's fine, but she actually stacked up and took away our glasses, so we were left with a completely empty table while we waited for the bill!  I felt that they were really rushing us out the door; that, and I felt like the young lady doing the busing was very new, and didn't really think about how that made us feel.  Overall, feels like this place is full of very new staff who need a lot more training.  The food was totally passable, and it did get the job done--fed and happy, we hit the theater and enjoyed our movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=60,1.84,1.98,1.98,2.056,1.924

On the way out, I saw a server and I told her that employees take too long to seat customers and attend them, her excuse was that they didn't have enough people. To me as a customer, that was a very lame excuse. When there was a bunch of employees just walking passed us while we waited to be seated. All it takes is less than one minute to see somebody down! Honestly would not recommend this place to anybody, Very poor customer service for it not being busy !

After we sat down and put in our orders, we sat for over 30 minutes while customers who came in AFTER us received their food. My sister ordered her burger well done and once it arrived, it was completely pink inside so she had to wait another 10 minutes for her food. My food came with chips on the side, which Dominick forgot. When I ordered dessert and it came out, there were no spoons. My sisters dessert also came with no spoons so when we ALL requested some, keep in mind there were 4 of us, Dominick only brought 2. One of the spoons however, was REALLY dirty. It had some sort of dry gunk all over it, spinach I believe.  My sister in law went to the bar to get spoons and waited 5 minutes until someone noticed her. When the check came, Dominick forgot to remove one of the orders on the check. They overcharged us for our order. We had to wait over 10 minutes for the new check to come out because the manager was soooooo busy. Sorry, but there was just no excuse for it.  Service was unacceptable from start to finish and all Dominick really had to offer was excuses! Excuses of him being new and how the food on the spoon wasn't his fault, I could go on.  Ultimately we had to ask for the manager because this was just beyond a bad visit and we definitely won't be returning! We arrived at Applebee's before 12:30pm!! It's now after 2:30pm and we are waiting for a manager who doesn't want to deal with unhappy customers, those were Dominick's words! The manager did not want to come out!

If you're wanting something vegetarian to eat and you don't like mushrooms...good luck! I know I'm a picky eater but I feel the menu had more variety in the past. My friend ordered a pasta with shrimp and I had the French onion soup. The waitress rolled her eyes at us when my friend asked for utensils. I got completely blown off when I asked for some crackers to go with my soup. The waitress said they no longer carry crackers. When I asked about bread instead, she said nope. When I asked if they have any bread at all, she said well the buns for the burgers but you can't have that. So I then asked about the bread they put in the French onion soup, because clearly they have some type of bread in their kitchen but she was clearly not interested in letting me have any. Is there some type of bread shortage??  She was clearly not interested in serving us that day. I know customers can be annoying but we were not being rude or inappropriate.

24,James T.,"Fairfield, CA",57,12,,1.0,2018-01-05,"I've been to this location many of times, it literally is a hit or miss, mostly misses. Being understaffed is one thing, I get it. Wait times aren't usually the issue. The issue is mainly having rude hosts/waiters/waitresses. My last visit I came with friends, we asked for a booth for 5 people. For all sakes and purposes we were fine with the 20-30 minute wait, and asked for something that can fit all 5 of us. Mind you with the long wait, one of our friends went to go snag something quickly from a store. When we got called for us 5. They say ya down in the smallest booth section. When we say we asked for a chair so my friend can have a place as well. The host responded with ""no you can't"" And kind of proceeded to be like ""this is why we asked you for a booth or table. We asked you!"" Very rudely as if it's our fault you can't figure out where to put 5 people. We said booth but there are clearly booths big enough for 5 plus. Already kind of irritated she kind of suggested we can wait til the big party was done then we can be sat. The waitress (who was nice) came over and of course we just explained the situation and she was fine with it but just wanted to check with her manager, who he also said no and came to explain to us why it can't be there and offered to move us to another booth when it became available and at that point, the damage had been done. He tried to stop us by offering free appetizers and I'm kind of tired of this location more focused on trying to stop upset guests then just assuring the experience is good. It's happened quite a lot of times at this location over the years and it sucks to say this but If I go to Applebee's it'll be at the vacaville location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6?start=20,1.64,1.87,1.87,,1.7780000000000002

Every once and a while we go. I don't know why we don't eat at Applebee's more often. But John made us a believer. We were helped by John who was training another person. My husband and I got one of the 2 for $25 deals. The portions were more than enough. I got the chicken pasta dish with spinach and I think Alfredo sauce (thanks not the official name). My kids got the corn dog and Mac and cheese with chicken. I don't remember what my husband got. My kids and husband finished my off because the portions were more than enough. I really enjoyed there appetizer Caesar salad. The dressing was just enough for flavoring but not overpowering. John was real personable and took care of us. Since it was my sons birthday he got a very delicious birthday ice cream. It had crumbled Oreo cookies, a drizzle of chocolate syrup and whipped cream.  Needless to say, my husband and I finished it off for him. Thanks John for making my son's day special!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairfield-6,1.76,1.9,1.9,,1.8439999999999999
