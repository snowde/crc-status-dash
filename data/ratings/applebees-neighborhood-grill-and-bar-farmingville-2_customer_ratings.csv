6,David O.,"Farmingville, NY",27,25,3.0,3.0,2013-12-20,"Typical casual fast food restaurant. Appetizers are very good, entree's just ok. Tonite I had spinach dip as an app and a blue cheese burger. Spinach dip came out piping hot, and had some nice, chips were warm and salty. Very nice. The burger was fine, I like my beef medirm rare, Applebee's doesn't server it that way, it has to be fully cooked. It was still pretty juicy, the bacon and blue cheese mix well with the beef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

9,John S.,"Selden, NY",4,47,12.0,2.0,2014-05-05,"I'm writing this while the frustration is still fresh. I went to this Applebee's on a Monday. The bar had five other patrons,  but the unobservant bartender named John (a discredit to the name) was rarely around.  It took over ten minutes to order drinks, and even though we were handed menus, he never asked what we wanted to eat. In fact, if we didn't have the drinks we'd have gone across the street to Ruby Tuesdays, which has GOT to have better service. John never took our order; a barback asked if we needed food. After finishing my drink, the bartender asked if I wanted another. I replied yes, but didn't get a second drink until I asked him about it, even though he printed the receipt first. Talk about incompetent. I am never going to return to this Applebee's. The only reason they got two stars is because the food was exactly what you'd expect, otherwise I'd try to pick a negative amount due solely to the horrible bartender. I know not to expect the A game on Monday, but I figure a joint like Applebee's would at least have standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

3,YelpBoy Y.,"Long Island, NY",3,24,1.0,4.0,2015-08-10,"YelpBoy was very surprised by Applebee's! After making it a point to stay out of Applebee's for many years, due to the memory of their franchise simply being bottom of the barrel when compared to TGI Fridays, Houlihans etc etc, I made a return (due to the draft beers at Fridays across the street being rancid) and I was absolutely shocked at the changes that have taken place over the years. Sure, it still looks like your average Applebee's but now they offer a craft beer menu, with each beer being fresh, clean and crisp, and the food was much better than I remember--with a menu that seems much more interesting than before. I was very wary when I ordered it, but now I can say confidently, can you beat the Brisket Sliders for a measly $5? Nope. Behind the bar, met Sal and John on two different nights; both good guys that I recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,,,,,
5,Mary S.,"Coram, NY",0,4,,2.0,2015-10-11,"Your review helps others learn about great local I've gone  to this Applebees many times, but this Saturday was very disappointing. My husband and I along with another couple went this past Saturday. First the waiter had no personality and when my friends husband asked a question  he gave us a very odd look. (Sorry I don't remember his name) the salads came and half way through they brought the dinners.( guess they were giving us the bums rush!) the steaks were very tough and the vegetables that were supposed to be steamed were very under cooked also. when the manager came over to see how  we liked the food, we told him the steaks we're tough. He offered another steak but at that time, we couldn't wait, we had a show to catch. The bill came and to our surprise, the manager didn't give us any sort of discount or offer us dessert because of the complaint. We were very disappointed with the whole dinner experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,,,,,

2,Rich F.,"Farmingville, NY",0,2,,5.0,2016-03-03,Excellent food and service. Food selection is great and always cooked perfectly and served promptly.  The menu is probably the largest variety of any similar chain of restaurants.  We go there every week for lunch and have an enjoyable meal.  Waitresses and managers are always friendly and concerned that we receive good food and service.  Highly recommended.  Now has good wifi service too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,,,,,

We've been there often enough and would based on past result, would have given them 3 starts at most. Their quality is inconsistent. It can be great or it can be awful, depending. Last time around was awful.  The waitress knocked a drink into my wife's lap, and my burger was so f'ing greasy its still laying in me.  The time prior to that, the food was OK, but the drinks were so bad we had to send them back. They're not as horrendous as the Ruby Tuesday in Selden, but not far from it. Time to start putting up with the longer waits for a table at Fridays, I think....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2,,,,,
25,Steve L.,"Farmingville, NY",5,40,1.0,1.0,2016-05-17,"Just went here today, for starters, the service was atrocious! It  easily took us 15 minutes to get our drinks refilled, the food was sub par to say the least and to top it off for some reason the gift card I purchased from Raise would not go through their antiquated system, thus after being informed that it had gone through I deleted the card from my Raise account, only for her to come back and tell me it didn't go through. So now I am out $50. Over all this left a sour taste in my mouth.

0,Ashley S.,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",0,11,1.0,3.0,2016-07-16,3 stars because of the half off apps and the deserts are pretty good but the service is horrid. I went today and had a server named Lisa and she was absolutely the rudest person I've never met in my entire life. First she was extremely rude after taking our orders then she basically threw the glass plates at us that it almost hit someone I was with then she gave us our food WITHOUT any silverware lately she stood over us while we tipped her and counted us in front of us because of her I will never come to this Applebee's again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Heather W.,"Manhattan, NY",19,313,382.0,1.0,2016-08-10,"I have a million complaints about our experience here- but I'll just stick with a few:  They 'closed' before closing time; begrudgingly agreed to serve us food; brought us half there and half 'to go'.  What is the point if you're going to balk the entire time?!  I'd much rather go ANYWHERE else if you are going to make us feel badly about our asking for food, for you being a FOOD establishment.  Thanks for that.   I really have no idea whether the bartender thought she was doing us a favor, a horrible person, and/or just should have a non-people job.  The niceties after we were about to leave were perplexing, possibly because my   ridiculously too-kind companion left a  ridiculously huge tip. Why I still have no idea. We ended up trying to eat it in the parking lot. That being said, the food was inedibly salty. After driving 12 hrs w no food, I had two bites and just could NOT eat this.  I hope this review helps ANYONE, as I really hate 'complaining'- I just thought this needed to be said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2,,,,,

16,Kristen W.,"East Moriches, NY",30,63,8.0,3.0,2017-05-05,"Standard experience at this location. Ordered food online to be picked up curbside. I must note that the ease of the online ordering process was super! A couple clicks and 15 minutes later, boom, your food is there (use the $5 off coupon for your first online order!). Anyway, I ordered the lunch combo of the steak and bean soup and the Thai shrimp salad. Both were good; just good. The Thai shrimp salad came with two sauces that you are to put on together (not sure how this salad remains around 390 calories given the dressings and fixings), and some crunchies mixed in. The shrimp seemed a little soggy. The soup was fine. Good online ordering experience, okay food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

The crowds can get crazy and with a toddler waiting can be such a nightmare. However i was so pleasantly surprised today. My husband had called around 7 to see how busy they were and they actually took our name down after we told them we were 10mins away from there. When we got their the place was packed as usual but we waited about 5mins and the hostess brought us to our table. After sitting down about 5mins later the waitress came over to get our drinks and we placed our order since we already knew what we wanted and we figured it was gonna be a long wait. Again we were pleasantly surprised we got our appetizer and my son got his entree in less than 10mins! And then our food followed shortly. We had the spinach dip which was amazing! Not overly salty and tasted so good! I ordered the oriental salad. That dressing is so good!! Hubby got the all day brunch burger which he loved! Overall a great experience!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-farmingville-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

The last time I was here our waitress took forever to take our order and it wasn't busy at all. Granted, we had a larger table of 8, but she never came to get us refills, the food took over an hour to come out and she was rude when THEIR machines to pay weren't working.
