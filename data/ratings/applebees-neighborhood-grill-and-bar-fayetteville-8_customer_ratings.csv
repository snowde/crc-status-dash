20,Nick N.,"Seattle, WA",1,39,47.0,1.0,2013-05-10,"Applebee's has the advantage of being cheap, fast, and friendly. They have so much potential, because let's face it, people don't go to Applebee's expecting fine cuisine. They want to have a nice lunch or dinner with their family, then head home. This entire process is messed up when you get slow, lazy, and rude service. Skibo Applebee's 1/10.

25,Molly M.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,7,,3.0,2014-01-27,A typical Applebee's. A busy/family area. First time I went on Christmas Eve and the service was horrible. They complained about having to work that night but who couldn't blame them? The bartender was on her phone the whole time and all the waitresses gathered around to chat and took us awhile to get her attention for the check so we could leave. The food was very good though. I order the Tequila Chicken Tango (I believe that's what is was called) and I loved it! The chicken was cooked very well topped with a delicious creamy glaze sauce  and a good portion of shrimp with a side of rice. My Husband ordered the 6oz sirloin which is his top choice. We both loved the food but hated the service so the second time we did the to-go service which was very quick and nice and able to enjoy the food in the comfort of our home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8?start=20,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002

Service is mediocre ( I wasn't expecting 5 star service it is Applebee's) but when the waitress can't get your soft drink order right there is a problem.

24,Adriana G.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,4,5.0,2.0,2014-09-03,"We were celebrating my Husbands birthday. Our server Ashley was very delightful! Food was okay, garlic bread was gross & steak wasn't all that great! The other issues I had was the music was really low, ambiance didn't feel welcoming, dead silence & I felt crowded at my own table ... We had a party of 10 and the booth they placed us in was too small.. They told us the bigger section was closed due to insufficient staff, however about 30mins later a party of about 8 were seated there. We spoke to a manager and she was very respectful and apologetic. However, I will not be returning to Applebee's on skibo rd. I will try something better next outing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8?start=20,,,,,

I ordered the chicken penne and it was alright but the breadstick that came with it was basically like biting into a warm oily sponge. My husband's steak and potatoes were good, but they over cooked his steak. The green bean crispers we ordered were absolutely horrible! They tasted old and soggy and then it seemed like they tried to deep fry them longer to make them crispy so they got burnt. My husband ordered BBQ wings for his appetizer and they came out with 4 wings for $11.99, which we thought was extremely over priced, but they were absolutely delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8,,,,,

16,Christina P.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,9,15.0,2.0,2015-10-31,"So we walk in and it seemed to be a hassle for the hostess to seat us even though it really wasn't busy. Then when our server comes to our table it was obvious he had no desire to be there. I understand, it was 9:00. But, I asked when the half price appatizers started and he had no clue. He went to ask, came back with my drink, not my fiancé's and still didn't know...after 5 minutes he came back and took our orders. I got a salad and a burger with with sweet potato fries, my fiancé ordered steak medium rare. The salad was great, but he gave me a burger with nothing on it, even though it's supposed to come with lettuce, onion and pickles. And my fries were cold. My fiancé's stake was completely rare. So I waited another 10 mins for the toppings for my burger and fresh fries. Once everything was fixed, it was good, but definitely not work $50!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8,,,,,
26,Cyrus G.,"Fort Bragg, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-16,The worst service I have ever had at a restaurant and it was the kitchens fault! My family and I came in and got seated quickly. After we met our waiter he quickly got our drinks and orders then it went down hill. It took 20 minutes to get our cheese sticks and salads as we got our appetizers and salad our food came out at the same time. When my father and wife started eating their main meal it was like warm and we ask for more mashed potatoes as they were cold. The rest of the plates came out about 5 minutes later except my steak. They over cooked it and took another 15-20 minutes to get my food and still haven't received out potatoes. We never received refills on drinks when we asked multiple times. We spoke with the manager ken to get us refill and still we had to wait more time than it should of. They are not busy it was 930 pm.

11,Mike W.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,3,,1.0,2017-03-20,"My wife and went there for lunch. She ordered the nachos and I ordered the BBQ tacos. We were greeted by Logan,ordered are drinks and proceeded to wait. We waited almost 40 minutes for our food and when I counted the number of other patrons (17) I knew then something was wrong.  When we received our food it was cold and burnt (nachos). While the bill may have only come out to $25 or so, had we paid, this post might seem trivial but a point has to made. The manager heard our complaints and offered nothing except an insincere apology. My wife and I frequent this location a couple of times a month since they offer a gluten-free option but this will happen no more. Applebee's on Skibo you have lost over 600.00 in annual sales from my family due to poor food preparation an d an obvious health code violation on serving cold food. On a positive note, Logan our server was very professional and did a great job.  He was the lone bright spot during the visit.

My wife and I sat at the bar... bartender was super sweet & trying her damnedest to get food and drinks pumped out. They were not busy but seems like the kitchen couldn't keep up or the staff! People were coming in and literally standing at the door for 4-5 mins or more. Phone was ringing off the hook, they weren't answering any calls. Ticket times were ridiculous!!! We waited over 30 mins for food to come out at the BAR area. When our food did finally come out , my chicken had felt/looked/tasted like it was stale and had just been sitting under the heater in the back. Green beans were cold. Matter fact had them take the entire plate back after trying to nibble on it! Trash!!! I do not recommend this location.

6,Denise B.,"Douglas Byrd, Fayetteville, NC",13,4,,1.0,2017-07-06,"Went here July 1st 2017, with my husband and my grandson. We had a long day of taking up the kitchen floor to replace it, that we wanted a quick, decent priced, hot, good meal.  That was a big NO! We were seated fairly quickly and our server showed up to our table as soon as we sat down to take our drink order. In just a few minutes she returned with the drinks and took our meal order. That's where the good service literally STOPPED.  After 20 minutes, she walked by and seen we did not have our food, to which she replied, let me see what's holding the kitchen up.  10 minutes later a guy from the kitchen was bringing our food out. My grandson order chicken strips and fries. Which were warm, on the cooler side of warm I should say. I ordered their new chicken with picco, and shrimp plate. Chicken was over cooked and dry and cold. Shrimp was over cooked and dry. Mashed potatoes were old and had formed a hard crust on the surface and were cold. My husband got the 5 riblets, and yes it was cold too! We did not see our waitress again, until we managed to finish eating. Even though our meal was cold, we were hungry, so we ate. Had these meals not been over cooked and were hot when delivered, I believe they would have been good. Our waitress shows up and ask us if we were finished and would like dessert.  We said no thank you. She also finally noticed me and my husband were out of drink, and asked if we needed a refill. And again we said no. We wanted the check. Off she went again. Now I normally tip well above the expected percent. I first hand know how important tipping is. But I left less than expected tip this time. I will not tip anyone who lacks in their job and expects a tip. No they were not busy at the time we were there. And we never seen our waitress any where on the floor with any other tables. Yes, we looked for her. We had been out of drinks less than half way threw our meal, due to how dry and over cooked it was. Which I'm sure happened as it sat in the kitchen waiting for her to deliver it to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

1,Kristin D.,"Fayetteville, NC",3,39,4.0,1.0,2017-07-30,"The food is good but this location sucks. I highly recommend the one one Raeford Rd. What makes this place terrible is not just how often they mess with the food but the service itself. Every experience I've had was just unsatisfactory up until my last visit. I came in during normal rush hour late around 7pm. The waitresse first impression when  I walked in was clear. She was annoyed at yet another customer walking in and was very  displeased about having to do her job obviously not wanting to be there. She sat me to the closes table next to the entrance and informed me my server would be with me any moment.  It waited over 10 minutes to have my order taken. I almost walked thinking this would be like my last experience and I should have just drove the extra mile for the other location. When I was finally served I decided to just put up with it having a little faith it would get better. I ordered the salmon entree which comes with two sides. I only asked that one of my sides, the mashed potatoes, just add sourcream to it. It took over 30 minutes for my order to be served and another table went through the same phase where they waited just as long as me. When the waitress brought my food she just slid it on the table and left. I noticed right away the portions were smaller than usual and the presentation was sloppy. Also the side of mash they made it a messy loaded mash with cheese all over. I was not happy and scrapped the idea for dessert to get out of this place sooner. Again I waited over 20 minutes for a check and the tablet  that's always real convenient was not working. Waitress appears and I ask for the check, she comes back and closes the other table that came after I did before running around and then another 10 minutes passed finally gives me the check. Some more waiting and I'm finally out of there. After the long wait and dissatisfaction with the service & food I vowed to never come back to this location. The other location is usually quiet and not packed most of the time. Plus the servers over there are nice and show they actually care rather than give you a salty attitude about what you may need or if something is wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-8,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
