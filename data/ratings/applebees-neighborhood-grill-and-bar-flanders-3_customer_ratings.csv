0,Patricia C.,"Port Washington, NY",1,29,,4.0,2012-03-19,"Stopped at this restaurant on a trip home from the Pocono's to Long Island.  Needed a place to eat that was going to be not an adventure.  Also wanted fast off the highway and quick on.  This Applebee's was perfect.  The menu was extensive, the food was good and the prices were very good.  We had the 2 for $20 deal and actually took food home.  The staff were attentive and quick to serve.  My steak was not quite to my cooked liking and they took it back and fixed it to be perfect, no problem. My only one complaint would be the ladies room was a bit disgusting.  But to be honest you cannot really fault the restaurant for the slobs that use the rest rooms.  But they need to pay better attention to cleaning them more often. All in all on my trips using route 80 I will definitely eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3?start=20,,,,,
25,Daniel L.,"Budd Lake, NJ",0,11,8.0,3.0,2012-09-26,"We eat at this Applebee's location frequently.  I have had a pretty good experience and find they are very accommodating to parties with small children (we have 2 year old twins)  The servers generally ask if we would like the children's meals with the appetizers or with the meals.  In addition to the server, we usually find that a manager is also checking if things are good with each tables.  Many times we also use the car side to go service and find the meals ready on time and well packed.  We have not experienced the poor service others have noted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
20,Dick G.,"Syosset, NY",755,442,2875.0,3.0,2013-12-01,They discontinued the All you can eat Soup and Salad at lunch. Very disappointing...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,

22,Jess D.,"Randolph, NJ",73,75,39.0,5.0,2014-10-22,Favorite Applebee's location. Great staff!

17,Rasp J.,"Stanhope, NJ",2,27,45.0,3.0,2015-06-13,"My Wife & I just had dinner there. I had the Triple Hog Dare Ya.  It wasn't all that. Not much pulled pork,slice of bland ham, the bacon was ok. The bbq. sauce over powered it. The waiter never offered more French fries to which there wasn't a lot either. It  was supposed to be free refill of fries.  My Wife had the Citrus Chicken with rice which she thoroughly enjoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
11,Amy H.,"Flanders, NJ",66,198,95.0,4.0,2015-06-15,"Applebee's - this is the place my kids always beg to go to.  Why? they absolutely love their kids meal selections.  You can get Mac and Cheese, big kid mac and cheese with breadcrumbs and chicken!  French Bread Pizza, chicken tenders, Chicken grillers etc.  The part they love is the yogurt with apples and the apple sauce go go squeezes.  Great great sides for kids.  It also keeps them away from the french fries - when we are here they don't even ask for them! For the adults, they have an ever changing menu. We tried the new shrimp appetizer - it was very good.  Lightly tempura battered with a light spicy sauce.  Very good.   My husband had his 'ol faithful' - Chicken Fajita Rollup and i had what was the old Tequila Lime Chicken - but aye they are family friendly so now we call it the Fajita Chicken :)  Yummy to say the least.   Service was good - she wasn't the most talkative server and didn't make any recommendations. She was on top of the refills of drinks and did let my children order which sometimes servers do not like.  Overall, i would recommend this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
14,Shawn S.,"Manhattan, NY",32,57,290.0,3.0,2015-06-24,"Cool franchise restaurant and bar, 2 for $20 deal is great, selection of food is good.  Been here after 10 for 1/2 price apps also.  Good family place, not so much for singles who want to meet up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,

23,JA W.,"Flanders, NJ",0,18,,3.0,2015-12-16,Came with a group of 6 and didn't have a wait around 5:30 on a Saturday. Typical Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
9,Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1730,1527,245.0,2.0,2016-02-26,"I cannot believe I actually went this Applebee's. We were in the area, we were meeting people and it turns out everywhere we decided on, there was a minimum of 30-45 min wait...bummer. So we were left with this place. 20 minute wait.  The food here is gross. Now, I do like my chains every once in a while but this place is terrible.  Let me back up. The only edible food was the app - pretzels and beer cheese dip.  I had a chicken wrap thing that I took two bites and just ate the fries...oh and they were decent. The chicken was fake...I mean like Panera bad... Their margarita's are so sweet (not in a good way)...and so many ice cubes...blah!  Why 2 stars? The pretzels and service.  I wouldn't go back... Avoid if you can...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
16,Brian D.,"Laramie, WY",16,16,1.0,1.0,2016-04-09,Had a bartender Tim that was rude. I couldn't believe the service. We were enjoying our night. Spent $170 dollars we were just kicking back and got kicked out for no reason. What an asshole!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
15,Mark R.,"Flanders, NJ",0,1,,5.0,2016-06-07,Love this applebees I guess you would have to call me a regular there since I go once a week I know the bartender manager and most of the servers by name. The environment is amazing the staff makes it fun and where else can you drink and eat for 2 people for around 36-40 and have such a great time. If ever in the area I recommend stopping in especially if tim is on bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,
10,Anil D.,"Pittstown, NJ",1,9,2.0,5.0,2016-07-31,"We just had diner at Applebee's in Mount Olive, NJ. We had the best experience there being vegetarian.

12,Jeff R.,"Selden, NY",0,17,,4.0,2017-03-07,Sat at the bar. Bartender Tim is great. He's a master at his craft.  Craft beer selection is small but very good selections. Food is normal Applebee food. Not bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,,,,,

7,Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709.0,3.0,2017-10-29,"We were a group of eight on Saturday evening. The wait was very long (well over half an hour) but I think the problem was they only had one table set up for a group of eight, so another group had to finish their meal first before we could get it. When we did get that table, the other problem we noticed is the table had an enormous centerpiece, with condiments and cards, that we could not remove. It was like a wall dividing us into two groups of four. Service was reasonably efficient and accommodating. Our server readily agreed to split the bill, which was great since our orders were all very different. I had the crispy brewhouse chicken. The flavor was great. The texture was indeed crispy despite liberal application of sauce. However, the portion size seemed on the small side for what the entree cost. For dessert, I had a brownie bite. Perhaps the brightest spot of the meal, it was a nice small dessert at a reasonable price. Overall, I'm reminded why I rarely go to Applebee's. It's both good and bad, but never outstanding. It's a straight down the middle sit-down restaurant chain experience that I'm usually not inclined to pay an above average price for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
