17,Melissa R.,"Florissant, MO",0,12,,3.0,2012-06-30,I have been picking  to go for a couple weeks now. I have also been getting items on Weight Watchers and 550 calories menu.  Each meal and salad has been excellent! I have to update my review. My to go order this week was disappointing. I have ordered this dish before and it's supposed to b spicy. The first time the dish was full of flavor. This one the container was not full and it was very bland. I won't order the Asian shrimp dish again :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
0,Kevin H.,"Nashville, TN",1,24,,3.0,2012-07-24,"Definitely a middle of the road. The service was what was to be expected, as was the food. Nothing to see here... keep moving.,, unless you want consistent food/service. It was convenient to where I was working. I can't say it was good or bad. I'd describe it as a double yellow. Definitely what I would expect, but I'd like to have some fun/pass people (middle of the road reference if you didn't catch that).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
16,E J.,"Maryville, IL",0,2,,1.0,2015-02-19,I called at 4:30 PM and place to carry out order for 5:15 PM. I arrive at 5:15 PM and I am told that my food be right out. 30 minutes later I asked to speak with the manager and all he has to say is yeah the bartender is busy. I say it has nothing to do with bartender and he replies yeah the kitchen is busy too. He shrugs and says sorry. Waiting 30 minutes for my food completely defeated the purpose of ordering carry out.  I Will never get carry out from this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
15,Melissa R.,"Saint Louis, MO",4,16,,1.0,2015-06-13,Terrible service even when nobody is dining in. They run a scam with credit cards also. Watch your cards if you eat here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
7,Baby C.,"Chicago, IL",124,98,1031.0,1.0,2015-06-24,"My sister and I went for drinks only  but it was very weird how they were foamy I first had a Blue Moon which was fine then we got Long Islands. The 1st Long Island had a piece of hair so the bartender changed hers out but pic enclosed of our foamy drinks. She didn't even finish her 2nd one because the foam was just not going away, even took pic of ice with let over foam!  I've had plenty of Long Islands and never one like this",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
10,Eric G.,"Florissant, MO",310,2,,1.0,2015-07-14,"The MOST horrible experience of a restaurant I have ever had. We arrived about 10 pm on a Friday night (plenty of time to get some food right?). We walked in had a 15 minute wait which wasn't too bad. Plenty of tables were open, but maybe no one wanted to serve a party of 8 that late. Finally we were sat food and beverages were ordered and as the food came out that's when all the chaos started. As the food came out we told the server that some things were wrong. It really wasn't the server's (Eugene) fault, but you could see the frustration in his face that the kitchen messed up. I am not sure who exported the food but that's where it should have been checked before bringing it to the table. We sent several things back, but when I received my food (buffalo wings), I noticed that it was served in a to go container...just the wings... I asked for sauce on the side which I did not get. But the food was just thrown in the bowl like I was a dog. No tissue paper or celery. I asked for the manager when the bill came and asked do I have to pay for this and his reply was, ""It was served to you right?"" He is still standing after that comment. But, after awhile we hear a lot of shouting from the kitchen. It was our server and the cooks who got into it. They were arguing and shouting loud at the top of their voices. The manger runs to the back and shouts, ""SHUT UP, SHUT UP, I SAID SHUT UP!""  Just soooooo unprofessional the whole experience. I will NEVER be back to this restaurant again and I have told their corporate office the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
4,Jacqui P.,"Saint Louis, MO",126,136,693.0,3.0,2015-08-19,I stop by this applebees about once a month when I'm in the area.  I usually sit either at the bar or in the bar area when I'm here.  The bartenders are friendly and offer good service.  I'm usually just grabbing a few drinks when at applebees...food is ok for me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
13,Heather W.,"Hazelwood, MO",2,2,1.0,1.0,2015-10-20,I usually a sucker for buffalo wings here and they were good but my burger was so plain nothing like describe that's fine but what I got mad about all our fries were cold like the reserved us someone's else fries if I'm pay I'd like fresh fries but server was nice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
3,Jennifer C.,"Saint Louis, MO",112,421,793.0,3.0,2016-02-15,"I'm a sucker for Applebee's Blondie Dessert!  Oh man, the way the skillet sizzles when you pour the maple sauce over the cake and ice cream...oooooo!  This dessert is the perfect decadence to end a stressful day.  Waiter on this day was Micah, he did a great job. Very attentive and friendly.  Ask for him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
14,Jessie S.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,5,,5.0,2016-05-12,"What great staff! Came here straight from the airport, visiting from California and starving for a good meal. Everyone from Robert, who greeted us at the door, to the manager and to our server Angie were absolutely wonderful. They were all so attentive and concerned that we had the best service possible. Such a great experience after a long early morning flight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
9,Gerald M.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,8,1.0,1.0,2016-07-07,"Upon returning from a visit I called ahead of time to order from the Carside menu, basically because my driver was in a hurry to drop me off and run errands for his wife. When I ordered, the site informed me that it would be 15 minutes to complete my order. It took us 11 min. to get there and after waiting 10 more minutes he went in, as I am disabled, to pick up my food that I ordered thru the App. They told him it would be 5 to 10 min. more. Now agitated, that time came and went, but he had to go back in their to see them bagging the food. That was the good part. When I got home the half slab looked like 1/4 and dry and the chicken tortilla soup was lacking any semblance of liquid. It looked like a casserole and was spicy hot (a quality they neglected to mention on the menu). You probably have surmised that I was totally unhappy and unimpressed. The only reason I didn't take it back was they either didn't give him a receipt or it came out of the bag. My last comment concerns the fact that they said it would be 15 minutes before my order was ready, but they didn't have it ready until 30 minutes after I arrived, making me think they didn't start until after we parked in the spot. My friend was mad at me and I am upset with Applebee's. Take one guess if I'll be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
12,Tyler K.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,61,1.0,5.0,2016-08-08,"I stopped by here while passing through town. The food was refreshing and my server was really nice! The place also uses this free phone app called 'GiftAMeal,' which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pick of my burger through the app. i thought that was a nice touch. Overall great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
6,Tamandra T.,"Saint Louis, MO",33,104,47.0,1.0,2016-10-20,Okay so my food was very good but getting it was a whole other story!  I work 45 mins away and have a 15 month old so i ordered food when i was about 15 mins out and the app said it would be ready. Those of us with babies know its just easier to stay i  the car  When i pulled up there was already a car there. I ordered so I could hurry up and grab food without having to wait too long bc my baby gets fussy after a while if the car isnt moving. So i waited an extra 7 mins on top of the 15 mins and no one came out so I called the store. The girl said my food was ready and i could come in and get it. I said I ordered curbside to go so arent you supposed to bring it out? She said we dont come outside after dark...mind you it was 645 pm and it was darn near dark when i put the order in. She told me she would go ahead and bring it out so i waited like an extra two mins then i just undid my baby to head in. I told the handicap woman parked next to me on my way in that they werent coming out. She had been waiting even longer than me. So i went in And This chick was still at the register like she hadnt even planned on bringing my food out to me. She had just told the manager to get my food as he was getting the handicap womans. Of course we were both disappointed. She walked out telling them that she was never coming back but I asked to speak to a manager. He just gave me excuses as to why they dont go outside and i said thats fine if you dont but you need to update your website or the signs outside in the parking spaces if youre not going to offer curbside to go instead of having people wasting their time waiting. You can at keast give a courtesy call or some message with the confirmation stating this. I am beyond pissed.  Im not going to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
11,Elisa F.,"Rantoul, IL",0,4,,5.0,2016-10-28,"Our server was delightful.  Food was good! Manager, Dave is exemplary - he takes care of his customers with humor and charm. We saw him attending to a fussy little one,  offering to take them for a walk around the restaurant - singing happy birthday to another little one and stopping to check-in with his guests. Supernice place. Yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
8,Sam L.,"Florissant, MO",78,5,,1.0,2017-01-04,"I started working down the road from this Applebee's and decided to get lunch one day. Well it was the worst mistake and ended up getting sick. A couple months passed and I figured I 'd give it a go again, I'm always willing to try again. Well I got sick AGAIN! Multiple coworkers got sick as well. I'm not sure if they just aren't sanitary or they don't cook the food well enough. I will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,

5,April L.,"Florissant, MO",14,4,,1.0,2017-08-01,"Took too long to get food--waited 50 minutes, and our server (who was very nice) did not check with us and it was not even a busy night. Won't ve back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
2,Robert B.,"Southwest Garden, Saint Louis, MO",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-21,"This place is close to me. They should have no issues getting my business. But you have to expect them to screw up at least one thing royally. Management must be used to it. Because they don't move an inch. They're friendly, but I doubt they can afford to fix the screwups. If you're up to it, drive 20 minutes in a different direction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florissant-6,,,,,
