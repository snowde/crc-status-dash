138,L H.,"Mineola, NY",4,28,10.0,2.0,2012-01-16,"Pros: -Your typical applebees menu, with Flushing-friendly decor. -abundance of servers -they play all types of sports games and the bar is a great place to watch.  -good happy hour while the games are on! Cons:  -Not your typical service, rather lack there of. There are too many servers (for such an empty house) but I can never seem to get decent service i.e. getting water or drinks on time, food takes too long and arrives lukewarm, all while the servers are hanging out in the corner laughing at their own jokes, etc, etc. I've only come here to watch games when I've been too lazy to go out to the city, or when I was craving for some fatty American food in Flushing.  However, I always leave this place with a bitter taste in my mouth. Service is just downright subpar and unprofessional -- even for a chain restaurant. The only thing I recommend is the bar for happy hour during game nights.

105,Jane S.,"Plainville, CT",0,4,,1.0,2012-05-29,"I had dinner here last summer, and my dissatisfaction is still fresh enough to warrant a review. My boyfriend and I came here at dinner time, and it was practically empty. Normally, when I go to an Applebees at dinnertime, I'd be waiting around for a few minutes because the tables are full. However, at this place, my boyfriend and I were waiting for one of the no-brain waiters/waitresses to stop chitchatting with each other long enough to seat us. When we were finally seated, it took a good 15 minutes for someone to even bring us a menu. Perhaps because the place was so empty that the workers didn't even realize they had customers? Still, unbelievable. I mean, I had to flag someone down to get a stinkin' menu. Some tall, lanky, geeky-looking guy was our waiter. He disappeared after giving us the menu. I swear, we waited a good 15+ minutes and this guy was nowhere to be found. I had to flag down some other guy who happened to walk by. He turned out to be a manager or something rather. He was nice enough; he apologized for the poor service, personally took our orders, and called over the lump that was our waiter and scolded him a bit. That was probably the only good part of this dinner. I had ordered a sandwich, and it took, no joke, nearly an HOUR for it to come out. When we had managed to get a hold of the waiter, he make some bullshit explanation that we had to give my order extra time to make. That made absolutely no sense whatsoever, because my boyfriend had ordered a burger, which actually considers cooking, and he got it before my order, which requires absolutely no cooking whatsoever. The waiter never bothered to stop by our table to see if we needed more water or anything. Nope, he completely disappeared until we needed our check. Then of course, he took his sweet time with my boyfriend's credit card. You can believe that we left him zero tip. My boyfriend, however, did leave him a nice little love note on the receipt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2?start=120,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000004

We were just sitting there with the hostesses right in front of us with rows of empty tables everywhere. Just when I was about to complain and asked my boyfriend if we could leave I guess the hostess got the message and gave us a table that was clear the whole entire time.

Luckily she didn't break a tooth or it cut her throat when going down.  We then called the waiter told her the situation and she was like okay. We then asked to speak to the manager. The manager was like ""oh okay"" when we mentioned it to him. He wasn't very accommodating to the situation. He offered us a lunch combo deal to come back for lunch on a weekday.

If she didn't lie to me in the beginning I would've ordered something else, maybe something she actually knew how to make. I found out that it was made with a mix from a friend who works at Applebee's. I was very disappointed that she lied to my face. The most she talked to me was when I asked for the bill and then she wouldn't leave me alone I work in the industry so I tipped over 20% regardless but I just know I'll never go there and order an alcoholic beverage or sit at the bar again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2?start=60,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.832,2.68

65,Ricardo S.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,15,12.0,1.0,2015-09-09,"On August 31st, 2015,my fiancee and I decided to stop by this Applebee's within the Skyview mall. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before we took a walk by Citi Field. The restaurant was only 40% full so we figured the wait for food wouldn't be long. When the hostess arrived from seating a previous patron, she promptly points us towards a seat by the entrance. We told her that we instead wanted a seat towards the back of restaurant and seats by the door can be a little drafty. She replied ""Are you sure? The service back there isn't good."" To this, my fiancee and I did a double take. However, instead of heeding her warning, we chalked it up to inter-restaurant dynamics. Maybe her and the server  did not like each other. After being seated, we waited about 5 minutes for the waiter to come over and ask us for drinks.We both asked for water. 10 minuted later we get our drinks and order 2 hamburgers and a quesadilla appetizer. As my fiancee is about to drink her water, she notices a black dot on its surface. 10 minutes later, the waiter returns and we ask him to replace the water. He removes the water and places it on the table opposite of us. 8 minutes later, he returns with a new water. 11 minutes later, clearly noticing our agitation, he returns to the table to inform us that our meal should be arriving shorty. 10 minutes after that, and 54 minutes after being seated i ask one of the busboys to call over the manager.  The manager arrives and ask what can he help us with. I tell him that we have been sitting there for almost an hour and have not received a single part of our meal. He asks what ordered. I tell him the quesadilla and the two burgers.""I haven't seen that order in the back"". That was the last straw. I got up and said we're leaving.  After the whole ordeal, we chalked up this experience to a horrible waiter. While we sat, multiple waiters passed us by tending to patrons in other sections. it seemed as if our waiter was the only one off his game. This had been the second time he had served us and both times had been bad.

I ordered the chicken and shrimp with the mashed potatoes and he got the 9oz steak with sweet potato fries and veggies, there is a $1 surcharge for the sweet potato fries. My son got the kids meal mini burgers, which should be called extra mini burgers, that are even to small for a little boy. Barely any burger to the tiny bun, this came with your choice of side. He got the french fries and the mozzarella sticks. For some reason the fries here always taste like they have been fried with fish or seafood. I am not sure if it is because they might fry it in the same oil. The food was very salty and oily especially my chicken breast.  I am allergic to shrimp but asked for this on the side for my husband to eat since I could not substitute the shrimp for something else and there were limited chicken options on the 2 for 26 menu. Our waiter tried to be nice, but he was just too slow.... It took him about 15 minutes to get us silverware after our appetizers (caesar salads) came. Our salads literally came with like 2 croutons.  We asked for a few more since this is the essence of a caesar salad and it took him like 20 minutes to come back with them this was after our entrees were already half eaten and salad almost done.  He kept messing up our orders to.

I will never return to this location and as a result of the service (or lack of), I have not returned to any Applebee's franchise since 2011. I came here late September 2011 to celebrate my girlfriend's (now my wife) birthday with a group of friends and coworkers.  We were a group of 15 people and made reservations two weeks in advance. Upon entering Applebee's, the table was all set up and everything was well.  The restaurant was almost empty; there were only two other tables occupied.  We were expecting service to be fast, however, it was slow and very unprofessional.  Thanks to a waitress by the name of Kimberly. Before the groups arrival, a friend prepared the birthday cake and told the waitress that the cake was a surprise.  My wife being a Pokémon fan, we ordered her a pikachu cake.  Upon ordering, what struck me was that Kimberly said there was no tap water available!  Okay, fine!  Let's assume the fountain water wasn't working.  However, 3 minutes later, the table next to us, serviced by a different waiter, was brought out some fountain/tap water?  Unbelievable!  Kimberly wanted the whole table to order drinks so by default she could get a bigger tip.  She could have told us that water was available or that the machine was fixed, but she did not. As for the pickachu cake, it happened to be somebody else's birthday at the restaurant as well.  Guess what? Kimberly and her coworkers brought the pickachu cake to the wrong table! The other table pointed out the error, and the staff blew the candles out and brought it to the back.  Upon bringing the cake to our table, different candles were in the cake and there were holes all over the pikachu cake like it got shot up by a shotgun.   Service by this restaurant was very unprofessional throughout.  If you want a horrible time, and a way to ruin a special occasion, this would be the ideal place to go.   I highly recommend that you don't come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,2.64,2.33,2.33,1.5080000000000002,2.454

4,Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,689.0,4.0,2017-08-19,"We tried this location before and it was pretty good, so when we needed a quick meal (movie time was near).  We sat at the bar and it was interesting. It smelled a little sour, from all the overflow from the taps and drinks.  Happy hour brings odd sorts in to harass bartenders after they load up on liquid courage.  Even though these guys pestered the bartenders, they were so polite and bubbly to every customer that came to the bar.  Lysette got our order in and it took a while, but it came out fresh and hot.  We were going to save some for later but it was too good to leave back. It took a while to settle the bill (closing time was prolly near), but it will not keep us from coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.88,2.32,2.32,,2.144
15,Mandy Z.,"Queens, Queens, NY",7,4,3.0,3.0,2017-08-28,"I ordered the wonton tacos like always and it tasted just as good as other places however, the service was pretty slow. I went there with a friend and we only ordered 2 things but, it took them about 30-40 minutes to give us our food. Half the restaurant was closed off and it wasn't even that busy. The waitress there also doubled as the bartender so I understand why it took her a while to give us our order. If service was faster, it would've been a more enjoyable experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.96,2.31,2.31,,2.1700000000000004
22,Meng M.,"Millburn, NJ",3,3,1.0,1.0,2017-09-01,"45 minutes. That's how long it took for me to walk in the door until I got my food. My very mediocre food, not just once, but three times. The service is absolutely disgraceful. Unless you got no choice to eat, which is ridiculous because you're in flushing, do not eat here.

14,Linnie B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",28,3,,1.0,2017-09-15,"Took 15 min for waitress to come to our table.  Ordered kiddie milkshake for my 20 mnth old and she brought a huge ass glass.. said the kitchen made a mistake.  My son couldnt even hold the glass. What a joke!  Asked for a smaller glass and never received it. After the starter, someone took all the plates and clean utensils and napkins from the table. Told the manager i needed utensils when he brought my food.  10 min later I was still waiting.  At this point im so pissed off and my food all cold.  Waitress disappeared after taking my order. Food tasted nasty, steamed broccoli was all mushy. Never going back there again. Not even for free food.  Stay away and save yourself the frustration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.96,2.28,2.28,,2.152
12,Christianna N.,"Denver, CO",42,4,,1.0,2017-09-16,"Here on vacation and this put a damper on my night. First of all, when we got seated I had to ask someone to take our order that's how long we waited. When the food arrived I was then told they didn't have stir fry. I don't understand why they couldn't tell me before they started cooking my girlfriends food that way whatever I re ordered would've all came out together but no, they bring hers then decide to tell me. Didn't even order again, wasn't worth that wait. Horrible service. Never had to wait so long for a refill or the check. A 20 minute dinner turned into an hour of waiting minus my meal. 0 stars I'd give if possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.8,2.28,2.28,,2.088

After we placed our orders the waitress disappeared... for more than 15 minutes. Okay fine, food takes a while to make so I'll let it slide. Then our food came and my friend's well done burger was not well done at all. Because Of that, my friend started getting very nauseous. When it came to closing our tabs, they got our orders wrong and nearly charged me the wrong price twice!

0,Rich Y.,"WHITESTONE, NY",0,4,,5.0,2017-10-16,"Pleasant experience and great value. I go to this Applebee's on average once a month and usually order something in their 2 for $20 menu. It is the best value in downtown Flushing. For $20, you get one appetizer and 2 entrees plus FREE PARKING. Just parking alone is worth $3, so you're really paying 2 for $17. And they change the selection every now and then. My favorite entree is the Tilapia with marsh potatoes and garlic green bean, hope they will keep this item on the 2 for $20 in the future. And my favoirte appetizer is the spinach and artichoke dip. The seating is comfortable, ambiance is nice. Service can be hit or miss, but generally the servers are attentive and the food come quickly.  I think the business is decent there, but could be better if they can simply offer menu in Chinese, and put up a sign in their entrance saying ""Menu in Chinese available"", I can see many non-English speaking residents in Flushing won't go there just because they don't know what and how to order. Until then, it's a hidden gem in downtown Flushing to the Chinese residents there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.96,2.26,2.26,,2.1399999999999997

I asked the margarita and it was all bad and I complaint about it and the server said I have to pay extra if I want another one. Simply I said no and handed over the drink to her.

1,Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,81,278.0,1.0,2018-01-10,"Applebee's in Flushing Queens is the absolute worse Applebee's I've been to thus far. I am a MAJOR foodie and I know when food has been refried or just plain old no good.  I was trying to take my babies to Mamajuana's in the area, but they opened at 4pm and my kid were starved. We waited 8 mins by the entrance door for the waiter to place me at a table, but it was so busy with it being about 10 WHOLE customers in the Applebee's. When we were finally seated the kids were absolutely silent due to hunger.  I immediately asked the waitress to please bring the Chicken Taco's and Mozzarella Sticks. They tore through that as soon as she put it on the table. Before we could finish the appetizer the lunch came out 8 mins after the appetizers. I started on my salad and was not pleased. I order the same thing all the time. How do you mess up chicken fingers cut up in a salad. My son's fries were stale but my daughters wasn't. 2 of the 4 chicken fingers on where stale. SMH!!! You get the idea! STALE, RUSHED AND ANNOYED! Advice: Go if you are a BIG fan of stale rushed, refried food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flushing-2,1.76,2.18,2.18,,2.012
