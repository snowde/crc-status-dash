The Caesar salad is my fav, and you can't beat the 2 for $20 deals, the steak is delish. The sandwiches are also good and I hear they have new menu items coming out, can't wait. It's a chain, so know that going in.

3,Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282.0,2.0,2012-05-20,"You go to Applebee's for three reasons... A) You got a gift card from someone (reason I went tonight) B) Friends you want to meet up with are already there and you've lost out on your chance to talk them into going somewhere else. C) You really don't care.   Truth is, when I have come here, I have been OK with this place.  I've generally had decent service.  Some of the food is ok.  I have found that with chain restaurants, especially the Applebee's chain, that you tend to get better eating experiences with the appetizers and desserts, and not so much with the entrees.   So, your solution is to order up a couple of appetizers and a beer, and you probably won't complain as much.  But if you order up a steak or a plate of pasta you might regret it.  And I am certain that this goes for every other Applebee's restaurant out there.   For instance, tonight I went (with a gift card), and ordered up the boneless wings which were decent.  The blackened chicken penne pasta dish however was mildly mediocre.  It wasn't really flavorful enough to be strongly mediocre.  The wife liked her Bourbon shrimp and chicken.   Didn't bother with dessert.  After all, we only had a $25 gift card and I decided not to give them any actual money tonight.  But with the 2 for $20 deal, it worked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

You should see the look on my face when I drive by on a Saturday and see people actually waiting outside for a table.  Going here for a beer and some fries or wings to watch a game would be the only somewhat acceptable reason to be here.  The food is just like all the other Applebees, out of a can and overcooked then allowed to cool to just below room temperature. I'll be honest, i swore off Applebees for life a couple years ago but Ive been to this one many times and felt I had to warn you in case for some reason you are on yelp but would still consider going to Applebees.

The staff is really nice and I really appreciate that even though its a chain restaurant the manager takes the time to come over and ask how my meal is, even after my server asked. It just shows a real concern for customer satisfaction. Everytime I want a table that isn't in the section they would prefer, they never make it known. They are always calm and courteous. I appreciate them accommodating our love for the booth!  Food- lets get to the food. First of all no where in town will you find a an appetizer, two steaks, four side dishes for 20 bucks. .its just crazy cheap. And its good. There are like 5 other options and many of them are good too! We haven't had anything we don't like so much.  3RD I am super happy that they have a tiny brownie with a scoop of ice cream for ONE DOLLAR. yes, one fucking dollar! It's an awesome extra little treat.  Also, The soup at Applebees is like 5 star home made stuff!! Particurally the Tortilla soup..You can not go wrong with it! I am also a huge fan of Tuscan Bean with Chicken and Sausage. I don't usually write these but I just had to show Applebee's some love because they are consistently good. And when I was dieting I still came here because they have tons of actually good options that are low calorie!! I was pleasantly surprised when most menus have a low calorie section that is just flavorless blahhh . Ok.. all and all. great place!!

We started with the Ultimate Trio combo of Steak Quesadilla Towers, Brew Pub Pretzels and Spinach Artichoke dip. All were very good but the dip could have used more tortilla chips. I had the Bourbon Black & Blue burger and my wife had the Cowboy burger - both were good and we would both order them again. Service was quick and efficient. We did order the appetizer with our drinks so we received it first and were not even done with it by the time our burgers arrived. We were done and out the door by 6:30. We have had significant waits when going here later but that has been our experience at almost every restaurant in the area. I hate waiting so we eat early and avoid the hassle. My only complaint would be price - $15 for the appetizer and $10.40 for each burger but I guess that's par for the course with restaurants like this. At least the burgers come with fries.

I know that this one in particular is filled with high-school aged kids who normally have no manners toward their server, especially at this time of night. It was roughly 10 pm when my party of three was sat last night. The server, Donnie, was very friendly at first. But I don't think he was having a good night.  My friends and I had just finished a Painting With a Twist activity where we worked up a big appetite. But since the apps at Applebees are half price after 9, why not save us all some money and just order a couple appetizer's to share between us all? Anyway, as we were ordering the apps, the server had to verify that we wanted the ""half-price ones."" My guess is that for half the price, you also get half the portion, whatever. Our app's took about 15 minutes (not bad!) only to be ran by the table by someone other than our server. As we were all very hungry, we dug right in!  About 5 minutes into chatting and picking at our food, the server just dropped our check, while walking by, and said ""let me know if you's need anything. He didn't even ask if everything was okay, and it wasnt. The one order of BBQ must of came with 5 small pieces of boneless wings, and they were hardly tosed in sauce, one piece - was totally and completely dry. We also had to flag a manager down to ask for some sour cream with our nachos. So, figuring out that we were recieving no service whatsoever, we decided to finish up and get out of there.  Our check was $23.00. Since two of us at our table are servers and understand there are bad nights, we still left Donnie about $9.00. I really hope this guy understands that even though one or two tables may be totally rude toward you, you should still work as hard as you can to please the next. Clearly, we were not high school kids who wanted all seperate checks and the remote to a TV. We just wanted a pleseant bite to eat after a fun night of Painting.

The restaurant was very crowded with my fellow peers, which I can understand because this is the only place to go after a dance. I had also called in advance hoping to have a table for my party of 15. We were split up and 4 of us went over to one table and the rest of us were waiting on another table. We sit down and we unfortunately have a problem facing us! There isn't enough seats for all of us(btw we needed 1 extra seat). So we pull over a chair by the booster seats because there was a couple over there, and here comes the manager(Rick or Rich. He was wearing a blue shirt too) and he flips on us. He told us how we didn't listen in splitting up our group(which we did). So he said either leave or split up. But who would make someone sit by them self and not with there friends. There was even a couple behind us who were offering an extra chair they had. So I told him we were taking our business elsewhere(which I did[cocos]) and we left. But the one person I would like to thank is our very friendly server, Emma. Not only was she willing to help, but she also felt how we felt and that is how customers should be treated. Emma needs a raise or a promotion because how she handled it, was truly awesome! I really can't thank her enough though. Now that's how customers should be treated and Emma absolutely knows how to do her job!

0,Ann H.,"Lansdowne, PA",49,25,,3.0,2016-04-30,"Hubby and I had dinner heee tonight.  Was not a very pleasant experience.  After we were seated the waitress took our order and it took 20 minutes to get our salad.  I know they were busy but 20 minutes?  Then when dinner came mine wasn't good.  I ordered the sirloin stir fry.  It was supposed to be veggies and rice with the steak.  There were only 2 tiny pieces of red pepper, 3 slices of mushroom and some broccoli mixed with the rice.  No sauce at all.  The steak was tough and I had to add hot sauce just to give the meal some flavor.  Hubby said his steak was good but it will be quite awhile before I try them again.  The service was just ok too.  Not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
47,Kathie R.,"Clifton Heights, PA",0,6,,1.0,2016-05-31,"Went there for curb side service on 5/28/16, and it was the worst experience ever.  The person who took the cards for payment was to split it between two, and ran it twice on the same card, so had to go back and redo.  My son-in-law is an activer serviceman and there was to be a 10% discount.  We mentioned three times about the discount and when she ran the cards, she never put it on.  I guess math is not her strong point.  Then the worst is we get home and we are missing items, some meals were not as full as they should have been and I think grilled veggies should be cut and not put in as chunks.  Do yourself a favor and find a different Applebee's since this one has staff who are definitely challenged.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
38,Rob K.,"Collingdale, PA",32,106,79.0,4.0,2016-08-29,All in all a great restaurant. I'd give them 5 stars if not for the seemingly never ending turn over of employees. I wish for once I could go there and have my order taken and delivered correctly. The food is always good so I'm giving 5 stars simply for that reason. The always comp something whenever they make a mistake and that speaks to a culture of responsibility. I have no problem going there time and time again. I just don't set my expectations for 5 star service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
39,Kendra T.,"Morton, PA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2016-09-10,"Just ordered curbside to go via phone and it was horrible. After ordering on the phone, and giving all of the information, we were told 20-25min. My husband arrived 30min later, only to be told that they didn't have the order in the system. I call the restaurant to tell them about it, was put on hold and then hung up on. I then called back, they apologized and said it would be ready in 5-10min(she obviously lied just to get me off the phone). 15min min later I call my husband thinking he was on the way home, only for the food to still not be ready. I called the restaurant again, and requested to speak to the manager. His name was Jonathan. He half apologized, and asked for my mailing address, stating that he would send me a comment card. A comment card??? ...Why are you going to send me a comment card, when I'm telling you my ""comment"" right now.  In total, over an hour to get the food. When we got the food the proportions were VERY small and none of the dipping sauces I had previously requested... Long story short, wont be doing that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Forget what I ordered, wife got the grilled chicken salad and we were both starving.i it cones out and looks pretty good, then bam wife notices a piece of RAW chicken. Calls over server who sees it right away and apologizes a bunch, takes it back and has manager come over who removes from bill and also apologized. So raw chicken which is flat out unacceptable at any place, but I do think it was handled well. Obviously I won't go back but if you are a cliff diver or risk taker then I'd suggest going for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

31,Elaina C.,"Aston, PA",4,49,26.0,2.0,2017-04-26,"So I don't frequent Applebee's usually, and I always think to myself, why? Well, now I remember why I don't dine there often.  Applebee's in Folsom is always just so disappointing. Some friends and I went on a Wednesday evening after 9pm not thinking that it would be too crowded for a week night for a quick bite. We arrived and there was no wait which was great. We were seated right away and everything appeared that it would go smoothly. There weren't a lot of people in there the wait staff seemed to be fully staffed, tables were clean. One would think ok great this should be a positive experience, right?  Well, think again!  After being seated for 20 min then a server finally came over to us and said I promise I'll be right back to get your drink order. Yep, you read that correctly 20 min and still no drinks or even a drink order take . After another 10 min the server finally took out drink order and it took another 15 min for them to finally arrive to our table. We ordered quickly since we had a ton of time to review the menu. Once ordered 2 other tables that came in after us were severed their food first. Once our food finally came out half of the table's food was cold. No drink refills, one person's mozzarella sticks were cold and  soggy as well. The whole experience was so disappointing and not quality. For a few friends just wanting to go get some quick appetizers we wound up being there to almost midnight. 3 hours for not much food and horrible service. Good thing I love my friends or it would have been a total waste of time.  I surely will be remembering for the future why I don't frequent Applebee's. Not a positive experience and meh on the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-folsom-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
