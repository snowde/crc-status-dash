3,Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",279,192,83.0,3.0,2013-05-03,"This Applebee's has been here for years and I have had years worth of experiences eating here, both good and bad. So I settled on 3 stars. A-OK fits this place pretty well. Mostly, experiences depend on what time of day you come, what you order, and who your server is. Friday and Saturday nights, for example, tend to be packed houses with people waiting in lines out the door. The crowd is usually grown & hungry and less family friendly. And Applebee's has a pretty decent bar and cheap eats so it can turn into more of a hang out spot on the weekends. Some will try to leave here and opt for the Friday's up the street, which is just if not more crowded than here. If Applebee's isn't worth the potential long waits and big crowds, then opt for daytime hours. During the day, this place is completely chill. The last 3x I came here my servers  have all been pleasant and my food came out perfectly. I actually decided to jump out there and order a steak on the new 550 calories and under menu. If you're like me, you're probably skeptical of an Applebee's steak. But the price and calories were right so I took a chance. And it paid off. Applebee's managed to cook an absolutely perfect steak. Now I can't stop ordering that meal when I come. I've also recently had that new apple cinnamon dessert thing they have. I think it's like a dessert spring roll. DELICIOUS!!! I've been thoroughly and pleasantly surprised with the recent menu changes.  Pretty good taste bud bang for the buck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
2,Taheerah B.,"New Orleans, LA",388,436,145.0,4.0,2014-04-15,"I'm not an Applebee's fan, but I must admit, I haven't had this much fun on a Tuesday night since I was in undergrad.  My sister wanted to meet for dinner at Applebee's. Why would anyone want to eat at Applebee's when there are so many other choices in the DMV? I was annoyed when I got here, and it was packed. You mean to tell me that I have to wait 30 minutes for a table?!?! at Applebee's?!?! At this point, I was too hungry to leave. The wait wasn't as long as I expected because the people watching was the best.  Once seated, a dj was setting up. The music was loud, and the crowd was live. The server and hostesses were so upbeat. They looked like they truly enjoyed their jobs.  It was karaoke Tuesday! No wonder this place was live. The brave souls sang their hearts out. There were times were a popular song was on and the patrons danced in their seats. For dinner, I ordered a cheese sandwich and tomato soup. The sandwich tasted like a cheese pizza, but the soup was great. I was impressed with the quality. To drink, I had a mango margarita. I am convinced that the bartender forgot to put the mango flavoring in my cup. That was the strongest margarita I EVER had, and it was at Applebee's. I WILL be back :-)  Overall, I had so much fun there. It was more like club Applebee's. It was relaxing to laugh and have great conversations with complete strangers. The vibe was great. True, franchise restaurants are usually a solid 3- stars, but this Applebee's was a step above. I felt like I was a Deep South family reunion--- good food, strong drinks, awesome music, and great people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

It was a different experience for me because it had a party type of feel. It was refreshing for me being African American and not many places to hang out at a fun affordable price in the DMV area. It may seem a bit bizarre for someone outside being familiar with our culture but it is a breath of fresh air. I invited my best friend the next week and she felt right at home. We are both from Michigan.  P. S Our drinks and food was great. She ordered a pasta,  I had shrimp. We kept it simple because we usually don't go to chain restaurants.  p.s.s There is police present, which is not the norm for  Apple bees but neither is the type of night they have.

If you want to have a good time asks for David. He was very attentive and helpful with the drink selections and appetizers. I came here with my two sisters on a Saturday night. Luckily we found a table around the bar area. FYI Saturday nights are extremely busy so come here early if you want to grab a table or booth in the bar area.  We ordered 2 long islands, 2 margaritas, 4 lemon drop shots and a sweet tea for the designated driver.. I love, love, love lemon drop martinis and shots. The shots was only $3!!  The bartender put them in a martini glass which was awesome and gave you more than just a regular shot. I totally forgot to take a picture of the lemon drop.

35,Cookie J.,"District Heights, MD",184,2,5.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"After eating a subpar meal.....i asked our waiter for a cup of crushed ice to go. Long story short.....while waiting for the check...i noticed there was a bug inside of my ice. I'm very understanding to the low class resturaunt industry... I hadn't seen our waiter and noticed the manager was closer....... I got his attention and showed him my cup of crushed ice with the bug in it. He grabs the cup and says ""this is something from the bar, it's not even a bug"" I respond tactfully and let him know that it looks like a bug so it is a bug....he then brushes my concern off and hastily asks what he would like me to do.....i said I need to be compensated $10 off the entire bill ....(being the understanding person that I am) that's all I wanted.... So while he's doing absolutely nothing for 10 minutes ....its hitting me that the manager of a resturaunt just basically tried to insult my intelligence by telling me that its wasn't a bug. So he arrives back at our table about 10 minutes later and says something about he was unable to give me refund bc I already ""cashed out""..so upset I respond and calmly but stern and ask why he tried to tell me that wasn't a bug in my ice. He responds and says ""yeah when I looked at it at first It didn't look like one but I went to the back and looked at it....i seen that it was a bug""...i respond and say yeah duh because it had legs right....!!!... He proceeded to offer me food credits or free drinks and I denied because I don't want anything else with legs I it......ok so Already long story short....i raised hell until the nonchalant, ignorant, unqualified idiot of a ""manager"" introduced   his general manager...Enrique .... Enrique totally listened to my tactful frustrations and handed me a $10 bill.... I then shook his hand and left. I didn't care if he cared or not.....there was a bug in my item that I ordered for consumption from your establishment .....give me what I want!

Not sure if the servers are trained to do this.  5) I am eating my entrees while the dirty plates from my appetizers are still on the table.  6) I don't even get a water refill. 7) my table was visited only once. 8) dirty plates attract the flies to come in to my table and this is really bad because now I no longer feel like visiting this place of his disgusting this is. 9) Please have servers to check on your tables more often.  10) Retrain all staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville,,,,,

Granted, she did tell us there were only 2 servers, but I'm sorry, that's no excuse.

Please hire BETTER EMPLOYEES that actually CARE about what they're doing! It was pretty sad and pathetic that no one seems to take their job seriously.

We decided to go to Applebee's because my past experiences have been decent. Not sure if this chain is franchise owned but this place is the pits. We were seated rapidly. The waitress showed up 20 minutes later but the place was not crowded. She took our orders. My mother ordered a bowl of soup. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The waitress took our order and returned with two forks and two napkins. One of the forks was dirty. Figuring she did not realize my mom had ordered soup, I merely pointed out that one of the forks was dirty thinking should would return with a full complement of silverware as eating soup requires a spoon. Once again she returned with two forks and no spoons or knives.  It took nearly another 40 minutes to deliver our meals and when she returned with my cheeseburger there was no mayo, and no mustard on the table or in cups on the side. I had to go to another table to grab the ketchup.  So, I called her back to the table again and asked for mayo and mustard. By now my food is starting to get cold. I only maintained my composure because my mother was present.  Once done we were presented with the bill. There were extra charges for bacon which I did not order for the burger or receive and a charge for some game that sits on the table that we did not play. We disputed the bill. That process too another 20 minutes to be corrected.  Completely tacky. I have been in some of the best burger dives in this country. This is a chain of restaurants not a stand alone burger place. I expect some sort of professionalism. They surely have to be disregarding Applebee's corporate standards.  I saw other disgruntled customers on the way out.
