1,Carlos B.,"Washington, DC",26,3,,1.0,2017-10-29,"Ordered to go, servers were clueless on how to handle an order to go, where to go, who to go to, etc Ok our order was simple: Shelby had 6oz steak medium cooked Taters and green beans Lauren and Kirsten shared the mini sliders kids meal with fries Miriam had original cheese burger with fries I had the baby back ribs Taters and green beans  Food was way over cooked and dry as hell.  Stick to Chili's in Forney if u want decent service and food Moral of the story don't spend $50 for crap food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forney-2,,,,,
