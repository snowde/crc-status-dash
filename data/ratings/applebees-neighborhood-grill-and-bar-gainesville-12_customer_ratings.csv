8,Jenn C.,"Gainesville, FL",20,37,53.0,5.0,2015-04-03,"This location has only been open a couple weeks. By 6 pm the place was packed, so be sure to come early. Our server Kaala  was right on point, fast fun and friendly. The food was served hot and taste great! If you like mac and cheese my recamendation is the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey peperjack chicken, its to die for.  They have online ordering for a quick and easy pic up if u rather enjoy dinner at home. Or come out for happy hour 2 for 1 specials.  This is my fist trip and I give them 5 stars all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
12,Kris C.,"Gainesville, FL",42,135,79.0,4.0,2015-04-16,"It's an Applebee's... Everyone knows what an Applebee's is. Tchotchke's right? It's new, clean, cheap (food and beverage) and is one of the only places on this side of town with typical American fare that isn't a ""bar"". Yes American fare with the bits and pieces of Americanized Asian, Mexican etc. The chicken quesadilla is the best of the appetizers. The appetizer short ribs are rib tips with bones in them- be careful. Boneless wings and won tons were meh. I'll update as I try the menu. It's been over a year... Maybe two since I've been in an Applebee's so I can't go into my favs... Yet! The layout seems more open than other locations and has a TON of TVs. It's definitely more schwanky than other Applebee's. Much more up to date looking inside.  In good time... A year or so... it will be just like the rest of them... So go now while it's shiny a new!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
16,Joyce D.,"Bell, FL",0,3,,2.0,2015-04-21,"We were seated right away and a manager took our drink order. The good service ended there. We waited an additional 15 minutes before our waitress showed up. She took our order. Waited awhile longer and the soup and entree arrive at the same time. Told them to take the soup away since it came out so late. The steak was cooked well, broccoli was raw and cold. Dessert was OK, not quite prepared correctly. The highlight was the drinks. Great job to the bartender. The check arrived with the soup still on there, so we sent it back for an adjustment. I doubt I'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
14,Elisabeth M.,"Newberry, FL",0,11,2.0,2.0,2015-06-11,The service was great. That's where the good ends. Christy was absolutely fantastic to us. The bartender however was literally the SLOWEST I have come across in a long time. She was terrible. She couldn't make drinks correctly. I and my friends had bar flies in our drinks and the manager never once came over. Maybe the manager should have stepped behind the bar to help the bartender in the service bar since she was swamped with her 3 bar guests and 1 table....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
18,Robert N.,"Gainesville, FL",0,5,,2.0,2015-06-14,Ate there yesterday for our granddaughter's birthday. The server didn't seem know what the soup of the day might be. The food took forever to get to us and they kept bringing out other people's orders and asking if they were ours. When the food did arrive they didn't ask if our granddaughter wanted ketchup for her fries and her mom's medium rare steak was medium at best. They tried to make her another one and they didn't do any better. They constantly came to our table with someone else's food including the manager. They just seemed overwhelmed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
6,Brad K.,"Gainesville, FL",112,747,1705.0,3.0,2015-06-17,"This is their new location in town. Decided to give them a try. Service was very good and attentive.  Its been a while since we've dined at Applebee's given all the other excellent local non-chain eats we have here in Gainesville.  The menu had a good variety. Everyone ordered what they wanted. The food came out quickly. Can't say we'll be back anytime soon. This location since its new is nice, clean and hip. Nice bar in the middle of the place. The food just doesn't impress ! I'm sure we'll be back, just not soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
17,Brent C.,"Gainesville, FL",1,5,,2.0,2015-07-10,Restaurant was new and clean. Menu looked promising with lots of new additions. Food was big disappointment. Four cheese macaroni with peppered chicken strips tasted bland. Chicken not freshly cooked and my kids Kraft Mac n cheese tastes better than my dinner. Wife's food was not any better. Will not be frequenting this establishment again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
13,Gerald H.,"Gainesville, FL",34,11,3.0,4.0,2015-08-09,"Awesome!  Korey A. was great!  We just had some beer and apps, but they were very tasty and reasonably priced.  The beer was also very cold and fresh!!  Long live Brewtus!  The only reason for not giving five stars is that things could have been a little more on the ship shape side as far as cleanliness of the grounds and dinning room.  We shall return! Also FYI you are allowed to smoke on the patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
9,Eric B.,"San Antonio, TX",31,304,197.0,4.0,2015-08-27,"This is your typical Applebee's however the staff definitely made an impression.  I sat at the Bar and instantly the Bar tender (George M) waited on me, asking me if I was going to just gave a drink or have dinner as well.  He also recommended some meals that were on special, which of course I tried out... and... was NOT disappointed as I had the Brunch Burger... I LOVE the idea of bacon and Egg on a burger... OUTSTANDING.... and I highly recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,

11,Itsm E.,"Gainesville, FL",3,151,16.0,5.0,2015-12-13,Ate here yesterday and the service and food were yummy. There was hardly anyone inside and my waiter was great and attentive when I needed something. The location is easy to get to and there's lots of parking. I gonna try something new to order every time I come here because their menu is amazeballsssss!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
19,Kelsey L.,"Fort White, FL",0,16,8.0,4.0,2016-01-02,"I give this four stars for the food. It was delicious. I got the bourbon steak and strimp and my boyfriend got the slab of ribs. Our app was boneless chicken wings (excellent!!!) My only aggravation was the waiter, Joseph M. It was all good in the beginning he gave us our drinks and all was okay. But then when he gave us our entrees it was over. He didn't take up our plates from the appetizer, and he didn't refill our drinks. We tried waving him down for ten minutes and had to ask him to refill them. We were done with our meal by the time he got us our drinks. We were in the middle booth between two parties and he completely ignored us. He asked the other two if they needed anything  and how was the food but walked right by us. Not to mention we are late teens early twenties and we were never rude to him even when he was rude to us. But the place was clean and food was good. Good job chefs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
10,Brian A.,"Gainesville, FL",36,278,149.0,3.0,2016-01-08,It beat chili's but if you get their take out sometime the food comes in little bags with the days of the week written on them I'm assuming they just heat my food in the microwave at this point.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
2,Ben B.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,39,13.0,2.0,2016-04-15,"Appetizer: mozzarella sticks. Frozen from a box. Served cold, soggy and greasy.  Entrees: 1) ""bourbon"" steak. Didn't get asked how I wanted it cooked. Didn't ask what side I wanted with it. Served Lukewarm, overlooked and flavorless. Specifically asked for no mushrooms due to allergy. Found 2 mushrooms in the onions under the steak. Sat the rest of the meal waiting to see if I was going to break out in hives. And 2) Cesar salad w/ grilled shrimp & french onion soup. Soup was warm (not hot) and thick as gravy. Salad was flavorless, as were the cold ""grilled"" shrimp.  $70 (incl drinks) for one of the worst meals. Not one person asked how the food was; incl the manager who had been summoned to the table that behind us for some other fiasco. Despite so much food being left on the table, wasn't offered a to-go box or inquired about the food. The final insult was walking out the door past 3 hostesses who looked right at us and didn't say a word; not ""good night, see you next time,"" nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
4,Nan T.,"Gainesville, FL",16,316,2441.0,3.0,2016-07-18,"Not a fan of chains, but was dragged here by friends. At least it was not horrible like the 13th St location, but it is still no place I'd intentionally return. Our waitress was new, poorly trained, or just plain lousy. She seldom checked on us, our drinks sat near empty or empty, she couldn't tell us the drink specials & appeared content not to figure out what they were, and our food came out at different times. The burger was quite tasty, but unfortunately it and the bun were the smallest I've ever been served in any restaurant. The fries were bland. The cheese stick appetizer appeared to have been the previously frozen kind. THE POSITIVES: The French onion soup was very good; I would order it again; however, I have no plans to return. My company liked their lime chicken meals as well as the chicken Cesar salad. The latter appeared to have plenty of chicken. MISC: The restaurant appeared clean. The women's bathroom was clean. And the bar area was modern and nice. The restaurant acoustics aren't so great; the loud piped in music made it difficult to talk. Parking is in the back except for approx 6 spaces on the side. Elderly & disabled people may have difficulty if all the side spots are already taken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
7,Leigh R.,"Gainesville, FL",21,13,1.0,2.0,2016-11-02,Very slow service when I went inside for the first time. When I called to place a to go order the man was so rude it was ridiculous. But I was pregnant so I really was craving their mashed potatoes so I still bought it. But the man who took my order was beyond ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
5,Kira C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",180,7,,2.0,2017-04-15,"Our visit started out well and took a turn for the worst. My friend and I both ordered the 4cheese Mac and cheese with chicken tenders and we both did not like it at all! The chicken was covered in a lot of sweet sauce and the Mac and cheese barely had any taste considering it was ""4 cheese"". It was like pasta and sauce because the sauce got everywhere. We both were so disappointed that we ordered new meals. Other than that the waiter was helpful when we expressed our disdain and the manager came and apologized which was nice. But then we saw our waiter smoking near our car. I don't think we'll be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
3,Kimmy B.,"Davie, FL",5,56,12.0,2.0,2017-04-20,"Bar service was great. Hubby's Cesar salad had way too much dressing and his bourbon chicken and shrimp which was excessively hot. As in temperature, not spice. I had the ""new"" spinach artichoke chicken cavitappi pasta dish. After eating half of it thinking ""where's the artichoke?"" I realized it was spinach artichoke dip on top of pasta. Definitely not how it is described in the menu. Menu makes it seem as if it's fresh artichoke and spinach. I asked about it and the bar tender was honest about it and confirmed my suspicions. We'll prob coke back because it's close to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-12,,,,,
