19,Marcus S.,"Sherman, TX",0,3,,1.0,2014-11-13,They didn't give us what we ordered and there were things floating in the soda and it took forever for a refill,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
17,Jessica S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,11,,2.0,2015-08-30,"Very slow wait staff, food mediocre at best. Should have gone next door to Cracker Barrel- food would have been worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
16,Tucker P.,"Wylie, TX",66,11,2.0,3.0,2015-09-13,"Menu has improved a lot since I last ate at Applebee's -- surprisingly so! Had the new ""loaded"" Mac and cheese with chicken and bacon. Waitress was helpful and responsive. Nice place to go when the casino restaurants are packed for the evening. Just 10 minutes south.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
13,Dave R.,"Royse City, TX",17,72,44.0,5.0,2015-10-18,"Wow. Great meal for a great price. My wife and I were out of there for less than $45.00 and we even left a $7.50 tip! Our waiter, Cameron, was great. Very pleasant, patient and knowledgeable. We had the 2 for $20 / $25, wife had the 7 oz sirloin and I had the bourbon glazed steak. It was great!! Very hot, served on a hot plate, hot right down to the last bite. Nice clean facility, too. So few good choices at the casino with all that SICKENINGLY STINKING CIGARETTE SMOKE ODOR so we decided to head south and enjoy a great meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and I'm kinda picky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
14,Chad B.,"Gainesville, TX",46,9,3.0,5.0,2015-11-12,"Nothing like a night out at Bee's. Vaping allowed in the bar ares, always friendly staff and delicious food. Can't beat the Berry Cocktails.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
12,Chris C.,"Marietta, OK",7,79,27.0,2.0,2016-01-26,"Wow, pretty poor visit.  Steak had no flavor and was luke warm while the potatoes were runny with Cold spots in them.  Veggies were not hot either.  I do not think we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
10,DeeDee D.,"Denton, TX",44,32,5.0,2.0,2016-03-17,They changed their menu for the worse. No more cowboy burger. No more American BLT. They actually did make the BLT for me even though it was not on menu but not the same. It use to be loaded with bacon. There was two slices on it this time. See picture and note the whole top half of bread has NOTHING on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
15,Matthew K.,"Abilene, TX",9,1,,5.0,2016-05-30,Awesome place was down in gainsville and decided to eat here after the casino and it was amazing the staff is great and very helpful next time I'm down i will definitely go back here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
18,Alex L.,"Aubrey, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-16,"So we just ate here, and I would not recommend this Applebee's. For starters the server we had was awful. Her name was Lyndi? She stood at the bar on her phone nearly the entire time and didn't even come to take our order til the bartender told her, we were looking at her. Then the computer system went down so we had to wait extra long for our food. Then on top of that our appetizer came out after our food. Finally after I saw her on the phone again while we were waiting for her to bring us drink refills, and ranch because she wouldn't refill our drinks unless we asked her too. I asked to speak to the manager about our awful service and he didn't even apologize or anything. He told us he would talk to her. Which did absolutely nothing. Nothing changed. I've never been so irritated with a server before. She needs to probably find a new job that involves standing around on her phone. If you get that waitress I suggest requesting another one!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
11,Chavela G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,3,,1.0,2016-07-29,I wish there was a negative star I could give. I would this is my first time at this location. We waited 30 min after ordering to receive our drinks (water & lemonade).. but thats not where it started we were skipped over to be seated. When seated we weren't given menus while others seated after us got drinks. This place I will never come to agai,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
4,James S.,"Plano, TX",34,136,139.0,5.0,2017-01-01,What's great dinner. I had the chicken and rice and my wife had the shrimp. Service was great and the area was clean and we settled in nicely.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
9,Marc L.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,1.0,2017-04-09,"Worst Applebee's ever! Terrible service, badly prepared food, and filthy bathroom. I generally like Applebee's, but will definitely avoid the Gainesville, TX location.  They brought us sweet tea when we ordered unsweet. Wife ordered brisket tacos with no pico de gayo and stressed that she cannot eat it. We know the waitress heard because she offered to bring it on the side and my wife said ""no thanks. I don't want it at all."" I ordered a steak dinner (think it was called bourbon st sirloin). Server tried to walk away without asking how I wanted it cooked so I stopped her and told her I'd like it medium rare. Wife's tacos came out covered in pico de gayo and my steak was well done. I ate the steak, but we had to send back the tacos and wait for a new order. About 15-20 minutes later we still hadn't gotten them so we asked the manager to check on them and he brought them right out. Pretty sure they were ready for a while and our waitress just didn't feel like bringing them. After the manager brought the tacos out nobody came back to our table until the waitress brought the bill. It was definitely not just us, either, because we saw and heard people at 4 other tables telling the manager how unhappy they were too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
7,L S.,"Valley View, TX",0,22,43.0,2.0,2017-05-15,Nice new place. Ordered a club soda with a lime. Wasn't sure if they carried it.....came without a lime. Down hill from there. Did not seem to be concerned and not much staff. Ordered the Asian salad w/grilled chicken and oriental vinaigrette. It was cold slaw dressing. Who puts mayonnaise on Asian food. Just awful. Ate the chicken and called it a day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
6,Jennifer F.,"Valley View, TX",88,17,3.0,5.0,2017-05-21,"Me and my husband went to the new location yesterday for the first time since they moved. The service was amazing! The renovation looked great and they even added pool tables! Applebee's has pub style food and they incorporated that feel to the decor. My husband ordered a steak that was cooked to perfection. I ordered the current special which was grilled salmon, skewered shrimp, and the bacon green beans. The fish was absolutely perfect and not overlooked like most salmon is at restaurants. The server was very kind and attentive. We complimented the food and the management team came to our table to thank us. We will lee the business coming you guys!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
8,Linda H.,"Sanger, TX",28,1,,2.0,2017-05-30,Worst Applebee's ever watch your ticket when you go in there the prices on the menu will not match your ticket the dollar drafts all day everyday is for one kind of beer and they don't tell you which beer until after you've ordered and you get a Big Bill the manager is a snippy guy doesn't seem to care much about customer service first and last trip to Gainesville Applebee's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
5,Hannah B.,"Gainesville, TX",0,1,,2.0,2017-07-30,Chips were stale. Appetizer came out with food. Food wasn't right. The food that was right tasted great though! Usually we have a lot better service than this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
3,Lance B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,5,,5.0,2017-10-05,"Good service,even better food but if you really want the best service go sit at the bar when Tom is there! He's the man he makes great drinks is very friendly and just all around gives absolute great service. The price on drinks are good the only down fall is little to no craft beer..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
2,Kaye C.,"McKinney, TX",0,65,1.0,4.0,2017-10-28,"This was not a typical Applebee's.  It almost looked like a bar instead of a restaurant.  The food was good and fresh and our waitress (Kodi I believe) was very sweet and professional.  They have pool tables, tv with sports and a jukebox. I can see this being a fun place to hang out on weekends.  And their $1 margaritas were very good and had more alcohol in them than I expected for $1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
1,Corey R.,"Grand Prairie, TX",52,116,319.0,3.0,2017-12-03,This place is alright. A great option to walk to from the La Quinta next door. It's open until 2 am and one of the few bars around so it's a great place to check out some locals and their late night drama. The bar staff is friendly and so are the patrons. Go late night and there are quite a few deals with the late night happy hour.  Applebee's now has $1 Long Island iced teas. They poor it from something that is premixed and they are quite sweet. I would avoid them unless you are just looking for a cheap hangover. There are a number of cheap beer specials but very few craft beer options.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gainesville-9,,,,,
