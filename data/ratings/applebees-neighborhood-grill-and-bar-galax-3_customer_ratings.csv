6,Rachel W.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-18,"My friend and I came here last night and once we were seated we waited for 15 minutes for a server to come. At that point, we used the tablet on the table to call a server. The tablet flashed for another five minutes, but no one ever even came to take our drink order after those twenty minutes... so we left. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the food since we didn't make it that far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,
4,Harold C.,"Wilmington, NC",0,4,1.0,1.0,2015-12-30,"The beer was priced way high for a domestic, four dollars come on. Ordered small ribs and they were small! The fries looked like someone had already ate some of them. Very small. Will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,

0,Lisa L.,"Pulaski, VA",0,35,7.0,3.0,2016-09-14,"We are locals but rarely dine here (basically because of the price and I have never been a fan of their menu). We came in today because we had a coupon for a free entree. I was tickled to see $1.50 Margaritas all day/everyday so I tried one of those. My husband ordered the sizziling sirloin which he loved. I ordered the 6oz sirlion and it was ok. The staff brought our plates out and asked us to cut into them to make sure they were cooked to our liking. This must be something restaurants are doing now..I've never seen this before but I don't eat a lot of steak out either. I had ""bacon and cheese potatoes"" and four cheese macaroni with my meal. My potatoes were hardly bacon and cheese. They came with 4 or 5 bacon bits and 4 shreds of shredded cheese.  But they were good. The macaroni tasted off and I was upcharged .50 for it for it being a signature item. Now let's get to the margarita. Even if it says they are only $1.50...skip it. It's way too sweet! Their mix is horrible. I should have realized it when it came out that funky color. Next time I will take them up on their $1.50 Coors or Miller Lite. We sat in the bar area and service was decent. I wish she would have checked on us when our meal was brought out to check on refills and condiments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,
5,Jamey H.,"Spotsylvania Courthouse, VA",0,2,,1.0,2016-12-26,"Service was terrible, sat for 15 minutes without even a drink order taken. Place was so dirty. Table and floors were nasty. After order taken another 10 minutes no sign of drinks. Had to leave. Not the waitresses fault just poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,
1,Jaime T.,"Woodlawn, VA",94,97,369.0,1.0,2017-06-27,"Despite decent food, the sub-par service only warrants a 1-star overall review because our dining experience was ruined and we won't ever be coming back... Here's the ""highlight"" reel: upon our arrival, we told the waitress that the table was sticky but she blamed it on the humidity and didn't even attempt to wipe it down... Food took 30 minutes to come out (it was just a chicken wrap with fries) and the fries were cold; when we informed the waitress, she copped an attitude and stomped off to have the kitchen fry up another serving... Found a hair in the condiment cup of dressing that came with the wrap and, again, the waitress acted as of she was being put out when we asked to swap it out for another... At no time were we ever rude or discourteous, we simply brought the issues to her attention but were continuously met with nasty reactions, which was entirely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,
2,Joan E.,"Woodlawn, VA",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-27,"We waited 15 minutes, and although there were very few customers, no one took our orders.  Not one employee spoke to us after we were seated .  We will not be back !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-galax-3,,,,,
