9,Richard H.,"Hinckley, OH",172,230,181.0,4.0,2013-09-01,"I am not sure why Applebee's gets such a bad rap.. I have never had a bad meal here and the drinks are consistent and good. I realize its a chain and owned by an evil corporation out to destroy mom and pop businesses.. but the appetizers are pretty tasty.. I like this location because it is close to where i live and has a pretty good view. Prices are decent and when they have one of those ""If your server doesn't mention x then you get a free x"", your server will most certainly not mention what ever it was they were supposed to.. I get a lot of free crap here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
10,Tamra U.,"Cleveland, OH",0,1,,1.0,2014-11-24,This visit which will be my last..worst service I've ever experienced.  Had to wait to be be seated. .no hostess until the manager acknowledged us. 35 min wait to receive our food. Service was less than you should ever expect.  Was held hostage to get our check and get out..which is why I have time to write this review. .avoid this location unless you're into bondage and mental torture.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
7,Jason N.,"Independence, OH",60,67,84.0,4.0,2015-08-26,"OK, I know.  It's Applebee's, so many of you restaurant connoisseurs are making a smooshy face right now and considering clicking away. And that's OK - the fact that there are only three reviews of Applebee's on Vista Way tells me that either yelpers don't eat there or they are too embarrassed to check in. I feel you, but I'm totally cool with Applebee's. There's nothing generally ""big deal"" about this chain restaurant. My wife and I were dating almost twenty years ago at the Applebee's in Middleburg, so maybe I have a little sentimental thing happening (and I do honestly miss that old formulation of the Tequila Lime Chicken) but also, it's really a good spot if, like me, you have two 16 year olds who just completed an athletic event and hadn't had dinner yet because the varsity matches don't start until 7 PM (we won, by the way).  Just because there is no ""big deal"" doesn't mean I won't eat there - as you can see by my reviews, I'm a big fan of greasy spoons and dives, so Applebee's is a big night out for me. Well, not really, but I don't have an automatic judgment for Applebee's either. So the details: The restaurant was nearly completely empty at 9:30 PM on a Tuesday which was not unexpected. We were of course seated immediately. The service was very efficient and the food items came out quickly and correctly. All of this is good because there was absolutely no reason for any kind of error to happen. Some mozzarella sticks, A burger, some macaroni and cheese with shrimp, and a Thai salad. All the food was good and the service was good as well. Like I said, no culinary ground is really being broken here. One nice special was the dessert S'mores Churros. A Churro as you probably know is a fried dough dessert that is usually in a stick or tube form and rolled in sugar and cinnamon. In this case, the churros were served with warm dipping chocolate and marshmallow fluff. The teens were quite happy to eat them. Bill for three with dessert was around $45 including tip.  I feel like I should address the issue of the building site since one person seems to have reviewed the architecture rather than the actual restaurant - yes, the Vista View site was built on a landfill, and yes Wal-Mart ran out on their lease because of the perception of instability - allegations of gas leaking from the landfill into structures, et cetera. These issues have all been investigated by multiple agencies independent of the city and the developers, and if these structures were unsafe these businesses would not operate here. The side where the Applebees is has quite a few restaurants in place. It does look like a barren wasteland looking toward the Giant Eagle plaza, and there is a partially built structure nearby - so I agree that it's not picturesque, but since I'm not reviewing geology or structural engineering, I'm giving this restaurant good marks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
8,Rachel G.,"Cleveland, OH",0,14,6.0,4.0,2015-12-28,"Wegives this place a four. ""You got some bomb chicken"" says my date. ""And I like your fries, I just don't understand why you would not have fries and chicken in the same order. That is really unfair"" She continued on with other complaints. But then she concluded they, the fries and chicken were both amazing. The fries had their signature seasoning and the boneless wings  dipped in buffalo sauce ultimately made her become a fan. Those electronic order machines were probably a hefty investment for the company but we think unnecessary. Definitely will be back to try more options on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
5,Thomas K.,"Strongsville, OH",4,58,,5.0,2016-10-07,"My mother and I went here for lunch yesterday.  Not crowded at all at 12:45pm. We got the '2 for $20' deal which is always what I end up getting at Applebee's.  Large, tasty portions on the entrees, large hot vegetable sides.  Very good service.  Honestly the only thing that I could complain about is that the table could have been cleaned a little better before we sat down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,

4,Lynn M.,"Cleveland, OH",88,14,27.0,1.0,2017-04-01,"Don't even bother going here, every time I go in service is terrible there commute no one in the restaurants and the service will be so slow! Not only is the service bad but the food taste very commercialized",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
2,Jason D.,"Cleveland, OH",44,67,203.0,5.0,2017-06-25,This is my first time at this location we had a great server named Melissa she was very attentive food was great we were seated fast and all staff was friendly . When you enter you have to veer off to the left or you will be at Steak and Shake there is alot of vacant property around but conveniently located off Transportation Blvd off 480. Kudos Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
3,Joshua P.,"Cleveland, OH",27,21,19.0,1.0,2017-07-14,I have gone to this one multiple times just hoping that it'll change but it never will the service is absolutely horrible it's always a terrible wait and nothing is ever right not only that but it's disappointing to wait that long just to get an order that's messed up and has to be sent back it's also not the cleanest I have noticed that everytime I'm there the tables and booths even the menus just feel sticky and unclean,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
1,Samantha S.,"Grapevine, TX",3,3,,1.0,2018-01-01,"Poor service. The waiters were all standing around singing along to the music. Very weird. When they weren't singing, they were gossiping loudly to each other. No one in my party was happy with their food quality. Poor cuts of meat, poorly cooked. Also the bathroom had huge puddles of water in it. Definitely will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
0,Cameron H.,"Cleveland, OH",92,3,,3.0,2018-01-04,I visited this new Applebee's with a friend.  It's Kinda hard to find at night so you guys should light up that sign so we can see it. As well add some lighting to that back path to get there.  Jay was my server. He was decent and pleasant but seemed really rehearsed.  My Perfect Margaritas took 20 minutes to come out but that wasn't my servers fault. We watched the bartender just not make them.  I ordered the onion Soup and it wasn't hot. I ate it cuz I love onion soup and I hate sending food back.  I wasn't the happiest about this visit but I love Applebee's so I'll be back. Just get it together guys.  #ColorTheCritic,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield-heights,,,,,
