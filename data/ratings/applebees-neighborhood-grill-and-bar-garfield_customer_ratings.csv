We ended up doing the 2 for $20 meals bc we had a $25 giftcard . So I got the sizzling chicken and shrimp with a parmesan cheese sauce accompanied by rice pilaf and  peppers. It was pretty tasty, I'm not gonna lie. We had the buffalo bites. They had a pretty spicy flavor, I liked them. I was surprised... My bf got the steak and red potatoes. He ordered it cooked well done, but it was literally bloody in the middle. I told him not to expect an awesome steak from Applebee's , DUH... And for like $2 my daughter got a side order of fries.The portion size of the main entrees were a little skimpy. But for $24 in total, it wasn't horrible. Would I got to Applebee's without a free gift card? Probably not... But i may check out the half price apps after 10pm  the other Yelpers keep talking about,...

41,Matt V.,"Moonachie, NJ",131,9,27.0,2.0,2015-06-07,"I came here last night with five of my friends for a quick bite to eat around 11. The place still seemed pretty busy and there was a wait for tables. We gave the hostess our name and she took our phone # to notify us when our table was ready, but did not give us a quote time of approximately how long we would have to wait. After about 10 minutes, we asked if our table would be ready soon since there was a long booth that had been empty since we got there. Two of my friends had to leave, so now that we only had four people, we were sat soon after. The waitress we had came shortly after and took our drink and dinner orders. We did the 2 for $20 combo and got our appetizers before our drinks. Everything seemed to be fine until we got our entrees. I had told the waitress that I wanted the 3 cheese penne and when the food came by two other servers, I had gotten the chicken and fries basket and told them the mistake. Shortly after, our waitress came over and said she had fixed it and my food would be coming out shortly. She had also failed to notice that our drinks were empty so I had asked her for refills as well. After my food came and we all ate, we had to wait about 5 minutes for the check, and when the check finally came, the waitress had charged me for the 2 for $20 and the pasta separately as if I was paying for two entrees. We went up to a manager and he fixed the problem right away. Overall, the service was very slow and the server was inattentive. She tried to make up for her mistakes by telling jokes, but I wasn't buying it. I used to come here a lot, but I can tell that the staff has changed and that there is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully, there will be a more positive experience for future guests because I was not satisfied at all with my past few visits here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield?start=40,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

43,Edward T.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",149,66,,1.0,2016-01-28,"I don't like posting negative reviews, because the livelihood of people is involved, but I also believe in honesty. In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and eat in them as seldom as possible (although my elderly father has a taste for the Olive Garden and I guess you could consider me a regular, albeit reluctant, patron of that chain establishment). I've dined occasionally at different Applebee's with friends, and it's always what you'd expect-- lots of undistinguished but basically satisfying food for not a ton of money. Not this time. My dining companion wanted to come to this Garfield location, and, as it was her birthday and I was picking up the tab, I said, ""Hey, no problem.""  We were seated promptly, and we both ordered the Brisket Enchiladas, which looked immense in the photograph on the menu. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup to open.  I had a Coke, my companion had wine. At some point after ordering, a gentleman, who I assumed was the chef, came over to us and explained that the dish we had ordered was spicy, and he just wanted to caution us. My thought was, ""This is an Applebee's; how spicy could it be?"" My companion asked that hers not be too spicy, and I concurred. The gentleman was nice and helpful, but this had never happened in any Applebee's I had ever been in, and some instinct was alerted in me. The soup was ok-- nothing more, nothing less than what I expected. The main course, however, was something else again. The Enchiladas, which looked gigantic on the menu (and thoughtfully had a paper cup of Jalapeno peppers provided on the side of the plate), were puny indeed when viewed on the reality of the plate, more an appetizer than a main course. They were covered in white-yellow glop, and were lukewarm at best. There was more of the rice on the plate than anything else, but it was pretty tasteless. Again, I'm not very picky when it comes to chain restaurants--- I'm aware of what I'm getting into when I go into one--- but if I had 3 bites of meat in this ostensibly ""meaty"" main course, that was a lot. My companion complained about the lukewarm heat of the meal to the management, and they seemed to take it in good stride. But later, after we had left, it began to belatedly really steam me up. Places like Applebee's are popular because they're relatively cheap. However, upon reflection, this place wasn't really cheap. Given the quality of the meals we were served, it was appalling. The next morning, I complained about the meal to my companion, and said, ""We should have been more vocal about it."" She said the meal had been horrendous, then corrected herself; ""It wasn't horrendous, but it was very, very mediocre."" Again, reading negative reviews can sometimes prove entertaining, but I don't like writing them, because I recognize that people in the restaurant business, especially the chain restaurant business, generally work very hard for not much money. And the people in this place seemed nice, helpful, and efficient enough when it came to service. Still, if the purpose of Yelp is to give an honest appraisal, I have to be honest here. Maybe it was fluke; maybe not. But I left feeling cheated, quite frankly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

Normally I'm not a big steak eater, but wanted to see if the new menu and marketing for this chain had improved things from the past. Sadly it had not, I ordered the sirloin medium rare,  when I finally got it.... (23 minutes later) it was closer to medium well than medium. Being the son of a butcher I feel I know my steaks pretty well and this by far was one of the worst pieces of meat ever. It was not only cooked poorly, but was tough and stringy. I literally could hardly cut it with a steak knife. I left about 80% of it uneaten as I just couldn't chew it any longer.

1,Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",255,342,2310.0,3.0,2017-02-14,"I usually stay clear of most chains as much as possible just because I think the food is usually predictable as far as level of tatste. I was invited out to be treated tonight and YeAhhhhhhhh free meal why not lol. That being said, Applebee's is pretty good for a chain in my personal experiences. The menu is varied and the prices are reasonable/ cost effective. The several times I have eaten there over the years the service has always been good as far as customer service, My friend she had the steak which was my only complaint tonight. Had no flavor and was kind of tough like a reptiles skin lol. Other than that, I'd recommend Applebee's as a nice place to eat if you have your expectations for the level of reataurant it is.   This location in particular usually has a short at the most. The free Wifi is actually pretty good which is another plus. No issues streaming videos etc.. The 2 for $20.00 menu also has a decent selection for those on budget.  I like the amount of food served with the entrees which is just the right portions so no leftovers to take home. And the prices overall are alright too. This is sort of a bland review but what else do you want its Applebee's nothing to see here so keep it moving lol.  Bottomline good spot for drinks and average food at cost friendly pricing. So of the food will surprise you in a good way though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
8,Antique R.,"Passaic, NJ",2,22,4.0,2.0,2017-02-18,The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because the siracha shrimp was tasty. Other than that I would be giving them only one star.  The service was awful the waiter only came to take our order after that we never saw him again. I'm still waiting on my son refill to his drink a year later.  It was just awful on this particular night I'm never returning here again ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

13,Patrick J.,"Garfield, NJ",172,2,,1.0,2017-02-23,"I wish I could've left a a less than one star review. Never received such disrespect from the bartender (Tabby) in my life. When I asked to speak to the manager she asked me not to speak to her "" like that"". She refused to accept my friends international license and refused to serve us. I thought restaurants were supposed to put their customers first, I guess that's why tabby works at Applebee's because she's too incompetent to work anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and go to TGI Fridays, dont come here. I will never come back again in my life",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

Our waitress Sasha, was very helpful, courteous and friendly.

Big mistake should have taken it as a lose and gone some where else. I dont know where to start food was ice cold now its burned and dried up and tasteless. I guess doesnt care making dinner they feel they needed to make cold. It was better the first time. Dont come here. Go to hackensack.

2,Brittney M.,"Dumont, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-05,"This is the worse service I have ever experienced. 1. No one came too our table the whole 30mins we were sitting there until we told a manager. 2. We ordered apps and only got 1 plate for 2 people??? Didn't bring or offer water to the table. So we had to ask then she brought us water with NO straws. We ordered margaritas after they brought us our apps and NEVER brought them out. We had to wait another 30mins and ask her where they were. HORRIBLE. I will never be going there again. Not to mention when we finally did get the margaritas, they were absolutely disgusting. I will definitely be going to Hackensack or Clifton next time where they know how to provide quality service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garfield,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

So I decided to order Carside to go .Let me start by saying when I decided to order them it started to snow so I thought I would have to wait forever .
