15,Anthony L.,"Falls Church, VA",584,214,153.0,4.0,2014-08-16,Applebee's has a good 550 calories and below menu.  Located in a good area close to hwy 42.  Always got drink specials,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
14,Lauren B.,"Campbell, CA",1,23,4.0,1.0,2014-12-26,"Poor Service. We waited over 40mins for 3 salads, 2 sandwiches, soup, and mac&cheese. The server, Michelle W. brought one salad out 6mins before the rest of the food (the salad was an entree) she slung the salad down and as she walked away said ""the rest will be out in about 5mins."" 5MINS...WTH, we've already been waiting and why did you bring out an entree already? At this point we called the sloppy manager over and asked what was the status of our food. Of course that got is nowhere. The food eventually trickled out...and my dads fries where cold, my moms soup was cold, our Mac & Cheese was room temp. We had to slurp on our empty drinks. The bread that came with our meals came out with the final bill. This place was a joke. Shoulda known better choosing an Applebee's...this was defiantly a CrappleBee's. We will never return an you shouldn't either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
12,Annabelle L.,"Raleigh, NC",13,54,41.0,1.0,2015-08-01,Where to begin. I just can't. Service was awful.  I think we were in there so long that I had a birthday. Struck from the list.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
16,Richard B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,29,1.0,3.0,2015-08-22,"Applebees what can you say, it is what it is. Never felt really welcome there, kind of just another person sitting at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
13,Gigi G.,"Rolesville, NC",217,57,15.0,1.0,2016-03-20,"Sitting here and it took 30 minutes just to get drinks. Our pierced up waitress proceeds to get rude and say that we are just going to have to deal with the fact they are short staffed as she puts drinks down and we had to grab the ones we ordered. I can't imagine how long the food will take. I asked why isn't the manager helping and she said they were short a manager and the only one they had was cooking. This place is terrible. I can't imagine this place will remain open under this treatment, or lack there of. I even tried calling to get someone on the phone while we were sitting here and no one answered. What a joke. Hope this helps people in the future who want to actually get drinks and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
11,Nikolai M.,"Willow Spring, NC",0,36,,2.0,2016-06-26,"There's a certain sadness to eating at applebees. I do it like once every 3 years. They're always in the midst of some menu change, but its always the same crap. Burgers are usually overdone, pasta dishes are largely flavorless. All that is true of this particular applebees. Also my girlfriend ordered the oriental salad and they brought out the asian salad. Oops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
3,Cindy G.,"Apex, NC",145,518,2698.0,3.0,2016-08-15,Stopped by here to see some of the Olympics on our drive home. The staff was very accomodating changing channels for us. Server was attentive and looked up a salad dressing for us in the allergy brochure. Food came out fast. The fiesta line chicken was flavorful. Boneless wings were good too. I like the 2 for $20 deal. Restaurant was clean but bathrooms could've been cleaner.  Be careful touching the screen on the table tablet offering games. We were charged $2 and didn't play any games.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
9,Donna B.,"Raleigh, NC",30,22,3.0,2.0,2016-12-13,"I will not be coming back to this Applebee's for a very long time. In the past two years we've seen three different managers. Tonight was the worst. When we walked in the wait staff was sitting at a round table in the bar area playing around and having a good time. After being seeded, it took a long time before we were acknowledged by our waitress. The food was substandard, the service was terrible, and when we spoke to the manager on duty he made excuses. I think it's just a matter of time before this Applebee's goes out of business or completely fails. They hardly ever have any business, and when they do they don't have enough wait staff on the clock to handle what little bit of business they do get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
8,Edward S.,"Clayton, NC",3,13,,3.0,2017-02-19,We haven't been to an Applebee's in a long time. Food is OK wait staff is very good. I had a problem with the soup. At $4.50 for a bowl of soup I expect it to look like the picture a full bowl. When it was presented to me it was about a 1/4 bowl so I sent it back asked to speak to the manager. She was very indifferent about the presentation. A really poor attitude. As much as to say I'll tack it back and take it off your bill but if you don't like it you really don't need to come here. So I won't,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
10,Yesi M.,"Garner, NC",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-06,If I could give this place a negative star I would definitely do so. My family and I visited this place for the first time back on February for my birthday we got there looking forward to a nice dinner.  Once we got seated we waited for 15 minutes and I decided to get a waitress to even ask us what we wanted to drink. Once we ordered our drinks we were already ready to order our food. I ordered the pick two steak and the pasta with the wings as an appetizer. 30 minutes past and no signs of appetizer I went and got our server for the second time and asked where our food was and immediately brought it out(Cold) along with our Cold food... when I called to complain I spoke to the NEW GENERAL MANAGER. He promised us a $40 gift card for any Applebee's two weeks past and nothing arrived in the mail so I decided to give them a call again spoke to the same General manager and he said he will contact corporate to resend it.. it's now April and I'm still waiting... WORST FOOD...WORST SERVICE... VERY UNPROFESSIONAL... DONT GO WAIST MONEY HERE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
7,Christopher P.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",18,13,,1.0,2017-04-23,Out of every Applebee's I been too this one sucks the food is not good .. the one in fuquay varina nc is a lot better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
5,Andrew C.,"Willow Spring, Pleasant Grove, NC",32,1,,1.0,2017-07-23,We a group of 3 waited a hour for our food. I did a check in on facebook and within minutes the manager came over and apologized and even said they would pick up the check. After seeing some more people that came in AFTER the manager came over and they got their food and were eating we said fuck it and left....yes 30 minutes AFTER the manager came over. Unfortunately for me this was the SECOND time this bullshit happened to us. I did get an outreach because of another facebook check in but I never said anything back. We WILL NEVER BE BACK AGAIN. I don't have time for their bullshit. They don't deserve the ONE STAR at all !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
6,Chris C.,"Delaware, OH",1,30,1.0,4.0,2017-08-01,"Let's face it, Applebees is Applebees.  You don't go to a chain expecting to be wowed.  Honestly we don't go here very often.  However I have never been disappointed.  What sets a franchise apart is it's employees.  The food at this location is average to above average.  Generally comes out hot and when you would expect.  The service though, is actually quite good. We usually sit in the bar area so can't speak of table service in the dining room.  Lisa is an awesome bartender/server having been taken care of a couple timers by her.  She is very attentive and my wife states she makes the best daiquiri in JoCo.  They all seem to wrk together as a team pretty well as someone is always stopping by to clear dishes or refill drinks.  So what the heck, give it a try. These guys seems to hustle and try to give good service.  Who knows, you might be pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
4,Billy J.,"Garner, NC",54,11,,1.0,2017-10-01,"Had a curbside pick up order, Was told my food would be done by 6:09 got there at 6:13 did not get my food until 6:30!!! Though maybe it took that long to cook it, NO it sat there and got cold until some one finally brought it outside to me. The portions were much smaller than they should be and I ordered a burger with a little pink and they gave me one pretty much all pink!!! I paid $67 dollar for this meal and can't eat it I am to pissed. To say sorry they offered me another meal!!!!!! Yea probably not!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
0,Vickie B.,"Four Oaks, NC",62,3,12.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"This location has had quite a bit of turnover in staff.  Because it's local, I've been there about a dozen times in the past 6 months.  It's definitely a hit or miss experience.  The drinks are fairly consistent, though what you see online or on the menu, doesn't always look like what's served.   They used to have amazing Appletini's (going back about a year) the 2 that I ordered recently were pale in comparison.  The Bahama Mama was great, although served in different glass than pictured online.  (See photos).  We did order them specifically requesting less  Malibu Coconut and more crème de banana liqueur - as otherwise the coconut is a bit overwhelming.   The bartender complied, though our server had to return to us to inquire again which we wanted more and less of.   She only had 3 tables the entire time we were there, so it shouldn't have been complicated.  We ordered the fish & chips and fiesta chicken....the latter was fine, but the fish and chips were dropped off without tartar sauce, lemon or malt vinegar.   By the time we could flag down our server, my sister had already made a dent in her entree and mine was getting cold, so I began with it plain - when she returned with tartar sauce in a small ramekin, I didn't even bother to complain.   The fish and chips were fine, just lacking condiments which would have made them much better.   On other visits this location never failed to be consistent with unrolling napkins to find smeared silverware and needing to request replacements.   One time the replacements were worse than our originals, so our server apologized and went to kitchen and brought out freshly washed - clean - utensils.  SMH - how hard is it to check silverware before you wrap it?   Another recent visit left me sitting through half my sisters dinner while mine was being made because it had been delivered to the wrong table.   The manager came by and apologized, offering  us a free desert...we declined as we don't normally eat dessert and she shrugged and took off.   Really?   Customers who stop in several times a month and you can't take a  couple beverages off the total when your staff messes up?   No wonder there's a staff turnover.    Too bad there's not that much in the area that's good to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
2,Dylan H.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",32,68,6.0,4.0,2017-11-27,Forgot to post this review after I went but here we go.  I went with my dad out to eat while I was visiting last week.  I grew up around and had been a few times.   It's still good and I enjoyed my burger and beer.    Can't complain about it.   Service was also solid so no complaints.   Great place to enjoy a nice quiet night out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
1,Andrew C.,"Hastings, NE",26,7,,2.0,2018-01-09,"The food is usually very good, but the service gets VERY slow once the restaurant gets more than half full. They definitely need to hire more servers and cooks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-garner-4,,,,,
