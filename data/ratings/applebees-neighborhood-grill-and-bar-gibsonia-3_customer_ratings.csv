8,Sara C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,77,1.0,1.0,2012-04-02,"Typically Applebees is a safe, generic choice for a simple meal when you're hungry.  Their brand of American food can be a nice filler when food quality and taste are only secondary to your hunger.  I'd say that for lack of a truly tasty meal, the one redeeming quality is (usually) the service.  However, this was definitely not the case for the Gibsonia store.   Upon arriving we were greeted in a friendly manner by two lovely hostesses who showed us to our table and gave us our menus.  It pretty much all went downhill from there.  After a few minutes, our waiter came by and without introducing himself, asked us what we'd like to drink.  He looked confused and his speech sounded as if he were mumbling, but we thought nothing of it.  He quickly brought us our drinks and we placed our orders which consisted of two salads and two appetizers we were going to share as our meal.  The one thing we did ask was that the salads be brought out at the same time as the rest of our food (which is not usually a problem.).  Several minutes later, one of the food runners brought us one salad.  When we informed her that we had in fact ordered two salads to be brought with our food, she went back to let the waiter know about his error.  Minutes and minutes passed  by and eventually we were brought salad #2 (still no food by the way.)    Several more minutes passed by and I was starting to suspect that our waiter  wasn't just confused or uncomfortable - he was high!   The guy was slurring his speech and was so glassy eyed that he couldn't even focus.  He alternated staring at his notebook and the computer screens for well over 10 minutes as if he were trying to decipher some ancient hieroglyphics.  Finally, after I'd had enough I summoned a manager to our table and explained to him that there was something wrong with his waiter.  I told him about or food situation and the fact that over 1/2 an hour had passed with no sign of our two appetizers.  The manager half-hardheartedly apologized and made an excuse that his waiter had an ear infection, was being sent home and promised our food would be right out.  Fifteen minutes later, the waiter was STILL standing at the computer looking confused and we STILL had no food.   After almost an hour of dealing with wretched service, we finally decided enough was enough and left.   Wendy's was pretty good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
6,Jenny C.,"Gibsonia, PA",62,100,22.0,4.0,2014-01-31,"Overall, I'm pleased with this location.  The staff is friendly and aims to please.  They have take out service and you can call ahead to make a reservation no matter how many (or little) people you have so you don't have to wait in line!  The food is good and they make every attempt to meet your needs and or dietary requirements.  My only complaint is the placement of the tables.  I always try to get a booth because the tables are placed very close to each other and you usually end up bumping chairs with the person behind you.  Other than that, Applebees's is a great place to go both for food or drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
7,Marshall S.,"Allison Park, PA",1,6,3.0,4.0,2014-02-04,"We go to this Applebee's all the time! This is like a regular family hangout for us. My kids love the place, and we always try to get Vanessa to wait on us if she's available - she's absolutely the best! Great place to go for good food with the family! I also really like the new items on their menu - and Applebee's keeps on coming up with new items!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
10,T B.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,19,,1.0,2014-09-04,"Me, wife and daughter out to eat at Applebees in Gibsonia. Usually have ok meals and good service. Not this night. Ordered 9oz sirloin medium rare. came back medium well, sent it back at the servers insistence and I watched while my wife and daughter ate their dinners. 20 minutes later my food arrived again, steak tasted odd, like it was spoiled and still not even cooked right. Sides were not redone either, they just stuck the potato and broccoli under the lamp. soggy, disgusting, inedible food. could not eat  it at all. The manager came over and offered us nothing but to remove that one meal from the check. ridiculous. I wrote to the company,  and the manager, Mark called me and we discussed it. He sent me 2 $10 gift cards to 'entice' me back. I sent them back to him telling him that this was insulting. they cannot cook, service was good, but the manager and other manager were incompetent, patronizing,  and almost offensive for what they offered us. My wife and daughter's meals were just OK, not great. They dropped the ball and will never have us or anyone I talk to as customers ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
5,Peter K.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,4,2.0,4.0,2015-02-06,"My wife and I like this location.It was recently updated, the staff is friendly, the food is good, the menu is often refreshed. My favorite dish is out of season right now but it is the margareta chicken with shrimp and avacodos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
4,Brittany O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,6,,3.0,2015-11-17,"Always go to Applebee's for the good specials at home in Minnesota, so it was highly disappointing to visit this location. We waited for happy hour which I thought to restaurants meant good deals for their consumers on normally sized items, but to this location or maybe all Pennsylvania locations happy hour only means prorated meals for a prorated over price. Well that's not why I came to Applebee's for happy hour. It is however the reason I will not return. I didn't bother complaining to management because I don't want a gift card to come back. That what I was trying to use up. A gift card. Thanks. Don't worry, I didn't stiff your waitress either, she tried. And I never went to a place with trivia where you had to pay to play?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
3,Dan C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,23,,2.0,2016-01-21,"The service was OK.  I went here with a work group during lunch and the only thing on the menu I could eat was fries and onion rings.  They have no meatless and/or dairy free entrees.   I had the ""once frozen"" onion rings and a water and had to stop some where on the way back to work to get some lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
2,Kara S.,"Atlanta, GA",114,18,,1.0,2016-10-14,"Happy hour was not that great! They substituted club soda for sour mix. Ruined the drinks and thank goodness we had an amazing server!! Joel wanted to go above and beyond for us!! Food was not great either...disappointing compared to the Applebee's on Lebanon Church Road. Thought happy hour would have been a good idea, not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
0,Gabby M.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,4,,4.0,2016-12-10,Applebee's is an outstanding restaurant.  I go a lot of the time and I have not had one bad experience yet. I usually get one of the Neighborhood  burgers. They are very high-quality and cooked and seasoned  well. I would really recommend Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
1,Kelly N.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,7,1.0,2.0,2017-10-28,They overlooked my burger when I asked for pink twice. Then manager was rude and I waited an hour for my meal when there was only 10 people max. So frustrated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gibsonia-3,,,,,
