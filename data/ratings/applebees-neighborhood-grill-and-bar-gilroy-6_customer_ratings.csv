It's not because the food was bad, it was ok a bit better than average. However the service was appalling. I've been to many places and luckily although not frequent when a server messes up they apologize and offer something on the house. Here? No chance. Hardly an apology for spilling a whole glass of water over my wife and myself. And no, this soda is on me etc. Other places do this as a matter of course but this place failed. To me it's accepted practice and common decency. Lucky it was not soda or anything stronger because that would have been a real smack in the face. Even service after this (water spill at the start) was patchy at best. The spinach and artichoke dip was good but really after that initial disaster it's hard to rate this place above 1 star even if it served world class food which it doesn't at all!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=160,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.7640000000000002,2.28

However, there were 3 charges that we did not make before we discovered the card missing. Fortunately AMEX said that they would turn the matter over to their fraud investigator and we would not be held responsible for the unauthorized charges.

The service here was ok, but there was an incident with two waitresses that had a little fight, kind of unprofessional...Made it a bit awkward, but our waitress was very sweet still. We ordered the two entrees and one appetizer meal for $20. The appetizer that we ordered is honey BBQ wings which was good! I love that it had a crisp to it due to the honey! The entree that I ordered was a seven ounce steak that was over cooked and not tender. The mashed potatoes tasted good and the vegetables were very soggy. The other entree was a chicken and shrimp dish that was on a skillet. The chicken was plain but very juicy. The shrimp was a bit too salty for me and whatever that green sauce was on top...didn't mix with the flavor.

253,Tamara J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",4,36,1.0,5.0,2012-04-08,"I'll admit, we've been to this Applebees before and it was never anything special- just mediocre food and service.  However, our recent visit was enough to make us look forward to returning again soon.  This review is based on the fact that good service goes a long, long way.  My husband and I sat at the bar for lunch and drinks after a morning of shopping at the outlets.  One of the bartenders, Monica, took care of our food and drinks.  Monica has one of those special personalities that kept the people there at the bar ordering more appetizers, food and drinks than they probably would have otherwise.  She gave attention to each customer with a big, bright smile and friendly service.  My husband had the appetizer sampler and I had the soup (delicious!!!).  We hardly had any wait at all for our food even though the place was packed for lunch.  Our drinks were top notch (I had the skinny mojito- Monica even checked to see that I was enjoying it!).  I ordered a second juts because she was so great.  If you go for happy hour (great deals on certain drinks and half off most appetizers!), you should look for Monica.  She will make it worth the stop!  She is someone who obviously enjoys her job and does it well.  Thanks, Monica!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=240,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.036,2.52
246,Sophia B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,1,,4.0,2012-04-11,"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere here, like any other restaurant in a small town with nothing to do or nowhere to go, If you want a more quiet meal, come during the day, if your looking for a hang out spot to drink, eat cheap appetizers, and meet up with half of Gilroy, then come at happy hour. People complain so much about bad service and food being half assed. Remember that some of these people come to work right after leaving their second job, to only go to another job after clocking out at apple bees. Ive had many good experiences here and for the most part see the staff doing their best while still enjoying their jobs. Its a hard business serving hundreds a day, and maybe thousands a week. Especially in this location i give them props. Might i add if you do happen to go in and you see monica at the bar, i urge you to swipe a seat at the bar. She should be named one of the top bartenders in Gilroy, not because drinks are fabulous seeing as it is a corporation, but her demeanor and personality make the experience worth it. Great job Monica and i will always look forward to seeing you. As for all the people that complain of the service... DONT go back, i know way too many people that go back even after they post ridiculously mean things on here. So to everyone in the food industry.

""Gosh Chi, we haven't been here in ages."" ""I know, let's see if it's any better than some of the reviews we read."" Chi orders a beer.  It has no head, is not really cold, and is not filled to the rim - because of the missing head.  He takes a sip. ""What the...I think this beer has been sitting at the bar for a while.  I'm going to get a new one."" ""Don't make a scene,"" Kim pleads.  Chi walks to the bar and a server nearby (not Chi's server) asks if he can help.  Chi explains his beer situation to him. ""Well, I can't believe we would serve it that way,"" exclaims the server.  Chi stands there for a minute with his mouth open, wondering if that was a feeble attempt at an apology on behalf of the restaurant or an indictment of Chi's honesty. ""Don't care if you believe it or not; that's how my beer came.""  Crap, Kim won't be happy with that, Chi thinks.  She said not to make a scene.  The server kind of shakes his head incredulously.  Therefore, Chi feels obligated to  give him the ""stink eye.""  Mercifully, the bartender comes over and Chi gives him the same story.  He pours Chi another beer, cold, with a head...exactly how he expected it in the first place.  Problem solved. ""Thanks, man, that looks perfect,"" Chi says.  As he walks back to his table, Chi raises his glass to the dumb-ass server still lingering about. Dinner comes.  Kim order penne and grilled chicken in alfredo sauce.  The meal was rather dry...hardly any sauce. ""How's your pasta, Kim,"" Chi asks. ""Eh, I ordered this because I like alfredo sauce...wish it had some."" ""Sorry,"" Chi says.  ""Guess the reviews for here aren't far off.""

181,Nancy C.,"San Francisco, CA",39,36,7.0,4.0,2013-01-15,"This was my first time at Applebee's, mostly because I tend to gravitate towards food places/restaurants that aren't chains (except for McDonald's and Burger King). Also, I saw an ad for Applebee's the night before, talking about their $9.99 specials or whatever, so I was intrigued.  So, I came here on Sunday with two other people. We were seated at a booth by this one girl standing at the entrance. She gave us our menus and we deliberated for a long time since their $9.99 deal or whatever it is (it's like one entree with some other things for a certain price that's offered everyday except for Sunday) wasn't offered that day. We ultimately decided on getting the two entree and appetizer for only $20. Now, the menu is kind of tricky because it says 2 entrees for $20. I asked our server - I'm pretty sure her name is Cyndi - if appetizers were included in that $20 and she said yes. Obviously, I was all excited because the portions, judging from others' tables, looked huge and the options available seemed delicious. We ordered BBQ chicken nugget things which came with celery and ranch, and our two entrees were: Oriental Chicken Salad and Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine. I also asked for three plates since we were sharing. Our server asked us if we wanted everything at once and we said yes. We ordered waters (drinks aren't included in this $20 deal thing), and waited for our food to come. This place has really great decor. I'm a huge fan of old vintage novelties and just sitting there was great. Anyways, our food came after about ten minutes and the three of us finished the entrees and appetizer after 45 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken nugget things were sooooo good. There were actually quite a lot of pieces for an appetizer and it was seasoned nicely and the flavor was great. There's nothing else to really say about this since they were just good. The Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine was slightly spicy, but came with an abundance of shrimp. The noodles were covered in a creamy white sauce that was slightly saltier than it should have been. But with the shrimp and some beans and corn included in it, the dish was more spicy than salty. The flavor was good, especially since I'm a fan of spicy food. The Oriental Chicken Salad was alright. I'm not a fan of sweet dressing, which well, it was. The lettuce and stuff seemed to be taken out of one of those salad kits you get at Costco - it was shredded and seemed pre-packaged. However, the grilled chicken (we got a choice between fried or grilled) was super good. It wasn't tough; it was tender, there was a lot of it, and it was filling. There were also little fried noodles in it, which, I suppose, makes it ""oriental."" Gosh, they should really change the name of this dish... But that's besides the point. Our server came back again and gave us the check after we asked. We paid and then she came back with our change. I didn't notice it until after we paid, but there was a small hand-written note on top of the receipt that said ""Thank you! =)"" with a hand-drawn heart and I think the person's name was Angie. .... Our server was probably Angie then? Or Cyndi? I don't really know, but whoever it was, it was a nice personal touch!  Anyway, our total came out to be $21 and some cents. For three dishes - since the appetizer came with so much chicken it basically counted as a freaking entree - for $21, it was a steal! And with great service - food came quickly, server was nice and attentive, that personal note on the receipt, and having our server actually say bye to us as we left - this was a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=140,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.0,2.2

158,Renato M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,14,1.0,1.0,2013-08-22,"One of the worst Applebee's' experience that I've had.. To sum up: Terrible service Average food No bathroom Bathroom: The staff said their bathroom is under construction and there was a white bathroom outside (that looked like a container or a huge generator from the outside of it).. I get that at least it is something and that they would be worst off without nothing, but it did made our experience at the restaurant worse.. Service: Went there with my mom after some shopping. We were greeted at the front and they didn't get my mom's name correct... Her name is common and my guess is that they didn't really pay attention and didn't want to ask again. We were seated after maybe 5 minutes (was about 2pm) and I think they forgot about us at that moment. No water or anything was brought to us... We waited for 15 minutes easily before I stood up and energetically waved both my arms to get a waiter's attention.  Btw, do not expect that any waiter, other than the one serving you,  will care about you. 2 other waiters were looking directly at me during this 15 min period and they did notice me calling them (you can tell because they focus their eyes at you) only to look away... (I swear I could listen to one of them saying in his mind ""not my problem"" and walking away) Food: Finally we ordered and 5 minutes latter comes our waiter saying that they were out of some ingredients from the side dish from the orange chicken that my mom ordered, and if they could replace them with something else (I'm fine with that). Then because of the delay on my mom's food, my plate arrives early (not the best practice.. But ok...) And after some more time then her orange chicken finally arrives... And it tastes awful. Tasted like a poorly made chicken nugget with some orange seasoning on top.. She then asked to trade it for a ceasar salad wich was ok. Next time I am at the outlet I will consider other options and even McD. before this applebees again. Positive: To close this review with a positive note (and to make it worth one star instead of zero) the manager later did go over our table and apologized for the delay and for the bad chicken.

We ordered: Perfect patron margarita: patron silver 100% agave tequila and patron citronge with perfect margarita mix ($9.75) - Came with a shaker of the extra margarita. A huge serving but very weak. There wasn't much alcohol in it. House salad (no croutons) with ranch ($3.25) - Average house salad with mixed greens, tomatoes and cheese. The greens were crisp and fresh. I enjoyed the salad.  9oz house sirloin: classic steakhouse cut, served with seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes ($15.49) - This was the roommate's dish. It looked fine, but kind of bland. He seemed to enjoy it as long as he had some A1. Appetizer sampler: Mozzarella sticks, Spinach & artichoke dip, Cheese quesadilla grande, Boneless buffalo wings ($12.99) - I'm a variety kind of girl so I thought this would be good for me. Unfortunately the Mozzarella sticks weren't hot and gooey and the Spanish & artichoke dip needed seasoning. I had to add salt to it to eat it. The Boneless buffalo wings were okay when dipped in ranch. And the Cheese quesadilla grande tasted fine with the salsa.  Butter pecan blondie: baked with nuts, topped with ice cream and glazed pecans covered with a rich, cream cheese sauce ($5.49) - Apparently the roommate orders this every time he goes to Applebee's.

I asked for a soup container but he said he could bring the plate to the back and box it up himself. He was a little insistent so I said fine. Some time passes and he comes back saying someone dropped the plate and we're making us a new one to go.

Bartender not wearing a name tag did not greet me just said what'll you have? I responded with a jack and diet in a pint glass. He was walking away as I said what I wanted and in the 4 feet from me in the bar turned to make the drink and did not remember half of the order. That's right he did not remember diet coke and he put it in a rocks glass. When he brought it back I said hey let's start this again. I would like a jack and diet coke in a pint glass. He repeated me and now I have been sitting here for 18 minutes and he has not come to ask me anything.

97,Timo L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,,1.0,2015-12-30,"Ug. Geez. Ok.  I get it.   I had medium expectations too, but didn't expect this:  You may have been on the road (I-5) for hours, or spent the day elbowing your way through the not so great deal Outlet Malls, and you are tired, and hungry.  So you think to yourself- ""Let's just go to Applebees- can't be that bad- it's supposed to be a step above...ie. Chili's etc."" FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY.  STOP AND THINK FOR JUST A MOMENT! Do yourself a favor- go over to In-n-Out again, or Mc Donalds, or even the Hot dog stand at the Home Depot (great guy and a local secret favorite by the way). BUT AVOID THIS STICKY, SMELLY, HONEY BOO-BOO DATE NIGHT DESTINATION OF INDIGESTION AT ANY COST! Really.  I wish I could say otherwise, but as one of the busiest Applebees in the country you would think that they would: 1: Understand that it smells like a shuttered up zookeepers shower room in Orlando in August. 2: Understand that occasionally wiping the last 30 diners sputum off the table with actual cleanser is a positive thing. 3: Wilted, soggy, cold, unseasoned greens placed in a jumble with boiled until deceased (and likewise completely unseasoned) new potatoes holding hands with what could only be described as a cadaverous excuse for poor Flossy the milk cow's tumerous beef growth is not a steak dinner. 4. Mac and Cheese, covered with dried chicken (I hope) tenders, and then drenched with a brown embalming fluid is not  American, comfort food, or even possibly legal in some states. 5. Artichoke what?  on Salmon?  Wha?  Ew.  Wilted, wet and uncomfortable once again. 6. There are beers that you say you have but you don't because they are only in some restaurants but not this one? But they are on the friggin menu but your server can't get them for you 'cause whatever 'cause whatever 'cause well to hell with it.  (Try some alcohol in your mixed drinks too, if you can afford to put another lump of coal on the fire Uncle Scrooggelebee.) I could go on, but won't.  I think you get it. Recommendations to Applebees parent company or otherwise: 1.  Every single night clean the **** out of this place.  Stem to Stern. Figure out with cadaver dogs or otherwise where that smell is coming from. (Carpet, chairs and tables probably in that order Mr. Manager.) 2.  Send your head chef ( the guy who makes up dishes such as the aforementioned wouldn't serve it to Gitmo prisoners Mac -n-Cheese) well..... to Gitmo (before it closes down or just leave them there.) Good grief- everything was just awful- even to look at.   3.  Retrain the entire staff- they probably thought one of the perks of working there was eating for free...I feel so sorry for them. Please give them meaning in life by allowing them to serve decent, non-hybridized, over reaching, godawful attempts at some sort of American cuisine.  Tone it down in the kitchen.  just make it good.  Simple. Tasty.  Your customers are the tired and newly poor (Outlet Malls again) and need to treated as such.  Not given literally what could be their last meal before they contact some incurable virus from the environs and cross the dark divide.  4. Remember what it means to be in charge of what was once one of the most sought after restaurant chains for groups such as the Ladies Auxiliary retirement club, or the speed dater's anonymous Wednesday group, or the Holiday Inn Express next door go to place.  C'mon people, you were great once.  ( I think) ( I heard it somewhere).  This isn't complicated.  Throw on some clean socks, slick back your hair, hike up you khakis, and make Gilroy's Applebees the apple of your eye!  Imagine how it will look on your restaurant improvement resume when you attend the managers convention for DineEquity in BEEEAUTIful Gelndale California.  Yea!

We think our waitress must have been covering two sections because she would take quite a while before she would come back to us. The place was hot inside and out table felt sticky. I ordered a salmon, my wife a steak w/fries, our 18 m/o a corn dog , and our 5 y/o a mac n cheese plate.  My wife's steak was chewy and flavorless.  And our toddler's corn dog was under cooked because when my wife was cutting it in smaller pieces the batter of the corn meal was still raw.  Wife sent it back to get a new one cooked all the way through. The second one they brought out was again undercooked. Finally we talked to the manager about it and explained to him why it's dangerous to be serving undercooked food especially when people bring their kids to their restaurant. They took the corndog off of our bill and we just fed her broccoli and French fries. Overall the dinner experience was bad and this Applebee's is one of the worst ones I've been to.

When we went the room was packed, so we waited around 20-30 minutes for seating which was fine. It was warm outside and the indoors was somewhat cool. We got seated by our server, Amanda. She did the best she could and I don't blame her for anything. She was great! I decided to order the new Fire Roasted Chicken Salad Wrap with a Cesar Salad for the lunch combo. I had high expectations because it mentioned it being spicy. Knowing myself, I LOVE SPICY. My mom was about to get that but was worried it was going to be too spicy, so she asked what was in it that gave it heat. Amanda replied that it was mixed with sriracha (which in my opinion is not even spicy at all).  We wait a bit then receive our food. Everyone's portions seemed a lot larger than mine. The salad seemed small and it looked like I was missing half of my wrap. The plate landing on the table made me feel incomplete because my food looked incomplete. After some disappointment, I began to eat. I wanted a lot more dressing on my salad, but aside from that it was fine. More croutons could have helped but that's just me loving bread. The wrap however looked dinky. Half a wrap. It was a mere 3-4 inches long. It looked promising because of the amount of chicken and lettuce it held. One bite in, no spice. There was a lot of healthy flavors going on, but as I continued I was wondering where the spice was. There was no heat at all. I wasn't dying for water or sweating. It was nice, but could have been better with the some sort of spiciness.  Overall my portion size could have been more and things could have had more flavors. I would say I'd go here again but I'm not: 1) Because Gilroy is far away from me 2) Because the food was not up to my expectation and I could have been more full if I spent my money elsewhere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6,2.0,2.38,2.38,2.056,2.2279999999999998
