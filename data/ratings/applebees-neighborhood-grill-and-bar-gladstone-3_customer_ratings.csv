14,DJuan L.,"Kansas City, MO",133,331,1216.0,2.0,2012-11-04,"I usually go to this Applebees because it is the closest one to me. I only sit at the bar when I'm here because I'm usually just there to grab a drink and watch a game. The manager and bartenders are always nice and don't mind striking up a friendly conversation. I haven't had an issue w/ the Applebees until my last visit. The last time I went to this particular location I saw a roach crawling around about the shelves where the liquor is stored. At first I tried to ignore it but then I thought ""what if they have roaches in the back by the food or crawling on the plates and glasses. I'm not too comfortable w/ eating there again after seeing that but I may still be willing to catch the game and maybe have a beer (in a bottle of course).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
23,Nathan C.,"Omaha, NE",3,6,1.0,1.0,2013-10-28,"Horrible, my baby back ribs had a quarter inch of char on them, wrong flavor , waitress was supposed to go get the manager who never came, paid left no tip , never going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3?start=20,,,,,
11,Chris S.,"Kansas City, MO",0,3,,1.0,2014-12-31,"I just signed up for Yelp to make this review. That's how irritated I am. I'm writing this while waiting in the parking lot. I put in an online order. I received an email, saying it would be ready at 7:50. I got here at exactly 7:40, but the car side parking spots were taken, so I waited for one to open. One became available at 7:46. Not a single employee came outside until 8:10. That's 24 minutes I waited just for someone to come outside. She finally came and got my name and my money. It's now 8:26, and she just came back out to tell me, ""We're just finishing up your food right now."" Oh god news. She just brought my food. It's 8:31. I will never again come to this place. Ever. Edit: looks like I was wrong. I had to come back to return THE WRONG FOOD. Don't get me wrong, I can understand mistaking a red 350Z for a white van, but I feel like with the hour they had, they could have discerned the difference. So here I sit at the bar while they remake my food. It's 9:08. I may just starve to death before I get the correct food from this place. The 1 star is for the manager. Pleasant guy, considering there are three other people waiting here with similar complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
21,Krisna G.,"Kansas City, MO",0,4,7.0,1.0,2015-03-01,This used to be our Friday night out restaurant until about a year ago. The music is so loud you can't have a conversation with the person in front of you. The prices went up and the food portions went down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3?start=20,,,,,
16,April R.,"Modesto, CA",3,25,25.0,1.0,2015-03-16,"Asked for the ""Oriental Chicken Wrap"" which is something they use to offer on their menu, which they now offer as a salad, literally just take the salad and put it inside of a tortilla and roll it up. Viola! Oriental chicken wrap... The server agrees to it and it gets sent back to the kitchen. 2 minutes later she, who by the way is great, says the kitchen says they can't do that... So they send out the salad and a tortilla and I made it myself. Then the server comes to me and says her manager MADE her apologize to me and the kitchen or else she'd lose her job!!! Really?! Fire your server for trying to please the customer??? The management here is the worst I've ever seen! Terrible... The server however, was super kind, we are our ""food"" tipped her $20 and split! Won't be back! Ever! I do however hope that our server also splits and finds a job somewhere where she is respected!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
19,Kristin D.,"Kansas City, MO",61,28,28.0,3.0,2015-03-23,The cedar grilled lemon chicken is really good. I would have enjoyed it more if the menu had warned me of the celery used in the green apple relish. I would have requested it with out the relish since this is an allergy for me. I found out too late as I bit into it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
20,Jane D.,"Kansas City, MO",0,1,,1.0,2015-03-29,"We've had curbside takeout twice here.    The edible food was pretty substandard (a horribly overcooked steak & dry leathery ckn breast).   Not actually edible to most, to be honest,  but the worst was the salads we added onto the meals.   Apparently for curbside they assume you won't bother to care that your salad was made with the slimey brown greens that should have been thrown away a few days ago.  Once would have been a fluke.   Twice makes me sure ill never eat at this nasty place again.   The slimey lettuce brought to mind actual slugs.   This is the kind of place that would puree said slugs & add it to the salad dressing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3?start=20,,,,,
22,Julia D.,"Gladstone, MO",0,25,4.0,1.0,2015-10-16,Sorry I came in.... Not 1 but 3 employees just ignored myself and another. 1 lied about being the bartender saying he'd be right with us. In fact he was just a bus boy.... Michelle the 'real' bartender talked to a couple with her back to the 2 of us the whole time. There are to many other choices in town to be ignored by those that don't do a good job. Regulars are there main priority.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3?start=20,,,,,
17,Aurora E.,"Kansas City, MO",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-21,Management is the worst I've ever seen here. The general manager I encountered a while back (who fingers crossed has been long since fired) was so unpleasant and incredibly rude I was not even prepared to respond to such behavior. Food is obviously microwaved. Might as well go to McDonald's--better quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
13,John L.,"Kansas City, MO",17,11,3.0,1.0,2015-12-12,"Came in early on a Sunday at around 4pm.Had my wife and two young children with me.Waited over 10 minutes just to get drinks!Wait staff is haphazard at best.Ordered a 7oz steak Medium Well,received one nearly raw..not rare..RAW!Cold and super bloody.Sat here for over 2 HOURS!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
15,Lloyd F.,"North Kansas City, MO",2,5,,1.0,2016-01-28,"This place blows. Bartenders are great and service at the bar is good. There are a few good servers that have been here for years, food is decent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
12,Tom S.,"Kansas City, MO",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-22,"very mediocre food, and not priced accordingly. too many other choices to patronize again. One tip to management - if you are going to serve small house salads - don't serve in a giant plate - they only look smaller!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
18,Nina D.,"Kansas City, MO",0,5,,1.0,2016-05-28,"Thought we would try once more in hopes new owners would improve. They haven't. However, I now can finish the Quesadilla Burger because the hamburger is now half the size it used to be. And the jalapeño dressing on the mexi salad is just plain awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
7,Jill D.,"Kansas City, MO",2,175,3.0,2.0,2016-05-30,"My friend and I are taking bets regarding the longevity of this Applebee's.  In other words, how long is it going to last.  Walked in and were seated at a small table that rocked only a little bit.  The pop music was loud even though the place was filled with older couples like us.  I'm guessing they play the music for the staff.   Our server took our order - 3-cheese pasta with chicken for my friend, and chicken strips with onion rings  for me.  Oh, wait...they were out of onion rings so I subbed BBQ seasoned fries.  Food arrived, but we had no utensils.  Server brought them and I replaced the buttermilk ranch???? sauce for the more traditional honey mustard sauce.  Food was hot - a plus - but it was also super salty.  Had one piece of chicken and about 10 fries before I had to give up.  Friend said his 3-cheese sauce tasted different, more watery and less flavor.  (sigh) Server came back and asked if I wanted to take food home.  No, it was way too salty for me.  She offered to get me something else, but I declined.  When she returned with the bill, her manager had taken off 20% which was very nice.  She did an OK job, so no complaints there. Probably won't go back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
10,Brent W.,"Kansas City, MO",2,136,8.0,4.0,2016-08-10,Overall I really like this place. Only four stars however though. My food was extremely good and the order came out as I requested. However some people in my party their food did not come out as to order. There drinking glass was also a little dirty.  But still giving four stars because I was pleased with the food and customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
3,Zubin C.,"Kansas City, MO",26,29,42.0,5.0,2016-08-12,It was great food our server Kat  was so very kind she made our meal a pleasent experence and we would come back again and again because of Kat  She is the best server we have ever had,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
9,Matthew E.,"Pinebluff, NC",190,69,11.0,1.0,2016-10-07,No words to describe how shitty this place is. Bad service and really bad food. Never will I come back here. Totally not worth the cash we spent. We saw a lot of employees just standing around doing NOTHING. We saw customers having to go get a waiter to take their order. Most had been sitting a long time and no service at all. This place should be shut down and buried alive. DO NOT SOEND YOUR MONEY HERE.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
6,Alicia S.,"Kansas City, MO",40,32,7.0,1.0,2016-12-04,Register hardly deserves one star but the margarita was great everything else not so much! I can't even tell you how long we had to wait for a server The place was so slow and we could not find a single waitress or anything to give us our drinks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
8,Ryan B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,26,,1.0,2016-12-19,My Triple Bacon Cheeseburger was a regular burger with no bacon and my wife's quesadilla tasted like it had been dipped in salt or washed in ocean water. I have given this place many chances but it is just bad. Some major changes need to be made as the other stores in the area are decent. I would give this place a hard pass for at least 6 months.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,

0,Kieu N.,"Kansas City, MO",169,128,618.0,3.0,2017-04-26,"After a handful of visits, this location is a solid 3 stars for me. I don't often visit chains, but this place seems to do it for my boyfriend. He likes their good deals - like on Mondays - you get a burger and beer for less than $10. For me, I go for well-priced drinks and bar appetizers. Their flavored margaritas and sangrias kick butt! I'm also a fan of the wonton chicken tacos. We always plop down at the bar near a tv, and our bartender always take great care of us. We never have to wait very long for food. All in all, this place met my expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
2,Ashlie V.,"Maple Park West, Kansas City, MO",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-04,"I've increasingly become more and more disappointed with this place. Over the years the food quality has declined while the prices have increased. We decided to go again recently to try their $1 Long Island Iced teas. We also ordered an appetizer. Service was slow, took a long time to get our food and it was not busy. But the worst thing was that we all got food poisoning, including my 11 month old baby. We were all sooo sick. That was the last straw. We will NEVER be going back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
1,Christopher M.,"Chicago, IL",3,3,,1.0,2017-12-10,"I ordered a car side to go order. They switched up orders and gave me someone else's food. I didn't realize it until I got home. I called them and they said bring the food back and they'll make the right order. Instead of making fresh food, they gave me the hour old cold food that the other person brought back. Shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gladstone-3,,,,,
