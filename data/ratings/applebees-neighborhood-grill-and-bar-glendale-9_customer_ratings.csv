What happened to customer service? The people working here are not very nice at all. After commenting on our servers attitude my husband told me that it was probably her last shift so she was entitled to act like that. I'm sorry I don't care if your pet died your at work and you shouldn't be as mean as our server was.  Even though the workers were completely horrible, the food was pretty good. The drinks were strong and the restaurant was clean. Another thing is that the service was quick.

I choose this location based on the fact it's on my way home from job #1 and job #2 is at Bayshore. I only come here to unwind after a stressful day: they have $2.99 tall ($1.99 regular) long islands all day every day. And, in my opinion, they are pretty amazing and always help cheer me up and/or relax. Service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome, other times it can be pretty bad. I only order food here if there's nothing at home and/or I feel like I'm starving to death. I've never had anything bad and I feel it always comes out rather quickly. I know it's all unhealthy, and most items contain more calories than I would consume in a typical day - or two. Except for the ""healthy"" items, and from what I have tried, those are all pretty lackluster. People watching can be pretty fun here. They also have lots of tvs to catch whatever game is on. Bottom line: Don't seek out Applebee's for unique or nutritious meals, or stellar service.

About 10 minutes later the two girls sitting next to us told us that they had to wait 20 minutes to get drinks, that it was the worst service they'd ever had, and that we should leave while we had the chance. Not being one to complain, I said we'd wait 5 more minutes, so we did... ...and nothing. No water, drinks, nothing.  After a full 15 minutes (not at ALL an exaggeration) we finally got up and left.

I had flavored lemonade for my beverage of choice, and it was supposed to be strawberry-lemon, but it mostly tasted like lemonade with pink in it. Strangely just like the mixed-berry lemonade I had for my second choice.  The food was no saving grace. I had the fried green beans with the dippin' sauces. They were fine. But I opted for one of their steak and shrimp options. the steak seemed to have been thawed from frozen. It came with a side of broccoli that was -smothered- with garlic and something else that had an off taste.  I suppose it's no secret that when going to Applebees, just go for apps, drinks, or lunch.

My son took his girlfriend to Applebees.  He said he had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. He said that the hamburgers he ordered were barely edible and were cold. He said that his waiter was unfriendly and acted like a robot and did not smile. Yes, this is a 2nd hand review but I have been to Applebees myself on a few rare occasions and can completely concur with what my son had told me.  While I did not have to wait quite that long for a table and my waiter was somewhat cordial, the food was cold and did not seem at all fresh. I knew then that this visit would be my last. The only reason my son went back was that he had a $25 gift card so in essence, his meal was free.

My wife said her's was barely edible, I had ordered a 2nd drink when the order arrived but it was sitting at the bar the whole time, I was done eating by the time the waitress brought it to me, the main issue is bad service, our food wasn't given to us in a reasonable time (the waitress was hanging out with the hostess counting her tips) the with my drink (lemonade) that I paid twice for was sitting at the bar and so was our waitress for close to 5 min talking with other workers, she got up and didn't grab my drink but went back for it about 10 min later (like I said I was done eating a steak by the time she got back). Overall this place is the worst in Milwaukee, I have dined at some iffy places in my life but this was bad all around, I couldn't find anything pos to say!

We arrived with a party of three and stated that the fourth was about 15 minutes behind. We were seated immediately (plenty of open booths), but no waiter to be found. After waiting 10 minutes without being so much as greeted by a server, we were rudely told by the hostess that we wouldn't be served until the fourth had arrived. Fine.  When the entire party had been seated, we ordered our drinks. About another twenty minutes later after sitting empty and alone, we were able to flag the server down for refills. We then put orders in for appetizers and waited another half hour with no contact. Appetizers arrived and the order (wings) was wrong. We were so hungry at this point we ate them anyway.  Less than five minutes after the appetizers arrived, the entrées did as well. But not all of them, just two of the four. One was completely wrong. The wrong entrée was taken back to be fixed, and we were left to sit for another 20 minutes, one entrée getting cold and three more M.I.A. A good 25 minutes later a second entree arrives, again wrong (incorrect rob sauce). Ten minutes after that, a third. Another ten minutes after that, the first incorrect order comes back.  Just a botched experience all around. Terrible service, unresponsive and absent management, mediocre food, empty dishes were not bussed at all throughout the meal, screwed up more orders than not.

It's looks nice.  I decided to give it a try again.   Went on 3-5-16 around 5 pm.  Parking: none.   Applebee's corporation really?   Why would I want to park my near the place.  Hostess I will call highlighter girl has a map of the restaurant a several highlighters.  The restaurant had been half full (maybe). No hello or greeting.   Highlighter girl takes the top off the yellow one and says restaurant or bar.  I respond which ever.  She puts the cap back on and said then go sit at the bar.  This restaurant has two areas and one appears to be a bar. With table around it and several TVs.  You may have seen this in every other restaurant in America.  Its half full.  We sit at a table next to the bar.   After 10 minutes. Highlighter girl comes up and says you can't sit here because there is a 15 minute wait for a table.  I have to sit at the actual bar top. I decided that this had all ready been the same experience and left to nothing.   No sorry, no explanation why I have to wait to sit at an empty table or why I can't wait at this table to sit at another empty table in 15 minutes.   I can't even leave fast because so many other customers are leaving pissed off over a 15 to 30 minute wait when they see 25 tables open.  Applebee's really?   Do you even want to try?  Is there a manger or regional person even trying.   I've seen some poor performance but this is the worst I've seen in customer service.  I guess one positive would be if you want to lose weight, go everyday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glendale-9?start=20,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48

45,G F.,"Hales Corners, WI",1,27,23.0,1.0,2016-03-29,"We went to this Applebees a couple weeks ago to celebrate my Mom's birthday. Although it wasn't busy- When walking in, the Hostess informs us that we'll have to wait 10 minutes to be seated and ""wait even longer because we're short on staff"". We accept and decide while waiting, we'll at least have a drink at the bar- which only had two other patrons. While waiting at the bar to order a drink, one staff is closing out the drawer so the other bartender couldn't take my order. He acknowledges that I'm theWere and tells me to ""wait"". When the staff appeared to be done closing out her drawer, the bartender STILL does not take my order.  He just tends to the other patrons already there, as I patiently wait. At this time, three other people walk in and sit down. The bartender answered their questions and as I thought he was opening the drawer, ready to take my order, the previous staff who closed her drawer, jumps back on the computer. At this point, I'm waiting 15 minutes. Our name was called for a table, and as my Mom waits at the table, I'm still waiting at the bar to order a drink. We figured at the rate this was going, if a waitress tends to her first, then I order, we'd be good with a few drinks to last our entire meal. Once the staff is done messing around on the computer/drawer, the bartender takes another patrons order first. Patrons that came after me. I let it slide and wait... Reminding him I'm still waiting, he acknowledges, and STILL takes ANOTHER patrons order. It this point, it's been 25 minutes with no order taken. My Mom is still waiting at the table and has not had anyone come to take drink orders there either. After a HALF AN HOUR, I had enough. We left and went to Buffalo Wild Wings across the street.

I knew service in the past have been bad but once it was pretty much okay praying that I would get the same service today, it didn't happen it was worse than ever. We were seated immediately but it took the waitress more than 20 minutes to come over and even after I called the waitress on the prompter that sits on your table she still did not come over right away. When she did she was apologetic for her not having a good day it was a bad night and she had too many people that she could not handle and was complaining about how her life was hell.  this turned me off. Because I didn't need to hear her problems I was hungry and I wanted to eat like three hours ago. We place our order and it took another 30 minutes to eat and when the food came out I must admit my daughters looked very well she had the appetizer sampler but when I received my fish the plate was soaked in grease, The fish was hard dry and overcooked and burnt. I sent it back and when it came back out it was yet the same by this time I'm is really starving because I'm a diabetic and I was beginning to feel sick to my stomach because of me not eating and my blood sugar dropping. The only thing that kept me afloat was eating mostly half my daughters plate and drinking the water down strawberry lemonade that was failed to be refilled. When the waitress came over she ask what was wrong and I told her. When she sent the manager over the manager had a problem because my daughter and I shared the appetizers plate instead of addressing the issue with the grease soaked fish. Because I gave my daughter a half a piece of fish to substitute for me eating nearly most half of her meal they decide to charge me for two all you can eat fish dinners. Thankfully there was a higher up manager than her. he came to the table he was very apologetic and he only charged me for the meal and drinks that my daughter had. still this is isn't enough I will never go back to this Applebee's again not even if they're giving something away for free.

Here are some of the issues we experienced: 1. We had to ask 5 separate times for our drinks, including twice from the manager.  We finally had to go the bar twice and request them. 2. Our kids meals were ordered long before our adult meals were ordered, and our adult meals came out first.  We had to ask for our kids meals, and when they came out they were cold.  And my kid's strawberries were really cold - as in frozen solid. 3. We never were asked for refills, but not surprised since our meal was more than 1/2 over before we got them in the first place. 4. Our adult meals were very bland. 5. We had to ask twice for our check and waited 15 minutes to get it so we could pay.  All throughout the meal, I was continuously looking for someone, anyone, who could help us.  No one cared enough to come to us.  Our server was nowhere to be found. 6. The place is dirty - restaurant, bathroom, bar, everything. This is just a brief summary of the issues.  The bottom line is that they have terrible, inept service, a manager that doesn't care or is incompetent, the food is bad, and it isn't the cleanest place either.  Skip this location to save your sanity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glendale-9,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44

To be seated.   The couple at the table next to us was getting ready to leave and heard me mention how hungry I was and said ""it's gonna be a while...."".  They had waited over 30 minutes for their food.    I give a star for the service because our waiter ( Carrington ) very quickly moved us to a different table because ours was rocking as he approached us.   And he took our order right away.  It's not his fault how slow the kitchen is.  Trouble with too much time waiting for our dinner is we were again struck by the uncleanliness of the place.  There was so much grime on the table condiments I hated to touch anything before eating.  It desperately needs a deep cleaning which should happen daily.   Second star is for the consistency in my dish....fiesta lime chicken is still my fav there!   But the mango iced tea taste like plain ice tea.  Even after it was replaced.  The Dollarita wasn't worth more than that  but my husband couldn't resist.  I was not tempted, knowing that house meant very low end...hence the buck.   No stars for drinks. ambiance or overall satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glendale-9,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
