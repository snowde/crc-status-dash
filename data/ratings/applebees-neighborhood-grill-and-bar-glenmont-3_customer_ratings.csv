15,T H.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,39,6.0,1.0,2013-07-07,Wow. This place continued to disappoint at every turn. They ran out if white bread for grilled cheese. Mac and cheese was right out of the Kraft box (not exaggerated) and the driest I ever had. The waitress had no idea what was going on. I usually like Applebee's for a god meal... I am shocked at the below par experience. Too bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
12,Alyssa H.,"Glenmont, NY",1,1,4.0,5.0,2014-01-21,"Being from out of town, we came here to use up some gift cards and grab a quick bite. We read the other reviews and honestly didn't know what they were talking about. The service was great and they were super friendly. We ordered the 2/$20 with an extra appetizer of nachos. Not only was there more than enough food to take for the road, but it all tasted good. Also, the place was very clean. No complaints there. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were talking about, but next time we are in town we will be sure to put this on this list of gods food and service! Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
11,Ashley L.,"Albany, NY",0,12,,1.0,2014-04-11,"Ugh I wouldn't even give this place one star! I normally love Applebees but this one is way below the standard! The staff were rude, the waitress refused to serve us because my roommate is a recovering from chemo and appears ""gay"", the other was amazing though, manager was NO WHERE to be seen, waited 45 minutes, watching two other people come, eat & go while we were still waiting, appetizers weren't even brought out until the food was and it wasn't that busy at all. The food, when it finally got to us, was cold and flavorless, my well-done burger was raw and still cold in the middle, they said it would be comped since I couldn't even eat it, was still charged for it. This is by far the worst applebees. I mean every single time I've been there it just sucked. Not worth it!  This place is garbage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
13,Barbara S.,"Delmar, NY",0,39,,2.0,2014-09-24,"We tried the ""new"" all you can eat cross cut ribs. Seemed to be the essentially same as the riblets, except that you get all that you want.  No big deal.  No real reason to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
10,David H.,"Albany, NY",43,58,28.0,3.0,2014-10-26,"My family dined here this evening after a long day. Server was very friendly. No Smithwicks or Guinness on tap. Oh well, you can't have everything. Wife and I both had 9 oz steaks which were cooked perfectly. Wife had hers rare, mine medium rare. Our daughter had a southwestern chicken dish. Heathen. She enjoyed hers as well. Only complaint ( aside from lack of quality beer) was the wait to pay the check. I would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
9,Laura K.,"Albany, NY",22,4,,5.0,2014-12-08,"Our server Lorraine was great! Friendly, with a sense of humor. Once hearing about my food allergy, she made a point to make sure things were plated separately and went to the kitchen to check on things as the food was being prepared! So amazing! The food came out hot and fresh, and the margaritas were delicious as always. The place itself looks great after the remodeling as well, with a more open layout, and more seating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
6,Reagan W.,"Delmar, NY",3,78,2.0,1.0,2015-01-03,"went here last night @5pm.  not a huge crowd by any means.  We had to wait for a booth to be cleaned (over 5 minute wait for this) ordered boneless chicken wing appetizer - they came out about 20 minutes later I cut into the first one & something wasn't just right!  We didn't see our waitress again after this.  The manager brought us our entrees surprisingly at which point we showed her the chicken bites & her response was ""hmmmmmm.....""  She seemed as if she didn't care. now onto the entrees - ordered chicken tenders (I already thought of this upon seeing our disgusting appetizer) & a triple bacon burger. Tenders were pre cooked & then frozen so we were safe there. fries were actually the best part.  their coleslaw wasn't bad either the triple bacon was pathetic.  it has 1 small piece of bacon broken up to make it look like it was 2.  the burger was burned (ordered medium) & came with nothing on it???? roughly 45 minutes into our ""dining experience"" the waitress finally reappears and asks how everything is.  I immediately ask about the condiments on the burger and address the lack of bacon issue.  her response is ""burgers don't come with any condiments.""  I very politely ask for some onions & lettuce, tomato is extra??  no bacon was ever brought even though the waitress said she would bring it out I honestly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone & wouldn't score it a star if I had a choice.  just extremely disappointed with this establishment overall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
8,Luci D.,"Schenectady, NY",34,52,12.0,3.0,2015-09-04,You really cannot expect much out of a lunch at Applebee's but it was not bad at all. My husband and Mom-in-law both enjoyed their burgers and I enjoyed my chicken pecan salad. The main reason I am posting this review is that our waitresses attire was so outlandishly disturbing that if I had the authority I would have sent her home to change. Hey I am all for pretty young girls using looks to boost tips HOWEVER - when jaws are dropping it is supposed to be a good thing - this was horrific!! I have to start with the shirt - which was not one or 2 sizes too small - it was ridiculously small! Like the actual seams were about to rip apart in every direction due to the massive amounts of stress on the fabric. The one button she managed to button was an accident about to happen as I was confident it would put someones eye out at some point during the day. I have to wonder if she thought this looked good??!? I am pretty sure nobody else did. To make matters worse (much worse) - she was wearing black leggings as pants - without underwear - when she bent over to pick up something I actually was given the whole damn floor show. WTF is wrong with this girl??? You can see every inch on your flesh which is shoved into these leggings that again are like 4 sizes too fucking small!! This is supposed to be a family restaurant - and this girl is exposing the entire bottom half of her body to the general public! It would be like me wearing pantyhose as pants to the fucking mall. I will reiterate - I can appreciate women in the service industry working their looks for tips - I was one of them! But you just look like a fucking slob - and it is so far from sexy! Wear work appropriate clothing that is flattering to your shape/size NOT just shockingly absurd because you do not own a mirror. Respect your customers enough not to make them to ill to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
5,Heather C.,"Voorheesville, NY",19,7,1.0,2.0,2015-10-11,"The food is decent, about what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. The staff is friendly and my son likes them. Today I ordered the car side to go and I waited in the designated spot for 15 minutes then I called. They said they be right out, of course they didn't have one of the items I orderd. They had my phone number,  required on the ordering, and didn't call to make a substitution. The food was cold on arrival to my car and the person bringing it out seemed bothered by the whole experience. This convenience of applebees seems to be inconvenient to all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
7,Lori M.,"Rensselaer, NY",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-04,Terrible service; food obviously sat under heat lamp; dried out & lukewarm; spoke with manager who was very dismissive. Terrible experience. $58. Never again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
2,Tracey K.,"Albany, NY",25,146,434.0,3.0,2016-08-07,I haven't been to Applebee's in quite a while so we swung in to grab a quick lunch. I really wanted to try the grilled shrimp and watermelon salad. Grilled watermelon seems to be all the rage right now. It was pretty good and a decent size salad. Lots of shrimp too! The watermelon wasn't grilled though. It was just watermelon. It didn't have the sear marks like on the menu. It was really cold and sweet though.  I'd get it again. My lunch mate got French onion and cheeseburger rolls. He said they were both pretty good.  The music I thought was a bit loud for dining. The place didn't have many people at the time and the music was blaring. Maybe when it's more crowded you don't notice it as much. The service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
4,T.C. M.,"Albany, NY",59,7,,2.0,2017-02-18,Server was okay. Parts of my meal was burnt. My wife's fries where rather cold. Had to ask for a new batch of fries to replace the cold fries. Overall was not impressed and somewhat disappointed. We will patron this Applebees again I am sure and hope we will have a be quality meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
0,Adrienne B.,"Albany, NY",33,41,307.0,3.0,2017-08-16,"Girls and I head here after a game of golf.  On Wednesdays it's two for one wine, which is perfect, because we're a large group.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  The food is your standard, family, chain restaurant with fair prices and lots of choice.  Menu has something for everybody (salads, burgers, steaks, wings, chicken, Asian inspired, gluten free, etc.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
3,Bessy V.,"Slingerlands, NY",0,6,,2.0,2017-09-09,"I received an email from Kaitlyn Czerwonka June 21, 2017 from corporate apologizing that my message was stuck in their spam and asked for my availability and phone number which I provided. I replied 2 days later and have never heard back. I guess customers complaints are not that important.  Today I dined at the Applebees in Glenmont, NY. We ordered the sampler and the order came in 3 parts with the quesadilla coming after the other items and the tortilla chips after that. The waitress kept apologizing and even told us the kitchen was having problems. I wanted the chicken caprese, but it wasn't available so I ordered the cavatappi with chicken, spinach and tomatoes. It was ok at best. The spinach was frozen, not fresh. My dad ordered the 8oz. Sirloin with Parmesan shrimp. The sirloin came as two 4 ounce steaks, not one 8 ounce steak and he had ordered medium and received it well done. The Parmesan shrimp arrived 10 minutes after that. She apologized again for the lateness and took 10% off the bill. My dad only ate one 4 ounce steak since it wasn't prepared as ordered. The place was not even busy so I am not sure why they were having so much trouble. I heard the waitress tell other patrons they were out of chicken caprese, 4 ounce, 6 ounce and 8 ounce steaks. Wow, who is in charge of ordering? So many things should not be out. It was embarrassing and I was disappointed. Management needs to look into this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
1,Richard S.,"Glenmont, NY",0,124,,3.0,2017-12-26,Wife and I had the 2 for $20 today.  The boneless wings appetizer was really good.  We really liked the bbq sauce.  The entrees were fine and the service was excellent.  Good value for the money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-glenmont-3,,,,,
