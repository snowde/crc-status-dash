39,Juliana C.,"Dallas, TX",4,8,6.0,1.0,2012-06-09,"worst experience ever!  My husband and I came here hoping to enjoy a nice lunch date, instead we couldn't get out of there any faster. Staff is horrible and service is worse. We ordered an appetizer to eat before our entrée and they never brought it to us, instead they gave it to the people sitting behind us. They didn't even realize their mistake until my husband asked them to remove it from our bill; they ended up giving the appetizer to our neighbors for free and their only way to compensate for their mistake was to continue to only apologize. On top of that we couldn't even enjoy our entrée because there was flies swarming our food every five seconds. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3?start=60,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
26,Jan F.,"Colleyville, TX",53,303,123.0,2.0,2012-06-20,"We were looking for a place to have a late breakfast after walking in Grapevine Mills one morning.   Seeing nothing better and nothing that was open, we noticed the Applebee's across the street with an ""Open"" sign, so in we went.  We were enthusiastically greeted and taken to our choice of seats. There was no one else there at such an early hour (about 10:30 AM), for good reason.  They don't serve anything close to something you might want to have for breakfast or even brunch.  So we had our 'lunch' early. We both opted for something off the Weight Watchers approved menu item list (we had been walking, after all!), both were OK. My Grilled Jalapeño Shrimp looked better to me than his Creamy Parmesan Chicken.  We both ate until there was nothing left to take home (we had been walking and it was late, OK?) With two iced teas, that in the beginning tasted like leftover tea, our bill came to almost $30 before a ""Golden Apple"" senior discount of 15%.  There are some advantages to being over 55.   But still, we felt that the cost was a bit too high for the food and the atmosphere. Service was friendly and adequate.  Iced tea refills were served warm, with no ice.  I noticed a Ranger calendar in the Ladies Room that was a few weeks outdated.   There is no good reason to return that I can come up with.  Two plus would probably be a better rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3?start=60,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

The server took forever to take our order for drinks and food. He was not very accommodating or friendly. When our order arrive our server did not check to see if we were okay and needed anything else. I was really disappointed in the service at this Applebee's. Our food was luke warm when it arrived.

We went after a birthday party my daughter had attended so we were all worn out and tired. We got sat right away in a booth, the girls up front even gave my daughter extra crayons. The server was really nice and stayed on top of everything. My husband said his food wasn't the best ... some sort of steak something which living in the land of a million stake places its hard to beat the nice steak places when it is a chain such as this resturant ... but wasn't as bad as it could have been. My daughter had mac & cheese and it wasn't gross! Which almost anytime she gets it somewhere I roll my eyes cause I know she will say its not like what I make at home but it wasn't bad. I was excited because my fries had very little pepper on them which when we go to other applebee's they are usually so peppered I can't eat them. The tenders I ended up eatting were not fatty/gressy as chicken tenders can get at bulk preped places and I ended up eatting 3-4 of them when I normally stop at 1-2.

Second, service was terrible. It wasn't busy, yet our waiter seemed distracted the entire time, wasn't personable at all and was SLOW. He also said bacon wasn't included in the house salad (menu clearly stated it was), forgot the salad dressing and forgot the dipping sauce with our dessert.

Appetizer chicken wonton was good. Main course was really disappointing. I got the chicken penne, and it literally have five tiny slivers of grilled chicken on top. It wasn't enough to feed a small cat.  So I had to wait five minutes to hunt down our server to see if I could get more chicken on the side. She just said ""yeah"" and when she brought it she never said sorry or ""I hope this makes up for it."" Then I bite into it, and it was completely bland. Not even salt helped.  Oh, and we just got the bill, and they charged us $4 for extra chicken! I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt and be positive and understanding.  At this point, I was fed up....I grabbed the bill, looked at it, and said ""Oh no, we are NOT paying for that!

I ordered a steak, usually don't because I'm usually disappointed, again no exception here. Taste was ok, but I ordered it medium rare. It came more rare, which was ok except that it was not cooked right. It had the 'seer marks' but the rest was an unappetizing grey color.

If they are going to allow smoking it should be at least a semi closed off area. We noticed at least two tables walk in with a disgusted look on their face and ask to be seated further away from the smoking section (sorry, there is no escaping it).

Frozen prepackaged patties??!! EW! I asked if I could substitute it for the classic burger (which is cheaper) they said no. My friend then ordered a sangria, it was a cup filled to the brim with large chunks of ice, in 2 sips it was gone. That's terrible, needless to say I won't be returning to Applebees any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
4,John M.,"Austin, TX",346,429,1371.0,5.0,2017-07-20,"Last review I wrote for Applebees was 2013, back in Austin...This was walking distance for our adventure for Lego Land, Aquarium and the hotel we stayed at for the weekend. I will give to them for the constant attempt at menu changes, keeping it new and inviting. This experience was really out of bounds for us...something we talked about on the way back to Austin...Service was great...but the food stood out...Simply put, it was perfect....We have had the pretzels with cheese sauce before, and the new improved sauce it outstanding...We would visit just for these..Wife had the fish and chips...crisp, hot and the fresh...Fries crispy...4 cheese mac with Honey pepper chicken with Bacon...thick chunks of Bacon...Mac was super creamy...you would think the chicken pieces, as small as they were would be over cooked...But NOPE...Tender and Juicy with a great flavor....Mini cheese burger was devoured by our granddaughter...We are both a ""Bang for your Buck"" Yelpers, and both of our entrees were just over $12 each...it was truly worth it...Are they on the Radar...Yes..Yes they are..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

13,Bryan B.,"Katy, TX",0,8,2.0,2.0,2017-08-23,"I was in Dallas on business and this Applebees was within walking distance of my hotel.  The food was definitely nothing to talk about. The spinach dip was burned, the chips were crumbs, and the salmon and steak was mediocre at the very best (that's probably being nice).  The bar area also allows smoking so the entire place reeks of stale nasty cigarette smoke.  We asked to sit at the very back of the restaurant away from the bar which helped slightly with the smell, but not completely.  The two stars are purely for their all day happy hour deals they had.  Very good drink deals and the drinks were actually pretty good! My advice, go full, and order a liquid diet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

Probably will never be back. The food here was eh... it wasn't that good. The boneless chicken wing looked and tasted like it has been out waiting. The server seemed a little bit too tired or a bit off. So every time I would ask for something, he would forget and it wasn't busy or anything. It was around 1-2 AM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grapevine-3,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
