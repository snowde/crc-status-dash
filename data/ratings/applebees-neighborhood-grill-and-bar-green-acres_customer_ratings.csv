20,Mauro R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",53,183,26.0,2.0,2013-03-24,"The problem with this Applebee's is that it is located in the same shopping center as Duffy's and it pays the price for it.  Especially in the first 3 days of the week (I consider Monday the first day), you can notice the difference between Applebee's (half empty) and Duffy's (always packed). I think the issue with Applebee's is that it is not quite a restaurant, but not quite a sport bar, so it might get often skipped when it comes to make a choice in favor of other places.  Service at the bar can be very slow even when it is not busy, waiting staff has quite a different pace compared to Duffy's.  Food is okay, it's Applebee's so you need to have the right expectations. Drinks are also okay, but again, there is a little of lack of personality, which might not be surprising for a big franchise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres?start=20,,,,,
12,Larry J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",25,108,109.0,5.0,2013-07-29,"Veterans Day addendum:  I happened to stop by my favorite Applebee's today, it turned out to be Veterans Day. As a veteran I really appreciated the recognition. Not only was their recognition of service, but also servers were wearing a special T-shirt  in honor of the occasion. In addition to that, a special menu was handed out to all veterans. This was not a collage of the cheap stuff on the menu, either. JD consented to having his  picture accompany this Veterans Day addendum. On your next visit to this location ask for him. First of all, in contrast to the previous revierer: I hate Duffy's. I've been going there for years and never had a really good dining  experience. On the other hand, I have been going to this Applebee's location on a regular basis for several years as well and have never had a negative experience. The menu is varied and is change very often. I do wish they would offer or seafood such as salmon. Any other fried seafood additions would be welcomed by me. Services always friendly and prompt.  Happy Hour never ends. That is always a plus. Prices are reasonable. You simply can't go wrong with anything you order at Applebee's. It's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,
16,Rebecca S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",232,264,115.0,4.0,2013-09-06,"Everyone seems so upset with this Applebee's! I will tell you that in the past, I did have a bad experience here, but that was quite a bit ago. Recently, I began enjoying the cocktails and appetizers with friends. One of the cocktails, Summer Squeeze, sounded good but then when it arrived, I sent it back - too sweet and not what I expected. (The waitress kindly replaced the beverage for me.) My friends ordered Perfect Margaritas, generic vodka-soda, and I opted for the Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea. I must say, the TSLIIT was the best choice of the night. For apps, you can never go wrong with the Green Bean Crispers - they're addictive! I must point out that the chips that came with the salsa appetizer and the spinach & artichoke dip tasted BAD... I would have rather eaten the paper napkins under my plate than eat those chips again. (I'm sure it was a fluke?) Overall, it may not be THE BEST but it sure does the trick when you're in the mood for pretty decent drinks & can stomach ""just okay"" apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,

6,Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,113,,1.0,2015-06-22,"Had lunch here today - probably our 20th visit in 12 months.  It is/rather was our default choice when we want a fast meal rather than a dining experience. It took 26 minutes for the food to arrive after the order was placed.  It was not possible to get a drink refill and our request for additional ""bottomless"" chips were ignored repeatedly. Our server was very friendly and very nice but impossible to find.  It took us forever to find her to get the check and then it took close to 25 minutes for her to bring back the check for a signature and return the credit card. She must have been very busy but we could not even find her on the floor; however, she was very nice, just totally ineffective. My husband ordered a philly cheese steak specialty sandwich and that was fine.  I ordered their ""hog special"" sandwich and there were 2 pieces of ham on it and one small piece of bacon and no pulled pork - an expensive sandwich with almost no meat and most of the stated ingredients were missing.  We could not get that rectified so I gave up and ate it because, again, we could not find our server. No one goes to an Applebee's expecting a great meal.  Generally the food is adequate, the environment clean and the service usually reasonably adept. Today 1/2 the food was inferior and the service was non-existent.  We will return but will set some ground rules upfront with the server so we do not have a repeat performance of what happened today.  Our server was very pleasant but the restaurant was either understaffed or she was playing hide and seek with her customers....and she won every time...we never could find her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,
17,Meryl V.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,2,,1.0,2015-08-14,"Where do I begin?  Ordered the wedge salad WITHOUT BACON. Guess what?? There was bacon on it and I am a vegetarian. The waiter told the Manager ""there were 2 pieces accidentally on the plate"" - really????  The Siracha Shrimp- HORRIBLE!!! The picture on the menu is nothing like the delivery of this dish. No crunchies on the plate just plain fried shrimp.  The Manager was in the kitchen and it took a while for him to come to our table.  My friend had a very dried out hamburger that fell apart to pieces and looked like chop meat. Grilled onions- very burnt and unedible. The manager took those items off the bill - but still would not eat here AGAIN!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,
13,Farah B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,11,1.0,5.0,2015-09-25,"Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The manager personally made sure we were happy with everything , more than once. I ordered the wings which never disappoint, as well as the potstickers. I can probably have 3 orders in 1 sitting.  My husband had the bacon cheese hurger. It was cooked perfectly. Their new moonshine drinks were also delish. I would recommend this particular Applebee's to everyone.

10,Andrew R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,3,,3.0,2015-11-11,"My girlfriend works down the road from this applebees and we decided to go there after I surprised her at work for lunch. The place was NOT THAT busy and we got sat asap. We were there for a short time and then the waitress came over for our drink order. We gave it to her and told her we were on a lunch break and had limited time. She came back with drinks and took our order asap. We both ordered burger and fries to make it fast and easy. Both burgers medium. Now, you would think it can't get any easier then this right???? NOPE.  BOTH were burned to a crisp. I'd I say well, well, and DONE  yeah, the kitchen fell a sleep or were something. Our waitress was on top of it and got it corrected very quickly.

I ordered a chicken Cesar salad and 2 steak sirloin dinners, cooked medium. I got one steak dinner cooked medium rare, with the salad at the same time. The second steak dinner was not served at the same time, and it was cooked well done. I spoke to the manager, who is oblivious to what's going on in his restaurant. The cook either forgot his glasses, or can't read English. The other table of party of 4 got their salads 1/2 hr later after sitting down. I will not return to this location.

5,Lynn A.,"Homosassa, FL",48,92,381.0,4.0,2016-03-08,"Admittedly, I was told ""Be afraid, be very afraid..."" Of eating at this Appleebees . My daughter ate here , rather- tried to eat here because they had been given a  gift card. Their food was so dreadful that they just couldn't eat . They had ordered only burgers! They were given a choice of  temperature"" Pink  or not pink "". The manager saw the food and comped the meal, charging for the drinks , and they left without eating. Which brings me to why I am here. I am now the recipient of the remainder of the gift card.. I ordered the pepper crusted Sirloin and grains , one  of three items that looked healthy and good and under 600 cal on the menu.  I substituted the grains ( not realizing that's where the roasted  tomatoes and Portabella were) for the broccoli.  I must admit I actually was really scared, but the sliced Sirloin was perfectly done as ordered , and nicely seasoned . The Broccoli  was a little over cooked and soft but fresh and good, and thanks to the really great bartender , Demi, they gave me the roasted tomatoes  anyway upon my request. For the price it really was fine! Phew! I actually really would come back here for a quick dinner on a busy night. It's Applebee's , folks, not fine dining. The food was prepared well , it was good , I ate my steak, broccoli and roasted tomatoes and I enjoyed it and the bartender, Demi,  was extremely efficient and very nice . The mediocre house wine, Copper Ridge , is part of the "" 2 for 1"" but they have Mondavi Cabernet for a tiny  step up. Go for it! The bartender Demi- she deserves kudos for adding good service , very efficient, fast service and her excellent attitude. She is an asset and enhances Applebee's and I hope she is tipped and appreciated accordingly .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,

Tonight I had their sex on the beach, the chicken wontons & spinach dip for appetizers, & for my moms meal: the fried shrimp dish & I got the half rack of ribs. Literally everything was so good. I have no complaints on their food. Our waitress Maelina was awesome. The ONLY reason I took a star off was because when I was eating, we were close to the door/hostess area & the girls were so unprofessional. They were gossiping, cursing, & were on their phones.

Every time we asked her for something, she would walk away before we finished our sentence.  The food was okay. Typical chain restaurant stuff.  The steak was actually cooked perfect.

3,Marj T.,"West Palm Beach, FL",55,22,2.0,3.0,2017-05-21,"Haven't been to an Applebees in probably 5 or 6 years.  We stopped in because we wanted something quick and close by for tonight's dinner while we were out running our final errands of the weekend.   The wait for a booth at around 630pm on a Sunday night was pretty quick (5min).  The hostess was nice and engaged with my toddler with crayons and a coloring sheet.   Our waitress was nice enough.  We ordered two entrees between husband and I and decided to just share with our 3yo instead of ordering a kids meal as she can get picky.  It wasn't until we were about 3/4 through our meal that we noticed a special in one of the table flyers that all kids meals were just $1.99 on Sundays - for us it wasn't a price issue that we didn't get something separate for our daughter but it would have been nice if our waitress mentioned any specials from the start. All the food being delivered to tables around us all smelled really good.  We didn't get the sizzling options that many people did though so that was almost regrettable once ours came out. I tried the caprese mozzarella chicken - its was OK.  The tomatoes and red onions were soggy.  My husband liked his brisket tacos but we were all underwhelmed with the fries.   Overall, the experience was alright.  Nothing about the food was spectacular enough to get us making a trip back anytime soon though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-green-acres,,,,,

At first, it was great; servers & waiter were very respectful & outgoing. I ordered a strawberry lime margarita & it was amazing; they even give you some extra which I thought was awesome! The appetizers (wings, chips & salsa) were even good. The reason for the 2/5 rating was the entrees. The burgers we ordered weren't cooked, I've never been served a burger so rare in my entire life. It looked completely raw, made my stomach turn. The waiter specifically asked about how we like it cooked and we specified ""no pink"" however that's not what they received.
