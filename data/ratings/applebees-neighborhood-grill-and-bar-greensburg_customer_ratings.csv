14,Vanessa S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,5.0,2015-12-30,I attended for the grand opening and this place is FABULOUS! It's set up different than most Applebee's with a nice patio area off the bar. All the food was delicious and the staff was great! I will definitely be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
6,Emily T.,"Greensburg, PA",2,23,,4.0,2016-02-18,"This place was great. New and much nicer than other Applebees, however quite small. We were sat immediately. It was pretty busy. I liked the idea of the computer pads at the tables but the wait staff seemed annoyed with it and whoever came up with it did not have a good advertising pitch for it as far a uses. You can order from it, request a drink or your server and play games while you wait. Defeats the purpose of having a server really.  I haven't been to an Applebees in probably 5 years and they ditched the old menu to the looks of it. Good thing. Much simpler menu, clean cut.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an app. Nothing phenomenal. It was ok. Bread instead of chips would've been better. We did have to wait for about 25 minutes for our food. Nothing good conversation couldn't kill. I had the 4 cheese mac and peppered chicken. It was awesome! Great taste and hot!  The waitress was very busy but she still found time to drop by a couple of times. She was a great waitress.  Overall, I would prb return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
13,J F.,"Loyalhanna, PA",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-20,"Just ate here and the food is subpar at best, ordered a shrimp parmesan sirloin and the garlic sauce was so overpowering that it made the entire steak unpalatable not to mention that the steak itself was lukewarm at best.  Complained to the manager who simply said I'll look into why the garlic flavor was so overpowering, he did not seem to care that I was unsatisfied, no offer to take anything off of the bill or to get another steak done right just that he would look into it.  The wait staff however is fantastic so I have no complaints about them but the food itself needs some serious work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
10,Mitch M.,"Blairsville, PA",39,1,,5.0,2016-02-24,"We went around 3:30 on a Tuesday and it wasn't very busy so we were seated promptly. The building still has the 'new' look and feel to it which is nice. It was very clean inside. Our waitress was very kind and attentive and helpful. You are able to reorder drinks directly from your table via a touch-screen pad, as well as pay your bill and other things (some features like games cost money) if you choose to. I'd been to another Applebee's in Greensburg a long time ago and I remember it not being very good, but this one totally exceeded my expectations. We sat on the bar side in a half booth/half high chair table that can seat 6. Our food arrived decently quick and was a lot better than I had anticipated. The bathrooms were also clean and they had a touch-free handle on the door that can be opened using your forearm which is always nice to see. We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
9,Mark U.,"Greensburg, PA",0,10,,2.0,2016-03-01,"This Applebees is in the old location of the Pepperwood Restaurant (terrific place!!!). Was to an Applebees years ago in Mt Pleasant and enjoyed it. Exact opposite here. Ordered the Bourbon Steak - medium. Arrived after a long time (not busy either) and was well done. The waitress graciously took it back and the manager even came by. When the next one arrived, it appeared to be cooked more to medium. As I ate it I realized that it did not even taste like any steak I have had - and I eat a fair amount of steak. This one appeared to be precooked in water??? Had nooooo taste at all and was water on my plate afterwards! Also ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and it was very weak (maybe just iced tea - no booze). Prob will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
7,Jonas S.,"Indiana, PA",33,20,2.0,5.0,2016-03-26,"I have not been to Applebee's for a while. I love this restaurant.  I had an awesome (but not spicy enough for me) blazzin texas burger. I lived the brisket on  there. Jalapeños gave a little kick to it. I wish that there were more jalapeños on it. The food came really fast. The staff was very friendly and attentive from beginning to end.  I will definitely be back.  I wish that there was an Applebee's in Indiana, PA!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
12,Mandi M.,"Export, PA",0,15,,1.0,2016-04-10,"Worst experience I've ever had at an Applebee's... Very disappointed. I love the Applebee's in Irwin and in Murrysville. This one is awful. We went with a few friends, didn't get drinks for 15 minutes, and didn't get our order taken for another 15-20. We ordered the 2 for 25 and asked for spinach dip as our app. We never received the appetizer. When the entrees came, we told them we didn't get the app, and they said oh. And he STILL didn't bring it. I also asked for a glass of wine.... He didn't bring the wine until we were about to leave saying they forgot!!! I didn't even want it at that point. And they STILL charged us for everything! He gave us the spinach dip as we were walking out and said we could have it ""to-go"" I didn't want it to go! I wanted it before my meal. Absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention, another table didn't tip him well, and he was continuously cursing and dropping F-Bombs because he was mad! So unprofessional. Can you believe just to pay with cash, our friend had to get up and find him to pay?!?! He wouldn't come back to our table for us to pay him! I've never had to hunt down a waiter to pay for a meal......... WOW!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
5,Greg C.,"Germantown, OH",22,26,32.0,1.0,2016-04-22,So sad. Use to go to Applebee's all the time and can't believe how bad it is now. Had to get our own menus to start with. Waitress forgot our order even after writing it down. Chips with the spinach dip was way over salted. Once our meals came 4 total the 2 burger orders where ok. The 1 didn't have any quinoa even though supposed to. The other 1 the chicken was burnt like it been reheated 3 or 4 times. The onion rings on top was also burnt and greasy. Was supposed to have gravy but alas there was none. What used to be a decent chain restaurant to go to now is Not. Both my kids use to work at Applebee's and ate there weekly. Doubtful will eat here again.  Place was dead for a Friday night at 9 pm. Wait staff seems to not worry about customers and just seemed slow. Think I saw 1 hustle while here. Even after sending burnt chicken back the manager never came over once. REALLY?  Table next to us had burnt food also,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
11,Kim E.,"New Alexandria, PA",48,7,,5.0,2016-04-24,"So happy that Greensburg finally got an Applebee's.   Love their food from appetizers down to our meals.   My husband and I got steaks, made exactly as we wanted and we really didn't have a long wait time for food.  When it was brought to our table it was hot and ready to be devoured,  which we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
4,Mark A.,"Latrobe, PA",8,28,8.0,4.0,2016-05-24,"Excellent service here, and the staff is friendly and observant. I also give the management kudos for what they have done with the place. Very comfortable and the food was good; especially good for a casual dining chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
15,Brooke M.,"Greensburg, PA",1,8,3.0,3.0,2016-05-30,"Although Applebee's is not one of my favorite restaurants, I keep giving this one chances, based on location convenience and hopes that it might someday grow on me. It seems to be very hit or miss. The last time I was here, I ordered a gin and ginger ale and it was very strong (yay!). It was also during this visit that I ordered salmon with grilled vegetables and sweet potato fries, which was without a doubt the best meal I've had here (double yay!). The thai shrimp salad is a safe choice, but always leaves me hungry. The maple bacon chicken piadini is good, but not as flavorful as I hoped it'd be, as it sounds like it should be a unique wrap. The lack of flavor is what disappoints me time after time at Applebee's, but that isn't unique to this location. Upsides are that the staff is very friendly and eager to serve. They've also seemed to make the best of the large space that Pepperwood (very tragically) left behind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
3,Colleen S.,"Pittsville, MD",41,13,1.0,2.0,2016-07-11,"I got the steak and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The broccoli had brown burns on it. The steaks were done wrong so my sister and I traded steaks.  Appetizer was fried cheese sticks and were good. Steak and potatoes tasted good. Waitress friendly. The Applebee's near my home in Maryland is head and shoulders better than this in terms of the broccoli, and the mashed potatoes come plentiful, not it a little ice cream scoop like at this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
2,Deborah N.,"Greensburg, PA",28,229,417.0,3.0,2016-07-31,"Although this Applebee's has been open for several months, this was our first time at the Greensburg location.  I have always liked this chain and really haven't had a bad experience at any of their restaurants.  We were greeted as soon as we entered and the hostess started to show us to a booth.  It wasn't cleaned off, so she asked us to wait while she cleaned the booth herself.  She came back, apologized for the delay and we were seated.  We started reading menus and our server came over to say he would give us time to decide on our drink order.  I liked that as sometimes I feel rushed into ordering drinks.  I ordered the Peach sangria and husband chose an Angry Orchard.  When the server returned with our drinks, we ordered our meal.          The appetizer was the pretzels with the white cheddar beer dip and honey-mustard dip.  I liked it very much and would order it again.  As for the main entrees my husband tried the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry and I ordered the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken.  We didn't have to wait very long for our food to be served.  Husband liked his stir fry, but he said he liked my dish better.  As for me, i thought the chicken was a little too crispy and hard to cut into.  It even looked a little black on one side.  The garlic-cheddar mashed potatoes were very tasty as were the onion rings.  I couldn't finish my meal and husband got the leftovers.          No complaints on the service.  Our server was friendly and accommodating.  He was very busy with other customers, but managed to keep coming by our table to check if we needed anything.          Three stars as I thought the chicken was overdone, even if husband disagrees.  (Let him get his own Yelp account and write his own review.) Also, the Peach sangria may have looked tasty, it lacked something and tasted bland.  I am sure that we will return to eat here again, but I will try something else for my entree and husband can order the crispy chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
8,Gabrielle S.,"Bristol, PA",3,108,,1.0,2016-08-02,"Went to this one once and it will be my last. The service was awfully slow, two of the 3 people had chicken(myself being one) and both is us were sick the next day. The value for the fold was good, but the food and service were terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
1,Brian F.,"Greensburg, PA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-04-02,"If no stars were an option, I would wouldn't give any... how hard is it to make French fries? They were so salty I couldn't eat them. The riblets were nothing but bone a fat.  Waitress was disinterested.  I came because I had a gift card. I won't be back. Too many other good restaurants that actually care about your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
0,Breanna K.,"Greensburg, PA",161,1,,4.0,2017-10-10,"Just wanted to give an update to my last review. The Applebee's manager received my complaint that I left on their website, which corporate received and the manager of the Greensburg location called me, heard me out and offered an apology. He explained to me how they do things, which was bot done the right way the night I was there, but I really did appreciate him reaching out to me. I don't hold grudges and their food is good so in the future I'll most likely go back to this location. I just wanted it to be recognized that your voice can be heard, and mine was and I am very appreciative of that. I accepted their apology and that goes a long way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensburg,,,,,
