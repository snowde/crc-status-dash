12,Tammy P.,"Greenville, SC",5,17,,3.0,2014-11-20,We used to eat there every week and I got aggravated at the waitress standing there telling us her life story while we were trying to eat. Also the food got to where it was not that good. But tonight we tried it again and it was perfect everything cooked great. Chris the manager was so nice when I called back to tell him it was great and how wonderful the young lady at car side to go was so we will start going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
11,Tim R.,"Greenville, SC",0,7,6.0,1.0,2014-12-09,"Entire restaurant smells of smoke.  It's almost 2015. They need to get with the program and go smoke free. A ""non-smoking section"" is as useless as a ""no peeing section"" in a swimming pool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
10,Juan M.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,2015-12-17,"Please do not visit this store. We experienced poor service, particularly our server Dominiqua cleared our table before we were ready to leave, and in the times we addressed concerns about our orders the attitudes of all employees who visited our table were rude and our requests were ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
9,Alicia G.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",47,19,5.0,3.0,2016-01-20,What can I say we r on White Horse road LOL it's always sometimes we get good food others time it's bad but it's ok I guess.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
4,Nita B.,"Travelers Rest, SC",130,237,161.0,1.0,2016-02-29,"This location just can't seem to get it right . We were sat at a dirty table , then were never given silverware and the food just was not good . The rice was crunchy and the chicken over cooked . My daughters Shrimp was good , thus the one star but that ended the good . Just go to a different location .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
7,Sharon W.,"Taylors, SC",60,51,39.0,2.0,2016-05-18,Don't bother you're better off at a local hibachi restaurant.  Service was nice was but food was dry and super small portioned.  I felt like I ate like a toddler.  Ribs on mother's plate had little meat & too much sauce. Potatoes on the sizzlin chicken were simply sad.  Chips for the dip was more like crumbs at the bottom of the bowl.  I'd not been here since 2012... not planning on coming back any time soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
6,Food L.,"Pickens, SC",2,7,3.0,1.0,2016-07-22,"Ordered shrimp n Parmesan steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli with cheese ate at the bar.. Food took 30-45 minutes to come out.. There was not a full house, so I'm not sure why it took so long to come out.. Used to work there and I'm pretty sure the food was suppose to come out on a hot skillet and the potatoes were disgusting took one bite and didn't finish them, the steak was suppose to be medium, it came out dry and well done, I ate the broccoli and cheese paid my tab and left didn't even bother to complain... VERY DISAPPOINTED IN APPLEBEES",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
8,Rebecca M.,"Fairhope, AL",0,35,10.0,1.0,2016-07-22,"I gave it one star because you can't do a zero. The food was terrible. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The burger was ok but French fries were cold and stale. My friend ordered the chicken cesaer salad. The chicken was rubbery, wilted lettuce, and drowned in really bad dressing. You're better off going to McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
5,Cesar M.,"Greenville, SC",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-25,"Veryyyyy poor service :( don't visit this restaurant, Do not waste your time and money,I was waiting 40 minutes, and no one came to take my order the worst service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
3,Robert P.,"Greenville, SC",200,149,72.0,1.0,2017-10-05,"After a disappointing experience at O'Reilly auto store I decided to have an appetizer and drink. The bartender was seemingly having a bad day, then I learned he was actually having a good day.  LOL for sure as I had to wait to get her attention, beg for drink and appetizer specials as well. After she would mention something like their dollar margaritas, that we're on special, she would then add that they were flavorless, came with no salt and that the people that made the mistake of ordering them didn't tip anyway!   My visit with misery is now over. I will continue to thank God for allowing me to recognize and move forward with a positive day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
1,Shawn T.,"Seneca, SC",18,19,4.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"If I could give this Applebee's a NEGATIVE  I definitely would even with my BAD experience being 4 years ago. I have been back to this Applebee's many times since but always have that conversation stuck in my head FOREVER and if I had known about Yelp that day I would have recorded the incident and posted it for everyone in the world to see!!!  This is what happened that night: We are on a double date. Dinner and a movie but we did it backwards that night. We went to the movie first or we would not have seen the movie after going to Applebee's.  So after the movie we were all starving and all loved Applebee's so we made a  line to eat.  We end up seating ourselves after waiting almost 10 for the Hostess. Strike 1 Once the waitress finally noticed my ""excuse me ma'am on the 5-6 time she strolled past me with the hostess I stepped in front of them to say we were ready to order. She stated ""sorry I saw you seat yourselves we had an issue that required their attention at that moment"" I let it go because we were starving Strike 2 She seemed like a very sweet older lady.  So she asked us for our drink orders, 4 sweet teas is what we ordered. She started to walk away. ""I'll get your drinks while you decide what you want"" SERIOUSLY  was getting annoyed by then when I stopped her to explain we already knew what we wanted, she slumped her shoulders like I was keeping her from something while getting our meal orders. Strike 3 I still was smiling at this point and being respectful.  She returns with our drinks and I noticed the look on my friends face as they took a sip of the tea and asked if there was a problem. I tasted mine and OMG  it was sour. I wait a couple (2) minuets and walked over to the waitress and hostess to let her know the issue with the tea. Once she came back to the table where I was already sitting again, she said something that turned everyone at the table like someone threw a match in a gascan  They did NOT turn to the waitress, they turned to me because she hit a nerve so deep I was instantly shaking the RACIST WAITRESS had the nerve to say ""what's wrong with the tea, NOT GHETTO ENOUGH FOR YOU?"" I do not throw the ""racist"" word around ever but when she said that ghetto comment I was on If she had said it with a smile I would have politely asked her to refrain from such derogatory statements in from of my family or something polite without making a big deal. Instead she said it with a major attitude and rolled her eyes when I said ""excuse me what did you just say"" she repeated it and said ""I know how you people like your tea sweet""  I was biting my tongue so hard I could taste blood as I excused myself from the table in search of the Manager and my guests who by the way were caucasian African-American and Mexican were ready to leave when she said that but I was starving and was NOT going to ruin our night no matter the ignorance in the room. Strike 4, 5 & 6 I found the manger and asked if I could speak to him outside that way I do not say anything to cause a commotion or be overheard by any people that would cause a problem with what was said. He walked outside and I explained everything to him and instead of taking my complaint seriously he tried to defend the waitress which was making my blood boil, like he wasn't believing what I said. Until I'm guessing another staff member told her what I was saying to the manager and she rushed outside to plead her case on why she said it. They both said that the comment is used in the back and won't happen again. I told the manager I wanted him to prepare our meals because I did not want any of the staff to mess with it. He complied by watching our meals get made and also paid for our meals. Still every time I go to Applebee's I instantly want to leave once that waitress walked by or if someone reminded me of her and her ignorance",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
0,Sunny L.,"Centennial, CO",80,129,65.0,3.0,2018-01-02,I had to go home for my grandmas funeral and we drove 26+ hours to get there. We decided to stop here but it wasn't my 1st choice I was overruled. The server was sweet and attentive but the kitchen wasn't the best. My sisters food came out with hair in it. I had chicken and shrimp and it was pretty good but I was told by a friend whose worked at Applebee's everything is pretty much frozen then cooked. Not sure if this is true but if so that's awful. I would prefer my food fresh. But the server was great when it came to my food allergies. Even brought me  a book with all the ingredients. My fiancé for the same dish and liked it a lot. Restaurant isn't in the best part of town. I'd probably never return but not a horrible choice. They get 5 stars for customer service but 2-3 stars for food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
2,Chong S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-02,Did not know smoking was still allowed in restaurants. Service was terrible. We were seated down at a table and it took around 10 minutes for our server 'Destiny' to greet us. The place had maybe 10 tables with people. We placed our order and waited another 5-6 minutes for our Pepsi. When the drinks never came we got up and walked out. Terrible serivice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenville-18,,,,,
