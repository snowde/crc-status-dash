28,Sarah A.,"Augusta, GA",98,10,6.0,1.0,2014-05-11,"When Applebee's was coming to Grovetown, I was pretty excited. I was so wrong.  We've come here a few times in hopes that it'll be better than the past times, and it never is.  THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.  We have waited over an hour to get our food every time we've come here, and when it finally arrives, it is beyond disappointing. As an example, last time I got the avocado and strawberry salad, which was supposed to come with grilled chicken on a bed of romaine and arugula. I got a couple strawberry slices and a couple chunks of avocado and a piece of avocado skin with rubbery chicken on a bed of spinach that was clearly very old (read: wilted). Ugh. It seems like there's a problem with the kitchen, because the serving staff seems more than competent, not to mention friendly. And usually the manager come out and apologizes and gives us a free app or discount or fronts our meal.  So pretty much every time we come it's a 2.5-4 hour ordeal and we get free food.  I'd honestly pay to just go in, have a good experience and decent food brought out the first time, and get out. But this place just won't let that happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003
31,Aron K.,"Harlem, GA",1,2,,1.0,2014-06-16,"You'd think one Applebee's would be just like any other but in the case of the Grovetown location you'd be way off. Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, from being seated to out the door. Poor wait staff, poorly cooked food, and an overall dirty place considering its brand new. Not sure what's gone wrong here but they'd have to pay ME to ever try this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003
21,Audri P.,"Grovetown, GA",106,171,74.0,1.0,2014-07-05,Horrible service.  The food is mediocre at best.  We waited over an hour to be seated and then waited another hour for our food to arrive.   Unacceptable.   The staff are nice but the wait times are what makes the service BAD.

27,Richard M.,"Thunderbird Heights/Wilmot Desert Estate, Tucson, AZ",17,2,,1.0,2014-07-11,"Service was extremely poor. Food wasn't bad, not perfect. The wait staff seemed very confused. The manager was unkept in his dress appearance. He never came thru the restaurant to see how things were going. I never saw him once. It took 10 minutes before a waiter showed up then it took 45 minutes from the time we sat to when received our food. The manager did compensate our check for the bad service.

25,Maria L.,"Evans, GA",1,14,,1.0,2014-12-22,"Customer service was extremely slow.  We ordered appetizers and there were no plates or utensils brought out at the time.  By the time they were brought out, we had already finished our appetizers.  The main courses came separately vice at once.  Overall the wait between requests was a 10-15 min wait.  We could see the frustration on other customers waiting for their drinks and food as well. There was no waiting line and the place was not packed.  Quality of food was poor.  The burger was small and the grilled chicken tasted like it was first boiled then thrown on the grill for grill marks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
22,Eazey A.,"Augusta, GA",1,41,2.0,1.0,2015-01-29,"I thought it nothing less than appropriate to write this review as I sit in a Carside ToGo spot for 18 minutes and counting. Like, really Applebee's? The purpose of calling in an order is so that the customer doesn't have to wait, and wait staff doesn't have to serve. But here we are, 20 minutes later...and still counting.

29,Joey Y.,"Grovetown, GA",18,43,40.0,3.0,2015-02-18,"I reviewed this location about eight months ago and was not all that impressed, but I have tried it a couple more times since that last review and I have to admit things have gotten a little better the service was always pretty good the waiting staff was always friendly and the restaurant is clean. they have a new system now where you can order your food and pay your bill right at your table if you choose to do so I thought this was very convenient   And from a security standpoint to your credit or debit card never leaves your hands. I still kind of have mixed feelings about this pay and or order at your table,but it is the sign of the times so I am trying to embrace this new idea at Applebee's I would definitely give this location I'll try things are getting a whole lot better especially during the lunch hour. Just goes to show things can improve with just a little effort. The new items on the menu are pretty good and to my surprise this time they did come out hot instead of just warm so give this location a try just as I did I gave them a second chance I don't think you'll be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

On my last visit my steak was cooked perfectly.  My food arrived so quickly I thought the server had made a mistake and was attempting to give me someone else's meal.  I was wrong and my food was great.

30,Lionel S.,"Grovetown, GA",0,9,2.0,2.0,2015-07-16,"The first time we went here, it recently opened (a few months or so) and we had a gift card.  Fortunately, we didn't have to pay for the experience. I was hoping that all the new store hiccups were settled but that hadn't happened quite yet. The second time we went my wife didn't want to stay because of what she saw while she was on her way to the restroom.  Apparently it was something nasty.  Note - she is not a stickler for cleanliness so I must have been bad.  Unfortunate...  Hope operations improve.  This could really be an awesome location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4?start=20,,,,,
15,Andrya D.,"Grovetown, GA",40,10,4.0,3.0,2015-08-16,"This is a standard Applebee's.  The decor is clean and staff was average.  Nothing makes this one stand out over the other ones.  It's convenient for us and it's my son's favorite chain.  I give the chain huge thumbs up for trying to actually upgrade their menu.  Everything I've tried off the new menu, such as the salsa verde nachos, maple bacon chicken piadini, clubhouse grill, sriracha shrimp, are all good...but nowhere near good for you.  I think their under 600 cal menu is seriously lacking in flavor and quality.   I'd like to see something healthy, in a decent portion size, that isn't a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4,,,,,
10,Ray P.,"Evans, GA",29,29,,2.0,2016-01-27,"It's an Applebee's, so expect what you'd expect at any other Applebee's. The service was just ok. At one point I had to flag down my server to get a refill on my drink. Nothing really stands out. My steak was ordered medium rare, and it came out medium-to-medium-well as usual. For some reason, no chain restaurant can cook a steam medium rare. Even when their menu has very distinct descriptions for what medium rare is supposed to look like, the over cook it every time.  I will say, they LOVE their air conditioning. That thing was on full blast and we literally stopped when we walked in the door from the arctic blast. We debated actually turning around and leaving it was so freakin cold. But, since we were there (and it was our first time at the ""new"" Applebee's) we went ahead and were seated. The entire time we were literally shivering. I looked around to see if we were under an AC vent, or had accidentally been seated in the freezer, but other than icicles hanging off the end of our table, nothing stood out to explain the arctic temperature. If you're looking for an Applebee's, this is one. Personally, I wish we had driven the extra 100 feet and gotten sandwiches at Jersey Mike's. That place is delicious and you dont need a parka while you wait. As a matter of fact, I'm gunna go review Jersey Mike's now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4,,,,,
26,Kadence B.,"Grovetown, GA",0,3,,1.0,2016-02-01,So a while ago I came here with my parents and the waitress we had was TERRIBLE. I don't remember her name but they should have fired her. After a while I came here again with my great granny and we saw that lady again and she was carrying plates. Now you might think that carrying plates can't really be messed up but it can. She had a little container with mustard or something that was yellow and it was spilling all down the row and my granny spotted it and told her about it. I really hope she doesn't work there any more. Also at this Applebees it seems like they pay attention to one side while the other is basically left in the dust. My dad said that next time we come here we are sitting on the side that gets more attention. We have never dat on that side and I'm ready to go back and writer a new review and hopefully it will be five stars. And I'm gonna guess that if when we go on the other side and if we still get terrible service we are never going there again. I love Applebees but they have terrible service.

13,Alex M.,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",27,7,1.0,2.0,2016-02-19,"Yesterday some friends and I went to Applebee's for dinner. Let's just say the dinning experience did not justify its cost. Walking through door we were greeted (well... actual we weren't even acknowledged at first) by lackluster hosts struggling to seat a few people in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress was thankfully an improvement but the kitchen staff weren't helping her out as the appetizers arrived with the main meals and the simple request for sauce on the side was not met (but she caught the mistake and sent the plate back). The overall atmosphere of the staff was rather unkept and needing some adult supervision. With other similar reviews of this place, I hope the levels will take notice to provide some emergency training. I don't want people to lose their jobs, but I be embarrassed to bring others there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-grovetown-4,,,,,

20,A M.,"Grovetown, GA",0,9,9.0,1.0,2016-08-12,Poor service. Been here about 3 times and it took forever to get the waiter to even acknowledge us.

8,Paris N.,"Evans, GA",84,89,136.0,2.0,2016-10-26,"Hmm.. Well. Its a chain. I shouldn't have expected much. I live out of state and never visit these sort of places but my family wanted to.  First off, I have a dairy allergy and I no longer eat meat. So this was a challenge here. The only thing I could eat was a salad. Oh yay! I could've stayed home for that. I asked for the Oriental salad with out shrimp. Nowhere on the menu did it say it had cheese in it. Well it did. But it was like thrown in, so not a lot. But I still has to pick it out. Or I would have been very sick.  Then our little waitress girl was nice, but kept forgetting everything. That's ok, she's probably new. But the people behind us got her extra care. That's fine. Places like this need to understand not everyone can eat dairy or likes to eat meat. Not one vegetarian or vegan option available. Never again will I visit this chain. And if I family wants to, I'll just go for the company.  Thanks for being like every other drone-like restaurant in the South.

The first two times our orders were messed up and the managers were nice enough to take the messed up food off the bill. Tonight however was a complete disaster. Our server, Nia, was not attentive at all and forgot to bring a water despite being asked twice. She stood and chatted with another table for over twenty minutes without checking on us, giving us refills, or checking on our food. Our food was barely warm when it reached the table a good 45 minutes after we ordered. My steak was way over cooked and when we asked to speak to a manager, she acted like she could care less. The one thing that saved our visit was we were given  a different server named Richard, who was fantastic. We have had him before and from now on, we will request him. He was great for the last 15 minutes of our visit and received a well deserved tip. My advice however is to stay away from this location. We were not even offered a slight discount for the terrible service and the subpar food.
