6,Julio H.,"Waukegan, IL",0,4,,2.0,2012-10-18,"Its not what it used to be, been to this location twice first time it was good second was like the wife said to cry. Service was nice but being a family restaurant i'm there  for the food unlike tilted kilt where your there for the"" ambiance"". Food was bad even the kids meal was bad, no flavor just salty food. I'm not picky when eating, should've just gone to golden corral where even though the food might be in the warmers for a while, at least I know there's variety without having to pay more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee,,,,,
7,Critic L.,"New York, NY",0,73,1.0,1.0,2013-02-01,"Food is decent but the entire staff are kids. Would have like to see a responsible adult. Ordered bottled wine only to be told later that the particular one is not available by bottle, picked another only to be informed that they ran out of wine glasses...has to ask twice for silverware while my starter sat cold in front of me.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee,,,,,
1,K P.,"Oak Park, IL",0,44,3.0,1.0,2014-09-19,"I am being generous when I give this Applebee's  one star. I came into establishment. No one waited on me for over 15 mins. On a Wed. night, it was not crowded How pathetic. Don't go there unless you are into poor treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee,,,,,
