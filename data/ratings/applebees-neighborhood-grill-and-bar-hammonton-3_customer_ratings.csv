7,Kristin A.,"Dixon, MO",7,34,29.0,5.0,2013-08-17,"Hubby, son and I stopped in here for dinner while in town and I must say everything was exceptional! It was seriously one of the best dining experiences ever. Our host was very nice, our server never missed a beat and the manager even walked around to tables offering her assistance that the servers might have missed. We ordered fiesta chicken, garden burger, appetizer of chips and salsa and even tried the ""blondie"" dessert. Everything was pretty good! I would def go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
8,Tameka J.,"Wyncote, PA",7,119,,1.0,2014-02-27,"I work in the area and was in desperate need of food options that weren't fried and/or covered in sugar. I have dined at this applebees more times than I care to admit. The first time I went in for lunch I was seated for 10 minutes and never received any sort of acknowledgement from the staff.  I left at the 15 minute mark, they probably didn't even notice or care.  A few months later I was desperate enough to try them again'  I decided to get the half sandwich and salad combo; the food was ok and I thought I could make them my go to place for a lunch time salad. I decided to use the curb side service. I was advised that my food would be ready !@ 12:30, it was not, they brought it tome 15 minutes later.  I returned to my office and my sandwich was soggy and the salad was wilted.  The geniuses at applebees think its ok to put a hot sandwich in the same container as a salad.  I called an advised them that I'd be returning the food for a full refund ( I'd taken a bite out of the sandwich) I was told by the manager that he was not authorized to give me a refund, I was completely taken aback ,I've never heard of such a thing. I was not in the mood for the drama so I let him know that since he couldn't help me, my next call would be to a consumer protection agency.  He quickly became authorized to give me a refund!!!!! When I went in for the refund they tried to short me out of my refund and I kindly let them know that they need to become familiar with their prices. Not returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
6,Christina N.,"Hammonton, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2015-03-18,Lastnites visit to Applebee's was very upsetting and disappointing say the least . My Family and I arrived at Applebee's we were not greeted by anyone for 5mins  the place was empty we stood in the door when the Manager came over from the bar to seat us . after that the waitress Came to take our order or so we thought but she was in the middle of taking our order and a group of her friends walked in she yelled to them hello then walked  away from us to give them all hugs and seated them My fiancé and I sat there in awe BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TAKING OUR ORDER mid conversation with her and we just couldn't believe she had walked away she went and totally forgot us she got their drinks and their silverware and we had nothing on our table except for our drinks I went and got the manager he did not come over right away after I explained to him what just happened she the waitress finally came over and asked if we were ready yet I explained to her we had been ready 15 mins ago I then asked if she realized she walked away from us as we were giving her our order she rolled her eyes and said I just went to say hi to a friend I was not that long I also explained to her it's unprofessional to walk away from a customer or her table she is waiting on that she at work ! She then stomped off  as she was being called away by her manager . They both stood in the back talking more like arguing her (waitress) more then him ( no respect for her manager at all it was clear)   he told her to go take the other people's (her friends) order  and he would find someone esle to take are of us after 20 mins of waiting my family and I got up and started to packing the kids up the manager finally came to the table and said he has another waitresses for us we declined because it took Him almost 30mins to approach our table with an sympathy or apology and the waitress was still at her friends table laughing enjoying her night while my family sat waiting and waiting very upsetting paid for our drink then we left I've lived in HAMMONTON for over 12years and these last 3years Applebee's has gone down their employee think it's their night club rather than their job I DONT THINK WE WILL EVER RETURN TO THIS APPLE BEES VERY UNFORTUNATE MY FAMILY HAS SPENT ALOT OF MONEY HERE ITS PERFECT PLACE WHEN U DONT WANT TO GO OUT OF TOWN BUT FOR BETTER SERVICE RESPECT AND PEACE OF MIND ILL TAKE A DRIVE !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
3,Kym B.,"Ocean City, NJ",45,183,41.0,1.0,2015-03-20,"Food tasted like it came out of a microwave.  Service was subpar.  Once was enough, won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
5,Mary Beth C.,"Atco, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-09,"They need to hire a new cook...ordered a plain 9oz steak ""Medium"", after waiting for over 30 minutes they bring me an  over cooked extremely ""well done"" steak, Mgr comes out and apologizes, going to bring me a new one that is Medium, comes out 15 minutes later,  the new steak is so rare the inside is not cooked at all, I could not cut it with their steak knife, in the meantime, my Husband had finished his steak, which was done correctly, they offered to bring me a 3rd steak, but I told them to just forget it, wasn't going to wait another 20+ minutes for them to try to get it right....PS coleslaw should be called Carrot Slaw, not good, skip it if you go...they took the appetizer off the bill, if you ask me, if you cant get a steak right in 2 tries dinner should be free...so it cost us $24 for a really bad experience.....needless to say, we will never go back.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
4,Randy W.,"Hammonton, NJ",0,3,,2.0,2016-05-29,Soldiers we don't go to Applebees very often when they advertise something new on the menu occasionally we will go and try it. However one of my favorite food is steak and if you want a good steak Applebee's is not the place to go to get it. I've been disappointed three or four times at the Applebee's in Hammonton the state has been replaced and the replacement is not any better than what was taken away. The service at the Applebee's on White Horse Pike is spotty sometimes your servers are attentive and other times they are annoyingly absent I usually have to grab another server to catch our server to get us our check. Although I only gave the review to Stars I would recommend most Applebee's for a decent dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,

2,Gavin S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,,5.0,2017-10-07,Ok I hated Applebee's for years but this location has amazing food and has 1 dollar margaritas for October.  Please visit Christina.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
0,Alesia Cohen S.,"Hammonton, NJ",6,9,,3.0,2017-12-29,"Food was very good, service was terrible. We were not in a rush but for a place that was barely 1/4 full it took forever to get fed. The dishes piled on the table never were removed even up to the paying of the check. Our server was not attentive but very very nice. Manager never came by and seemed, Not present at all. I hate to complain but could not understand what was wrong. Luckily we had good company and were not trying to set quickly and go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hammonton-3,,,,,
