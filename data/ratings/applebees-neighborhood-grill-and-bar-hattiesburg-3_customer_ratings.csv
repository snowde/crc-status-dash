14,Hope B.,"Southaven, MS",0,1,,5.0,2013-11-21,Ever since they got their new gm things have gotten sooo much better. I especially love the new weight watchers items. Also their happy hour specials are amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
12,Heather B.,"Pelham, AL",135,6,,2.0,2014-03-15,Mediocre food and terrible service. Tiny veggie portion w my steak. Sat here 10-15 mins w empty drinks even after asking other employees to find our server. Black n blue burger was awful. Chicken tenders overdone and dry. Ran out of Mr. Pibb.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,

8,Christie - Matt R.,"Houston, TX",8,32,4.0,1.0,2014-07-30,"Walked in and no one greeted me. Then grabbed a menu and sat myself and no recognition by any staff walking by for five minutes. Finally, someone asked if I'd had my drink order taken. Two minutes later my waitress showed up and said, what would you like? I said, salmon. She added, is that it? I added the French onion soup.  My Sam Adams ale then arrived. It was cloudy and tasted nothing like it should. However, the manager replaced it with another beer in their selection. My salmon arrived, not great but not bad either. Then my soup, simply okay there. As the last morsel of food entered my mouth the waitress returned, asking, everything okay baby?  This restaurant in desperate need of PR training, beyond the MOD, an Asian guy who sounded like Elvis they're sorely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
4,Tosh B.,"Hattiesburg, MS",2,31,7.0,3.0,2014-09-25,"Not very over the tops as chain restaurants go, did seem abit dim for lighting on the outskirts of the bar area. Ordered ribs and a large blue moon beer. Waitress was unsure of what was on draft . Wife ordered a margarita and it was served in a Tom Collins glass, very amateur bar tending their.  Overall I think it has opportunity to do better but lacks anything now that would tempt me to go their over chilis....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
10,Chris S.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,19,23.0,1.0,2015-04-26,They have small portions and high prices.i wasn't impressed.the spinach dip was very soupy almost thought it was soup when they brought it to the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
6,LeAnne W.,"Petal, MS",2,4,,2.0,2015-10-17,It's always hit or miss for this Applebees.... The service will be great and the food will be subpar or the staff will be off in their own worlds and the good will be GREAT but your treatment will leave a bad aftertaste. Maybe I'm just cynical? I don't know. But my trips here have been disappointing 7 out of 10 times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
7,Marlon M.,"Honolulu, HI",102,35,14.0,4.0,2016-02-07,"Our server Joseph was awesome, he knew the menu & suggested things to us, the food is always good especially the low carb meals. They are always switching up the menu with some great new items I love to try. The appetizers are always the best. Should come here more but only during daylight hours. It gets really rowdy & unorganized at night from my previous experiences. Love the drinks but not a fan of the night time atmosphere. I recommend lunch here, but thats good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
5,Janice M.,"Collins, MS",40,5,5.0,1.0,2016-04-16,There was a 10 minute way but only three other sets of individual were in there. Then once seated we waiting another 5+ minutes to order drinks. Finally when I got my food it was cold. To top it off we were seated across from some kids and one of the vomited in her plate. Worse experience ever. I won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
1,Ria L.,"Hattiesburg, MS",1,21,23.0,3.0,2016-05-10,"Average place for a decent taste food. We came here almost every week. Nothing disappointed so far. The restaurant atmosphere is good. The server/ waitress that we met were nice and friendly. The point is you need to know what you want, especially if you don't have adventures soul. Coz, their food may taste different from the picture on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
3,Master M.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,10,3.0,1.0,2016-10-11,This place has some of the most disappointing food I every had. I had a steak that tasted like fish and it just wasn't a good eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
2,Mike H.,"Petal, MS",0,1,1.0,3.0,2017-06-09,Service good. Food Good. Facilities could use some TLC with upholstery cleaning/replacement and wainscoting and baseboard cleaning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3,,,,,
