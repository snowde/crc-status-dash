We came on a Friday night and sat at the bar. We wanted to watch the Dodger game and we didn't know it but preseason football just started. UGH. So, we were thinking we probably won't be able to see the game since football overrules everything and we were going to leave once we finished eating. My hubby asked the bartender if they could put the Dodger game on and they said yeah not a problem! It just won't have sound and we didn't care about that. Yay! 1 star for just that. Drinks were made pretty good. And they always made sure we were good. For the food, I ordered the wedge salad and steak (special going on at the time) and it was delish! I wasn't expecting the best thing I've ever had and it surprised me by how tasty it was. Especially for Applebees. Bar is a little small so when football season starts and post season baseball is starting, I would probably watch baseball on any other day but Sunday or Monday or go somewhere else.  Great location right off Florida and close to the mall. They have a nice outdoor seating spot with misters!

It was one of those things where you take a bite then let it fall quickly out of your mouth. Experiencing emotions raging from Surprise, Disgust and Horror.  My son said you're being picky. Then he took a bite and his face was hysterical. While spitting repeatedly into a napkin he called the waitress over. She apologized and the manager came over and took my plate to the back.  The manager came back and said she was so sorry that was terrible and made the chef prepare a new plate (guess she tasted the other chicken breast we hadn't touched on the plate) but when the new order came it was just as bad.  Still I paid for it, boxed up the dinner and took it home, I was going to freeze it and send it off to the FDA to have it analyzed because I don't know what that was but it didn't taste like chicken. It was a cross between some type of waxed display food and pressed .......something. Got on the FDA website and it was too much of a hassle but I wish I had instead of tossing it in the trash.

I was starving and was planning on leaving to drive back to San Diego when one of my cousins mentioned he was ready for dinner too. I decided to stay and suggested some other places, but was outvoted and had to come here for dinner. I have been to other locations of Applebee's in San Diego and Riverside counties and was never thrilled with the menu, it was kind of meh. There wasn't much on this menu I liked, but the server was great and had a sense of humor. I think we all needed that since it had been such a depressing day. I did remember how good their fiesta lime chicken dish was the last time I had it. This time, it was an unusually big piece of chicken breast. The presentation was very nice and everything on the plate was good. I loved the lime flavor and the meal was pretty filling. I especially like the tortilla pieces in two different colors. They were crisp even with some of the sauce touching them. I liked the rice. It would have been nice to have beans too, but the breast was so big, I was full without them. The server was great in explaining some of the dishes and making suggestions. He even talked one of my cousins into the shrimp dish by telling him the number of shrimp he would get. My cousin was surprised since other restaurants don't give you that many shrimp in a main dish.  I would come back here again but it wouldn't be my first choice. The area here is not the greatest. We came here after 6pm on a Tuesday night and saw police activity twice on our way down Florida. It's too bad.

If you don't care about the cleanliness of a restaurant, go ahead, eat there.

15,Rita C.,"Hemet, CA",4,2,,1.0,2015-08-02,"If there was a zero option I would chose it. Went to this place for dinner with my daughter and grandson and the services was awful. I'm using awful as a polite choice of wording. First when we arrive the hostess says she will be with us and then we get ignored by the male hostess and her until another couple comes in and the male hostess almost seats them before us. Right before he seats them he looks at us only because my daughter is starring at him like what the hell dude. At that point the female hostess comes up and states she has a booth in the bar ready and my daughter tells her she does not want to take her 11month old son to the bar, and I mention no one wants to see a baby in the bar. Oh and she has the nerve to give my daughter attitude when she says no to taking her son into the bar to sit. WE then tell her there are plenty of open booths to sit at and the hostess then make up some excuse as to why we cannot be seated in there.  We finally get seated and our server comes and takes our drink order. My daughter got her lemonade beverage before my draft beer (which I wait over 20 mins for). Then he comes and takes our order. Now we arrived at 9pm and we left at 10pm. By 9:43 pm we asked a different employee where our food was. By the way I ordered a salad and my daughter got two appetizers. The people on either side of us got their meals while we were still waiting for our simple orders. When our waiter walked by he noticed us sitting there with no food and then asked us if there was something wrong. Well of course there was!!!! He then proceeds to ask us what we ordered again. So I thought that in order to be a good waiter you should remember what our tables ordered right. Well this man sucked at it. We told him that we wanted a manager, and ten minutes later she shows up. We try to tell her what happened and all she did was cut us off and says yeah I know I heard. Im putting a rush on your food.  At this point my daughter says lets leave. So we get up and walk out before getting our orders. I had a feeling that those meals were not going to be safe to eat. Oh and no one even noticed that we got up and left. We even walked right passed our waiter too.  After returning home we emailed their cooperate office and the email never even went thru.

The baked potato was good, and should have just kept it, and stopped there. But, the waitress was quite apologetic, and handled it like a pro. I asked for a small burger instead, which she brought 15 minutes after my husband had finished his dinner. The hamburger wasn't even very good. Actually, it was a sub par sad little burger with wilted lettuce, and a tiny end of a tomato for garnish. Patty was dry and just nothing special.  Nothing special at all. In and Out makes a waaaay better burger. I ate 3 of the fries, we paid, and left. Mind you, I LOVE FRIES, and NEVER LEAVE THEM ON THE PLATE.  I will say that our waitress was outstanding, very responsive, and apologetic. Not her fault. We still tipped her well, of course.  Probably won't go back anytime soon, if at all.

No seasoning on anything on my plate. I literally got 5 veggies. 3 were tomatoes.  Who df roasts tomatoes. The only reason I gave 2 stars was for Jeff. Very nice employee but I will not be eating at applebees anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hemet-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

43,Sandra G.,"San Jacinto, CA",71,3,,1.0,2016-12-07,"A month ago at Applebee's in Hemet, our waiter (David G.) He was discriminative towards my family and I (we being latino). Is no the firts time he do that to us he server us before and always is the same history so i decided to do this review ... was a white family in the booth next to us. He was polite and giving good service , but when it came to us he would wait a long time to get our drinks and bring a orders to us. David's attitude was always in a rush, when we were ordering our food he would tell us that they resturant didn't have this or that item yet the white family had order a few of the same items after us.  this waiter wouldn't even bring me a high chair for my nephew saying there is no room for it. Also my son ask for refill he say no to him  i'm sorry but the restaurants floor plan was already laid out for them to be used. we had a talk with his manager about his service and seen the manager talking to him about it and david just laugh it off. Being in the service industry myself I have never acted like that in all my time working because I know that my tips depend on the great service I give. I never do that but I didn't leave any tip to him I leave 20 dlls tip to the hoostes he was really nice with us! I'll not go back if that waiter is there! Horrible service.. I had other waiters there nice but that night he was the only one on the floor !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hemet-2?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

I can't believe it's a ""sports"" bar but they had transformers playing and the manager wouldn't change it to sports! The reason I gave it a 3 stars is that the bartender some what saved the night. She made it tolerable while transformers was on at a ""Bar"" . Next time I'll call in advance to see if they are having movie night!!!!

There were 2 other tables that were there so we ordered anyway. The waiter said the kitchen is going to close in 5 minutes so we had to hurry and order. I thought that was rude. We felt rushed. He hardly came by our table but was talking up a storm with the table next to us. They ran out of sauce for the mac&cheese chicken meal. I was already upset by how we were treated so I just didn't want anything. Then I ended up getting it with no sauce on the chicken. Took awhile to serve my husband his beer. He did offer more cheese for my mac&cheese because it looked dry. He always spoke really fast which was another reason we felt rushed. Food was good.

26,Cathy R.,"Murrieta, CA",42,10,1.0,1.0,2017-05-28,If I could give this particular store zero stars I would. We came in for dinner and we usually use the ordering system at the table. We got a 2 for $$ and when the food came out they didn't not bring our appetizer or other entree! When we informed our server Samantha she gave us attitude and said we only put an entree for our 2for$$.! To me that makes no sense because a 2for $$ comes with an appetizer and 2 entrees. Why would we order a 2for$$ and only order one entree.. Samantha handled the situation very poorly practically blaming us for the mistake saying we placed the order with out ordering the appetizer and second entree..the manager was no help at all either basically siding with the server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hemet-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

33,Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,150,443.0,1.0,2017-07-29,"I've only been to an Applebee's in Temecula maybe 12 yrs ago which was an ok experience for lunch with a friend. Then came the second event which was Mother's Day at the hemet applebees which was more like a Mother's Day meal from hell. Went with my mom and dad and teen. Waited over an hour for our table. The only good thing was the waitress who was fast and friendly. Everything else from the food presentation, portion size, flavors was the worst dining experience in recent memory for all of us. None of us ate our food and to include my father into that is pretty shocking. He cut one bite of his tiny minuscule overcooked piece of meat trying to pass for succulent steak, and put his fork down. The veggies weren't even worth it, absolutely nothing was. So we just asked for the check without eating. When the waitress saw the uneaten plates and asked if we wanted boxes she was shocked when I said we would not bring that nasty excuse for a meal with us. She got the supervisor who came over and tried to find out the problem. I listened and in very short but polite terms explained that it was the worst meal and the worst restaurant we had ever been to. He kept trying to utilize his customer service and pacifying 101, (useless on me since my education is clinical psychology and global MBA, I've studied human behavior and business relations for close to a decade) however I very calmly again explained that there was nothing he could do. We were not happy and our Mother's Day was already ruined after waiting over an hour for a horrible flavorless kid menu sized meal. I plainly told him to save his efforts because while I appreciated him trying to do his job I wasn't interested in any resolution. I didn't want a discount I didn't want a coupon, we would never ever ever set foot in an Applebee's again. After 10 minutes he gave up since I wasn't budging. I thanked him for being nice paid our Full bill, tipped the waitress 35% since it wasn't her fault and we ran as fast as we could out of there. Came straight home and made seafood and couscous and Greek feta salad and enjoyed our Mother's Day at home away from the tasteless pit that is Applebee's in hemet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hemet-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
