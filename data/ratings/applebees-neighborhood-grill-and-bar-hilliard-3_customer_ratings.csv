There's a variety of foods that you can choose from and plenty of alcoholic drinks you can choose from too. The decor seems to always be the same with the memorbilia on the walls. TVs are everywhere, especially close to the bar. You cant go wrong at this place.

28,Alan K.,"Hilliard, OH",1,18,,1.0,2012-06-26,I have literally been to hundreds of Applebee's....... No matter how many chances I give them - they continually let me down and it is never for the same reason.  One time food rocks and service is atrocious.  Other times food is weak and the service is great - etc... Why am I critiquing this one?  I live in Hillard.  Make no mistake about it though - this is intended for the entire chain!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
32,G B.,"Galloway, OH",0,2,,2.0,2012-10-21,husband and I went there for lunch on several occasions. Food is usually cold and service is terrible. We got the trios. I had the spinich dip. Ice cold.. My husband had the sliders and wings. His burgers were pink in the middle. He sent them back and they came out pink again. Finally we got the manager and he tried to take care of it. The burgers came out burned black. Apparently the chef thinks his mistakes are a joke. Have never been back and probably never will. The service is usually pretty slow. Took forever to get the check so we could leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

Well apparently we were not the only ones who wanted to eat out on a Wednesday, so it was kinda busy. Only about half the staff showed up on this cold snowing night. We waited longer for everything, to be sat, getting drinks, food, bill, you name it. I think we were there for a good 1.5 hours.  During the whole meal the staff was great and very apologetic and the mgr came by a couple of times to apologize and chat.  The food was tasty and we got our app for free do to the crazy wait for stuff. We didn't ask for free food or anything the MGR was giving free apps to everyone if they wanted it.

22,JB B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,21,,2.0,2013-05-05,"First time for this location.  Much fewer cars compared to other restaurants in the area.  Not busy - taken to a table which we did not like (one side in aisle) and we asked for a booth.  Seated in a section with dirty tables all around. This location is way overdue for a remodel.  The only thing that looked newer was the carpeting.  Looked and felt dirty, from the dingy low ceiling tiles to the dirty window sills, tables, seats.  Everything felt sticky.  The table cards and menus were gross - these should be wiped daily.  Service was average.  Food was slightly below average.  We don't eat out much and were really looking forward to dinner.  We chose Applebee's because we had always experienced good food in a good atmosphere.   Three in our party - mom got the fajitas and really enjoyed her meal - the steak was cooked perfectly, had good flavor and was seasoned as requested.  Hubby got a burger and fries.  The burger was burned (outside was black - asked for medium well) as were the fries.  He was really disappointed.  I got the half oriental chicken salad which was just okay - the lettuce was not very fresh and there was not much chicken - for almost $9 there should be a whole chicken breast. Applebee's as a whole has a great thing going - this location will be going away if it doesn't get its act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

31,Penelope C.,"Hilliard, OH",1,11,,1.0,2013-10-20,"So went there today...usually don't go there, but had been there a month ago late night and enjoyed the experience,  but to day the waitress was the worse I have ever encountered!!!!  1.  She took our drink orders but then walked past us with my daughters beverage in hand to talk to someone.  2. She did not give us any info about specials, but I did not realize it until I saw how much detail she provided to the guests who were seated on either side of us.  3.  Another waiter brought our food.  We asked for two condiments.  But we noticed we had no utensils.  When the original waitress comes back and asks how does it taste, I laughed and said, I don't know, we don't have utensils.  She said oh, right like you wouldn't  eat with your fingers.  But rather than get us utensils, she  proceeded to engage the customers at the table next to us.  We sat patiently. Finally, I got up and said could we please have some utensils.  She said in a minute, I have to go to the back and roll some.  But she xontinued to talk to the other customers.  I walked to the front door, grabbed two rolled sets of utensils and made it back to my booth, asking also to see the manager.  As I walked back to our booth with the utensils, she yells to some unknown being (we saw no one she was speaking to), ""never mind!""  The manager comes over wanting to know what the problem was.  I didn't want a scene but I quietly told him what was going on.  So he discounted up meals.  No big deal.  We were there to eat and pay, so a discount was not an issue.  But he seemed not to address her behavior, bc she routinely came back to our table...and here's the thing she was so nasty to us...could it be bc we are minorities?  Please don't let it be that, but the treatment she gave us was remarkable different than how she treated those around us who were not obvious minorities.  WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

13,Hannah V.,"Galloway, OH",25,14,2.0,2.0,2014-05-09,"I went here tonight with a couple girlfriends because we really enjoy their perfect margaritas. But tonight the food was less than mediocre. I ordered the Roma Steak Sirloin and it was horrible. There were no Roma tomatoes on the steak nor were the potatoes it came with seasoned. I ordered my steak rare and it was tough and chewy.  I've never sent my food back until tonight. The waitress was very sweet about it and so was the manager and they comped my meal. The only reason why I'm giving them a two is because I've now had multiple bad experiences with the food being absolutely not what I asked for. The Applebee's on Georgesville Road is much, much better. I'll be going there next time if I want my food cooked correctly.

10,Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",183,1934,1243.0,3.0,2014-08-27,"It's all about the ribs. Yeah, I saw a commercial about all-you-can-eat ribs.  So of course I was interested.  I've been to Applebee's before.  It's never my first choice, for barbecue or anything else.  But it's a decent place to go meet friends, and I've always had good service.  First time at this location, since I was running errands nearby and I had ribs on the brain.  I started off with the Asian sauce.  It was a little spicy, sweet, and tangy.  Thick but not running off the ribs.  Not sure what the appeal of ""crosscut"" ribs is; they are bony and a little annoying to eat.  But, I'm sure they're easier to cook.  Anyway, mine were done fairly well, and I chowed down.  Each order comes with slaw (meh) and ""barbecue-seasoned"" fries (well, I couldn't detect much seasoning besides salt, and the fries themselves were subpar.)   For my second order (hey, all-you-can-eat,) I tried the chipotle sauce.  No heat to speak of; a little smoky chipotle flavor.  Not bad, but definitely not my first choice.  The second order was smaller, which was cool.  I couldn't bring myself to place a third order.  The other sauce is their standard honey barbecue, which I've had and remember as alright. All in all, I'd go back.  It's a comfortable place,  Service was good. The food is decent.  I can't think of any negatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3,,,,,
30,Michael H.,"Columbus, OH",0,10,,1.0,2014-10-10,Horrible service. We were told there was a ten minute wait and were forgotten. We were then seated and forgotten.

9,Steve L.,"Hilliard, OH",16,5,2.0,1.0,2014-10-10,"I'm not one to leave reviews; however, I can't ignore it this time.  We've tried this applebee's on numerous occasions over the last 3-4 years.  In fact our last experience kept us from this location for over 2 years (even though we live 1 mile away).   Unacceptable wait (after sitting down we waited 45 minutes for food to arrive).  We were about ready to leave realizing that nothing had changed and then the food arrived so we forged ahead--bad mistake.  That's when the adventure began. My son's hamburger was actually a slider and some nasty yogurt (see picture).  Long story short, it came back twice and was still raw on the last time.   We explained to the waitress that we thought $5 was a bit excessive for a slider and some yogurt...she was quick to point out that that included the juice box!  Fantastic, i feel better now ;) Anyway my steak was microwaved too long (far cry from medium) and not sure what exactly that was on my wife's plate but it was supposed to be fiesta lime chicken w/rice.   Long story short, we got comped for the meal (definitely not desired but appreciated).  I appreciate them doing their part to make it right but in all honesty this restaurant, management, menu, food, specials is continuing down a path of mediocracy that we're unwilling to put up with since there are so many alternatives in the area.  I hope your experience(s) are better than ours have been.  We're done with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3,,,,,
24,Ron H.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,1,,1.0,2014-10-19,Terrible service - we asked the waitress what was taking so long with our appetizer order & she told us she didn't know... We suggested she go check in the kitchen & find out. She then eturned with our appitizer - go figure ! . Then we waited way to long for our main course & when we received the food it was cold. When we asked for a manager no one showed up. Needless to say we had a terrible expierenece as did every table around us. Until the manger figures out that this place is terrible I'm certain Applebees will continue to loose customers. Apparently this doesn't bother the staff at the Hilliard Applebees so I'll do my part & spread the word just how bad this place is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3?start=20,,,,,

Table and seats greasy.  Bathrooms smelled like urine and a dirty dish rag. My booth was just vacated by a family with small children - I had to clean the rest of the mess they left. I cleaned my seat with a (mildew smelling rag) I got from the hostess. Table greasy - needed cleaned. Was finished with our meal.........but leaving was the hard part. I gave the waitress a $100. took her almost 15 min to bring my change. We saw her chatting with the other staff and waiting on other tables while I'm waiting for my change.

6,Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",205,656,24.0,2.0,2015-11-26,"The service here is excellent.  Everything else is... ehh. You almost certainly know what this place is: a freakin' bastion of middle-America, a sort of chain restaurant in every sense of the word.  It's huge, it's filled with nice booths and television screens and iPads you order from, and there's ""The Big Bang Theory"" on TV.  This place is for cute little families that shop at Target and watch ABC Family or the Disney Channel or something.   The food here isn't cheap but isn't remarkably expensive, and it really fails to impress in any way - but that's not really anyone's fault.  I had the Bourbon Street Steak, which was basically their 9 oz steak doused in some sort of liquid and put on top of a few mushrooms and slivers of onion.  It was good - a bit overcooked in certain areas and desperately in need of whatever sauce was thrown on it - and simple.  The fries were good as well, though also inconsistently seasoned.  It was the kind of food that was good, but not exactly something I'd consider mind-blowing or even really a ""hit the spot"" sort of meal. The service here is surprisingly solid.  I didn't expect much for a location like this but was pleasantly surprised: the people here are genuinely nice and fast-working, even if the ultimate product is basic.  What I complain about is 100% unquestionably not their fault. In essence, this is exactly what you think it is.  If that's what you're in the mood for, go for it.

15,Brad S.,"Dublin, OH",1,30,1.0,2.0,2016-09-28,"Let me start by saying I have not been to Applebee's in about a year. Before that I came here very often, 2-3 times a week. A lot has changed here over the last couple years, most not to my liking. Applebee's has made a number of changes to the menu, food, and happy hour. In the past  I would leave work a little early to make sure I could get a seat at the bar. It was always a good crowd, good food, and a good value. I don't know what happen but everything changed. The food wasn't as good as it was before, servings were smaller, and with the constant change of happy hour you didn't know what you were walking into. So, after a few not so great experiences I stopped going to Applebee's.  It has been a long time so I figured I would try it again. Getting here around 5:30 the place was not busy at all, only one other couple sitting at the bar. It stayed that way the whole time I was there.  That was never the case in the past. The service was good but food was mediocre. Maybe in another year I will try again, if they are still here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hilliard-3,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

Someone hooked their phone up and started playing songs that included vulgarity and we was sitting next to senior citizens who sort of looked at each other a bit confused, which was sad honestly. My daughter asked for no tomatoes on her salad so when a waiter brought it out it and it had tomatoes on it, I told him and his response was ""oh man"" you want me to fix it ? You shouldn't have to ask first off because if she wanted tomatoes the first damn place she never would have said hold them back. I ordered Chicken Won-ton tacos and more than a few had minimal ingredients which was really pathetic. I come to this location because I've enjoyed the service over the years but there must be a change in management because this is 2 times in a row that the impression I have  is really unsatisfactory and I make no plans to return.
