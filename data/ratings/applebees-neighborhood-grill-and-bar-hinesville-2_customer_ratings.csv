15,Nancy H.,"Port St Lucie, FL",2,23,,3.0,2012-06-30,I am traveling to Jersey from Florida and stayed over night in Hinesville Ga .  Had dinner at Applebee's right in front of our hotel.  We sat at the bar and were greeted right away by bartender Lily.  Order our drink and she ask us for I.D.  I'm 60 years old and my husband is 62.  How about a little common sense!  Lily said it's company policy.  'Maybe Applebee's  needs to change that!  I.D. Up to 30 maybe but everyone???  On a positive note Lily was very friendly and helped me order my food ( dieting need healthy choices).

Previous experiences at other restaurants in this chain have been absolutely horrid - mostly substandard customer service and orders coming out wrong, cold, or both. We were reluctant to try this particular Applebee's out for that reason, but I have to say I've had pleasant experiences each time here in Hinesville. Waitresses have all been friendly - last time, my husband was happy to have ours wait for him to cut his steak in order to insure it had been cooked to order. Service has been prompt, but we've also never been there at peak dinner hours. My husband is a big fan of the Bourbon Street steak, and we both recommend the green bean crispers & brew pub pretzels.

And twice I walked back to the Fairfield Inn with angst in my heart because I should've known better. I should've listen to my gut, my mother, the little voice in my head....anyone or any past experience that has taught me that eating in chain restaurants in small towns is destined to result in unhappiness. First I tried a turkey sandwich with a caesar salad to go. It was supposed to have avocado on it but the avocado must have run away after it saw what I uncovered next... The salad's croutons. They were drowning in dressing and calling out for help but I couldn't save them. They sank to a soggy grave. Next I tried a steak with sautéed mushrooms and onions but to try that to go would surely be ludicrous so I copped a seat at the bar and waited on someone to take my order. I checked my email and then Facebook and then some other apps until my phone was almost dead. At the frightening realization that I was about to run out of ways to entertain myself, I started looking around frantically and asked that someone please take my order.  Several minutes later the steak arrived with the two cutest little mushrooms on it. They smiled at each other as I  devoured them to squash my hunger pains. The other veggies on the plate had died from heat stroke from being under the lamp for too long though. I tried to revive them with butter, salt, and then pepper but alas, it was too late. I placed them next to the remaining bits of overcooked steak and covered them all with a white paper napkin so no one else had to witness the gruesomeness of the crime scene. RIP.

34,Jennifer B.,"Midway, GA",84,3,,1.0,2015-08-16,"Hasn't improved. This was our first visit back in three years, due to the awful food from the last time. Sad to say, it hasn't changed. Don't bother with the sirloin steak in any form. Freezer burned, weird texture and never cooked properly. Very low grade quality of meat, for the price. One would get a better grade cut in the bargain bin at Walmart. Took 45 minutes to get our main dishes, then when they arrived, sides were on the wrong plates, steaks grossly overcooked. Dining room was dirty (food, straw wrappers, bits of napkin on the floor). Booth and table had a greasy feel to it. The only high point were the hostess and our server. Both were friendly, attentive and provided great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hinesville-2?start=20,1.84,1.84,1.84,2.148,1.8400000000000003

Strawberry Daiquiri?  really... the Bartender remixed 4 Strawberry Daiquiris trying to satisfy these two women... it was obvious after the 2nd drink that they were they for the free sample hors-d'oeuves and trying to swindle free drinks to go with them...

I've been to this particular establishment numerous times for lunch. I have come back for punishment to this place in hopes of new management/improvement, but alas, here I am...Officially throwing in the towel with this place.  On multiple visits food has been incorrect, bills not reflecting the appropriate amounts, and one time, our waitress even said after she messed something up, ""oh, I had a blonde moment"" (to which she was not blonde, however I am; therefore I did take offense to that). But this last time takes the cake.  My food came out after my entire group had already eaten, and paid their tabs. And when my food did come out, it was incorrect, and sent to the wrong table (by this point, I almost felt as this had to be on purpose or that I was being filmed). I spoke to the manager who was extremely rude about the entire situation.  Our entire group from work which has taken multiple parties there for work functions, will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hinesville-2,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Not bad, but, I really could not pick out any brew taste.  More like just a decent (in prepackaged terms) brown gravy. Recommend they only put gravy below the chicken in order to allow chicken and onion rings to stay crispy.  Husband had chicken tenders and sweet potato fries. Tenders nothing special and small.  Fries came with a unique dipping sauce.  Maple something or other.  Reminded me of cinnamon bun icing.  Place was clean.

The taste combination was interesting. I enjoyed it. The savory + spicy taste really hit the spot. My french fries were cold though. Also, the number of fries received was low. It wasn't justified by the prices they charge. I got the fried apple cheesecake for desert. It was tasty, but a little on the cold side. The caramel drizzle was a bit messy. It was sprinkled on the dish as if someone was rushing to do it, making it hard to really enjoy it. The stickiness ruined the experience.  I would recommend this location to anyone.

I liked that they have a tablet on the table where you can order and purchase your food. I was not a fan when I had to pay extra money to use the tablet to play games. It should be official. You order over $15 in drinks. You get to play games for free. Also, we need bigger portions. I'm a big woman and when I go out and drop coins. I like to eat. Better portions with the prices and you will get 5 stars. Other then that me and hubby will be dining here again. I will add that what made our night horrible, was the family sitting beside us that had a baby and she was completely naked. Like only had a diaper on, while these folks were dining. Like WTF.
