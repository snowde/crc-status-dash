Like bartender isnt experienced. Bartenders were talking too much and not noticing me. There were 4 bartenders and unorganized.

51,Brian S.,"Palm Desert, CA",1,34,15.0,1.0,2015-02-18,"We have been there 5 times since opening this was by far the worst customer service and restaurant experience we have had thus far. We sat and watched as 3 other people had service issues that were mishandled by the management on duty.  Basically, there was a drunk that had obviously been over served alcohol and was disruptive for everyone at the bar, she showed her breasts to the bartenders and all they did was laugh.  In addition, one customer complained about his portion size (he was accustomed to) in reference to the other local Applebees  and was told corporate has changed plates, there was a customer who asked if it was possible to steam an Asian style appetizer and was told they don't steam things (meanwhile steamed broccoli was served).  He said to us ""how do they steam the broccoli then, but can't steam pot-stickers""? Don't go to Indio Applebees if you are a military veteran unless you have your dog-tags or a tattoo to prove it.  The manager was so ignorant to even ask for such items and challenge the integrity of a proud military service member.  Only people with service related disabilities get ID cards.......I was refused a posted 20% discount all because I didn't have my dog-tags or a tattoo to prove it.  I don't even have a tattoo and my dog-tags are framed next to my honorable discharge!!!!!! Management was very aggressive towards guests with service complaints and not one single guest was accommodated for their legitimate food service  issues. The female manager stood in front of me and ruined my and my loved ones evening with her aggressive behavior regarding asking for a posted military discount. Don't go to the Indio Applebees if you want good service, and by all means don't expect anything if you have an issue with your food, drunk over served patrons, or posted discounts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-indio-2?start=40,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

I sat there with an empty glass and wet napkins in my table until food was served....still no Kelsey...thanks to Chanel that finally offered to refill my glass about 20 minutes later.

Ended up asking a hostess walking by to get us refills, extra napkins, and dipping sauces. And of course I was met with a sigh of discontent, and a rude comment because I was not patient enough to wait for my server. I was able to complain to a manager and all I got was an excuse about there policy on encouraging there servers to talk with their guests and disbelief that her hostess was disrespectful...

Manager wearing a leopard buttoned shirt, that their bowl of soup is measured by ""one ladle"". If that's the case than serve the one ladle serving of soup into a cup; for which would better suit it. And instead of this supervisor using her ability, since hey you hold the power to do so to fix the problem, I was given an ultimatum to take it or leave it. I guess giving me an additional half ladle serving of soup would just put this restaurant under. So, I had them remove my soup and salad from the bill and forgoed eating because I was upset over being given an ultimatum instead of a solution. Apparently, I'm not alone in my struggle to have good service at this Indio location,by the two star rating this restauraunt currently sustains.

I see the other bad reviews here, and please note that my experience, while not perfect, was certainly better than a one star experience.  A few points to note: Service:  Service, for a weekday evening, was very slow.  We were left alone for long stretches of time, especially when we got there and when we wanted to leave.  Luckily, the table top devices have games we could plan (which are generally lame, and some cost money - for 1991 level trivia games!).  If we could have ordered from the tabletop device and avoided having to wait for a server, that would have definitely made the experience better.  Applebees, I hope you're listening.  We appreciated that you could pay through the device, rather than wait for a server, but since we had a gift certificate, that didn't work for us.  Food:  Nothing exceptional here, but I actually liked the food.  Great portion sizes, great menu options, and since I have a picky 11 year old, I appreciate that there is food he likes here.

Then, things picked up and I was able to order a Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap and a Sam Adams. The pricing for the return on quality was steep. They also had tons of TV's but they were all playing replays of past events. I'd rather watch cartoons or CNN in lieu of that garbage.  The restroom was clean enough and the proximity for an afternoon trial was the best part. EXCEPT for that COLD BEER!

0,Robert G.,"Indio, CA",88,73,118.0,4.0,2017-08-12,Update!!!!!  Even a few months after my first few experiences here they only get more welcoming. I came on a Saturday night and we got sat right away in a kind of romantic corner lol jk. It was very relaxed with low lighting which was welcoming and our server was a great ice breaker making us feel even more welcomed. I usually get the artichoke and mozzarella sticks munch on while I enjoy a drink (very rare). The blue Hawaii was a bit strong but then again I drink no more than 7 days a year so everything taste strong to me.  This time the food came faster to us and was a little cold so they may have pre made the food a little to early. Minus one star for that. If I was buzzed it would have been okay but I wasn't yet Thank Tara for the welcoming vibe and hospitality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-indio-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

Literally 8 to 10 tables in the whole restaurant! Got sat for 2 & didn't get waited on until 10 minutes after out arrival. I was ready to get up & go to another location but by the time I would have got to the one in Palm Desert the happy hour would have been over. As we were waiting the servers were just standing around talking and one, who ended up being our server, went out of her way to mention that she was supposed to be on break & that's why it took so long for us to be greeted. I didn't leave a tip I was so upset. I'm a server so I know the drill. I will NEVER return to this location again...

The burger was slightly undercooked even though we asked for fully cooked patty so we only could eat half. Pasta was good & fish & chips were ok, nothing special. Considering the price of the plates and the food quality I would say it was overpriced. The strawberry lemonade was yummy with real fruit. Not amazed by this place and probably would not return. While the ambiance was nice it was not enough to make up for the meh food which left us a bit undersatisfied.
