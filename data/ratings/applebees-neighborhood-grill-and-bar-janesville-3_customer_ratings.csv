11,Jeff P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,28,8.0,1.0,2012-07-15,A completely worthless restaurant. I'm not sure I've heard of a grill/bar restaurant that doesn't serve chicken sandwiches. Aside from that... the food quality is just... blah,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
7,Courtney L.,"Chicago, IL",4,15,1.0,2.0,2013-11-24,"Stopped in last night to check out the redesigned restaurant.  Our waitress was very inattentive. She stopped back only twice. She only had two our three tables and they were not very busy. The food we ordered came up pretty quickly, and it was very delicious. When we were finished however, we had to wait a long time for the bill. We waited even longer for her to come and cash us out. She was standing by the computer picking stuff out of her ears. She then sent a different waitress to pick up our bill and cash it out. I doubt we will ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
10,Matthew G.,"Janesville, WI",4,47,1.0,4.0,2014-03-17,"hopefully the negative reviews here are based solely on actually experiences and not just people that are desperate to complain. I mean, one of the reviews here is from someone whining that they don't have chicken sandwiches! really? go to mcdonalds, they have all the chicken sandwiches you could ask for! and some people just can't find anything nice to say about chain restaurants. then again, maybe we all just have different opinions... well, here's mine: this place is good. seriously good. a friend of mine and I were talking about applebees, and how we never really think about it as being a really good place to eat, yet whenever we eat here, we love it! I have not had a single bad experience here, just the opposite, I am always extremely happy eating here. the service is always very good, very friendly and attentive. and the food is always surprisingly good. the fiesta lime chicken and citrus lime sirloin are two of my favorite dishes, and the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer is also delicious. and the chili is also some of the best I've had in a restaurant, they'll throw in some jalapenos if you want a little heat. and the ""2 for $20"" deal is enough reason to get you in the door. on average, the entrees you get to pick from cost around $13 or $14 if purchased separately, so not only are you saving some money right there, but you also get an appetizer thrown in as well. seriously, I have no idea where all the complaints come from. the only reason I took away one star is that I feel the portions are a little small. then again, it could just be that I'm enjoying the food so much, and hate when it's all gone! now, if only they had chicken sandwiches....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
9,Jess H.,"Shawano, WI",96,29,1.0,3.0,2014-03-29,"I ate here when I was in Janesville on a business trip. The fish fry was ok, but nothing special. I was seated at the bar (my choice) as soon as I walked in, an the bartender quickly got my drink and food order. She even refilled my soda when it started getting low.    I had no issues with this particular restaurant, but Applebees isn't usually my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
3,Michelle W.,"Minneapolis, MN",39,47,56.0,1.0,2014-08-31,Stopped after shopping with my mom. Absolutely starving. Waiter seemed nice and food came quickly. That's where the good ended. A medium steak came well done and the broccoli was a joke...2 HUGE stalks that almost took longer to cut than eat and it was undercooked. Waiter never asked how things were. Mom liked her honey BBQ ribs but the fries were way too spicy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
8,Henry N.,"Evansville, WI",1,7,1.0,1.0,2014-11-02,Wow where do I began. We are locals. And decided to give Applebee's one more chance. What a mistake. After being seated we waited for 15 min for a server. Very lazy and slow workers there. And she wasn't even assigned to our table. Ignored by other servers. Finally we just left. Because we were parched with thirst. And table was sticky and dirty. Will never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
6,Dr Don S.,"Algonquin, IL",9,82,33.0,4.0,2015-05-26,Stopped here to meet some friends. We had the luncheon specials. Both my wife and I enjoyed our meals. Surprisingly my sandwich and salad  were very tasty. Our server was always there when we needed her. Will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
5,J.R. A.,"Janesville, WI",21,27,42.0,5.0,2015-07-31,"We've come here at least a half dozen times over the past year and have never had bad or even mediocre service. Wait staff is always attentive and very pleasant and the food is too notch for chain restaurant/bar fair. We don't expect Cordon Bleu quality but we are always pleased with what we do get. We like going on Mondays for burger night (everry burger is $6.99, which can be nearly half price). We also like to just order a bunch of appetizers instead of a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
2,Todd Q.,"Janesville, WI",25,30,13.0,1.0,2015-08-27,Bartender was rude!! Don't waste your money. Our first time back since the remodel. Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
4,Jordan K.,"Janesville, WI",0,30,,3.0,2015-10-17,"Applebees has always been hit or miss for me. Sometimes I've gone there and the meal has been extraordinary and I'm quite satisfied. However, there have been other times when the food is terrible and prepared poorly. It's a bit of a coin, honestly. I don't go here often for this reason. The staff has always been kind and attentive. Overall, you're probably better off going somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
0,Alycia M.,"Janesville, WI",30,6,,3.0,2016-05-09,"A little disappointed in service this time a round- but they do seem to have good and bad days.  Went for lunch and sat for 15 minutes before we had drinks.  Was 45 minutes before we got our food.  For lunch- this is way too long for service- even dinner that really isn't acceptable.  I've never gone over lunch before, so not sure I will go back at lunch time.  Food was fine.  I gave 3 stars since I can't give 2 1/2- it is 50/50 on if you get a good day or a bad day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
1,Jason T.,"Janesville, WI",0,5,,1.0,2017-10-17,"We arrived after the lunch rush at 1pm and the restaurant was less than half full. We were promptly seated at a table in a section that appeared no busier than the rest of the place. However after fifteen minutes of waiting for anyone to acknowledge us, we left. My wife reminded me why we don't go there and it's always service issues like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-janesville-3,,,,,
