4,Brian B.,"Joliet, IL",27,14,,1.0,2013-07-29,"I am writing this review from my phone in the restaurant. It took 15 minutes to get drinks, 20 minutes for a food runner to bring wings and forget the ranch. Another 2 minute wait. Ordered a margarita since they were only $4.00. It tasted like salty like kool-aid. Probably the worst one I've ever put in my lips.   The steaks were either over or under cooked. Both ordered medium.  Baked potato was under cooked. Mashed potatoes really really lumpy.  Veggies have been steaming for a week. Ordered green beans and were told they weren't fresh and couldn't serve, honestly all the veggies tasted old as heck.  Haven't been to this location in a number of years due to bad service of the servers always being outside smoking when I needed refills.  The server we had on our visit was really nice and tried super hard... When he was at our table versus a food runner who just screwed everything up! He totally got a 20% tip even though he only did 50% of the actual work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

8,Darrin S.,"Joliet, IL",0,13,,2.0,2014-12-22,"Tried this place again after staying away as a result of bad service. Should have stayed away. Music was so loud we had to basically scream to talk at our table. It was dinner hour. Music should not have been that loud. Watched the bartender pick up glasses by placing fingers inside the rim. Decided not to get a drink. Server tried hard, but food took forever and half was cool by the time it made it to our table. Apps were the only saving grace. They were good, on-time and a decent price. Go for the apps, but find somewhere else for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,1.544,1.544,1.544,1.544,1.544

29,Brian D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",40,32,27.0,1.0,2015-02-26,"This review isnt for applebees corporation,  just about this location.  My first visit i found some type of wire in my chicken salad. I mentioned it to server and they shrugged if off and asked if I wanted something else. Not a pleasant experience.  My second visit was during a cold wave and i just wanted to have a beer and an appetizer. I elected to dine at the bar area and the bartender on duty was visibly angry about this . She didnt want to serve my friend and I because she was busy cleaning or she had a bad day or whatever. Completely rude. She argued with the manager in front of me about taking care of us. My friend and I simply left.  There is another location nearby on route 30. I highly reccomend that location instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,,,,,
6,Sarah H.,"Joliet, IL",0,9,,1.0,2015-04-19,"The food was very good but our waitress was either untrained or slightly unstable. There are too many people just wandering around not communicating with each other. The food was hot and tasty but we had to keep flagging down the waitress several times. Even then she did not bring us what we asked, we still had to ask for other servers. We had a party of 4 and they brought out half the food over 20 minutes apart. I like Applebees but this location sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,,,,,
3,La La R.,"Joliet, IL",9,16,2.0,1.0,2015-08-19,Went to this Applebee's with my husband and the experience was not good as usual. It's a neighborhood restaurant that we patronage sometimes. This time I wish I would've went with my first mind and went somewhere else. Ordered the shrimp and it was overcooked and the fries were also. The manager said they were short a com and that was obvious. He compensated half of the bill though. I don't know if I'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,,,,,
30,Matt C.,"Minooka, IL",0,4,,1.0,2015-12-31,"I am officially done giving this place a chance. We have been here about 4 times in the last year and the service has been unbelievably slow everytime. The slow waitstaff is ridiculous. They spend most of there time standing around talking with each other and move like snails for the customer. I never saw a manager so maybe that's the problem. Take my warning, go somewhere else, it's just not worth the aggravation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,,,,,

The Oriental Chicken salad is really good, and the Mac n Cheese with Honey Chicken and Bacon is unbelievable.  My family will order that as it's too rich for me, and no one can eat the whole thing. I also love the  Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken. Great for Weight Watchers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,,,,,
1,Chris C.,"Wilmington, IL",1,62,8.0,1.0,2016-04-28,"They were late opening the doors this morning, but when I entered, there were already people seated with drinks.  I sat at the bar and told the bartender I wanted to order food for carryout.  They yelled at someone to get me a menu and then went to sit with the people already there to loudly talk and make a phone call.  I was never asked if I wanted a drink.  I waited for someone to come take my order and finally just left.  There was plenty of staff there and I was the only customer, besides the bartender's friends, so not sure what the issue was.  It used to be that I could get a menu from the bartender, order a drink and when they came with my drink, I could order food.  I guess now one person takes drink orders if their friends aren't there, one gets a menu and one comes for your order.  Inconsistent service seems to be a hallmark of Applebee's in general.  They need to run a tighter ship.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,,,,,

0,Diana S.,"Joliet, IL",0,4,1.0,2.0,2016-07-22,"Well where do I start my daughters brought me here for my birthday and it was a very bad experience.  First thing it took a half hour just to get something to drink, then it took an hour for the food.  We only ordered burgers and fries how long does it take for that. The place was not busy either I should have went to McDonald's I would have gotten my food faster. The waiter did try his best, but it seems that he just had to many tables with little amount of people present.  From this point the way the manager handled the situation I will just make the restaurant on Plainfield road my choice to go.!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5?start=20,,,,,

They have a tablet that you can play with while waiting. We tried a couple of games which were very simple. I thought they were for kids play. And when I got my bill, there was a charge of those games too!! I complained to the server. She took the games' charge out.

26,Scott A.,"Joliet, IL",2,2,,1.0,2016-11-09,"The service was very slow. I've been here a few times over the last few years and it seems to be getting worse everytime. The workers seem nice enough and are polite but very frazzled. They seem to be under staffed and everytime I've come it's a new waitress, so their turn around is fast. Especially this last time my while order took very long and the food came out cold.

19,B W.,"Plainfield, IL",4,371,,1.0,2017-02-10,"Slow, awful service, food was just as bad-I love salmon and eat healthy.  I was happy to see some healthy items on the menu.  Salmon, first was dry and overcooked.  Horrible.  Maple glazed?  What nothing on the salmon.  I ordered the wood grilled veggies and baked potato.   Grilled veggies were okay, not really a serving.  The baked potato was undercooked and awful.   I would never go back, meeting a friend who wanted to go there.  The waitresses and workers were awful.  I couldn't begin to tell you as it was at most tables.  Manager needs to work on better service and take a look at the awful food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,,,,,
14,Jen M.,"Joliet, IL",36,96,81.0,2.0,2017-03-24,"Came in for lunch one afternoon just before the rush. Staff was friendly. Our server was attentive  and timely. Our order was correct. The food is what it is; it's Applebee's.  Really I'm dinging them hard on one thing. We were sat in the lower bar area where there is a step up into the booths. I had my 2 year old with me. They brought two high chairs stacked on each other so that he would be able to reach the table. I (stupidly) figured that was how the chairs are made- that this is an optional configuration. It absolutely is not. While yes my son was able to reach the table, midway through his meal he leaned forward (there was a 1-2"" gap between his chair and the table) and the top chair slid off center and was leaning against the table. I fixed it and noticed a table nearby had a much younger child in a similar highchair set up whose chair had also slid out of place. For whatever reason the adults with this child didn't fix it and spent their meal holding it in place with one hand as it leaned against the table.  Of course, since he is 2, my son leaned forward again (nothing crazy, he was reaching for something on his plate in front of him) and it came out of place again. I adjusted it and while I was doing this the server came over to see how things were and mentioned she had a table once who had a baby sitting in the same setup and the baby was screaming. Screaming and face was red and was just agitated. For whatever reason the parents were ignoring the child (*facepalm*) and the server looked closer and saw the top chair had slid out of place and the baby's leg was stuck between the two chairs. Needless to say I removed my kid and put him in the booth next to me.  We did not ask to be seated in this area. The lower tables on the upper area were empty. We told the girl who seated us we needed a highchair when she asked how many (my kid is still too wiggly to handle a booster). If a kid's leg is getting stuck (I'm guessing not the first) why on earth are the staff continuing to set the chairs up like that? Evidently they were not made to be used that way. And if they were, the chairs suck and need to be repaired or replaced. There are high top high chairs available- I know because Hooters has them. Restaurants have declined to seat us at high top tables as their high chairs didn't reach. I searched online to see if chairs existed that allow for them to be used in this manner- they don't. Chairs I found similar to the ones here mention nothing about the ability to be used this way.  I assume my responsibility for naively trusting the staff to know how their equipment works. They use it every day. But they're obviously using it incorrectly or not maintaining their equipment to work properly. There is no logical reason why we, or the other table, were seated in this area. I'd rather wait longer for an appropriate table if it means my child will be safe.  And parents- for pete's sake, regardless of the reason why your kid is crying in a restaurant, handle your business. Don't ignore them- on the minor side they could be irritating other patrons and at the more exigent side they could be in actual physical distress. Like their leg being caught in an improperly used high chair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,,,,,
21,Kathy M.,"Joliet, IL",15,5,,2.0,2017-05-10,The service is so slow. It took over 10 minutes to get water and a glass of wine and took over 30 minutes to get our meal.

23,Deborah P.,"Joliet, IL",0,29,8.0,2.0,2017-06-25,The place is clean and very convenient but the lack of service is unbelievable. We have been here after 9pm many times and while they sit you quickly enough no one waits on you. It took over 10 mins to get water and that was after asking twice for a waitress and there were only 6 tables with people. The girl that showed up was great but she was handling tables across the room too. Not sure if the manager goes home at 8 but to wait another 20 mins for your dressing after the salad has showed up is ridiculous. What is going on in the back/kitchen?  Staff is nice but no one is in charge. Food was good and hot but a 45 minute turnaround time is ridiculous. It got busy after we left them people are probably still sitting there waiting for their food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-joliet-5,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

25,Bill H.,"Plainfield, IL",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-08-16,"Well we had a order of nachos a bowl of  french onion soup and a chicken Caesar salad which took an hour and 45 minutes at first my soup came out cold the waitress said she would get me another one in the meantime my salad came and the nachos came the soup was last thing I had to eat since we were pretty much done with our meal. We ordered a Nachos without jalapenos but we found out later that it had jalapenos on it underneath the ground beef? We think it was ground beef anyway, my wife decided just to pick out the jalapenos so we don't have to wait much longer. The waitress said she was not going to charge me for the soup but when the bill came from another waitress of course it was on there, so we waited for our waitress to come back which never happened finally flag down the manager and he took it off the bill, I seen two other orders being returned back to the kitchen because they were wrong or undercooked the restaurant was not even half full, so I pretty much wasted my $25 gift certificate that I got for my birthday.

The wife ordered a combo that included a chicken wrap.  After she ate about 1/2 it seemed that there wasn't any chicken in there, so we took it apart and found 2 small pieces in there, so that was a bust.
