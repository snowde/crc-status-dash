266,Richard L.,"Honolulu, HI",134,53,36.0,2.0,2017-04-13,"Nice location and just opened. Atmosphere was nice. Music was too loud. Staff were very friendly and outgoing, at the same time, staff trying too hard to be nice that it felt uncomfortable at some point. Me and my family's first time in a Applebee's ever. Unfortunately for this location, the wait to get our food took a lil over 30 minutes and it was not a busy night. Coffee was watery. My kids ordered steak and it tasted like tendered steak and over-cooked. I order the best signature dish on the menu which was the pork chop and I was not satisfied with this supposedly signature dish. The only thing that I can think of of why they called it a signature dish is because of their apple sauce on the porkchop. But there was nothing spectacular about it taste wise and my green beans tasted watery...seemed like they boiled it in hot water and just throw bits of soggy bacon and bits of garlic...thought it was a half a** job and my loaded potatoes (which cost more according to the waitress) was not even loaded...another half a** job. Simple dish but the quality was half a**.  I think this location needs a better chef. Simple dish and was seemed to be done half a** or rushed when the place was not even packed. Never again. I thought it would be different from Chilis, Outback, and Ruby Tuesday but it's all the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=300,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

77,Tracy A.,"Waipahu, HI",3,25,21.0,3.0,2017-04-14,"Overall I'm giving this location 3 stars not because it just opened earlier this week but because the food that my bf & I ordered didn't come out that great. The wait to get seated was super fast! I would've thought that since this location just opened they'd be packed with people waiting outside but there wasn't. We were brought to a table in the back but the table wasn't even cleaned yet so I asked to be seated at a booth since they had to still clean the original table we were to be seated at. The booth me & my bf sat at was also NOT CLEANED yet but it was pretty minimal so our host had to tell one of the waitresses to just wipe the table. I would give the wait time to be seated a 4 star.  Our waitress' name was Mal & she was very sweet. She took our appetizer order & it came out within a good 5 minutes of ordering. As for our main dish, we waited a good 45 minutes for our food, then Mal came to tell us that they were out of the baked potato & that's why it was taking long for our food to come. Honestly if the cooks knew they were out of potato then we should've been told @ the 10-15 minute mark, not @ 45 mins. We got to the place @ 6:30 PM & we literally received our food @ 8:00 PM. Total fail Applebees. My bf & I ordered the 8oz steak - when the food came there was a total difference in the sizes. My steak actually looked like an 8oz, whereas my bf's steak looked waaaaaay smaller. We ended up complaining to what looked like the manager. I didn't get her name but she was wearing a light blue collared shirt. My bf asked her what size does she think his steak was, laughed in disgust & said ""that's a 6oz but it really looks like a 4oz steak"". She offered to have another 8oz steak made so my bf said ""OK"". After that my bf didn't even want to eat his food because his mac & cheese with bacon was actually hard & almost cold. We waited another 15 minutes for his 8oz steak to come out but it was nowhere to be found so we asked for our check then left. Overall food rate is 3 because our appetizer, it was called ""The Combo"" was very fulfilling. Maybe next time I come here, maybe in 6 months to a year, they'll be more consistent with the food & all but for now I'm gonna stay away from Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=60,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
294,Paige B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,1.0,2017-04-14,Waited over an 1 1/2 hours for food. The place was practically empty. Other tables were gettting their food. Don't go here when your starving.

171,Stephanie C.,"Honolulu, HI",58,6,15.0,3.0,2017-04-15,"The rating should be 3.5 stars just because service was great. Located in the Ka Makana Ali'i shopping center. Our server was attentive, refilling waters and answering any questions we had about the menu. She even offered us lemon in our water. We ordered the chicken wonton tacos for an appetizer. It was pretty good. The description said it was tangy chicken but I thought it tasted more sweet than tangy. For our entrees we shared the spinach artichoke chicken cavatappi and the southwestern steak salad. The pasta tasted like spinach artichoke dip on pasta, but it was cheesy and delicious. The grilled chicken was yummy too. The steak salad was meh. The picture on the menu made it look so good! The steak was hard and overcooked. I let the waitress know and she asked if we wanted a new salad or something different. I asked them to make grilled chicken instead. They brought it our promptly and I felt like that made up for the steak error. Overall, service was great, food was okay.

292,Alexis C.,"Mililani, HI",0,1,,2.0,2017-04-15,"My family and I just left the establishment and our experience wasn't a great one.  The inside is very nice and clean and appealing to the eye but the service and food wasn't so great. We ordered the 2 for $25. They brought our appetizer out and gave it to the table behind us. That table had literally been seated for maybe 5 minutes and received our appetizer when we had already been there for about 15-20 minutes.  Our waiter took forever to come and check on us and when they finally did, we told them that we thought that our appetizer was given to someone else. They went back to check if that is what happened and yes, that's definitely what had happened. We eventually got our appetizer which wasn't even that great.  When they were bringing our entrees out, yet again, they gave our food to the SAME wrong table. This time the other table spoke up and said that that was not what they ordered, which is when I cut in and said that that was our food. The waiter then told us that they were going to take our food back and bring us ""fresh plates."" My husbands food was cold, and so was my daughters. Thankfully mine was not but for having to wait that long, and having them mess up more than once, their food should not have been cold.  We didn't tell them that the food was cold because by then we were all starving and decided to just eat our meals. They apologized but didn't try to compensate us in anyway.  Mediocre food and not so good service. I understand they just opened but servers should at least know which table is which. It's their job and if they don't feel confident in doing it correctly then maybe they need more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=220,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

Our waitress Sylvia was slow, could not be found, never came around to fill water or ask if everything's okay and didn't even apologize for the extremely long wait.

134,Emilee P.,"Kapolei, HI",17,26,20.0,3.0,2017-04-16,"This is the new Applebee's location at Ka Makana Ali'i. I haven't been to an Applebee's in about 10 years and it's changed a lot from what I remember. The decor is very minimal. The entrance is somewhat crowded- it seems like that area was badly planned. There is only room for about 4-6 people to sit and wait, otherwise you have to go outside. They currently have no benches outside so you just have to stand around. (Edit: I checked again and yes there is one bench) Come in the evening so you're not standing in the hot sun. The server greeted us almost immediately and we got drinks and an appetizer with no problem. The main entree was a bit of a wait but they are in their first few days of being open, so I understand that they're figuring out the timing with the kitchen. No complaints with the food or server. I thought the music was a little loud because I couldn't hear people at my table at times. I would give it overall a 3.5 for now, and will visit again in a couple months. UNFORTUNATELY we were seated near a table full of a******s. These people were absolutely ridiculous. I felt so bad for the server. If you go to a brand new restaurant within the first week of opening, you should expect there to be small issues in timing or wrong orders. Whatever, let them know and they will fix it. Here's what NOT to do: snap at the wait staff like they are dogs, yell across the entire restaurant for a manager, walk into the kitchen, yell obscene things when families with small children are nearby, oh and walk out of the restaurant without paying after you have received drinks and appetizers. Advice: it's a brand new place figuring out their flow and timing. If you want everything to be 100% then wait to visit for a while. If you're going to be a total jerk to everyone, stay home. Otherwise check it out and if you feel like it, give constructive criticism on things they can fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=140,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

And since I was ordering the four cheese macaroni with chicken tenders with spicy dipping sauce,I wanted it without the spicy dipping sauce. When we finally got our food about 40 to 45 minutes later when I went to eat the Mac an cheese I discovered that it was spicy my mom bought it to the servers attention server said well they might have used pepper jack cheese, I was very upset by this especially since the waitress was let known that I was severely allergic to spices. She did take my plate back to the kitchen and about 25 to 30 minutes later my other meal that I ordered of chicken tenders and french fries was bought out. My mom was also unsatisfied with her order because it was heavily coated in a beer gravy and you could tell that the alcohol was not completely cooked out of it also my brothers burger was very dry. When the waitress came up to take the plates and give me a to go box she had asked him about his burger and asked if it was crappy since he had only taken 2 bites from it an didn't want a box for it to which he said yes to. Our waitress was really nice and had no issue with taking the stuff back and seemed to understand that the food wasn't good at all I am upset though with the fact I could have had a serious allergic reaction tonight because the waitress didn't seem to know all the ingredients in the mac an cheese or ask the cook.

Ordered some food, came out and was almost delivered to the wrong person. I claimed the food as mine and it was set down. Food was good, hot, well prepared. About 1/2 way through my pupus the bartender asked if I wanted anything else, I put in for dessert. It literally took 20+ minutes to put together a brownie on a hot plate with a scoop of ice cream, and when it came out, it didn't even have the cream cheese topping. The bartender added it from a solo cup after the fact. I've ate at a lot of Applebee's over the years...this one is not only overpriced ($13 bucks for 6 boneless wings and 5 shrimp?) but the back house is too slow. Friendly servers, good food (although, crazy small portions) - I personally won't be back, but I'm sure it'll be a good fit for many, considering Applebees is new to the island.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=140,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.152,2.92
185,John P.,"Waipahu, HI",140,2,,2.0,2017-04-23,"Wait time around 5p was 45 min which we waited, then 20 min more. Host apologized and escorted us to our seating which was occupied by employees that seem did not to get the communication that was our seats. Atmosphere was filled with a bunch of ""sorry's"" for mistake orders or long waits. There were empty tables which gave me the impression they were understaffed. Now the food was great, but the timing of the food coming out made it a horrible first experience. I asked the waitress what is wrong and she just apologized. We ordered a trio sampler but only received two. We inquired about the third appetizer and on multiple accounts they gave us different reasons.  Finally our food arrives all at once except for my friend's salad. Now I am eating my Soup along with my entree, which does not make sense.  Then we asked about the sour cream and butter for a baked potato and the waitress informed us that it was being prepared. Manager comes over and delivers the salad and the rest of us were finishing up eating. The salad was made wrong. Which now we made it to go. At this point we felt neglected by the waitress and trainer because of the amount of mistakes made. The manager then comped the entire meal. I told her I didn't want that and that I get that they just opened and people are being developed but they need to tighten up in their communication and teamwork. Our neigboring table had steak cooking level issues.  I can go on about more mistakes but i think you get my drift on my experience. So a free meal to compensate the horrible experience was a nice gesture but will give a second chance because the food is good.

Managers slouching over the counters talking story. When it came to ordering food two of us ordered 8 oz sirloin. They were out of Loaded Baked Potato for sides. 5 minutes later water comes to ask one of us that they're out of 8 oz if we're ok with gettin a 6 oz. apparently she thought only one of us got a 6 oz. We also ordered Cesar salad. When the salad came it was House Salad. We had to tell the runner that we ordered Cesar Salad. Then our waiter came back with it saying they ran out of Cesar Salad. Entree's took almost an hour to come out. Not once during this waiting period did the waiter or manager come to apologize for the wait time. Before we left we did ask if the lady slouching on the counters was a manager and we were told that she was a trainer. In between she was also watching the TV's here and there too. Shouldn't a trainer be watching the employees? Don't think we'll be eating Applebees again at least not here in Hawai'i. Plus food wasn't anything special.

The appetizers are half off their normal price, which ranged around $6 to $7  dollars.  I loved my Margaritas but their version of the long island ice tea was the favorite at my table.  We orders  2 orders each of the three Appetizers, the boneless wings, steak quesadillas and a spinach and artichoke dip.

75,Gabrielle C.,"Pearl City, HI",198,103,642.0,5.0,2017-04-25,"Tried out Applebee's for the first time here in Hawaii! After seeing the horrible reviews at the other location in Ewa Beach near foodland, we were skeptical to come but heard the one here at Ka Makana Ali'i was better. Parking is definitely better as well as there is parking throughout ans around the mall.  Glad we did come here! We came right when they opened around 11am and there was no wait and was seated right away. We were also greeted upon entering which is a plus.  Our server was Sashanna.... and she was WONDERFUL! She gave us suggestions when we asked and gave in a lot of inputs of what she liked and didnt liked which helped us choose as we found to like the same things. From the start she told us about their combo deals where you get a choice of 2 entree plates and 2 side salads or 1 appetizer to share. The prices range for these combos from $25- $35 depending on the entrees you share. There are also half priced appetizers everyday as well from 3p-6p and 9pm-close. For our food we chose to eat the Chicken Wonton tacos and ordered the combo of Onion rings for the appetizers and 4 cheese max and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and the Spinach artichoke cavatappi. The appetizers were sooo good. Onion rings fresh ans crisped and the Chicken Wonton Tacos were delicious! Somethjng i have never tasted before and is a must try! It has sauced, glazed chopped chicken on the bottom with a coleslaw type veggies on the top. As for our pastas we weren't AS impressed. My 4 cheese mac and cheese seemed like they didnt have cheese in the pasta at all. The sauce from the chicken overrided the whole plate. I didnt finish it there but when i took it home had to pack on the cheese to finish it. My boyfriend's spinach artichoke pasta was pretty good tho. If you love spinach you'll be happy cause they threw a whole crap load of spinach on top of the pasta which we just pushed aside as it seemed just for the looks haha. The pasta alone tho did contained a well mix of spinach and artichoke. Wished there was more cheese or a thicker sauce to it for a fuller bite.  Last but not least for dessert we got the Triple Chocolate Melted Cake. For $9.00 it was okay... the chocolate fudge cake was delicious tho! But for $9.00 wished the portion was bigger. Would buy again tho for the taste of we really want the dessert. Thanks for the wonderful customer service SASHANNA!!! You're the reason why this location is getting 5 stars.

239,April Tricialen B.,"Wahiawa, HI",69,14,2.0,3.0,2017-04-26,"30 minute wait at 3:30PM was understandable especially on the weekend. I am giving my experience as a 3 star because the wait for my actual entree ended up becoming an hour and a half long after we had already ordered the appetizers and kids' food. When we ordered, the order went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later we found out one of our orders was not able to be made because they ran out of the baby back ribs. We ordered something different, and they ended up adding an additional and wrong entree. My brother's girlfriend got her food 30 or so minutes after the appetizer came out. After another 15 minutes is when the rest of the food came out. My entree was wrong, so I had to wait another 10 minutes before my food came out. My daughter had fallen asleep during the 30 minute initial time wait, and she was able to wake up from her nap to eat her food and finish it before I even got mine. I mean, the people who came in 30 minutes after us got their food and left before I finished my food. During the time of our visit, the fire alarm went off twice to evacuate the building, but no one moved to make an effort to let guests know whether or not the alarm is real. My dad had to ask another waiter (while Kawena was checking other tables and putting in orders) to see what's going on. Manager didn't make an announcement and told the waiter to let us know we should wait 3 minutes before exiting or finding out whether or not the alarm is real because ""Papa John's usually has a fire drill."" Wait, so does this mean if they didn't know if it was a drill or not, we'd wait 3 minutes to find out if there's smoke or fire in the actual building? Shouldn't the building be notified whether or not there will be a drill? The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because Kawena was a great waitress and always checking up on us. I asked her for a customer survey, but there are no paper surveys and was given the suggestion to do an online survey. Instead, the manager, Katie, came by to talk to me and had taken off $50 worth of food and drinks. Okay, that's good, but the chances of us coming back here would be a bit slim. Depending on whether or not we want to use whatever coupon or discount thing Katie gave us for future use.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=200,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.252,2.8

Upon entering usually the hostess would ask us if we would prefer a booth, table or seated at the bar area but we were never asked and she tried seating us at the bar with the table and chairs being a little high we asked to be seated at a table instead. Husband just had knee surgery and trying to seat on a high chair would be difficult for him. But guess she thought with him limping that the table she chose would be for us. Uh no.  Anyways, our waitress came took our orders and disappeared.  We seen her walking around but never came back to check on us instead other waitresses stopped by to check on us which for us would've been nice to have our waitress do that to get her tip but guess she didn't  need it.

We felt so sorry for them especially with their little girl who looked about 2 years old getting tired and probably hungry.

We was greeted once we opened the door. I thought it was gonna be busy but it wasn't even though it was lunch. Got seated right away. We got the big table near the entrance. When I was about to sit down, the seats had oil spots and looked dirty. The waitress who sat us down saw me using the napkin to clean and she didn't really say anything. My mom even noticed her looking at me to what I was doing but didn't at least offer to clean it or get me more napkins. But it's okay I guess. They obviously had better things to do.  We ordered the 2 ribs deal (I forgot how much it was, but it's the last page of the menu) and a salad with steak chimichurri. We also got the trio appetizer. While waiting for our food, our drinks arrived. The diet soda my mom got tasted hella flat and my boyfriend got a mango tea. Had no mango tea taste what so ever. It just tasted of a plain Lipton iced tea. We told our waitress that and common sense you either ask for a refill or replace it with something else. But noooooo, she just said ""oh I'm sorry. I'll let me them"". At first I thought maybe she'd get a new better one but no. Upon that, the food tasted okay. I ordered the salad but I pretty much ate the steak and had a few bites of salad.

310,Kasey H.,"Waianae, HI",16,1,,1.0,2017-05-06,Our experience with Apple Bees has really sucked!!! Our first experience was in Ewa Beach and they had the worst customer service ever. I told myself I would never eat there again. Then we ended up at the new Kapolei mall and was looking for somewhere to eat. As bad as I didn't want to eat there we figure we give them another shot and try again being that it was a different location. Once again it failed. From the time we walked in we had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated which I don't understand why because we were the only one there and there were a few tables open. The only reason why I gave this place 1 star was because our waiter Caelin was very accommodating and always checking up on us being that all we ordered was appetizers and waited over 45 minutes for it. Not a single manager was in sight to try and check up on us to see what was going.

The restaurant is very open and has many tables. The food came out at a reasonable time considering the restaurant just opened and my beer was cold too, so that's important! The best past of the experience was my server, Deviana. Deviana greeted me immediately, despite having numerous tables. She didn't rush my order, but also helped by suggesting different options and the specials. She was great! Servers like Deviana make Applebee's successful.

The restaurant wasn't too busy being that they close at 10 and we got seated at 9:15, but everybody around us didn't have food, I felt sorry for the family of 3 boys next to us that ended up taking their food to go because it was getting too long of a wait, we ended up getting our food before them and we had the same exact party of people, the food was ok but not worth the wait and price.

Oh wait, you don't have the soup, that's ok, we will take another salad. Oh now you do have the soup, great, we would prefer that since that was the original order. At least you offered to only charge for the soup and not the extra salad too. 15 mins later, thanks for bringing us the appetizer we ordered, and then 3 mins later bring out some of our entree's. Thank the employee who came out and said they would re-do the steak we ordered and not charge us for it since everyone else was done eating already and still no steak. Finally got the steak, and it came with mashed potatoes instead of the fries we ordered. At least you brought out a plate of cold fries to go with it. The only good thing about this meal were the green beans, they were delicious, and for that, you get the one star rating. It only took numerous attempts to get a take out box, then a bag, then the bill, which was wrong. 15 mins after that, we finally get the correct check, and that was after we had to remind you that you offered to remove the salad we didn't order and the steak that came out over an hour after we ordered our food. that was the longest meal ever and it was not fine dining.

Anyways, unfortunately my boyfriend found a long piece of black hair just basically swimming at the bottom of his cup & we only saw it while we were trying to stir the drink. The waitress got us a new one. THEN, the appetizers come out & there's white hairs on our chips.... So then we send it back. I'm assuming she's a manager because she was the only one wearing a blue shirt, but she came out give us our new spinach artichoke dip & said ""sorry about that"" & walked away. Kalena came back & asked us if she came to talk to us & my boyfriend said yes, but I wouldnt really say that was talking. She didn't address the issue at all, just said sorry & walked away. The food however was alright. Nothing special, everything on their menu looks like easy stuff you can basically make at home. I didn't really like much so I just got their bourbon chicken & shrimp with a side of rice. Their rice was hard, but the chicken was really juicy. Bottom line, we probably won't be coming back. But the one star is for you Kalena, you were so nice & we felt so bad that you got stuck with having to take our stuff back because of all the hairs, but you're great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=220,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.956,2.28

The food was alright.  WHY alright? The Server gave us someone else food first and we told them and we didn't order this.  We waited for appetizer for quite a time.  Lucky there's tv around us but we kept ourselves busy with our phones.  They had a specials for lunch.  My other half order ribs and I order chicken fingers.  Our main dishes took awhile to come out.  The ribs taste like it was cook and the meat didn't fall out of the bone.  So my boyfriend asked if we could talk to the manager on duty.  The manager took off the ribs and we decided just share my chicken fingers.   I glad she didn't charged us for the ribs because we were like this is American food place and they suck in making ribs.  I'm glad that the manager apologize and comp half our bill and offer deserts but we were in rushed.  Hopefully next time I tried this place I can give a better review and more stars.  I like the applebees in the mainland.  Services 2.5 Food 2.5 because the ribs didn't taste like ribs.

Had a House Salad and a Steak which came in a reasonable time.  The House Salad was ok, although I wasn't sure why cheese was sprinkled on it. Steak was cooked to the requested temp and was tender and juicy.  The Garlic Greenbeans with Bacon side rocked. The Baked Potato was done right.

We got a variety of appetizers: Chicken tacos Spinach and artichoke dip Buffalo boneless wings Chicken tortilla soup French onion soup Caesar salad  The only thing that skewed my overall opinion of this place was how uninformed the staff seems to be. For somewhere I'd consider to still be new, Management didn't seem to be around. Runners kept bringing the food to the wrong tables. Empty plates were never removed from our table. It was just overall ""in the weeds"" as those in the industry would describe. Hidden in the back of the drink menu you'll find appetizers are half off from 3-6pm daily as well as 9-close. The staff does not promote it nor tell you about it. When I asked, the waitress replied ""ya everything but the classic combo and ""build your own"". My family decided we didn't see anything we really wanted on the entree portion of the menu so we decided to choose a few appetizers here and there. In our selections we chose a few soups and small salads. Later in our bill we found out they weren't half off. Which isn't really a HUGE deal but when we questioned our server she said ""oh and the soups and salads aren't half off either"".

Our server was nice.  She checked up on our party to see if we needed anything... good experience. Things took a turn when our entrees came... 1. My niece ordered the kids' chicken grillers.  The server came back with a kids' grilled cheese.  Then her chicken took forever to come out.  Her broccoli came out before her chicken.  By the time her chicken came, everyone else was more than half way through their meals. 2. My dad, the birthday boy, ordered his steak medium.  When he got his food, his steak was well done.  It was tough and hard to cut.  When his new plate came out, the steak was cooked correctly, but the kitchen forgot to put the correct condiments on his baked potato.  3. My son ordered a blackberry lemonade quencher.  The server came back with the strawberry one.  At this point, I told him to just drink it because it might take forever for him to get another one.  4. When we got the check, we just got the receipt with no card holder, which I thought was weird because all the restaurants I've been to use those holders.  Management should really look into using those.  It's easier for both the customer and the server.  Credit cards and money can get lost, especially if the server is handling more than one check at a time.

The plus side is that the manager and the server always checked in with us to let us know when the food was coming.   I'm not sure if my dad would come back to eat here.

I was most nervous about how long our food would take only because many people on Yelp said that the wait time for the food was outrageously long.  Surprisingly, our appetizer came within about 5 minutes and our entrees came out some time after that; it was definitely not a wait longer than any other restaurant.  Overall, I found the food to be delicious.  I am a huge spinach artichoke fan and it was very good; it seemed a bit saltier than other places but it wasn't a problem.  My boyfriend seemed to like his chicken tenders and he had ordered tea and he liked the fact that they gave him extra hot water on the side.  My pasta was good; very cheesy and the chicken was tasty and seasoned.  I only wish that they gave a little bit more chicken; the chicken to pasta ratio seemed off.  Then we ordered a chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert which was delicious as well.   The food was overall great but there were a few minor things that struck me as odd overall.  First, our table was bare; it had the menus on it, but usually in restaurants, they usually have a small rack with condiments, salt and pepper, etc.  At this restaurant, there wasn't any of that so we had to ask for any condiments we wanted.  Also, when the waitress gave me my water, there was no ice in it (it was semi cold) and she said it was because they had run out of ice, which has never happened to me in a restaurant before. Honestly, those little odd things that I had noticed did not bother me much; I'm not super picky and it did not affect my overall visit.  There was no wait time, the food was good and came out quickly, and everyone was very nice.  I would try to go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=60,2.2,2.47,2.47,2.9920000000000004,2.3620000000000005

Our server was awesome, he recommended a the Lemon Squeeze Strawberry cocktail and the watermelon sangria which was both really good. The watermelon Sangria was the best one though, it kinda reminds you of a jolly rancher. He checked up on us and refilled our chips for the dip and made sure we were okay. Again great service, food and drinks were delicious and both me and our coworker got really full off that sharing one appetizer (we were really hungry, too!).

The customer will feel confident that they're getting what they ordered and is the least you can do as a waitress.  My other ding was the bathroom, the manager should have the bathroom looked at to wipe, flush, clean, refill, etc not only during closing.  It was disgusting and a mess.  Other than that this place is nice & new.  A lot of parking in the shopping center.  I would try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=300,2.44,2.47,2.47,2.8640000000000003,2.458

And Kekoa's (Christian's) attempt at providing good memorable service slightly saved the experience. That was it. Lastly, the receipt was handed to us without a proper holder so it appeared sloppy.

This is a pretty new restaurant in an upscale area, so a friend and I were excited to try! We went on a Friday around lunch time and were seated immediately, however, we were seated all the way in the back near the bathrooms. Not sure if this is normal or whatever, but it was a little far away, and we had no views or TV. Service overall was okay, nothing special, nothing awful. There wasn't any proper introduction from any of the staff; it was pretty much just sit, order, eat, and leave. I never got any names of any of the three (yes, three) different waitresses that served us. Like I said though, the service wasn't awful, it just wasn't special.  As for the food, we did the combo meal where we could get an appetizer and two entrees for around $30. Really good value, food was just okay. I got the Fiesta Chicken, which consisted of an overcooked chicken breast, Mexican sauce, and cheese on a bed of tortilla chips. It also came with a side of Spanish rice, kinda tasted like dirt. Bland. While the chicken was a bit overdone, it was overall pretty good. The other entree was a Chicken Artichoke Pasta, which, when finished, ended up like a spinach pasta dish with two pieces of chicken. It was good though, just had a bit too much spinach.  3 stars for okay service, okay food, and an overall experience nothing short of, well, mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=140,2.36,2.49,2.49,2.54,2.438

Immediately greeted at the door by the host, something that really makes a great impression. I'm quite amused with the harsh reviews here. Again, I believe unrealistic expectations and just nasty attitudes unfortunately dwindle the ratings of a place like this. This isn't a hole in the wall nor is it a fancy pants fine dining place either. Quit being cheap and quit expecting to be treated like royalty. Anyhow, continuing with my review! Place is very spacious with a lot of wiggle room. The decor is very industrial and modern. Along with the ambiance, this place was also very clean! TVs galore, perfect place for sports watching with beer drinking and app eating. This place will be a mad house when the NFL is back! Prices I believe were VERY reasonably priced with the various mix and match options. Take a look at the photos of the menu I posted to see what I mean. You either have to have no understanding of food costs or just pretty hungry to think the portions don't match prices. They also half priced apps and beer specials TWICE A DAY! The value is quite unprecedented so for people to call this place a rip off are really outta touch with reality. (Sorry not sorry) The food came out really hot and fresh. I'm quite timid with the quality of food with chain restaurants yet I was not disappointed one bit. The 2 of $12 apps we chose were the Chicken Tacos and Spinach Artichoke Dip. Both apps came out very fast, served hot, crunchy and packed with flavor! We also ordered a burger stuff with pickles, bacon and onions. Opted to go with onion rings vs fries. Burger had a good char to it, the bun used had a very good firm texture to it, crucial to making a burger that much better.  Our server RHEA hit on all the right points when serving my table. Proper introduction, very welcoming, available for any questions and requests, table always bussed, drinks constantly topped off. VERY WELL DONE! Nothing but great things to say about this location.

We had a big group of 15 and didn't RSVP, so the wait was 55-60 minutes. I had ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken which was apart of the 2 for $35.00 deal. The deal is for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer. The bottom of the chicken was burnt. Potatoes tasted a bit dry and had a lot of GARLIC butter, but there weren't that many on my plate. But besides that everything else looked fine. Apart of the deal we got a Artichoke and Spinach dip with chips as our appetizer. Very good, cheesy with great flavors and seasoning. It also came with a side of salsa. The salsa was spicy and delicious. It left your month with a nice little burning, but not to over whelming.  Desert was fantastic. They say a picture say a thousand words, I say the picture speaks for it's self. Cake moist, warm, fluffy, and with a nice gooey inside. Most of the time, I see a picture no try to imagine how big it will be. Most of the time the actual this is smaller than expected. But in this case it was bigger than expected. And as good as it looks.   So when we came today, June 24th I decided to get the Four Cheese Mac with Honey Pepper Chicken Strips. Which was delicious. The noodle were cooked perfectly, the cheese sauce was creamy cheesy goodness(wish I had a bit more, just cause it was so good). There was a decent amount of bacon bits. But my favorite part was the Honey Pepper Chicken Strips. The sauce was spectacular, sweet with a nice pop of heat that left a little bit of heat in the back of your mouth. The chicken strips where crispy, they had a decent amount of flower, and they were cooked well. And I had the Caesar Salad as my appetizer. As show in the picture, which was taken before I took a single bite, there were only a few crotons,2-3 and a little bit of salad. Honestly at first glance I thought they had given me a partially eaten salad. In addition to the unappealing size, a hand full of the pieces of lettuce were brown. Another person in our group had ordered a garden salad today. The size was good, the lettuce was fresh, and they had a decent amount of various topping. When we had come the Sunday prior, a member in our party had the Caesar Salad as well. When they were served, the size was good, the lettuce fresh and a decent amount of crotons. I'm not sure if they are inconsistent or if that particular plate wasn't made well. In addition another member of our party ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken, the chicken was partially burnt.

It took 10mins for a server to greet us, another 20mins to get WATER. At this point, I'm already disappointed because serving water isn't that hard. That's the FIRST thing you serve at a restaurant, even if the guests don't want it. We were seated right next to the bar, where the gentlemen on that side had drinks refilled THREE times while we waited for our water. Our appetizers came out. Those were good. Another 30mins, we waited....for our entrees. Fyi, only 40% of the tables throughout the restaurant were filled and it was dinner time. Our entrees came out except one. Mind you, our food came out cold. Finally, my friend's food came out. I don't know why it took so long when him and I ordered the same thing! His food though, came out with the wrong sides lol. I don't know how else the experience could get any worse. My friend's entree came out with the correct sides and it was finally time to eat.

We told the hosts that we will be right outside to wait. Forty five minutes went by and we're still waitng to be called. Finally went in and asked how much longer the wait is, and found out there were several open tables, and no one bothered to call us. Did they forget to call us?   Once seated, we ordered our drinks and waited. And waited. Another 15 minutes went by, I told another server about our wait, and the drinks finally came in. We ordered our food, a half rack of ribs & chicken with a loaded baked potato, bbq brisket tacos, corn dog, mac and cheese, steak and shrimp combo, the butcher's reserve sirloin steak and some appetizers.   My food came with fries and garlicky green beans. They were alright, not salty and tastes well. But the rack of ribs was dry, salty and tough. The chicken was seasoned right but like the ribs, it was dry and tough. And the baked potate wasn't buttered, and came in with excessive sour cream on it. My family had their own comments about the food, and I'll leave it like that.   The bill came and it was someone else's bill. What a surprise! The manager corrected it, and I paid.

After standing outside of restaurant for 40 mins along with many other people patiently waiting two servers came out with the paper wait list and told everyone to leave because the kitchen was backed up and we would have to wait even longer to be seated at a table and that once the orders would be placed that we should expect more than 1 hour wait for food orders to be delivered (which was strange considering how empty the restaurant was). When we questioned why the management or hostess did not notify any of the parties who already waited 30 mins to 1 hour for a table they said that they were servers who didn't know and were very sorry because management tells them nothing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=320,2.48,2.44,2.44,1.956,2.456

Our server did the best she could, but due to the lack of communication with the kitchen...most things my child ordered was not available until a later time. Not once, but twice she had to come back to our table to have him choose something different! Not acceptable, but since she seemed sincerely apologetic we ended up sticking with the ribs (which they apparently don't have until after 12pm and we were here since 11am). She came back the second time to say that baked potatoes aren't available until after 4pm!! Seriously!!! Again...unacceptable!! On top of that, the food turnaround is quite slow. Like I said, we were here at 11am and my other son didn't receive his chicken tenders and fries until after 12pm. The portion was so small, that there's no reason for it to take that long to come out!! In fact, its two fried items...it shouldn't take that long to come out period!! I ordered a firecracker shrimp pasta that was so unappetizing that I had a stomach ache. What made me more upset was the fact that there was no management to assist with the situation. That's poor customer service! I work in the customer service industry and I have no idea who does their training because this is by far the worst experience I have had. The Wendy's at the same mall has impeccable service and this corporation should take some note from that fast food joint!

We actually wanted to go to db grill but we called and they said the wait was 1 hour. Since we were already at the mall we decided to give Apple bees a try. Went to check in and they said the wait was 20-30 minutes. They took my friends number and said they would send him a text when the table was ready. It was pretty cool because they sent a text and it took you to their site that had like a countdown timer for your table which started at 30 minutes. The timer had counted down and now it said that it was 0 minute wait, but we still got no text saying the table was ready. My friend jokingly sent a text back saying ""hello?"" And we were finally seated after about a 40 minute wait.  Okay so service... our waitress seemed very nice but I think maybe inexperienced. She brought us drinks and we asked for a few minutes to review the menu. We were looking at those shared meals where it says one appetizer and 2 full entrees. We were kinda joking/ wondering why we had to pay an extra $1 to make the chicken tenders meal a ""platter"" so we asked he waitress and she said by making it a platter it came with coleslaw and more chicken and more fries. Thought that was weird because that means that you were actually getting a small portion meal but had to pay an extra $1 to make it full size when it already says full entree. Anyways that's not her fault because she doesn't make the prices. Btw we ended up paying the extra dollar. I ordered the all day brunch burger which sounded good and said it came with fries. When my burger came out the fries portion was seriously sad! Like if you're gonna give so little fries you should maybe put it on a smaller plate.  I'll attach a picture of it. The rest of the food was good. Boneless wings with sauce on the side, 3 cheese Mac and cheese, and the chicken platter.  Paying... I see a lot of reviews about taking a while to pay and I honestly can't say if it was or wasn't long because I think we were complaining about my small portion of fries. When we got our bill we had the 2 for $25 but was charged $27.50. I asked the waitress why and she started to tell me that oh because the platter was an extra $1... ummmm ok $26.... lol she went to talk to the manager and there was a glitch in the system. I actually didn't notice the charge till after I already ran my card so they asked for my card back and refunded me the $1.50. Yes I actually took the $1.50 refund.  In the end me and my friends said we shoulda just waited the hour for db grill.

I don't care but she then proceeds to look for the nozzle instead of offer me a napkin. Finally I ask what it was (I assumed it was water since she was not very concerned) and turns out its lemonade. Cool. Sticky. No napkin, still, as she wipes the bar down. We order, 20 min later food comes, then I taste all my food, everything is cold but the meat. I ask if I put my side on another plate if they would heat it up. Any other restaurant I've been too would have said don't worry about it I'll get fresh. Nope, not her. She microwaved it for me. yum. Now too hot to eat microwaved side. Thanks.  Whatever, food was good. If it were me and I sprayed the customer down with lemonade then microwaved their food I would have given a discount.

132,Nikki C.,"Pearl City, HI",59,31,49.0,3.0,2017-07-14,"Went here on a Saturday night, was expecting to wait a while being the mall was quite packed and all restaurant were full. We checked in, then got seated about 15 minutes later.  They sat us near the bar area, it was clean for a busy night. You go to some restaurants and sit next to the bar and its a shit show.  Our server was Caelan, greeted us right away and took our drink order. Then came back a few mins later and took our dinner order.  I actually had to use the restroom, so I might as well mention that it was clean. I do however want to mention, while walking to the restroom you pass the entrance/exit of kitchen so I almost got clipped by a tray. Im thinking the walkway is kinda narrow with some blind spots- but whatever maybe the waiters will learn to take the corners more cautiously.  Food came maybe 10-15 mins later; we ordered the sampler appetizers. I must say that I enjoyed the artichoke dip much more then I do CPK's. The rest was good too, but the dip was best- might just get that as a full order next time.  Dinner- I had the 8oz top sirloin with garlic green beans & a loaded baked potato. Listen when I order steak from these places I dont expect it to be anything like Ruth's Chris, Mortons, or any of those other steak houses- so I cant complain, it was a bit over cooked for my taste, but like I said I've never had any Chilis, Outback or Red Lobster type of restaurant really impress me with the steak (so I have no idea why I always order, thats why I cant complain).  The green beans were, mehh. The loaded baked was mostly sour cream, like so much sour cream and hardy any cheese, bacon, and chives. So All in all. it was okay- not the best but then again not the worse.  My hubs had the ribs. He liked the mashed potatoes, also his green beans. However his ribs were stuck to the rib, lol. It didnt fall off the bone, which made it difficult to eat, he gave up half way through and was over it. So yeah, Idk maybe it was a bad batch of ribs being it was tough, but I do know he wont order that again.  Dessert- We shared the triple chocolate melt down. It was awesome. They also dont skimp on the ice cream, so thats a plus. I hate ordering dessert and getting the sorriest scoop of ice cream. LOl. It was chocolate heaven.  Service- Caelan was great. Very friendly, attentive and even made conversation with us. You can see that he enjoys his job.  So In regards to my Star ratings, I still fell like its a new restaurant and in time they will find their way. The food was mediocre, the dessert was great, and the service was exceptional. As long as they keep up with serving their customers well, in time they will be a well rounded restaurant deserving 4 or 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=140,1.96,2.4,2.4,2.1239999999999997,2.224

The only complaint was that it took 30 minutes for us to get our food.  It was my first time at Applebee's, and I liked it better than the other restaurant chains. We started off with the double crunch bone in wings with honey bbq sauce. I would agree with the name, double crunch. Even though it was drenched in sauce, it was still super crunchy. The sauce was yummy. I ordered the half rack honey bbq ribs. I really liked it. It was fall off the bone tender. I got the garlicky green beans with bacon and garlic mashed potatoes as my sides. I'm not a fan of green beans but this one was delicious. It was cooked just right. I don't like it mushy and I don't like it crisp, it has to be right in the middle.

We ordered a lunch special - two entrees for $25.  It comes with an appetizer.  Entrees:  chicken and pasta (the pasta was fun and swirly) and chicken caprese.  Both were standard, nothing to write home about.  I would have liked a little extra salt or pepper but there were no condiments out on the tables.   Our onion rings were great.  They were crunchy and easy to eat.  The side of barbecue sauce was good but I wanted ketchup.  Again, no condiments on the table.   Here's an odd thing...the prices of beverages was not listed in the menu - at least I couldn't find it.  A lemonade was $2.70 (asked the server) so we just had water with slices of lemon.

But right after we sat at the bar to wait for our table, they seated people in some of the empty seats!!! Once seated at a table, we were never served any water, food took long to come out, food was mediocre, I was charged almost $10 for a shot of grey goose.......disappointed once again!!!    The only reason for the 2 stars is because the manager was nice enough to accept a gift certificate from the other applebees that was already expired!

The bartender had zero help. So I can't blame her. We stood on a sticky floor just to get a seat at the bar.

Almost 40 minutes later our main entrees made it to the table.  I had the cedar lemon chicken and my kāne had the spinach + artichoke chicken cavatappi.  Good food but, not great and given the portion of chicken to mac & cheese we paid for overly priced kids meals. Not to mention 20 minute intervals for drink refills.  Our server thought someone refilled our drinks and after we finished our food came to the realization no one did.  Then over 15 minutes to get a box and bill, I honestly thought they really don't want customers to return. Wouldn't you!?! To be fair, it is one of the newer restaurants and a majority of the staff appeared to be first time servers.  Not saying we'll never go back, but, it's definitely not our first, second, third, fourth, or fifth choice (if you know what I'm saying) when deciding on where to go for dinner. AUGUST 2017 UPDATE We actually wanted to go and eat at Moena for dinner but apparently between 3:00-5:00p (don't quote me I may be off by an hour) only pupus are served and we were HUNGRY.  So, after walking to CPK and being quoted about an hour wait and wanting to just enjoy a nice sit down dinner we reluctantly went back to Applebee's which ended up being a great choice! At Applebee's all of the appetizers are 1/2 off from 3:00-6:00p we ordered EVERYTHING, again, we were hungry.  This time the service was awesome and I will attribute it to the server she was friendly, attentive, and we were served in a timely manner.  My kane enjoyed his brunch burger and the BBQ brisket tacos I had were sooooo ono!!

The meal itself wasn't bad for the price, however i was a little disappointed in the caprese mozzarella burger.  On the menu it sounded so good, ""Sautéed garlic and onions seared into an all-beef patty and topped with balsamic aioli, grilled tomatoes, grilled red onions, fresh mozzarella, and fresh basil.""  Sadly that was not what i got, there were a shit load of red onions on there, and they were not seared, or if they were it had to be seared for like 5 seconds, because they were RAW!  I tasted no balsamic aioli, and the ""fresh basil"" was a sad little single tiny basil leaf....like what the hell...I ended up taking off ALL the onions and basically just ate the rest of the burger which i dipped into ranch dressing.  I was really disappointed, to say the least...

I've never ate here before my Applebee's experience is only watching their commercials on tv. I was excited to actually try their food! I was set on getting pasta. We got the 2 for $30 which is great cause 2 pastas were $16 each. When you get the 2 for $30 you get one appetizer and two entrees. So in the end you make out a free appetizer!  The food took forever to come out. I'm not sure if our waitress really cared but she never fill our water and our food was cold by the time we received it.

14,Jan K.,"Waianae, HI",104,350,2581.0,3.0,2017-08-21,"AB - Updated. (2.5 stars). ""Dear Mrs. Applebee, I've gotta get somethin' off my chest!!"" - David Garrick (Dear Mrs. Applebee) After some coaxing to give AB another try, I did. I decided to update my review because I did have a much better experience the second time around!! But I do have to get something off my chest Mrs. Applebee!! The food here is very underwhelming and even with the HH prices, it doesn't excuse the quality... Not to me anyways. I went in to have an adult beverage and told myself that was all I was going to have... Umm, I ended up having 5... Hmm, Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol?!! :) That led me to the decision of ordering off the bar HH menu since it is cheap enough... I ordered the following: -Double Crunch Wings -Steak Quesadillas Double Crunch Wings - $6.25 (HH). (2.5 stars). Kristina, the bartender, was wicked awesome and allowed me to order my wings naked and get all the sauces on the side! I had a choice of Honey BBQ (which was decent), Hot Buffalo Sauce (very vinegary), Spicy Sweet Asian Chile Sauce (sweet but decent), and Thai Peanut Sauce (a little watery and not a very noticeable peanut flavor). This dish is cheap, I get it, but my wings tasted like they were fried over and over AND OVER again. Meaning... it was fried once. Then probably fried again. Then fried yet again?? The coating was literally disintegrating in my mouth as I bit into each wing. Ugh. I suppose since I had a few drinks that I ate about half of them just out of sheer hunger but I can't say it was great. I will definitely ask for naked wings and the sauces on the side if I order these wings again... which I'm sure I will when the BF is around! Steak Quesadillas - $5.75. (2.5 stars). Extremely cheap for the portion size. The tortilla was nice and crispy! To be fair, the menu does say that the quesadilla has pico de gallo in it but I just felt there were too many raw onions for me. Just personal preference. The steak was cut up into bite size cubes and was tender so that was a pleasant surprise. The salsa verde had a decent flavor with garlic and cilantro being the highlights. I didn't taste any heat which was a little disappointing. The salsa was awful! It tasted like tomato and onion water. That's it!! There was no flavor whatsoever and it was extremely watery. I asked for sour cream on the side and that was my favorite part!! I love sour cream. This quesadilla doesn't have very much filling but the cheese was melted nicely. I would order this again but ask for the pico on the side. --- All in all, the food was a little better the second time around!! Kristina definitely made my visit worth it. She treats each customer how she would want to be treated which is rare in this day and age!! I'm glad to see the GOLDEN RULE still exists!! Kristina is the main reason why I will be back to AB in the future.

But, I figure I give it a try when I did my first visit to Ka Makana mall. We arrived a few minutes before they opened and when they did, they were prepared for the people. I was happy with where they sat us which I'm sure they put us there with our stroller in mind.  Our server Sasha (Sashana on the receipt) was very attentive. She was so friendly and courteous! Sasha quickly took our drink order (water) and brought it to our table right away. She asked if we were ready to order but, I told her it was our first time so we needed a bit to review the menu (and feed our baby) and I would let her know when we were ready.  The menu was easy to navigate and I couldnt help but notice the prices. Very reasonable! We ordered the classic appetizer which came with a lot of food! All very good and it came HOT!  Thank goodness we didn't order our actual lunch until after the appetizer was brought to us because I seen it and was like... um yeah. I'll just have some fries. Lol. Sasha was amazing to explain the whisky burger my husband got and when he asked for onion rings she made sure he was ok with the up charge and that it was 5 pieces. She also asked if I wanted my fries now instead of waiting. Thankfully she asked... if she did bring it later with my husband's food, I wouldn't have eaten it as I would be full from the huge appetizer! Sasha was on point with refilling our drinks and she took very good care of us. It made the experience a great one and I would hope my experience would be the same when we return.  Even if you feel like their food is mediocre or great, the service really does make a difference. And that's what made this review a 5 star instead of a 2 or 3 like other people.

And they said everything was perfect. But when we went last night. We instantly had terrible service. She wasn't friendly. Didn't even seem like she wanted to help us. Didn't seem like she enjoyed her job. Or even wanted it for that matter. As if she couldn't care less if she did a good job or not. She also seemed very impatient. And when we had asked questions. She didn't seem to know the answer or want to find out the answer. Our servers name was Sylvia I believe. And the only person that seemed of the most help. Was the hostess. Our food was sitting there for how long. We sat perfectly in front of the window to see our food sitting there forever. And on top of that, we didn't receive all of our food. And they still charged us for it. Of course we said something and they took it off. But there were how many severs and people in the kitchen who clearly saw it still sitting there. And yet nobody even bothered to acknowledge the fact that it was someone's food sitting there. And hasn't received it. I would give this zero stars if I could. Even my parents said we aren't going back there ever again. The entrees were cold when we received it. Took over 30 minutes just to receive our appetizers. Also cold. We waited so long to eat. We at all the appetizers than our actual food. And honestly the appetizers tasted better than the main course. To make it even worse than the already terrible service we received. Before we were even seated. We had been told that the wait was 45mins-1hr. And we clearly saw how many OPEN tables there were. But none of the workers cleared it. There was multiple tables still sitting there with dirty dishes and food everywhere. Even as we left the restaurant the same tables we saw to begin with. Still has food on it. They don't care much for maintaining their restaurant. Nor do they care how long the dirty dishes sit there. We clearly saw 5 tables that's could've easily been cleaned so that more people could be seated faster. And towards the end of our dinner they had already started cleaning the bathroom and there were still a couple tables left. And they had closed the bathroom. So no one could use it.

My first time dining in at the Applebee's and to be quite honest, it may be my last. First impressions really can make or break any situation. From the moment we stepped through the doors, my friends and I were greeted with the most sassy, insincere hello by an employee going by the name Jaz. Her tone was VERY unfriendly, her face registered like she didn't care about doing her job to the best of her abilities, and the vibe she gave off was so unpleasant that it made my friend and I exchange the same taken aback look. When she seated us, she quickly motioned to where the drink menu was located, said her insincere parting words, and went on her way. Coming from a girl that works in customer service, I totally understand that some days are worse than others because some people suck and ruin your mood. Maybe she was having a bad day, who knows. However, if your job is to be that first point of contact between the business and the customers, you should be able to at least ACT like you want to be there and ACT like you like your customers. If you can't, then maybe you should ask to switch to a position where you don't have to interact with people.  We would've walked out if it wasn't for the very friendly server who helped us not soon after being seated. Aaron G was a breath of fresh air after that uncomfortable encounter. He was kind and friendly and had a good vibe about him. Our food came out in a timely manner and he checked up on us to make sure we were doing ok. I really have nothing bad to say about my experience with him or anything following the initial first few minutes in the restaurant. It's unfortunate because I was excited to finally try this place out. Every other time I wanted to there was always a long wait. But now after this experience I'm sad to say I may not ever go back.

They also offer free Wi-Fi in addition to Ka Makana Ali'i's free Wi-Fi. Service is hit or miss here, just like their other location.

Nothing to say about the beer for obvious reasons.  We wanted to try a dessert as well hoping to end on a good note but even that fell short.

For some reason, I was craving for a burger so I ordered the American Standard.  I also added the House Salad.  It seemed liked a lot, covered with croutons, cheese, tomatoes and cucumbers. As for my burger, it was thick and huge!  I ordered my beef as medium-rare, which was recommended.  It was juicy and tender. However, it was salty and greasy.  I could taste the butter from the bun and it was overpowering. I tried to eat it all, but could only do half. I also got their Raspberry Iced Tea to drink.  It was refreshing and has the perfect amount of sweetness. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Combo. It was perfect because it's a sampler of the appetizers all in one plate. He enjoyed his dish.  I got to try some of the items from his plate: spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella stick and boneless wings.  They were all so delicious.

I stood awkwardly at the bar and waited to be acknowledged. When I was finally addressed the bartender made me feel like I was annoying her and she was walking away as I was talking. When I asked about the lack of condiments she stated that the burger came undressed (just meat and bread) and I told her that according to the app, it's supposed to come with everything. When they brought out my fresh fries another employee stuck her hand in my bag and pulled out the old ones. Unprofessional and unsanitary. The quality of service is poor at this location.

First things first, upon entering, there were three hosts at the front who looked at us and continued their conversation without saying hello, or ""We'll be right with you"" or something. We stood there awkwardly for several minutes until we were acknowledged and brought to our table. )': After being sat, our server came to us promptly. I could tell she meant well because she advised us that happy hour was ending, but I felt sort of rushed to put in an order. After putting in our appetizer order, she came back and asked if we were ready to put out entree order in. I told her that I needed a few minutes, but I don't think she heard me because she started taking our order anyways :') So oh well lol. The food was all right. The mozzarella sticks we ordered tasted very generic. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip, which was pretty all right. I ordered a steak with garlic mashed potatoes, and the steak came out very chewy and the mashed potatoes were kinda liquidy haha. It was okay. My brother's and sister-in-law's orders were all right too. Overall, our visit was okay! We may attempt to come here in the future. Three stars because I'm not that hard to please really, and I could tell that the waitress was trying hard! That day we went, they ran out of ice so they couldn't serve any drinks lol. Oh, and on a side note, the only reason why we went to Applebee's that afternoon was to redeem a coupon we received in the mail for a free appetizer. However, we were told that it could only be redeemed at the one in Ewa Beach? Odd, but oh well. If you go here with a coupon, be sure to ask if it can be used at that location. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=80,2.8,2.7,2.584,2.284,2.74

Then we finally got a ""be right there"" over the shoulder shout.  15 minutes in our drinks arrived.  Food came out after 40 minutes, but one of our orders was incorrect.  We didn't want to have to wait another half an hour for a correction so just took it as is.  Lastly, and this is by far the worst, our server asked if we needed change on a $38 tab when we had given him $50.  Even excellent service doesn't call for a 30% tip.  The server then returned with a $10 bill instead of change as requested, when I told him that's not what I wanted he pocketed the $10 and said ""Oh this is mine? Thanks"".  I literally was in shock. I had to stop him and correct him yet again.   All in all great deals, concept, decor, food...please work on staff training and kitchen ticket times; we'd hate to not return when there's so much potential.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=160,2.76,2.69,2.576,2.2199999999999998,2.718

We finally sit at a table and someone in our group of six asks the waiter what was on tap? I guess he didn't hear, his response was, ""What?!"" Never have I been to a restaurant and get that kind of response! Then, we order our appetizers & meals. The wait for appetizers was long, so we asked our waiter if we were getting it before our dinner, he goes to check & comes back with our appetizers five minutes later & they were cold...spinach/artichoke dip & onion rings. Also, had to ask for utensils. Waited quite some time for our dinner, even my 6 year old was asking why it was taking so long for Kraft mac n cheese. We finally get our food and they were all cold...chicken tenders, fried shrimp, fries, mac n cheese & mozzarella sticks...ALL cold! Only the chicken/shrimp sizzling platter was hot. Complained to the manager & she says she'll see what she can do to our bills(we had 2 separate bills)...we get our bills from our waiter & nothing was done to our bills. So, we asked to see the manager and she says she was busy & didnt have a chance to look at it.

17,Nicole E.,"Kapolei, HI",16,53,4.0,2.0,2017-11-25,"Decided to stop by here on a Tuesday evening. We were a little weary after reading all the reviews, but gave them the benefit of the doubt.  As soon as we walked in there was no hostess, or no greetings from any of the staff. A waitress saw us, and ran in the back where I assume she called for the hostess. The hostess came out, in no rush and walked over to us (I think her name was Sylvia). She had no smile or any kind of friendly demeanor. She sat us quickly and walked away. It was already off to a poor start, but fortunately our waitress was great. She was super sweet and bubbly and made up for the rude hostess.  However, our food was a different story. We ordered the spinach dip, and when it came out the chips were hard and the cheese on the top of the dip was solid. It was as if it had been sitting around a while after it was melted. I ordered the honey bbq ribs, and it was the toughest ribs I've ever eaten in my life! No joke! Even the huge steak knife they gave to me couldn't cut it. The flavor was decent, but I had a difficult time finishing it as it took me 5 minutes to just cut one rib off. My baked potato was the not even close to being baked. They cut it in half, and it was still completely solid! I tried to mash it a little with my fork but it did not budge at all.  I don't think I will be returning back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei,2.52,2.74,2.536,2.3760000000000003,2.652

Our waitress was initially attentive but that didn't last long. After ordering, our appetizer came fairly quickly. Too bad the chips for our spinach artichoke dip were stale on top and soaked with oil on the bottom. Our entrees after that took nearly an hour to come after that, which is crazy because the establishment was nearly empty and there were several wait staff. On top of that, 2/3 of our entrees were sitting out so long that the cheese hardened and the rest was room temperature. By that point our waitress was just MIA and the person we had to flag down to reheat our food was a manager. My husband ended up having to flag down the waitress to get the bill and boxes. He then had to get up from the table and physically hand her the check because she was too busy standing around watching the cooks push food out.

I went for lunch and got seated right away. Staff was friendly and service was quick. There's a great lunch menu available with plenty of choices. I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp sizzling plate, and the fried breaded shrimp with fries.  The Bourbon chicken came out sizzling hot and full of flavor. The breaded shrimp was crunchy and addictive. It comes with your choice of cocktail sauce or tartar sauce. There's a nice side of coleslaw too.

An old rule of thumb is if the front of the house is dirty the back of the house (kitchen) is much more dirty. The place is NOT busy with quite a few employees in the back. I don't see why they don't have somebody out front cleaning. Probably a management thing. I reviewed the menu it appears to be a lot like a Chili's or an Outback.

Checking back in 30 min later, they had to clean a booth to seat us.  (Remember, restaurant is half full.). We sat, and the table was greasy.  Hostess said she'd bring our utensils. 3.  Ordered our salads and waited 40 minutes to be delivered.  Server had apologized for the wait and that their manager would deliver our meals.  They were delivered without comment or utensils and we had to ask for them.  I specifically asked for chopsticks, the manager said okay, and came back with fork and knife.   4.  My Thai Shrimp Salad (tagged as healthy, lighter fare) consisted of about 3 ounces of cole slaw mix with 3 sprigs of cilantro DROWNING in peanut dressing with sliced almonds and maybe 6 small shrimp.  It was hard to eat.  It's a good thing I filled up on lemonade.

I called them right when I got home to let them know they should double check their take out orders next time so this won't happen to someone else and just got an apology. Then, their chicken tenders and even chicken wings taste like it's been fried so many times. I paid about $40 for this.

Tonight Patricia was our waitress. She was very personal and helpful throughout always checking on us throughout. We started out with our free chips and salsa from our Yelp app and Wonton tacos. We also both ordered iced teas. Our drinks came first then our chips and salsa, and tacos. My husband ordered the Steak salad and I ordered the Salmon with broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. They delivered it with French fries and corrected it immediately. The salmon was absolutely delicious! It was underneath lightly buttered spinach, broccoli, a touch of a sweet mustard sauce on the side and my garlic mashed potatoes. I would highly recommend it. My husband is a hearty eater and fully enjoyed his steak salad. In closing, I did have the brownie bite dessert. Perfect for some chocolate satisfaction. Can be shared or by itself.

5,Mel M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,133,57.0,3.0,2017-12-23,"My mother-in-law, who passed away a year ago, absolutely loved shrimp. At the risk of sounding like Forrest Gump's friend, (Benjamin Buford Blue...but everyone calls him Bubba) she loved breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp, shrimp scampi, shrimp cocktail, Creole shrimp, garlic butter shrimp, popcorn shrimp, shrimp tacos, gumbo with shrimp, coconut shrimp, shrimp and grits, shrimp etouffee... So when my wife and I were deciding on where to dine for lunch on a Friday before Christmas, we considered our options on the west side and decided to head out to Applebee's...despite past reviews indicating extremely slow service. We got there around 12:30 and were told it would be about a 30-minute wait! I probably wouldn't have said anything about the wait if it wasn't for the obvious empty tables. I briefly considered heading out somewhere but since my wife and I were stopping by the Nagoya Bakery for some coconut bread (makes awesome French toast!) and to check out last minute shopping deals, we decided to stick with Applebee's. After about 30 minutes, my wife received a call and we were shown our table, a semi-booth with openings on both ends of the table close to the kitchen. It took a few minutes before we were served cold water and it was, who we believed to be, the shift leader who took our order. We ordered the $25 combo meal with the Spinach dip as our appetizer (pretty good) and the Double Crunch Shrimp for my wife and I had the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp. Someone emerged from the kitchen and served us our appetizer...but instead of going around the tables to serve us the appetizer, he just lazily placed it where it was closest to him and away from us, expecting us to reach over, and didn't say a thing. My wife and I were conversing and could've missed the appetizer had we not seen him. Our server served us the entrees and thankfully made the effort to serve them on our side of the table. The place was a little loud...and the big party with a woman screaming like a banshee at times didn't help. Our meal was actually quite decent and the portions were bountiful...service, however still needs some work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei,3.2,2.8,2.596,,2.9600000000000004

We were told that some of the sections were closed because of the sunlight making it too hot?!?!?! Our food took over an hour and to try and make up for it they brought out chips and salsa. They screwed up on our order when it finally came and the food wasn't even hot so it obviously was sitting. I think they should have staffed properly for a football Sunday.

9,Chauncy W.,"Honolulu, HI",214,12,8.0,1.0,2017-12-27,"Unreal! Arrived around 7pm for dinner. We ordered our appetizers and entrees after being greeted by our server Cheyanne. Waited about 10 mins for our water to arrive which confuses me cuz I've been to many places and water is always the first thing that's on the table. 10 mins later... A man, who looked like the manager, asked if we've been served and we told him ""yes we have sir"". Cheyanne our server comes back apologizing for the delay and that the food would be out shortly. While we waited, we noticed that there were a bunch of food on the counter that looked ready to eat. The manager was there talking to the cooks. Couldn't he just simply put the MAN in MANager and help delivering those meals? While he was there ""managing"" we had to wait another 15 mins for our food to arrive. Here's where it became unacceptable for me as a customer to experience. First: Cheyanne and another server brought out our appetizers and entrees which baffled me cuz appetizers are supposed to come before the entrees. Second: Cheyanne accidentally spilled some salsa right by my feet as she brought me my steak quesadilla. I felt sorry for her at first because clearly she's under a lot of pressure. She apologized and said that she'll get another salsa cup for us. No problemo. (At first) Third: Our appetizers were cold. If they brought it out when they first finished it then it'll be nice and hot for us to enjoy. Fourth: That spilt salsa that I mentioned before, it was still there on the floor even after I finished my meal. How could this happen? I had to lean my foot out in front of it just so everyone else, especially children couldn't slip on it. A lot of the employees walked by it, even Cheyanne, yet no one didn't tend to this safety hazard. Lastly, as we complained about our experience to the staff, we found out that we weren't the only ones going through it this evening. Apparently two other tables right next to us were displeased with the service. It gotten so bad that one of em even told Cheyanne to return the food to the kitchen because of how long he had to wait. I've never been to an Applebee's before. This was my first time in one because I'm a born and raised country boy and I barely go into a restaurant like this. Yet being here just didn't live up to the standards of what I thought Applebee's could've been like from what I've seen in their commercials. The staff needs to work on their service skills and they need to be more on it. I didn't intend to write a one star review to complain but I hope that the company reads this post and hopefully learns from me and many other had experienced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei,3.04,2.75,2.592,,2.8660000000000005
43,Asami K.,"Honolulu, HI",91,2,2.0,1.0,2017-12-28,"This was my first time at an Applebee's but it was a very irritating and frustrating experience. We had a party of 5 but 3 of us are servers at other restaurants so we are generally really lenient with mistakes and we usually tip well; but our experience at Applebee's was simply unacceptable.  When we got seated, we didn't get utensils. For drinks, I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and it was a very watered down margarita in a tall glass. Never seen a margarita in a tall glass. We also ordered a watermelon sangria but it had blackberries in them. Another person ordered a blackberry sangria but guess what? The blackberry sangria had no blackberries! The bartender needs to get it together. Geez.  When we got to our appetizers, the chips we got for the artichoke dip were basically crumbs probably from the bottom of the bag. I suppose the other apps we got were okay though. No issues with those. But once we got to our entrees, they forgot to put sauce on one of the burgers, they forgot my boyfriend's order of onion rings, my half rack of ribs were really burnt, pretty sure they didn't put any salt or pepper into my mashed potatoes, and we also got the bottom end of a whole lettuce in our salad.  We wanted to get desserts, but we just thought we'd go elsewhere because we knew they were gonna screw it up again.  So we asked for the check and of course, they charged us for the onion rings and cheese that we didn't get. So I asked for the manager and when I complained to her about all those things, she said ""so what do you want me to do? Give you more chips for your dip?"" And that just made me snap. I asked for her to comp something off of our check. There's no way I'm leaving this restaurant without something for this terrible food and service.  Might give them another chance in the far future when they get their shit together. But other than that, I'd be really careful of ordering any steak or chicken from them. You just might get food poisoning or something from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kapolei?start=20,3.04,2.72,2.576,,2.8480000000000003

No restaurant needs to be this bright unless it's goal is to turn over that table and get you out the door as fast as possible. It does not have an inviting feeling. The bar area looks promising but i don't wanna get a sun tan from the super high intensity light bulbs. Bad planning.  Host at the door, he had a horrible attitude because he had to clean a table that my elderly grandfather wanted to sit at. The manager had to ask him to clean it after he told us no 3 times. The manager laughed with us after noticing his very open temper tantrum. lol Server got my drink wrong. Not that big of a deal, but at least hustle and get the correct one on the fly (means to hurry up). Not put me back into rotation after the bartender finishes making the entire restaurants drink orders. I care more about cocktails then i do food. My order was a simple patron margarita as stated in menu, she brings me a pomegranate one. ‍ Service is ok. I don't judge a restaurant by any one server, it's not fair to the restaurant. I get that people are people and there is a high possible chance that she won't even be there in 3 months.  Reason for the TWO stars is because this place is not worth going back TWICE.

3,AJ D.,"Waipahu, HI",29,15,14.0,3.0,2018-01-07,"First and probably last visit.  Visited this place on a Friday night without a reservation for a party of 5. The wait was about 15-20 minutes.  We were asked if we were okay with sitting on the high-tops but we preferred the regular table. They were able to seat us on a table by the bar. Before looking through the menu, we had to move from our first table to a table further back because our 5th seat could not block the walkway. Understandable.  Our server started us off with our drinks and appetizers. We were told that they had to wash the cups so our drinks didn't come out right away. The place was not packed, so I don't know how they could run out of cups. We placed the rest of our order after the drinks came out.  Our appetizers were the spinach artichoke dip and bone-out hot buffalo wings. The appetizers were okay. The serving size of these appetizers looked decent for 3 people. By the time we were done with our appetizers, we were more than halfway done with our drinks. It was another 5 - 10 minutes before the rest of our order came out. We had to ask another employee for water because our waitress came back to our table only when our main dishes were served.  When she came back she saw that our drinks needed refills so she went to get us refills. When she brought the refills, she didn't clear the empty glasses that were piling up on our table. These empty glasses weren't cleared from our table at all.  The food was okay. I ordered a steak salad. My steak was cold. I would think that if the steak were cooked at the time I ordered, then it would be hot.  If you want a loaded bake potato, then you have to pay extra for each thing you want on your potato. I believe it was $0.99 each.  When we were done with our entrees, we ordered desert and coffee, and asked for boxes. She brought our boxes but didn't give us a bag. We asked her for a bag 3 times and she still didn't bring it despite walking past our table multiple times. We had to ask another employee for a bag. Our plates weren't cleared from the table until the desert came out. Our cups were still not cleared from the table. So when we were eating our desert, it was a bit of a hassle because we had these cups in the way. We ordered the triple chocolate meltdown for desert. It was good! The cake was warmer than my steak, which made me more disappointed that my steak was cold.  Not to mention, the coffee never came. It wasn't on the bill, so we didn't care to stay any longer.
