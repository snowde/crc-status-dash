64,Dan B.,"Manhattan, NY",582,475,309.0,5.0,2012-11-05,I've been to many Applebee's restaurants and I know this is a chain and it's not an over the top experience but the service is amongst many restaunts above par.  The managers are aware of everything going on and they greet each table.  I've been coming to this location since the day it opened its doors and I really enjoy this location.  I come here on Sundays to watch the Giants.  This location has over a dozen flat screens throughout the bar area and then some.  I would recommend this place for the fast and quick service and the amazing people who work there.  I truely believe it's the people who add the value to a restaurant establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=60,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804

No worries however as my Steak Fajitas were very delicious and piping hot. My only complaint was the tortillas were sticky and that made them almost break as I tried to devour my feed.

Either they are understaffed or not properly trained to deal with a large number of guests.  Came here on a Sunday for drinks and dinner with my hubby, we got our drinks after a substantial wait, ordered our dinner and a half an hour later still no dinner, our waiter was busy and seemed ill prepared for the crowd.  I kindly asked a waitress ""would you mind checking on our meals as our waiter is a bit swamped"", she kindly tilted her head to the side and informed me ""well I'm busy too hunny"".   It didn't take much after that for me to want to leave this establishment. When our waiter got around to us we requested the check to pay for our drinks, that in turn took another 15 or so minutes, with him returning to tell us he is getting the manager and will be right with us. By this time i'm hungry and fuming!  Manager finally arrives and wants to know who the waitress is, I didn't see the purpose in telling him so I again asked for the chick, he was dismissive in his behavior, telling us not to worry about the drinks as he turned his back to us and huffed away.

One employee held the door for us and smiled.  We were taken to our table and discovered the table top was dirty and sticky, and trash underneath the table. I informed an employee and she (very kindly) let the hostess know and we were told we could move down a table, which we did, only to discover another dirty table, so we moved down one more. This table was clean on top and underneath, but just a little sticky.  Our waiter Tony came by, and was very nice, and took our drink orders. Then he came back and took our food orders. Good customer service from Tony throughout the meal. The manager, Marco, came by at one point and asked how everything was. We said ""fine"" but didn't tell him about the previous table situation. I don't know why, he seemed nice, but in the moment you hate to make a fuss.  Regarding our food, it was great. We ordered the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese, the All American Burger, and two kids meals.

I ordered the pepper crusted sirloin with whole grains. The picture in the menu made it look so amazing and delicious my mouth watered. Upon receiving my meal, I was completely let down. The plate was messy. The sirloin steak was so small i ate it in 5 bites and it was over salted. There wasn't much grains on my plate either. I usually leave a restaurant with leftovers but I finished my meal and was still hungry. Maybe cuz this is considered a healthy dish and they wanna keep it under 550 calories but it was not a normal person portion. My husband ordered the brew pub philly with a side of sweet potato fries and mayo on the side. They put his side of mayo on my plate so we were confused if it was a sauce for my meal for if it was his mayo. They brought him another side of mayo and the mayos did not have the same consistency.
