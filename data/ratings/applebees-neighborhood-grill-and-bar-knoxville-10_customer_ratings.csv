15,D L.,"Ooltewah, TN",0,13,,1.0,2014-06-20,"I was genuinely surprised that my experience here was so bad. The hostess who seated us and gave us our menus was coughing without covering her mouth and wiping her nose with her hand before touching the menus. She continued to walk around and cough and sneeze and wipe snot all over her hands the entire time we were there. It was disgusting and we should have taken that as our cue to leave. We waited 10 minutes to give our drink order, another 10 minutes for our drinks and then ordered our food. They weren't very busy...there were maybe 7 other tables. An hour went by, no food. New customers came in, sat down, and had their food, and we STILL didn't have our food. Three different employees assured us they would check on our food and apologized for the wait. Then one lady came out and asked us what we ordered. I'm assuming she did this because they didn't even KNOW what we ordered. After about and hour and a half after we ordered, we got our food. The kitchen manager came out and apologized. The food was great and our bellies were happy again. But then we got our bill. They charged us full price! I was shocked. After forgetting our order and  making us wait over an hour before addressing the problem, I really expected to get some sort of discount or SOMETHING. Nope. Nada. We won't be going back. Like I said, the food was great. But after dealing with ol' snotty hands and waiting through three Christmases to get our food, while watching other people come in and eat and leave, I just don't think I have the endurance to ever sit through that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
12,Bridget M.,"Knoxville, TN",0,1,,2.0,2014-07-13,"We were seated quickly- waiter asked us if we had been greeted.  We wanted the Oriental salad on their 2/$20. We were told by the waiter that they had run out of the ingredients that morning and weren't serving it. He said he would give us more time. Ordered the mozzarella sticks- he came by 3 times and said he would check on them. They came out and they were lukewarm, and the marinara was served in plastic disposable cups. No serving cups? We ordered ribs and  fried shrimp. Ribs were overlooked and extra sauce had been poured on. The shrimp were overlooked and the cocktail sauce was in a plastic disposable cup again. The cole slaw was in a styrofoam cup! I overheard the waiter tell another table he wished the kitchen was better... Don't think I will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
6,Dean C.,"Knoxville, TN",27,142,137.0,4.0,2015-06-11,The food was good and the service was fast. I had stopped going to this Applebee's because it started to suck. My mom wanted me to take her here for dinner. I reluctantly agreed and was pleasantly surprised. They must have changed managers... it was much better and I'll start going again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
9,Pat N.,"Knoxville, TN",16,7,4.0,3.0,2015-07-29,"Still a good place to eat. Tuesday was a slow night so we had good service. Everything was good except for my daughter's pasta. It was okay, but this is not their speciality. The chicken dishes are good. Ribs are fine. Overall nice dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
11,Amy P.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,,1.0,2015-12-24,The food was good but my husband has a serious tree nut allergy  and even though he and I both ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken which according to their allergen information isn't supposed to have any tree nuts we ended up at the hospital that evening. Thankfully we had an epi pen and there was a hospital close by so he was ok but I wouldn't advise eating here if you have a food allergy. Someone isn't being too careful in the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
10,Lexan O.,"Knoxville, TN",1,17,2.0,2.0,2016-02-16,"We only went to Applebee's because there is nothing else in this area that interested us. We needed a quick bite while I was waiting for LensCrafters to finish making my glasses. When we walked in the first thing I noticed is that it was cold. Today is a dreary cloudy damp day, and I think they had the air on! Not a huge deal, so we waited for the hostess. She was devoid of personality but efficient, very robotic. As we looked over the menu the server arrived. Anthony was the one bright spot in this whole experience, which is why I wanted to congratulate him by name. I have celiac disease so I asked him about a few of the menu items. He was honest, telling us that it was his third day on the floor, so he made a list of my questions and took them to the kitchen. He returned with the answers and our beverages (I highly recommend the pomegranate lemonade) and I had to pick other items because everything I was interested in contained wheat in some form. (They do not have a gluten free menu, which would have been hugely helpful.) He was patient and helpful, and I finally selected a portobello swiss burger, no bun, with the addition of grilled onions, and sweet potato fries. My husband got a bacon cheddar burger with their house made chips. It took almost forty minutes for our burgers to arrive. Two tables were seated, served and left before we had our food. I guess we ordered the wrong items. Anywhooo, his bun was badly burned; he had to scrape the charcoal off so he could eat it. The bacon was floppy and barely warm, his cheese half melted. My burger was swimming in a pool of grease, there were three tiny slices of mushroom under a layer of lukewarm half melted swiss, and the burger was cooked within inches of it's life even after I specified I wanted it pink (they only give you the choice of pink or no pink). The sweet potato fries were really good, as were his chips. Anthony was attentive, refilling our drinks and checking to see if everything was okay. No, I didn't tell him about the issues with the food. We had waited so long to get it that it just wasn't worth waiting for it to be prepared again. We finished quickly, tipped him well and left, agreeing to never darken their doorstep ever again. Oh, and as I write this I've got heartburn from hell from all the grease. Nope, never again. If Anthony hadn't been there it would have been a one star experience for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
5,Chad M.,"Oak Ridge, TN",134,6,,1.0,2016-04-23,"The service here was terrible! Our food was over cooked, and the manager came and apologized to us for it MULTIPLE times. The order was re-cooked and then was still not right! The server was filling up our drinks with 'mysterious cups.' Unsanitary and a little too mysterious for us!! Only then did we find a long curly hair intertwined in one of our entrees!! Disgusting! At least the manager was gracious, but not enough to comp the WHOLE meal. And then the server chased us out of the restaurant to retrieve her PEN!!!! (That we didn't have but her manager that took it with the receipt.) Just a bad experience all the way around!! But the person I was dining with, was a food critic and travel writer so......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
8,Alexis T.,"Dandridge, TN",0,5,,5.0,2016-05-09,"Came here for a little date night with my significant other. He got the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger & I got the 4 Cheese Mac n Cheese Honey BBQ Chicken Tenders Pasta (New on the menu). The food was fantastic and well cooked. Our waitress was very polite, too. Prices aren't too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
7,Amanda K.,"Knoxville, TN",106,20,,2.0,2016-05-20,This place has gotten worse and worse food wise. The servers are nice but the food is just horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
3,Audrey C.,"Knoxville, TN",132,54,51.0,5.0,2016-06-19,"Good food, good prices. There is certainly a niche in the market for a place like Applebee's. The servers and other staff are polite and attentive. In general Applebee's is noisy and tows a fine line between restaurant and bar with the middle of the action. Our food came out quickly and our bartender Shane was fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
0,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",21,18,2.0,3.0,2016-06-27,"I like to go to Applebee's as they have a very good selection on their menu and very good cocktails. I don't drink very often so when I do drink I like to have a nice cocktail. Our server was Laura H. , she was outstanding. When we walked into the restaurant the hostesses were meh. They look like they really weren't enjoying their job at all. This time, the restaurant was really kind of dirty. In all fairness, they did just have a smoke related incident and had to open up all the doors. I ordered the 4 Mac and cheese with spicy pepper chicken fingers and my husband ordered the lemon chicken. The food was okay. This is the Applebee's I usually go to and if it wasn't for excellent service I probably would not go back as the restaurant and the bathrooms have really seem to go downhill. But if you're looking for good food at a reasonable price this would be a good place to go. We both had margaritas and they were both very good. They do need to clean up the restaurant a little bit here as I've seen it a lot cleaner and has not been that long since I've been there. The restaurant has plenty of handicap parking as well as being handicapped accessible. The atmosphere is great for families as well as business meetings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
4,Billy E.,"Missouri City, TX",0,60,1.0,3.0,2017-01-03,"It's Applebee's. They've decided to not attempt to provide good food or good service, just okay food and okay service. This particular experience was relatively positive. The waiter was pleasant and prompt so 4 stars for service, but the food brings it back down to 3 stars - its just poor quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
2,Chris M.,"Winder, GA",1,26,1.0,1.0,2017-03-15,"This is the absolute worst. Maybe the worst restaurant experience I've had actually. Late review, but my wife and I here on a college basketball Saturday, and every single TV was on some dirt biking event. Actually every tv, not just an exaggeration, everywhere you looked was on that. Now, I understand not everyone likes basketball but really? Why would you have multiple TVs if you're showing the same thing on each of them. Prior to being seated, the hostess had no clue what she was doing so the order was very disorganized. Then, we finally got a table, asked for our drinks. We had to actually remind them that there was no silverware on our table several times. It took 15+ minutes to get our water. I politely asked our server if she could change one of the TVs to a game I wanted. Well, of course it took forever and then she flipped it on the wrong channel and then we had to wait God knows how long to finally get it reset. Almost missed the entire first half after getting there 5 minutes before it started. We finally order our food, and it takes over 30 minutes for her to even acknowledge our table again. She didn't even remember we ordered, I was furious, and sarcastically asked "" Do you even have food here, because it doesn't seem like you ever give people any."" It was horrible service all night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
1,Jerry L.,"Knoxville, TN",0,8,3.0,1.0,2017-04-16,"This was my first and last visit to the east town Applebee's. I sat at the bar, because no one ever came to the host station. After order a beer, the keg blew and the bartender sat down 1/2 a beer and said she would pour the other half after the keg was changed out....I never got the beer and when we asked about it they wanted to charge us more. Not only did that happen, but we waited for 10 minutes before we ever received menus. The bartender never came and checked on us so we eventually had to order from someone else. They must have seen the frustration in our face. When we looked for  our bartender she was just chilling in the corner on her phone or talking to one random guy.  The food was terrible. I honestly believe any of the chain fast food restaurants would have better presentation. Someone needs to step in and take care of these issue before this place ends us closing too. Update: the manager and John addressed our concerns and comped the meal. It's just sad the the bartender has continually acted in this manner (every time my partner has went there) and we ended up going across the road to get som fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-10,,,,,
