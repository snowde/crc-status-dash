25,Jeff S.,"Austin, TX",169,202,641.0,3.0,2012-11-06,"Applebees is what it is in terms of glorified fast food chain restaurants. I live in Kyle, TX, & there isn't a whole lot of selection when it comes to dining out here. Granted, there is a little bit of everything here: Good BBQ, run-of-the mill chinese, mediocre tex-mex & Mexican restaurants but nothing to the caliber of Austin or San Marcos.  On the menu, it's the typical generic staples as found in most Applebees. The bar area is nice & new & the bartenders/waitstaff is friendly & attentive. Beer selection is your typical Budweiser & Coors product but does have a variety of their different beers both on tap & in bottles. The dining area of the restaurant is very clean as expected of a brand-new restaurant. The walls are littered with various posters representing Kyle, Buda, & Hays County youth sports to give it a hometown feel.  In a town like Kyle, a restaurant like Applebees is a big deal & definitely a smart move for the local franchise owner. Even after the ""new"" rubs off, this place will always have a packed house. At least until the next big thing comes along!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
49,Jack P.,"Kyle, TX",0,34,4.0,1.0,2012-12-31,"My first observation was that all the servers appeared to be very young and inexperienced. My wife and I ordered the 9oz steak which tasted odd. It wasn't very hot when it came out and my wife couldn't eat hers at all. She ordered the honey BBQ ribs to replace the steak and they were drowning in sauce and also tasted off. Our server advised us that sometimes their ""chefs"" rush the food out to complete the orders and sometimes send them out under cooked. I usually steer away from these chain restaurants but thought I would give our new local chain a chance.

After 15 minutes of waiting I called in and told the person I was waiting and that no one had come out. I was told they were bagging the food and would be right out. I was among 4 other people outside waiting. I waited another 5 minutes and called again. Chris on the phone told me I could just walk inside. I said that is not the point of car side to go. I asked to speak to the manager and was put on hold. After another 3 minutes on hold and no one walking outside I hung up and drove away, I called again and asked for the manager. Chris asked me why I needed to speak with the manager and I said I was not happy with the car side to go, he put me on hold again and I waited for 15 minutes. I hung up and called again. Ivan answered and said we are busy you will have to wait.  He then HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!  I can't believe this!!! I don't care how busy the restaurant is, that is just unprofessional. My old store was always polite, on time, and professional.  After moving to Kyle I was hoping to get the same service as I did in Austin. I will never visit this store again. I am shocked and outraged that this type of customer service.  I thought about calling back to the store and speaking to the manager again, but with employees like that, whats the manager going to be like.  I am so disappointed that I have filed a complaint with the corporate office.  anything short of a direct apology is a waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2?start=40,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

I have also learned that they cannot ever cook a baked potato right. I almost always have to send mine back to have them microwave it so it is soft. Regardless of being cold and undercooked potato the atmosphere and customer service is good. Ive never caught an attitude from anyone when I have asked them to rewarm or recook my food, they are always very happy to oblige.

I got the riblets basket with fries. I asked for the chipotle sauce. Riblets were not only greasy, but every bite I took had a bone I had to remove from my mouth.

9,Joseph C.,"Austin, TX",76,1,,1.0,2016-09-01,"I will chew my arm off before entering this establishment again.  Bar service- non existent. A lazy bartender with              zero skills and a vinegar attitude.  Cleanliness - dirty and disgusting.  Food- sub par, the apps tasted like frozen fare.  Atmosphere- Applebee's.. Obviously lame.  Location - strip mall in Kyle - convenient for locals.  Service/ hospitality - slow, horrible, uninspired. the unfortunate reality was that it seemed as the service had no ability to multi task. It felt like everyone hated working there, and they hated you for witnessing.  I never make reviews, but this place blows. I feel compelled to share. This place needs to hit delete and start over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
22,Mimi L.,"Lockhart, TX",0,6,,5.0,2016-09-16,"I just placed a To-Go order via phone, but Google maps has the wrong phone number; it called a CA location. I was frustrated because it's Friday night, and I just knew we'd have to wait another 20+ mins. The manager of this store was very understanding and expedited our order which he brought out very swiftly! Thanks for the excellent customer service! The CA location was also very patient and understanding about the mishap. I reported the issue through Google maps, so hopefully they correct it ASAP to avoid anyone else the inconvenience. Next time, I'll use YELP!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
4,Jim O.,"Austin, TX",8,219,17.0,4.0,2016-09-22,"I seldom write reviews on chains because ya either like them or you don't but Justin the host was particularly personable. However I've a real problem with their ""Presto"" system of ordering and paying.   Luckily a live person took our order but I don't know her name because it wasn't on the emailed receipt! Sorry Applebee's but I can get food a lot of places. One of the pleasures of dining is the human interaction!  The more you rely on Presto the less I'll be visiting your restaurant.  Yes the value is good as well as the food, but if it weren't for Justin I would have give this place a lower rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

8,Shay K.,"Kyle, TX",34,54,53.0,1.0,2016-12-17,"This is for the Curbside service only.  Our experiences in side have been consistently good. Used a $5 voucher tonight due to the last Curbside order being severely under cooked.  Tonight's order was wrong again, and the manager (John?) wanted to talk in circles and apparently he is not that familiar with the burger menu; not to mention he checked the order personally so how could it be wrong?  Here's the problem w/ the order that the manager could not seem to comprehend:  The Classic Burger we ordered came with only a bun, burger patty, and cheese.  The Classic Burger, by Applebee's own product description includes ""Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, & Pickles"".  When ordering the Classic Burger, a reasonable customer assumes that lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles will be on the burger, it is not required to request that they be added, because it comes with the burger.  John's argument is that the order instructions only stated ""no pink"" (which is was pink by the way), ""add cheddar cheese"", and a side of fries"".  When placing the Classic Burger online, the only options regarding lettuce, tom, onion, & pickles is to ""remove"" them....adding is not even an option BECAUSE THEY COME WITH THE BURGER!.  How about a refund for that burger at least? The other burger, The American Standard did indeed have the lettuce, tom, onion, and pickles as we selected to ""add"".  Good job there. Unfortunately, the ""no pink"" request was not done.  And ""bacon"" that is mixed in with the onion was so little that there was no discernible bacon taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

Went in and asked how much the coors lights are, was told $1.50 like the previous times I was there. Then I got the bill and they ended up being $2.59.... thanks for the wrong price.

It was just after 10 so we ordered a bunch of half price apps and the food was really good. The best part of our experience though was Kayla. She is a great bartender. I've been bartending for 20 years and I know talent when I see it. You guys are lucky to have her.

1,Chris D.,"Wimberley, TX",425,93,19.0,1.0,2017-10-09,"I was very upset on my last visit to Applebee's. I ordered the 2 for $20.  I asked if I could substitute the burger listed on the deal for a burger of IDENTICAL price.  I was told that I could substitute the same priced burger if I paid an additional $1 because it had an egg on it.  I tried to explain that the burger (egg included) had the exact same price as the one on the list, but was told again that it would cost an additional dollar because of the egg. Tell me there is a $1 charge for ordering off the list - don't tell me it is because of the egg. The burger doesn't cost more because of an egg - I could order either one for the same price. This whole encounter was so ridiculous.  If logic is not going to be a part of the rationale for doing something, then please don't try to justify things with logic. Just say its $1 more because it is your policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
2,Santee J.,"Kyle, TX",4,35,115.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"This review is for their carside to go service. You're supposed to be able to order online and they will bring it out to your car.  Tried to order a burger and fries. Something is obviously wrong with their website design. There is a required section to ""customize your fries"". I don't need to custimize my fries. Just want regular fries. Since this is a required section I have to select something to place an order  My wife chose the green beans then called the store and explained that I wanted fries. They said ok and said our order would be ready by 8:06pm. Drove up to the restaurant and waited. Finally got my order at 8:30 and you guessed it, green beans instead of fries. Can't imagine they've been offering this service too long with these kinds of simple mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kyle-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
