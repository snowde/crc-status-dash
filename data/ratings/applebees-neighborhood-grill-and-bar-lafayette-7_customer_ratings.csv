10,Freddie O.,"Lafayette, LA",0,1,,1.0,2013-09-09,"I was not pleased with my visit to Applebees on Saturday. My girlfriend and I got there at 12:30 am on the dot to be greeted by locked doors and a waitress whom was cleaning the tables and just gawked at us when we tried to open the door before returning to table cleaning. I wasn't pleased at all so I called the restaurant up and asked why are they locked up when it's only 12:30. I was greeted on the phone by an employee named Ashley who was full of attitude and barked ""WE'RE CLOSED"" . I asked to speak to a manager and spoke to a guy named Daryl who was acting as if he was oblivious to the fact that both front doors were locked. He said ""o no, that's just the car-side to go that's closed; the doors are locked?! Really?"" ""I'll have them open it up for you all""; to which I replied, no, that's okay, we're already on the road. We've left. He said ""O, OK, bye!"" and hungup. This is not a common practice at every applebees I hope...Ridiculous. Not pleased by the service or lack there of...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
8,Evan E.,"Lafayette, LA",11,1,,1.0,2013-11-11,"Last time I went here I said NEVER AGAIN!!! My job have out Applebee's gift cards so I decided I'd give them another try.Long story short, NEVER AGAIN, you couldn't pay me to go here. Bad service, mediocre food, bad service(just making sure to let you know the service is bad), and and the waitress said after not getting me any refills or anything that she'd like a good tip because she had to work late. NEVER AGAIN!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
6,Luke B.,"Downtown, Memphis, TN",1,15,,1.0,2014-12-29,"It was so bad we didn't even order food. I went for a late night app and drinks and half of the tables were covered with dirty dishes. We sat at the bar and noticed dirty dishes all across snd behind the bar, a few of them had flys. One of the most disgusting things I've seen in a ""restaurant"" in awhile. We decided to leave before even looking at a menu. Knock this place down and start fresh with something better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
9,Robert E.,"Baton Rouge, LA",10,33,2.0,1.0,2015-02-07,Horrible experience and we never even got a table. Hostess told us it would be a ten minute wait. Checked with the hostess 20 minutes later and she said it would be another 30 minutes. We walked out and noticed over 8 empty tables through the windows. Horrible service. I would never recommend this Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
5,Christine T.,"Crowley, LA",0,1,,4.0,2015-07-02,I love the new menu!  The won ton  tacos are the best.  If you haven't been there lately you must give it another shot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
7,Jason M.,"Youngsville, LA",4,3,,5.0,2016-03-17,"In a time where customer service has gone out of the window in most cases,  I was more than happy with Applebee's.  The manager comes check on tables as well as attentive hostess and waiters.  But besides the very good customer service,  the food was the best I've had in quite sometime.  I'm a steak snob,  and believe that only a ribeye is a real steak but Applebee's changed my mind on that.  I ordered the Bourbon sirloin and it was cooked perfectly as well as seasoned perfectly.  I damn near licked my plate clean!!!!  I've had real Steakhouses who did not do as good of a job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
3,Jared R.,"Scott, LA",17,11,4.0,5.0,2016-07-27,"Applebee's has made a very drastic change since my previous visit. New menu and looks all around. Definitely made a 180 with this restaurant. I ordered the crispy bourbon chicken and it was fantastic. We had the make your own trio of quesadillas, cheeseburger egg rolls and crispy tacos. Everything came out quick and flavors were on point. If you were disappointed with Applebee's as I once was I suggest you give them another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
1,Vicey R.,"Scott, LA",24,120,253.0,5.0,2016-09-01,Applebee's have revamped their menu and customer service and surprisingly it's great!! I have been back a few times since they improved and I like the place. Lunch time everything is done quick and hot for you and I think they stand a change now in Lafayette.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
4,Bryce D.,"Carencro, LA",9,4,2.0,5.0,2016-11-07,Great  experience  I enjoyed how the waiter's and waitress's are happy at any point of the day also good to fill up your stomach for the night also makes a great date to go on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,

0,Ernie T.,"Lake Worth, FL",94,38,280.0,5.0,2017-12-18,"Me and friends went here to this AppleBee to pregame before going to a Popeyes chicken buffet , informed by friends that there's $1 Long Island Iced Tea(LIT) special at the AppleBee. When we arrived to the location our friends are already here , the waitress immediately came by , she is very nice and very attentive. She often comes back asking us if we need anything refills or need another Long Island . We also ordered mozzarella sticks and chips and salsa just so we can also make it to Popeye chicken buffet. The $1 drinks are on the weak side and they are small. For the four of us we ordered 10 of the LIT and it was a very good deal to have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lafayette-7,,,,,
