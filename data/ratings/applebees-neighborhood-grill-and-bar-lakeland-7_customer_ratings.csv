32,Chelsea P.,"Lithia, FL",81,50,6.0,2.0,2014-05-10,"So this Applebee's location was very sub-par. I don't know who decided servers at a restaurant should dress so skimpy, it's not Hooters.  It took about 3 minutes for our server Kim to come to our table and another 3 minutes for our non-alcoholic drinks. It wasn't even busy for a Saturday, no wait so no excuse for slow service.  Food as always was pretty good although our appetizer (spinach art dip) didn't come with the salsa as it is supposed to, we had to ask for it. Our drinks were empty for a bit as well and we had to ask for refills, not a crime but if it's not busy they should never get empty.  Next we asked for the hockey game to be put on the tv, which is was until the table behind us came in and asked for the baseball game, we asked for it to be changed back to the game and while Kim tried her best to get the tv changed it was not.  The entire time we were sat in the restaurant the manager walked around but never greeted us, or asked how anything was or apologized for the tv not being changed back to the game.  While Kim did her best with the tv situation, the sub-par service was enough to keep me away from this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeland-7?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

Crystal came over and asked how everything was, my mother politely expressed  how tough the meat was but didn't want to get it remade. Crystal insisted she did and it was no problem.... so she sent it back and she said the Manager would bring it out. Thr Manager was a RUDE ASS. He placed it down.. no introduction... stood  there and told her to try it if its what she want. It was the SAME CRAP... over cooked and tough but she smiled and said its still tough but its okay don't worry about it.. he shrugged and said ok sure.. and walked away. Crystal came back over and asked again how we are and we told her what happen.. wanted the check. She said she would take it off the bill we said no don't worry about it we Will pay. .. she took it off anyway. She went out of her way to please us and her service alone was great.

Apparently you can only order appetizers and desserts with them. It also has games on it which I thought would be free but is actually $.99. That kinda sucks.  We shared the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which was very good. The chips were light and airy and salted just right. They weren't oily like they usually are. I don't remember the dip appetizer coming with salsa before but I guess now it does. The salsa tasted freshly made and I ate it all. We both ordered  the Shrimp and Broccoli Cavatappi because what's not to love? Pasta under 500 calories with lotsa grilled shrimp, broccoli florets on a light cream sauce? Makes you not feel bad for not ordering a salad so late at night.  We tried to use it to order refills but they never came. We had to use it to signal our server to come back to the table to get our refills.

Seems the economy has hit my favorite chain (even though the place was packed) which was apparent in how they skimped on the food.  (Brisket nachos might as well have been tortilla chips with a few chunks of meat and little cheese but plenty of lettuce. The appetizer shrimp was not coated all the way and was something to be desired.  The beer cheese and pretzels would have been great had there been more than two sticks.

Just very sad to see how far DOWNHILL this company has gone. I work for one in Michigan 13 years ago for 3 years.

Our food was ready and waiting the moment I showed up but since I didn't prepay by credit card for the food I had to wait for someone to take my money. A server told me she would be right with me. I stood in the corner of the restaurant, in everyone's way, waiting... and waiting. Servers kept saying ""excuse me"" and asking if I'd been helped. I explained I just wanted to pay for my food and go, I didn't even need change. 17 more minutes went by and FINALLY the waitress took my money. My food was cold but I was so hungry I still took it.

9,Jason D.,"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",240,167,301.0,2.0,2015-10-11,"I was extremely disappointed with the service from this Applebee's. We were seated promptly and were able to order drinks immediately, but a 10 minute gap between asking for a minute and ordering our food took place.  My wife ordered the 9oz sirloin well done with garlic mash potatoes and broccoli for $15.49. My wife was disgusted by the steak. She complained about it being tasteless and extremely chewy. My wife normally never complains, but this time was different. She had me try a piece and it was definitely horrible. The steak tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave and was indeed tasteless.  I ordered one of their new burgers. It was a blazin Texas burger with onions and jalapeños cooked into the burger patty topped with shredded pork, white cheddar, and a bbq type sauce. This burger was on point. My taste buds exploded from the flavor. I rarely finish my meal, but had to finish this one. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a small kick of spice mixed with a bbq style burger. The service was extremely annoying with wait times. I had my water filled about 10 minutes after I finished it. We only had our plates cleared when or triple chocolate melt came out from a different waitress. We waited about another 10 minutes after we finished for the waitress to apologize to us for the long wait. We then waited another 10 minutes for the hostess to present us with the check. We then waited about 15 minutes for the check to be picked up. The restaurant was not very busy for this type of service. The waitress was extremely kind, just seemed like she forgot about us half the time. I normally tip 20-25%, but I had to stick with only 15% on this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeland-7,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

Awesome! The fried were also pretty awesome! Well, they say, stuff always tastes better when you're drunk but it was actually very good food. The place is also pretty inviting and so was the service, pretty attentive, friendly and just were doing there job right!

11,Sara B.,"Toronto, Canada",26,59,115.0,2.0,2016-01-27,"I generally like the Applebee's chain. It's never my first choice but I do seem to end up there every so often when dining out with other people choosing.  Once you realize this is not a place to order a nice steak (unless you're one of the lucky ones that gets it cooked properly), and just order the most popular dishes on the menu, you'll be fine! The 2 for $20 deals are a good value if you're looking for cheap. The Double Crunch seemed to be a popular choice the last time I went -- but you can't really screw up fried food, right?! Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos = yum! I also ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad. It was good too, but dry and I had to ask for more dressing. Someone said the Riblets tasted ""old"" and not freshly cooked. Another person sent her steak back.  The Grilled Shrimp 'n Spinach Salad is usually my go-to. Most of the Apps & Bar Snacks are tasty.  The service wasn't great at this location either. They forgot a lot of stuff, didn't offer refills, we had to ask for take out containers and they didn't try to upsell us on dessert at all -- and a few of us would have ordered! We also had a birthday at the table and I told our waitress but nothing was done. We waited for a bit after we finished eating, but just ending up leaving.

23,Guilherme B.,"Orlando, FL",147,99,96.0,2.0,2016-06-09,"Good food, sorta what you would expect from Applebee's but not the best service. For starters, the parking situation in this location isn't the best. It took me a couple tries to find a spot. I walked in to the restaurant to meet my parent's and my stepdad's parents for dinner. The specials at Applebee's are good (2 for 1 what up!!) but our experience with our server wasn't the best. My first complaint is that they would't allow us to split our drinks. So it was two for us but they brought both to the table at the same time, which is kinda bad when you're drinking white wine or beer. The waitress refused to bring them back later on. For my appetizer, I ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The dip was good. The chips, however, were so broken. It legit seemed as if they got the bottom of the bag and gave me all the broken chips. Not ideal at all. The saving grace of the meal was the burger I got. It was cooked perfectly and the fries were good. The waitress, however, was lost when I asked her for the burger to be served on the ciabatta bread. She didn't know what that was. You'd expect your server to know the items on the menu but that wasn't really the case on my visit. Like I said in the beginning if the review, good food, but poor execution.

8,Joshua H.,"Lakeland, FL",0,19,61.0,1.0,2017-10-14,This place sucks! If it wasn't for the $1 margaritas my ass wouldn't be here. Service didn't exist.  This could explain why I haven't been here in years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeland-7,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
1,Andrea R.,"Springfield Township, NJ",182,24,23.0,2.0,2017-10-29,We came on a Sunday a little after noon. We were sat very quickly. They weren't that busy. Not sure if they were having an off day or if it is normal at this restaurant to have patchy service- we are from out of town-I know there's always underlying reasons for poor service.  The food we got was as expected. Except my father in laws chicken sandwich didn't get to him till we were all done with our food. They took it off the bill and made it right. Manager was awesome and so was our waitress  But things just kept going wrong. My daughter received her corn dog still frozen in the middle. That again was quickly rectified.  But my one major issue with the chain itself is that they are NOT dietary issue friendly. They have taken off all non- dairy salad dressings- ( literally they don't even carry Italian anymore!). The manager brought me the book of ingredients and helped me find the dressings. As I was looking she did say that even though they said non dairy they could not commit to it being completely dairy free.  But as I was looking the only dairy free option was spicy. I told her how disappointed I was. And how oil and vinegar is not a viable option. They need to put more thought into people w dietary issues. I told her to bring my complaint to upper management because really the options were very poor and if you can't tell me something won't make me sick- I probably will not eat here ever again.  So the manager was awesome but it seems that the issues here at stemming from upper management and corporate. I plan on calling the number on the receipt and  informing them of my issues today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeland-7,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
