7,Lincoln P.,"Lakeville, MN",17,29,40.0,4.0,2013-04-03,Good place to eat. Friendly staff. Avoid Friday nights during Lakeville football season.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
5,Mark R.,"Lakeville, MN",88,148,45.0,3.0,2013-08-05,"Applebees is Applebees. Generally pretty consistant on all fronts. This one was ok too. Good points? Service was good and the manager rushed out our order nice and hot. Bad point? Although it was getting late, they were turning off the bars sign lights which darkened the place quite a bit. Its just a pull chain light so there is no great time issue for closing.  I expect it at a small divey bar, not a commercial chain like Applebees. Maybe just an over zealous peeve of mine.  Just had a couple of apps; not impossible, but hard to mess up a cheese stick. Just the same they were good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
4,Deanna R.,"Ham Lake, MN",1,22,64.0,3.0,2015-04-26,"The food was great, the restaurant is nice looking, but the service was very slow. It took about 30 minutes before our server came over to take our order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
8,Amanda S.,"Florence, TX",0,17,3.0,4.0,2015-08-02,"After a long drive ( 8hrs) , I honestly picked Applebee's because I didn't want to go any further. My waitress was super friendly, wine was yummy but the Cedar plank Salmon, over cooked. I should have ordered a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
3,Ryan S.,"Lakeville, MN",0,39,,1.0,2015-08-26,"I'd love for this to be a review of the food we intended to order, but we never made it that far into the process. After showing up on a rainy Monday night when there were many tables open, a visibly flustered host sat us at a table. After a few minutes a server came over and took our drink order (Two kids Arnold Palmers and two waters.) My wife and daughter came back from the bathroom and looked at the menu. At this point we'd been seated for about 10 minutes and had decided on what to order the twins, and what we'd be eating. After our server (again, visibly flustered) dropped off the drinks, my two year old daughter started telling her she wanted grilled chicken and apple sauce, but the server walked off and didn't bother to acknowledge that we were ready to order.  My wife was fairly upset at this point as we'd been there going on 15 minutes. (not busy. lots of open tables and tables finishing up.) The server came back towards the table but got sidetracked by another table looking to pay. Meanwhile, the manager dropped something off at the table across from us and looked at us and walked right on by. We even ensured to make eye contact to let her know we were there and needed something, but she cruised on past.  She did, however, make our server bus a table two over from us and muttered something about needing to pick up the pace... Not sure how bussing a table in a restaurant full of empty tables should have been her priority when we were looking to order, but apparently it was far more important.  After she dropped the dishes off in the kitchen she came back out and stopped at a table that had their food and asked if they'd like anything else, to which they replied ""napkins."" My wife said that at this point if she didn't take our order (going on 20 minutes now.) before she brought them napkins, that we were leaving... Not sure why she couldn't have taken our order then dropped of napkins, but apparently prioritizing isn't her strong suit.  This was, by far, the worst service I've ever (not?) received at a restaurant before. I know, I know, it's only an Applebee's but still... The manager shouldn't have been so concerned about one dirty table in a restaurant full of open tables, and the server needed to multitask a little harder than she was apparently capable of...  We offered to pay for the kids' drinks with another server who told us not to bother, and we left.  I'm not sure that we'll bother going back. There's another one about three more miles up the road. We'll try our luck there next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
2,Isaac H.,"Lakeville, MN",0,5,,3.0,2017-03-03,"There is a waitress who treats customers very poorly.  The food has always been warm and good.  Obviously not above mediocre, but some staff members are very friendly.  Their biggest problem is that sometimes it takes 30 min for ur waiter to come to your table.  Wouldn't recommend unless you're coming for half price apps, which is the only reason I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
1,Garrett Z.,"Apple Valley, MN",106,335,536.0,2.0,2018-01-04,"It's Applebees and I came in for half price apps so I wasn't expecting much. I second what everyone else here is saying, man they are SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW. They will also try and say that they are slow because they are busy but when you look around you notice that the place isn't even a quarter full and it is a weekday night so yeah....no not cutting it with that lie. I get better and friendlier service from a fast food joint by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakeville-3,,,,,
