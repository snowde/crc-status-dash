19,Clarence P.,"Accokeek, MD",0,52,,3.0,2012-06-25,"Average place for a chain.  We could not get a seat that we requested because it was another servers turn to get the customer. It't clear that the servers are more important than the customers. We were seated near the entrance where the staff seemed to want to gather and talk. Sent the drink back to be corrected, but the new one was just as bad. As I said.....typical  chain ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
15,Celeste H.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,2.0,1.0,2015-05-13,"This place is horrible! I am not sure who to blame, management, the servers, everyone?? A simple quick meal turned into only half your order being placed and when you give your server your card early because you need to leave, she brings you back a receipt with items on it that you didn't even have.  I understand it's Applebee's but take pride in your job!!! Do not go here, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,

14,Dwalt H.,"Cobb Island, MD",1,17,6.0,3.0,2015-08-17,"Service is usually pretty good. The food has always been good as well. This location is dirty at times, especially at the bar. The drinks and beer are very over priced...8-10$ for any mixed drink and beer starts at $5.25!! Way over priced beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
13,Crystal T.,"Indian Head, MD",0,1,,1.0,2015-09-15,"Can not give zero stars.  Two people had lunch there yesterday -both people ended up with bad GI issues if you know what I mean.  Stay away, health dept. needs to shut them down. Beware, we ate salad and two different chicken dishes. Not safe to eat here at this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
18,K B.,"La Plata, MD",0,12,4.0,4.0,2015-10-19,I love going to this place. Is not too far from me. When I usually go I sit at the bar to have a late night drink. Besides that I get to watch TV. The food is good and it comes out timely. This is also a great place for family and friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
16,Joann A.,"Port Tobacco, MD",0,19,,1.0,2015-12-13,Ok went in no hostess after standing there for quite a while- then sat at bar side because looked like the hostess was gone waited-waited and waitresses walked by ignored us. Two employees sat at the table right by us and ignored us while they chatted- we finally got up and left because-while the boss is away the staff does play!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
9,Nicholas A.,"White Plains, MD",100,200,94.0,1.0,2016-08-02,"What an awful experience. I went with the family to Apple Bee's for dinner, we were seated right away, and drink orders was placed. Overall as you can see things appear to be going great!!  The building itself look newer, there was a ton of staff running around bringing food, and drinks to tables.  So things look great, until we placed our order. We placed our order 2 Oriental chicken salad, 1 kids grilled cheese, 1 kid chicken tenders, and 2 orders of boneless Buffalo wings.  Wings came out right away, but the other food did not.  We received 1 order of the oriental chicken salad.  20 min later we received 1 kid's grilled cheese.  We attempted to get our servers attention to ask where the rest of our food was, but he was too busy running around helping other tables.  To speed things up, we did not get all our food and a full hour had lapsed.  Our server final comes over to see how we were doing, that is when I explain we are still missing food items.  He quickly runs to the back to check on the rest of our order and informs me that our order got mixed up with another table, and they are making it right away.  I was doing my best to stay professional, and I requested for to go boxes along with the missing food items.  The server informs me he will talk to the manager on what happen to see if he can make changes to our bill.  Manager wanted nothing to do with me, or to apologize.  The server then tells me, he will get another manager the assistant to help with bill and to apologize.  The assistant manager did come out to apologize and took off the appetizer for me.  Good gesture, but way too late.  I will not visit this establishment again.  1star is well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
11,Caitlin M.,"Beltsville, MD",5,5,,1.0,2016-08-05,Beyond the most embarrassing experience I ever had. A manager had to research whether or not I was allowed to be served. Don't go to this Applebee's! I am sure there are others in the area that have respect for their customers. Will never set foot in this Applebee's again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
10,Michael K.,"Waldorf, MD",15,43,5.0,1.0,2016-08-14,God the service at this one is terrible. The bartender just acts like she has better things to do. Haven't seen any of the waitresses smile and or bustle. When the service crew makes you feel unwelcome you know a place is about worthless.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
5,Christine N.,"Waldorf, MD",85,123,428.0,4.0,2016-09-13,"I was really worried when I read reviews about this branch, but thankfully I had a good experience. My husband and I ordered off the new menu and we enjoyed our meal, and our server was attentive. However, I noticed that many customers were waiting around for a long time without being served and one couple actually got up and left. The staff didn't Even notice that they had gone. I hope it never happens to me, will be returning to this location again at some point for an updated review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
12,Rupert Eric D.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",14,16,,3.0,2017-01-26,Only my second time in an Applebee's service was great polite and friendly showed up when we needed and complied with all requests with a smile food was served in a timely professional manner it was hot and freshly made and the atmosphere is clean and comfortable however the entree was tough and hard to chew I had the baby back ribs and my lady had the steak and shrimp now when you eat ribs the meat should not be hard to cut the butter knife that I had just didn't do the job and I had to scrape the meat off the bone with my teeth not the way I want to eat my ribs they were dry and chewy when I looked over at my lady the knife she had for her steak looked more like a sword and must have been dull because she was sawing away like a carpenter on a saw horse I tried her steak not only was it hard to cut it was equally hard to chew if we hadn't been ravenously hungry we would have just walked out it was around 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was not busy so there was no excuse for this fail,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
7,Laura L.,"Waldorf, MD",0,17,,4.0,2017-03-31,By far this has been my best experience at Applebee's. Our server Bryan G. was amazing and super  nice. We have been to the one in Waldorf which sucks and I said I would never go to Applebee's again. I tried this Applebee's and it has made me love them again. Service was great from walking in to leaving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
2,Kelley P.,"Fort Washington, MD",2,39,78.0,3.0,2017-04-26,"This is a great spot to hang out with friends or coworkers.  Great drinks, appetizers and desserts. Great atmosphere and the service was awesome.  Before my cup was low they were asking or bringing me another.  They had some great music playing in the background.  Not to loud...just right for hanging out! I will be back with more friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
4,Shuyi C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",170,5,1.0,1.0,2017-06-24,I ordered ribs with broccoli. Broccoli looked like it's been there for weeks (moldy). The ribs barely had any meat on it. Just terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,
0,Neil M.,"Waldorf, MD",32,4,1.0,5.0,2017-07-02,"I loved my past few trips here!  It's under new management and has gotten better each time I came here.  Great servers, fast service and if I do have an issue the managers there have been GREAT!!!  The manager that helped us was Rosaura and she went out of her way to make our dining experience a good one!!  The food there was on point and the atmosphere was pleasant as always!!  I come here quite a bit and will continue to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laplata,,,,,

3,Elvira S.,"La Plata, MD",8,9,,2.0,2017-08-22,The only thing I get there is the shrimp thai salad.  And the last two times I had it to go. I think they forgot to put lettuce in it. It was not good.
