11,Kasey Y.,"Houston, TX",20,138,33.0,2.0,2013-08-04,"Great service from Edmundo, mediocre food, loud atmosphere. We were unfortunately seated next to a large party who were obnoxious and very inconsiderate of the people around them.  I wish this place had a back room for groups to avoid the same situation in the future.  The music was random and awkward, and VERY loud.  The food is very boring and not cooked especially well.  I ordered the bourbon street chicken, and it was so dry and chewy, the potatoes were soaked in grease, the tortilla chips that came with our (delicious) spinach dip were very very greasy, and the $6 ""brownie bite"" dessert is just that.  A BITE.  Edmundo was a great server.  Attentive, quick, polite, and paid a lot of attention to my husband's dietary needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
12,Orly K.,"Laredo, TX",0,2,,3.0,2014-10-04,"Good customer service, food averages about 20-25 minutes of wait time. Food wise, always hot and very well made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
9,Karina B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,12,,2.0,2015-08-10,"When we got there this past friday, we got greeted and seated by the manager, he sat us in a booth near the restroom. We order our drinks and we didn't get them until 15 minutes later, we were asking for our drinks to three diferent waitresses all the time and no one knew where were our drinks. We asked to be moved to another table or booth because there was a foul odor of sewer where we were seating. Our beers were warm so we told our waitress named Rosalinda about it, but she didn't even bother to change our beers or even asked us if we wanted them changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
6,Kristina B.,"Laredo, TX",1,46,61.0,1.0,2015-11-08,Horrible service! I placed an order online went to pick it up. A simple order. The female bartender was so spacy she gave me wrong order. I handed it back told her it was wrong she was rude and said look that guy picked his order up and its right. After 20 mins of waiting she was telling me how much $ applebees made the previous night. I dont care. Received my order got home And It WAS WRONG! I called the manager not much help he sent me a voucher for a next visit. The next visit came around decided to give it another chance. WORSE the ribblets were COLD & my side item was not the side order I wanted. My husbands order was wrong as well. I called AGAIN and spoke to kitchen manger not much help either. The WORSE service and the food is GROSS!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
8,Andrew G.,"Laredo, TX",18,10,,1.0,2015-12-29,"Their service for the most part has been very lousy and some of the waiters and waitresses were incompetent and dorky! Food used to be okay and now it's crap! And it was fun to look at the knick knacks but now some Einstein decided to replace it all with local junk (who cares! That's boring.) Yep, you can pretty much guess this place is not in my favor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
4,Jesse A.,"Eldorado, WI",3,10,12.0,4.0,2016-02-18,It wasn't a bad experience considering how packed it was. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I can empathize  with the waitress .  I can tell she was working as hard as she could . We went in there to enjoy the half price apps .  The food was well made . Hot and fresh . Waitress could not provide me with a receipt when I asked for my copy ... She somehow lost it from our table to the register and back. Overall not the worse Applebee's I've been to. I'm positive I'll come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
10,Yong W.,"Laredo, TX",14,5,,1.0,2016-03-03,our waitress Rose got our order wrong and never came to  check on us. everyone at our table needed refills on drinks and didnt have enough silverware. horrible service. cheesesticks were good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
7,Amy W.,"Dakota City, NE",32,4,,1.0,2016-03-07,"New in town and this was my second time to this Applebee's. Service the first time was horrible but thought I would give it another try...big mistake. Service was still bad. Waiter was not friendly or attentive, drinks needed refilling, order was wrong. Will definitely not be going back again. Worst Applebee's I have ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
5,Shelby W.,"Newport Beach, CA",431,50,6.0,4.0,2016-07-14,"Went for dinner the other night, normally I sit at the bar and would give it 2-3stars, but the bar was full so I decided to get a table. Server was great! Very outgoing and had great knowledge of the menu. She first set down a happy hour menu and told us about all of the late night specials. She took our drink order and had them out very quickly. I ordered the wonton tacos on the happy hour menu and was pleasantly surprised. Came with 4 small tacos that I thought were really good! Crunchy and a good amount of food for an entree (which is what I did). My friend got the specialty steak they were promoting with sweet mash and Mac and cheese. Very good! Steak cooked a little bit over what was ordered but nothing to complain about. Drinks were never empty, and table was cleared in a timely manner. Will definitely be back to test out the bar again someday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
3,Franco B.,"Laredo, TX",15,9,1.0,1.0,2017-03-26,"Last few times I have been here, everything about the experience has been awful. Granted, I don't really expect much out of a chain restaurant, but this was just plain bad. After being sat by the hostess, it took about 15 minutes for anyone to stop by to take a drink order or to even introduce themselves as our waitress. Finally when the waitress arrived, we gave her our entire order because we figured it would be forever before we saw the waitress again. Took them another 15 minutes to bring out an iced tea and a simple LIT; bar was busy, but not to that extent.  Food order came out about 15 or 20 minutes after that, but we were still without even utensils. We ordered 10 wings, mozzarella sticks, and nachos. The wings and nachos tasted like they've been sitting around on a warmer for more than 10 minutes and the mozzarella sticks never came out. When asked for utensils, they came back with food still caked on them from a wash machine that was probably not cleaned the entire shift (I've worked in a restaurant before, the waste basket in the commercial dishwasher needs to be rinsed out every hour or so, to effectively clean). We checked bill on the kiosk, but saw the sticks weren't ordered. Giving the waitress the benefit of the doubt we reordered the mozzarella sticks. After another 15 minutes of waiting, without seeing our waitress, the newly ordered sticks never came either. Finally asked for a manager, who gave the normal ""I was just about to bring them out"" speech. He offered a discount on our next meal, but we won't likely be returning any time soon.  PS, next morning I've been in and out of the restroom dealing with what feels like food poising. Should have known not to touch them after tasting the old fryer grease on the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
0,Jose C.,"Laredo, TX",0,2,,5.0,2017-03-29,"was hoping to get a waitresses number, oh well, good service tho. The food was exceptional and they brought us our drinks shortly before finishing, so we didn't even have to ask for refills, great time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
2,Adan Z.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,2.0,2017-06-03,Unnecessarily long wait time for a small simple desert. Its not rocket science; scoop of icecream + slice of cake = 1-2min ... NOT 10min!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
1,Jose S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-29,The worst service They think they are making you a favor,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-4,,,,,
