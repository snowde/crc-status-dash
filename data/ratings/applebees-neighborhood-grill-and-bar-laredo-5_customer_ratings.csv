3,Jesse A.,"Eldorado, WI",3,10,12.0,2.0,2017-02-19,I usually don't write reviews unless the experience was really good or bad . In this case the experience wasn't the best . First of all once we got seated it took them 20 minutes to assist us . It was a Friday night so I understand it might take a little longer but 20 minutes was a little too much in my opinion . The restroom was horrible . No toilet paper and piss all over the seat . You know what they say you can tell a lot about the kitchen by looking at the restroom.  We got our appetizer and not even 2 minutes later got our main dish . We didn't even enjoy the appetizer . The only reason I'm not given this place 1 star is due to the fact that our waiter Christian apologized for the experience . He was great. Poor guy was working 10 tablets all by himself. I'm sure it was overwhelming. He did his best. I wish this place the best and hope they can turn their performance around quick .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
9,K G.,"Laredo, TX",0,6,1.0,1.0,2017-05-30,Food always has a long wait. Poor waiters were overworked with too many tables to handle.  I've been here twice and each time the reggaeton music was full blast and I couldn't hear anyone at my table. I've never been to an Applebee's that thought it was a Spanish club before  this was a first.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
8,Andrew G.,"Laredo, TX",18,10,,1.0,2017-06-14,"I swear applebees is infamous for hiring retards! I ask for the steak salad with no ranch, no cheese, and with pick de gallo and cilantro (as in the plant) they brought it out and it was slimed with ranch and  cheese and the dimwitted waitress said ""that's cilantro,"" no dummy, that's ranch! If you think cilantro automatically means dressing, you flunked school, lady!  Plus they got mom's order wrong to, my mom asked for cheddar on her burger but it came with American cheese and she was too dumb to say okay and then take it back, she just insisted that there was no difference! Also, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no ketchup, no nothing! It'll be a long time before my mom and I come back here again! Don't ask for Adrianna!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
7,Jaime H.,"Birmingham, AL",50,3,,4.0,2017-06-30,"Yes, I know this is a chain, but we had the best experience ever at this Applebee's. The staff was friendly and extremely attentive. The food was fresh and hot and the taste was throughly enjoyable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
4,Ambrose L.,"Austin, TX",67,10,20.0,1.0,2017-07-03,Worst service. Wasn't even that busy. Waiter is the worst. Ever get such bad service that you decide not to leave a tip before you've even had your meal? That's how bad it is and this is coming from someone who has worked in the service industry before. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
6,Janneth L.,"Laredo, TX",0,4,,2.0,2017-08-02,horrible service no one ever came to ask us for our drinks and weren't ever assigned a waiter until 30 minutes later. servers never attended us properly. I've had my plate for 20 minutes and still silverware. I ever had three different appetizers and had no silverware. VERY DISSATISFIED! we ordered ribs and they didn't tell us they didn't have BBQ until all the other orders were out and one plate was missing took us to complain to manager to get ribs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
1,Dottie F.,"Round Rock, TX",9,44,1.0,1.0,2017-08-26,"Yes I'm piling on the negative reviews. Do you think Applebees corporate would look at these reviews once in a while? We got here at 11:10 AM. Stood in an empty restaurant and waited 10 minutes before somebody showed up to seat us. Waited another 10 minutes for a server. Half of my salad had old, brown, wilted lettuce in it. And then we had to wait 20 minutes to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
2,Courtney M.,"Houston, TX",2,1,2.0,1.0,2017-10-01,"Absolute worst service of any restaurant I've ever been to. I've gone multiple time to see if it has improved. No improvement! Employees are always in the back. You can never get your server. Today we stood at the hostess stand for at least 5 minutes and there was no one to be found. In addition, the music is too loud to hear anything. Will no be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
5,Pabz L.,"Laredo, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-26,Awful service. Waiters aren't very attentive. Food is incorrect on occasion. They need better management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
0,Cindy R.,"Ripley, NY",4,7,3.0,2.0,2018-01-09,"Serves was very slow. I got the ""endless"" ribblets. Huge mistake my food came last. When I asked for a 2nd helping waited 20 more minutes for 2 ribblets. Don't think I will be going back again highly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laredo-5,,,,,
