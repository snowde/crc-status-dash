41,Rob P.,"Bowie, MD",122,36,135.0,1.0,2012-01-05,Sat around the bar area were you should get faster service. We were coming from a long day of shopping. We got menu after 10 mins. Then sat for 25mins before we received the drink order I stopped looking at my watch. I just wanted to get the food and go. The Server seemed to be afraid of  the Bartender. Now this was not our 1st. Or 2nd bad experience with this Applebee's. And the only reason we were back this time was that they had just reopened with a new look and we hoped a new attitude. Well the place looks great.

36,Karim B.,"Atlanta, GA",32,13,,1.0,2012-04-30,"The worst restaurant in business. The only reason they are still running is because there are too many people that are accepting of horrible service because of convenience and price.  Some of the servers acted as if they didn't want to show up to work that day. One of the ""servers"" was walking around with cloth napkins and was dropping them down on random tables haphazardly. Also a server was walking around with her shirt not pulled down displaying her love handles while I was trying to enjoy my beer. Not exactly what I want to see.  The only reason I came here was to meet up with friends. I will never spend money on the food in this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-largo-2?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

59,Tawny E.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",6,35,,4.0,2012-08-15,"So I know that this site is really to glorify the mom and pop's restaurateurs of the world, but I have to give it to America's Neighborhood grill for really stepping up its menu options. The weight watchers menu is excellent and the portions really help with America's expanding waistlines. My friend selected the grilled chipotle-lime shrimp and black bean corn salsa tossed with lime juice and chopped cilantro, served on a mix of grilled zucchini, marinated tomatoes, onions & red peppers with steamed white rice. She actually welcomed the smaller portion of rice. I ordered the most Amazing salad I ve had in quite some time. The fiesta chopped salad  with its black bean corn salsa, roasted red peppers & onions, tortilla strips, white cheddar and spicy jalapeño dressing, chimichurri glazed grilled chicken. I ordered a side of shrimp just for variety. The spicy jalapeno dressing is simply divine. I was so enthralled by this salad that I did not come up for air until half had somehow disappeared from my plate lol.  I had to tell everyone about how good it was and because I just wanted someone to experience what I already knew to be true I brought along my friend.

52,N S.,"Silver Spring, MD",8,26,1.0,1.0,2012-12-14,"Terrible experience. It was my first visit. The wait times were entirely too long for dine in. Tables were not being bussed to seat new guests. After 20 minites, we were seated. We immediately gave our server both our drink and food order when she finally came. Then we waited. We talked, caught up with one another, and were really in no rush that Saturday night. But 30 more minutes passed before getting drinks. We told the manager. We were just ready to leave. She said our food was free but I was tired of waiting. I filed an online complaint and received a call from a regional manager. He asked if I would revisit that location.

There are definitely issues with the bar area. We sat at a table in the bar area and waited 25 minutes to put our drink orders in. My friend had to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager to let him know we had been sitting for over 20 minutes with no service. Then the waitress came over and did not immediately apologize. She looked annoyed that she had to wait on us. The food was alright (again not a fan). Then for the finale to this awful experience, she charged our tickets wrong when the tickets were clearly separated as to what tickets should be charged. Ugh!

31,Kiara S.,"Bowie, MD",1,9,,1.0,2013-03-22,"***Note: It makes me really sad to post such a negative review because this used to be a REALLY nice Applebee's. So nice that when my friends and I graduated high school back in '02, our families took us all out to dinner here. I also remember going here to celebrate getting my driver's liscense when I was 16 AND this is where I ate dinner on my first, official date.*** It took us almost three hours for a party of four on a Friday night to get food. Now keep in mind, the place was by NO MEANS packed. If they have 30 tables, I'd say 7 were filled with small parties like ours. The bar only had a hand full of people.  I don't feel they were understaffed because there were several waitresses hanging around the front laughing and saying mean things about some other server who apparently is a ""loser"" because she's in her late 20s, lives at home with her mom and can't drive a car.  Yes, real classy ladies...putting down a coworker right in front of the customers. I'm not saying you have to love everyone you work with, believe me I talk about people at work too, but I do it AWAY from our clients.  Anyhow, we had a very nice, though inattentive waitress. She seated us around 6:00 and came back almost 15 minutes later to take our DRINK order. After another 15 minutes she came back with our sodas and took our food orders. We each ordered simple stuff -- cheesestick appetizer and burger entree for hubby, chicken and rice for me, burger for my brother, and soup and a salad for my sister.  30 minutes later, the appetizer arrives and seeing us all sucking on ice cubes, the waitress days she'll bring back refills. After 10 minutes, my brother got tired of waiting, and finally flagged down another server and who bought us refills.  Another 40 minutes later and everyone's entree arrived except my sister. We all waited like 5 - 8 minutes and no sign of her soup and salad. We flagged down the hostess who apologized and said the kitchen was ""backed up"" (even though the people around us hadn't gotten their food either) and she'd bring out a salad.  10 more minutes and sis FINALLY gets her salad. It's supposed to be caesar but they've drowned it in so much salad dressing the leaves are kinda wilted and slimy. Sis is picking at her salad when our waitress arrives a minute later with another HUGE caesar salad that is just as gross.  15 more minutes go by and sister's onion soup FINALLY materializes. Everyone else is down eating, so we all order desert shooters so that we can at least kind of eat together.  Another 20 minutes later, the dessert shooters arrived. Everyone is in a foul mood by that time. The only redeeming factor is the waitress DID at least apologize and say that there was a problem in the kitchen...apparently the cooks weren't making food in the right order and they were backed up. (even though they had a full staff and a little bit of customers...hmm...)  After that experience, hubby has flat out refused to return. When we want burgers, we do McDonalds or Ruby Tuesdays.  *Note: I would not recommend this Applebee's for carryout either. After giving Applebee's a break between 2005 - 2011 due to poor dining experience and the fact the place kept smelling weird (like mildew and old cooking oil), I started getting the food to go since the 2 for $20 is such a great deal.  Hubby and I liked it at first.  The to-go service was decent...our food wasn't hot when we picked it up, but at least it was prepared within 20 minutes and almost always correct.  Nevermind the pressure to leave the person who takes your phone order a tip. (Until we complained to the manager, whoever took your phone order would always end the call with, ""That'll be $34.52 after tax and BEFORE tip."" And heaven help you if you didn't tip them...sucked teeth, rolled eyes, dirty looks..) Anyhow, something changed because the last three times hubby and I ordered and went to pick it up, the food wasn't ready and we had to wait another 10 - 20 minutes. Keep in mind they'll give us a time like, ""5:35"" so we wait and leave the house around 5:40, get there by 5:50 and we're told, ""Oh, your food ain't ready yet. They still cooking the chicken/hamburger/putting together the salad.""  So we'd stand in the little waiting area w/the other people waiting for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-largo-2?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

The food was great, it could have come out faster but it was ok. I would think being one of three customers in the restaurant you shouldnt have to wait long for food, but it was cooked to perfection so I didnt mind the wait. The chicken fajita roll up was delicious. Big and tasty, not lacking anything. The Bowie location served the roll up with pretty much just bread and it was cold. Our carry-out desserts were delicious too. I now prefer this location over the bowie location.

29,Alycia W.,"Washington, DC",70,51,23.0,1.0,2013-08-07,"If I could give this place no stars I would.  Last week my friend and I decided that we wanted to do happy hour at this location. I wasn't too thrilled when I first walked in. First thing, all the employees were huddled up towards the front discussing the latest episode of Love and Hip Hop. Strike one.   After being seated our server took  10 minutes to greet us. I mean the place was empty and one of the employees from the front could've at least taken our drink order. Once the server arrived. He was nice and friendly. So I felt a tad bit better. He took our drink orders and left us to talk. In the middle of our conversation. I saw a roach walk across our table. I immediately got up and moved to another table. Strike two.  I wanted to leave but my friend advised we should stay. She didn't want us to be the dramatic guest. So I let it be. I was still concerned but not as much.  I looked to the front were all the servers were hanging out but the clan disbursed. We let the server know and he told his manager. Once our food got there and we were seated at another table. Things simmered down. Towards the end of our meal my friend said ""don't freak out"". At first I wasn't sure what she was referring to until I looked down at the table. There was another roach! Strike Three  When our sever came back again we let him know of the second roach encounter.  he grabs a manager and she comes directly to us. Once we told her the problem she makes it seem as it was no big deal. ""There are no roaches in our kitchen, and they're usually brought in by guest...not saying that you brought them in but that's what happens"" Complete BS.

I was disgusted at how my table was treated. The service was terrible, the food was subpar, and the drinks were watered down. However that wasn't  even the worst part. After sending my drink back, the ""manager"" returned to my table with the SAME drink letting me  know that the bartender JUST made this drink--as if I would change my mind on how watered down it was. My friend received his drink and had the same problem and told our waitress, who proceeded to yell at us saying ""didn't I just ask you if you wanted to send it back when I was just here, I JUST ASKED YOU"". She says all of this while having very suggestive hand and body motions. I then spoke to the manager about the evening and explained to him that I will not be paying for this visit. Instead of asking me what was wrong he proceeded to storm off in a rage.  As I proceeded to leave the establishment I was confronted and told to pay my bill by our server, when I refused she told me that she would ""beat my ass"" YELLING across the restaurant at me calling me a ""broke bitch"". The situation then escalated when she charged at me and my group and called two of my friends  ""fucking faggots""--yelling ""get the fuck out of here faggot"". The entire time the ""manager"" is just standing in the room with his arms crossed SILENT, no intervening, no problem solving--silence.

We were waiting to be serviced for at least 20 minutes. We then let the host know and he let the bartender know. She was very busy at the bar but she did come over and take our drink orders. She was very nice. So we got our drinks and were then ready to order appetizers. The bartender came back to take our order. We noticed that there were a few employees sitting down including one of the managers. Another 30 minutes go by and we have not been assigned a waiter/waitress and we never received our food or drink order. At this point, everyone is fed up and ready to leave. Before we left, we asked to speak with the manager. The bartender called over to the ""manager"" who was sitting down eating. He slowly walked over to the bartender accusing her of not doing her job. He and the bartender started going back and forth. The manager refused to come to our table expecting the bartender to resolve the issue. Finally, everyone was fed up. With the manager standing there, we told the bartender to just forget it. We didn't feel like the service was worth paying for but the manager let us know that it would come out of her check. Those were the only words he spoke to us. He didn't chase us out to try to reason or anything. He just had the ""I don't give a fuck"" type of attitude. His name is Ron. He was so rude and nonchalant. I would never go there again.

Walked in there with my fiance and sat in the bar area. Waited 10 minutes for someone to come and wipe our table down. The server said she would be back with silverware. I then watched her disappear to the kitchen, come back out, and wipe down other tables. Thought that was strange.  After waiting an additional 10 minutes, we just decide to go sit at the bar. Wait at the bar for a couple minutes, then the bartender comes up to us and wipes down the bar area and walks away. Doesn't ask what we want to drink or if we want to look at menus. He goes to the kitchen too. We wait for him to come out, which he does, 10 minutes later, then goes back into the kitchen. At that point, we realized that we were stupid for thinking we'll get something to eat and drink at a restaurant. I could have applied for Applebee's franchise, interviewed staff, planned a grand opening, and get food from there in a shorter amount of time. Unacceptably poor service.

I used to frequent this place often until I noticed high turn over in the staff. The level of professionalism is slim to none under this new management! I went in for a drink, sat at the bar..the bartender never acknowledge I was sitting there for about 8 minutes. She was entertaining a group of her own friends that had come to her bar to get a hook up on drinks as one of the seemingly uneducated friends yelled loudly, as if that is ok for the bartendar to do. Once she did acknowledge me I told her I would rather just sit a one of the bar tables, she said ok hour server will be right over. I sat myself at one of the bar tables and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for a server to come take my order. Then she brought half my order and not my entire order when she came back. I ordered a lemonade and house margarita..she brought the margarita and not the lemonade. I waited another 15 minutes, she never comes back with the lemonade. I then go to the bar and ask the bartendar to see a manager. I go back to my table and watched the bartendar to see if she was going to get a manager or not. I waited another 10 minutes, still no manager. I then got up walked to then kitchen and yelled ""Is there a manager in this place or do y'all just run it like wild animals""?? Come to find out there was a group of individuals huddled up not far from the kitchen and one of them just happen to be the manager. Who by the way was within ear shot of the bartender. The bartender never told the manager I needed to see her! I explained my frustrations to the manager and she said well I don't know what to say. I said don't worry..u don't have to say anything, I'll just go to Outback which is 5 minutes away & proceeded to walk out. The manager Sharina Mitchell then proceeded to run behind me demanding I pay for the $4 margarita I ordered even though my entire experience was horrible and my order was wrong! She threatened to call the police over a $4 margarita that should have been comped to me because of the shotty service I was provided. I kindly threw Sharona $4 on the floor for her to pick up, just like trash! I will never go to this Applebee's again and I plan to start a petition tonhabe them closed down and replaced with a more upscale professional restaurant that offers good service and care about the quality of work their employees put out as a representation of their poor business practices!

12,Biohazard D.,"Capitol Heights, MD",28,38,246.0,1.0,2016-05-07,"Don't waste your time with this location.  After I got off from work on Friday, I didn't feel like cooking so I decided that we could eat out. Now normally we would hit up Friday's or Outback but this time, everyone else wanted to try something new so we went to the Applebee's in Largo. Now I'm thinking its Friday, so I'm expecting a wait but it was empty. That should have been the first sign. There is no way this place should have been empty at 740-8ish on a Friday.  We go in and get seated immediately. My son is immediately excited because of the games at the table so I'm pleased with that. We were sitting in a section where it was five other tables that were full. Two of those tables was full, one was waiting for a check and the other two were waiting for drinks and apps. Now there's only one server in this section.  I know she saw when the hostess sat is down because I looked her dead in her face when she came to get the check from the one guy who was leaving. It took her 20 whole mins from the time we sat down to even acknowledge that we were there!! So now I'm pissed and ready to walk out of there and my family is like no, let's eat here, maybe she's new.  Okay fine. So then she finally comes over and says oh I know your hungry so let's get started with the drink. There no hi no welcome no apology so I'm really really angry at this point. You have me waiting and you have the nerve to have an attitude now?? Oh yeah I'm definitely pissed. My boyfriend orders the meals because I don't want to talk cause he knows Ima fly off the handle.  I expect at least some type of customer service considering I'm about to give you my money. So she takes the drinks and the orders and goes to the next table. Fifteen mins pass before we even get the drinks. I'm so angry that even my son is saying this was a bad idea. The drinks come and they were good. The strawberry lemonade made me calm down a bit until the food came.  Low and behold, she got a real funky attitude now cause she just sats the plates down and walk off. Oh I'm ready to get the manager at this point cause this is down right piss poor service. My boyfriend is like calm down, we got the food so just eat so we can go and never come back. Okay fine. I agree and look down at my food.  He had literally like big chunks of roasted veggies like they just cut it in half and threw it on the plate. Imagine cutting a pepper in half and just putting one half on a plate. My steak was sooooo small that I literally could put the whole steak in my mouth. My son was content with his food tho. So I got the waitress attention after she kept side eyeing and dodging my table as walked by. I complained about the food and the lack of cheese and butter and dressing for my baked potato to which she never addressed after I complained about the food. I was immediately done so we just paid and left. And I did not leave her a tip.  I will never visit this establishment again. Poor service. Poor food.

We asked the server that delivered our drink ( she wasn't our server) and she had no idea. We pulled another server who was behind the bar and he let us know which drink was which. Our appetizer was boneless bbq wings. They were great. Served hot and in a timely manner. I order a 7oz steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. The steak was a weird color and wasn't cooked the way I asked. It tasted like rubber and was very chewy.  The mashed potatoes tasted like it had been heated and reheated and heated and reheated and then they added water. Yeah.

2,Faith P.,"Washington, DC",291,52,8.0,4.0,2017-08-10,"Ok, I see hit or miss reviews. So let's discuss this in categories.  For starters, I am a regular at this location due to the service of the bartender who goes by the name of Stephanie. Her specialty strawberry cocktail is definitely a seller at this place for the regulars. It has multiple liquors similar to a long island. She has me coming back to this place. She was very friendly and bubbly when I first met her. It has been a few times when I have came and Stephanie was not there and other people was behind the bar, my experience was OK. So let's talk about why this place can be hit or miss.  Service- Service is usually good depending on 'who you have' to be honest just like any place. Service here is usually nice. The manger Ron is usually walking around checking on guests. 8/10  Atmosphere- Usually a good 'home feeling' type of atmosphere. A bunch of TV's to watch if you ever come alone.  8.5/ 10 Cleanliness- 8/10. Bathroom can get a little unsanitary due to female customers being TRIFLING. But, I don't know apple bees cleaning schedule as far as how often these bathrooms get cleaned..lol. I always sit at the bar and the bar is usually clean. Stephanie and Mo' always wipe down the bar take away dirty dishes, drinks etc. 'Regulars' - Has their days when they can be rowdy. They sometimes have inappropriate conversations at the bar. But I'm used to it, they don't bother me and I don't bother them. They come for good drinks, BUT who wouldn't though? From the perspective of new comers being around the bar by the regulars can come off as a TURNOFF. I honestly, feel like if you cant handle inappropriate conversations at a bar where drinks are served maybe you should drink at home.  5/10 Servers- I don't really sit at the tables to eat but when I have, I was accommodated by Tona and Tijuan before. Both were great, very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  10/10 for these two servers.  Overall, Try it out.
