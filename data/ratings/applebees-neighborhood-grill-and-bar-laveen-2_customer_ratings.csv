89,Sophia C.,"Vista, CA",76,31,65.0,2.0,2012-01-25,"So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

74,Kyle B.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,26,6.0,1.0,2013-01-19,"Local residents in a small town 30 minutes south west of downtown Phoenix are ecstatic about the new changes that have been taking place at their local Applebee's in Laveen, Arizona. Super Official News stopped by the restaurant this weekend to investigate further what's making this hot spot so popular. Restaurant manager Paul Horner explained just a few of the exciting changes that have been happening. ""Every Friday and Saturday while we have our live Jimmy Buffet tribute band or gangster rap playing at full volume over the speakers from 3pm-2am, during breaks in the music, I've been letting my 8-year old son bang on his drum set that I just bought him for his birthday last month,"" Horner said. ""We also just got two new microwaves to cook all the food that is on the menu. We named them 'Chef 1 and 'Chef 2, Horner laughs. ""Preparing your steak how you want it will now be easier than ever! We also changed out the drainage system around the bar area so it doesn't smell like urine and human feces as much anymore."" Local resident Michael Spielman says he just loves the new changes at the Applebee's in Laveen. ""They repaved the parking lot and I even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building. Also, they have installed new air conditioning vents above every table that blow out the coldest air you've ever felt in your entire life. It's like traveling to Antarctica, but you're actually in Laveen! How cool is that, no pun intended,"" Spielman laughs. ""Also I noticed there is more free mints and toothpicks when I walk in. Rip-roaring good times have come to Laveen!"" Gerald Byrnes who has been a server since the restaurant opened two years ago gave us some inside information on the appetizers and beverages. ""No longer will our cold rubbery cheese sticks and alcoholic beverages that have no alcohol in them take an hour to arrive at your table. We have cut all our times down to 50 minutes or less or you get another alcoholic beverage with no alcohol in it free of charge! How awesome is that!"" Horner was more than happy to explain their new menus and additional usages. ""Instead of 7-9 different menus per person we are now giving each diner 19 different menus of various sizes and colors to browse through. It will all be the same food but now just more spread out to make things more fun,"" Horner said. ""Also to keep our customers safe, we are upgrading the menus to a type of plastic recently invented by NASA that has corners that can cut through glass. If the need ever comes up to fight off an attacker, our menus will work better than a machete."" Assistant manager Joyce Barth explained some of the other exciting new changes that have been made to improve the restaurant. ""Our greeters and servers will no longer speak urban slang and other forms of language that make it difficult to understand when trying to order food,"" Barth says. ""We have put each and every one of our employees through a rigorous 36-week course on how to properly speak to a customer in a language that can be understood by both the young and old."" Barth continued, ""When greeted at the front, no longer will you hear the familiar shouting of, 'Oh lawd, it's you folks again! Well git on in here and I'll get your seats right now! Not sure what's good right now for sitting, lemme check real quick for yall. You hang tight and chill, I be back after I git this figured out. I'll hit up my girlfriend Yolanda, she's one of the dish washers but she always has the down low on seats that aren't already taken up by some other fools'. This will now be replaced by, 'Hello and welcome to Applebee's. Would you like a table or a booth?'"" Horner told Super Official News that because of all these great new changes at his restaurant, unfortunately there will come sacrifices. ""In addition to raising prices on all of our food* because of Obamacare and firing employees so we don't have to provide them with health care, we will also be forced to raise prices to cover all the costs of these new and exciting changes. But I think everyone in Laveen will agree that it's worth it the next time they come in for lunch or dinner or just to get a drink with no alcohol in it."" From Applebee's in Laveen to your family: We know in Laveen you have no options for good food so when you're starving, and you have no food left in your house and the grocery stores are closed, head on over to Applebee's. We'll make sure you have the worst f*cking dining experience ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=60,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

Pleasant looking restaurant. Inside the air conditioning did catch our attention. 120 degrees outside contrasted sharply with near 70 degrees inside. Brr-rrr-rrrr . . . But that wasn't a negative. Didn't take long to get used to the frigid atmosphere. After a pleasant greeting we were seated and within minutes our server took drink orders. Lemonade and ice tea arrived right away. Received a new lemonade from our attentive waitress when my glass emptied.

Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp = Chicken tasted like salmon, shrimp was cold, and the mushrooms tasted like they skipped the cleaning process. We had 2 bites to eat and decided to ask for the check, waitress asked if we wanted boxes..... We quickly said no, she showed no concern to ask about if anything was wrong with our food, said okay and brought back the check. Put the check on the table and walked off, not a word. Came back and grabbed check with payment, not a word. Brought receipt for signature, not a word. Since she cared about our food and experience, I showed the same respect in her tip.

Service was just fine, with quick seating, friendly greeting and just the right amount of attention.  My wife ordered the Seasonal Berry and Spinach Salad and wine while I had the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and a Strawberry Lemonade.  The salad was fresh and light but they forgot the pecans. My wife always likes crunch with her salads, so that was a key missing piece for her.  My entree was tasty but needed help. The cheese sauce was so thin that it didn't cling to the pasta. Also the chicken was SO sweet that the flavor of the chicken (and pasta) got lost. The breadstick was a nice touch, as it was very similar to the mouth watering Olive Garden bread. Not a bad meal, just needed some tweaking to the recipe.

Which also weren't brought out at the same time. The food was bleh. Waited over an hour for a sandwich!  There was no silverware on the table so when we asked for silverware the server said the had no rolled silverware. She threw napkins & silverware on table.

52,April V.,"Phoenix, AZ",67,55,31.0,1.0,2015-02-06,"Typically I have have always had a mediocre experience at this Applebees. This time however was probably the worst I have experience so far. I do not expect much out of this location however anything worse then my typical experience is unacceptable.  Wait time: anytime I go it's usually between 5 and 6 so the wait time is usually always around 15 minutes. This time the wait time was the same but the greeter didn't even greet me with a Hello welcome to Applebees.  Instead I had to go up to her and ask her to put my name down. Waitress: After being seated we didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes.  This means we didn't even order our drinks yet. Finally when she made an appearance we gave her our drink order, ice tea and sprite. Took another 10 minutes.  Food: I get the same thing every time, steak and veggies. My 6 year old daughter got the 4 ounce steak from the kids menu. Medium rare for both of us. Took about 15 mins to get our food which was typical... but this time my steak looked like one of those processed steaks. Like the kind you buy in the bag at the grocery store precooked. It was done med well. My daughters 4 ounce steak, which looked like a small hockey puck,  was rarer than mine.  My steak tasted funny, I couldn't even finish it all. And it comes with seasonal veggies which happens to be broccoli,  ALL YEAR ROUND.  Half way through eating I was done with my ice tea awaiting a refill that never came. When we were done eating we waited for about another 15 mins for our waiting who I had not seen for at least 25 mins prior. I had to ask the buss boy to get her for me. My daughter really wanted desert and it was out date night so I agreed even though I just wanted to leave at this point. When our waitress finally came around I gave her the order we got the dessert soon after, and then we did some more for her to come back around so we could get the check. 10 minutes goes by again and she finally chose her face and asked if we want the check.  I did overhear her talking with the table behind us saying that she only started about a week ago, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to she was new. I still gave her a $5 tip on a 30 dollar bill only because of this reason. All in all I do not think I will go to this location again not so much because of the experience I had with the waitress but more on the food was less than mediocre this time and I couldn't even finish it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=40,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.604,1.92

But the commercials were intriguing. Had Applebee's really changed their menu to remain competitive with changing tastes & to compete with newer fast casual restaurants that aren't chains?  The answer is yes, but it's not impressive enough to turn the chain around. My date ordered a beer- IPA for him that was flat, and I got a glass of Cabernet (8oz for $6 and was decent) then we each had soup- French onion for me, chicken tortilla for him- and it came out piping hot and was delicious. By far best part of dinner. For our main course we both had steak- he got the 7oz sirloin with a baked potato and veggies, and I got the Shrimp & Parmesan sirloin. They came out warm, not hot. The cheese on the shrimp was a solid mess, not the melty kind indicated in menu picture. Garlic mashed potatoes were terrible- nothing garlic about them and also just warm with giant chunks of potatoes in them. My sirloin was actually good- soft and melted in my mouth. Not tough at all and cooked accurately according to the menu (pink all the way through, warm center). My date complained his steak was tough.  Service was just ok. We had to ask for silverware twice and wait to eat our main courses (maybe why it was warm?) until we got them. Server wasn't readily available, but we also didn't really need help that often.  If Applebee's wants to compete with other fast casual restaurants, they will need to represent their menu more accurately, work on faster food expediting, and evolve their wine and beer menu. Only 2 red wine choices? Most beers on tap were domestics- Bud, Coors, PBR, Miller Lite... Only one craft beer & it was flat.  Will we be back? I'm not sure.

During our dinner we asked three times if the music could be turned down a bit.  We realize it's the bar, but we were yelling at each other across the table due to the music volume!  Our waitress took our drink order, delivered outlet drinks quickly, took our food order, then never came back to our table.  An appetizer was delivered quickly by another server, then shortly two of our entrees were delivered by yet another server.  The third entree wasn't delivered and out waitress was no where to be found.  After another 10 or so minutes, I flagged a bartender down and asked to have the last meal checked on.  Finally our server showed at our table and explained that another server had taken the entree to another table.  She apologized and took another 8 to 10 minutes to bring out the meal.  Meanwhile the two of us were done eating.  You, as well as us were wondering why we were never checked on after the first meals were delivered.  None of us will return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=60,1.88,1.88,1.88,1.8280000000000003,1.88

Applebee's is not an in expensive place to eat. They're fairly pricey. And for that high price our silverware Service included a single fork each and a single thin paper napkin each. Really Applebee's? You can't give me a knife fork and spoon? And more than one see-through napkin? I did ask for a knife and he did bring one but he wanted to know for each of us individually... really? And nice of you to have a catchup bottle on the table too bad it was empty and we had to walk halfway across the restaurant to get another one.  The food was OK. The service was OK. But I think it's unacceptable to pay $14 for fish and chips and then not get a full set of silverware, more than one napkin and a catchup bottle with catchup actually in it.  And really...

Another thing is that I'm so disappointed with applebees come on be reason and respect your customers and at least pretend your worried about their safety. There was a drunk person at the bar harassing other people there all in their face and using racial slurs! When does the manager take charge and call authorities and remove this person? Oh wait they would have never don't that because they were too busy pouring the person drink after drink. I'm al for a good time but applebees needs to remember that there's crazy people in this world and a fight could have broken out or even worse. Very disappointed and never going back.

I usually wait about 3-5 minutes before someone comes out but I can see them acknowledging my existence and getting my food. This time I sat for 10 minutes and saw no one checking outside (it's dark and my headlights shine right in the door). The manager even came out the carside door as I was getting out of my car and kept walking to the back of the building. Alrighty. After asking the hostess if carside service was available she went to ask about my food. The manager came back with it. Yes. The same one who saw me get out of my car. He told me my total, walked away with my card and offered no apology or acknowledgement that anything was wrong. I left angrier at the whole place and thinking that maybe I just don't understand how carside service is supposed to work. And my husbands chicken was dry when I got it home.  It's not that I'm lazy. I'm not.

The bar tender sucks. She's not intuitive to all her customers. She defiantly has her regulars that she tends to more. But let's face it. Regulars around the ages of 21-25 don't tip well. She never asked me how my meal was but that one waiter has actually attended to me more by just walking around this u shape bar. I came in to eat dinner and drink a hot tatee cause I don't feel good and this is the service I receive. I'm an out of towner to. And get this she never carded me. I always get carded cause I look like I'm 20. Yeah so what I'm 30. I ALWAYS get carded. And this woman doesn't even know me. I even had to grab pepper off of another table. The no meat no chz salad that I ordered too was so ice cold. The plate was even ice. It hurt my teeth eating it. My mouth was frozen. I took only two bites and had brain freeze thereafter. After a long day of work to this. Sorry Applebee's get it together. Back home our Applebee's is the shit. This place has great servers but a damn horrible bartender.

The problem came when after 20 minutes or so another party of 6 comes in and they start complaining of wanting to be seated. The two greeters AND the manager  told them that my party was ahead of them and they would seat them in 20 minutes tops. After the other party kept complaining they got seated before my party. I then ask to speak to the same manager and ask him why this happened and I get told that he doesn't have an answer to that. By the time we got seated we had waited for over 40 minutes after the party that came after us got seated. Just a word of advice if you do decide to go here you should complain you will be seated a whole lot faster then if you are not a complainer like i was.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
