14,Bren T.,"Lawrence, KS",1,26,,2.0,2012-01-31,"Meh... My pasta dish was okay and parts weren't as warm as they could have been. My husband's baked potato came to him cold and as he was eating he said he didn't want to come back. Wasn't disgusting, but wasn't great. I kinda feel that way about Applebee's in general no matter the location, and that feeling was definitely refreshed today. Our waiter was great though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,

8,Katie G.,"Lawrence, KS",0,25,10.0,4.0,2014-03-04,"Pretty amazing! They changed their menu! Got the 2 for 25 deal and wasn't disappointed! We got the spinach artichoke dip, fried shrimp plate, and steak! Everything was excellent..only mix up was that we were charged extra for one item, but they took care of it right away:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
9,Michael O.,"Lawrence, KS",0,8,,1.0,2015-03-20,"Unsure of whether they want to be family-style, fast food, or some quasi sports bar. Food has really gone downhill in the past 5 years or so at this location. Service is poor - wrong orders, cold food, no attention to drink refills, etc. Kitchen seems to always be way behind and slower than tolerable. All you can eat wings special is simply a lie. First order is slow to arrive. 2nd or 3rd order always results in ""sorry the kitchen is really backed up. It'll be another 15 minutes or so."" Always. AVOID THIS PLACE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
6,Laurel C.,"Lawrence, KS",17,108,52.0,3.0,2015-05-02,It's alright food but not great.  Menu is always changing. They have unlimited wings or chicken fingers but you don't get unlimited fries. That's a dumb policy because if I ate more cheap fries I'd eat less chicken and you'd save money feeding me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
5,Loren B.,"Lawrence, KS",0,15,,2.0,2015-05-30,"I used to come here all the time as a kid. Once I hit junior high, my family gradually stopped just because. A while after the renovations, my mom and I went to Applebee's a few times before we stopped. We shared the appetizer sampler (it was plenty for us as a meal) but I consistently got stomachaches after getting home.  Things just look too greasy for me. I'm sure that's what it was. The chairs and tables feel sticky to me. The waiters were friendly, but the times my mom and I were there, our waiters would disappear. I recall that those nights weren't really all that busy. We asked for a box and it took at least 10 minutes for the waiter to return.  But, hey, it's Applebee's. It's the hit-and-miss of the chain restaurants in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
7,Judith C.,"Norwalk, IA",1,5,,1.0,2016-06-10,"I chose this Applebee's in Lawrence after a long trip, knowing I could get salmon for an early dinner.  So...an order arrived with odd texture, odd taste, hmmm. Finally got the waitress's attention who told me ""That's chicken.""  So after an apparent manager visit, I agreed to wait a promised seven minutes for salmon.  Finally got it, overcooked, charred dry on one end. I was also left with a cold baked potato.  At the very least I thought Applebee's might comp at least part of the meal for the poor experience.  Many restaurants would have done that.  No...full check plus undeserved 20% tip because of their electronic pay device.  It will be a long time before I return to an Applebee's even though there's one in Minneapolis that serves Walleye Pike - at least that's what I think it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
3,Lilly E.,"Bonner Springs, KS",4,17,2.0,4.0,2016-09-29,"My boyfriend and I go here every Thursday night for half price appetizers. Always good company. I love sitting at the bar and chatting with our favorite bartender! His name is Shawn. I usually get the broccoli and green beans (I love veggies) and my boyfriend usually gets boneless wings. Never disappoints us. Even though it;s a chain restaurant, I still recommend it for it's homey feel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
4,Kristy W.,"Basehor, KS",0,5,,1.0,2016-12-26,"I hope our experience today was just due to a bad day in the restaurant, but I'm not sure it could bc there was nothing positive about our visit.  Here's the list:  waited 20 minutes for drinks (never got one refill), waited over an hour for food, sent back the burger bc the bottom was charred (and was completely the wrong burger), 5 small pieces in an order of boneless wings, never got silverware.  Finally asked for boxes to shove uneaten meals into so we could bolt.  Server told us kitchen had flooded and he ""hoped we didn't need the restrooms"".  I will say that the three servers who were working the entire restaurant were working their tails off, we were offered a discount, but still paid more than the worth of our 'meal'.  A really bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
0,Tracy B.,"Lawrence, KS",304,208,257.0,4.0,2017-05-03,"You know, it really isn't bad.  I had not been to Applebee's in awhile and I wanted a cheeseburger. It was certainly a cheeseburger  kinda day. I wanted something fat and juicy with real gooey cheese. It was lunch and, per usual, I was in a hurry. I decided to do the app order so my food would be ready. The food was ready when I arrived and it was out-of-the-oven hot. The server was very nice and pleasant. He was shocked I tipped him when it was takeout, too. The burger was just as describe on the app. It was cooked exactly like I specified and it had goofy cheese. The fries were plentiful, too. There were lots and lots of fries. I am not much of a french fry connoisseur but they were plentiful and very good. The cheeseburger hit the spot and it was exceptionally yummy. There were some things missing that were on the app but I think that was my fault for not reading and ordering thoroughly. Bad on me. lol. My cheeseburger was still super yummy and I enjoyed every bite. Sometimes I think Applebee's does not get the credit they deserve. I have had some very good meals and experiences at this restaurant. I have typically had nice, pleasant servers and had no issues regarding service or food. Applebee's is a typical chain restaurant and you know what you are going to get well before you go there. The menu is always changing so there are new items to try and it never gets boring. However, i am still upset they took the fried chicken salad off their menu. It was amazing. The only reason I have it four stars is because of price. I thought almost $12 was steep for no-frills lunch time cheeseburger and fries. My meal was good but not $12 for a lunch good. Other than that, I recommend Applebee's for a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
2,Paige A.,"Andale, KS",0,10,,1.0,2017-11-15,"Let me start by saying, I know. I know Applebee's isn't a delicacy and I know it's my own fault for even walking through the doors. That being said, this particular establishment is a complete and utter shithole. First off, the entrance smells like a petting zoo. So that kind of sets the tone. We were sat quickly and waited on by a woman wearing a manager tag. We ordered drinks and wraps. When the wraps were delivered, they were dripping some sort of leakage that was REPULSIVE. But I can look past. EXCEPT the wrap was cold and tasteless. The fries were mediocre AT BEST but again, my b for even entering the premises. HERES WHERE I CANNOT: my fork was COVERED and I mean COVERED in food left over from the dude before me. Like, when you were rolling the silverware did it not cross your mind to INSPECT THE UTENSILS that people put into their mouths? I die. But I wasn't using my fork and try to be easy going so didn't say anything until my second refill was delivered in a cup that seriously had something that looked a lot like puke on the side. That was the last straw for me so I finally pointed the cup and the fork out to our waitress in a super polite manner. She launched into a sob story about her child and how she works at Applebee's one day a month and it wasn't her fault and so on. But her tag said manager so she was straight up lying to me as if I am a moron. She didn't offer to comp anything at all. It was so painfully awkward. Idk Applebee's.....................",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-4,,,,,
