4,Peter O.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",0,4,,3.0,2012-02-14,Got a hamburger and onion rings for lunch at the bar. It was cooked right and tasted good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
24,Arthur P.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",0,210,1.0,2.0,2012-05-31,"This is the one on Route 1 outside the Quakerbridge Mall.  I noticed there are 2 yelp postings for this location FYI.   Overall, its just ok..  Quality of service has definitely deteriorated over the next couple of years.  I feel sorry for them when Cheesecake Factory moves in next door in the mall.  Very, very disappointing happy hour.  Needs cheap early apps too on Saturday and Sunday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
1,Surya V.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,15,2.0,4.0,2012-06-07,"Went there for dinner after shopping at the Quakerbridge Mall. Since our kid wanted to eat there, we just entered around after 7pm. Didn't know what to try so we chose the 2 for $20 option. The service was good. The waiter suggested some food. Finally ended up eating the dinner and left happily. At least our kid was happy that he ate at a restaurant of his choice. He's been wanting to eat at this place since we started shopping at Quakerbridge Mall. Our overall experience was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5?start=20,,,,,
2,Daniel L.,"New York, NY",386,223,72.0,1.0,2012-07-09,"i don't know what to rate this place. 1 for food or 5 for people watching. the only satisfaction that you will get out of this place is knowing that you will always come out disappointed by their service. but if you desire to come here for the pure reason of people watching, this is THE place to go. you will never be disappointed with the different types of people you will meet!  for example, if you ever desire to make new friends with white noses, just excuse yourself to the bathroom, as you will hear them sniffing in the stalls. but in terms of food and service, your servers will forget the late night specials (seriously? it's the same stuff every night) along with your orders. then they'll rush the order. the food will be over fried or undercooked. pick your poison. service is so lackadaisical that i swear you could probably play a game counting how long you could dine and dash from this establishment. oh and yea, they'll ""accidentally"" charge you regular price for them. sleezy bums. this happens every time.. wish there were more places opened past midnight in the princeton area. but if you are feeling adventurous, then your ADVENTURE AND CRACK ADDICTION AWAITS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5?start=20,,,,,
23,Constance A.,"East Orange, NJ",153,374,462.0,2.0,2012-10-05,"What a bad experience my boyfriend and I had here in September. Flies, flies everywhere. My boyfriend and I sat on the restaurant side (opposite of the bar), near the window. There were so many flies flying around. My boyfriend made a comment that ""imagine what the kitchen is like"". We got the 2 for $20 deal (one appetizer, two entrees). The food was okay. No wow factor. They filled us up so that was good. We had a really nice waitress. I used to come here for half off appetizers during my undergrad years. But don't think I will be taking advantage of that anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
25,J H.,"Borough of Princeton, NJ",0,97,,3.0,2012-12-02,"I'm giving it average rating. Look, it is what it is. It's not Cheesecake Factory. In fact that's where we were headed, but too crowded. So I'm thinking Applebee's at Quakerbridge mall actually benefits from The Cake as a traffic driver. They shouldnt waste the chance to win new customers. If CF too crowded Applebee's gets the spillage. For us it was fine.  Seated in bar area. Lots of tvs. No wait. Ordered the chicken tacos appetizer. There are four of them. Not bad. Not a lot of chicken. But good enough. Steak fajita and chicken and shrimp fajita entrees. We both agreed. Too much seasoning for the steak and chicken. Totally unnecessary with a fajita style entree which has many flavors and textures. So not badly prepared, but a taste not to our liking. Observation not a judgement.  Service was good. Prompt. Friendly. No issues for us that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
21,Sarang K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",361,455,1311.0,3.0,2013-04-16,Applebee's is better during happy hour when the booze is cheap-a-licious and the appetizers are half-a-licious. So don't waste your time or money by going before 9pm!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
26,Kyle L.,"North Brunswick, NJ",27,11,1.0,3.0,2013-08-05,If you are in close enough proximity to an Applebee's and are just looking for a quick dinner to hold you over till breakfast time. Then I would suggest you grab a couple friends and get on down to Applebee's. However it is no place worth driving to for more than a 15 minute car ride. The atmosphere is fun and the food is fairly worth the mon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
0,Michele P.,"Kendall Park, NJ",0,8,,4.0,2014-06-27,"I had one of the best dinners in a while. food was awesome and the service was even better. We had a server named Kimberley B. Great personality, service with a smile. Truly loved what she was doing.  We never had to ask for anything. She was always there for our every need or want.  More places should have some one like this at their restaurants.  Thanks again Kimberly !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5?start=20,,,,,
3,Madhu K.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",0,5,,4.0,2014-06-27,"This is our favorite place to go for the whole family when we are craving some american food. I love their fries. One of the favorite for the whole family is the Triple Chocolate Melt dessert. Every time, we end the meal with this dessert.

17,Nikhil S.,"New Brunswick, NJ",2,25,5.0,1.0,2015-01-31,"Applebee's? More like Crapplebees I actually used to enjoy coming to Applebee's when I was a kid. The past 3 times I have been to this Applebee's the food was terrible. so bad I could not even eat it. Drinks are okay, but for a place that advertises as a restaurant - get it right.  I'll spend my money at the 10 other dining places that are minutes away",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
22,John L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",140,36,18.0,5.0,2015-03-08,The waitress was amazing just amazing orders were taken care of checked if we needed anything else and if our orders were to our satisfaction.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
19,Kim M.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",7,6,,1.0,2015-07-25,"AWFUL!!! My husband, two daughters, and I sat for 20 mins without a server coming!  The server kept walking past us, but it was if we were invisible. Needless to say, we left!!

12,Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",276,476,329.0,3.0,2015-12-03,"Stopped here for lunch, the place was empty even with all the lunch specials. Here's my breakdown:  Customer Service: Okay. The hostess was super friendly, the waiter probably could have used a little more training.  Food: Good. The lunch specials are great. You can order lunch here for $7.99, $8.99 or $9.99 according to your food combo. I went with the mac and cheese and club sandwich for $9.99. Both were delicious. I would suggest the mac and cheese to anyone, lunch special or not.  Restaurant: Could be better. The booths and tables were a little sticky. The window ledges were dirty with crumbs and who knows what else. The bathrooms were okay. The decor was typical for Applebees.  Parking: Confusing. I first entered the mall and tried to get to the Applebee's parking lot, didn't work. To enter the parking lot you have to come in off the main highway which is easy enough, just a little confusing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
18,Jenny P.,"Cookstown, NJ",1,5,,4.0,2016-07-05,"Came in, and was seated promptly.  They were not very busy maybe 5 or 6 other tables and a few at the bar.  The table appeared dirty but it wasn't it was scratches in the surface.  The waiter came over quickly and seemed in a rush but took my drink order.  I ordered my drink and continued to look at the menu.  When he came back I placed my order for spinach artichoke dip and the beer garden burger.  The dip came out piping hot and was delicious, I ate all of it.  My waiter took about 30 min past when I finished the app to check on the burger.  The order got mixed up and I got sweet potato fries but no burger and the waiter seemed confused and went to check on it.  The manager quickly came out and let me know what was going on and told me they were correcting the issue.  The sweet potato fries were really good and crispy.  Once I got my burger it took about 10 min it looked really good.  It was hot and fresh.  It came with a side of the beer cheese and the spicy pickles were amazing!  The burger was a great choice!  Cooked properly and very hot! Overall the visit took a little long but the food was really good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
15,Dee D.,"Freehold, NJ",6,5,,2.0,2016-07-16,"Went there Saturday evening around 6pm, wasn't that crowded but the guy serving me was so slow.  Been coming here for the last few years an only thing I can say is this place going down the hill from ok to worst.  They need to get their shit together before they close down this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
16,Gerard S.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",22,12,3.0,5.0,2016-08-02,Did the car pickup and I have to say I was greeted real warmly and the food was great. I've been to this location before and have to say I was very pleased.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
20,Mike C.,"Portland, ME",0,3,,2.0,2016-09-04,"We come here all the time and the service if you're sitting at the bar is a 4-5. But every time we are forced to get a table we are seated where there is no wait staff. This most recent visit was no different. After being juggled between the host and waitress who insists ""she isn't our waitress but will take our drink order,"" our waitress finally showed up to take our food order. My dish came out first and after one bite of chicken I could tell it was cold. Finally the rest of my party's food came out and the waitress told me they would ""re-make"" my dish. After over 5 minutes my food came out piping hot. She apologized and again insisted they ""re-made the dish."" The chicken had the same bite out of it I took earlier. So they clearly didn't remake it. They just re-microwaved it. My girlfriend's nephew ordered the dipping cheese which they always forget to bring out and he is forced to wait to eat his meal for 10 minutes until it was sloppily shuffled out to our table. After we paid the bill the waitress brought back change and then just removed her tip from the table before we even got up. Give your life an upgrade, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,

14,Oliver M.,"Princeton, NJ",132,19,4.0,3.0,2017-06-21,"Went the other night for some Applebee's with the boys, had a solid experience. We were able to bro-down over some 3 piece appetizer samplers for like $13-- what would seem like a deal. From there we moved to our entrees, a pulled pork taco plate and quesadilla burger, and waters all around for the fellas. Our server was super brotherly and the service was generally pretty rad. The food was dece, pretty standard casual dining fare. Serving sizes were satisfactory for two hungry dudes, and the playlist on the speaker system was super tubular, though kind of too loud. However the facilities were pretty dingy and the tables were sticky. Not rad. Stars for the service and the effort Applebee's is sort of putting into making the place appealing to millennial bros like us, no stars for the outdated decor and mediocre to okay food. Might be back to crack open some more cold ones with the fellas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrence-5,,,,,
