My experience wasn't horrible here. The service was fast but that is because not alot of people were there, and I am so not used to that. I felt like ""OMG what is this place"". I have never been to a apple bees so empty.  The server was new but she was very attentive and extremely friendly. She just didn't know much of the information. I always get my pasta without tomatoes and she said ""oh we can't do that' Umm what do you mean you can't women! I have been getting the same thing for 1 1/2 year nobody has ever said ""no we can't"" but I wasn't mad I just think she was new and didn't know much. needless to say I think everything was good, clean. Fast. Friendly! The chicken penne is amazing as always and the boneless buffalo wings (extra wet) so good.

Every single one we had to waive for a while a couple of times to get someone's attention. Not just our waitress... It's as if they are looking down while walking... The manager has to sharpen their people or else they will be left with no customers... We have been here plenty of times and same thing...

10,Zoe M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",9,10,11.0,1.0,2014-03-31,"I truly wish I could give this place NO stars. I went to this Applebee's only because it's the only thing open for me and my boyfriend to dine at due to our work schedules. Because of the bad service and food in past visits this place was on it's last life line in my book and completely FAILED ONCE AGAIN.... Our server Andrew was very friendly to begin with he greeted our table within 5 minutes of us sitting down. I ordered a perfect Petrone margarita and a water my boyfriend just wanted a water and boneless buffalo wings appetizer. When my boyfriend got his water I didn't nor did I get my margarita but we were ready to order. My boyfriend ordered the black and blue burger and I got salmon, mashed potatoes, and broccoli and threw in a side Caesar salad to come out first. As we sat and talked my Petrone margarita finally arrived but still no water or Buffalo wings. When Andrew finally came back to the table I reminded him about the wings another 15 minutes went by and finally they came out. When the food arrived almost an hour later my broccoli still was frozen. Yes frozen!!!! The salmon was not cooked the way I asked and I had a half a spoonful of mashed potatoes. My boyfriends burger was piping hot. After complaining Andrew  sent the manager over to my table, she then took my plate. Because of me working in restaurants I knew the salmon will take a while to cook so I ordered another margarita. My boyfriend asked for wing sauce and napkins to go along with his burger that he never received. When the manager finally arrived with my plate the broccoli unfortunately was still cold as if it was the first thing cooked and had to wait on my salmon. By the way my second margarita never arrived nor did my Caesar salad that should have came out before my food. I had to ask the manager for my margarita which I believe she made herself because the bartender was not behind the bar. Because of our complaints I can tell that Andrew was annoyed and did not stop back at our table because of it. When my food was finally delivered hot my boyfriends plate was empty. Everything was horrible!!!!! Not to mention the highly inappropriate music selection being played over the loudspeaker from somebody's personal phone or iPod. I will never go back I rather eat a quick trip hot dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is definitely something I did not want to go through after a long day of work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrenceville-4?start=20,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

29,Mercedes P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",9,136,333.0,3.0,2014-07-02,"Went out for a family dinner with my mother, sister, husband, and 2 children. Had chicken quesadilla and boneless wings for appetizer. Took a while for the boneless wings to come out and took another 10 minutes for the chicken quesadilla to come out. The server said they only had two cooks so things were coming out very slow. While waiting for our main course the waiter came out to confirm how we wanted our steaks cooked. Food came out about 15 minutes later, but they forgot mine. Not sure how they could forget it after coming out to double check the order. The manager was kind enough to discount the meal off and the waiter was awesome, as the wait time for our food was not her fault. She was very professional but the kitchen staff definitely needs improvement. I did get a house margarita that was delicious.

7,Concerned C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,7,2.0,1.0,2014-07-06,Worst service ever! My husband and I took our kids here on a Sunday for a nice dinner.  The waitress was clearly new which doesn't bother me ... I mean we all have to start from somewhere. My problem came when we were ready to go my son got sick to his stomach. The waitress proceeds to wipe up the throw up and place the rag ON THE TABLE next to my 2 year.

2,Jillian H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",6,153,16.0,1.0,2014-10-01,"Can someone PLEASE tell me why all the Applebee's in GA suck so bad??? This location is almost as bad as the Tucker one. Came here last night with my hubby, parents, and one of my friends for dinner. Got there around 10pm and were seated immediately. It all went downhill from there. Drink orders took at least 10 minutes. We all knew what we wanted, but when we questioned our server about the drink specials, she didn't seem to be knowledgeable about any of the specials, drink or food. Maybe she was new? Not sure. Anyway, ended up waiting for our drinks for another 10-15 minutes. With an empty restaurant, I can't see how it would take that long to pour a beer. We all ordered apps only, since we figured by that point apps would come out quicker than an actual meal. Wrong. Took just as long, if not longer. Food was good, except for the steak quesadilla towers. They came out flat and tasted like dog food. Pretzels were good though, as well as the mozzarella sticks. Everyone's order came out just fine, except for my friend. Her drink was wrong, and she never got the pretzels she ordered. When she brought it to the server's attention, she was told they had just run out. The server was nice and all, but poorly trained.

I just want my cheap 2 for $20 deal with two entrees and an appetizer to share with my friend while we catch up on life. At this particular Applebee's, I've never had trouble with service.

23,April T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",45,20,28.0,3.0,2015-09-27,Applebee's has never been a place of interest for me but I won a gift card from a game so I decided to give it a try. My daughter ordered the boneless buffalo wings and was satisfied with her order. I had the riblet basket with fries and I did not like it at all. I have had this years ago and it was nothing like I remembered it being.  The strawberry lemonade was a bit on the bootleg side. It was some type of opaque liquid with red syrup at the bottom. I guess that was suppose to be the strawberry to my lemonade. Either way I didn't taste any strawberry or any lemonade.  For dessert I ordered the brownie bite which was very cheap. I believe it was $1.49 and it was just enough for me. I'm not too big on chocolate so usually I just want a small taste of it. It was a small 3-4 spoonful of the brownie with hot fudge and walnuts on top paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The dessert was the highlight of my visit.  The customer service was good. I don't have any complaints on that. The restaurant appeared clean so no complaints on that.  Needless to say unless I have another free gift card I will not be seen at another Applebee's for quite some time so you gotta enjoy this review :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrenceville-4,,,,,
4,Tabby D.,"Pickens, SC",2,10,,2.0,2015-10-06,"The quality of food did not warrant the price. We were seated immediately because they were not busy, (it was 9:15pm) but it took a waitress over 5 minutes to come take our drink order. She informed us she was not our waitress, but she would be there soon. It took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to show up. She was very nice, but it seemed since there weren't many customers that was the time for the wait staff and bartender to sit at the bar and chat. We ordered our food and an appetizer since the waitress who took our drink order did not ask. Our appetizer showed up about 5 minutes before our meals. The food was decent, but seemed overpriced. The waitress sat a hot plate in front of my 16 month old daughter, but my husband's and my food was lukewarm. For $50 you would think not only the food, but the service would be at least good. Our waitress informed us there was only one cook, that several of the staff had left and a manager.

0,Meghann V.,"Mobile, AL",0,13,,1.0,2015-10-09,"Visited this location around 7:00 on a Sunday evening with my husband and our daughter. Service was ok. It was very hot inside, so we asked for the air conditioning to be turned on but never felt any cooler air. I rate this Applebee's one star because I am appalled at the food situation. The best looking thing on the table was our daughter's grilled cheese sandwich. Grilled cheese sandwich, as in, we should have just stayed home. My husband got the $10 overpriced chicken fingers. Seemed like a child size portion. Dry. Cold. Unappetizing. Waste of money. I got the fajita chicken wrap with a side salad instead of fries. My wrap arrived ten minutes before my salad, and upon picking up one half of the wrap, I found the entire bottom to be soaking wet. Probably tomato juice, so how long was it sitting before it arrived at my table? Then the wrap fell to pieces. I picked up a fork to try to make the best of it and found that there was no chicken. This wrap was cheese and lettuce. I don't remember ordering two salads....just pathetic. Ten minutes later I ate my salad and we left feeling empty, hot, and confused that this location receives any customers at all. I feel sorry for our server because she was very nice, and it seemed like the pathetic cook could care less what he was putting out and trying to pass off as dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lawrenceville-4?start=20,,,,,

Boyfriend has lived less than 5 minutes from this location for 6 months now but we have never gone because it never really appealed to either of us. Especially after reading some of the reviews for this location specifically. However, left with limited options for a late dinner on a Sunday night we figured we'd (tentatively) give it a try.  What a pleasant Surprise! We arrived around 10:50 and were greeted within a minute. Ended up ordering mozzarella sticks (half price after 10),Mac and Cheese with chicken tenders and the sirloin with stout sauce and potatoes (off of the $10  taste the change menu). Everything was superb and arrived in a timely manner. We waited less than 5 minutes for the cheese sticks and had just enough time to let them settle before our entrees arrived. Boyfriend's Perfect Patron Margarita tasted perfect (although it had an olive in the bottom?-- my only complaint but it didn't affect taste)   Our server Morietta was super on top of things and sweet!

When she did arrive, she explained that she was in the bathroom all that time.  Over the next hour, as we waited for our food and eat, she magically appeared two more times.  The burgers were great and the promo of $5.99 on Monday's is excellent.  If you do come here, make sure you have plenty of time, come hungry because the burger will fill you up, but make sure that Shaniqua is not your server. She has other more important things to do.

We all ordered drinks and food at the same time so that we would not have to wait forever. My sister sat the entire time without any food and she was the FIRST one to order and it was a F***ING 2-piece appetizer! We patiently waited and asked multiple times where the food was, reassured that they would be checking on it and get back to us and they STILL have not brought the food. We eventually had to ask for a manager. That is ridiculous, and unacceptable. Flat out unacceptable. We waited 15 mins to speak to the manager. Then, the waitress, Brittany, came over and was rude and yelling at one of the party saying that he got her in trouble and that she didn't appreciate that. She had to change the ticket because she didn't ask the party who had a particular plate and when it was added to the wrong ticket we asked that she remove it. It was completely uncalled for to be yelled at because of something we, the customers, have No control over. I don't know what makes people think they a) you can be that rude and b) that's disrespectful to the CUSTOMER. You do not come over to a customer and tell them that THEY ARE AT FAULT for the waitress not doing her job. This is the worst service I've ever experienced.

He says he will have it redone with the other 4 ounces.... u guessed it... he brings a cold piece of steak not on the skillet, no potatoes, no onions/mushrooms!!! Says the potatoes are frying, brings out some refried potatoes... ughhhh  My friend's ""all u can eat"" chicken fingers came out in limited amounts on small plates, IF U CAN'T HANDLE ALL U CAN EAT, don't offer it on your menu.
