12,D L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,58,,2.0,2013-02-11,"Terrible. The only thing good about this place was paying the check and leaving. Beer was stale. Food was unbelievably salty and overcooked (shrimp in my case, steak in my companion's case). I've had fast food more appetizing than this, and the service was not great.  I'm not sure what draws people to this place. It's not worth coming back to. Next time I'm going to Captain D's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
11,Terrance C.,"Lima, OH",58,5,3.0,1.0,2013-06-15,Sad to say that Applebee's was my favorite place to eat growing up in cincinnati but the two here in lima are not what the franchise had in mind when opening in lima. One makes me sick and the other has the worst service I have ever seen from both the front and the back of the house. Will never eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
7,Joseph L.,"Lima, OH",13,64,42.0,5.0,2013-07-25,Clean restaurant. Great service. food was good. They remodeled the restaurant and it looks great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
10,k b.,"Lima, OH",2,5,1.0,1.0,2013-11-12,"I try to avoid chain restaurants as much as possible, but living in Lima, its hard to do.  On Veteran's Day, some places offer a free meal to vets. My boyfriend and I thought we'd give Applebees a shot, but knew to have no expectations. It was beyond horrible.  He ordered shrimp. The waiter came back 5 minutes later to say they were out.  His next choice was a steak, medium rare. The steak came out gray, not seared, pink all the way through, and just looked awful. The baked potato looked like it had been microwaved and topped with about a cup of sour cream.  I ordered the cowboy burger. This probably would've been alright if the bottom bum was not completely soggy, and the burger had more than a couple drops of bbq sauce. The lettuce on the burger was approximately 2 inches in diameter, and completely white. Anyone who's ever worked in a kitchen should know you don't serve that shit. Lettuce is not white.    Even the mountain dew was horrible. Watered down, I'm not sure, just all wrong.  The ONE good thing, was our appetizer. We got the potato twisters, because I figured it was foolproof. You can't possibly mess up slicing a potato and frying it. These were good, though overpriced.   Applebees. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
2,Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",183,1934,1243.0,3.0,2014-05-11,"Stopped in after seeing a concert given by Sweetie's friend.  Took him here for a snack afterward, because it was handy. Apparently it's a top spot in Lima, because it looked packed from the outside.  Inside, there were a few tables, and things moved quickly.  Service was excellent.  The food, well, it was okay.  We shared an appetizer sampler, and our friend had some kind of southwestern chicken.  He loved it.  The apps- wings, cheese sticks, quesadillas, chips with artichoke dip- were okay.  The chips were very salty, the dip was great, and the cheese sticks and wings were just okay.   The quesadillas were pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
8,S. G.,"Lima, OH",0,37,4.0,1.0,2014-09-12,"I have given this restaurant three chances, I am sad to say nothing changes, the service is very poor and the food is jus not good. We called corporate to let them know after the first experience, nothing happened, not a call, not a letter, we assumed they just do not care. A few month later, we tried again, same problem with service (slow, non attentive, like we are a bother because we came in, doesn't listen), ordered food and it was not cooked right or the wrong order in general. Believe me, this is one restaurant you want to skip, you will be happy you did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
4,Charles Q.,"Warrensburg, MO",111,18,12.0,2.0,2015-07-23,"Probably the worst spot to get a quick bite. I sat at the bar wanting to order food and saw all 3 servers walk away or the opposite direction.  ""Maybe they're busy"" BUT THERES NO ONE HERE EATING! So we got some lazy servers I get that but 3 of them doing nothing? Come the freak on...get them on customer service class because that's how you get bad reports.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
5,Torque R.,"Lima, OH",1,33,,5.0,2015-12-01,"Applebee's was voted as an official 2015 ""Loved by UNOH Students"" restaurant! Congrats, you've earned the UNOH students' seal of approval!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
6,David B.,"Lima, OH",0,26,9.0,1.0,2016-03-06,"I would give it 0 stars of I could.  We ordered two sirloins and both were dry, undercooked and full of gristle.  They didn't even offer to take anything of our bill.   This was their last chance, we will not be back. The one on other side of town not bad, but this location SUCKS!!!!! Poor food and management",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
3,Mark B.,"Lima, OH",0,6,,2.0,2016-04-10,"Came in with family at 430pm.  80 percent seats open.  They stick a 55 yo man on a high chair seat...literally had to climb up and on my chair.  Steak nachos lacked flavor, after a few minutes soggy... food quality fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
0,Cathy C.,"Wapakoneta, OH",3,156,,3.0,2017-11-15,"Stopped in for a late lunch after a movie during the week.  Seated quickly at large booth, which I had requested - cold out, don't want to be against the windows with 3 of us at a table. Food was good for all 3 of us.  The house side salad was very nice (much nicer than most side salads) and the Caesar salad was good and not swimming in dressing. Had the ribs, chicken with mushroom and one had chicken tender - everyone was satisfied with food. Service could have been better.  Didn't bother asking about refilling our drinks only ask about if my husband wanted another beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
1,Sam S.,"Saint Marys, OH",1,5,,2.0,2017-11-24,Went there yesterday while shopping. The bartender was great. Waited and hour for our food with probably three other tables filled. Then one of the waitresses started screaming and crying then stormed out. Ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-5,,,,,
