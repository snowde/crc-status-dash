14,Tania H.,"Austin, TX",55,246,403.0,3.0,2013-03-23,"There is nothing spectacular about this place. It's the same old Applebee's fare.  The greatest convenience is that it was literally in the parking lot of my hotel between the Courtyard and the Hampton in. Food was decent, place was very busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
8,Brian F.,"Hilliard, OH",329,285,11.0,2.0,2013-05-14,"I've been to this place twice now, both times on Mother's Day when nearby restaurants were too crowded.  It's not terrible at all, but we did have a few gripes.  First off, the booth we were put in looks pretty terrible.  There are several big holes in the upholstery.  The service was pretty slow as well although it was a bit crowded and got progressively moreso as the afternoon went on.   As for the food, I had the chicken penne dish, and it was fine.  We ordered some apps, and we all agreed the Pretzel breadsticks and beer cheese dip was very good.  Green bean crispers and Spinach Artichoke dip were good as well.  (yeah, we got three appetizers...don't judge) Beer selection isn't great, but it's adequate.  I selected the Sam Adams Summer Ale, which was tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
17,Parker M.,"Walton, KY",17,16,19.0,3.0,2013-08-13,"The same, regular Applebee's. Good service, okay food. I always love the pretzel sticks and green bean fries, delicious appetizers. Whenever I come here now I will order the American BLT, and that's good. I just wish I could find some other stuff on the menu desirable n",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
16,Joseph L.,"Lima, OH",13,64,42.0,5.0,2013-08-28,I frequent this restaurant a lot. I cant say that I have EVER had a bad dinner. Food is always good. The service is always great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
12,Richard L.,"Grand Ledge, MI",3,3,3.0,1.0,2015-01-31,"Stopped in at 4 pm on Saturday. Waited 7 minutes but no one ever came up front to seat our party. While we were waiting another couple was leaving. The waitress followed them apologizing for something, got almost to us but turned around without seating us. Our party ended up leaving and went to Lock sixteen which was probably a better choice anyway.  Can't recommend this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
10,Jacki B.,"Westerville, OH",0,9,6.0,4.0,2015-04-27,"My husband loves coming here. They did get rid of his favorite ""Crispy orange chicken over rice"".  It's okay for me, nothing special.  Better than fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
11,Kevin L.,"San Diego, CA",60,5,1.0,1.0,2015-07-16,Very poor service in general. I know a party of 20 is very hard to serve for but waiting over an hour for appetizers when people come in over half an hour after our party was seated is unacceptable. Especially when you have 2 children under the age of 4 waiting for food for over an hour is simply ridiculous.  I do not recommend this establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
15,Mike S.,"Valley, NE",0,4,2.0,4.0,2015-11-07,Great new menu.   Really impressed on their attempt on rebranding.  Fast and affordable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,

4,Carroll H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,51,227.0,2.0,2016-04-26,"Our home AppleBees has it kickin over this one. Tortilla soup was all onions and mushy tortillas and found two tiny slivers of chicken, ours at home has crisp tortillas, gorgeous CHUNKS OF TOMATOES AND AVOCADOS, none here to compare. The Chicken Quesadillias was so sad it was funny and what is with all the red onions. I took pictures, tiny slivers if chicken maybe two or three slivers in each slice so LIMA APPLE BEEs you need some vamping in the kitchen, cause We are regulars at home in CO and they have it going on there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
5,Andrew G.,"Dayton, OH",2,35,14.0,1.0,2016-05-09,"I've been to this location several times, as there is a Tesla Supercharger just behind it.  We usually only get a soda and the avocado and chips, as that's all we trust at this place.  However, last night we ordered a side salad without bacon, and a bowl of Southwest Steak and Black Bean Soup (see pictures).   To start with, the host was very nice.  He put us in a booth, and brought us water.  The server did not arrive, so after 10 minutes, we ordered via the little iPad like device on the table.  After 15 minutes, the host came by to explain that our server was very busy.  We told him it was no problem, as we had ordered using the table device.  We asked that he make sure that bacon was not on the salad.   After a while, the salad and soup showed up.  Of course, the salad had bacon on it.  My wife just picked it off the salad.  The soup did not look anything like the picture, including it was in a very small cup, and I could only find one piece of ""steak"" and three black beans at the bottom.  I asked the host, who said ""oh, they gave you the tortilla soup"". (see picture)  He was very nice, and took it back to the kitchen.  After several minutes, a bowl of the same stuff showed up.  Our server finally showed up to see if we wanted to order anything else.  I showed her the picture of the Southwest Steak and Black Bean Soup, stating that it looks nothing like the picture.  She said the same thing, that it was the chicken tortilla soup, without the chicken or tortillas.  I then asked for the manager.  When I asked the manager the same thing, she said that it was, indeed, the Southwest Steak and Black Bean Soup, and that it does not look like the picture.  She said she prepared it herself.  It was obvious to me that she put one piece of steak and two black beans in the tortilla soup.  The two servers had confirmed this.  The manager was caught substituting something and did not want to be caught in the lie.    In addition, the place is always filthy (see picture).  We have been here about four times, typically at night, and it doesn't look like any food that drops on the carpet is ever removed.  The bathrooms should be condemned as well.  There are plenty of better places to eat in the area.  Avoid this place at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
6,Joshua G.,"Delphos, OH",0,3,,2.0,2016-05-15,"The service and atmosphere is the only reason for a second star. The food selection is limited and very overpriced. The prices are for an upscale restaurant but this is a ""neighborhood grill"". The food seems rather cold and stale when they bring it out. I went here with my wife and she found an onion skin in her mashed potatoes. The manager was happy to provide us a free meal for the bad experience without us even complaining.  Bottom line is the service is awesome, but the food and pricing is less than ideal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
9,Kelly R.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,13,3.0,1.0,2016-05-15,"I have never had such terrible service from both the server and the shift manager.

2,Ken O.,"Chatham, IL",0,25,4.0,1.0,2016-06-24,Horrible service and this place is dirty and the seats are very uncomfortable. Waited way too long for appetizers and it was cold chicken.

My food was good and the order (special order, of course) was dead on. I just can't bring myself to give an Applebee's, ANY Applebee's that coveted 5th star!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
1,John H.,"Carmel, IN",0,6,6.0,1.0,2017-08-27,"We have been to many Applebee's around the country. This is by far the worst. Food just laying on the floor while a host instead of cleaning it up has just been standing around. Waited 5 minutes for some one to seat us. Then 10 for sometime show up and take order. Would have gone some place else but our car is charging next door. Spoke to the manager and she could not car less! Poor service , poor management. Now we finally got order my green beans were cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lima-6,,,,,
