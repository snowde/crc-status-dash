5,Echo D.,"Lincoln, NE",36,119,174.0,1.0,2015-01-01,They need better training for waitress. I got my soup without spoon and took 5mins to get the spoon. I had a cold soup. When we finished appetizers the waitress  brought us check to pay. She didnot serve our entree yet WTF. She totally forgot to serve our foods and Never asked refill drinks.  WTH. I hate going to franchise restaurant  but no choice for new year day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
6,Jeffrey D.,"Lincoln, NE",114,527,24.0,2.0,2015-01-26,"Maybe we caught them on an off day but I have a feeling there is more to it than that.  It was very busy and there were many groups hanging out watching the game.  That should be situation normal though here in Nebraska.  As we are not demanding customers we are very easy to please.  We had trouble getting utensils and refills for our water.  The food came out late and some entrees were completely forgotten.  We reminded the waitress and she came back a few minutes later with my meal.  The food was ok, but we are pretty sure we aren't going to head back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
7,Jeremy S.,"Walton, NE",7,4,,1.0,2015-02-28,I have food allergies so when I placed my order I gave explicit directions for preparation which were ignored. I asked for no butter on anything and ended up with buttered vegetables draped over everything on my plate. With my dairy allergy I couldn't eat anything on the plate. But wait there's more: similar instructions for my wife's entree were ignored as well. Will not be eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
8,Greg S.,"Salina, KS",0,5,,1.0,2015-02-28,"Horrible, lied about the size and cost of appetizer, over salted food, and manager just walks around not interacting with any of the customers. Lesson learned: tell your pregnant wife when she gets a craving for Applebee's hell no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
4,Brandon J.,"Lincoln, NE",0,6,3.0,2.0,2016-04-30,Very disappointed 27th the 2 for 25 meal the steak was tiny and the mashed potatos were watery the manager was very nice and gave up a refund but we still waited over 25min before I even saw my waiter,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
3,Michael C.,"Lincoln, NE",0,3,,1.0,2017-02-05,"Decided to grab a quick bite for myself and my pregnant wife with some carside to go. I ordered the Southwestern Steak salad, it sounded delicious. My wife wanted honey bbq boneless wings. We sat at the carside 5 minutes longer than they said they would be ready, after which someone I presume was the manager came out and told us it would be a little longer. No problem. Paid, went home to eat. My wife's boneless wings were spot on, delicious...thank heaven. My salad, however, was on the other side of the spectrum. Giant to go bowl, MAYBE a third full, of salad mix you could probably buy at a store for $1. It looked pathetic. The southwestern part? Maybe 5 to 10 pieces of corn or beans tossed into the bottom recesses of this large bowl. To top it off, a tough, tiny steak not even cut all the way through. The taste to the steak was nice, but I didn't expect it to be cold as well. I paid almost $12 for this salad that I wouldn't normally pay $4 for. It was side salad size. I truly hope they take some time preparing salads in the restaurant, because I would refuse to pay for it inside, and would be speaking to a manager. I am not a picky eater, and I am a nice person, which is why I am pleading with any customers that come here, to skip the anger and anguish of this. If you want a salad to go, DON'T ORDER IT HERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
2,Tori O.,"Omaha, NE",41,15,3.0,3.0,2017-02-23,"I used to go to Applebee's all of the time but in the past couple years they have completely changed their menu and stopped serving some of my favorites. They have also raised their prices a lot. The service was pretty good, except getting a drink from the bar took awhile. Sweet potato fries are always my go to. The Thai shrimp salad is sometimes delicious and sometimes subpar so you never know what to expect when you order it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
1,Herman Z.,"Lincoln, NE",0,27,,2.0,2017-08-08,"This used to be a good spot to go, however, it's in decline. Food is still pretty good for the most part, it's the service or lack of, that's the issue.  I shouldn't have to go to the bar to get my drink refilled. I also shouldn't have to steal napkins and silverware from other tables, but yet I did since my server wasn't in a real big rush to get me some. Her excuse was that she was needed in the kitchen. I might have bought that had I not seen her standing by the bar talking to the bartender as I went to get my drink refilled.  I know Applebee's sales have been sliding the past few years....it's not difficult to see why. But, if you enjoy slow to non-existent service, then this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-11,,,,,
