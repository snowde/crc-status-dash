8,Al G.,"Belmont, MA",8,65,42.0,3.0,2012-11-24,"If you don't know the area that well, it's the only thing that's open that looks half-decent.  Since I'm solo, I usually eat in the bar area.  It was clean and the staff was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002
24,Paul Z.,"Lindenhurst, NY",89,14,86.0,3.0,2014-03-23,"Decent place as long as you don't come too late when all the obnoxious kids come out for half priced apps. The biggest complaint i have is regarding the increasing prices of the apps, likely due to the popularity of the half priced apps.  Also, all the huge pictures of local sport teams on the walls is a bit tacky. I dont want some big sweaty football player watching me eat my burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
5,Andrea F.,"Massapequa, NY",13,7,,5.0,2014-05-30,"Came here for lunch to celebrate a coworkers birthday.  I had the lunch special with a half turkey sandwich and half strawberry and avocado salad.  I am trying to limit my calorie intake and this selection was under 600 calories. It was very good and filled me up.  I would order this for lunch again.  Didn't realize Applebee's had such tasty healthy selections.  Our server was very attentive, split our checks for us and even the manager came by to check on us.  It was an overall great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005
23,Sarah W.,"Olympia, WA",0,29,5.0,5.0,2014-07-27,"Came here with a bunch of family members about 13 people on a Wednesday (I think).  The place was packed full at midnight and we had to wait a little longer than usual but it was definitely worth the wait.  I really enjoyed all the decorations on the walls and the big TV's that were above our booth on the ceiling.  I got a chicken tenders basket and Orlando chicken salad. The salad was the best, even for someone like me who hates my veggies!  Overall we had a fullfilling night and we'll come back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004
27,Jay P.,"Amityville, NY",0,35,,1.0,2014-08-29,"My 1 star review is for the entire Applebee's franchise. Their food taste bad & I would rather spend my money somewhere else. As for the people that say bad location, I don't get it. Seems like every other location on sunrise highway.  I ate here once and ordered the 3 cheese pasta. It was nasty I only had two bites. Then had takeout once and ordered  a blue cheese burger. It too was nasty. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,
4,Marie M.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,3,,5.0,2014-12-04,"I go to this applebees often with friends and family, We love going during football season to watch the games on the many tv screens they have on the walls.  The wait  to get a table is never too long even if it is busy. They always have great service and friendly waittresses/waiters and bartenders. They sometimes have loud and obnoxious people drinking at the bar but overall a great place to have some drinks with friends and also a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,,,,,
6,Kat R.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,7,,4.0,2015-04-17,"Brought my mother and my son here for a celebration dinner around 5:00pm on Tuesday. We were seated right away, as it was early-ish.  Had a wonderful time, our waiter was VERY Attentive. Our food was hot, yummy, and exactly as we ordered it.  The manager stopped by to see if all was well, and we made sure to tell her what a great job our waiter was doing and what a great time we were having.  All in all, a nice place to eat with great staff and great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,,,,,
26,Customer S.,"Port Jefferson, NY",0,12,,5.0,2015-06-05,"Good food, great prices! The service was gooood. Had the 2 for $20, although some items are a little bit salty, its not terrible.

2,Maria C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",33,64,6.0,4.0,2015-06-07,"Come here for happy hour on Fridays and it's a pretty nice bar to unwind in after a long work week and commute before starting the weekend. Good parking, usually a Mets game on ESPN, which helps make this spot enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,,,,,
28,Tom C.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,9,,1.0,2015-07-04,"I know Applebee's so I set the bar low and I would never review a chain restaurant, but my experience/food was horrible. I got the triple hog dare you sandwich that was supposed to have ham bacon and pulled pork and French fried onions. I got a ham and cheese sandwich with a huge heap of great nasty soggy fried onions with less than 1 ounce of pulled pork. I had to flag down a server to get a manager because my waiter disappeared. The manager took my plate away and didn't return until 20 mins later. Everyone else was done eating. I felt like a dick eating my crappy sandwich ........ Yes even done properly the sandwich still sucked. Usually when food goes out of the kitchen that messed up the manager will offer you free drinks or dessert we were offered nothing not even an apology. I will never go to this or any other Applebee's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,
22,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,303,767.0,3.0,2015-07-27,"Came here for late night munchies with my boyfriend. We decided to get a bunch of appetizers.

25,Armando V.,"Tampa, FL",865,19,1.0,1.0,2015-09-27,"Couldn't even get through the greeting. No hostess or sign to wait or seat self. We sat ourselves by a bar side table. Moments later a server brought us menus and told us that we weren't supposed to seat ourselves. We apologized. He made a point to say it again. Apologized again. He didn't let up. We let it go, but he didn't. We could hear him 30ft away whining to the manager about it. Needless to say, we didn't take another chance on his attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,
3,Matthew S.,"West Babylon, NY",42,6,2.0,2.0,2015-10-29,"if you like fast food franchise operations then this would be good for you. Ordered three cheese penne with grilled chicken- the ends of the grilled chicken was grey, the penne was short of warm, so i wrapped it up for my dog to eat. The mozz sticks are always good here but thats easy because they come frozen and they just deep fry it. Wont go back again, at least i tried.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst?start=20,,,,,
15,Christina J.,"West Babylon, NY",330,332,2139.0,4.0,2015-11-27,"It's an Applebees, so I'm only comparing to other places such as this. I love their half price appetizers. You get an ample amount for a small price.  With that being said I didn't get appetizers on this last visit. I got a burger that was cooked perfectly and had brisket & jalapeños on it. Very delicious. My son got the steak with Parmesan shrimp on top. He was very happy. The steak was cooked medium rare like he asked & the shrimp was hot cheesy & melty.  The drinks were 2 for 1 and tasted good. And the churros were delicious by themselves especially. I say that because we thought the chocolate sauce was too sweet. But don't go by us, we're not big chocolate fans. The waiter was friendly & on point. I had no problems here with the food or the service. Would definitely go back & recommend to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,

19,Bj S.,"North Babylon, NY",0,4,,5.0,2016-06-23,"I came here with a group of friends for half off appetizers. Our server Courtney was very attentive and welcoming ! She was able to carry 3 pint glasses in one hand which was extremely impressive. Despite it being busy she still gave great service and was on top of drink refills. Our appetizers came quickly, we had the boneless wings and sweet potato fries which were excellent! The triple chocolate meltdown is to die for! I'm a regular at Applebee's for half apps it's a great deal and the service is excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,
14,Juhi G.,"West Babylon, NY",121,124,283.0,3.0,2016-07-29,"Went here for half of apps and it's usually pretty good but this time it was just mediocre. This review is mostly about the waiter because I think every customer should be treated equally but since we only went for half off apps she goes ""oh it's just apps and we get so busy so you get what you get"" like what....I'm paying for this food....not to get what I get. That comment had my friends and I like ""uhmmm what?""  also the wings were so dry they had like no sauce.

I was just happy i didn't throw up at the table. The kid next to me of course had to have some loud ass obnoxious cartoon shit on his dumb phone and was playing it at level 11. How fucking rude. Shut that shit off or buy the little troll some earphones. Jeez,,,anyway nothing really looked good to me at all. They changed the menu for the 100x and some stuff i liked is 86'd. I got chicken wontons, chicken ques and chips and salsa. My sis got Honey BBQ wings. Wontons were good, ques were meh and chips and salsa were um chips and salsa. The fucking wings only came in drumsticks no flats and i hate that part so i didn't have any. We really needed to leave cause i was super nauseous but waiter was MIA.

Service was terrible, waitress never came to refill my water and my entree came with a hair in it ( I get that this happens sometimes) but come on.... The manager was nice enough to comp the dish but never came back to make sure the second order was okay . If I do return, which is doubtful I will ask for Willie -he by far is the best waiter there .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,,,,,

11,Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",71,90,160.0,5.0,2017-05-27,"Always my go to late night spot. Half off apps are something you can't ignore at 10 pm when you are craving drinks and fried food.

16,Kristin C.,"West Babylon, NY",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-08-11,"I've always loved Applebees and never really had a problem before and if I did it was handled well. Tonight was a different experience. I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry and it was so spicy I couldn't eat it. I told the waitress and she asked if I wanted something else but the spiciness made me feel ill, it was like the back of the house kept peppering it. She took my food. A bit later the manager stopped by and asked how things were and I told him about my food, he too offered me something else and I told him too that the intense spiciness made me feel sick. They didn't take it off the bill, didn't offer me a comp meal next time I visit, nothing. Waitress didn't even come back and see if we wanted dessert or bring me another refill on my sofa. Very disappointed in how this was handled!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lindenhurst,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
