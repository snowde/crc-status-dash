14,Don M.,"Leesburg, VA",41,32,,1.0,2013-06-03,Crapplebee's is a sub-par food factory.  This location had a hard time even microwaving the food they served to me.  Ouch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
15,Tom H.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,98,1.0,3.0,2014-01-08,Hey it's an Applebee's   It is the same as all the others although it is cleaner than most. Staff is good. Food is what it is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
13,Larry L.,"Baldwinsville, NY",10,3,,5.0,2014-07-14,We were quickly seated the waitress was very quick to our table for our drink orders food was hot and cooked just right.  Krista was our waitress and she did a great job,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
7,Beverly C.,"Troncone-mancino, Italy",27,98,1174.0,3.0,2015-03-18,"I had some of the new menu items and whoever developed these, deserve a pat on the back. The grilled chicken wonton tacos and the salsa verde shredded brisket nachos were really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
5,Christian M.,"Overland Park, KS",13,66,22.0,2.0,2015-10-08,"My wife had the Texas burger and I had the brunch burger. My burger had an egg on top which I do like, however I don't expect an egg that's over hard with no yoke. To me that's the purpose of putting the egg on top so the yoke is like another sauce for the burger. Flavor was ok. I tried my wife's burger and hers had brisket on top, which I was amazed they were able to call brisket. It looked like some sort of gravy or something. I guess expectations from the new commercials were a little higher than what we got. Probably won't order this again. Just wasn't that great of a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
10,Nick M.,"Liverpool, NY",70,4,,5.0,2015-10-26,The food sucked the drinks were awful and tasted like donkey piss but mr Anthony Russo came in clutch and made our visit very nice and quaint with preferred window seating and opening our car doors for us,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
3,Kirk R.,"Syracuse, NY",44,151,79.0,2.0,2015-12-08,"Meh. On a recent visit, I had an ""All American (cheese) Burger"" with mashed potatoes.  The burger LOOKED like a yummy meaty masterpiece, but upon eating, I was disappointed at the sheer lack of yum. This yummless, flavorless poop-patty with a tiny paper-thin, translucent slice of (what tasted like) ""pasteurized processed cheese-food"", made my tummy frown, and a tiny tear well-up in the corner of my eye, which I had to quickly wipe away before others at the table noticed my deep despair.  I had some lettuce on it, and some wack ""non-Heinz"" ketchup & mustard, and other than that, it was unadulterated. Let me say, it was no treat whatsoever. Aside from the burger itself walking a fine-line between blah, and a punch in the face, the lack-luster non-grilled bun was kinda cold, as if it was stored in a refrigerator or something. All in all, this burger sucked.  The Potatoes? Well, they were luke-warm or room-temp at best, but they were tasty. When our (very friendly) waitress Amanda stopped by to see how everything was, we let her know this (whilst pretending the burger was fine, because I'd rather lie and eat this bore-burger, than send it back for one with the cook's boogers and spit on it), and she was kind enough to bring out 2 hearty bowls of piping-hot delicious mashed potatoes. She rocks. In fact, her, and the potatoes, made the whole visit bearable.  I'm not saying I'll never get another burger at Applebee's again, but I will never EVER get another burger at Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
11,Jill B.,"New York, NY",0,39,,1.0,2016-03-13,"The food was ok, nothing special about it. The steak was over cooked and the chicken was over done as well.  The vibe here was awful all the way around. Not ONE single employee smiled the entire time we were there. Our server barely spoke and we both were friendly to her,  she was rude and acted upset we were there.  It was really strange, I don't know if something happened there earlier or what but everyone working was absolutely miserable, it wasn't just our server. No one was friendly and it was awful & awkward.  Definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
6,Bobbi K.,"Liverpool, NY",16,18,20.0,2.0,2016-05-13,Staff friendly food average and over priced service slow as a snail thought I was going to fall asleep waiting to pay my bill,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
9,Mark L.,"Cicero, NY",0,6,,1.0,2016-06-24,"Extremely rude staff. I came in for a pickup order and the lady who helped me demanded a tip from me. She said ""Now, do you want the full $7.27 back or are you gonna leave me a tip?"" Also, the food was terrible and it made me sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
8,Ethan L.,"Phoenix, NY",0,2,,4.0,2016-09-25,"I got the bourbon st chicken and shrimp with onions and red potatoes. This was my first time getting this item, and I have to say that it was good I also got an appetizer of onion rings which were cooked fairly well. The main course Was pretty good the bourbon chicken itself was cooked perfectly and had a char. The shrimp itself was had a nice ass to it and had some good Cajun spice. And the red potatoes were nice and crispy also the had of a good a good measure of salt. Over all the meal was good and I got it in a 2 for 25 so it was relatively cheap so that was nice. One of my netter Applebee's experiences. Over all 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
4,Jason L.,"Baldwinsville, NY",1,5,,2.0,2017-04-01,Long wait times for food the last few times I've been here. You also hardly ever see you waitress so good luck with refills  and such. To many better options In the area to choose this place again. The foods good but it's slow to get so not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
2,Becky R.,"Hannibal, NY",18,15,2.0,4.0,2017-09-27,"Went here for an early dinner today with my husband. We were seated in a booth (at our request) quickly and our server came to our table just as fast. (I believe her name was dessere, maybe destiny) she was very nice, smiling and eager to answer any questions we had as well as help my husband find the cheapest route to enjoy a good meal and stick to his diet. She filled us in on all the specials and even gave A quick rundown of specials they run other days for some things we were considering trying. I used the at table kiosk to order mozz sticks for an apetizer while deciding what we wanted for our entree. Those arrived just as the waitress was finishing taking our order. He got bone in wings and grilled shrimp. I ordered the (sorry if this is the wrong name) beer bacon grilled chicken, with green beans and mac n cheese. Our food was served quickly and the plating was very apealing. He loved everything he got. My meal.... The chicken had alot going on. I feel it could use a little less variety of toppings but overall it was pretty good. Green beans were topped with parmesean on bacon (a new one for me) and delicious. I wasnt a fan of the mac n cheese. Seemed rather bland and very dry. The sun started to shibe brightly through the window next to us during our meal and when i went to lower the shade discovered it was the only window in the place without one. So that was a little annoying. If it werent for those few things i wouldve given 5 stars. Recap of possitives, our waitress was great, most of the food was great and it was suprisingly affordable for what we got. I cant wait to try the steak or chicken wonton tacos next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,

1,C. K.,"Oswego, NY",0,19,,2.0,2017-11-28,"We Saturday after a long day of shopping what a disappointment.  I had the barbecue brisket tacos, no flavor, no meat, unless you call the ball of fat and grizzle i found in one taco.  The wife got the steak, looked and tasted like it was frozen and microwaved.  The side of broccoli was served stone cold.  live and learn, no matter how good it looks it wont taste that good it is a  chain restaurant.  Should have went to Copper Top",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liverpool-6,,,,,
