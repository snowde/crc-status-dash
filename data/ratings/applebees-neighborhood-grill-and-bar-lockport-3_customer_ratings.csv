18,Megan S.,"Rockville, MD",0,58,2.0,3.0,2013-08-09,Nice environment and service. Food is ok .  Don't order the Applebee Rib- the sauce didn't go into the meat. You can try the other kind of Rib,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
16,Kathleen B.,"Lockport, NY",38,203,108.0,3.0,2013-09-03,"I came on my lunch break got the soup and salad. How hard can that be? We waited 35 minutes for the food to come out and they put bread in my French onion soup when I asked for no bread, so I had to wait again for that. About a 10 minute wait. We asked for a refill on the soup and salad and waited for another 10 to 15 minutes. The waitress just didn't seem to care. A quick lunch turned into over an hour. Other tables around us Complained about the long wait for food and how their order wasn't right. Don't come here if you are pinched for time or are really hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
14,Michael W.,"Lockport, NY",44,25,,4.0,2013-10-24,"It's Applebees- fast food with beer.  The four stars are for that expectation-- Burgers, beer, pretzel sticks, salads, beer again.  If you're looking to compare to non-chain restaurants or your fancy-schmancy bistro, don't.   And stop being silly. Gone up a few notches since the remodel; consistency in the food even got better.  Sometimes crummy service, and the sides used to be slim pickins (that seems to be better of late)-- but they do just fine for when I just want a sammich/comfort beer and don't want to drive out of Lockport, and I'm too lazy to cook!  The Under 500 calorie menu is actually pretty good too.  4 stars because I like beer, and they have it, friendly staff serves it to me,  and those stupid pretzel sticks are really good comfort food with my comfort food bacon cheeseburger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
19,Rob W.,"Niagara County, NY",0,31,,4.0,2014-01-07,"The food is standard Applebees fare, and is well prepared along with a good beer selection (please bring back Magic Hat #9).  Only had an issue once in the dozens of times here, and the manager corrected it fast, and comped the meal!  The main benefit of this location is the outstanding service.  I will not go to most chains anymore due to incredibly slow, rude, and inappropriate service, but this Applebees has always had fast, polite and helpful servers and bartenders working there.  So for a quick, good meal, nice cold beer, and a little quick draw, This is the place to go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
12,Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63.0,3.0,2014-06-10,Typical Applebee's. Nothing fancy. Good food with not too bad prices. The waitress was super nice! Kudos to her!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
6,Kevin D.,"Regina, Canada",52,282,61.0,3.0,2015-04-04,"After buying a half rack of ribs ($13), an appetizer to split ($7) and desert ($4) I still left not feeling very full. After drinks, the price of this meal didn't match the amount we were given.  That being said, the food was delicious. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Tv's in every direction and tablets on the table - it feels like a classy sports bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
15,Adriano A.,"East Amherst, NY",0,8,,3.0,2015-07-17,The service is preposterous I ordered a cheese quesadilla and fries they give me a chicken quesadilla and no fries and same for my sister. and for my friend she ordered baby back ribs and onion rings and instead of onion rings she gets fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
1,Adam C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,5.0,4.0,2015-09-24,"The food is always good even though it takes awhile (being Applebee's) I usually get the American standard burger Every time I go inside the tables are kind of dirty. I'm usually seated fairly quickly. The servers are OK some of them are not too friendly honestly, at least when you ask questions they don't know the answer to. Every Time I use car side to go the blonde girl (I think Lily) is super nice and totally friendly. I'd love to have her wait on me but she said she isn't a server. Not to mention she always knows the answers to my questions.  Overall they are okay but you mine as well use car side to go since your house is probably cleaner than inside and the car side to go lady is nicer than the servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
17,Don K.,"Buffalo, NY",0,3,,4.0,2016-01-30,My wife and I stopped in for dinner here. The restaurant was clean and the staff pleasant. We both ordered burgers and a drink. The burgers were cooked exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The burgers were very flavorful and overall I would say both the food and service were better now than in our previous visit to this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
11,Tina F.,"Lockport, NY",0,1,,2.0,2016-02-21,"Went to dinner with my boyfriend tonight. Both of our  meals were extremely salty and both of our steaks overcooked. They offered to remake our food but we had already waited about 45 minutes so declined. Still ended up paying $60 for very sub par food. Given, we didn't expect 5 star going to applebee's, just a decent meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
10,Kelli D.,"Depew, NY",76,95,32.0,4.0,2016-03-16,It's Applebee's and the food is the same as you get at every other Applebee's. It's not very good but it's very cheap and it comes out very fast. My pasta was somewhat overcooked and my husband had an egg was definitely overcooked (though he grossly likes it like that). You get what you pay for. The place is clean and the waiters are friendly. They have those little computers where you can order refills and appetizers on it. You can also play games on them for an extra couple of dollars. There's a ton of TVs in here too. It's basically the same as every other Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
9,Michael D.,"Olean, NY",0,1,,2.0,2016-05-22,Currently sitting at the bar at the Applebee's in Lockport NY.  Got my drink in a timely fashion and was then ignored.  Took 30 minutes for the bartender to stop gossiping with her coworkers long enough to walk down towards me so that I could ask her to take my order.  Food is always fine here but I'm sick of the shoddy service.  Wish there was another decent option for late night meals nearby.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
13,K A.,"Lockport, NY",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-29,"Bravo Bravo!!! If you want a take-out order messed up .... Lockport 's Applebees is the place to go! Doesn't matter if you get carside or walk in and get it yourself, take the time to check it before you go home! If by chance you wait to go home and check it don't be surprised when you call to let them know that something, or many somethings are wrong with your order and then the manager (Ashley), proceeds to tell you that you , the customer, are in the wrong! Hysterical! Try to give this place a chance, tons of mistakes constantly, don't give them business for a few months, return and still the same! Lesson learned, support our local restaurants and to heck with these franchises that can't hire responsible competent help!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
7,Margarita S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,49,54.0,2.0,2016-08-17,"You can't even eat at this place. It's so cold I just walked in and left. It's understandable to have AC on blast when it's hot out..but it's 60 degrees outside right now. Last time I came here it was also cold but I luckily had a sweater. I ordered like 4 drinks and there wasn't any alcohol in them. It's like sugar water. I would get beer here bc then you at least know there is alcohol in it. Another time I came in here they had a CHILD SITTING AT THE BAR.  Which may not technically be against the law, I feel is bad form and opens the bartender to potential liability. Why not sit them at a bar table top instead?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
8,Danielle R.,"Tonawanda, NY",51,7,1.0,2.0,2016-12-19,"I recently had dinner here with my husband. Normally, I try to stay away from chain restaurants, but while we were in Lockport, we didn't have many options for a quick meal. As a former server, I normally don't (if ever) complain about my food, but I am certain if I took more than one bite of the chicken I ordered, I would have left feeling very sick. I can't remember the name of the meal, but it was breaded chicken with mashed potatoes, topped with onion rings. The chicken didn't taste like chicken - I felt like I was eating rubber, which makes me believe the chicken at one point was thawed, then frozen again. And the meal just all around had a horrible taste. I requested a few chicken tenders instead, and the waitress was understanding. Again, this complaint has nothing at all to do with our waitress, as we received great service, just the quality of the food and how it was prepared. I should have followed my gut and taken the extra couple minutes trying to find a local restaurant with better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
3,Arlene T.,"Ottawa, Canada",4,21,1.0,2.0,2017-03-30,"Ok, I can understand having to raise prices because the cost of product have gone up but when you also cut the portion sizes down with a price increase that really burns my biscuit! The hubby and I found ourselves in Lockport and needing lunch. Having gone to this chain many times before we figured it was a wise choice.  My Oriental Chicken salad, though good, was approximately 1/2 the size that it was as little as 3 years ago. The grilled chicken was warm at best. The hubby's Southwest Steak salad,again, though good, only had 3 oz (again that's a stretch ) or 5 small pieces of steak. Large enough greens, definitely more than mine, but very disappointing. These were ordered off the regular menu too.  Honestly, unless they, and I mean the whole chain, pull up their boot straps and give better value for the money, we won't be going to them again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
4,Jarrod B.,"Lockport, NY",33,15,,1.0,2017-09-12,It's apple b's. Dont expect much. Drinks are over priced. The food will Destroy your intestines and you'll leave feeling cheated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
5,Austin O.,"Lockport, NY",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-10-05,Only complaint is about the manager Dan as he is very disrespectful and rude. Everyone else is very helpful and respectful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
2,Natalie C.,"Lewiston, NY",150,1,1.0,2.0,2018-01-10,"Came in for a quick dinner. Happy hour apparently ended at 5:50 since the bartender Gabrielle delivered waters and ignored us until around 6. I'm a server so I understand bad days at work, but she did not check on us to see how our drinks or our food were and we were sitting right at the bar. She was very snippy with everything I asked. My boyfriend and I gave her many chances to redeem but she just got more rude as the night went on. My boyfriends entree came with less than half a cup of rice, and I asked for sour cream to which she sighed, and when I got it there were large pieces of apple in it. So I basically paid for apples dipped in sour cream. I didn't complain since she was obviously uninterested. When I was paying I gave her a card and told her it may not work since I couldnt remember if I activated it or not. She proceeded to swipe the card and loudly say ""this is declined."" Usually my tips are well over 20% but this is one of the very few times that it wasn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lockport-3,,,,,
