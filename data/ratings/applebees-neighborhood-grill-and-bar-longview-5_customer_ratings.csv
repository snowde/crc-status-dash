7,Sheryl M.,"Salem, OR",3,10,,2.0,2012-09-02,"I usually love Applebee's, especially when we are traveling we know we will have a good meal at the local Applebee's. I was very disappointed to receive my classic clubhouse grill sandwich not grilled, even more disappointed to find the bread had been burned to a black crisp and then turned inside out so it didn't show except for the edges. Not a very good attempt to hide poor cooking, why not grill 2 more pieces of bread?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5?start=40,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
4,Tasha P.,"Edgewood, WA",1,59,,2.0,2013-02-09,"Granted, it's been several years since I've been to an Applebee's, but I remember it being a lot better than this. The food is all greasy, and most things are more calories than a person should consume in a day, much less a single meal. There is not a single meatless entree on the menu (and the only things on the menu that are meatless are deep-fried appetizers).  The waitress was friendly enough, and happy to fill me in on the things that I was able to eat which were not on the menu. I left feeling like I'd eaten too much, and like puking might be imminent. (It wasn't, thank goodness!) Guess I won't be returning to an Applebee's for another few years.

We had to wait 30-40 mins, and by the time someone else brought us our lunch there weren't any silverware to eat our meal. We waited 10 more minutes, and the waitress was busy chatting with her friends than checking with her customers.

Eventually the waitress placed us next to a very loud and obnoxious table. We sat at our table next to these obnoxious people for about half an hour waiting to get any service, which was us asking to move to a different table so she pointed us to the bar. We went and sat in the bar and finally got to order a drink. We had one Dr. Pepper and one margarita. We sat and read the menus again and again and again. We finally got tired of waiting, so we signaled to the waitress in the bar to bring us our check and she still took a long long time to bring it over to us because she was chatting with her friends.  We paid for the drink we got and we left.

The fries were ok, they put a house seasoning salt on them which has green specks in it (I think it's parsley?). My cheeseburger was pink/red in the middle which is a huge turn off for me.

20,Dan B.,"Kelso, WA",0,6,,1.0,2016-12-27,"Applebee's is OK sometimes. Our most recent visit to this one was anything but. I'd love to review the food, however we didn't make it that far. When we walked in, the hostess told us it would be 5-10minute wait. That's fine. 15 minutes later we got a table, after perusing the menu for another 15 minutes without out any interest from a waiter we left.  Now, I can't say it was busy by any means as it looked like slightly over half the tables had anyone at them.  Typical Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

It took some time to have someone come to our table. Wait staff not the greatest, maybe having a bad day. Getting to the food. I had a ""New Steak Salad"" Greens were okay, but the steak, it was like what you would trim off of a steak. And it looked like someone threw it on the plate. The steak my husband had was chew and chew with no taste. will not be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

33,Gary P.,"Chehalis, WA",0,2,,1.0,2017-02-26,"Had a very unusual experience at this Applebee's yesterday. 1. Stood at the door for five minutes waiting to be seated. (There was nobody at the reception and no signage indicating whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone.) 2. Once seated, a waiter came and took our order for drinks, then returned with the drinks and took our order for an appetizer and two dinners. 3. We were completely ignored by the waiter from that point on. 4. After approximately 25 minutes, an apparent manager brought our appetizer to the table. 5. After another 20 minutes, a different manager brought our dinners to the table. 6. I asked for the bill. 7. The manager instructed me how to pay the bill using the electronic device on our table. 8. The bill automatically suggested a 20% tip be added to the $53 chargel. 9. I asked the manager about the destination of any tip, since our server had apparently been deliberately ignoring us all the while he continued attending to other nearby tables. 10. Manager stated that the system in that  restaurant was to share service duties among all the staff, not just one server. (This clearly was not the case with the table next to us, however, as we observed that table being served multiple times by the same employee ... as is done in all other restaurants I have ever patronized.) 11. We paid our bill and left the standard tip of 15%, as the manager pointed out that we had at least been taken care of even though our waiter had completely ignored us once the order was taken. 12. We left the restaurant feeling unsure what problem our presence had created for the waiter that was so offensive that we were repeatedly not acknowledged by him and which caused management to intervene to serve us. 13. Won't be patronizing Applebee's anytime again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

38,Scott Y.,"Kelso, WA",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-04,"went there for happy hour Friday night and asked to look at happy hour menu they hand you a bunch of menus. the draft beer was 4.25 a glass for domestic beer highest I've ever seen for happy hour, so I decided to order a happy hour drink for 5.50 . I ordered a margarita and she brought it in a martini glass, after asking for the check and waiting for 15 minutes while waitress and male manager stood around visiting I walked up and asked the bartender for it, she quickly brought it but they charged me for a total different drink I'm thinking on purpose. it was 899 instead of 550 and she new I wanted happy hour drink. anyway we left upset and forgot my phone on table because couldn't see it under all those menus. we won't be back plus could here a kid crying the whole time that was sat right next to lounge booths",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

Ordered a fresh cup of decaf coffee, had to send it back even though she said it was a new pot. Used their machine to request a server about the coffee, did it again after no one showed up for 10 minutes, AND another server walked by us four times and ignored our blinking red light!  Salsa and chips were good.  Had the riblets and the brisket tacos. Both were good and hot  Had to ring up the server again to get the check.  Liked the server. Didn't like that they turned the light down by half at 4pm, could hardly see! Also didn't like how the server that ignored our help light but had plenty of time to visit with her friends seated behind us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
27,Becca K.,"Cathlamet, WA",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-13,"I felt so bad for the waiter. He was a very good server, but as we sat at our table, we watched him run around frantically trying to make up for the cooks mistakes. The food was absolutely disgusting. I was disappointed that there is only one vegetarian entree option, which is a veggie burger. My bun was dry. The lettuce was soaking wet. I got four onion rings on the side. My honey liked his burger, but his fries had the texture of cardboard. As if they were baked in the oven for a very long time. At one point, our server asked us how the food was and we just broke out in laughter. I will NEVER eat at Applebees again. The only saving grace was the poor gentleman that works for the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

We enjoyed the sirloin steak and also the shrimp and chicken. Service was pretty quick considering they were rather busy. Good value for the amount of food received. Used a 5.00 off online order coupon so all in all no complaints. Also enjoyed the garden salad that we picked as one of our appetizers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-longview-5,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

And when they advertise specials of 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $20, make sure you specify that is what you are ordering, otherwise you won't get it. I'd give them 0 stars if I could.
