18,Michael S.,"Holland, MI",21,25,4.0,1.0,2012-06-16,"We went here late and were absolutely starving.  Normally that would make the food taste better but as usual, applebees is far from a fine dining experience.  I think taco bell would be better if they served alcohol.  The appetizer was half off but came in a ""hot"" dish and was stone cold.  My wife couldn't eat her food because it was too spicy and my pasta was undercooked.  Overall, my experience was a good reminder of why i try to avoid eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
20,Travis H.,"Fountain, MI",0,7,,2.0,2013-08-06,"Came in for a take out order. It took about 25 minutes just for one order of wings. While waiting at the bar I got to watch the staff in the kitchen eat food off plates with their plastic gloves on. Also curious as to how tips work there...the bartender was counting the tip jar and putting it in the register but also put some in his pocket and another waitress handed him a fold of money which he also put in his pocket. I would figure all tips are accounted for. Anyways, not somewhere I would go again for a quick takeout order",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
9,Marie S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",28,107,,3.0,2014-07-09,"As a general rule, we don't eat at Applebee's but our options were very limited after a long day of driving.  The restaurant recently reopened after a fire and it seemed they were still working the kinks out. The 20 minute wait time turned into 40 and they didn't have their lager system yet. After that, they were out of mint for mojitos and it took forever to get our food. The food was good for being Applebee's, really as long as you go in with not super high expectations, it's generally ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
12,Rebecca L.,"Ludington, MI",12,40,21.0,3.0,2014-08-05,"Standard Applebee's. The food is good and I have never had them get my order wrong. Typical sit-down casual restaurant. Good menu selection and they seem to change menus on a regular basis. They do offer some lower calorie options which are noted on the menu.  This location was recently re-built because the previous location was lost in a fire last Winter. The new look is consistent with the look of other newer stores. It now offers an outdoor seating area and is said to be a little bigger than it was preciously, however I don't see a huge difference.  A downside of the new Applebee's is that the waiting area is much smaller than it was in the previous building. They offer one bench and couple chairs, directly in front of the door that goes to the patio. It can get very crowded and busy when waiting and others are walking through.  They seem to be a little off with their wait times. We had a large party which may have had something to do with it. However there is a huge difference between a 20 minute wait and a 50 minute wait. The kids that were with us were getting a little restless, which I thought was pretty funny since we had to wait so much longer. There were other tables they could've arranged for us but apparently they wanted us in a certain area.  Most servers and staff seem to be pretty friendly. Decent food at a decent price. Nice atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
16,Aaron H.,"Scottville, MI",1,1,,1.0,2014-08-19,"I don't understand how this service could have gone so far downhill. The food was cold and tasted like plastic and our server checked on us 1 time. Our order was messed up but the waitress wouldn't have known that, she didn't bring any of our food out. After she took our order, she vanished only to return when the bill was ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
13,Andy L.,"Hart, MI",14,16,8.0,1.0,2014-08-21,"Wait time for food is unacceptable. Waited for over an hour with no explanation for the delay. Appears that everyone is waiting for food and becoming very anxious.  I'll be hesitant to return -  many other places in the area that is rather spend my time. I will add that our bill was reduced due to the wait which was a nice gesture.  It still would have been nice to have the delay acknowledged while it was happening.  Our server simply told us two different times that the food would be right out.   This is my second visit since the rebuild after the fire. Both times have had very similar service - not at all like it was in the past.   The new restaurant looks great, it's time to work on the customer service and get back to the great place everyone remembers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
15,John K.,"Cadillac, MI",0,14,,3.0,2014-10-18,I believe they are just growing pains but the wait times were long and the food was decent at best the last time we dined in. The two times since then we have ordered take out and it's been MUCH better than our in shop experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
17,Deeana S.,"Muskegon, MI",0,1,,5.0,2015-02-22,"Friendly Staff, great food.  Very happy with my choice in restaurants.  We were able to get a seat right away and the place was not even crowded.  Glad that there is such a good place for my family and I to go to dinner when we want to get out of the house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
11,Matt W.,"Hart, MI",2,18,2.0,4.0,2015-03-08,"My wife and I really love Applebee's and have been to the Ludington location many times. I skimmed through many of the reviews here and have to agree that the service is worse since they rebuilt. Our most recent visit was about 530 on a Saturday night just before supper rush and we we're seated right away.  We waited at least 30 minutes for our food with no real apology or explanation as others have noted.  My dad's dish was overcooked/burned, but he's not the type to say anything.  I ordered my steak medium well and it came definitely well done if not overcooked. I rarely complain at restaurants, but I love the house sirloin, so I told the waitress. They remade the steak and it was perfect and they also took it off the bill. The only thing I'd say is that they need to communicate more. The waitress was polite but wasn't apologetic and didn't tell us they were taking it off the bill, but I guess I shouldn't complain since they did. I still give them 4 stars based mainly on the quality of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
8,Robin W.,"Irons, MI",0,13,5.0,3.0,2015-07-11,Food was ok no real complaints but nothing great that I would say I need again.  Really slow when it came to dessert.  The food came out quickly but we had aid bill got receipt and still waiting on dessert.  The triple chocolate meltdown is amazing though the ice cream tasted a bit old.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
5,Nick M.,"New Albany, OH",66,301,14.0,3.0,2015-07-13,"It's Applebee's, you know you're getting average food at a reasonable price. This location is generally clean and has a friendly staff. Kind of tucked away but a great spot if you are staying at the Baymont Inn next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
10,Phil B.,"Lansing, IL",0,19,,4.0,2015-11-28,"The new menu is much better. I've given Applebee's a second look.  Waitstaff was attentive, the restaurant was remodeled/updated, and the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
6,Brenda W.,"Traverse City, MI",14,8,3.0,3.0,2016-07-19,"My husband and I quit coming here for a few years then discovered the lunch specials and service was great. So I brought my daughter there for her birthday.....no song was sung or dessert offered, and service was not so great. Months later, we try dinner here again, services was basic and minimal. Dinner was borderline cold and they nuked it for 1 minute and ruined the streak. We will be avoiding Applebees another few years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
14,Amy H.,"Westland, MI",20,3,,1.0,2016-07-29,"Horrible.  Had to wait to be seated, so yes they were busy but after we were seated it took over 30 min for our food to come. Potatoes were cold, my brothers pasta dish was cold, luckily my mother got a salad. Yes we could have sent the food back but we were so hungry we ate the cold food. The waiter did take 20.00 off our bill so that is something. Almost forgot my brother ordered onion rings to have with his pata, they finally came at the end of the meal, all 5 of them. I Will never go back to this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
1,Nikki S.,"Saginaw Charter Township, MI",4,39,13.0,3.0,2016-08-26,"Boy, it seems to be my day to write reviews that knock the service. We were here on vacation and left our B & B too late to hit the local restaurants we wanted to try. So we went to Applebee's, for their late hours. I seriously cannot recall what my dish was called, sorry. But it was tasty, a pile of garlic mashed potatoes, topped with chunks of steak, mushrooms, stout gravy, and little onion strings/rings. Hubby ordered the parm steak & shrimp. It came without the parm or the shrimp, so had to go back. When we finished eating, we waited...and waited...for our bill. We were never asked if we wanted another drink. Meantime, the 2 young men at the table across from us had a steady stream of waitresses, sometimes 2 at a time. Granted, we are senior citizens, but still...come on. You have one job. How about doing it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
4,Danny K.,"Lawton, MI",0,16,2.0,1.0,2016-09-15,The setting was very nice and clean. The service and food not so much. Our waiter was very snotty. I ordered the wood fire grilled sirloin and asked for it to be medium rare. It took our waiter 30 minutes to get our food and when I got it my potatoes had sour cream on them when I asked for no sour cream. My steak was well done even though I asked for a medium rare steak. When I asked for a new steak and potatoes the waiter snarled at me. The food was pricey. Worst Applebee's trip ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
7,W. B.,"Manistee, MI",0,1,,2.0,2017-01-07,Service was OK...We ordered an appetizer to have before the main food came but it didn't. it came with our main order.Last time I checked an appetizer came before you ate.she loved her order but mine was OK.i had a handful of Fry's at best with the burger....Was really disappointed this time. As we frequently go there.They had better improve the service and quantity of food or they will not have repeat customers like ourselves.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
3,Liz E.,"Ludington, MI",7,18,2.0,5.0,2017-02-01,"Consistent quality of food. Great variety-everyone can find something they like/can eat at this place. Great prices, large serving sizes, good service. Senior discount upon request. I love the pick 2 on the back menu-getting to try a nice size portion of two of my favs.  It's right next to the movie theatre-so very handy to stop and get a bite before or after a movie. This is one of two non fast food chain restaurants in Ludington-so far. (The other being Big Boy). The original Applebee's at this location burned down, this replacement is 'new', 'modern' and 'clean.' Eat here if/when you want a known restaurant experience. But do definitely try the other unique eateries of the greater Ludington area too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
2,Jill H.,"Ludington, MI",12,25,32.0,3.0,2017-05-14,Ordered my steak medium. Came to me done. And was way over cooked and brunt. My boyfriend was the same way. The loaded mac and cheese didn't even look like mac n cheese. No seasoning on our steaks. Needed salt n pepper. Waited way to long for it. They 2 nd steak was cooked a lot better but still no season but very juicy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ludington-2,,,,,
