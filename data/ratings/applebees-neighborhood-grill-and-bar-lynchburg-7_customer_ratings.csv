13,Sara M.,"Lynchburg, VA",6,62,14.0,1.0,2012-01-31,Bad bad bad! Even for an Applebees! I was served frozen garlic mashed potatoes there. I'm not saying that they were frozen once upon a time... they were STILL frozen when I bit into them!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
11,Rob C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,33,1.0,1.0,2013-10-02,It smells really bad. Like the carpet has been very wet. The service was fast but it was after 2 pm. I ordered a sandwich with fries. I also asked for some ranch dressing for my fries. Then when I received the check they charged me .25 for the ranch. I asked why and she said all restaurants are charging that. I disagreed with her. I asked why she didn't tell me about the extra charge and she said she had been telling everybody for 2 weeks and thought I would know. I DONT live here. I won't go back to any restaurant that charges for a ranch dressing side. Very stupid of Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
10,L M.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,15,,1.0,2014-05-24,My son got what we believe was a case of food poisoning after eating the quesadilla burger there earlier this week. He was very ill within a few hours and exhibited all of the signs and symptoms.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
12,Michael C.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,134,,2.0,2014-12-27,"Not the best Applebee's experience. Service was fine.  Some sort of permanent stain on the table.  A featured pasta shrimp broccoli dish was terribly bland.  If it is Christmas Eve with everyone else closed, then try it.  That was our excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
8,Jasmine B.,"Lynchburg, VA",8,3,5.0,1.0,2015-06-21,The 3chese chicken pene is such a waste of money seriously I could make this at home for $5.  Service good. Food CHEAPLY MADE  I should have went to Walmart waste of money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
9,Niki M.,"Lynchburg, VA",24,2,,1.0,2015-07-12,Just went to the Applebee on old forest road. The server was great. Ordered and got our drinks and appetizers.  Half way through eating our chips and spinage and artichoke dip We were horrified to find alive cockroach running around inside the chips we were eating.  Would never recommend this place or go back. Horrible. Have already called corporate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
7,Jeffrey C.,"Philadelphia, PA",131,80,41.0,3.0,2016-04-04,"This is a typical chain Applebee's restaurant. When here with my family getting various dishes including the appetizers which consisted of mozzarella sticks and chicken wings which were both very good. The sauce on the chicken wings is always impressively covering the chicken wings. We also got various dishes which included chicken-based, sirloin base, and pasta dishes. The chicken in Sterling dishes were good, but the pasta dish was bland and lacked flavor that was memorable, rather it was bland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
6,Joshua P.,"North Ridgeville, OH",60,2,1.0,3.0,2017-01-10,Service was great. Waitress was very friendly and was always returning for refills. Ordered a Triple Bacon Burger and asked for them to cook it as raw as they are allowed and it was still cooked to medium with no pink in the middle. Other than that everything was fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
5,Brian M.,"Lynchburg, VA",12,6,,3.0,2017-02-24,"The girl who seated us had zero personality and acted like she couldn't be bothered, but our server was quite the opposite. She was very friendly and attentive. Food was ok. Tried something different than normal and it wasn't anything to get excited about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
4,Pam H.,"Lynchburg, VA",9,1,,1.0,2017-03-04,The worst place to eat. Yeah they have good food but it takes them almost forever to get your food especially if you're doing the carside to go.....never again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
3,Pamela W.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,12,11.0,1.0,2017-10-21,"THE worst food and service ever. The Bedford Applebees location is horrible, the Applebees at the Candlers Mountain Road location is horrible, so we figured we would give this one a shot. We are done with Applebees all together. Go to Chili's instead. Not worth the money at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
0,Brandon W.,"Oak Harbor, WA",122,1,1.0,5.0,2017-11-14,Great place to eat all the people who gave less then five stars are ass holes and don't appreciate good food.  United States Veteran-,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
2,Devan C.,"Lynchburg, VA",5,159,225.0,1.0,2017-12-01,I ordered myself a 1 dollar long island iced tea. It actually does taste watered down from reading previous reviews of other customers that had the long island iced teas previously.  I waited 5 minutes to receive my drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
1,Ryan D.,"Lynchburg, VA",17,39,2.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"Literally the worst restaurant in the world.  I gave the server a gift card and cash, and he used all of the cash first, then for the remainder he partially used the gift card. Now I have a balance on a card to a restaurant I never want to step foot in again. Thanks moron. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lynchburg-7,,,,,
