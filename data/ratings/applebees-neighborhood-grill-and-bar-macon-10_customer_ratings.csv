15,Xena J.,"Juliette, GA",0,23,,1.0,2015-11-04,"I don't know if all the Applebees are like this now, but it was awful.  The place is extremely loud.  It had about 10 flat screen TVs going with different ballgames.  The volume was turned loudly on all of them. The service was good, but the food was horrible.  Mediocre bar food at best. Applebees used to have decent food. Have they done a corporate makeover or something?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
14,Bailey S.,"Talbotton, GA",12,10,1.0,1.0,2015-11-22,Service was horrible food was okay. Took a long time to get our order in. The restaurant was about half full and servers just standing around. If you have a lot of time to waist this is the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
13,Mike P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,11,,1.0,2015-12-20,"Just keep on driving. Poorly managed, if a manager even exists. Our server was ok, but she only had so much to work with. Kitchen out of food, table guys not cleaning and setting tables, but watching the game on tv instead. Food that was available was pretty crappy. Servers back by bathroom register talking about punching people in their head?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
9,C F.,"Newport, RI",1,20,,4.0,2015-12-30,Average Applebee's experience with more friendly staff.   We showed up around 6pm and were seated at a hi-top immediately  Trivia games are $2 if you touch the tablet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
16,MoDa Q.,"Atlanta, GA",592,1,2.0,1.0,2016-02-16,"Came into Applebee's on Zebulon RD on Monday 2/15/16.@320-330 There were not many people in restaurant but there was a dirty table full of dishes directly across from me the entire time I was there 1.5 hours)  Saw waitress ( Kimberly add trash to the table saw Hostess look at the table several times before partly removing some of the Dirty cups and plates. I ordered Double crunch bone in wings with a Caesar Salad. Wings came out but not Salad ( told waitress Jessica) who brought food out but was not person who took my order,( Kimberly took order) I'm missing salad. Salad never comes out I'm almost done with Wings Kimberly returns I tell her I ordered Salad she says let me go check. She comes back to tell me its ready... I tell her cancel it I'm done eating. Kimberly tells me they made Salad but it wasn't brought out. Im thinking how was I to eat if if if was never brought to my table. I again tell her I don't want it now we are about to leave.. Reluctantly she had it taken off my bill.. Terrible service again.... Will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
12,Bryan S.,"Milledgeville, GA",0,5,,1.0,2016-03-21,"Went here around time it first opened in summer/fall 2015.  Bad service.  Follow up with manager was promising, but didn't follow through on promise to email coupon for free dinner.  Other options in the immediate area, so I'd give them a try before coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
8,Amanda B.,"Macon, GA",14,12,,2.0,2016-04-09,Service is lousy.. We ate at the bar thinking that we would have good service and we were proven wrong..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
10,Amanda G.,"Macon, GA",1,3,3.0,4.0,2016-05-01,"I love this place.  Real Atlanta look of a sports bar.  We always sit at the bar, but the downside to sitting there is sometimes the waitstaff negativity.  Bartenders are the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
11,C C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,86,,1.0,2016-05-09,"Decided to stop here with my mom recently for a quick dinner one Saturday evening. Should've known the experience was going to be bad after we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated when the restaurant wasn't even full... Right after we received our drinks, the fire alarm went off. No one seemed concerned or mentioned anything to us, and the alarm blared on and on and on. Our waitress never apologized and in fact was down right rude. She walked by and said ""well it's just noise"" when we contemplated just paying for the drinks and leaving. Well yeah, but I'm not spending money to sit in silence with my fingers plugged in my ears! A friend of mine was actually eating with his parents there at the same time, and he mentioned how his waiter apologized for the inconvenience profusely. Our food took forever to arrive and came out at different times. I had a question about my food when it arrived and I was met with another defensive and rude comment from the waiter. We also had to wait for silverware and when I asked for a to go box, I opened the box up only to find a hair in it. I'm usually very easy going at restaurants but haven't had a waiter be that blatantly rude in years. My mom and I were actually both shocked with her attitude and how we were treated. The food was lackluster and I can't believe we didn't even receive a coupon or a simple apology for the experience of sitting through the never ending alarm. The floor had trash all over as well, and a dirty table near us was never cleaned off. I will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
6,Denise B.,"Savannah, GA",2,8,4.0,5.0,2016-07-16,Our meals were really good. I had the grilled salmon and vegetables while my son had an 8 oz sirloin and almost licked the plate. I have eaten here before but today was really great. Service was great too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
7,J J.,"Macon, GA",0,8,,3.0,2016-08-27,"The food is good here and the place is nice and clean. They need to work on the service here. Twice I've been placed in dead sections where there seems to be no server assigned. The good thing is that a good server will find out that I need service and will come by, but it is so awkward to have to wait until someone figures it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
5,Mike W.,"Marietta, GA",74,75,36.0,3.0,2016-10-01,"I returned to this location last night. The service left a lot to be desired. They are severely understaffed for peak times. The servers and welcomers are extremely nice, but they can only do so much at one time. Nonetheless, the food wasn't that good this go around. Everything took a long time to come out and when we finally did get our orders it felt rushed. Unless you can go during a bone peak time, I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
2,Mina K.,"San Diego, CA",90,117,313.0,2.0,2016-10-30,"Kids food was ok but that's about it !  I ordered sirloin with whole grains and man , the meat tasted really bad ! And so did everything else that came with it.  Save your money and go to buffalo's or even Chilli's where you can get better quality food for the same price !  Oh, and the wait for food ( not to be seated was long also ) with an almost empty restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
3,Amy S.,"Macon, GA",24,10,2.0,2.0,2017-01-31,Terrible. Order was wrong took forever. It was not crowed at all and it was lunch time. Fries were so salty I could not eat them. And the to go glass is a joke. It's a child's cup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
0,Jesse F.,"Lizella, GA",0,18,18.0,3.0,2017-08-06,"It's Applebee's. This location had large screen televisions everywhere. I am not interested in CNN or ESPN while I am trying to enjoy my meal. Also they have these tablets on every table. When I go out to eat with the family, staring at an electronic device is not my idea of a good time. Also , when I was ready to pay, the tablet adds a 20% gratuity automatically. Come on guys.  The service and food was typical Applebee's. Nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
1,Jimmy C.,"Macon, GA",3,1,2.0,1.0,2017-09-12,"I haven't been to this particular Applebee's before, so me and my girlfriend decided to stop by to try it out before a movie. At first glance, the place looked really cool, and the new style bar area was very inviting. We ordered one of their 2 for $20 deals which came with an appetizer and 2 entrees. The issue I have with this experience are these things: the waitress brought out our appetizers first followed immediately my entree. Nothing to eat with. No silverware. Asked for that so we could eat. Took 10 min to get that. We just stared at the boneless wings until we finally got that. My gfs burger still hasn't arrived, so we munched on the appetizer. After a few more min, her burger came, and it was the wrong side order as well as a hamburger that was bleeding all over her plate into her fries she didn't order. We told our waitress about the multiple issues, and she took the plate back. I finished all of my food and sat to wait on her food to arrive. It still took another 20 min or so before she got her food and STILL never not one time an apology for the issues with this meal. It's the least someone could do to be honest. The food issue wasn't as bad as the rudeness of not acknowledging the issues we had with an apology. We don't ask for much, but that's just human nature to us. Don't be ignorant. May come back, may not...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
4,Zohaab K.,"Macon, GA",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-09-21,"I walked into the establishment for the first time because it was getting late and most restaurants were closing. When we entered, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and modern decor. Our waitress was amazing! The wait for the food is moderate. But when I received the food, for the price I was paying,  I was sadly underwhelmed. I got the 6oz sirloin with macaroni. I asked to get it without bacon. I received the macaroni, and it had bacon in it even though I asked to have it without. She came back to tell me that the macaroni could not be without bacon AFTER I got the food. But all in all the food was good but the serving is underwhelming. Would not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-macon-10,,,,,
