9,David C.,"Jackson, MS",2,11,2.0,1.0,2014-04-10,"Today we were doing some shopping and thought we'd have fun and grab some drinks and dinner while out, so we tried this Applebee's. It has serious issues. We sat at two different tables, and both were crusted with old food, and the tabletop displays of drinks were also covered in crud. They hadn't been cleaned in ages. Even more, at our second table, we sat across from a table that was filthy with trash on the floor, and no one, not manager, waiter, or host, would pick it up. Also, the back of our booth was stacked with condiments and old drinks. We tried to make the best of it, but the service was horrible. The waiter has this awkward manner of staring blankly at you while taking your order, and didn't know how to open a conversation, eg, ""May I prepare some drinks for you while you review our menu?"". Finally the food. The quality is deteriorating. It had been three years since we ate at Applebee's last, and though the food was never great, it was a good place for some drinks and food. Not now. My wife's steak was nearly raw. She ordered it medium rare, and got black and blue. Also, the meat was terribly freezer burned. I ordered chicken and shrimp with peppers and onions. The chicken was so chemically marinated, that it was rubbery and tasted of chicken flavoring, not chicken. The onions and peppers were drenched in oil, and the shrimp were little rubber erasers. We used to come here for drinks, and my wife's favorite was the mudslide with the chocolate swirls on the glass. Not this time. Here drink arrived with the chocolate dumped one spot and the bottom of the glass, and there was no discernible flavor of alcohol. It was just a milkshake. Overall, it wasn't worth the money at all, even if they charged me only half of what I payed. I've had better food and cleaner tables at roadside taco trucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
8,Jus P.,"Lexington, MS",95,33,131.0,3.0,2014-08-30,"I was about to write a good review until the server brought out dirty dishes with my appetizer. Then he brought mild wings when I asked for honey BBQ. They're usually pretty good, hence the 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
6,Theresa D.,"Brandon, MS",21,9,11.0,1.0,2015-11-28,"The door states open till 11:00 on Thanksgiving. We got to the host stand at 10:20 and was told ""we are closing at 10:30."" We politely said ""Oh sorry.. The door states the hours for the holidays, and it said 11:00 today."" So we were told we could place a to-go order if we wanted.  There are so many great places to eat in this area. It being the only place open should be the only reason you choose to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
7,Sarah H.,"Madison, MS",0,2,,1.0,2016-04-27,"One of the Worst restaurant in Madison. Not even sure how it's still opened. Horrible service!!! waited for 15mins and no one ever came buy to get our drink orders, they were all too busy talking and cutting up in the section they said was ""closed"".. Lazy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
5,Daniel M.,"Orlando, FL",27,7,1.0,1.0,2017-01-07,"Horrible service. Hostess stated she had no booths, so we took one of their high tables by the bar. Sat down at approximately 5:00 pm for over 20 minutes without a waiter or waitress taking our order. 5:23 pm, Still no waiter or waitress in sight. 5:31 pm still no server! Was so looking forward to eating here tonight. This place needs to close or change ownership. Horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,

3,Bill S.,"Madison, MS",29,2,,1.0,2017-09-16,"The food was mediocre at best. Our party of 10 had food delivered to the table over a 45 minute time span. Most items came out 1 at a time, but once 3 people got their steak. Should have gone to McDonald's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
1,Popa D.,"Jackson, MS",198,39,20.0,1.0,2017-09-18,"Eat somewhere else... Walked in, there were more employees than customers. Employees see me walk in, they ignore me. Finally a young man asks me if I need any help...told him I was waiting to be seated. He tells me this is the back entrance and that I would have to walk 15 feet to my left to get seated. He looks at me like I'm from another planet. I try not to react to it, but I do. The look he gives me and his attitude towards me makes me boil. I want to leave...but I can't because I'm meeting someone there. I'm annoyed and my date knows it, not a good look for me. we finally get seated. It took way too long for them to bring our drinks. I mean we were practically the only ones there. My date couldn't get a freaking baked potato because they don't make that til 5pm. Come on now.....her supposed potato soup looked more like mashed potato with a few bacon bits sprinkled in. My food was okay. As I listen to my date talking, I look around and observe my surroundings. The place is dirty. The cloth on the backs of the booths are saturated with old stains for who knows how long. The place wasn't just dirty, it was nasty. And I was still annoyed with the pissant that was giving me an attitude for coming in through the wrong entrance. Apparently the customer is not always right at this applebee's location. Anyway our server Jada was very sweet and polite and positive. She was the only saving grace. Except that she probably should've let us have the baked potato. Anyway....don't eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
0,Anita R.,"Springfield, MO",107,28,1.0,3.0,2017-11-18,To start off we Love Applebee's.  Lots of times our go to place when traveling.  We walked into this one and the hostess (Mikala) asked if we wanted to be seated near the bar. We told her we preferred a booth away from the bar.  Several boots were available but she was making excuses why we couldn't sit there but finally seated us.  A man and his children came in after us and he was immediately sat in the booth behind us.  Also she should keep the wrapped silverware away from her mouth The only reason I gave this 3 stars is we were satisfied with the food.   Service was not great,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
2,Virginia R.,"Madison, MS",135,18,2.0,1.0,2017-11-19,We have been here many times over the years and always say I will not be back. Our waitress informed us she was due to be off but because we came in she had to stay. It was 4 in the afternoon. She ended up leaving and another waitress started helping us. We couldn't get refills. The music was so very loud you could hardly talk. Ticket had to be sent back 3 times because of Incorrect items on the bill. Value for the food was good but not worth putting up with staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madison-14,,,,,
