2,Adam G.,"Malden, MA",89,192,165.0,2.0,2012-11-12,"Crapplebee's. That's all I have to say. While my new apartment is within a stone's throw from this location I will say I would rather throw stones at this restaraunt than eat here. The service while very friendly was unacceptably slow, especially when you consider this is a chain restaurant. When the food came, I was glad to eat but unimpressed with my burger which was slightly dry as were the onion rings. Not to be political, but since the CEO of this Chain is one of the ""I'm going to lay off people because of Obamacare"" crybabies, I am proud to boycott this restaurant. I'm sure they are laying off people because people hate Applebee's. "" That place was hell, it was like Applebee's with a bar! Oh wait, Applebee's has a bar. It's like Applebee's..."" -Roger Smith, American Dad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden,,,,,
3,Thomas B.,"Fall River, MA",0,16,,1.0,2013-01-16,"I ate at a different Applebee's before and had a good experience.  However, even though It was not very busy, the service was slow, forgetful, and did not bring the correct order. My wife barely touched her food because it was cold and not very tasty she said, I had the riblets they were okay but nothing to write home about. The waitress kept on coming by and apologize for what ever went wrong. When it came to checking out, she gave me the wrong check it was approximately $50 too much. When I pointed this out to her, she apologized and then brought me the correct check. We are very easy to please, we just asked for hot food and friendly service. However we will not return to this Applebee's.. Maybe we went on the wrong night, or it was just an off night. It was not very busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden,,,,,

7,Alexis J.,"Medford, MA",65,212,10.0,4.0,2013-04-09,This Applebee's is MUCH better than it's neighbor in nearby Dorchester. We've been there a couple times and the food and service have always been pretty good. Our last waitress (J'nai I think) was fantastic. Super friendly and attentive. We now always drive to this location because it's not terrible (but not great either).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden,,,,,
4,Mei C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,2.0,2013-06-05,"I love Applebee's. But not this one.  The night we were there they were not even busy. yet we've waited forever to see our server for the first time. She was leaning on the table next to us instead of standing close to us to write down our order attentively. I ordered the 2 for $20 with chicken strips, she didn't ask me the sauce and when the food was here she gave me a sauce I normally won't order. I am fine with that but then I never get to see her until we're almost done with our food. My water empty and our waitress was busy chatting with the table behind us, didn't even bother to ask us if everything was okay. The only time we get to see her without waiting forever was when we pay the bill. Oh and the food - We have spinach and artichoke dip for appetizer but the chips are very greasy. The dip is decent though. For my chicken strips with fries, they put so many salt on the fries it's inedible. As we walk out we saw our server chatting with her colleagues at the entrance, I don't know about others but I'd assume she had been busy socializing with her colleagues than taking care of her tables. I would not come back to this one. The only reason for 2 stars is the delicious brownie bite. It was probably warmed with microwave but it's so good with the vanilla ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden,,,,,
6,David B.,"Medford, MA",39,49,3.0,4.0,2013-08-15,"Pretty good. Compared to other Applebee's the service was solid, prices were obviously good and the food was pretty ok . The dessert we got was outstanding (chocolate meltdown). Lets face it, not looking for anything special when coming here but I was pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden,,,,,
