15,Ken B.,"Marshall, MI",1,81,1.0,2.0,2014-04-13,I have been to Applebees all over the country and this one is ok. A very young waitstaff that does an ok job. The new pertzal appetizer is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
13,Tim K.,"Marshall, MI",24,9,,5.0,2014-04-30,"This is the friendliest Applebee's I've ever been in!!! Always polite, knowledgable servers. The food is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
14,Richard S.,"Berkley, MI",24,17,14.0,5.0,2014-07-07,Haven't been to an Applebees for a very long time. My wife and I had the 2 for 20 dinner.  Includes an appetizer.  Yelp check in allowed us to get an additional appetizer for free.  We left very satisfied and with money in my pocket.   Their Spinach and Artichoke app and their Pretzel app were outstanding.  We will be back for sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
16,Scott A.,"Marshall, MI",0,34,5.0,2.0,2015-02-24,"This particular location appears to be very poorly run.  I've had good experiences there but they are far outweighed by terrible service, sporadic food delivery and poor food quality.  I believe I've been comped more times than I've paid for in the last year.  In general it just appears poorly managed, most of the young staff is just going through the motions because they haven't been well trained.  The cooking staff doesn't seem to get any rhythm going.  The only high light is a server named Judson who if he is there we ask for by name.  He will try to make the experience enjoyable and he is on top of your order.  When the place went from corporate to franchise it seemed to lose its way and hasn't found it yet.  They quit having free kids meals for those kids showing up in local sports uniforms during the transitions, this used to be the go-to place after Saturday morning soccer games. But not anymore.  I'll probably still try it every month or so but I don't expect much.  It doesn't have to change because there is little competition.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
6,Joe C.,"Battle Creek, MI",35,152,403.0,5.0,2015-05-10,Very good service today for a holiday.  Went there for mother's day and didn't have to wait but 5 minutes for a seat. Even though the place was packed full of hungry mothers we got our food in the normal time.   The staff was very friendly and kept the drinks coming. Food was prepared well and hot. We had a Yelp bonus upon checking in and received a bar snack for free for checking in.  We got the fried green beans and they were excellent. When we got our bill we noticed that they charged us for the bar snack but when brought to their attention they promptly removed the charge and apologized.  Great mothers day dinner and we all enjoyed ourselves.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
10,Matt S.,"Burlington, MI",7,41,31.0,3.0,2015-10-19,Real slow service and the order went in wrong. The manager made it right without me asking. The shredded beef tacos are pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
11,Ben F.,"Perrysburg, OH",15,2,,1.0,2015-11-27,"The food is not very good and expensive.  I haven't eaten at an Applebee's in a long time and I won't be going back anytime soon.  If you can't get lunch for less than $15, it's a problem.  The staff is friendly but the menu and quality of food is just terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
12,Chris W.,"Marshall, MI",0,2,,2.0,2016-02-14,"Not impressed with the new menu (again)! We had two for $25 and our house salad was good, we ordered two of them with no cucumbers but only got one salad cucumber free. And we order the 6 oz rib eye steaks with garlic mashed potatoes.  We received our salads and only one of us received silverware. We both ordered our steaks medium and mine was almost rare.  Also our garlic mashed potatoes just tasted washed out, not much flavor and not very much on the plate, but they put 3 deep fried onion rings to fill the plate, ""gross""! It did not say anything on the menu about getting onion rings as part of this meal.  My waitress was asked to bring butter for the mashed potatoes and we did not see the butter until we were 3/4 of the way thru our meal. The steaks used to be marinated, now they are really bland! Can't say that our $32 meal on Valentines Day was a good memory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
3,Anna Y.,"Kalamazoo, MI",30,7,1.0,5.0,2016-05-18,"I'm usually not a huge fan of large restaurant chains, however we met up at Applebee's after work for a few happy hour drinks, we ended up staying for quite a few hours, and even though we only ordered drinks and an appetizer our waiter Zach was stellar.  He made sure to check on us all night, got us refills before we needed them and never made us feel rushed.  Great service goes a long way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
9,Nicole C.,"Marshall, MI",0,3,,3.0,2016-06-26,"Most of the time we come here, we get very good service. The menu has quite a bit, however I have never been too impressed with the meal. I like that they do have some more healthy-ish items listed now.  Still, the food is pretty sub-par, and when the bill comes around I'm a little disappointed with the quality of what we pay for. But hey, at least they have booze.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
7,Greg A.,"Portage, MI",71,17,,1.0,2016-07-01,"Got right in and got seated. Took about 15 minutes for us to order, and about 20 minutes to get our water. Ordered a Margarita & a beer and after 30 minutes still haven't received our drinks. So, after 35 minutes of waiting for my beer I'm told that they don't have it so I ordered a different one from the tap. Drinks finally came after 40 minutes. So, they just brought out another beer for some reason. Totally unorganized! They are messing up orders on both sides of us, lol. Just shy of an hour all the food came at once. After they dropped off our food they left us without silver wear. Add another 10 minutes for silver wear. Food was absolutely sub-par. They screwed up out bill over charging us $3.50. In conclusion horrible food, and horrible service. Will never go back to this location!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
2,Shawn S.,"Marshall, MI",15,24,9.0,4.0,2016-10-01,"The ribs and steak were great, but my husband ordered applesauce as a side and they gave him one of the single-serve squirt containers like you pack in your 8 year-old's lunch box. I found that odd. Seriously, you can't even squirt it into a bowl for a 50 year-old customer??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
8,Kathy S.,"Lansing, MI",0,11,,5.0,2017-01-22,"We love this Applebee's!  This location is the best, they have team work here, and will do there best to make sure you are completely satisfied.  We have been going there often, and get Great service along with Great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,

1,Jessica A.,"Fort Wayne, IN",27,5,,3.0,2017-06-24,Had Applebee's for drinks and dessert on a Friday night. Great blondie and great deal on late night drinks. Service was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
4,April R.,"Marshall, MI",0,1,,3.0,2017-08-01,Food is usually pretty good. We go mon-wed because they have kids eat free which is great! Drinks are always good and on the cheaper side. Service is sub par though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marshall-13,,,,,
0,Keghan L.,"Marshall, MI",35,5,,5.0,2017-12-07,"If you were to compare this Applebees to the one in Battle Creek, this one if 5 Star. Food is better. Service is better.
