54,Mo M.,"Seattle, WA",113,144,843.0,1.0,2013-06-29,"Gift card needed to be utilized. Dammit all. Tips for this Applebee's location: - Have a manager on duty. Like, physically in the building. - Train the staff to check on customers and give them hydration, like water. - Require the staff to say hello and even thank you, and KNOW THE MENU. - Explain to the servers they may want to check on and care for customers that are not their drunk friends at the tables around the strangers. - Teach the little aproned ones to write down orders so they get it correct. - Advise the minions that mistakenly deliver your food to another group that it is unsanitary to deliver such food to two tables after it has been touched. - Hire a jobless human to clean the disgusting sticky menus and condiments at the little stands on each table, they are ALWAYS FILTHY and dogeared.  - Stop brining your meats in salt solution so it lasts longer and saves you money. - Remove the dangerous preservatives, like sodium nitrite and MSG from all your sauces and dressings. Hello reaction! Oh, what the hell, hire a new manager or staffers who care about your brand and customers in general. Tips for yelpers:  Re-gift those gift cards.  Avoid unless drunk, underage and desperate on I-5.

My husband asked the waitress if the drink came with a gummy worm and the response was, ""I can't really see and the only way for me to tell is by sticking my finger in it and I can't because I am on shift. They may not have any gummy worms left."" We then asked for her recommendation on the quesadilla burger or ribs and she said that the burger was terrible and she didn't know what the ribs because she cannot get herself to eat ribs. When I asked her about the chicken penne with sundries tomatoes, she didn't know because she hadn't tried it. Then I ordered an ultimate trio, where the buffalo wings looked like they had been sitting out for a while and the pretzel looked like it has been warmed up in a microwave.

I also asked for it to be pink since the menu itself said they would be pink if you wished it that way. When I had finally gotten my meal the burger was burnt, and cold on top of that. There was no pink and the waitress did nothing about it when I said that it was supposed to be pink.

One of them, which was a snowboard, was halfway over my husband's head! Then to add to it, each item had four inch nails sticking out of them!

There were plenty of staff working, but we seemed to be ignored at every turn.  We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door, 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence at a table, and another 15 before out drinks came out. Finally drinks came out. Ordered food, another 20 minute wait. Then Ashley our waitress starts bringing out our kids dinners. While trying to set our sons dinner on the table, she spilled an entire glass of strawberry lemonade on our table...most of which landed right in my husbands lap..running off the table in EVERY direction, also getting our 5 yr olds pants.  She apologizes, hands him a single napkin, and then leaves to continue to bring more kids food out.  A SINGLE NAPKIN to clean up soaking wet pants and a dripping table.  We had to ask another server for a towel so hubby could clean his pants off. They were literally dripping wet. Kids food was all looked ok.15 minutes later my husband and my food came out. Our kids were done eating before we even got our food. I ordered the shrimp/parm/steak medium well with mash potatoes and veggies.  One end of my steak was practically mooing, and the other end was burnt.  Not sure if they get the concept of medium well....it was nasty and hard to eat...especially since only the 1/3 in the middle was done right. Potatoes were cold in the middle, and rock hard on the outside like they had been sitting under the warming light all day.  Hubby had a rack of ribs and fries. Fries were so cold they felt frozen, no seasoning.  As we were finishing up our meal, the waitress offered my husband a free little glass of chocolate mousse to apologize for the spilling the drink. I am pretty sure my mouth literally fell open, because she then went to get the manager that approved a 10% discount on our bill.  Still very insulting considering EVERYONES dinner was ruined, my son and husband were both wet and our food was terrible.  When we got the bill, all they did was put the 10% discount on my dinner (the less expensive of the 2 adult meals.  For our $75 dinner we got drenched, horrible food, and insulted.
