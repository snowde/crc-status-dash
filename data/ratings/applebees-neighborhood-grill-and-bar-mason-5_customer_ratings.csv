24,Caroline W.,"Mason, OH",37,118,13.0,2.0,2012-12-24,"Applebee's serves typical chain food - steaks, burgers, chicken tenders, etc. It's not my kind of place but every once in a while family demands that we go here and so we do. I never expect anything to taste out-of-this-world but I do at least expect to get what I ask for. I usually get steaks when eating at these types of places. I've had things like the bourbon street steak, but they always wind up doused with sugar - I just want a steak, not candy. This particular time I got the 2 for $20 to split with my husband. We both ordered the house sirloins with broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes.  I would have given Applebee's a 3 star if they would have cooked the meal right, but they didn't. My ""rare"" steak was so over done it didn't have a drop of pink in it, and the broccoli was crunchy and clearly not done enough. The mashed potatoes were just fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5?start=20,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

22,Kelly K.,"Cincinnati, OH",17,8,1.0,1.0,2015-04-03,"My family and I just visited the local Mason Applebee's. The only reason for the 1 star is because the food was decent. Our waitress said 13 words to us the entire time! Not willing to admit she messed up when she didn't put our order of green bean fries in really upset us. When preparing to leave I asked (assuming they did) if they excepted military discount, she shook her head with a blank stair. I asked the hostess because we read they support the troops, she said yes. Needless to say the waitress came back with correct answer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5?start=20,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

The place is a mess, at least ten tables full of trash and my water had stuff floating in it. When I asked for a new one she told me she will give me one of her glasses because they come out dirty from the back, didn't make me feel good about the food I ordered. I ordered a steak that took forever. The food was cooked correctly. Nothing special but after all it is a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5?start=20,,,,,
23,Kristen C.,"Lebanon, OH",0,32,,5.0,2015-07-20,"I sat at the bar for dinner here on a Monday night at about 5 pm and the service was exceptional.  Tammy the bartender was fantastic,  she kept a very clean environment- even rewashing glasses that weren't perfect without being asked to, but just because it needed to be done.   I didn't have to ask for a thing.  I haven't had the greatest service in the past at various applebees restaurants but this one was great tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5?start=20,,,,,
25,Katie D.,"Mason, OH",1,7,,1.0,2015-09-12,Normally we love Applebee's but this time was very different. First off we got to our table and it was very sticky. We got our food and it wasn't very good at all. I got the chicken fajita roll-ups and it was lukewarm when they brought it out. My husband ordered some shrimp-noodle thing and his shrimp and vegetables on one side were burnt and the other side was not cooked. And his noodles were soaked in butter. We ordered our son the pizza bread and it was more sauce and cheese and just clumped together. And the mini cheeseburger we ordered for our daughter was also burnt on one side. The waiter took our order and got our drinks....he never asked if everything was ok. My husband talked to the manager but he said he was too busy for him at that time so he had a few minutes with him. My husband even asked the waiter if he would eat what he was and he said No. We will not be going back to that location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5?start=20,,,,,

8,Emily R.,"Cincinnati, OH",68,90,1574.0,2.0,2016-02-24,"I've become ever more disappointed in this Applebee's chain restaurant. I used to love Applebee's, before I knew about my food sensitivities/allergies, now that I struggle with what to eat that won't make me feel sick or give me inflammation or headaches, the less I'm able to enjoy eating out at places like this. Applebee's has made some significant improvements, as of late, in their decor and menu presentation, but they need to spend more time and effort on what their core business is; creating meals and experiences that you want to keep coming back for. I don't feel like my input is welcomed and when about food alternatives, the manager brings me a huge 3 ring binder filled with an extremely comprehensive list of every item on the menu and each allergen marked with a black X. It's like a subtle form of discrimination against people with different dietary needs. I couldn't even begin to read through the list and opted to photograph as many pages as I could before the waiter returned. When I submitted my complaint to the manager she said I needed to complain to corporate myself, that others also complain and implied that corporate doesn't do anything to positively impact the situation. Even ordering food I thought would be""safe"" for me to eat has made me feel sick afterwards. Salmon is always overcooked, they don't even bother asking how I want it cooked. I can't get grilled cod fish, as it comes pre-breaded. Out of all their salad dressings only 4 are dairy free, and they don't provide any olive oil. They use vegetable oil to cook with, and probably cross-contaminate everything. On more than a few occasions the edge of my plate was filled with very noticeable finger prints, around the entire plate. I don't think the company cares very much about customer's needs anymore. They are just too focused on their image and they are neglecting the parts of the business that will make or break them. I suggest offering a section that is Made to Order and offer a variety of suitable substitutions for your main body of dishes. Instead of adhering to your distasteful food environment that pushes away a huge subset of people with different dietary needs, accept and adopt simpler solutions that invite more people to eat at your establishments. Stop pretending like you care and actually do it. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5,,,,,
18,Aaron H.,"Lebanon, OH",4,76,8.0,2.0,2016-03-07,"I remember when Applebee's was a great place to eat.  Unfortunately, not this time.   Our service was exceptional, so this review's silver lining is our server.  She was attentive to our party of 6, and she placed all orders correctly.  Unfortunately, the kitchen got ahold of our orders after the waitress did.  If there was a way to mess something up, they found it.  My wife ordered the mashed potatoes she loves so much.  They had too much time on the plate before arriving to the table, so they were very cold.  My father in law ordered the steak with a pink center. It arrived well-done.  He sent it back, and another arrived well-done (They did give him a complimentary upgrade, so he now had 9 ounces of well-done steak, instead of just 8 on the previous attempt).  By this time, everyone had pretty much finished their meals, so he just told them to forget it and the manager had it removed from their tab.  He offered an almost sincere apology, and he did offer a comp entree to go, but it seemed he was pretty good at this particular speech and just wanted to get through it.  I wanted to pay with cash, but their ridiculous remote control ""tabletop assistants"" have no way to accept cash, and by this time everyone had disappeared, so we were forced to put it on debit.  There are too many restaurants to choose from in this area, so we'll not be back to this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5,,,,,
13,Sarah D.,"Loveland, OH",41,4,,1.0,2016-04-03,"Don't come here hungry. You will be full blown HANGRY by the time you get your food. My family and I spent over an hour and a half here today at lunchtime. I don't know if service is typically that slow or if they were understaffed but it took a brutally long time to even get our appetizer. And then long after we had finished our (mediocre) appetizer we were told by our server 3 separate times that our food was on the way out, but still we waited quite a while. If you don't mind waiting an unreasonable amount of time to eat and enjoy just ""OK"" food, this is your place! However, if you would like good food in a timely manner, there are much better places around Applebee's. Wish we would've gone elsewhere! On another note, if you have a baby that you want to bring into the restaurant in their car seat, your only options are putting them in the booth with you or setting them on the floor. They don't have slings. Get with the times Applebee's. Every other restaurant we frequent has slings.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mason-5,,,,,

11,Holly S.,"Kings Mills, OH",0,6,,1.0,2016-10-02,"This place just keeps getting worse. Servers are friendly people, but disorganized. We sat for 10 minutes and were about to stand up to walk out before someone greeted us. Our order was a salad, a wrap, and 2 kids meals. (Nothing that needed a lot of cooking time). We got our items 50 minutes later. Well...The kids meals, that is. And the kids were 2/3 of the way done before the salad and wrap came out. Once delivered, the server never returned to our table again to check in or over drink refills.

The front entrance was somewhat dirty, the hostess comes over and a very disheveled ponytail and hoodie. It wasn't that cold to want a hoodie. We got seated at a booth, and waited close to 10 minutes for our server. While he smiled, his demeanor was condescending. It's one of those ""you get what you pay for"" regarding the food quality.

If you are staying at one of the various hotels in the area, save yourself the sorry and go elsewhere.  Applebee's used to be the place to be but unfortunately they have declined greatly. This place is now for the sad and lonely hearted and people who have a gift card like me.  I tried to pay it safe with boneless wings and salad. Salad was overdressed and so were the wings not to mention one of my chicken wings was RAW inside!!! If you do have to come here and use GC, get a beer and drown your sorrows.
