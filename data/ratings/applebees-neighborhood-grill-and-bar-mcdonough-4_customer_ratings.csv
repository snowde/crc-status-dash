9,Karen P.,"McDonough, GA",17,31,55.0,1.0,2012-12-02,Never again will I come to this location. I had a cousin come from Cuba with an ID and just because they couldn't recognize it they did not allow him to buy a drink. The man is 68 years old and even the manager Nolan said that it would cost him his job. Even though his ID clearly stated his date of birth in 1944. These people will never as long as I live come to visit this place again. If you are a tourist -- don't ever come to this place because you will get discriminated against! You are NOT welcomed here. I promise that this will not end here. I will put this to the governors office and to the Better Business bureau for pure 100% discrimination. Thank you Applebee's for showing your true colors that only spell one color which is white!

Their new menu is great, and our server, Lexie, was exceptional. I recommend the turkey avocado sandwich on soft cibatta bread, as well as the new honey pepper shrimp and chicken. Nice size entrees that were cooked and prepared perfectly. A nice touch was a to-go drink made without having to ask.

28,Heather L.,"McDonough, GA",0,25,8.0,1.0,2014-11-07,"WOW, the menu looked so good, but I wanted a steak and I knew it. Ordered a medium sirloin with a portobello mushroom and red potatoes. First off, my potatoes were not red, they were regular ol' potatoes. Secondly, the WHOLE plate looked about half the size of what was pictured. literally, my ""stuffed portobello"" was a PIECE of a portobello, not a whole one. My steak was bouncy chewy, as if it had been microwaved, in addition, the potato felt microwaved as well.  In addition to all this, the manager proceeded to tell me that ""sirloins are the worst cut of steak, but sorry that's what applebees sells here.""  UM NO. I can make a MEAN sirloin on my own grill!!!! I am the griller of the house for a family of 5, and a sirloin is a decent cut; not the best, not the worst; but if done right, fits the BILL!  The manager. (outside of making excuses for the poor food I was served,) was at least kind and understanding and handed me a $5 coupon (which I won't be using...) and took the meal off the ticket. He also offered me something else, which I kindly refused, as I didn't want the cook to hand me spit-on fried shrimp.... Thanks, but NO THANKS!!!!

The service was beyond awful. When I first came in there was no one to lead me to my table even though the restaurant was practically empty. The food took forever to come out of the kitchen and when it did it wasn't hot at all. It wasn't even warm! It was room temperature. The fries were the only things they didn't mess up on, but the amount of salt and seasoning on it made it inedible. My quesadilla burger was cold and had pinkish spots while my brother's ribs were hard and possibly over cooked. Instead of good juicy ""fall-off the bone"" baby back ribs it had to basically be torn apart making a 'crunch' sound. It was disgusting to say the least so this is going to be my last visit.

8,Shelby S.,"Locust Grove, GA",1,13,,2.0,2015-07-04,"My family loves Applebee's and only recently started visiting this location again. I was disappointed with our service. Big time. We were seated for nearly ten minutes before we got our drinks. We ordered pretty quickly, yet it took nearly an hour for our food to come out. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as it has been - or as good as other locations are. As we were eating, an employee was dusting the air vents in the ceiling. Even the vents over people's heads who were eating! I'm sure this is something that could wait until closing or could be done before it opens. After we ate we asked for to go boxes, and our waitress tries to takes full plates of food off the table. Pretty sure that those to go boxes were for that leftover food you're trying to take, but thanks. We had to actually ask for our ticket because filled to go boxes, empty plates, and half of our party going outside wasn't a big enough clue that we were done and wanted to leave. It took well over ten minutes for her to run our card for us to pay. Did I mention that they weren't even busy while we were there? Or that our waitress told us she was bored? Or that our waitress walked up telling us she was sick?! No manager greeted us or stopped by to ask how things were. I would've had lots to say.

Waitress and hostess were nice, and that's the last good parts. Crosscut rib appetizers were drenched in so much BBQ sauce that I could not taste the meat. The riblets platter I ordered was rang up as a crosscut rib platter, why because its actually the same thing. So no longer do they have the actual riblets platter.

Applebee's is more known for being the place that's open late in the neighborhood to drink at. The happy hour drinks are always two for one. The appetizers are half off during happy hour as well.

At 9:05 I called because I never received an email confirmation from the restaurant and wanted to make sure my order went through. I called, they confirmed they received my order, and I asked about the status of the order. Mid-sentence I was rudely told ""it's cooking."" I waited until 9:31 before calling again. This time I was told ""well come inside, I have about 10 to-go orders sitting out."" I go inside the restaurant, they bring my food and I ask to speak to the manager. I'm at the point of tears because I'm frustrated. The manager nonchalantly explains that this happens all the time with online orders and says she's sorry. She doesn't offer anything to accommodate my wait time or anything. Another customer next me said he waited an hour for his to-go order as well. His food was cold, so he asked to speak to manager. I waited with him. All of a sudden the manager could not be found. He waited another 10 minutes. After listening to the manager nonchalantly address his concern too, I walked out feeling defeated.
