9,Angela E.,"McHenry, IL",34,4,,1.0,2012-08-18,"Just pretty bad. About a year ago we went here, we got the waitress who must have been a local celebrity because she chatted with everyone. But us. She took our order and she was gone. Saw her again when she brought us the bill. I just wanted to leave but it took her 20 MINUTES to take my boyfriend's card. She was too busy chatting with the next table over. Tonight we tried going here again. I was told if I ordered a special beer or margarita I could get free chips and salsa. I ordered a pomegranate martini and she hmmed and hawed because it wasnt on the list of ""specials"". But she said ""yea I think we can do that"". They brought me a margarita from the special menu instead of what I asked for but I didn't get any chips or salsa plus the drink was full price! She was attentive to every table but ours till we got the bill. The other waitresses weren't very personable either. I guess that's why they work at Applebees though. My boyfriend and I made a pact to never go back, no matter how desperate we are for a cheap date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mchenry-3?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

11,Jaelene P.,"McHenry, IL",0,2,,1.0,2012-12-08,"My boyfriend and I were having a date night tonight, and we were going to go to Chili's but they were packed. We saw the Applebee's and I realized I haven't been there in ten or so years. Now I know why. We sat at the bar where there were two people working; Brandon and Victoria I think. If you sit at the bar, ask for Brandon as he was the ONLY one doing their job. Victoria on the other hand messed up my drink.(Which was Sierra Mist.)after I told her twice I didn't want Pepsi. After giving us our drinks she walked away, so Brandon got me a new drink with no attitude or problem. About twenty to thirty minutes later Victoria comes back and takes our order with anything but a smile and nice attitude. She prints out our recipt(goodbye dessert!)and walks away again, even though my boyfriend and I needed refills. The entire night she was telling Brandon to make the drinks as she texted, checked her Facebook, and gossiped with all the other waitresses standing around. Finally someone brought the food, and for a seven dollar burger you'd expect some sustenance, not a flimsy burger, three pickle slices, and cold fries that taste like Burger King. The entire time we ate every time Victoria looked at us she did so with a dirty look. Maybe it's a new age thing where you treat customers with utmost disrespect, or maybe she had a bad night, but typically you don't treat customers as rude as she did. Brandon on the other hand was so nice and was doing basically all the work that needed to be done. If, for some reason you have lost your mind and decide to go here at least ask for brandon. I wonder if Victoria ever thought that if she were nicer and did her job without complaining in front of customers she would get more than a $2.50 tip which was left out of pity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mchenry-3?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
2,Simone C.,"Chicago, IL",0,27,20.0,5.0,2013-07-12,"I have eaten here probably four times when visiting family in the area.  The food has always been very good--well served and presented.  The drinks are generous, well-poured and properly served.  Staff has always been attentive, knowledgable and friendly, without being intrusive.  The place is spotless and welcoming, too.  I have never had a long wait for service or refills.   Recently, I left behind a beloved jacket.  Most places (chains especially) would have stood on that ""Not Responsible for Personal Property"" mantra but the staff went above and beyond the call of duty in order to get it back to me.  Kudos to this Applebees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mchenry-3?start=20,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1,2.1
32,Ger A.,"Barrington, IL",123,497,93.0,3.0,2013-07-29,"I know FRANCHISE, but the Dundee Palatine location was GOOD, & this is now the closest Applebees to us (30 miles!) after some kind of reorg & sale and closing of a lot of NW and Western Illinois Applebees (tax & lease losers). I think at least eleven closed and I just FINALLY got the Palatine Applebees flagged CLOSED and off the open Yelp intertubes but you best call first because Yelp is really slow at Flagging closed busynesses imo. Maybe YELP likes to pump up their numbers like some elites? I like to take my reviews DOWN when the busyness closes. Very close to the intersection of Route 31 & and 120 In McHenry. HUGE parking lot and looks like all the other Applebees, a little bit like the old Cheers Bar. Lotta wood, and dimly lit. I strongly recommend either coming early or late at either lunch or dinner because the peaks can overwhelm the staff. We like to go late for dinner and, bonus, appetizers are half price during the week after 9pm, and after 10pm on weekends. I like their 2 meals for $20 that includes an appetizer, and I tend to stick meat and potatoes here, like a burger or one of the small sirloin steaks. The boneless chicken wings are a good appetizer and the Oriental Chicken salad is pretty good. They have some under 550 calorie meals and they are better than you might expect; there are dinner specials every day. They try hard to accomodate any diet preferences you might have, and they can always back off on the salt shaker imo. They have a pretty lively bar, and drink specials every night so this is a good place to remember for that solo dinner with a lot of big screen tvs when that special someone is out of town. The bartenders can take your order, serve you, get drinks AND pretend to listen to your story. Try it.

18,Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",384,943,2285.0,3.0,2014-04-05,"So, options for ""good"" food in McHenry is pretty limited.  That said, my mom had received an Applebee's gift card and wanted to treat me to lunch last Saturday, so who am I to decline? Similiar to TGI Friday's, it's difficult to find NON-chicken or beef options on the menu.  The only seafood options I located on the menu were a Shrimp Pasta, a Fish and Chips basket, and Grilled Cheese. I had the latter, which also came with a small cup of tomato soup.  My mom had the Bleu Burger. In all, it was alright.  I think I expected more flavor since they boasted a trio of different cheeses, but found nothing notable as far as grilled cheese goes.  My mom enjoyed her burger.  Despite the place being relatively empty, the service, overall, was kind of poor.  Our server did pass us several times to attend to his other tables, so it did make it easier to flag him down for refills or to ask a question.  He was also nice about getting me change (since we didn't realize Mom had so much money on the gift card and it covered the entire meal). In all, if I had to go to a chain, I'd prefer to go to Panera across the street, where the have some healthier and less-heavy options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mchenry-3,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804

26,Glen D.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,2.0,1.0,2014-12-07,I would also like to add that a person at applebees corporate contacted me. They said they will resolve the issue with gift cards and pleaded to me to give them another shot.  Also giving the excuse for the server not knowing the menu saying this was a new item I had ordered. It was the wrong item delivered............................... She had sent me a 25$ coupon coupon with proof of purchase attached to it. Well I apologize but why would I ever go to your establishment after my last experience? It does not make any sense unless it was free.  And the coupon does not include alcohol. I would have to drink to deal with applebees again.  So to review I had complained about my worst experience ever at a restaurant. Applebees corporate counters with a 25$ coupon with purchase.   So the big corporate company does not care about the small town customers. Or listen or take care of the issues plaguing this terrible awful company period.  Your neighborhood grill- I dont care about your neighborhood period.  Reviewer- telling hundreds of people how awful you are. By hundreds I mean the 1k plus people on my social network.

Menu had a quite a few two-of-this-and-two-of-that-and-one-of-this combinations ... OK, nobody told me there'd be math, but the options were actually quite useful. Went with two lunch specials. And, now I know. Lunch special means small portions. I mean ... NORMAL portions. Gosh, I am way too spoiled by serving platter sized portions, aren't I? The soup was a normal soup bowl, the three cheese penne pasta was a ""side"" portion, my friend's sandwich was half of one (though plenty big enough to tell the truth). We arrived early for lunch and the soup wasn't particularly hot - was this reheated from last night? Probably. Kind'a tasted like it. Boo! The pasta was very good (if only I'd had a full serving!), my friend's sandwich looked very good (though the 'flavored' mayo took her by surprise - she's not a menu fine print reader, I guess).

Ended the meal with a $2.49 brownie bite: a small wedge of brownie topped with walnuts and served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Perfect size.

With that, the menu immediately began to change with our favorite appetizer being one of the first to go. When that happened, we stopped eating there as often going only once or twice a year. Over the years, the menu has steadily declined with favorite dishes being replaced or changed.

Although the location was relatively slow, the service was prompt and friendly. We tried the wings (boneless and bone-in), pretzel sticks, some kind of wanton appetizer, and mozzarella sticks. We both enjoyed the wings - cooked well, crunchy but not overdone. The mustard with the pretzels was outstanding, but the beer cheese tasted (and had the consistency) of a thin soup. The mozzarella wedges were not particularly flavorful.  After drinking water, our overall bill for 2 was $25.
