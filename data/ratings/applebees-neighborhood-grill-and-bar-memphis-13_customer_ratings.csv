8,Shae G.,"Biloxi, MS",0,15,,5.0,2012-02-01,"the food an service was delicious. And the waiter that served me was a joy to have, i think his name was, Tobarus, i've never been so attended to and taken care as much as he did. Best waiter i've ever had in Memphis. The portions will definitely have u wanting to stay in just fall into a beautiful sleep.

4,William P.,"Millington, TN",125,201,1116.0,2.0,2012-04-14,I have been to this place a few time with my parents and either you get decent service or really sh*** service. I like their food but how does it take 45 minutes when they're slow and the place is either doesn't care about the food nor their guests that pay hard earn money to go out..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13?start=20,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

The times I have gone, the service is always good, which is awesome because we usually take our kids with us. The wait for a table is never long, eventhough we are always 7 or 8 of us.The food is good not great but still satisfies. The steak is always cooked right, the fish and chips never disappoints. My daughter always orders mac n cheese, it's her favorite. It is not too noisy and they always have food and drink specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13?start=20,,,,,
5,Nina R.,"Memphis, TN",7,1,4.0,1.0,2013-04-13,I usually like Applebee's... I normally go to the one Union ave. But I was with family and they chose to go to this.. When we first got there we stood at the door for 5 minutes.. Then the manager walks over got application and acted like he didn't even see us.. We got his attention and asked was we ever going to be seated.. He turned to us and said give me just a second and I'll go get someone to seat you.. That took a additional three minutes.. After we was seated we watch the door and noticed that they did it several times again... Looking around we noticed that the managers and other coworkers were standing around playing... I'm not sure if this happens often but it wasn't a very pleasant experience the server was great the other coworkers Not so much!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13?start=20,,,,,
27,Chris L.,"Cordova, TN",7,65,,1.0,2013-06-11,"Went here twice in one week and both times the service was terrible. On the first occasion, we ordered sliders and they came completely plain, no sauce or onions and the bread was not toasted like it normally is, it was cold and stale and so dry that I almost choked trying to swallow it. I asked the server if they changed the sliders because they are normally completely different and quite tasty and she said no. I pulled the bun off to show her how they looked and she laughed and said they forgot the other stuff so she brought out a bowl of sauce and onions and walked off. No ""sorry about that"" or anything.  My mother ordered unsweetened ice tea and there is no sweetener on the table so I flagged down the server and asked if we could get some sweet-n-low. 10 minutes later I went digging around the bar to find some. We never got drink refills either. The only napkin we had was the one wrapped around the silverware and we had messy food. This was 3pm in the afternoon, hardly a mad rush on a weekday. The server just seemed lazy and annoyed the whole time.  Went back two days later (assuming the bad service was just a fluke) and had a different server. I ordered a sandwich and fries. I discovered the ketchup bottle on the table was empty and my server was busy chatting with other employees so I got up to locate a bottle of ketchup. When I started eating the sandwich I realized it was very messy and I had sauce all over me. I was craning and looking all around for my server and could not spot her. Other servers would look away knowing full well I needed something. So, I got up and found extra napkins (which were next to a group of employees visiting with each other).  I polished off my drink mid-sandwich and needed a refill. Same thing, looking around for SOMEONE and everyone looked away because they could tell I needed something. So, I got up and walked to the kitchen to ask for a drink refill. My server came out and I asked her for a refill and she took my glass and disappeared for at least 5 minutes...it was an abnormally long time to refill a fountain drink. No ""oh I'm sorry"" or anything. I finish up my meal and needed to leave but of course, no check. I start the whole process again with all of the employees pretending to not notice I needed something. I got up and went to the register and told the group of employees who were still visiting with each other if I could get my check. This was at 2:30pm in the afternoon and there were maybe 5 tables in the whole restaurant. They treated me as if I was interrupting their break time. I enjoy Applebee's food when they prepare it correctly, but the service at this location is so bad we have decided we will drive to another part of town WAY out of our way if we get a hankering for some Asian tacos or something. Because service this bad just ruins the entire meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
23,Tina J.,"Memphis, TN",51,79,91.0,2.0,2013-12-23,The waiter was good but food took forever to come n my friend kid's food didn't come till later when almost everybody was done!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
28,Amber M.,"Memphis, TN",79,210,34.0,1.0,2014-05-21,"The service. I have a 15 month old daughter. She is not a booster seat child, yet. I mean, she can, but she is wriggly and it's much easier to strap her into a high chair.  Our server refused to give me a highchair, stating that they can't put them in the aisle. They then refused to move us to a place where you can put a highchair and insisted I use a booster.  Welllll.... the boosers straps were ripped off, and they wouldn't get me a new one. So I'm fighting with a fidgety, exploratory child and we order our food with barely a glance at the menu, in and out, right? Wrong. The food took FOREVER. When it finally did come out, the kids meal didn't. When THAT finally came out, we were finished and it was way too hot for her to touch. When she finally did get to eat, it took another 30 minutes to get a check and another 15 for her to pick it back up.  Why didn't I leave? I don't know... I was with my mom and sister, and we were there, and the baby was in, it was just a dumb decision. I hate terrible customer service, and this was a total of three people that were extremely unhelpful.  This was a weekday at 3pm, there were TWO other tables. No excuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,

18,Ramona P.,"Memphis, TN",702,181,1034.0,3.0,2015-04-23,"This location is okay. I have been a couple of times, and the service is about the same. You generally have to ask for basic service. You have to go on a man hunt looking for your waiter/waitress (happens every time I've gone). My waitress did not give me any napkins, and I had to hunt her down to ask her for some. The food was great! I had the American standard burger, which was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
26,Darrell S.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,2015-05-08,One of the dirtiest  restaurants I have ever been in.  The table had to be wiped After we sat down. Then we were given napkins to dry the table. The floor was filthy. They wanted to sweep but I said not while I am eating. The chicken tender basket is joke. 3 scrawny pieces of chicken and a few fries. It all tasted like microwave food. The only thing that was good was the Jack Daniels. The waitresses  was very nice to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
19,Schneidogg ..,"Memphis, TN",0,61,7.0,1.0,2015-09-13,"Not worth it.  I had the unlimited soup and salad (I know, that was probably a risk). The two soups, clam chowder and loaded potato, were both very salty. The dressing was not very good. My wife's chicken tenders were not good either.  The price wasn't overbearing, but we left very ""unsatisfied.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
13,Chase P.,"Memphis, TN",10,48,11.0,3.0,2015-10-21,"There are many things that highlight and justify this review for Applebee's. This place has everything chillis has, pretty much. It would be cool if they added another type of steak, because I'm getting tired of sirloin and ribeye.  Let's get this review on Seating Was pretty quick, and the booths were pretty nice. I enjoyed some of the music they played, but it was really quiet, and the restaurant was quiet, too. Service The waitress was pretty nice, and she got our food in a considerable amount of time. It wasn't fast, but not hair-pulling-out slow.  Food and drink. Not too good, but not bad. My steak was the best thing, and the drinks were filled up pretty good.1 All in all, three stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
21,Michael S.,"Memphis, TN",41,59,60.0,3.0,2015-10-29,"I give Applebee's between 2 and 4 stars. It really depends on the server. My server was below standards. But when you see those tabletop order devices, you know they know that already. I was seated and ordered my appetizer on the device before the server got to my table to ask what I wanted to drink. Really, she may as well have been a robot - no smile, scripted questions, I'm just another person between her and time to go home. I always get the steak and whole grains. The potstickers bar snack is awesome. You get plenty of them. Pour the sauce over the lettuce and enjoy it as a salad while you wait. A couple of customers were seated in the booth next to me while I waited. Again, no smile from her. I really feel like we are all just in her way. She did take my glass to refill it but she took it just as I was about to have that last drink that I needed and brought it back without my straw or a new one and didn't waste any time asking if I needed anything else. Ugh! A guy name Diamanté waited on me a few times here. He made me want to come back - small talk if nothing else but at least he showed a bit of personality.  At this point, I just don't want to come back. I feel off out of the way and neglected. Maybe something will happen to brighten these people's day. Note to potential servers: If a group of two or more come in, be hospitable and get out of their way; they aren't there to socialize with you. But if a single comes in, be open showing a but of personality and play it by ear. He may be there to study or do business and not want to be bothered but then he may be someone whose day you could brighten or someone who could brighten your day. I've waited tables. I know your feet hurt. I'm the guy who makes it worth your while to use your head and be what I'm in the mood for. If you can't smile, can't treat a customer like a guest at your personal dinner table, you really shouldn't be waiting tables. You'll hurt the restaurant and yourself in the long run. This dreary experience will make me question whether I'm really in the mood for it next time I consider coming to Applebee's. Last thing on this experience. The server had one other table and me. As I ate the appetizer, my meal and the dessert, she visited my table twice to refill my drink, I got a straw from another server since mine was invisible for 10 minutes at a time, and she never picked dishes and prebussed the table. I leave with empty dishes on the table - the food was obviously good. But as sure as those empty dishes evidence that, they evidence lack of attention from the server. I've attached pics. Good luck if you come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
22,Justin R.,"LAKE CORMORANT, MS",11,4,,1.0,2015-11-26,"So after wanting Applebee's for a few days we decided to embark on the journey to the crappiest place ever.  We sat down and waited 15 minutes to place our drink order.  We went ahead and ordered our food while ordering drinks to make it quicker.  Margaritas arrived and they were complete crap.  So we decided to leave at that point and will not return.  It is sad how this once was the busiest restaurant in Bartlett and was busy all the time, what it has become is shameful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
0,Jason H.,"Houston, TX",0,22,,1.0,2015-12-30,"So I don't have a lot to go by on this review, but was pretty underwhelmed by what I saw.  Walked right in and was seated, then waited 10 minutes after pressing the 'call server' button and no one came to help.  There were plenty of servers, particularly since the place was only half full, yet none of them seemed to be in a particular hurry.  Maybe their table ordering technology is broke, or maybe they don't like us, but I'm not going back.  If you find yourself in this Applebee's wondering where the hell your server is, do yourself a favor and get up, leave, and go to Dixie Cafe across the street where the service is lightening fast and the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13?start=20,,,,,

20,Megan P.,"Horn Lake, MS",9,10,2.0,1.0,2016-08-20,"This place is t even deserving of ONE star! I normally do NOT blast businesses, if I can help it. No greeting upon entering, with FOUR employees standing at the hostess booth. Then, talked about cleaning tables. My husband had to comment that we were looking for seating for two. That was met with, ""Oh two?"".......umm, yes. After being taken to our table, stepping over a spilled drink on the floor, we try to order. Waiter doesn't know anything about tall beer glasses (Blue Moon). Get our food and finish eating. Wait 30 minutes - and alert wait staff via electronic table pad for our waiter's assistance. This is getting ridiculous! After we finally get our receipt, we ask about military discount. He has to ask his manager.....we wait another 15 minutes. No military discount. We leave with no thank you for coming in's on our way out the door. Just absolutely irritating! We WILL NOT be coming back ever again!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
16,Witch E P.,"Memphis, TN",0,34,,1.0,2016-08-23,"Three Strikes and you're out!!  You're Out Applebees!!! A few weeks ago, my daughter and I decided to go to Applebee's for lunch.  I generally do not eat in. I get take out.  But my daughter came over and we decided on a girl's lunch out.  Our ""server"" never once came to our table.  She did pass us by once and said ""I'll be right with you."" When she didnt show up in 15 minutes and continued to pass us by, I flagged down another server and asked her to take our order.  She took our order, served our drinks.  Our so called ""server"" was busy with a table of 5. She seemed to only be ""serving"" that table. Our glasses became empty, time passed with no food, I flagged down the another server, and requested refills.  She apologized for our ""server"" and said she was busy with a party.  A party is 5 people?  I waited tables in my teens as a good many do as a right of passage, a table of 5 is NOT a party. It's a table of 5.  Time goes on, and our glasses are empty again and no food. I ask for the manager.  The manager again apologizes and tries to tell me that our ""server"" is busy with a party. I roll my eyes. The manager serves our food, which is ice cold by now. Yes, once again, I ask for the manager-who did not bother to stick around to see if everything was ok.  Now I could almost forgive this if it was a full restaurant at a busy time of day-but this was about 2pm and there were the table of 5, my table of us 2, and two more tables with 2 each. The manager offers to send our food back and ""warm"", I tell her no thank you, just take it off our bill and we will leave. She comps the drinks. Fast forward til today, I havent been back or ordered since the above happened. I called in to place an order at 3pm and some guy answers the phone ""thank you for calling Applebee's Shalom aleikhem, how may I help you?"" I found that greeting to be totally inappropriate.  But nonetheless I announced I needed to place an order for pick up. The guy told me, ""We are kinda busy right now, call back later."" and hung up on me. Not kidding.  I thought about it later, and began wondering if he really said what I thought he said, or did we just get disconnected? So about 8:50pm tonight I called in and a woman answered the phone. I told her I wanted to place an order for pickup.  She asked me to hold.  She came back to the phone 2 minutes later and said ""we dont take pick up orders after 9pm.""  Of course, I replied, ""it is not 9pm yet.""  she told me to ""hold on.""  I am guessing to wait out the time until it really was 9pm, but then the same guy who ""Shalom aleikhem"" me earlier got on the phone.  How do I know? He Shalom aleikhem me again..lol..I told him I would like to place an order for pick up and he hung up on me again.  I called back and asked to speak to the manager, Shalom aleikhem dude got on the phone, trying to disguise his voice, telling me his name was MiMing and snickering, prior to hanging up. So that is strike 3 Applebee's. You obviously do not need my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-13,,,,,
14,Timothy R.,"Memphis, TN",5,18,,5.0,2016-11-20,"I rarely review chain restaurants because, they're generally mediocre and generic, but after tonight's experience I had to review this location as it was among the most exceptional service I've ever had at any restaurant. The jewel of the location's name is Hunter, the bartender, a member of the staff for about 10 years according to him. Incredibly responsive, yet NOT intrusive as wait staff usually are at chains. Addressed every concern with actions above and beyond expectations. Truly amazing service throughout the SNF game - able to generate this review in spite of my team's miserable play that should otherwise have brought the evening down. I'm sure most reviews for this location are bad because nobody bothers with a positive review of a chain (myself included) - so when I tell you we had a great experience, I truly mean it.

I am very happy to say I had my first good experience there on Monday 4-17-17. Our server was a younger man with dreads and I wish I would have caught his name. He was fabulous! He was friendly and prompt. All around his service was on par with the type of service we get at far nicer places.
