26,Erica B.,"Highland, IN",441,522,649.0,2.0,2012-01-18,"Oh Applebee's what is going on at this location?  I'm not a fan of chains, and really not a big fan of Applebee's.  Aside from their Weight Watchers menu (which is just a genius move on their part) I've never really climbed on board.  However, pregnancy will make you crave ridiculous things.  Cue the Oriental Chicken Salad here.  Come hell or high water, there have been a handful of times I have had to get my mouth around this incredibly lame, yet delicious salad.   We've made the mistake of dining here on all occasions but one.  Aside from the fabulously wonderful host at the host stand (no seriously- this guy takes the cake and the pan it was baked in.  Give him a raise) all the experiences left a lot to be desired.  Whether it is busy or dead you will wait forever for any sort of service once seated at your table.  Both our orders were wrong on 3 different occasions and the server argued with me when I tried to tell him that the Oriental salad didn't come with honey mustard dressing. Really??  You're going to argue with the pregnant lady who is craving a menu item you've had since you opened your doors in the 80s?  Honey mustard dressing on an Oriental salad?  Just a very unfriendly, yuck experience all around. The extra star is for curbside pick up to go.  On the last occasion where my craving for this salad surpassed any amount of reasoning, we opted to go for this option.  I wish I could rate it separately.  Service was great, food correct and they were extremely friendly.  My advice- if you're seriously craving the 'Bee, don't eat inside this location.  Get it to go and indulge in the privacy of your own home- for numerous reasons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-14?start=20,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

14,Jon M.,"Dallas, TX",5,25,1.0,1.0,2014-04-20,"I want to start off by saying that this Applebee's location is still open by the grace of some kind of supernatural force because I go to this location once a year for 7 years and nothing has changed.  First, I don't like Applebee's food at all so whenever I did go it is because I am with a group of people and majority rules so I always end up going along.  Second, the wait time is always long at this location and majority of the time it is for no reason. As I speak there are plenty of empty tables that they could feel instead of having us on a false wait and lie to us that it is only a 10 to 15 minute wait time. I don't believe there is even a host because it takes forever for someone to appear at the podium before they notice you are there and obviously the servers dont insist on doing the job themselves or notify someone of guest up front. Third, the food is bland and the alcoholic drinks are watered down. Instead of a server recommending what to get on the menu they just appear and disappear until you make your own decision or leave which they do not care if you do. As I have stated before the food is bland and it was lukewarm as usual. I tell my friends this all the time but they never listen!  Lastly, the dessert my friends had was a cookie skillet and a scoop of ice cream on it. The ice cream was runny and cookie was too firm and lukewarm yet again.  I don't know what people love about Applebee's or this location. I started to ask the workers do they need new hires because they are in desperate need of kitchen and front of the house help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-14,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003

31,Kay C.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,2014-12-05,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. It has been years since I visited this location, now I know why. I was there a few nights ago, to have a drink and an appetizer. I ordered a strawberry long island iced tea and chicken quesadilla. The service was crappy. I sat at the bar, which was filthy and not tended too, napkins and plates of leftovers were still sitting on the bar. The bartender cleaned the bar once we approached. Anyone that has ordered a long island iced tea, knows that you can taste some sort of liquor, this drink tasted like kool-aid, and you could see right through it, like water. I told the bartender, but she said they did not take drinks back. Okay, I let that go. I get my food order, and it was down right nasty, not appealing to the eye at all. I took one bite, and left the remainder on my plate. The bartender asked me what was wrong, and I told her I did not like it at all. About 30 minutes later the manager came over, and was just standing there in front of us, not saying a word. I asked him what he needed, he said did you ask for a manager, and I told him I did not, but since you are here, I can tell you about this food. He told me that because we were there during ""happy hour"" times, he could not remove the quesadilla's from my ticket. He did not offer to remake or replace them. I had not asked for him in the first place, but since he came over I asked. Anyway, I only spent $14 there and they will never get another dime from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-14?start=20,,,,,

20,Angela M.,"Oak Harbor, WA",42,52,17.0,2.0,2015-03-18,I went to this restaurant an hour and thirty minutes before they stopped serving food. Once my food came out it was warm. The server I had that night was nice but very forgetful. He said that he had been up all night so I won't hold that against him. He did apologize each time we had to remind him that we were waiting for him to bring our entree and appetizer or our beverages. It was not busy when we arrived at this location. So I do not understand why you have to wait so long for your food. This experience was not as worse as what I encountered at the location in Bartlett but I would suggest that the staff focus more on customer service and speed while ensuring that the food is cooked thoroughly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-memphis-14?start=20,,,,,

18,Tom M.,"Germantown, TN",0,4,,1.0,2015-09-25,"My Applebees experience was such a letdown. I try to go back to a restraurant I had a bad experience in to give them a second chance hoping things have changed. Bad move on my part! I first asked if I could get soup instead of fries with an upcharge on one of their new burgers and was told yes. I asked for my soup to come out first. Guess what? It came out the same time. When I reminded her of my request she said ""they sent them together"". Duh! Fries came with it which were cold and I said ""I didn't order fries because I got the soup instead"". She then said ""They're seperate, you can't get the soup instead of the fries"".If I had hair I'd pull it out!"" Manager took off the soup charge. By the way, the $10.49 burger was not worth it and the french onion soup was'nt that good either. I should have gone to Five Guys next door. Bye Applebees, we're done!

Unfortunately the service has gone way down and I refuse to give my money to an establishment that does not care about their customers. I was greeted by the hostess not by a hello or how are you this evening but rather her notifying me that there will be a gratuity added to my check. I guess I look like I'm not going to tip or Applebee's is punishing all of their customers because of the lack of tips left prior to me coming in to dine. As a former waitress and manager, the customer service was terrible. Gratuity is not required, however service charges are. Once I was seated by the hostess, the waitress came to my table and reminded me of the gratuity that was mandatory. I mean, can I order food? I would have tipped over the gratuity amount of 18% anyway but demanding the gratuity as if you have a crystal ball saying I'm a non tipper made me lose my appetite. So I'm assuming the waitress could sense an irritable customer and went and got her manager that I did request. The manager says so I hear you have a problem with the gratuity? Needless to say, I decided to take my money elsewhere. I will not be eating there ever again and will make sure my network and affiliates do not either.  Piss poor customer service at its finest!
