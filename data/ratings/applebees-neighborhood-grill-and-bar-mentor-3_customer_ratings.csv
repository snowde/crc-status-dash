9,Serena S.,"Mentor, OH",14,15,6.0,1.0,2014-08-27,"I don't normally eat out as I am fairly health conscious and most restaurants use horrible quality ingredients and too much salt buuuut I was feeling lazy and I'll be gone for a few days so I didn't want to go far or have food in my fridge going bad. I ordered food online from the Applebee's a few blocks away. I only wanted fish for some reason and didn't have a taste for anything else. The only fish they showed was blackened tilapia and salmon. I chose the tilapia because chain restaurants never get salmon correct. You can't screw up blacked tilapia right? I also added some garlic mashed potatoes with butter, sour cream and cheese. I know, not very healthy. It was about 6:50 when I ordered and said my food would be ready by 7:09. I left immediately and got there just before 7. I didn't wait long when 2 girls came out with my check. Thankfully I optioned to pay cash and not credit. I gave her a $20 and she said she would be back with my change. She was back shortly and said my food was still cooking and it would be a few minutes. I said OK. I have a toddler so I was trying to entertain him while we waited. A few minutes later she came back with a menu to tell me that they didn't have tilapia. Not that they ran out but that they just no longer had it on the menu. She asked if I wanted anything else. No apologies, no offer of a free item, nothing. Just handed me the menu and stood quietly while I flipped through. I said I didn't want anything else, that I specifically wanted the tilapia and handed her the menu back. She just look dumbfounded. The girl behind her asked if I still wanted the mashed potatoes and I said I guess so because they were for my son. And I said, ""So my food wasn't even cooking when you said it was."" She said no and that she went into the kitchen to ask if the tilapia was done and they said they don't do tilapia anymore. Still no apology or offer of compensation. They left and I waited for about 10 minutes for her to bring my change back. I had left a tip over 20% when I paid initially but she did not give that back. I told her anyways to keep the tip because I'd been a waitress before and I know how much the job sucks. But to assume after all the waiting for nothing but a small side of mashed potatoes she would just keep the tip, offer no apology and barely speak to me? Seriously? I chalk it up to her first day of training for her first job ever. She couldn't have been over 18 years old. By the way, the mashed potatoes were disgusting, I didn't get sour cream and as I stirred them I noticed remnants of green onion I never asked for. Ended up driving thru McDonalds. Yuck. Serves me right for trying a chain restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
8,Lauren B.,"Kirtland, OH",4,9,10.0,1.0,2014-12-11,"Staff just looked at us when we walked in. 4 of them including the manager was within talking distance of us and no one welcomed us. It looked like they were avoiding seating anyone. Took another 2 minutes for someone to walk over and seat us. Food was average. Boyfriend ordered the triple bacon burger and it seriously came with only two strips if bacon. Leaving, again staff were around but nobody acknowledged us let alone thanked us for coming. Manager was again one of them. Never going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
7,Cameron V.,"Painesville, OH",8,5,,5.0,2015-01-26,"A lot of people assume that all chain restaurant locations are more or less the same, but there is often a lot of variation between different locations. As far as Applebee's goes, the Mentor location is one of the best in my opinion. The food was good, the service was fast and polite, the restaurant was clean and inviting, and the price is right. It's everything you could ask for from a casual dining restaurant. No, it's not a super hip indie restaurant with certified fresh organic ingredients and trendy music piped in through the speakers. But of you've got twenty bucks in your pocket and you want to catch up with an old friend over a burger and a couple drinks, you could sure do a whole lot worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
5,anthony e.,"Mentor, OH",39,34,2.0,2.0,2016-04-06,"Courteous staff but confusing happy hour. I went online to see what cocktails were included and the price. They differed greatly from the website. The manager explained I must go to the franchises own website to see what's available. That's too much work, one price no matter the location. Won't be going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
6,Dave M.,"Mentor, OH",0,3,,4.0,2016-05-30,Have been here several times. Staff has been attentive and accommodating every time. Burgers were well cooked. The drinks wete very well made also. This is consistent even when the place is packed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
4,Katherine C.,"Painesville, OH",0,18,2.0,1.0,2016-06-16,"I normally have a 4 star time when I go there or order out but today my husband wanted to order out and I wasn't feeling it but I agreed I got the French onion soup(my favorite), garlic mashed potatoes, the boneless honey BBQ wings, and the double glazed ribs. My husband got something else, everything was good until I got to the ribs I ate the smaller end piece it was soo peppery not spicy peppery like they caked it with pepper... My lips have been tingling for 45 minutes and it made me so sick it was soo covered in pepper. The worst part is from what I could taste from the sauce it tasted watery and bland. I am sorry but this had to be shared I've never had something like this happen to me at a restaurant. I really hope this never happens again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
3,K K.,"Painesville, OH",0,12,,1.0,2017-03-13,"Our waiter told us if we ate everything off our plates, we'd get free cookies. At the end of our meal, he said I wouldn't get any because I chose not to eat a piece of lettuce that fell onto the table, which was built-up in layers of gross, sticky grime.  He again stated I'd need to eat the lettuce, if I wanted my free dessert. I asked if he was kidding, to which he answered ""NO"" in a rather snotty attitude. I said I wasn't going to eat the lettuce, because it was unsanitary and I didn't really want a flipping cookie anyway. And I mean, how often are those wash rags that they use to wipe the table actually cleaned?  No tip for him...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
2,Gina G.,"Cleveland, OH",561,465,232.0,1.0,2017-07-07,"We came here for dinner tonight to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service was horrible. The waitress disappeared numerous times and the food was mediocre at best. We had to ask for silverware, napkins and refills from other servers we had to flag down.  My meal was disappointing. The cedar salmon with maple mustard glaze doesn't actually come with spinach like the description and photo in the menu suggests. I was informed by the manager that it's merely a ""garnish"". So the 6 wilted leaves of spinach hiding under my over-cooked, fishy-tasting, most-likely previously frozen salmon weren't officially there as part of the meal. After commenting about it to the waitress, she looked at me with the ""what do you want me to do about it"" look. Â About 5 minutes later, she returned with an appetizer plate with about 10 steamed leaves of spinach on it. The broccoli was mushy and over cooked. The baked potato was simply that. I would have been embarrassed serving that plate to someone. My husband said his burger was ok. The spinach dip tasted ok, but the ramekin was half full and it looked like it had been sitting there for a while.  There is zero pride taken into the way things are plated or delivered. For an $82 check, I could have gone somewhere else for shitty food and crappy service. It was such a painful experience all around. We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
1,Samantha K.,"Mentor, OH",21,13,1.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"This place is trash  I'd rather eat McDonald's. Staff is rude Food is awful My daughters highchair was filthy, I asked for a new one and was told that was the only one.  I had to ask for a refill 4 times, never once did my waiter do it without being asked. Never was offered to go boxes or even got our check. We were expected to pay at the little tablet thing I assume.  Waste of $50",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
0,Jasmine C.,"Euclid, OH",1,9,1.0,5.0,2017-10-03,I have a long time relationship with Applebee's . Our waiter Christian was very pleasant and our food was hot and delicious. This is one of the best Applebee's in northern Ohio. I'm always satisfied when I come to this one. Please keep up the great customer service. Great food for a great value.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mentor-3,,,,,
