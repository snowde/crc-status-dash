58,Mark T.,"Chandler, AZ",409,574,963.0,2.0,2012-02-04,"Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10.  The hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink I finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables.  It wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10?start=20,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

63,Kimo K.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,241,45.0,2.0,2012-10-17,"This is the second Applebee's that I tried in the last year.  I went again to this one for a simple lunch with a friend, and we decided to try the 2 for $20 special again.  Once again, I was disappointed -- so I must remember to honor the old saying, ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me"".  We shared the one appetizer, and we selected the fried mozzarella sticks.  They were bad and hard.  My friend order the SW shrimp and pasta dish and that looked pretty bad (I did not get a chance to taste it).  I ordered the three cheese pasta and grilled chicken.  There was some cheese on the pasta -- I could taste it, but there was no sauce or liquid -- just dry, cooked pasta, that tasted cheesy.  And my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked.  The whole dish was disturbingly dry and bad!!   I know that what they show on their TV advertising and on their menus are ""doctored"" and ""made up"" dishes to make them ""show"" better for advertising purposes.  But what they actually serve is pretty bad and that is a travesty.   I think the other ""semi-fast food"" places like Olive Garden, Chili's, and Red Lobster, have better food.  And I think Applebee's would be better off (or perhaps their customers) if they provided small salads instead of the sickly ""one appetizer to share"" option.

I ordered the house special sirloin, medium rare, which is my usual order.  When the steak came (and it was the last of six plates out of the kitchen), the steak was vastly overdone - it was WELL done, and would have been inedible.  I asked the server to take it back, and by the time it came, everyone else had finished their meal---I don't believe that the kitchen put the right emphasis on replacing it.  When the second steak came, it was so full of gristle that I managed to get about 3 bites out of it...I left the rest of it on the plate.   This is truly the first time I've had a problem with Applebee's, and I've eaten in locations from Arizona to Tennessee and back.  I wasn't very impressed with this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10?start=40,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

The food is pretty good, service is typically great, prices are reasonable!  We like it well enough because it is right around the corner from us. We brought our son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters for dinner on a Saturday night. It was my grand daughter's 3rd birthday. Sadly, we were quite disappointed. When we arrived, it was early -  4:30pm - and there were only 2 other tables with customers. Quite empty, which we thought was good as we figured service would rock! Not so. While the server brought the mac 'n cheese out for the girls immediately, the rest of our meals took over 25 minutes to arrive. I had the salmon - it was overcooked and the vegetables were, well, awful. My daughter-in-law's combo appetizer plate was amazing - (grilled chicken wanton tacos-to DIE for!) but clearly her plate held up the rest of our meals. It was fresh and piping hot! All of ours were cold. We mentioned it to our server, the manger came to our table and apologized, took the salmon off our bill. Nice gesture but then the birthday sundae came to our table about 10 minutes AFTER my husband got his triple chocolate meltdown. Try explaining to a 3 year old why she had to wait for her ""birthday"" sundae! The servers sang the happy birthday thing and it was nice. THEN.......we waited over 15 minutes to get the bill. Finally, all of us except my husband left. He had ""words"" with the manager about the bill coming so late.

The arugula was soggy on the whole salad. She said she did not want the salad and asked the server to take it back and get something else instead(NOT salad). So all the while we were eating our food she sat there waiting for the waiter to return to order something else. By the time she finally returned to take her order we were bites away from being done. Disappointed because the time it took to get back to her she told the server never mind they are all ready finished with their lunches. The server said okay. When the manager came around he offered to order another salad which she did not want because of the first one. The manager in a joking manner said well I have been so busy sorry I was not there to watch all the food coming out and said the salad had been taken off our bill. I was very disappointed that he approached it that way. Of coarse the salad should not be on our bill she had to send it back because the arugula was no good. He was not doing us a favor be taking it off the bill. Going out to lunch is a treat and not something we get to do all the time.

I ended up having to cancel my dessert order & leave to pick up our children from school & drive BACK to the restaurant to get my husband since he chose to go ahead & wait for the food because he really likes the tomato basil, french onion & chicken tortilla soup (he also likes it at Chili's) and the oriental chicken salad as well as the fiesta chicken salad.  While I was gone he moved to a table in the bar area to see the ""game"" on TV & told me the bartender was friendly. However, I don't plan on going back here for a LOOONG time. Especially since today we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery on Superstition Springs & Power where they have all you can eat soup & salad for only $7.95 as opposed to the $9.99 price at Applebee's.  Thinking back I do remember having a problem at this location about 5 yrs. ago when we went for a family dinner with my parents & they sent us a gift card in the mail because of the problems we had then. I guess they haven't improved much in those years. :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10?start=40,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.8280000000000003,2.68

50,TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348.0,2.0,2015-10-10,"K and I had just dropped C off for rehearsal and because a storm was headed for the valley we decided to duck into Applebee's for the great Monday night burger deal. Our server was Candy and she was really very pleasant. She did a great job of being around when we needed her but was not suffocating. K and I both ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday only). We both loooooove this burger. It is my favorite burger from Applebee's. They sear bacon and onions into the patty and then top it with crispy hash browns, a fried egg, American cheese and ketchup (which I omit). K gets the burger with the ketchup and we both ordered it medium rare. Candy brought us our drinks and our burgers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered chips with mine and K had ordered fries with hers. Both burgers were a bit overcooked. Not enough to send them back, but enough to lessen the ooowee goooey goodness. On both the fried egg was also a bit overdone. I love this burger because I want to cut into or bite into the egg and have it ooze all over the hash browns but both these eggs were past the runny stage. Bummer. The funny thing is the hash browns could have been cooked a bit more. They need to be crispy. Not just because that's what's in the description, but because that's what works with this burger. However, since our eggs were not runny, it didn't really matter. The fries were also just o.k. Not done enough if you ask me. Fries by nature should be crispy. I'm not talking over fried but they have to have some tooth to the texture. These did not. The chips were ok. Nothing special. If the burger was cooked right, and the eggs were runny, and the hash browns were crispy and the fries were a bit more cooked I would give this visit a 4 Star because Candy was such a good server. But because the burgers were not I have to drop it to a 3 Star. Average. But... here's where this visit looses another star. These burgers are supposed to come with endless fries. When we asked Candy for another order, hoping that maybe the second order would be a bit crispier, she told us that the Monday night, $6.99 Any Burger Special did not come with endless fries.  Now, those who know me know I hate having to correct people when it comes to THEIR business. Both K and I knew that wasn't true so we asked her when the policy changed and Candy told us that one of the Manager's at this Applebee's told the employees that the $6.99 Monday burger deal did not come with endless fries. O.K. So I pulled up the Applebee's website and found the TV ad that showed free refills of fries with the $6.99 Burger. I showed the Ad to Candy and she went back to tell the manager. She came back with another order of fries and told us that ""this manager agrees with you"". In all of this, Candy was very pleasant and continued to apologize for how our experience was going. Agrees with me? It's on your f*&^#@# Television Ad. It's NOT my idea. I'm not making it up. Why don't the Managers know corporate policy and what's being advertised on TV? Wow. Great server, Average burger, crappy fries, manager without a clue. 2 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.024,2.72

After making a comment to the manager, we had a slight compensation for the evening. So, I decided last night, to give them one chance at redemption... worst decision! Not only were my boneless chicken wings cold, they tasted as if they were fried in old grease. To top it off, our spinach dip was very runny and also under cooked. The ""perfect margarita"" tasted as if it was made entirely of sweet and sour and the ""Bahama mama"" tasted chalky and gritty.

How can you serve cold food? Yes, food came out picture perfect, but not not good.

4,Justin F.,"Gilbert, AZ",6,71,313.0,5.0,2017-07-21,"We love Applebees for dinner. Lots of options available for meals and drinks. The food is always pretty well priced an the staff is pretty nice. The staff seems to changeover often at this location, not sure why, but that does bring a learning curve to the staff. Overall, highly recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Jane K.,"Gilbert, AZ",205,160,120.0,4.0,2017-07-23,"After reading the reviews, I realize that it all depends on who is serving, who is cooking and what you order.  We had two nice experiences here. Burgers on Monday are very good and inexpensive.  Most people were taking advantage of this special. Another special was 2 for $20 or 2 for $25.  We got the 2 for $25 and started with artichoke dip and chips. Then we got bourbon chicken with onions and mushrooms which was very tasty and firecracker shrimp with spicy noodles. The shrimp were sparse but the pasta was surprisingly good! We had left overs for the next day too. Their desserts are good too, especially the chocolate cake with ice cream. We used our gift cards and were very happy.  The server in the bar was friendly and attentive.  He served us quickly and with a smile and gave us drink refills right away. I'd try this restaurant on a weeknight or weekday rather than a crowded weekend night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
0,Chris V.,"Glendale, AZ",38,162,49.0,3.0,2017-08-07,"Overall not a bad experience.  I like their new menu with the toppers.  My GF got the steak topped with the fried Bacon Onions.  The broccoli looked a little old and the steak was a little tough.  Overall I believe it was $13.99 which isn't bad.  She got the 6oz steak. I got the Shrimp Asian bowl thing.  I asked for no Muchrooms but of course a few snuck in.  It tasted a little bland, not like I remembered from the other Applebees in Phoenix.  Waitress and manager came over and they did a great job.  Place was nice and clean.  It was a Saturday around noon so we were sat right away. An average lunch.  Tab came to $40 as we did get an app.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
47,V H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2017-08-19,Went to applebees to wait for a appointment we were to early for. We went straight to the bar and sat. In front of my seat on the bar was a big puddle of brown liquid not a good start. The bartender was very pleasant and said she would clean the puddle. She made my husband and I a drink and never cleaned the mess.  We sat and visited and my husband said I needed to drink up it was time to go. The next thing I hear is what the h*ll. I look at my husband and he is pulling something out of his mouth it was glass. It cut the roof of his mouth and tongue. The bartender came over and saw the glass and my husbands tongue bleeding. She got manager and he saw the glass was chipped . He said he would cover our drinks and asked if we needed to file a report. We were so done and just walked out. If my husband would of swallowed glass it could have been really bad. This place is not clean or caring . Avoid!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-10?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
