61,Katie E.,"Mesa, AZ",104,72,1.0,1.0,2012-11-13,"Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar. However, we went with a group of friends for the Veteran's Day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans. I was meeting someone for lunch later so I only had a drink, everyone else ordered a meal(including the veterans in our group). Here we are 2 days later and every single person, that ate there all have flu symptoms. I feel fine and coincidentally I didn't order anything to eat. Some line cook was probably sick and they wouldn't let him call out since they were busy for the holiday.

However, went to restaurant this past Saturday, at 4:30pm with my husband, son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters. It was empty!!! Yet it took over 25 minutes to get our meals. Mine - salmon - was overdone, vegetables were awful and potatoes were lacking. Pushed my plate away after tasting the salmon. Shared ribs with my husband - they were ""okay'  - not great ...BUT the chicken wanton tacos were AWESOME!! (my daughter-in-law shared!). These were piping hot so apparently all of our dinners were cooked first and waited on the wanton tacos. After voicing my dislike for the salmon, manager came to our table, apologized and moved on. He did take it off the check. . Dessert then came late...they brought out cake/ice cream out WAY before they brought the sundae for my grand daughter's birthday. WHAT? Then it took over 15 minutes for us to get the check.  It was awful and we won't go here again. So  sad, cause it's right around the corner and convenient. But.....bad food, bad service?

Portions - it is amazing how much SMALLER they are getting.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip is at least 2 to 3 oz smaller over the years, or it seems.  This time it looked a little over cooked and blackened around the corners like it was OVER cooked in the microwave. The Caesar Salads, WAY TOO MUCH DRESSING.  There was MORE DRESSING than salad.  The steak, this time, WAS TOUGH AND CHEWY.  At least they had A-1.  My wife has Chicken and Shrimp which, lets say didn't sit well. My daughters, a little better with the pasta and fiesta lime chicken. If you want a steak, GO TO A STEAK HOUSE.  At least you know it will be A LOT BETTER THAN THIS PLACE.   Do I plan on going back, NOT ANY TIME SOON.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

It was busy and there was plenty of waitstaff, we didn't have to wait at all during dinner rush which was nice. I love seeing the many neighborhood locals who know each other as I got seated, I love that feel.  Our waitress Ashley was quick to greet and get drinks and appetizers going, she did a great job to check in frequently since we wanted some happy hour pricing drinks. The menu had great simplicity and variety, our kids actually ate all their food for once, and they stayed entertained with the tablet. I tried a new brew house dish and hubby had tasty wings. The manager was so sweet, she brought out our dish and noticed the fries looked like it sat out a while so she brought us new fries. That was very kind and I love her high expectations for quality and appreciate that. Our server Ashley was great, she was sweet and attentive. I will be back soon just for the fact that the staff were all great and the menu is something my kids will eat.

The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse.  I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy.  Overall, the meal was a great value.

15,Bryan B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,19,21.0,4.0,2017-03-06,"I haven't been to an Applebee's for a while, and had never been in this specific location, so decided to try it out. When entering, the first impression was positive, as the restaurant had a warm and comfortable decor. We opted to sit at the bar, as we sometimes do when there are open seats available. (This is a seating preference, even when not consuming alcohol, as was the case on this visit). The chairs at the bar were actually quite comfortable, as they were swivel chairs with padded seats and full back support. We were promptly greeted by the bartender/server and received our beverages very quickly, as well as 2 full menus and a smaller ""happy hour menu"".  We opted for the wings, which were on special for happy hour, as are ""half price appetizers"". We also decided to get some spinach artichoke dip and chips, since they were half price.  The wings came out of the kitchen surprisingly  quickly, and they actually arrived before the chips and spinach dip. (I think the dip took longer to prepare, and it was very yummy when we did receive it, just a few moments after the wings). The food was prepared well and was tasty. We chose 3 different flavors of wings, and each were appropriately seasoned. They weren't the best wings I've ever had, but they were good, especially for the price.  The server provided good service, as she checked in with us regularly, kept our beverages refilled, and also offered to give us ""to-go"" cups when we were preparing to leave. All in all it was a pleasant dining experience, and with the happy hour prices, the tab was actually very affordable. I'm giving it 4 stars, as even though there was nothing spectacular that really made a strong or charismatic impression on me, conversely there was nothing negative to prompt me to rate it any lower.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Less than 10 tables with guests, and a few at the bar, but we waited almost 10 minutes for a server to notice and find us a table.  But it got better. Appetizer arrived with no plates or silverware. We asked for some. Then entres arrived, still no silverware. We asked about silverware again. The server rolled her eyes, then stopped at 2 tables to take orders before finally dumping 2 forks for 3 people on the table. We asked for an ETA on our drinks and maybe a third fork; we were told that the bartender was swamped (3 people sitting at the bar). So our server meandered to the back and maybe had a nap.

5,Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",207,177,352.0,3.0,2017-10-04,"I was never a big Applebee's fan but when I was younger my mother and I would always go to the Farmingdale multiplex to watch scary movies with her co-workers and then eat at the Applebee's right there so it holds a special place in my heart. However, I only ever went for 2-fer's or  1/2 price apps after 10pm after that and was never really satisfied with their food so I abandoned Applebee's for TGIF. Well, TGIF's are few and far between in Arizona (there's literally two) and for some reason, a lot of places I hated on the east coast are WAY better on the west coast so I decided to give Applebee's another chance. My husband and I had been going to one closer to my mouse and I loved that one, no complaints, so when we spotted this location the other day while driving around, we gladly stopped in. This Applebee's is a little run-down. Our table was a little sticky and the leather seating had a big cut down the middle which irritated my legs. Our waiter was really friendly though, I told my husband he looked like an old-time Cowboy movie star and based on this piece of info alone, if you ever go to this location, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about, lol. My husband ordered the boneless wing appetizer as an entrée and I ordered the smallest sirloin they had with a size of fries (to give my husband) and a side of bacon macaroni and cheese.  Our food took a while to come out, especially for a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't particular busy, but we just played some games on the table kiosk so no big deal. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well down with some char around the edges. I wasn't going to say anything but I decided to just mention it to waiter since usually they stay around and have you cut into your steak to check the cook on it. He asked if I wanted to send it back which I declined because it had taken quite a while and then asked if I wanted to take a brand new one home. I accepted his order and he actually had the kitchen remake my entire order so I got a meal to take home. I was super surprised that he did that since I ate my macaroni and my husband and I devoured those fries.  He even had me cut into my steak before he bagged it up for me to take home. My husband said his wings were so-so and commented that he preferred the other Applebee's better which I do too but the service at this Applebee's is great. The manager came around to check on us as well as she was apologetic about the steak. Overall, we probably won't be back to this location because it's so out of our way but even though my first steak was off, they went above and beyond to fix the mistake and the service was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
