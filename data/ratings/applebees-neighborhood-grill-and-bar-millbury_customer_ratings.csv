8,Jay R.,"Worcester, MA",1,26,4.0,1.0,2012-09-08,Tried the blackened tilapia and it was delicious. Good news stops there. I live near this applebees and loved it when they first opened. Now its a joke. Prices are hefty considering the bird food sized portions. Its like every time i come here they find a new way to skimp. Boneless chicken breast are tiny and cost too much. Call me a fatty but 7 nuggets isnt worth $10. Appetizer my foot! Even my blondie dessert was a dissapointment. This will be my last time going to an applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20,,,,,
28,Nicole L.,"Worcester, MA",27,331,174.0,3.0,2012-09-15,Well they redeemed themselves slightly after this visit. The server was perfect- timely with meals refills and very social. The spinach artichoke dip was good. Not a  huge fan anymore as they always taste the same.  The Cajun shrimp pasta was very spicy - yum. I live to actually taste the food.  Portions were good. It was a meal deal with 2 entree and appetizer for $20. Reasonable price but they charge for ice tea refill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
2,Ali S.,"San Antonio, TX",6,203,61.0,5.0,2013-10-19,Been here twice and both the times had great experience. The service and food both were great and I love there deals which make things really affordable. Will come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20,,,,,
27,Matthew P.,"Blackstone, MA",0,16,1.0,4.0,2014-11-22,"So I'm not usually an Applebee's fan. Which is why the 4 instead of 5 stars. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised today. Took my daughter out for daddy daughter date after figure skating and this was her choice. Was greeted warmly, seated fast and Stephani our server was awesome. Had our drinks in less than 2 minutes. Food was very good, which surprised me. Grilled chicken wasn't dry which it almost always is at these types of places. Service was so good the manager brought my daughter a spoon for her yogurt because he noticed that she didn't have one. I will definitely come back here again next time my daughter asks for Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
24,Bob J.,"Millbury, MA",14,29,9.0,5.0,2015-01-06,"2 for $25 Bourbon Steak for me, Ribs for Jody. Always good witha side salad, and a hot fudge slider. Slider is a small glass with ice cream and hot fudge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
18,Warren L.,"Worcester, MA",39,143,919.0,4.0,2015-05-31,"We ate here at lunch time.  Everything was AOK.  Service was speedy, kitchen was OK, food was OK.  I personally dislike Velveeta style cheese, which is what they used on my burger (Brew Pub Philly).  I prefer cheese that's not in liquid form.  Although we try to avoid chain restaurants as we like local color, for a chain restaurant, I would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
20,Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149.0,1.0,2015-09-10,"It was bad. I went twice (an error I know) because I kind of forgot how awful it was. Other the two trips five meals were ordered, two total were correct, and two total were sent back (one was incorrect but the person made due). The food is pretty standard chain fare but they tend to botch it, over or under cooking it. They also are somehow consistently out of whatever it is you want to order, three times in our two trips people had to go with a second choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
22,Annie R.,"South Grafton, MA",72,3,,1.0,2016-02-25,"Had a horrible experience with this Applebees last night. The drinks weren't even good, I got a patron margarita all I tasted was the magarita mix and no patron. Then the waitress I had let me bring it back and gave me a skinny magarita, in this drink all I tasted was soda. Then the dinner came out, I got the quesadilla burger, it wasn't even cooked through completely. And when we were leaving out the door, they didn't even say ""thank you for coming"" (as they usually do). I'm very disappointed because I've gone here before plenty of times and never had a problem. The night shift needs a change big time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
23,Brendan O.,"Arlington, MA",1,82,,5.0,2016-02-28,I want people to go through the awesome appetizers and ask if your stomach and taste buds aren't perfectly happy! The Server apologized twice for the wait and double-checked the accuracy of the order. They're great at what they make and always priced right! Yummy go just go don't think twice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
25,Jennifer L.,"South Hadley, MA",38,4,,4.0,2016-03-15,"It's Applebees so the food is consistently good. However, the service here was amazing. Fantastic waitress who went out of her way to be sweet to my kids and give my elderly grandparents directions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
15,Nikki N.,"Worcester, MA",11,91,54.0,1.0,2016-06-13,"My friend and I got the Fiesta Lime Chicken meal from here. My chicken was super rubbery and got me sick after the first bite. They offered to make me a new meal and it came out still rubbery and decided that it was time to go home. The manager offered me a free dessert which was nice, but overall the food was terrible. Applebee's is ONLY good for appetizers and drinks, other than that you should probably stay away from any of the chicken dishes if you care about your health.  The dishes and tables were still dirty.  Our waiter was nice and patient, but he was just annoyed as me throughout this experience. I won't be coming back here any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
21,Katie F.,"Millbury, MA",52,11,3.0,4.0,2016-07-08,Good restaurant with some great bartenders! Food is good and better then Fridays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
10,Sharon V.,"Quincy, MA",437,374,1426.0,3.0,2017-02-26,"I sat at the bar with some friends. The bartender Jose was super duper nice.  As for the food, my Fiesta Lime Chicken had way too much cheese on it.  It was like would you like some chicken with your cheese?  I know it's a chain restaurant and not a five star socialite restaurant, but you can def tell the chicken was just microwaved.  I could of gave it to my dog as a chew toy. The restaurant itself is very clean and they do make a nice cocktail!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
14,A K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,21.0,1.0,2017-04-09,O wow... just peaked at some of the reviews. Most of em are 1-2 star reviews ... but I can definitely relate.  ... #1 problem is BOH: food comes out way tooooooo slow and nasty (especially the rubbery chicken): ordered the 2/$25 deal and the appt came an hr after then the food came out 1/2 hr after (have pictures with the times taken to prove it)  All the chicken orders came out tasting rubbery and dry. The skillet was not even hot.. Everything were extra salty ..  ... #2 problem is service: he never introduced us to him but saw his name on the receipt.. name is Thomas. He literally came by 3 times... one to take the order.. 2nd cuz we flagged him down for another drink.. 3rd for the check.. (never even asked for desserts but figured it was going to take another hr so Whatever) we wanted to pay by card but because he wasn't coming back.. we left him all the cash we had.. Either he doesn't know how to take several tables at once or he just purposely was avoiding us... not sure but it was pretty bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
17,Brad L.,"Auburn, MA",0,4,,1.0,2017-04-15,Was sat right away and felt like we were a mirage Sat in The middle of the bar room. A waiter seemed as though he was gonna present himself to the table but got caught up helping people he knew that came in well after us... no one came over our whole time of staying at almost 20 min there. We left and walked next door for a great meal. Could not believe how bad the service was. I'd recommend everyone to go next door to T.G.I. Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
19,Emily B.,"Worcester, MA",0,4,,5.0,2017-04-27,This place was so nice! My family has dined at Applebee's twice now and the staff was great! They were very attentive and the food was delicious. Thank you so much for the great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,,,,,
16,Jacqueline K. D.,"Milford, MA",36,3,,1.0,2017-04-30,Came here for a drink with my bf he got a couple shots then a drink I got one shot then proceeded to wait and wait while the bartender played cards with her co workers! Then about ten mins later we had to flag her down and ask for another drink when she told my bf he couldn't have another because they have a 3 drink max. She should've told us that in the beginning! I'm so disappointed I will never be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
11,Nishitha S.,"North Grafton, MA",252,36,7.0,4.0,2017-05-04,"Pretty surprised at all the crappy reviews! My mom and I dropped by here on a weekday for lunch (our first Applebee's experience). She ordered the lemon chicken dish and I got the chicken tender mac and cheese.  The portions were great. Not a huge plate like most chain restaurants. We both finished our meals with our stomachs content. The food came SUPER fast (kind of weird cuz that makes me think about how/ when it's made), but it was delicious! I docked a star because their dishes are not at all customizable and if a dish on the menu has bacon, then you'll get bacon. But again this is a chain restaurant.  The / / mac and cheese combo went together better than expected. Oh and we also got the onion rings for the app and they were AMAZINGLY crispy and hot and not overly greasy. Best onion rings I've had in a while.  I guess the time to come is middle of the day on a weekday folks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
13,Casz M.,"Worcester, MA",69,24,53.0,4.0,2017-05-17,Steak was very well done. The garlic mash are always a fav for me and they have always made it great.
