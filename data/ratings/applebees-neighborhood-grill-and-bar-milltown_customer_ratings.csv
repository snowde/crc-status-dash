30,Rad B.,"Dayton, NJ",76,214,9.0,2.0,2012-02-05,"So I really liked the local applebees when I was at Rutgers (the one in piscataway). It was awesome running into friends and having the happy hr drinks and apps but this particular location has been terrible time and again. A couple of girlfriends and I went here last week and we ordered drinks at happy hour. My cosmo and margarita tasted like fruit juice. Now I know that it's a $4 drink but seriously? I could taste no alcohol AND it wasn't mixed very well. We were looking forward to a fun but mellow night out but we were thoroughly disappointed (to the point where we didnt even order our favorite spinach and artichoke dip app). I'm not particularly bothered by the teeny boppers who frequent this place but seriously, the drinks were fit for two year olds. Bottomline: if you live in the NB/EB/SB area, make the longer trip to the p-way applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown?start=20,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

36,Tiffany C.,"Bronx, NY",7,36,15.0,4.0,2012-08-21,What can I say...It's a chain restaurant that serves decent American food.  I mostly go for the 1/2 price apps during late night happy hour.  This location is clean and the staff is very friendly.  My husband and I ordered the quesadilla and were not fans of it at all!

21,Christian C.,"Milltown, NJ",550,369,290.0,1.0,2013-04-30,I hate you Crapplebee's. It's the worst chain restaurant and I find myself here tooo often. My girlfriend and friends always make a late night case of cheap pints and half priced apps. but I think I'm gonna stop suckering in to it. The only thing on the menu worth ordering is the wonton tacos at half price BUT they got rid of the pork ones! Only chicken....lame. If I paid the $7 asking price anytime before 10pm I would not be in the slightest satisfied. My girlfriend likes the Veg burger but I always tell her I'd rather go ANYWHERE ELSE. Writing this review is getting me upset about the amount of times I've been stuck in Crapple's waiting to leave.. They used to show the UFC fights WITH cheap beer and half price apps but even that couldn't fill the place up so they stopped.  During Football season I got talked into going here for cheap wings and they were the worst wings I've ever had.......ok maybe tied with The Grove. The wings came out cold and dry.

15,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",432,575,457.0,3.0,2013-06-03,"Applebee's is a great place to go after 10 pm. Half off appetizers every day (minus their sampler dish). Their food isn't bad, and at half off, there's really no place better to go. I can't really tell you about anything else there because I've only eaten here after 10 pm and I've only gotten their appetizers and desserts. Service is okay. I wish the waitress is around a little bit more to fill up my water. This is a recurring thing I've noticed. Food is pretty good. I've had their potato twisters (which I mistakenly thought were potato skins), nachos, chicken quesadillas, traditional wings, spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks  and their queso dip. I'm pretty sure I just read you the entire menu. Not a big fan of the potato twisters; they're really just twisted potato chips, but the queso dip that came with it was really good. Spin dip, nachos and chicken quesadillas are my favorite dishes.  As for dessert (yes it needed a separate paragraph), my absolute favorite is the Cookie Sundae. It costs $6.50, where I am at least, and it is DELICIOUS. It is this gigantic warm cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on the bottom with chocolate drizzled on top. The cookie is so soft and warm and pairs nicely with the ice cream. My second favorite is definitely the chocolate lava cake. You can't beat a chocolate filled brownie that just oozes chocolate when you break its' center. Yummmmmmm. That is also served with vanilla ice cream. Overall, good place to hang out with friends after 10 pm and to grab a cheap bite to eat or if you're in the mood for a delicious cookie sundae.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
26,Natalia P.,"Philadelphia, PA",244,191,23.0,2.0,2013-07-02,"I went here on the whim after an invite from a friend. I dislike most chain restaurants, so my review might be a bit biased. Even on a weekday, this location is fairly crowded. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table for 3 people. It wasn't really a big deal, just to give you a heads up. I don't think they take reservations, as there was a party of 18 waiting for 45 minutes. I think that the main reason why people frequent this chain is for the half off menu. We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu. It was plenty to split between three people, as portions are huge. The boneless wings are great for appetizer, variety of sauces. We got them in honey bbq sauce. Out of the entrees, I got the fiesta lime chicken. It was basically chicken covered in melted cheddar cheese with tortilla bits, salsa sauce, and spiced rice. Oriental chicken salad included crisp chicken chunks in a iceberg lettuce-like salad covered in way too much creamy dressing. Service was decent. Actually, the waitress was fairly quick to serve. Portions were big, so that we never got to desert.  All in all, I didn't like the food at all. It is not a place I would want to come back to eat again. But it serves its purpose for those seeking cheap eats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown?start=20,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

White peach sangria is the best I've ever had. Food always tastes fresh. The staff I have dealt with are all pleasant and willing to help. Managers are great. Never gone when it was PACKED, but definitely always seems busy. TVs all over, awesome wallpaper dedicated to many local schools. Overall a great atmosphere and I'll be coming back to this location every few months. Note to customers: Prices are cheap, TIP YOUR WAITERS AND WAITRESSES APPROPRIATELY! If you're a regular, and you don't tip, I wouldn't blame them for treating you poorly. They get paid about $3 an hour, survive on tips, and work long hours. Stop being cheap and give them what they deserve. If you can't afford to eat and tip, order something to-go or make your meals at home if you're struggling so bad. I hope they eventually get to put 18% gratuity on all their checks (no matter the party size) so the staff gets what they deserve!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown?start=20,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516

The waitress was nice and quick for being there on a Friday evening and was very courteous. The food was ok - after all, it is Applebee's - until I found hair in my pasta! Disgusting! When I brought it to the waitress' attention, the manager came over and was completely unprofessional. She rudely asked if I wanted another plate made and of course I declined. Why am I going to get another plate of food from a place that has hair in their food?! I told her no thank you, and she unapologetically walked away. They simply took the pasta dish off the bill and left everything the way it was. I wasn't looking for a free meal but I would think that if someone found something so gross in their food you would at least comp something - even a free drink to try to make up for it - and of course an I'm sorry would have been nice, too.

19,Dan W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",27,106,8.0,2.0,2013-12-12,I love Applebees but this location is garbagio (garbage in broken italian; pronounced gar-bah-ji-oh). We were in the half off zone when we went there (half-off apps after 10).  They did not have quesadilla towers which are the go to half off app.  They also alerteed me that they also ran out of the cheese for the brew pub pretzels so they gave us the queso dip instead (good but not the same and not something you want on your pretzels). On a more important note for the two stars the food here was just sub par tasting for an applebees.  Service was meh you can always tell when you dont get a water refill while youre there.  Bottom line is if you're going for half off apps they should have all the items there in stock.  we know theyre all frozen items tat are stuck in a cooker anyway whats so hard about keeping inventory?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
35,Danielle Z.,"North Brunswick, NJ",71,31,,1.0,2014-01-12,"My friends and I decided to go to this location out of convenience, what a big mistake that was. We should have gone even to Denny's would have been a better meal! I ordered the Quesadilla burger as I have had this in other restaurants and really have enjoyed it. Food was a bit slow to come out but not a big deal. My burger although was drenched in oil, so I called the manager over to complain, I was told well this is how the burger is due to the cheese and sauce they use, so I decided to opt for another burger the Bacon Cheese burger, I had to wait a little while my friends sat there and ate. The burger finally came out and this too was greasy and gross. I took the lettuce off as my son love to eat it and the amount of grease that was on it was gross. I ate half of it only cause I was so hungry but I did not even want to take the rest home. The fries were even pretty blah. The manager never even bothered to come check on me again to see if I liked this one. I had to ask our server to have her come back over. I asked the manager if they happen to use oil on the flat top to cook the burgers and her reply was. Well, we do not use a ""high quality of meat"", she even was pretty rude about the whole thing. Never offered to supply a comp on anything I had to argue with her to get the meal which was gross to get taken off. This is inexcusable for a burger that cost $9.99. I have gone to Mcdonalds and gotten a $1.00 burger that is not grease covered. I even got sick from the meal I had somewhat eaten, let's just say there was none of that meal left in me to throw up anymore but stomach acid. I would never go back to this location due to the poor costumer service and awful food I was served. I think this may have even tarnished me from going to any other locations as well!

Next server here was EXTREMELY slow on bringing out the appetizers and lemme tell you that the chicken wonton tacos shouldnt have been as spicy as they were.  They were VERY VERY spicy, almost like the siracha shrimp.  Why? Then I was interrupted several times when it was time to pay the check.  Why were you so slow on bringing the good out, yet when it was time to get paid you were rushing the hell out of me?  This is just unacceptable on so many accounts I can tell you I will never ever visit this place again.  I guess ill keep one star just because the chicken and shrimp (ALTHOUGH very overseasoned) was hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

Their newest menu also includes a lot of steak options. I feel like they're trying to go from ""family friendly"" to ""bar food"". Unfortunately, they do fall flat because at these prices, the food is incredibly mediocre. It's nice when it's half-off apps but I don't really see any other reason to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
3,Jennifer D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2005,646,2274.0,3.0,2016-10-20,Never had an issue at this location. It's a little off the beaten path so it's really never crowded. Food and service are what you expect at Applebee's (never horrible but never great).  As long as you know what you're walking into you won't be disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
14,Lisa G.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,10,,1.0,2016-11-16,Was just there 11/16/16. Waitress was great!!!!!!!!!!!!but on the menu does not explain very well i was charged extra cause i order  steak quesadilla at 9.99. But i also ordered french onion soup 5.69. They charged me 10.69 for steak quesadilla. All cause i order something else. Plus they said i would have gotten a smaller portion of the quesadilla cause i ordered the soup. I was like what im being charged more cause i ordered 2 things instead of just the quesadilla i was really. Well i was like um no so yes they took off the extra charge and the waitress was it's my fault i should have explained it to you. I was like no it does not say anything like that on the menu. So beware of how they like to charge you extra. And buy one get one free is a crock off s!!!. They have crapy selection. And no where on the menu does it say you cant take it to go. The manager was an asshole about the situation to. WILL NEVER GO BACK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

6,Mia Y.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",10,3,,1.0,2017-03-26,"Never been to an applebee's that had such bad food, appetizer wasn't even hot, entrees weren't even hot, coffee was horrible the only good thing was the fries, and they weren't even hot. Will never come to this place again. No wonder why it's covered by blindside!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
4,Sarah W.,"Bensalem, PA",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-22,This location was the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. The service was trash along with the food. The server forgot what table ordered what our appetizers were walked to every table before it came to us. Pasta had close to zero sauce on it. Ordered drinks that never arrived and went 95% of the visit without seeing our waitress. Burger was served without topping ordered and it took 20 min to find someone to bring them. They rely on the electronic pad to do their job for them but then still expect to be tipped well. Retraining needed. Customers come to a restaurant to be server not to have to chase down employees to receive the service they are paying for. Disgrace.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

1,Nikki S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",147,6,,1.0,2018-01-03,"Came here at 10 pm on New Year's Day. I will never return. The server kept going around to the other tables before coming to ours. After a few bites of the boneless wings, my friend had bad food poisoning and threw up. The service was terrible and the host had a rude demeanor. If you want uncooked food and clueless employees, then this is your place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-milltown,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
