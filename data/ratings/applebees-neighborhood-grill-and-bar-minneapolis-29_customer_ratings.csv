6,Becca R.,"Anoka, MN",0,15,,1.0,2013-10-26,Portion size terrible. Priced way to high. Not clean. Will not return to this location. We were very disappointed as usually we like applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
4,Nikk V.,"Andover, MN",46,2,25.0,5.0,2016-06-27,They got a new woodfire grill since the last time we came. The meat was SO much better quality and the food tasted so much better. I had the all day breakfast burger and would recommend it. Server was awesome and on top of things.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
0,Maxx M.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,413,2047.0,4.0,2016-06-29,"I came here on Saturday night and despite being SUPER busy, the food was good and the service was great! I've been to this location several times and I have yet to have a negative experience.  I actually expected problems on Saturday because it was so damn busy.  The parking lot was nearly full and almost every table was occupied.  There were 7 of us. Despite how crazy it was, our server was running all over the place but still managed to take good care of us and come back many times for various demands from the kids and the adults.  The food was good and it came out fast and hot. Thank you, Applebee's! -Daddy Maxx Retro",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
5,Zippity D.,"Anoka, MN",2,5,,2.0,2017-01-24,"Came in on Tuesday just before Happy Hour was over, at 5:55.  Our server was Amanda. She had little to no personality and seemed to be going through the motions...nothing exceptional,  friendly, warm, or welcoming. The French Onion soup came out with a hint of brown on the cheese, so we asked for it to be placed under the broiler so it would be much browner. Unfortunately, it was about the same, so we just figured they put it in an oven since the soup itself seemed over-cooked. We also had ordered a ""loaded"" baked potato without sour cream and it came out with sour cream. A manager or shift lead (no black uniform) brought it back without the sour cream, but never checked back after that. The kicker was when Amanda dropped off the bill and didn't say a word. ""Thank you"" woulda' been nice. Not sure we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
3,Joe M.,"Duluth, MN",22,102,27.0,5.0,2017-04-04,"My family are weekly regulars up at this Applebee's. This restuarant has some of the kindest, hardworking and personable bartenders, management and staff I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Angie, Mel and Elissa always go the extra mile while bartending and making that warm customer connection. The food is always great, never any problems and if there is they'd be happy to replace it or do what they can to make you happy. This is one of the busiest Applebee's there is in the state but your wait times are not bad whatsoever. In the fall, the weekly pick your team football leagues are a lot of fun! Truly, if you want to know why business is always booming here, it is because of the amazing and speedy service, the professional and personable staff and the great food and apps that Applebee's offers! I have never had the delight of a chain restuarant as I have with this location. The staff here are too good to family and I. If I could give this place 6/5 stars, I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
2,Jennifer D.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,50,,4.0,2017-05-06,Service is so so. Sat down right away but no server came to the table. Amanda came took over and did a wonderful job. To make up for the lack of service before Amanda took over they gave us a free desert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
1,Heidi A.,"Andover, MN",26,1,,2.0,2017-11-18,"Slowest service I have ever experienced. Terrible, we were comped the 4 meals that didn't show up until the rest of us were done eating. Can't tell if it's the server or the kite the kit or the management but it was terrible all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-29,,,,,
