8,Josh E.,"Minneapolis, MN",28,115,37.0,2.0,2012-07-21,"This Applebees in particular, was very very small, busy and bustling with many friendly faces as far as servers go. The food was sub par and the waiting time was terrible, although our server was nice enough to keep checking on us at least every 5 minutes. They would be up at least to four stars, but when I am out for my birthday and my steak and shrimp comes out slightly cold (I order steak to be served at medium rare, so cold steak is a no no anywhere) I was not satisfied at all. The drinks were really good though and the service was friendly, so thats why they hang on to 2 stars. Other than that though I would suggest finding a different Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
0,Joshua W.,"Minneapolis, MN",89,256,9.0,4.0,2012-10-29,"Sat at the bar, although I missed out on the late night happy hour...I was too hungry and an hour too early, but the bartender was great and remembered I liked Sam Adams, even though I hadn't been to this location since July. He also works at Williams in Uptown and is really great. I had the appetizer trio, the queso dip was surprisingly good and pretty spicy, the buffalo wings also good, but wasn't a big fan of the spinach artichoke dip. Way too much spinach in that one for my taste. Anyways good regular crowd atmosphere and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
9,Kerry T.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,8,5.0,5.0,2014-06-03,"Absolutely wonderful service and delicious food. The food is like any I have found at Applebee's. However, every time we go to this location, we have gotten great service!  Having worked as a server for many years, I know what to look for and each server we have had has been amazing!  As at many chain restaurants, they do try to up sell, but the servers know how to do their job! Each time we go, the place is clean and someone is there to greet us at the door. Great place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
11,Markus C.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,5.0,2014-08-01,Have never had a problem here.  The service is always awesome and the food is delicious.  We actually go out of our way to go to this Applebee's even though there is one closer to our home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
10,Jason P.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,8,5.0,3.0,2015-03-03,I'm a fan and a regular. I have NEVER been disappointed. Now that the remodel is done it's even a better place to stop in when your ready for a beer and a good meal. Feeding Veterans a free meal year in and year out leaves me with faith in this chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
7,K M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,,1.0,2015-11-08,"After this experience I will not ever be returning to Applebees.  Even though I didn't get a receipt when I paid electronically and the review is way too long to post and complicated to write,  I will be sending management an e mail. If I got a receipt to take the survey I would but I Already had a day that everything went wrong... This experience last night makes it my last visit to Applebees ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
3,Kayla L.,"Lincoln, NE",3,21,3.0,5.0,2016-05-22,"Came here for some drinks on a Sunday night. Our bartender, Emily, was very enthusiastic, friendly, attentive to all customers' needs, and made great suggestions for drinks. She was taking care of three tables and the whole bar, and still managed to make sure everyone had a great time! Thank you, Emily!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
2,Tony P.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,21,7.0,2.0,2016-06-11,"Applebee's has always offered good food, good size portions and we tend to pick Applebee's over the other chains. The bar doesn't do anything for us but it's nice to have as an option. The service at this particular location is troubling. We were seated immediately and that's where the waiting started. The server walked passed us confused at least a dozen times and finally was asked for our drink order. The timer was 13 minutes 56 seconds. To be fair, the place is busy and I can understand that but servers should definitely at least acknowledge us. We understand bad nights and will return.  Update: our server Michael did just update us that the kitchen is having a bad night and no longer accepting orders. I have never heard of Applebee's closing early.  Maybe the management and staff need some training?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
4,Glenn C.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,15,2.0,1.0,2016-07-10,"Worst Applebees ever! Ordered a simple nacho's to go by phone at 11:17 pm on a Sunday. Guy said ""Great, we'll have it ready for you in 8 minutes!"" I just moved to the neighborhood and was there in 5. Bartender seemed to be the only person who knew their job. I gave the manager my name, he said ""I'll get it right now"" and went into the kitchen and never came out. At 11:42, I gave up and left. When you have mediocre food to start with, you can't afford to have awful service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
6,Louis T.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,19,2.0,5.0,2016-09-05,"Love Applebees but found this location to be the best.  Great food and the service was good.  Love the remodel.  Staff knows their menu well, food was tasty and hot, and came out in great time.  Hope the manager here continues to maintain training and keeping the great team members they have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
5,Rose M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,1.0,2016-12-27,Every time I come to this applebees they always take forever to come serve me and bring out my food. It's not even busy and they take forever. Then when the food comes out everything is cold and hard. I complain every time because i always give them so many chances but then they always disappointed me. Never coming here again! Waste of time and money!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
1,Thea A.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,12,4.0,1.0,2017-04-07,"Horrible dining experience. I should've believed the reviews. OMG! The Southwestern steak salad came with 4 oz. of top sirloin. The Oriental chicken salad was not what I had years ago. I recall an oranged glazed crispy chicken on a bed of crisp romaine. The chicken salad dressing was more like poppy seed dressing. Not a ginger-orange glazed dressing with a tad of sweet. The appetizer sampler was dis-gust-ting. Where's the artichokes? (a la Clara) The artichoke dip was a canned soupy mess of spinach and plastic cheese. Think Styrofoam melted in the microwave. The red sauce was a peppery, vinegary bland concoction of I don't know what kind of tomato. I hadn't seen my boyfriend in a week and wanted to go out have fun Friday night. I think he still loves me even though the meal sucked. Oh, do not eat at any Applebees if you value your stomach and palate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minneapolis-30,,,,,
