174,Richard G.,"Corona, CA",3,10,28.0,3.0,2012-05-31,Went to Applebees for lunch today. Was not my best experience here. Now i have to say it wasn't really Applebees fault. Our hostess and server were both very friendly and prompt. We were just seated next to a couple of screaming kids that kind or ruined my overall experience here. I like kids just not screaming in my ears while I'm trying to eat.  As for the food........now first I have to throw out there that I'm the worlds most pickiest eater. I ordered the new fried green tomato and turkey sandwich. The sandwich sounded like a somewhat healthy pick but it was actually very greasy. Probably from the fried green tomato im guessing. The rest of the foods and drinks were good.

This place is usually very packed so that's another reason why we normally sit in the bar area.  It's quicker. I had the cajun shrimp pasta and it was surprisingly good.  The sauce had a good flavor and they give you a good amount of shrimp, which were also very good.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.   The service sometimes is not that great here, but if you sit in the bar area, hopefully you'll get ""Michael"".  He's really attentive, helpful, and doesn't treat you like a number.  We usually come here once or twice a month, and whenever we get lucky and he's our waiter, he always gives us great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=140,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003
92,Amber Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,6.0,2.0,2012-07-20,"The customer service here was so bad.  Let me start off by saying that this was my first time ever coming to an applebee's and probably my last time.  When my boyfriend and I came in, the lady sat us in the bar area...I was kind of turned off by this atmosphere because I was just expecting to eat at a nice restaurant without any neon lights and tv's all over the place. It was just loud and not what i was expecting.  So, the waitress comes over and asks for our drinks and while she's doing that, she's blatantly flirting with my boyfriend. I don't know bout ya'll, but that kind of ticked me off. Anyway, I got over it and was just trying to enjoy myself.  It was kind of hard hearing my boyfriend in the bar area because there were tv's with their volumes up and older people kicking back after a day at work. My boyfriend asked another waiter if we could switch to the other side and the waiter was like ""why..."" and my boyfriend replied ""well it's just too loud over here and the other side looks a lot more quieter"" and he replies, ""well, its not that much quieter over there, it just seems quieter because it's a bigger space."" ....what? Like, what kind of logic is that? After a couple times going back and forth he finally said ""alright, then"" and seated us to another table. It honestly felt like we were such a huuuugeeee burden to him when we just asked to move tables. I work in the retail business and deal with customers all the time and if they're unhappy about something, I do anything in my power to make sure they walk out satisfied with what they purchased. I just dont understand why he was so irritated when we asked him to move. Isn't that his job... to make the customers have an enjoyable experience. The other side of the restaurant was not even half full. I'm the type of person that doesn't really complain while I'm there, so to get that kind of reaction kind of ticked me off.  The food was mediocre but when I got home, my dad told me that applebees just unfreezes a bunch of food in the microwave and deep fryer. So, I'd say if you wanted that kind of food, just go to a fast food restaurant and not waste your money and time going here. there are a lot better places to eat and that deserve your money in the area, trust me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=140,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

The chicken had obviously been left in the microwave too long, and the steak had some sort of chemical tasting sauce that tasted like it was made from a concoction of ingredients found under a kitchen sink. When the waitress asked us how the food was we told her it was bad, we did not want to go into detail on how awful this mess that they called food was. The waitress went to the manager who in turn came to our table, and literally got down on his knees and asked us "" what you had that you not like""...Uhhh, first of all, stand up when you are talking to me, second, the food we not like, and third, we also didn't like the little act from the second waitress who delivered the so called bourbon street steak...yes, they did not bring both meals to the table at the same time....the waitress who brought the steak had to go through a painful routine of smelling the food, waving her hand over the food like she was fanning the elegant aroma into her nostrils , and asking me if I "" really want the steak, it smells so good""....Really?, it smelled like ass you twit, now stop molesting peoples meals when you bring them to the table. The manager decided to take the food off the bill (good thing because I was not going to pay for this garbage anyway), and told us that next time, he would personally ""walk us through the menu"" , Ok, first off, there will be no next time Franky, second, why on earth would I need you to ""walk"" me through your menu?...I am sure I can read far better than you, lord knows I speak better English.

Will never eat there again . I don't even go if people invite me.  Last time I was there I asked for lemonade and the waitress brings me something made from a packet mix. Really? People are supposed to be satisfied with that? How much freaking trouble and why is it too much to ask to squeeze a lemon and put sweet water in a glass? The mix tastes disgusting. Gee the bar has tons of lemons, so the lame excuse of a response, "" Oh we can't do that"" is not only lame, it is rude. Their menu is strange and for some reason seems very limited in choice. And they don't like substitution requests or modifications, not even simple ones. Some of the food at this place is ok, but not outstanding, and some of it is gross and has too much of a chemical taste. I believe restaurants like this are trying to weed dining customers out and focus on and expand the bar, because that's where the real profits are. You certainly don't go to places like this for the food, or do you? And if so, why? It's gross, one preservative or another and far too much salt The ambiance is urban sprawl casual with views of the parking lot, street and stores in certain corners of the restaurant. There is a huge bar on the other side. The design inside reminds me of The Outback, (same company?)  but I like the Outback. Applebees?

Finally our food arrived and my steak was more than well done when I asked for medium well. I spoke to your manager onsite (white, older, salt and pepper hair) and he seemed less than concerned. He told me he'd stop by my table which he did to only offer to recook my steak after I had already told him we waited too long. I reiterated that we've waited too long by that point and declined his offer and asked for the check. He came back and said hed comped us $10 when my meal was $17.99 unbelievable!!!! I've never had such terrible service but to have two employees not have much concern for their lack of performance was beyond disappointing.

The hostess sat us quickly and at first our waitress was friendly enough. I always order for my daughter upon seating and she put in the order and brought out her juice very quickly which I appreciated. So definitely a good start. The weirdness started after. My mom went to order the wonton taco's but then realized she could get them in a trio special and sample a couple other items. I heard her tell the server instead of the tacos I want the trio with wanton taco, pretzels, and a steak quesadilla. Easy enough right? Wrong. They bring out a plate of wonton tacos and the trio. That's a lot of freakin wonton tacos for one person. When the server came by she told her about the extra order and the server said I thought you ordered both. My mom is way nicer then me and told her she didn't but it was fine. The server replied okay good and walked away. Umm.....we were both dumbfounded. Then not even five minutes later she brings our check and places it standing up between my mom and I who were talking. We weren't half way done with our food. She claimed it was for convenience. Once again ummm... Then she went to check on the table next to us turned around and asked if the check was ready to go. No, I've taken like three bites. I laid down the book so I can talk since you obstructed my view of who I was speaking too. So odd, and so rushed. It's not like we take our sweet time, my daughter was well behaved and it wasn't busy. We seriously had just gotten our food an for as much as it is id like to have enjoyed it. We were also charged for the wontons that weren't ordered. I wanted to speak to the manager but like I said before my mom is super nice and doesn't like making a fuss.  Overall the food was tasty.

We were promptly seated and the hostess was excited to tell us of their custom tablets that could be used to order appetizers and desserts, or even pay the bill. Our server came over and this is when it all went downhill. She was friendly and smiling the entire time through. She offered us FRESH strawberry lemonade, my girlfriend's favorite, with strawberries in it. She took my order as well, a root beer. She came back with our drinks and informed us the restaurant was out of strawberries (really? At 3pm? The restaurant was practically empty), but instead of asking us if we wanted something else to substitute the drink, because the fresh strawberries was what my girlfriend had been hoping for, our sever just brought out pink lemonade from the tap and still charged us the full price. She also brought raspberry ice tea. Not even close to soda, and put it on the bill as ""pepsi"". Then we went to ordering ""2 appetizers for 9.50"" the menu said. Our server failed to tell us that the tablet didn't have the option of doing the combo deal so we ordered two regular sized appetizers thinking we would still get the 9.50 deal. Then I ordered the pepper crusted steak with whole grains, medium rare. My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders platter for her sister that was with us (literally the ONLY thing they got right). Our server left, another table was seated in front of us, business went on. The appetizers were alright. Spinach artichoke dip had very thin chips, every single chip broke as you tried to dip them, not to mention they were unevenly salted (one would be bland the other would be just a thing full of salt). The siracha shrimp was alright. Nothing special. It was fried shrimp with a very salty, not so siracha flavored coating.  Then the table in front of us got their food. Excuse me? We had gotten there first, and we both ordered steaks, different kinds, but how does your kitchen work when a customer who orders practically half an hour after you get their food first? Anyway. Our food eventually came out. My steak? Well done. I asked for medium rare. I had the food sent back. The chicken tenders were made perfect fine. My steak came back out. Medium well, close to well done again. I said ""forget it. Sure my steak is fine"". I took a bite: chewy and not seasoned at all. I took a bite of the rice and spinach and tomatoes that came with the dish and it was disgusting. I can't really describe the taste for you other than it was very chewy, the spinach tasted over cooked, and the tomatoes were filled with the seasoning but in juice form.  Absolutely tired and disappointed with the food, I asked for a box when the waitress came by. I paid while I waited. The box never came. The server was off helping 2 other tables. Let's talk about the service. Like I mentioned the hostess was great- friendly, energetic, a smile the entire time. Our waitress was nice as well, but not very helpful. She decided to check on us either too frequently at the wrong time, or not enough at the right time. She asked us how our food was, but our appetizers hadn't  been on the table for more than 2 minutes. Then she wasn't very courteous about placement of food either, she shoved and placed the plates wherever she felt she could put them. Then she asked us again in a very quiet, mumbled voice,  5 minutes later with our mouths full. I had to ask her to repeat herself. Then when our actual food came out, she was no where to be found. She did ask how it was and proceeded to walk away when we hesitated to answer about the incorrect cooking of the steak. She politely took the plate back and got a new entree done. Two minutes after receiving it, and putting a small piece in my mouth, she came up from behind and asked ""how's your steak?"" - somewhat creepily. I was startled and had a mouth full, and just answered ""oh it's fine"" before really getting to taste it, but she scurried away. The steak actually was under seasoned and medium well, close to well done again. Then we never saw her until she passed by us to help another customer. When I confronted her about the appetizer deal, she tried to explain it as ""oh the deal has smaller portions..."" and I said, ""The tablet doesn't have the option... It just says what you can order"". She looked flustered (even though she knew we were going to order appetizers since we sat down and TOLD her we were going to order them from the tablet) and proceeded to try and scurry away to try and attempt to get someone to help her. I just was over it at this point and said ""it's fine, though"". Though next time, they should tell their customers that since the tablets are KNEW, they should feel free to ask the server for help or just have the server take the order. Not a happy customer. We will NOT be returning to ANY Applebee's restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=100,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.18,2.76

He says ""oh of course, all of our burgers have the pickles."" So great, now we have to send them back while the kids eat and wait. Both came back looking and tasting terrible. We notify the manager who apologizes.  Long story short, even though both burgers were terrible (wife ate less than half and I ate even less), the server drops the bill off and says ""we took both burgers off, sorry about that."" I was relieved, I didn't have to pay for something I didn't eat. WRONG, he lied. He took one off and left the other.

108,Lilibeth G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,1.0,2016-08-18,"Waitress was initially super friendly. She did come by a few too many times while we waited for the other half of our party to see if we were ready to order. Once she took our order and brought us our drinks everything went downhill from there.  The food took forever. She brought out appetizers without bringing any utensils or plates but we were starving and just used our fingers anyway and didn't mind too much. Then it took a really long time for the entrees to come out. Steaks were burned which I get its not a nice steak house or anything but don't bother asking how I want my steak done if they are all going to come out medium.  Water was never refilled once during the whole meal. Asked for a drink refill and waitress acknowledged it twice but didn't bring it over until the end of the meal. Ordered 2 sides of sweet potato fries to go along with the steaks we ordered. Sweet potato fries arrived well after we were done with the meal. One of which arrived cold and unappetizing to which I wondered why the hell did we wait so long when the fries were just sitting back there?? After we informed the person that brought the fries (who was not the waitress) that we had two orders the manager personally came by and brought the fries and apologized for the ""few minute delay"" but never apologized for the terrible service. My brother asked for a frozen lemonade refill and the manager said they don't refill those to which my brother replied I thought you were the manager? He said he was. I couldn't help but laugh because the measly refill could've prevented the bad review. It was an opportunity to reverse a customer's poor experience at his restaurant. But nothing. To top it off the waitress finally came back and said here's your bill and check it thoroughly to make sure you know what you're paying for. I expected a comp on something, anything. One drink. But again, nothing. I should've left nothing on the tip but I've been in the service industry. I paid the 15% but left feeling quite angry, enough to wake me from my Yelp slumber.

67,Joe G.,"Eastvale, CA",410,550,5225.0,4.0,2017-01-23,"I remember when Applebee's was all the buzz. It was a place I would frequent with college classmates and eventually became a regular rotation for the family. The Eastvale location has been a regular part of my family since moving here 6 years ago; offers a simple and easy menu to please every eater. It has been a long time since eating at this location, probably since I have been into Yelp, so this place doesn't offer that excitement like most new spots. Kids wanted to eat here, so I decided to entertain their idea since they usually accompany me on most of my Yelp adventures.  Restaurant is family friendly and offers a separate bar area for those who want to escape the dining area. I like to dine in the bar area but now there is a waiting list when it is busy inside. Service is usually a bit slower because there are only a couple of servers covering about 15 tables. The bartender covers the bar area, people sitting at the bar, and the restaurant.  Kid's meals are simple and do not come overloaded with food. I think it is the perfect amount for a small child. I do enjoy the lighter calorie meals. You can even get a semi-decent steak here for under $15. I like the portion sizes for the regular meals as well. I like to get the salads and ask for the dressing on the side because the cooks usually drench it and you will have lettuce that floats.  Happy hour menu is just okay. I have seen it evolve over the years. The HH menu was great back in the day but now they have limited to just a few items. I tried the won ton tacos. The tacos were surprisingly good but would easily fit in the palm of your hand. Everyone is nice at this location. In fact, I do not think I have ever had a negative experience at any Applebee's besides the wait time on food. Whenever they are semi-busy it seems to take forever for your order to show. Drinks are good. Nice to see they still had my good old friend Brewtus. This location is cool. Easy place to grab a bite and see some familiar faces working. Inexpensive place to feed the family.

Then, everyone's salad came but mine, and no one brought it! Next thing I know everyone is done with their salads and they're bringing out the main entree's and I'm like, uh, I never got my salad!

13,Jose U.,"Rialto, CA",0,1,,5.0,2017-02-01,"Hey All,  Although I have never really been much of a Yelp reviewer, I felt that this particular experience at this Applebee's warranted coming onto this site and making an account.  On January 29th, 2017, I decided to meet up with some old friends for food and drinks at this location. Although, admittedly, Applebee's food and drinks don't necessarily blow me away, we figured why not, considering it was on the way to our destination. The reason for this review is for one thing only: TO PRAISE OUR SERVER MARK! In the 23 years that I have been on this Earth, I have never had a server as attentive, funny and just downright good at his job at this guy. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host and Mark immediately stepped in, asking us how our day had been so far and showing up to a table large enough to fit our group. Upon being seated, he was quick to offer up some drink recommendations and even quicker to input what we had selected into the computers. I ordered the BBQ wings and our group ordered a combination of platters, other flavors of wings and several types of drinks. I don't even think that 10 minutes passed before our food started arriving at our table. Out of all of our orders (there were 7 of us), Mark didn't even miss one thing... not even getting one of the orders of wing dry with the sauce on the side (you'd be surprised how many restaurants mess this little thing up). The entire time that we were waiting, Mark checked in on us a couple of times and always made sure to refill our waters. This was probably one of the few times that I haven't felt like I was dying of thirst before my server refilled me! As we ate, drank and caught up with each other, I could see that Mark wasn't just attentive to our table, but to everybody else's as well. Even when a customer complained that that she had received the wrong drink, he had no problem going right back up to the bartender and bringing back a correctly made (and probably stiff!) drink. A couple with a child came into the restaurant a short while after my group and Mark kindly asked us if we could scoot our two tables over to make room for this couple and their baby, which we did. In the end, my party was there for a few hours and the entire time, Mark never let our continuous calling of him to our table frustrate him or obstruct any aspect of his workflow. If all servers were as professional as he was, Applebee's would rake in the big bucks.  At the end of the day, I hope somebody from management sees this and rewards Mark or something! They'd be wrong to not do something for I will forever consider one of their best employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20,3.48,2.93,2.93,2.9000000000000004,3.1500000000000004

(Been always ordering the same thing.) All are delicious. Some days tastes better than others.  The wonton tacos would be the one thing that I recommend.

We asked for plastic cutlery (like the ones they give the take out orders) and even that had been previously opened. One bonus star to Larry who accommodated us and brought us another -unopened-set. When the beers finally arrived I noticed there was still lipstick marks on the rim and enough fingerprints to supply a lifetime of Clue games. Bartender was cool and swapped is for ""fresh"" new glasses... at this point we were ready to say screw it and leave, but Larry assured us and the food was already on it's way out.

I finish my food and then 5 extra minutes go by and final here comes his steak in the managers hands who just apologized. It was just the way he wanted it. So not  much to complain about right. So our 2 for $27 came with free brownie bites. So we ordered that to go because my daughter wanted to leave... btw shes 1 so yea she cant sit still for too long. We pay on the little machine. And 10 minutes went by... so i took my daughter outside to walk while my husband waited. We were outside for A good 5-7 minutes and still nothing. We went back inside and i just said ok lets just go it's ridiculous to wait for a brownie for over 15 minutes. I told the waitress were leaving. But she look confused and ran to the back and came out with our brownies and tiny sides of icecream. She apologized of course. But once i looked inside the bag seriously took over 15 minutes for a literal brownie bite and its also stone cold like all they had to do was bring it out of the fridge.

64,Adriana G.,"Eastvale, CA",64,123,222.0,4.0,2017-06-22,"Applebee's is a family staple, and having frequented quite a few across the state, this Eastvale location has proven to be one of the best.  Like many Applebee's, this restaurant is located in a shopping center - the Eastvale Gateway, to be exact.  Either before or after your meal, you can enjoy a Target run, grab some tech at Best Buy, shop the deals at Kohls or TJ Maxx, or catch the latest flick at the Regal theater just a few steps away.  Parking is generally adequate, however due to close proximity to a Carino's restaurant, it can get busy at peak ""eating out"" times (Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings).  Given its newness, the facilities feel updated and there have even been some minor furniture renovations in recent years.  The decor features the local culture of Eastvale, which is fun given that the city was incorporated in 2010. The menu is clear and easy to read, boasting a good variety of foods.  Something Applebee's gets right is the inclusion of calories with every menu item.  The definitely helps me make better dinner choices and I appreciate the gesture and wish more restaurants would do the same.  They frequently refresh their menu with rotating items and there are always a few good options regardless of your calorie intake.  There is even a smaller-portioned dessert - the brownie bite (360 cal) - for those who have a sweet tooth but don't want to waste a whole meal's worth of calories on it. Options for kids are pretty standard and they do offer healthier sides, although my children always opt for the fries. The service is usually great, and sometimes there are standouts, like Ginger who was extremely kind to me and my children this evening.   Overall, you can't go wrong with this Applebee's, although we do like to avoid the busiest times so as not to have to wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2,3.32,2.92,2.92,,3.08

So we got one next to the door. Boo! Lol. There were a couple other booths open but for some reason they wanted to give us the crappy tables. Oh well. We ordered drinks first which were Captain Bahama Mamas. They were really good. I didn't even taste alcohol in them, which must mean they're water down, because I hate the taste of alcohol, and most drinks are usually too strong for me. We also ordered one of the blue Hawaiian Long Island Iced Teas. I could taste a little alcohol in that one. It was a good drink though. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer. They give you a ton of chips and a tiny tiny bit of dip. The dip is very good though. Has a huge glob of mozzarella cheese on top, which I accidentally ate in one bite thinking it was a big piece of artichoke LOL. I ordered the barbecue brisket tacos. Those are pretty good. They had some crunchy fried onions on it, some salsa, and a little sauce. I added sour cream. You got three of them and they're good sized. They come with fries which were absolutely amazing. They are seasoned fries, and I loved them. And a tiny little thing of coleslaw, which was okay. Nothing special. Hubby got the six ounce steak with the fried mushrooms and onion, although they forgot the mushrooms and just put onion. And he added a butter sauce to it which was really yummy. It came with steamed broccoli and hashbrown casserole, which wasn't the best thing ever. Had an odd taste to it. It was nice inside. Super busy, but not super loud.

The manager comes over and says ""what can I do for you "" we told her the situation and she said the same thing as the waiter, I said it's not like that at the other Applebee's she said we are a separate entity and refused to give us a credit. Not exactly the way to keep people coming back to your restaurant. I will never go to this Applebee's again. In the future when someone orders off the happy hour menu during happy hour times they should be warned that they need to sit in the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2,2.72,2.89,2.89,,2.822
