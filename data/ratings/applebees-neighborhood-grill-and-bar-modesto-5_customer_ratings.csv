49,Kaylie W.,"Concord, CA",22,10,3.0,4.0,2012-11-04,"The rating is for the service we received by the manager.  As far as Applebees go, you can count on several things: the food will always taste the same and usually, the service is pretty bland. We ordered take out, and the guy who brought our food out was super friendly. We got home, opened up our food, and the steak that we had ordered well done was almost purple with how rare it was. It was missing several other key components as well, and we called up the restaurant. The manager and bartender took really good care of us when we came back in, and an entirely new order was up in less than ten minutes, a free dessert thrown in as well with everything else we wanted. Fantastic service for Applebee's standard.  For anyone used to five star food and service, go elsewhere: they messed up a very simple order and did what was right to fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=80,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.8960000000000004,2.04

When we were all in the process of leaving, the manager (Chris) approached our table accusing two of my co workers (that had already left) of not paying their tabs. He then began demanding that one of us cover their tabs.I explained to him that I saw both of the girls place cash in their bill folders before leaving. I also saw an Applebee's employee take the folders. I then got on the phone and called one of the girls who ended up coming back to Applebee's and paying both tabs AGAIN. The manager was extremely rude and had about three different stories of what he thought might have happened. On top of all this two different police men arrived who said not one word.

Went tonight with a friend to enjoy the late night happy hour.  Ordered one round of drinks (margarita and vodka cranberry); everything was good.  Second round, ordered two long islands.  Mine, upon first sip, tasted faintly of something chemical-ish (like a cleaning product).  I tried cleansing my palate and taking another sip; tasted the same as before.  I couldn't drink it at all.  Mind you, we've both been to this location before and have ordered their long island.  It has never tasted like what I had today before.  My friend agreed. We called the waiter over to ask about my drink, in which he then calls the manager.  Manager comes over explains that it is ""corporate policy"" that they cannot take a drink off the tab.  Ok, I'm not asking to take a drink of the tab; merely swap it out.  He said he could get me another drink, but I'll be charged for it.  Honestly, what kind of service is that?  You'd force your patron to pay for a drink that does even taste like it should?  A loss for one drink is better than a loss of customers.  And, Applebee's, you lost two customers today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=60,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.436,2.4

Applebee's is Applebee's. It's not my favorite restaurant chain, but I have never had a horrible experience either.  It is typically a 2-3 star option.

How do you serve a pasta dish so dry that it looks like rice? Our truck got broken into and all management had to say is ""it's that time of the year (xmas) and other customers have had the same problem too."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!

18,Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3794,2017,5538.0,3.0,2014-03-07,"Little known secret: I used to work at the Collinsville, IL Applebee's back in college. If you're ever driving through I-40 between IL and MO, you'll see it from the road. Sexy, huh? One would think that after seeing the same dishes over and over again (not to mention coming home smelling like it), that I would never want to eat at an Applebee's ever again. Not true, I do enjoy a visit to the neighborhood bar & grill every now and then. I especially like their mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Don't ask me why, I just do. While on a recent rural road trip, the +1 and I were deciding which chain restaurant should be our pit stop. Can you believe that he's never tried Applebee's?!? Everyone has to try it at least once... Just as I predicted, the joint was jumping on a Friday night! It really is a hotspot in small towns, and rightfully so since the food is relatively inexpensive and drinks pretty good. Seriously, I bet their perfect margarita would win in a blind tasting. The menu hasn't changed too much since the early 2000's. Which kinda makes it comforting, probably one of the main reasons why chains like Applebee's have stuck around all these years. People like to know what they're going to get, whether it's in Southern Illinois or Northern California. Our total bill for a steak, shrimp, salad and drinks was less than $40. Pretty sure nothing on our plates was locally sourced or craft anything, but it was salty and filling. And sometimes that's OK... assuming it's a ""once every few years"" sort of thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.732,2.68

The fish and chips were way too oily. The batter on the fish was bland, and my fries were cold. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp pasta, and it seriously looked like one of those frozen dinners from a bag. I've heard that Applebee's Turlock and Riverbank are a whole lot better when it comes to their food; unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the Applebee's Sisk location that I will not be returning to any of their restaurants because it would be a waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.148,3.0800000000000005

134,Chelsea E.,"Ripon, CA",2,11,41.0,1.0,2015-03-17,"Me and my husband came here and the server was very nice and he did a good job. Unfortunately the food was terrible.  They canceled my favorite entrée that I used to order and don't even have the ingredients to make it anymore. It was chicken fried chicken which was really really thin breaded chicken cooked perfectly, With homemade Redskin mashed potatoes that had so much flavor, Side of broccoli, and the best Gravy I've ever had. I am now a vegetarian but if they had that entrée I would get it once in a while because I loved it that much.  So my favorite entrées gone but we still decided to come anyway. And I just wanted to order the Redskin mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli. The Broccoli tasted like dirt very very bad. The mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor and they were so disgusting. My husband ordered a pasta dish which was pretty much the only thing he could order because he's also a vegetarian. Pasta dish tasted like something frozen that was  microwaved. And they gave him a garlic bread which was disgusting and I don't know how they messed up garlic bread because I am obsessed with garlic. But that seriously was the worst piece of bread I've ever had my life. And it was just pasta with the sauce no meat or anything and it was like $12!! We were regretting not going to Olive Garden instead.  We would've paid less and had better food! Also something I found very annoying was right when you walk in the host tells you can sit either in the bar and get appetizers half off or sit in the regular seating you don't get the discount. So we sat in the bar area. Now the host told us that all the appetizers were half off. So we pick 2-mozzarella sticks and onion rings. But when the waiter went to take our order for the appetizers it was so confusing even he was having a really difficult time and it wasn't his fault it's just the  new menus. Currently there's like four different menus for appetizers. And for some reason there's the half off appetizers in the bar area but onion rings isn't included in that. Which the host at the front door told us all the appetizers are half off. Then there's another menu which appetizers are two for seven dollars. But onion rings wasn't on that one either? So the waiter gave us mozzarella sticks and then substituted something for onion rings and rang us up for two orders of onion rings for $.50 each. It was very confusing and a hassle especially for the waiter. Waiter had to go put the order in and then come back to the table like five times to try to write up and charge correct amount for the appetizers ect.   I felt bad for him. because again it wasn't his fault.  Then for some reason to separate the bar and the dining area they hung up clear sheets and when we walked in I thought they were under construction because it doesn't look like curtains or anything it looks like they're hanging up plastic wrap for construction!! Overall I am very disappointed with Applebee's.  Before they made all these changes and took away my favorite entrée I tried to come here as much as possible because I absolutely craved that chicken fried chicken entrée. Now that it's gone I really don't think I will ever eat at Applebee's again.  Everything there tastes like some frozen crap that's been microwaved not worth your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.18,3.0400000000000005

He popped out of no where ready to clean it up and he even suggested the type of burger I should get and it was amazing.  The food was pretty good I've had better burgers but I am a burger person tho so I have a high standard and this burger was good enough for me to Like plus the fries were pretty good also.

44,Gerald E.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-10-02,"My wife ordered food online, to be picked up at the restaurant So I can't comment on that part. This is what happened from right after I walked in to pick up the order. When I got there, the hostess ignored me for a while, then had me wait, and then helped a couple who had just walked in. After she finished with the couple, I approached her and tried to make it more clear that I was still waiting for service. I told her that I needed to pick up the food that my wife had ordered. The hostess then told me that somebody would bring the food. I told her that it was ordered but not paid for, and she said not to worry. The person bringing the food would be bringing my receipt (receipt for unpaid for food?). Along came a young man holding my food, who apologized for taking so long. I told him not to worry, which was met with complaining from his end on how busy he is. ""This is just crazy, I've got so many orders going out."" He then handed me my food, which was quite a bit, filling both my hands with bag handles. Now that my hands are incapable of doing anything short of dropping the bags, the young man shows my a printout of how much I owe him and proceeds to wait. After a couple seconds, he realized that I couldn't pay him with my hands full. He said, ""Oh, I shouldn't have handed you all that"" and then offers to take a (1) bag. With one hand, I pulled out my wallet and slid my card out. I handed him the card in his free hand, and he gave me back the bag. Now my wallet is out because I didn't get a chance to put it away before he ran off. I waited for him to slide the card at his terminal and come back. After about five minutes of waiting on the act of sliding a card through a terminal, I decided that I would take the food out to my car and come back. This made me uncomfortable, as I didn't want to leave the premises without having paid for the food. After I came back from my car, the man came back to me, telling me that he ""had to redo everything"".  What is ""redoing""? I don't know. Why I couldn't have been informed that swiping a card was too hard for them, and they had to do it twice to get it right once? I don't know. After all of that, I signed for the charges and left (to the sound of the guy still complaining about how busy he is) I drove the 3 minutes it takes to get home, and ate stale, soggy fries. The cheeseburger was ok, at best. For dessert, I had ordered strawberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was curdled. At least I am guessing it was curdled. It looked curdled and tasted sour. Applebee's failed me on every step that I was involved in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,1.8600000000000003,2.92

I went here on a Saturday night and the quoted wait time was 15 minutes, but we were sat sooner which was awesome. However, our server didn't come take our drink order more than 5 minutes after we were sat. We weren't actually acknowledged until almost 10 minutes actually. We place our order and let him know which condiments we wanted as our dipping sauces for our mozzarella sticks and our onion rings. I ordered the oriental salad and my boyfriend ordered their American Standard burger with onion rings. We also ordered Mozzarella sticks as our app. When they brought out the mozzarella sticks we let the food runner know that we ordered them with ranch and asked if he could get us some. He said of course, but then we never saw him again. We had to hit the call server button on the tablet that they have on the tables. Finally our server came and we asked him for ranch and he later brought it out. He brought our food and I asked him for the dressings for the salad, but waited a little under 10 minutes for him to come back with them. He brought out my BF's burger that was overcooked, when he ordered it with some pink. The burger tasted like a MCD cheeseburger and was poorly thrown together. We had to call our server on the tablet twice more for napkins that were never given to us and our check. I wasn't offered a refill until after we paid our bill. I will not be coming back to this Applebees. Worst service ever!!! The salad was good, but the horrible service isn't worth it. The manager went to all the tables around us, but skipped our table.

41,Chris T.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,,1.0,2016-08-27,"Well. There's no option for zero stars, unfortunate when grading the Applebee's on Sisk rd. This was not our family's first trip to this location. We eat at this restaurant on average twice a month. I don't have much positive to say. Our visits and dining experiences here have been in constant decline. First, cleanliness, rather the lack thereof is profound. I would expect even a casual dining restaurant to have at least the basics of sanitation standards down. Not here by any means. The bathroom is dirty. Walls, floors, sink and countertops. Clearly there is little to no attention paid in at least the men's restroom. I cannot speak for the women's restroom. The sticky table tops, the dirty appetizer plates, the dirty flatware. It's truly bad. The 'water' ordered with a meal tastes more like a Clorox cocktail, every time. I'm sure they do not provide filtered water and if by some shred of a chance it is filtered, the company that services their beverage stations or Applebee's themselves should be embarrassed at the glasses of 'water' they serve their guests. When I send back the chlorinated water and dirty app plates I'm met constantly with a general malaise that is reflective of the overall service in general, never an apology or any real acknowledgement of the issues. I would like to pause to acknowledge the one quality server at the location, a very charming young lady, taller with short hair that has always handled business. Back to the grim reality. I haven't visited this location without witnessing a manager apologizing for some aspect of a patrons meal, sometimes multiple patrons on the same visit, anything from incorrect orders to and I quote an alcoholic beverage 'tasting of ammona.' The FLIES. Flies come from maggots, maggots are attracted to filth. The amount of flies in this restaurant is an atrocity. It's easy to understand why this place is full of flies due to the grime and filth. I can't imagine what the kitchen and back of house must look like. I didn't mention anything to staff at our last visit, which will in fact be our LAST visit. I didn't want the manager to come comp some part of my check, that's not what this is about. I want to like Applebee's, my kids enjoy Applebee's, but I also don't want food poisoning, disentary, or some other microbial infection for my family or myself. I hope somehow this review can begin a process of change for this store. That will not be possible until the very basic tenets of a properly run dining establishment are met. I rescind the 1 star I was forced to give Applebee's on Sisk rd. I give zero stars, I find it truly unbelievable how this establishment is allowed to continue in this fashion.

The waitress noticed and provided free chips and salsa! I'd easily go there again. I enjoyed my healthy food, but there was a bit more greasy food on other's plates- like the sandwiches had 'buttered' toast.

2,Helen M.,"Modesto, CA",22,5,1.0,2.0,2017-07-23,Ordered the steak southwest salad and the steak was tough and chewy. The worst was the salad greens that were wet with some type of dressing mixed in with shredded yellow cheese and thin tortilla strips. I got old lettuce that was turned dark on the edges and the whole salad part was one mushy pile. I brought it to the attention of my waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders. I'm pretty sure I won't ever be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20,1.6,2.53,2.53,,2.1580000000000004

99,Len Len S.,"Tolleson, AZ",6,9,35.0,2.0,2017-09-18,"Came to eat up after a long day at the mall with a friend!  Got a whisky bacon burger, bourbon street chicken and shrimp, plus 3 appetizers (boneless wings, wonton tacos, and mozzarella sticks.) it was the 2 for $20 so we thought why not split.  Our server was great, she was so nice! She didn't mind us being loud haha.  - So the whisky bacon burger was..... ok.... nothing special about the meat at all. The only flavor I really got was from the bacon, but the whisky sauce that it came with was REALLY overpowering, like a weird BBQ taste. I took one bite and couldn't finish the rest.  - the bourbon street chicken was something left to desire; The shrimp was so tiny but it came with garlic butter and it really was packed with flavor. The chicken  Was so juicy and tender but it was TINY! Literally the size of my palm. There's no way I would have been able to get full with just that. Lastly, the potatoes that came with it were flavorless and dry. so I would probably skip on this.  The appetizers were jut plain old appetizers to me, the only stand out thing to me was the wonton tacos! The chicken seating is questionable and was a little cold but as soon as the coleslaw hit the tastebuds it just.... made sense! Seriously so bomb. I'm kind of mad they only gave us three!  Peach tea tasted like green tea with peach syrup, so there's that for you guys.  Don't think I'll be coming again very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5,1.8,2.5,2.5,,2.22

When we arrived we were told it was a 25 minute wait to eat at the Applebee's. We waited for approximately 30 and went to check in and be sure we had not been skipped. Matter of fact we actually had... When inquired with the manager she said that they had called our name ... we had been sitting within ear shot but our name was never been called. Perhaps there was a mixup of names. Either way there was absolutely no effort to correct the mistake and we were told that her weight has now been extended to 45 minutes. There is a terrible example of customer service, and absolutely no effort to rectify the situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5,1.96,2.45,2.45,,2.2540000000000004

I'm honestly surprised by the number of complaining reviews. I've even been here when we have to wait because it was a busy time and find it far more pleasant than the waits we've experienced elsewhere. Applebees has great Honey Mustard, I always get some if I have fries! My only qualm is that I always ask not to be seated on the Sisk side of the restaurant. For some reason, the way noise gets amplified is overly irritating to the ear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5,2.08,2.46,2.46,,2.308

109,Justin v.,"Long Beach, CA",1,5,,1.0,2017-11-12,"Just came here w my son. We ordered an appetizer and waited 20min for it to come out cold, we get are food 10min after that. By the time my food got there I had no drink and I asked the waitress to get me a refill and 20min go by and still no refill, she comes back to my table twice still haven't gotten me a refill and still hasn't brought my kids milk shake that we ordered when we first got here. So let me sum it up appetizer cold, fries w meal cold, shake brought at the end of meal and I had to go the bar to get my own refill after 30min of waiting for a refill! This place sucks and I'm so pissed I wasted 40 to go out to eat w my son here ohh and by the way they charge you for using the games on the tablets but hey don't tell you they just quietly add it to the check and hope you won't notice the $2.00 fee",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5,1.96,2.49,2.49,,2.2780000000000005

98,Halley P.,"Gridley, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-07,"A couple days ago, I had a good day. I went to my classes, I passed an exam, and I did some online shopping for Christmas presents. A couple friends wanted to hang out so, I mean, of course I obliged! We went to the mall, walked around for a bit, did a little more shopping, and worked up quite the hunger. (Note: This is when mistakes were made) We decided on Applebee's because of the location, affordable prices, and the Monday burger deal ($7.99 burgers and fries).  I am quite the bacon connoisseur (not really...I just love bacon) so I got the triple bacon cheeseburger. It. Was. Delicious.  The cheese was gooey, the patty was juicy and NOT pink, the bacon was crispy. It was overall quite good. I said goodbye to my friends, headed home, went to bed, and woke up for class the next morning.  An hour into my class, I felt some gastrointestinal distress. I am lactose intolerant so I am no stranger to this, but it was different this time. I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I sat there for nearly triple the amount of time a bathroom break should take. I finished up, went back to class, started to die inside, then eventually left the class to (unbeknownst to me at the time) SIT IN THE BATHROOM, DYING, FOR 90 MINUTES.  After the intense diarrhea and nausea, and after the toilet seat imprint felt like a permanent body modification, I tried to drive home. I ended up pulling over multiple times to regurgitate my dinner from 10 hours ago. I spent my entire day in a repetitive circle of vomit and diarrhea because Applebee's does NOT STORE THEIR MEAT PROPERLY. I know I don't have E. coli because that takes a couple days to arise, and I am not a medical professional, but this restaurant did not follow food safety protocol.  Either they let their beef patties sit at room temperature for too long, only to be frozen and reheated later and served to an unknowing guest, or their staff does not wear gloves/wash their hands/who knows. I cannot go back in time and ask, nor can I change the past. But I can let the fellow food-eaters who look at these Yelp reviews know about this location and the food they serve.  If you enjoy being in gastrointestinal distress, by all means, go here and enjoy a cheeseburger. --Management will be contacted--",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5,1.96,2.45,2.45,,2.2540000000000004
