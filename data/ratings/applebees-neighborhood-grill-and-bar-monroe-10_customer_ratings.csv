13,Laura W.,"Monroe, GA",0,7,43.0,2.0,2012-08-14,"I won't be going back here. The service is always terrible. Bartender took forever to take my drink order. And when I finally got my drink, it was weak. Too sweet and hardly any alcohol. Standard should be a 1 ounce pour but it was not even that. Food tasted like frozen food cooked that I could have easily bought at the grocery store. Not to mention it took about 20 minutes to even get my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
19,S R.,"Buford, GA",0,4,,1.0,2013-05-12,I have been to this restaurant twice since it has been open and both time they always mess something up.  Today was the third time and the service has a lot to be desired. They have lost my business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
15,Tim C.,"Monroe, GA",0,20,,1.0,2014-10-26,"Have eaten here several times. The service is terrible but that figures ...so is most of the food. Stick with a Monday $5.00 burger anything else is boiled/nuked  in a bag that was prepared miles away at a commissary. Always seem to wait forever to have a wait person make their initial appearance , then another 10-15 minutes before your drinks arrive...even getting the bill takes forever. If you must eat here, order a $5.00 burger and sit at the BAR where you can at least see a member of staff most of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
14,Kim W.,"Bethlehem, GA",0,1,,1.0,2015-01-10,"Service was awful and so slow.  Empty tables all over and was told we had to wait 20 minutes, then after seated the waitress waited on others seated after us before she ever came to us.  Food was terribly slow coming out too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
17,Ronald S.,"Good Hope, GA",1,16,3.0,2.0,2015-02-08,"Ok has this Applebees' standards slipped or were they always this bad & I just never paid attention?  Our first disappointment was being introduced to our table...mess of food and garbage on the floor right next to our table and we had to step over it. What has happened to American dining?  It seems to have become common practice for servers to wipe off a table and just let garbage lay wherever it falls.  Worse yet, customers don't complain.  Had a manager been present I would have commented but it was soon very obvious that there was no management there that night.  We were served our drinks, a wine and a margarita. Glasses were gritty feeling to the touch..yuck were they clean? My wine glass had red wine slopped all over the base...I had to wipe it off myself.  We were not offered or served any water and it took a while before our order was taken.  As we waited for our food we noticed a bartender and a waitress standing at the end of the bar sharing a meal.  It seemed a bit too casual for them there dining in plain view of all customers, chatting, wiping their mouths and then pouring drinks.  Then we noticed they were both eating out of one Styrofoam to go box....two forks and one box.  It was just kind of gross like two pigs eating out of one trough...couldn't they have done that in the back at least, out of sight?  Our Caesar salads arrived...cold salads on some very hot plates...oh well...no big deal I suppose but it shows they do not pay attention to detail.  Our dinners were quite good...steaks and baked potatoes.  The steaks were cooked properly and the potatoes were done well too...very tasty.  Young wait staff was everywhere and most were working hard and seemed attentive to their customers but with no manager in sight, things were not well coordinated and some were slacking.  Meanwhile food and garbage was left laying on the floor.  I searched for a manager all night but there was none to be had so I left my feedback on YELP.  I guess Gordon Ramsey has spoiled my dining out because he's made me aware of important little details and how poorly management sometimes is when it comes to cleanliness and service.  Applebees, you could be doing a lot better...you get a D+ at best from this customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
11,Bill B.,"Atlanta, GA",62,104,81.0,3.0,2015-09-06,"Well haven't been to one of these joints in a while,  but the service was good the food not like it use to be.Had the burbon steak lost a lot of flavor the drinks were good rest of my fam said there dish was pretty good. Good stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
16,Tara B.,"Monroe, GA",0,3,,1.0,2015-10-11,This place is a poor excuse a restaurant. I ordered a salad to go 11.00 salad that comes in a side salad container I asked where the rest of it was and then Bartender gets an attitude. Then dumps the salad in a bigger container. Still a side salad for 11.00 no thanks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
9,Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227.0,2.0,2016-04-17,"Stopped by to grab a quick lunch on our way back from the race. Our server was as nice as could be but the food was the disappointment of visit. They apparently had just gotten a new truck load of food in, which meant that the spinach and artichoke dip was out of the question because it was still frozen and would not thaw out enough for another 45 minutes. Initially, when she told us that the truck just came in, I thought, ""Cool! That means we'd have extra fresh food!"" but it turned out to be the opposite. Good variety of food options and the prices were fair. There are cheap lunch options under $10 (choose two: soup, salad, entree) for one person or you can choose between $20 and $25 options (one appetizer and two entrees) if you split with someone else. If one person chooses from the $20 option and the other chooses from the $25, they'll actually just charge you the difference of $22.50 instead of charging for the higher price. The appetizers we received were just okay and the pasta I ordered was bland - not even pepper and hot sauce could make it better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
12,Melissa F.,"Loganville, GA",16,3,,2.0,2016-05-09,No steak knives for the three steaks we ordered. Steak had no flavor. They forgot some of our food. No ketchup for the fries for our kids. Food was just not worth what we paid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
7,Brittany M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,12,,1.0,2016-08-18,"This has the be the worst place I have ever been. Our server Terri continued to make mistakes with our order, never came back to the table, and worst of all was so incredibly rude. When my sons lunch didn't come out and mine was cold, we asked to see a manager. Sierra, the manager, was the worst part of the entire experience. She acted like we were unconvincing her and that we should just pay for food we never ate and leave. It goes without saying- we will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
2,Regina M.,"Atlanta, GA",195,72,101.0,1.0,2016-08-21,"If I could give it a zero I would. We met friends here for a late night bite when they came through town- not much in options open in Monroe after 9p.  Worst service,  and the food might as well have come out of frozen food bags. I will take them to Huddle or Waffle House before ever coming back. Seriously - as a chain the standard is sinking into oblivion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
10,Sarah P.,"Monroe, GA",0,7,,1.0,2016-09-20,"This is probably the worst Applebees that I've ever visited. The place is old, dirty, and the food is terrible. This was our second time at this restaurant, and it will be our last. The first time the food was just ok, but the service was bad, and we had some issues with them charging our credit card twice. Corporate sent us some coupons to use as an apology. We finally decided to give it another go but WOW what a mistake! It took forever to get drinks, our waitress was odd and didn't like making eye contact and would disappear for long periods of time. The soup we ordered was so greasy I couldn't even eat it. The boneless wings were good but how hard is it to mess up deep fried chicken? The main course was bland and tasted old, and the quality of the food was questionable. They should consider closing this place down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
8,Scott S.,"Conyers, GA",7,1,,1.0,2016-10-19,"Why isn't there an option to give this sh*thole a zero, y'know? I like steak, but the chef here has no idea as to how to make anything less than rubber, I wanted a f*cking medium rare steak with fries. Instead I got a slab of rubber with some salty burnt sticks, f*ck they even forgot to give me a fork, so I had to wait 20 minutes before i could even try my slab o' rubber.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
6,J M.,"Augusta, GA",0,3,3.0,1.0,2017-01-22,Very poor sevice unless one is a favored ethnic group. Rude clientele. Ignored by servers at the bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
5,Tim C.,"Dacula, GA",1,36,1.0,1.0,2017-02-12,"Terrible service, no, much worse than that. Food that arrives at your table frequently is NOT what you ordered. Inordinately long wait for service and food. Just not worth it! We've started going to the Bethlehem location which is much, much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
1,Brian H.,"Monroe, GA",0,42,15.0,4.0,2017-05-20,"Hey everyone,  Im here again at another place. Applebees at best is hit or miss.  The franchise in Monroe Ga is about the same as all the rest with the exception of the bar area. Missie is one of the best in the industry.This is what sets this particular Applebees apart from all the rest.  Lets be honist, Applebees is not really cooking. You need to have people skills when you dont have cooking talent. I would invite you to a warm and friendly environment made possible by a majority of the wait staff at this location.  Now for the food... Like I said hit or miss..what do you expect? It is never bad but its just not great. BTW im very spoiled as I have been privileged to many of Atlanta's best resturants. There is no shame in a 4 star for this location. Made excellent by missie and the others on staff. Thank you Monroe Applebees!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
4,Tara S.,"Atlanta, GA",18,16,6.0,2.0,2017-07-03,"I would not recommend eating at this location. Every time that we have eaten there, the service was not the best, and our orders were messed up. Also, our food came out a different times, and was not very hot, nor did it taste very fresh. For the price of the food, you could go to a lot better restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
3,Lori E.,"Athens, GA",4,64,1.0,1.0,2017-07-28,Service is terrible. Drinks let empty multiple times. When asked for sauce was told it had to be requested in the kitchen and would take a while. And it did. Med steak was cooked to dry. Noodles were dry and stuck together. Salad was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-10,,,,,
