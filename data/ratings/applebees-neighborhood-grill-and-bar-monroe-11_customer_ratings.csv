17,Sean A.,"Monroe Charter Township, MI",0,18,,2.0,2013-10-30,"The food is always good here.  The staff sucks. I could hear the cooke complain from the back that they were mad they had to cook for us when we came in at night. One of the waitresses was rude and made the entire meal uncomfortable, even from across the room.  Very very childish. For that fact I will never return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
22,Derek H.,"Ida, MI",0,9,3.0,1.0,2014-02-02,It took forever to get our food. 400 teenagers sat right next to us and were talking as if they were front row at a  Jonas brothers concert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11?start=20,,,,,
11,Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324.0,2.0,2014-08-19,"My family and I stopped here for late night dinner after being in the car for over five hours. Let's face it: there's not too many restaurants that are open around 10pm on a weeknight. For a restaurant that always advises 'open until midnight or later' I feel as though they should expect a late night crowd and be able to handle the business. The restaurant was pretty dead when we strolled in. The hostess was cleaning menus while texting on her phone and said somebody will be right with us. At least she acknowledged us, right? After a few minutes she sat us at a nearby table.  We got our drinks and food orders sent in at a reasonable time. Just the wait to get our food took over 45 minutes. This seems to be a common issue for every Applebee's I have ever been to. Perhaps hire more help for late night shifts? Thank goodness for the fast wifi! The food was typical. Lukewarm and average. Nothing to write home about. Place was dirty and waitstaff just chilled talking to one another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
19,Kathy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,22,7.0,5.0,2014-12-21,"This is the best Applebees in Southeast Michigan! The servers are always smiling.  The manager comes around to check on your meal and best of all,  the food is delicious! The location makes is very convenient when shopping because it's near Kohls, the Mall,  Hobby Lobby, and other stores. We had Jacqueline as a server.  Ask for her,  she's great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
21,Jessica P.,"Monroe, MI",1,2,,3.0,2014-12-22,I come here weekly we jus love it always get the same thing today I asked my server for a second order of fries with my burger and she said since u wanted it plain id have to get a basket appetizer so we had to skip out on dessert maybe next time I guess,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11?start=20,,,,,
12,Alan B.,"Monroe, MI",0,5,1.0,4.0,2015-02-13,Boneless angel wings coated in the tears of Christ himself. With onion rings that make a grown man cry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
20,Tom R.,"Monroe, MI",1,17,,3.0,2015-02-20,"I had the American Standard Hamburger. The idea of having all your toppings inside the burger sounds good at first....but it really isn't. Couldn't taste any of them. I had to request pickles, onion, tomato to put on it, after eating about a third of it. The burger was a lot smaller then I thought it would be for $9.99 and I had minimal fries with the order. My wife had the Napa Chicken and Portobello. I was very envious as I could smell and see the food. Had a taste of it and it was VERY good. Service was ok, but not great, as I had to almost get refills on pop myself after the initial one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11?start=20,,,,,
18,Jenny D.,"Luna Pier, MI",29,52,1.0,4.0,2015-03-22,"Delicious! Great dinner night out with the family. Or server was pleasant. Food was good. Kitchen was a bit slow tonight, but that's OK. Loved the free offer for checking in. Got the new smore churros. Holy cow delicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
13,James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347.0,2.0,2015-06-20,"Applebee's is just okay. Have never been really impressed. Usually avoid any Applebee's, because the wait for your food seems sooo long. However, otherwise service is usually pretty good. The blondie is the best thing on the menu? They are definitely on the bottom of my big chain restaurants list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
16,Riley G.,"Milan, MI",0,1,,5.0,2015-09-19,"The entire meal was great, but there was some slightly ""questionable"" wings. The manager was EXTREMELY understanding and made up for it! Super helpful staff who genuinely care that you have a great meal. Will definitely be back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
15,R R.,"Richland, WA",0,12,5.0,4.0,2015-09-26,Sat at the bar. Mindy is awesome. Some of the best customer service I've had. Food was quick and correct. And the beer was cold and refreshing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
10,Billy L.,"Monroe, MI",0,247,2.0,2.0,2015-12-01,"Applebee's used to be a go-to place when you couldn't decide what you wanted to eat and didn't want to pay too much. The selection was broad and the prices were decent. However, it seems the menu keeps shrinking (or at the least has less variety) and the prices go up. I guess that's how things go. My recent trip was quite the disappointment. The clubhouse grille, a favorite of mine, is no longer like it was. Doesn't even come close to looking like the picture on their own website. The bread was soggy, almost no meat, way too much lettuce, and hardly any sauce. Service at this location is hit and miss, with this last time here being a bit of a miss. I'm guessing for how the waitress was acting, she was ready to go home and wanted us out as soon as possible. This hasn't been true in the past, though, so perhaps it was just a one-time disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
14,J P.,"Ypsilanti, MI",8,59,,1.0,2016-01-07,Every time I go here I regret it. I keep going back hoping it will be better than the last time..it's a bad romance. Everything sucks here...from steaks to burgers to dried out pastas and completely imperfect margaritas. Warm beer. Crappy service. Broken electronic tabletop menus. Half off apps after 9pm is the only reason anyone eats here. And all of the appetizers suck too. SUCK SUCK THIS PLACE SUCKSSSSSSSS,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
8,Dave S.,"Monroe, MI",127,222,399.0,3.0,2016-10-05,"Good food. Portions have become smaller and hit and miss on service. Use to love going here but to many better places with better portions, prices and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
2,Mitch J.,"White Lake, MI",0,12,2.0,1.0,2017-03-05,"Stopped in last night around 5:15 understanding there would a wait, but not expecting the chaos we encountered.  The waiting area was packed full of people, which is somewhat expected on Saturday night, but not when there was ample seating to immediately seat 20 and more. The staff displayed their incompetency by hiding in the back with Brian, the manager, while we waited 20 minutes before the staff returned to seat people.  Our waitress was exceptional and the food was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
5,Katie H.,"Monroe, MI",16,17,3.0,1.0,2017-03-17,"Service tonight was mediocre.....the waitress was mad that we came in an hour before closing and made it known. Our food was ok my shrimp was very over cooked and cold. Our appetizer, the NEW nachos were not impressive to say the least. The one thing that really upset our table was that manager was very unprofessional, a waitress was sitting at a table with what looked to be people she knew and the manager yells from by the bar at her to come here and then yells again when she didn't hear him. Then proceeded to correct her in front of everyone and question her it was ridiculous. Over all felt rushed and annoyed the whole time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
7,Chelvia H.,"Belleville, MI",1,3,1.0,3.0,2017-04-05,"Typically, I only pick from a couple of different entrees at Applebee's.  Not my fav food/place but we go occasionally because it's in a convenient location.  Went there after Church last Sunday and tried something new, Honey Pepper Mac N' Cheese.  Not a fan.  I like my bacon crispy and this dish came loaded with tiny pieces of chewy bacon thoughout the cheese sauce. Not to mention, please refrain from chopping the parsley - makes it extremely hard to pick off.  The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is for our waitor, TJ.  He was very friendly, attentive and helpful.  The food gets 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
9,Jason L.,"Westland, MI",0,1,,1.0,2017-04-23,"This is my first review and I was not pleased with the service and management. Not to mention the restaurant was invested with ants. At first we did not realize it until it was time to leave, but the ants were inside the crevices of the seat cushions. I mean hundreds.  Had to ask the server for everything. Refills, straws, correct check, etc.  We told the manager about the ants and we were given 2 free appetizers for future use. Glad we don't live near there, because we will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
6,Susan A.,"South Rockwood, MI",5,7,4.0,1.0,2017-04-28,"What a bad experience here.  No cheese for first entree, so second entree was artichoke spinach chicken cavatappi, No artichoke! Small or half of a chicken breast on top of dry pasta. I was so disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
4,S W.,"Monroe, MI",1,21,,5.0,2017-09-21,Applebee's in Monroe is a decent chain restaurant. Their specials are priced excellent. I have never had a bad meal there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,
1,Kate B.,"Monroe, MI",100,737,1207.0,4.0,2017-11-26,"We stopped here after power shopping because I got a coupon in the Swag Bag from the mall. But I didn't need it, because you can check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer. I got the steak quesadilla and my sister got the Thai shrimp salad. We both got drinks and cheered making it thru Thanksgiving weekend, with a Friendsgiving thrown in! We had been rocking and rolling all weekend and were powering down. Our server was great-he was a pro and kept things moving. We played the tableside game and had a great time. Sorry there are no pics, we ate too fast!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-monroe-11,,,,,

0,Jaime B.,"South Rockwood, MI",10,4,3.0,5.0,2018-01-10,Hostess was friendly. Melissa is very friendly upbeat and nice. We love coming here. The food is awesome and 1/2 off appetizers after 8pm!!!
