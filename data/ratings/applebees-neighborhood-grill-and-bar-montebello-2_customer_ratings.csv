242,Yvonne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2.0,1.0,2012-01-05,"My friends and I came here for our monthly ""girls dinner"" and I have been here several times before (and I actually enjoy coming) but not this time. They sat us in the corner behind a short wall and forgot about us, finally after 15 min I got up and asked who our waiter/waitress was and finally after I complained they moved us and the ""manager"" came and took our drink orders. Of course they forgot one drink (alcoholic beverage) and when I asked the ""manager"" about it he seemed to be bothered and made a face. We finally ordered after 35 min of being there, they must of changed our waiter 3 times. So VERY DISSATISFIED with the service here and wont be returning for a long time. Needless to say one of my friends called the district manager and he seemed not remorseful at all stating they were doing inventory....ok? so what does that have to do with your paying customers?  so she proceeded to call corporate and whoopie.... we will receive 6-$10 gift card which pays for half of our $120 bill that night.....I'm sticking to B.J.'s across the way!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2?start=260,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.116,2.16
49,Vince V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",592,1310,4323.0,3.0,2012-04-30,"How long has it been since I ate a Blondie. A Tupac hologram would say, ""All I need in this life of sin, is me and my Blondie"" Stevie Wonder may sing about his ""Blondie Amor"" and even Prince may say this desert is the most Blondieful desert in the world. I see many low ratings for this establishment and many Apple Bees but I think it is because people come here for the food, don't! This store has very relaxed seating, dim lighting, plenty of televisions with sports on and an enclosed sense of privacy. It is very clean and presentable. I never had an Apple Bees entrée or side which really impressed me but I do like their Blondie desert. Sometimes, when I go to a restaurant I think, I am not here for the food. This was no exception, I was only here to pick up a desert, customer service was quick, friendly, efficient and my consumer experience was pleasant. Parking was decent, near 60 fwy, only two curbside spots, no biggie. The Blondie to go was not as good as the softer, warmer and moister Blondie you get when you eat inside, I took it out to go. Still, I ate it in my office and enjoyed the sweet flavor. No matter how many times I eat a Blondie I never get bored of it much like what Hi-Five thought of performing and creating music back in 1991. Song parody of Hi-Five's 1991 hit song ""Kissing Game"" All winter long I've loved your flaxen And it always taste so good Cause when I eat you You're such a good time (yes it is) And when I eat, ecstasy You make my heart beat fast You break me with your golden smile When your blonde is shown So smooth live a dove And I can't get enough  (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day You taste so good Even better with cream My Blondie dreams Desert is our time This was not meant to be Just you and me Make me feel new So young in heart My Blonde dream come true Like a flaxen glare I love your sweet flair (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day Yeah (I like the) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day  (I like the) Blondie day  (I like the) Oh I like (I like the way) The way you make me feel, blondie (I like the way) The way you make me feel, blondie  (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game  (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day I like (I like you) the way I eat you like I'm playing an eating game I like (I like it) the way (You keep me looking forward to Blondie day) I like the way (repeat till fade",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2?start=120,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.444,2.16

The manager Fernando went around to all the table to make sure all the customers were being taking care of. He came over to our table sharing good laughs well needed for the bad i was having and he was saying how he had been there since 11 am and was gonna be off at 10 that night not even realizing that it was already 1030.

256,D C.,"Whittier, CA",0,9,,1.0,2012-10-20,"My family and I tried our first experience at Applebee's and it was a very unpleasant one. We first got seated, our orders was taken. All of our order came EXCEPT my wife's. The waitress said her food will be coming soon. Our children ate BUT I refused to eat my food until they bring my wife's food. 10 minutes passed and still nothing, 20 minutes passed and nothing. All awhile I sat in front of my food NOT eating looking angry, our waitress not even once bothered checking up on us not EVEN the assistance manager who was passing by us at least 3 times did not bother asking how we are doing.  Clearly everyone around us was looking at me BECAUSE I wasn't eating my food. We stat in the middle of the restaurant so it looks very obviously what was going on. Our waitress was just standing and talking to her co-worker. Finally after 30 minutes my wife ask the waitress ""where is our food?"", 5 minutes later she brought our food, but my food already got cold, and we told them we're leaving.  The waitress had made an excuse and blaming the chef for not getting the food out earlier. My biggest peeve about this is the assistant manger saw us and NOT once asked us how we're doing ESPECIALLY since I refused to eat my food without my wife eating her's.

232,Lee N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,12,,4.0,2012-10-22,"Visited here after a tennis match.  My friend recommended it despite the bad yelp reviews.  We ordered off the low calorie menu.  I had the garlic sirloin steak (medium).  She and my wife had the parmesan chicken.  Both dishes were outstanding.  I would just let the savor the beef as long as I could in my mouth before I even started chewing.  It was that good. Unfortunately, the reviews were somewhat correct about the service staff.  They were very inattentive.  I know it's probably a min. wage job.  But, it seemed like they just liked to hang out at the reception area and chat instead of pay attention to the customers.  In other words, it didn't feel like they wanted to be there. HOWEVER, the (new?) manager seemed like he was really trying his best and we had a nice conversation as he was taking our order.  In fact, when I walked towards the restroom, I noticed him trying to get the staff back in line with a stern (not screaming) voice when we mentioned the lack of service from the staff.  I kind of felt sorry for him.

We came into Apple bees around 7:30pm. We where a party of 12. We just wanted to have dinner with the family, they told us the wait would be around 40mins since they where busy. We said thats fine. An hour later I asked if our table was going to be ready soon since I seen partys of 2-5 being seated and they waited 20-30mins. They said they where waiting for tables to clear so they could combine two together since it was a big family, they also said some where paid for and I asked myself arent we paying customers, I found that very offensive. After 1:18 I asked to speak to the manager and asked for the name, they immidately said that our table was ready and they walked us to the table. After sitting in the table they did not take our order until another 10min. I didnt care about the 10mins but we had already waited 1hr 18minutes, plus another 10mins that made it 1hour and 28mins waiting to get food, mind you after taking our order we did not end up receiving our food for another 15-20mins, that almost made it 2 hours that we waited to get served. The waitress was was very attentive but after waiting that long, I left with a sour taste in my mouth. I will definately not go back. THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! after requesting to speak to the manager (Jim) he was a NO SHOW! the service is a reflection of the Manager and it trickles all the way down to all employees.

My gf has already vowed never to come back and I agree. Every visit I had a different server and from the moment I ordered my Dos XX It took a long time to get it! 7- 9 minutes! The first time the server didn't bring me a lime wedge and I wasn't able to request one from her because when I received the Dos XX she passed by my table quickly and just dropped off the pilsner. I drank half of my Dos XX until I was able to get the server to bring a lime wedge. The menu is pretty simple Applebee's sells burgers, pastas, sandwiches, steaks, and salads. I always ordered the Cowboy burger and I can't say it was anything special. Both of my first visits I didn't receive the burger they way I wanted it and on the third visit the meat wasn't fresh. If a manager doesn't visit your table you receive a $10.00 certificate good for the next visit. The manager does pass by but he isn't very friendly and isn't professionally dressed. All three times the same man visited my table and just asked if everything was ok. On the first visit my gf ordered her steak medium well and received it well done. The second visit she ordered the cowboy burger and received raw onions and tomato when she told the server she didn't want them and the third visit she ordered the steak again but wow oh wow it took 23 minutes to receive our plates. Her steak was nice and fresh but my plate wasn't. Plus the margaritas are weak.

I ordered some low calorie chicken entree and the description didn't live up to the actual dish. Gross and tasteless rice that was laced with soggy canned mushrooms and lets not forget the wilted spinach that was buried underneath. The chicken was ok and the only thing I ate just because I was hungry.

We had to keep reminding our food server about our order. On one occasion, we asked for A1 sauce and 10 minutes past by with no A1 sauce delivered! Instead, my dad got up from the table and asked the host for A1 sauce, in which the host immediately obtained the sauce from the room right to the left of the entrance! 10 minutes after my dad got the A1 sauce, the food server brings the sauce and says, ""I had to walk the entire restaurant to get this sauce."" So what she's telling me is that it takes 20 minutes to walk the small-sized restaurant to get the ""only"" bottle of A1 sauce for the entire restaurant? The food was still warm when it came came but got cold really quick because we were eating right under the AC vent. Not once did the server come to see what else we needed. I had to call her to get napkins and refills for our drinks. You can tell that this particular Applebee's has not received a visit from the Fire Marshall in a while because they have put their customers and employees' safety at risk by blocking 2 of their emergency exits on the main floor with 2 dining tables. The only people that would be safe in an emergency would be the people sitting directly in front of the emergency exit door. The people sitting on the other side of the table would have to push the table and chairs out of the way to try to exit. Come to think about it, i would have had to do that that Sunday night if there was an emergency because I was sitting on the other side if the table that was blocking one of the emergency exits, along with my wife and my 2 year old son!!!

My boyfriend and I are BIG eaters, and this plate is soooo good that we don't even mind the small portions. The Roma Pepper Steak is amazing - and I'm picky. It's small but thick, and I've had it a three different locations with no problem. It's so tender and juicy, and the tomato REALLY compliments the flavor. The potatos are great, simple with some herbs on them, and a large portabello mushroom filled with some kind of cheesy spinach artichoke filling. SO GOOD! For soups ... the tomato basil soup is decent, could be creamier, but it does the job. I personally like the corn chowder topped with cheese and tortilla chip strips.

Randomly dropped in with my beau on a Thursday night, to our enjoyment it turns out to be karaoke night, which is enjoyable within itself. As we look around we se a great number of intoxicated patrons of whom should have been cut off a loooong time beforehand. To our surprise, we see what could have been a drunk waitress partaking in karaoke and actually sitting at a table with highly intoxicated patrons.  Next issue, I'd say there was a 1 to 4 ratio of ""cholos"" who were highly highly intoxicated and appeared to have issues with a handful of different guests and employees.  Understandably you get this anywhere but at this particular time we felt very unsafe and out of our element.  Nonetheless. Food was delightful as always, service was good a slight negligence due to the high census (apparently) a few delays in beverage refills and initial food entry.

46,Abe B.,"Pico Rivera, CA",2,17,2.0,1.0,2015-04-07,"I rarely give out low ratings because I usually like to spread the good word of a place that I've enjoyed. One of my pet peeves about Yelpers is handing out 1 star because they weren't treated like royalty. Because a waitress didn't smile enough or because the food didn't come out fast enough. Know where you are and where you're dining.  With that said, I'd like to give a fair warning about this place. On one trip, me and a couple of friends stopped by for a drink. We went to the bar area which was virtually empty and sat at a table. We watched waitress after waitress pass by without acknowledgement,  okay no big deal, I'm a patient guy. They must be busy, right? So we went up to the bartender and ordered our beers which he promptly served us. ""Thanks Dude"" we pay him and we return to our table. Still no waitress comes to us or acknowledges us but the manager certainly did make her presence known. In an almost a scolding manner she explained that we cannot order drinks from the bar then sit at the tables, that the waitresses were to serve us. It was so ackward even the bartender gave us a look like ""Sorry dudes. I didnt know either."" Were we depriving the waitresses of tips by helping ourselves because the barkeep got his? Like I said I rarely complain about service but don't treat people like vagabonds that came in to sully your establishment. Needless to say we left shortly after that. One a second trip, to be fair was at a different location: We had gift cards we wanted to use so against my better judgement gave it a another chance. As we walk in, we headed to the  empty bar but someone stepped right in front of us and stopped us and said they were expecting a big party and we had to sit in the dining area. Fine. Well we waited patiently, got seated and eventually were served our bland tasteless food. Before paying out our bill we noticed the bar was still as empty as before. We asked the waitress about the large party they were expecting and she said they weren't expecting any large parties that she knew of. Hmmmm not cool. Applebees will certainly survive without out my patronage but last time ever, anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2?start=120,3.0,2.55,2.55,1.924,2.7300000000000004

Once again after a long wait my husband and I both decided to go up to the front to pay for our meal, the hostess was nice enough to track her down and handed her my credit card. Again we still waited on Vanessa, and only after I asked the hostess if she can get my credit card from Vanessa because we got tired of waiting did she come back.

81,Mei M.,"Monterey Park, CA",752,120,3805.0,1.0,2015-08-13,"When a restaurant states it will be open a certain time I expect it to be open at that time. I do not expect it to selectively open its doors to only certain patrons. As was the case here. Doors were manually open to let patrons in as opposed to being unlocked and allowing all patrons to walk in on their own.  There is a nice little iPad like tablet on the table. This tablet allows patrons to play games for $0.99/game, order appetizers and desserts. Entrées can only be order through your server. Tablet also has the option to notify your server if you need them. We pressed the server button and it took a while to actually have someone come for us. Servers were seen hanging out around the hostess podium talking amongst themselves but they didn't come when we dinged for our server. After about 10 minutes another server, not our server came to ask if we needed something. That was a bit irritating. To me that goes to show that the tablet isn't doing it's job.

And when we told the hostess about the lack of service she rolled her eyes and continued to be rude!

It was busy since it was happy hour and had to wait 30 mins. No problem, decided to go walk around and check up on movie times. When they took us in they seated us at a table for 8 people, which I thought was funny since there was only two of us. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, took our order and kept checking up on us and see if we needed anything else. He is one of the reasons this place gets a star and the other star goes to that quick order and pay machine they now have on the tables which we used to quickly pay and get out. Drinks: I order the HH $5 Bahama mama and my boyfriend order the BlackBerry and mint drink. When our drinks came, it was pretty disappointing. My mama had just one cherry, looked like some spilled over on the side, and weak. It was like I was just drinking orange juice. My bf drink was a lil stronger but the straw kept getting clogged up and not a pleasant feeling when you have a bunch of seeds stuck in your teeth. Didn't order anymore drinks after that. Food: we ordered the 2 for 25. Our spinach and artichoke dip took 30 mins to get to us. When I saw the dip I automatically knew it was gonna be cold with the sides looking nice and hot and middle had unmelted cheese and looked chunky. Mixed it so it would be at least Luke warm. After an hour of waiting my bf food came first which was the honey chicken and 4 cheese macaroni. I had to wait another 10 mins for my food to come in which my waiter kept apologizing and my bf food was getting cold since he didn't want to eat without me. My half rack of ribs finally comes in with a side of veggies and coleslaw. I think the best part of my meal was the coleslaw. The rib meat was very thin and my veggies were drenched in butter. The bf enjoyed his meal and I was meh on mine. We were going to order the churro s'more dessert but seeing how long it took our food to come, we didn't want to chance it.  Checked in at 9:30 and walked out by 11:30. So 2 hours we were here and didn't end up catching a movie.   It was really busy night and could tell all the waiters and waitresses were stressed and busy so I don't blame them.

They give me an undercooked meat that would barely fill me up and I'm skinny and don't eat a lot. They also gave me half an onion. Free refills and there better be for the soda costing about $2.

80,Jackie D.,"Rosemead, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-08,"I have never had a problem with this restaurant till now. My friend n I were excited to have appetizers and drinks there before our movie but when they told us if they can see our IDs (which we gave them) the crew member said she couldn't take my friends source of ID. My friend is from Argentina so he didn't have a California state ID and she said they couldn't take it. So we asked for the manager and the manager was no help either she said because of ""new laws"" she couldn't take his ID. I work in the restaurant business and there is no law saying you cannot take an out of state or out of the country ID. He even showed her his passport and both had his birthday on it. I will never be going back to this restaurant. How dare you refuse service to my friend. And btw BJs across the street approved his ID and we had a better time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2?start=20,2.2,2.46,2.476,,2.356

I have never been a fan of the food or the service at this place but my friends and I were in the area and decided to grab a few drinks and appetizers... although I still didn't care too much for the food.. our bartenders were amazing! Stacy was very friendly and knowledgeable! She provided swift, excellent customer service!

7,Savannah M.,"Rosemead, CA",60,34,19.0,5.0,2017-12-07,"Awesome service from server Rebecca. We were seated quickly in a nice little booth with a great view of the city. We visited on a Tuesday night and it wasn't too pack. We just came for apps and drinks. We ordered the 2 for $9.99, we chose the spinach artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks and my daughter just got an order of fries. The dip was so delicious and they provided us with a small side of salsa. We finished the dip so fast that the server gave us so more chips and salsa for free which was super sweet. My sister ordered the pomegranate with Sierra Mist drink and I ordered three Long Island iced teas. For the month of December they're promoting them for just a $1 each and the drink was pretty strong btw for only $1 ;) Everything was great and Rebecca was super attentive and social even though we only spent about $20. We had a great time at Applebee's that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2,2.48,2.47,2.484,,2.474
1,Karina C.,"Montebello, CA",1,8,4.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"I personally have never been disappointed at this Applebee's in Montebello. I almost always order the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken. I also love the Four-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. For appetizers we always order the Mozzarella Sticks & Spinach & Artichoke Dip. Delicious!  We always go late so we get seated pretty quickly. And have never had an issue with a server. My daughter loves the Cedar Salmon with Maple Mustard Glaze and the French Onion Soup. And my favorite drink is the Perfect Pomegranate Margarita. Yum! My son on the other hand would probably give it a different rating (but he'll have to get his own Yelp for that). They always mess up his steak. He likes his steak a little bloody so he orders it medium rare, and every time they bring it medium well to well done. We send it back and get it a little closer to his likings. I recommend order rare if you like your steak a little bloody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2,2.64,2.51,2.492,,2.5620000000000003
0,Gary M.,"Montebello, CA",168,611,649.0,5.0,2017-12-29,Food chains are a thing of modern day society and if you go to one you have expectations that need to be met. When judging food chains I look at 3 things: Consistency: The food was prepared well and the quality was spot on for an Applebee's entrée and appetizer. In regards to the food I receive her in my multiple visits I have never had a complaint or a reason to turn any food away.   Cleanliness: Bathrooms are always clean and the dining are looks well maintained and the bar counter is never sticky. Service: The bartenders are always attentive and the servers never let me wait long and lastly my cup of water or soda is always promptly filled or replaced. So in conclusion this is a great Applebee's with quality service and I will keep coming here whenever I want sit down service at decent prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2,2.8,2.53,2.5,,2.638

Spoke to the manager and she apologized but advised us that the food was slow because we ordered slow... she failed to realize appetizers took over 30mins to come out. We were a party of 8 and they sat a party of 7 w/ a baby so close to us that our chairs were touching, all the while them having extra couple feet on the opposite side. Sub par service sub par food mild apologies and nothing else.  Do not come here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-montebello-2,2.8,2.51,2.5,,2.6259999999999994
