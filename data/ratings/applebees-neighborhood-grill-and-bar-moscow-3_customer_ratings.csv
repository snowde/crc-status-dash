12,Todd B.,"McCall, ID",5,27,4.0,3.0,2012-03-03,2 for $20 was good. Fast service. Can't say it was any better or worse than any other Applebee's I have been too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7
4,Alisha B.,"Airway Heights, WA",8,6,,2.0,2013-05-15,"I'll start with the positive: this Applebees has a very friendly staff and great environment compared to other Applebees. I also found the appetizers to be decent. I keep making the mistake of ordering burgers at this place. Numerous times I have tried their burgers and each time couldn't get them down. They are SO dry and overcooked but I am always deceived by the photo on the menu of yummy juicy burgers. I have also had their babyback ribs and they have little meat and as well dry, overcooked. I think I have learned my lesson.... Applebee's is a fun place for drinks and appetizers but their entrees are usually so-so or not good at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
1,Remy L.,"Moscow, ID",2,21,1.0,1.0,2013-07-05,"Two years ago, my husband and I had a bad experience with this restaurant: our waitress spent so long talking loudly to the patrons behind us (about how turquoise could apparently cure cancer if people would just give it a try) that she forgot about our food. The cook brought it out, literally slammed the plates on our table, and stalked off angrily. The food was completely cold. When we tried to mention this to the waitress, she just kept talking about how turquoise cured her roommate's acne and ignored us. No, I'm not making this up. We put cash on the table and walked out - she didn't even notice us leave! Today, we decided to give Applebee's a second chance. After all, things change a lot in two years, right? Sadly, not in this case. Please note through the review that, other than two other tables and us, the place was empty. Strike #1: Our waitress was sexist. When she came to our table, without even saying hello or welcome, she immediately delved into a story about how wonderful her 4th of July was. There's certainly nothing wrong with mentioning that you had a wonderful holiday, but this was a very lengthy and pointless story about one of her friends nearly blowing his fingers off for no reason, which she ended with ""and it's pretty much a fact that all men are stupid."" Even though neither of us said a thing, she then said defensively to my husband, ""I'm allowed to say men are stupid, because I have five brothers. I'm the oldest sister. And they were all dumb."" My husband stayed quiet, so she rolled her eyes and said, ""Okay, you don't agree? Whatever. Well, what do you want to drink then?""  Strike #2: The Thermostat. It was absolutely freezing, and a vent was directly above us. I asked our waitress if she could please turn the air conditioning down a little. ""No,"" she said, pointing at a table seated with two older ladies in heavy sweaters, ""because they asked me 20 minutes ago to turn it up and if I turn it down for you, it'll just get hot and they'll complain, and in the summer all restaurants are either super hot or freezing anyways."" When my husband asked if we could move to a table without a vent overhead, she said, ""Oh, trust me, this is the warmest section of the restaurant, and totally the warmest table, it'll be colder everywhere else."" Strike 3: Ordering. When she took our order, I asked for a burger, medium. She said, ""Oh, we only do burgers in ""pink"" or ""no pink"", so you have to pick one of those. We don't do ""just a little pink."" She didn't write down our order (one burger, a sandwich, and soup), and my husband ended up with the wrong type of sandwich. Strike 4: The Food Itself. The onion soup my husband ordered was, essentially, mildly flavored brown water with oil bubbles floating on the top and a gargantuan hunk of semi-melted cheese. We both tried a bite, but it was so bad that we shared my burger (which was incredibly pink inside, but at least tasted all right) instead. The only thing that actually tasted good was the brownie bite my husband added to make himself feel better about his bad food. I've eaten at other Applebee's locations over the years, and I've had both good food and good service from them! It just seems to be that the food and service at THIS particular location is lacking. Maybe we'll give them a third chance in another two years...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

Hubby's burger was flavorful with pineapple chunks and sweet chili sauce, for a $1 more he added bacon and looked like they used a pretzel bun, fries were a little over seasoned though. My steak was tender and a little well done, wish they let you choose the doneness on it as I like mine medium rare, grains and portobello mushrooms were a great compliment to the dish. Fur kid's grilled chicken breast was a generous portion and I couldn't stop stealing them as I was cutting them into chunks!

27,Janine U.,"Redmond, WA",3,30,1.0,1.0,2015-04-26,"This is not my first visit here, but I can honestly say it was the worst visit.  First we waited over 10 minutes when there was an open booth for 2 people sitting vacant the whole time (we were the only party of 2 in the waiting area).  Then we ended up seated next to an Applebee's employee who not only got fast service, but had the whole wait staff stop by at least 2 times.  Maybe he was a big deal or something.... My daughter ordered strawberry lemonade and what ever they brought her looked like country time lemonade with no strawberries whatsoever. It was nasty and way too sweet.  My Long Island iced tea was the usual - mostly ice and not much drink. Our food was the usual fare and not really any complaints there, but I do have to say the experience overall was not as pleasant as our last visit.  I do not think we will be back to this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3,,,,,

23,Lelee O.,"Pullman, WA",6,51,71.0,4.0,2015-11-08,"I came here during Happy Hour 9pm-12am (something like that) because that's when appetizers (and some drinks) are 50% off. I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip that cost only $4. It was quite tasty too. The boneless wings weren't anything special and the onion rings were crisp on the outside (but not in the inside). But that's standard for most chain restaurants so I'm not too surprised. However, the waitress was friendly and attentive which is not always a given. Oh! And the burger I ordered did have a generous amount of bacon in it which was also awesome. Overall, I'd say it's a great place to go to if you're craving affordable, decent-tasting food late at night.  There's also the 2 for $20 deal where you  can pick an appetizer and two entrees. It's perfect for when you want to split the bill between two people!  PS: I loved the music that was being played.

There were a lot of staff and they all seemed friendly, but the food was really bad. The restaurant is located right next to Wal-Mart and Shari's, so that tells you everything you need to know about the kind of diners who actually choose to eat this mass-produced swill over all the other quality, local restaurants we have in Moscow.

He then did the charge himself on an actual computer, but did not remove the game charge. Then the tablet device set waiting with our charge still on it waiting for ""approval"" to be hit,  we weren't about to walk away with our payment pending like that. The waiter explained it would time out in 5 minutes but we waited and it didn't. We manually shut the thing off so our card couldn't be charged again.

19,Jonathan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",271,45,99.0,4.0,2016-09-07,"Attention to tourists and travelers, if you are ever in Moscow and are in desperate need of food, fear not! Applebee's is here to save the day!!! In Moscow, there aren't that many choices when it comes down to food. However, you certainly can't go wrong with Applebee's. I have gone to many Applebee's in SoCal and here, the service is definitely better and more prompt. I think this is partly due to the fact that there is no one is Moscow and therefore, less customers at Applebee's, allowing the servers to be more attentive.  In terms of the food, it's just standard American cuisine. I had the honey BBQ boneless wings as appetizers. Unfortunately, they went too strong on the sauce and the BBQ was simply too overwhelming. For entree, I ordered the 8oz sirloin steak with honey pecan sweet mashed potato and garlic green beans. I asked for the steak to be medium rare and it was cooked perfect to order (see picture). The fact that it was also next to the pecan sweet mashed potato also gave the steak a gentle, sweet, smoky flavor, which was an excellent addition to the overall aroma of the steak. The sides however, were disappointing. The sweet mashed potato was wayyyy too sweet. At one point, I felt like I was drinking drops of honey. I think I should have had it along with the steak, but I ate it separately. The green beans did not taste garlicky. It was pretty bland overall. Tastes pretty much like boiled green beans in water. I would give the food 3 stars. However due to the attentive service and the fact that they actually have Applebee's at Moscow, I would give this place an overall rating of 4 stars. Thank god for Applebee's so that I didn't have to drive out 2 hours to eat decent American food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
