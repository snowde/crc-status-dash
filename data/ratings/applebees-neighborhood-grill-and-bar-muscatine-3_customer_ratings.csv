14,Carin E.,"Chicago, IL",3,28,,2.0,2012-01-09,"I was somewhat disappointed. My bread sticks were cold and dry. For the price of my meal I expected better service from the waitstaff. Even after having pushed my plates to the end of the table, the waitstaff didn't seem to get it (back and fourth and no clearing). Mgmt needs to retrain some of it's waitstaff as well as cooks. The good thing is the cocktails and drinks made up for it.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,
11,Ellen E.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,165,4.0,4.0,2012-12-29,"When everything else in Muscatine is closed because of a blizzard, you can count on Applebee's to be open. The menu has been revamped, so it's slightly more upscale than it was and there are plenty of menu options. Service can be a bit slow, but that's because they're making up for all the other restaurants closing early. Applebee's is what it is and for that, 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,
10,Leslie H.,"Carmel, IN",319,396,346.0,4.0,2013-05-27,"It's a great neighborhood bar and grill since there's not a whole lot of options in the area. There are a lot of regulars who come here and hang out at the bar, order their decent priced lunch menu and have a beer or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,
12,Nestor N.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,2014-08-03,"This place is real dirty . They had a lot of garbage on floor.

Food was the best, seated right away with wait staff to great us, our waiter came and took our order and was very friendly and well versed of the menu to answer any of our questions. He checked on us numerous times. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Establishment very clean.Would definitely recommend going to anyone.

1,Zach A.,"Chicago, IL",183,505,13.0,2.0,2016-01-19,"I ordered a steak, what a terrible cut of meat! it was fatty and not tasty. Where were the mushrooms? 2 slices were buried in all  the onions. Blah! And the salad was dry with little dressing and not like the picture. But the waitress was nice, hence the 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,
5,McKenzie G.,"Dixon, IL",8,24,,2.0,2016-02-22,I have been super disappointed our last couple trips  here that we very likely won't return. On 1 occasion my New York strip steak was completely gristle & fat throughout then another time my pasta dish was more like soup bathing in thin nasty sauce where I couldn't even see the pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,
2,D K.,"Downers Grove, IL",161,24,5.0,5.0,2017-02-13,"Chad is a real pro - seriously. Explained the offerings and beers on tap while salting my coaster so it did not keep sticking to my glass.  He said it was ""an old bartender's trick."" Never seen that before and I have seen too many old bartenders. Nice touch with real friendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3,,,,,

0,David B.,"Independence, MO",0,1,,5.0,2017-08-31,My first time in an Applebee's. Ordered the sirloin with parmesan shrimp. Fantastic! Steak cooked perfectly.
