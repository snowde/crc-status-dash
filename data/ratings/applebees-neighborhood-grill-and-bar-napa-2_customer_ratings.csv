You know, you need a meal, have no idea about anywhere else and you see the Applebee's sign. This time was no exception. Actually the food in Applebee's is fairly decent but the beer selection is usually really bad. Not here. I had a Laguanitas and Judit I cannot remember - Anchor Steam maybe? We ordered a dish to share and there was no issue. I do not remember what it was but it involved steak. and it was nicely done as ordered. Service was good.

I tried their new jalapeno spicy chicken salad that the menu and waitress described as being really spicy. I don't eat a lot of spicy food and it was not spicy at all. The chicken was chopped up into the size of a piece of corn and couldn't get it onto my fork. On top of that, it was a very sweet sauce that just did not mix well with the flavor.

I use to work for Applebees back in 2007-2008 and their food has totally improved! After working there and finding out how unclean they were.. I was a little hesitant to return. At one point, at the Vacaville location, I did get food poisoning from the nachos. It stopped me from eating there up until yesterday. I'll try and keep this short.. My family and I decided to come to this location because it is close to home and we were celebrating my step dads 50th birthday. Because of my last experience I wasn't so thrilled but agreed to go. We walked in and were greeted by a really nice hostess. She asked how many and my grandparents were unsure because my family is huge and we never know how many is going to show up.  She was understanding and waited until we were ready to be seated.  She set up two tables and our server was over in a very timely manner.   He pointed out that we could order from the menu or the ""Presto"" machines on the tables.  Those things were cool! I ordered my food and within 15 minutes my food was brought to my table.  My dinner was delicious. I had a Chicken sandwich and fries and my family enjoyed their dinner as well. Overall, I'm glad I gave this place another shot. Friendly staff and good food at a decent price :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=60,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.7359999999999998,2.88

Because of the power outage, the tab kept being incorrect. It took 3 times of sending the tab back to get it correct.

Our food came out pretty quickly but wasn't brought by our server an then our server never came back, everyone at the table needed refills and the only reason we got them was because we got up and asked a manager, even after that the manager told our server then our server came over and asked if we needed refills we said yes then a minute later the manager came back over and figured out what we were drinking, still the server didnt bring back anything. Then we waited again for the check for what seemed like forever and then had to wait again to get our cards picked up, when she never came back we just left cash and ran out, another table left at the sane time as us after waiting for the same server for over 30 minutes and never got there order taken",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.212,3.0400000000000005

I said I needed to be at a graduation and heading straight there so I didn't think I'd be able to come in early. He proceeded to say that he'd let me do this just this time-which a logical person would assume ok we'll make an exception and let you make a reservation. I said we shouldn't be more than 15 people he said I'll put you down for 20-I said ok. We come in at 9pm and talked to the hostess she says we don't make reservations and I said the manager let me for tonight-she went to talk to him and he said we only had a conversation about it but we still needed to wait (which is not at all what my understanding of the conversation was). I said ok that's fine-35 minutes later I'm still waiting-and they still have not told me how long it's going to take or checked in with us about the wait at all. We could've just went to a restaurant in Vallejo if the manager just told me they don't take reservations-I would've been fine with a simple ""no"" and moved on.

Ordering was a pain, we were confused whether to order from their Presto tablet device or deal with the stress of a socially awkward server. Once we placed our order electronically it took foreverrrrr to arrive! Also, a new cook is a poor excuse for bringing us lukewarm food well after its expected arrival time.

The silverware was dirty. WORST OF ALL my wife left her Droid Smartphone on the table and we noticed a block away from the restaurant.

We originally sat in a booth and the waiter walked by us 4 times without saying anything so we decided to go to the bar to get better service. What a mistake!!!  The bartender name brian, wearing an orange shirt was the worst service I have ever gotten at a bar- period. I mean you have one job - Fill drinks, get food orders, and stay behind the bar. If You are in the weeds with 8 patrons sitting at the bar, you shouldn't have a job. Ive work in restaurants for years. If someone is trying to talk to you to ASK for service then you have FAILED. I know when I'm being ignored on purpose. When I asked for waters and it takes 5minutes to get them while he went to someone who ordered AFTER me and make them a drink just annoyed me. (Hint: It is noticeable) it is a bar. Your moves are on display. He couldn't even bus the dirty used glasses off the bar nor did he say thank you or your welcome. Shitty attitude with shitty service. Again--- it was NOT busy. If you can't do your job, you shouldn't have one.

After entering the bar area and being ignored for five minutes by a bartender who was engaged in a heated discussion with the ""regulars"" about a construction project, I ordered a beer. I was told I needed an I.D. I am 64 years old... I look 64 years old... I act 64 years old...I did two tours of duty in Viet Nam... My wallet was in my briefcase, so a half hour away at home. Yes, I was told it was a ""policy"" to require identification. Yes, it is not the bartender's fault, but there should be some reasonable application of this policy. I left the restaurant, deciding to vote on this policy and treatment with my lunch dollars and will not return, nor will I recommend it to anyone (I work in a hotel close by and am often asked to recommend easy,convenient restaurants).

The food was fine and our second server Amy was kind (although she ordered us a $9 dollar lemon drop martini instead of the $4 lemon drop shot, however the extra cost was removed from our bill.) To start we ordered 3 jeager bombs and 3 kamikazi. They brought 6 glasses out and our fist server maxi said they were the jeager bombs. Literally every other applebees and every other bar for that matter comes with a glass with the red Bull and a shot glass full of jeager however these were just glasses. Jeager bombs come with two parts so we assumed they were to be mixed and then drank. We waited for the 3 kamikazi we ordered and eventually asked where it was since maxi never came back with a second drink. The manager a thin woman with long dark hair then very rudely and aggressively came up to our table and said she ""knew for a fact that we got two drinks already"" as if accusing us of lying and trying to get free drinks! When we tried to explain we thought the two glasses were for the jeager bomb she condescendingly told us their chain doesn't allow for them to have people drop the shot in because the glass could break therefor their jeager bomb comes premixed. Like I said no applebees or bar I've been to does that they all have plastic cups for the shot. On their menu they even have a picture of the red plastic shot glass that goes with a jeager bomb. If I had know that we wouldn't have ordered it period yet they offered no apology, they didn't remove the drinks from our bill, and they were aggressive and rude on top of that so we had a ruined jeager bomb/ kamikazi mashup.

Whilst this was happening my husband finally scopes out the manger who looked straight back at him, never came to our table - he was talking to an employee who had her food eating at a side table. After he looks back he ends up bringing a table other than ours ( our drinks were empty) another refill and still never made his way over in the very unpacked restaurant and this table he visited was two tables away from us, same section. Mind you after making eye contact with my husband. My husband ended up having to go up to the mngr Marc, explain the situation how he felt disrespected and didn't accept the comp meal based on the service he was overseeing and providing. We both have worked in customer service with pride for over 10yrs so we know good, great, poor and really bad service.

30,Yosh H.,"Napa, CA",4,4,1.0,1.0,2016-12-12,"Alright, let me just start with saying that the Applebee's Menu is absolutely barren. I have memories of there being a lot more on the menu, what gives? My dad and I went in here this evening and we had an atrocious experience. We ordered our appetizers and were seated rather quickly, but I couldn't find a damn thing to order beyond that. I decided to settle on the Fish and Chips. Our Appetizer came quickly, which was about 7 chicken tenders covered in buffalo sauce masquerading as wings. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but this is probably the only good part of the meal, as it all went downhill from there. When the fish and chips arrived, it looked fine at first. I bit into the fish and chips, and, it was fine. At first. The further I proceeded into the fish, the flavor immediately died, and the entire fish had essentially fallen flat. Thinking it may only be this one, I bit into the other one's midsection. Same problem. They hadn't cooked any of them thoroughly enough to get the flavor in. The fries were fine, but they're fries, it's hard to mess that up. After my lackluster meal was complete, I decided to have dessert. I had a Hot Fudge Meltdown, which is also known as lava cake and a scoop of ice cream. The server warned me, however, that they had no hot fudge, which immediately baffled me. They would be able to serve me a CAKE, but had no ability to make FUDGE HOT. Don't they microwave all of their food before sending it out, regardless? The food aside, there were other things that were strange and confusing about this evening were the way that service was done. There were no napkins. Anywhere. There were no dispensers to obtain napkins. We had to ASK for napkins. And what napkins we got were essentially drink coasters. Thin, little measly pieces of paper. We also had to ask for silverware, which didn't even come with our food in the first place. Speaking of the food, it was all in strangely small portions? None of this would justify to me that our meal would be worth 65 dollars.

Those were little, crunchy bites of heaven! All of their drinks are too sweet for me, but if you get a gin and tonic you will be happy.

Now, I could understand this being a possible problem in the middle of a dinner rush. Unfortunately, this was not a dinner rush. The restaurant was nearly empty, and we are in the middle of a natural disaster. We had all had a long drawn-out day number 2 of the Napa fires and just really wanted to relax and have a nice meal. Our host who sat us was amazing. He asked us if we were personally affected by the fires, we had a nice conversation about our experiences, and he wished us well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=20,2.24,2.55,2.55,,2.426

7,Douglas B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,65,6.0,5.0,2017-11-13,Went too this Applebees on veterans day with a group of four. Three of which were veterans. They gave us three free meals from a special menu without any question. The service was great and the food was delicious! I was really impressed and felt appreciated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2,2.4,2.57,2.57,,2.502
5,Cynthia L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",21,4,,2.0,2017-11-19,"Food was good. Brownie bite was outstanding. Service was mediocre at best. Food came before or salad and appetizer. Our server seemed distracted and somewhat overwhelmed. If the restaurant had been busy I could understand her inattentiveness. However, it was very quiet for a late afternoon Sunday lunch. Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2,2.44,2.58,2.58,,2.524
6,Mary V.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-25,Hi my family and friends all enjoy applebees  However tonight we went to Applebee's in Napa CA. and we're disappointed. We took our 17 yr old out so they can si g happy birthday to her. The waitress was kind enough and brought an ice cream Sunday but was sorry to say her manager doesn't  allow time to sing happy birthday anymore. I told her that's why we came here tonight the applebees in other cities still do so. She brought over the ice cream and sang with us. Great waitress poor manager customer service ! Don't go if you want to be sung to too celebrate your bday!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2,2.44,2.55,2.55,,2.5060000000000002
2,Lily W.,"Napa, CA",110,172,34.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Often quite busy in the late evenings (when many other local spots are closed or about to close), there's usually at least a moderate wait to be seated.  On weekdays, there seems to be a shortage of servers since there are usually plenty of tables open, but the line by the door is still pretty long.  Food and service is average as expected of a chain restaurant, but the servers are always polite!  Restaurant is clean with an abundant menu available.  I often crave the spinach-artichoke dip, which is admittedly quite salty, but it hits the spot! It's a reliable place to go for a no-frills late night dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2,2.44,2.54,2.54,,2.5
4,Skank H.,"Napa, CA",0,12,,1.0,2017-12-11,"Don't buy appetizers if you don't like them to be thawed out and unfrozen prior to eating them . Utensils and plates came with water from the dishwasher still on them . Unaware if they had any cleaning agents on them . Had to wait 30 mins to get one entree dish redone because of that .  If you like real spirits DONT come here they look and are artificially colored . Stick to rum and coke, gin and juice , ETC burgers are done well rare when you ask for well done anougher time we came here . Never coming back again ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2,2.44,2.51,2.51,,2.482
