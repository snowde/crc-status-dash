1,Michael M.,"Natchez, MS",8,1,,1.0,2017-10-08,"Worst service experience I ever had. Entered the restaurant and waited 10 mins for the hostess to acknowledge me. Then when she did acknowledge me, I had to wait another 10 mins to be waited on. It went down hill from there. Â My ordered draft beer turned into a bottled miller light. My ordered black bean soup was cold and the beans were burnt; I received it 30 mins after it was ordered. I received no eye contact from the waiter. My daughter's refillable drinks were not refilled. Ordered an entree with sweet potato fries and broccoli. The sweet potato fries came cold with no broccoli. The one star that was given is for their appetizer, the honey BBQ bone -in -wings. Those wing were one of the best wings I ever tasted but I would not recommend the restaurant to someone who requires good service and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-natchez-2,,,,,
