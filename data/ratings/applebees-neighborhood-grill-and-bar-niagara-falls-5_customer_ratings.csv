When we questioned the waitress, she insisted they were chocolate (even though they were pure white and tasted clearly of vanilla).

38,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4355,2413,14771.0,2.0,2012-08-20,"What a depressing restaurant along the Fallsview Street. I'm sure there are much better places to eat in the tourist zone, go anywhere else. Seriously when I walked in, it just felt sad inside. Applebee's was right next to the Oakes Hotel we were staying at which meant less than a minute walking to get there. They advertised a $6.99 breakfast special on the sign so we headed on in. When we went in the waitress told us that people staying at the Oakes get 10% off, score! She gave us a breakfast menu with a page of way overpriced items all about $10 on it. The $6.99 special that lured us in was nowhere to be found on the breakfast menu. When I asked about it, she told us what it was, then seemed annoyed when I ordered it. Eh, okay? She wasn't very friendly the whole meal and then forgot to give us the 10% off. We didn't even bother reminding her, just paid our $21 bill (including tax & tip) and got the heck out of there! $6.99 is about as cheap as it gets for breakfast in the Falls, but to advertise it outside, then not on the menu, then get agitated when people order it...seems a bit shady to me! It's dreary and way overpriced!

35,Kris U.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2917,1220,3534.0,2.0,2012-12-10,"This review has been sitting in my queue for awhile and after avoiding it for sometime I decided to go forth and write it. Ok, so Applebee's this review isn't a reflection of your staff or service to me they were aces. This review is a reflection of your selection and quality of cusine when I visited several months ago for breakfast.  To clarify I used to live in Windsor, ON and I enjoyed many a lunch at the Applebee's there as well as the occasional dinner. Breakfast is certainly not your strongest suit. I had a standard bacon and eggs breakie with rye toast and to mee all but the eggs really fell flat. My request for soft bacon was ignored and I got crispy with a nice tan of black and the Rye toast was cold and saturated with butter (or butter spray - not sure). The over-sized portion of deep fried french fried potatoes didn't do very much to make up for anything either.  While the staff provided some great service, the cafeteria style breakfast felt mass prodced, overdone and with little care or attention. Hard to believe you were empty when we walked in....  My helpful hint: You've done great work with front of house, now time to whip your kitchen into shape. You're in a major tourist area, too many meals like this and people wont be back. I'll give you another shot when I'm back in town next summer - always about a second chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=20,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

71,Karen S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",60,6,,4.0,2013-06-27,"We ate here before returning to the Oakes hotel.  It was probably a pretty typical Applebee's experience, which I feel is pretty important in this town because I thought many other restaurants were so expensive and served such low quality food in comparison to the ""normal"" locations.  This was pretty much what I'd expect from a family style chain.    The kids got your typical kids' meals -- 2 ordered pizza and 1 ordered mac and cheese.  The price (I believe it was about $5.99) included a drink and dessert.  The dessert choices would have been ice cream or chocolate pudding but unfortunately the were out of them.  The waitress offered applesauce as a replacement.  They weren't hungry after eating most of their dinners, so we declined.  If perhaps another more tempting dessert had been offered I'm sure we'd have accepted!   My husband and I ordered from the 2 for $25 menu.  We both got the Fiesta Lime Chicken and shared the Queso Blanco appetizer.  It was pretty good.  I will definitely try to replicate that chicken recipe at home.  We also each had a beer.   The plates were terribly hot -- not only an inconvenience but also a reminder that the food has been under heating lamps.  However, the food was tasty regardless.   The decor was typical Applebee's -- busy and bright.  The table was a little sticky -- clean but could probably use a refinishing.  The service was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful. Again, this isn't fine dining but especially with the prices that reflected those outside a tourist district, we were pleased.  We'd definitely be open to coming again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16

Anyways, if you have the vouchers, you can take your breakfast to go! My mistake was eating in there the first morning. Nothing much to see. Second morning however, we had our breakfast to go, and ate it in our hotel room next door at Oakes, so we can enjoy the Niagara Falls and eat at the same time.

69,Fred S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,32,113.0,1.0,2013-11-26,"Applebees at the Canadian Niagara Falls  - I'd read the bad reviews about Applebee's but took a chance since there're not a lot of good options at this tourist trap. The other area restaurants also have less than steller Yelp reviews too e.g. Ruth's Chris Steak House, Vinny's, etc all of which were within walking distance from the hotel. It's pretty obvious that the area businesses aren't counting on repeat customers.  Food quality - The food tasted so-so. Those of us that ate fried stuff didnt suffer but my son ate coleslaw and later served penance by kneeling before the porcelain god. Presentation - The presentation is unappealing and that's putting it charitably. Ambience - The interior looks better seen through the windows from the outside. Inside, the seats are uncomfortable and point source lighting over the tables were glaring instead of warm and mellow.  Service - Got seated promptly as the restaurant was relatively empty at dinner time. The service was basic, the server got us what we wanted and then left us alone, only checking back once. It took a while to pay and leave because none of the staff were to be found. Price - Poor value for money.  I'd rather spend $10 more per steak and have a better meal at The Keg (N.B. Didn't try the Keg at Niagara, went to the one in Calgary). Verdict- Fail. Visited on 14 Nov 2013.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=40,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002
57,Alyssa B.,"ASTORIA, NY",188,245,137.0,3.0,2013-12-03,"I'm not a fan of Applebee's. Never have been and probably never will be. We ate breakfast here because it was conveniently attached to our hotel. They had all the basics.. eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bread. The first day I ordered eggs over medium with 2 strips of bacon and wheat toast. It came with home fries. They actually cooked my eggs to order, which I think is a very rare thing when you order ""over medium,"" so kudos to the chef for that. The bacon and the toast were standard. My potatoes were seasoned well, but they weren't really cooked all the way through. The second morning I ordered the western, which is like an omelette sandwich. It was huge! and it was actually packed full of peppers, onions and cheese. The potatoes were actually cooked this time.  I wish they offered something a little healthier - such as egg whites, although i'm sure you can ask for that. Maybe a cup of fruit would be nice. Also, I would prefer real milk/cream with my coffee rather than those little plastic creamer cups.

33,Charles R.,"Mississauga, Canada",14,120,4.0,3.0,2014-02-17,"On a recent Niagara Falls visit, we had the opportunity to dine at this Applebees for both Dinner and Breakfast the following morning.  We have dined at this location easily 15-20 times over the last 10 years. Dinner was after a day of sightseeing.  It was moderately busy and all the booths were taken so we had a table for our family of five.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  For me it worked quite well.  Yum Yum.  Only downside that I have with most restaurant salads is that there was way too much dressing in it.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side and easily dropped 40% of the calories off of this 1200 calorie behemoth. I spent too much time coaxing my younger daughter to eat to notice what the rest of the family was eating.  The daughter had the kids pizza which tasted decent, based on the one bite that I had.  I know my son had Mac and Cheese, which disappeared quite quickly. The food is all standard fare.  We were happy Our server, L, (I won't say her full name) was awesome!  She dealt with the 1001 questions from my three year old daughter like a champ and still remained energetic around her. Breakfast we had J as a server.  We had two orders of pancakes, 1 of fruit loops, 1 omelette, and I had the french toast.  My wife liked her omelette.  My french toast was blase.  It was just bread, with egg wash.  Every chef, except the breakfast chef at Applebees, knows that you put cinnamon in French Toast. Though breakfast here was bland, at least they didn't try to financially rape me like the iHop down the street tried.  For that, we will continue to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=20,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004

I have eaten at multiple Applebee's and the staff here is the worst staff I have ever seen in a restaurant. First, the barback took our drink order because the bartender was too busy on her phone to notice that we had sat down at the bar, we were literally the only people there. On top of that once the barback told her our drinks, she still took 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We ordered mozzarella sticks; they took 20 minutes to come out. They were cold and tasted awful. The inside was cold and chunky like cottage cheese instead of stringy like it is supposed to be. It took us 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention because she was too busy socializing with her co-workers and gossiping loudly about person issues within the restaurant. Once we finally got her attention and described the issue, she simply said nobody else has complained so maybe it's just you. My boyfriend was pissed at this point; he asked to speak to the manager. After 10 more minutes of waiting the manager never came out. We cancelled our order and left. It was literally the worst dining experience I have ever had.
