8,Patsy B.,"Lancaster, KY",0,5,2.0,4.0,2014-01-29,"The potato soup on Wednesday at lunch is delicious  with a grill cheese or turkey sandwich or any of the sandwiches. They got me right in and out, I have one hour for lunch and I was back in the office at 12:40. That includes driving time, I consider that very good service.  Will go have to go for dinner soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
7,Teresa J.,"Lexington, KY",45,45,11.0,3.0,2014-02-06,"Applebee's is good for a casual night out, date night or just to watch a game.   Food is just short of good, prices are so-so.   I've discovered lately that while places keep increasing their menu prices, the food quality/quantity seems to go lower.    If they expect people not to notice, they're wrong.    Still, Applebee's serves it's purpose I suppose, just the neighborhood joint down the road.   Oh, and having a gift card to use kind of helps nudge one to 'check-in'.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
4,Gwen O.,"Nicholasville, KY",9,49,148.0,2.0,2014-06-24,Well we came for 1\2 price appetizers and was disappointed with the new selection. The chicken wonton tacos were good and the salad was a salad lol. Not the greatest experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
5,Sylvia R.,"Nicholasville, KY",4,20,40.0,4.0,2014-09-10,Great place to come with a group or just for two. Food is wonderful and the atmosphere is fun.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
2,Taz D.,"Lexington, KY",3,34,51.0,2.0,2015-06-14,"Our server was very pleasant. Her name was Cain. She kept our water glasses full and tended to our needs. EXCELLENT service from her!! 5 stars!!! I ordered a 7 oz sirloin steak with no butter on my veggies and only cheese on my baked potato. The steak looked like it was a VERY cheap piece of meat; but it was actually done medium rare and tasted very good. The broccoli was perfect and the baked potato was fine, nothing special about it. I will say that after 10 mins of leaving the restaurant, I became very sick from the steak. I threw up and felt like I had food poisoning. My husband and I went to WalMart across the road and picked up several bottles of stomach medicine.  My husband ordered the Triple Hog Dare Ya. The bread was soggy, and was full of grease....dripping. The ham on the bottom wasn't even warm, it was still cold and he only had 1 piece of bacon. Bacon is love to him. It made him sick to him stomach (and he never gets sick to his stomach) and it was a very poor meal. He saw it on an ad on the TV and it looked absolutely delicious from there.   We probably won't be going back again because of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
6,Pablo G.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,3,,1.0,2015-09-16,"Poor service , really wait and wait ....  One person to serve 8 tables ?? Really poor management.  Won't go there anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
3,Linds H.,"Nicholasville, KY",14,38,7.0,1.0,2016-02-17,"This place is always risky. I've only eaten inside a couple times, and it seemed classless tbh. The staff aren't very friendly or helpful.  What upset me was the last time we ordered curbside. (we don't do this super frequently but it's very convenient and usually yummy.) And that is the reason I won't be going back to this location- and probably won't use Applebee's again because they're not that special to go out of my way for. But we ordered online and it said it'd be ready in 20 minutes. We live 5 mins away so we left a little early just in case. It was literally 30 minutes later before it arrived. We were never greeted. Some girl hurriedly ran to the window with a bag of food (and I thought ""that was fast!"" and was super pleased and then extremely disappointed) that wasn't ours and then instead of asking our name, giving us a total, or jack crap she was just like"" Oh it'll be a few minutes."" I'm not kidding, 30 minutes later. I was disgusted. She forgot to bring the drink we ordered and we forgot to ask because it was shocking the rush she was in to drop off our food (along with the person who just happened to pull up behind us...making me wonder, why she was waiting to bring our food with someone else's when we were waiting so long)... no apology, no have-a-good-night.  I wouldn't waste my time trying with this place if you're looking for good service or a completed order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
1,Emily M.,"Lexington, KY",3,27,6.0,1.0,2016-02-23,I went with a friend and we both are so sick! I ordered a hamburger and the burger was raw in the middle and the tomato slice was rotten and when I told my waitress she just brought me a new slice. A rotten tomato was on my raw burger I'm not eating it. And my friend ordered chicken wings and the chicken was cold and soggy. Never going back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
0,Kathy R.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,6,,3.0,2017-07-12,"Applebee's was amazing when it first came to Nicholasville.  One of my favorite salad was a chicken pecan salad and we loved the nachos.  Then, suddenly the salad was gone, and the nachos were ""improved"".  The reasons we went to eat there were limited by the changes in the menu.  The only thing they seem to have kept over the years was a blondie with a maple sauce that is to die for.  Recently, they have made some changes to the menu that are really tasty.  We gave them a chance after having not visited in 3 or 4 years.  The additions to the menu are really good, and have brought us back on probably a monthly basis. If you haven't been in a while, it is worth giving them a chance to prove that they are keeping up with the times and adding great menu items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-nicholasville-3,,,,,
