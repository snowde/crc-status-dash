120,Amanda C.,"Oceanside, CA",127,23,19.0,3.0,2012-02-14,Love the happy hour specials! I ordered a surf and turf thing but my steak was really tough and indigestible.

But i thought about it and drinking plus people watching...this place is too easy lol. The bar is pretty huge, the bartender was friendly and cracking jokes which lightened up my mood. How the bar is setup its smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. its a real cool vibe, the only thing that was bothering me is the people that do go to the bar are pretty much creeps or weirdos that cant stop staring at you. Their food is pretty good, just a little pricey for a small amount i say.

It was like I reheated leftover in the microwave.   We ordered a skillet dish and it was so salty and a burger and one beer and it was 29.00 without tip.   I know all restaurants have bad nights and sometimes a decent cook makes the difference, but I ate almost the entire burger and wanted to throw up later!!!!!

44,Dani J.,"Vista, CA",301,232,284.0,1.0,2012-12-05,"This one time, a few years ago, I went to Applebee's for steak (why...whyy???), and got so grossed out by the bloody, purple artery-type thing jiggling its way out of the meat that I swore I'd never eat at another Applebee's again.  One night a few weeks ago, our friends suggested we all meet for dinner. One of them was craving the queso at Applebee's, so against my better judgement, I obliged rather than pleading nooo. What a mistake that was! We got the aforementioned queso, and much to her disappointment, it was smaller and colder than she remembered it being.  Entrees arrived, and I seriously couldn't believe what I saw. I ordered a burger, thinking hey, can't go wrong with that. It was a small greaseball, and looked like it was thrown on the plate with a small handful of fries. I could have had a SUBSTANTIALLY better burger and fries (and soda!) for half the prize at Carls Jr.  My boyfriend got chicken fingers thinking the same thing, can't screw up chicken fingers. Wrong again! They were tiny (notice a trend here?), so overcooked they were hard and chewy, and once again, a small handful of fries thrown on the plate. They should start using smaller plates, at least it wouldn't look so barren and sh*tty. He was starving, and he didn't even eat half. Which in Applebee's portions is like a tablespoon of chicken fingers. Also, their honey mustard is gross. I don't get how people eat here. With choices like Chilis, BJs, etc. where the food actually tastes good, it is just a mystery to me.  You know what the worst part about all of it was? Paying $40+ for 2 small crappy meals, a soda, a beer, splitting an app that is just chips and dip, and leaving hungry. If you are questioning whether you want to give Applebee's another shot, maybe it's changed, maybe it's better...don't do it!!!!  Only positive is that the server was a sweet woman.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=80,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.116,3.1200000000000006

First off, we had one server take drink orders, then a few minutes later we got another server...no explanation why. We also did not get any napkins or silverware, we had to grab them from another table. Then it took 20 minutes to get my frozen lemonade when there were only 4 tables with customers. I was willing to overlook that, our server was very nice and my daughter had her frozen lemonade so I sipped some of hers. The appetizers were pretty good, except the wings which tasted frozen, overcooked, and looked like cat vomit. It just got worse from there. My fiancé's ribs were pretty much all bone and he got original sauce when he ordered the chipotle sauce. My steak, which was ordered medium, was well done, fatty, gristly, and tasted like breakfast sausage. I only ate a few bites.

Another 10 minutes passed and we still did not have our drinks from the bar or even the water that we ordered.  We heard another couple behind us complaining of the same thing so I turned around and asked them how long they had been waiting.  To my surprise they said they had been waiting almost 15 minutes for their bill and that they had asked to speak with a manager. We decided to get up and leave the restaurant because after almost 30 minutes of walking in the door, we still had not received anything.  When I got to the car, I contacted the restaurant and spoke with a manager over the phone because I felt like i should explain myself as to why we left after ordering and before receiving our meal.  He did apologize and told me that they are understaffed at the moment. I wish I could write a review on the food, but I didn't have an opportunity to try it.  Good Luck to anyone that decides to venture here.

4,Katie S.,"Long Beach, CA",266,15,18.0,1.0,2015-07-14,"Let me start with this...I understand this is Applebee's, not a 5 star, high end restaurant. However, the lack of customer service at this location is horrendous and the food was ""eh"" at best. They sat us quickly, which was nice since we were here with my 89 year old grandmother.  Secondly, where my grandma was sitting, the sun was glaring straight into her eyes from one of the windows, so another server closed the blinds for us. So, we'll attribute the 1 star to those 2 things. To make a long story as short as possible, our server was anything but attentive. Our drinks would become completely empty before she would refill them and we had to ask most of the time. She wasn't helpful in recommending anything or guiding us through the menu (i.e. showing us where to find the drink options). Also, our food took almost 35 minutes - let's take into account the fact that we were one of 4 tables when we ordered and I'm pretty sure there were 4 servers on duty.  The food was fine, but definitely very small portions and did not look as pictured or described (much smaller in size). Also, we asked our server if they did anything for birthdays, since we were celebrating my grandma's birthday - she said yes, little did we know, they charge for the dessert - mentioning that to us would have been nice. My father asked to see a manager when the bill came mainly due to our food taking so long and that's when the server told us they were short staffed in the kitchen - she could have mentioned this/apologized for the delay due to this during the 35 minutes we waited for our salads and sandwiches. When the manager came out, he didn't even know which table he was supposed to be going to and just started approaching every table in our area before finally getting to us and realizing we were the ones that had requested to speak to him. He didn't introduce himself either, which just seemed unprofessional. He did apologize and said he would supply a discount, but didn't specify what that would be - no big deal, we appreciated that we would be getting a discount. Once we got the new bill, he told my mother that he had taken off one of the lunch specials (he picked the cheapest one out of our 6 meals) and the birthday dessert...this is when we found out they had planned to charge for this. It was a pretty cheap way to provide a discount as an apology for the complete lack of customer service.

Not to mention she embarrassed a guest by yelling out saying  she was in the middle of something and couldn't get his table some waters. I felt bad for the guy and his date because even though  I wasn't by the bar, I heard her yelling at him and then yelling at a different server/busser to get the waters . The time it took her to yell, she could have been filling up the waters an satisfying her guest. Customer service is everything and she not only failed in that, she disturbed me and my boyfriend in a different section.

My husband and I went in on Saturday Jan 21 at 1pm and sat at the bar. We ordered Buffalo Wings (which were great), I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a steak. He ordered his steak Medium Rare and it came out Medium Well, so he asked for a new one. The second steak came out cooked on the outside and COLD on the inside. YUCK! Not only that, the bar had the smell of mildew so I had to move seats and the Hostess Alice had her blue phone in her back pocket and would text any chance she could get. The Manager Jose was nice and removed the steak from our check. Needless to say, we will not return to this Applebees again.

The first thing we see when we walk in is a sign saying  something about if you don't donate you're helping kill a baby..( I'll get to that)  anyway I ignore that as much as possible because I'm in a resturaunt I'm here to eat and enjoy myself not be foot tripped like that. So someone sat is down and as we waited for our food I see this lady walking around the store giving lil green custom made cards asking for donations and then outta nowhere she  popped up at my table and I honestly thought it was the waitress.. Seeing her and her baby along with her card for donations just didn't sit right with me and it looked like the manager was behind her barely removing her after she looked like she'd been there a good thirty minutes.

Vacationing in Carlsbad, we'd tried several To-Go options and every time something was wrong with the order, not ready for a long while or things missing all together. So when we pulled up into the Curbside designated parking spots, we were not hopeful that things would be going our way. However, we were pleasantly surprised that upon parking someone was immediately out to the car (I accidently the out the receipt, but I believe the girl's name was Falascity - forgive the spelling of its wrong!).

Even though it's open seating at the bar! Then she brought the manger to me which was zack he didn't have any customer service he couldn't even tell me that I couldn't seat there even though we always sit there with no problem but today wasn't lucky .

These were the reasons I use to come here and it has been a while because we don't have a location South Orange County but I am sad.  It seems like the menu was altered to fit some kind of low calorie agenda.  Their watermelon margarita was so so....Dave & Busters has one that is much better.  I liked their chicken tortilla soup but they didnt include lime wedges and the chicken tasted canned.  Anyways, I was dying to have a blondie but I was too full and skipped dessert.  Their bathroom were disgusting and needed cleaning and the paper towels were out.

I told the waitress and she blatantly gave me attitude and rolled her eyes as she walked away to ""see what she could do"" about getting me a different drink. Some Betty Boop looking ass manager came over and asked what was wrong with the drink and when I told her I couldn't possibly finish the drink she proceeded to make me feel guilty for wasting the beverage.

The waitress Brianna V. ruined the entire experience, and that's saying a lot since it took us 45 minutes to be seated. We were understanding of the wait since we had a large group. She proceeded to take the orders of our preteens without checking if they were on the same tickets so there was confusion when my son and my best friend's kid had the 2 for $25. Then it took an additional 15 minutes for her to bring my 1 year old a juice box and everyone had gotten their drinks and getting seconds. She brought my friend a watered down long island and when he ordered top shelf it was even worse. So she called her self talking to the bartender who proceeded to literally put 2 drops in it as they both laughed, not knowing we could see them. When questioned she became speechess. We then requested to speak to the manager as she tried to lie and say that's not what happened. Our food was cold, and the manager Zac tried to make it right. The only problem is the night was ruined and appetites were lost. They tried to offer free deserts but not even the kids wanted to be there any longer. It took forever to get our to go boxes and checks. I don't recommend this place for it poor customer service, but if you go avoid Brianna V.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=20,2.48,2.8,2.8,,2.672

The manager came over and tried making excuses for why it was there. In the end, they still had to pay for their food, which I thought was bull. Now for our table, my husband ordered a steak stir fry, or whatever it's called. When it came out, it was literally just rice, broccoli and steak. No sauce, super super dry. It's supposed to be a stir fry?? We told our waitress and the manager came over and asked what was wrong. After we explained it to her, she sarcastically asked if our water tasted okay.

69,Lin D.,"San Diego, CA",224,157,27.0,2.0,2017-10-26,"This place is one of the BEST non-customer service I have ever experienced! It was a Wednesday. Not too busy.  Coworkers and I sat down for some drinks and food after work. We sat at the bar, since we were only doing appetizers and really just wanted to have a couple drinks. (Trust me, you'd want a drink after our work days too) We were fair warned by another patron at the restaurant about how bad the service was. We left it go, ""maybe it will be different with us."" 15 minutes after sitting down, still no one. (Not even for water) We set our menus to the side and continued our conversation. 20 minutes later, FINALLY, someone came. We made our drink order, server was nice, no complaints. Except our drinks took a little too long. I'm unsure if they had to go to another country for the tequila, or if they were just........ slow. Margarita's WEAK btw. I know this, so I ordered a beer.  Order food. Came out normally. I had to ASK FOR NAPKINS AND FORKS. Didn't ask how we were doing. If we needed anything else. Just drop food and turn around and go. That's what robots do. They also don't get tips. Choose wisely servers/runners. (I used to work in a restaurant over 10 years ago, so I know how YOU are suppose to be) Drinks came out slowly but it was probably a good idea, since I down beer like water.  Long story short, we talked to the manager and he was kind enough to give us a discount and apologized (this was excellent since a lot of places don't; please see other reviews). Will I go back? Let's just say the time I went to this place before this time was over a year ago. So it may be about a year or so before I go back. There is better restaurants with better service.  This place needs to teach their servers that their job is to SERVE/SERVICE. SERVER = SERVE/SERVICE. If you don't like you're job, you should probably get a job at like Walmart, because like the honey badger, they don't give a s*** either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3,2.4,2.81,2.81,,2.646

The manager Francisco Lorenzo provided such a great service to each and every customer in his restaurant by continously asking every customer in his location if the food and service was good and at there expectations, which no manager is required to do that. Being in management it really amazed me that Francisco was able to handle a really bad situation with a customer that apparently just wanted free food,  Francisco multiple times tried to fix the issue with great patience and providing great service. The bartender Sophia was an amazing bartender she provided great service and great drinks!! Micah was also a great server went unfortunately he had to deal with unhappy and ignorant customers. Overall, I usually would go to chilis for food and drinks  but honestly after observing the great  service and how amazingly the staff are able to multi task and handle situations out of there control I will BE COMING HERE ON A DAILY BASIS AND BECOME A LOYAL CUSTOMER NOW BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE!!!
