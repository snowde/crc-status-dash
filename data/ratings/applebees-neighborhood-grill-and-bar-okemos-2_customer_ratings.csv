17,Jennifer H.,"Holt, MI",18,47,30.0,1.0,2012-10-08,"Yes, Applebee's is just a run of the mill chain, but I felt the need to write a review since this one is exceptionally bad.  The food- same as any other Applebee's.   What's horrible here is the service.  Very slow, inattentive, aloof waitstaff.  On our recent visit, out waiter served us cold food that clearly sat forever because he was too busy chatting up the hostess.  No drink refills and he checked on us once- after we were ready to just leave.  We won't be back.  I've never had good service (or even adequate service) at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
12,William K.,"Golf, IL",38,53,16.0,1.0,2013-07-14,"Eating here was my fault for not consulting Yelp first. The three previous reviewers were spot on, I should have stepped out after waiting at the door for a few minutes, This place was FAR from being busy, the host tried to move me to the bar, (In hindsight this might have been a good idea) as I waited for a server, I waited for a menu, I waited for my meal, and I waited for my check. My $2.99 lemonade never was refilled, I had a booth near the kitchen, it was like I was camouflaged to the staff there. It seemed like the staff was more interested in socializing then serving anyone. Avoid this location unless you like non-existent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
15,Courtney E.,"East Lansing, MI",0,6,,1.0,2013-08-20,"Went in on Sunday evening and we were seated at a hightop and provided with menus and a promise that our waitress would be right with us. After ten minutes of no acknowledgement from any waitstaff, the manager walked by, clearly looked at our empty table and continued to casually stroll by until we waved her over and asked for our waitress.  After another five minutes, I stood up to leave and a waitress approached the table. When she was asked if she was our waitress, she proceeded to roll her eyes and give a snotty ""yeah"" in reply. Clearly, we interrupted her smoke break and we were an inconvenience to her. After a conversation with the manager, we left and moved onto Stillwater Grill where we had attentive and polite staff with a delicious meal. Sorry Applebee's but your food isn't good enough to put up with inconsiderate and slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
16,John H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,3.0,2014-04-05,Service was better the previous reviews. However I note that have a grand reopening going on now. The pretzel app is the best I have had and I am a pretzel expert:). I would go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
18,Josh S.,"Meridian Charter Township, MI",0,6,,1.0,2014-08-29,Slow service.  Obnoxiously loud music.  Disengaged waitstaff.  Why did I go here when Cracker Barrel was right next door?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
9,Ian B.,"Indianapolis, IN",247,271,806.0,2.0,2014-11-13,"So my review is a little different than the rest. I have never ordered food here...becuase of the other reviews i never did. I have been here quiet a few times though only to drink. And that is why i decided to do this review. I have gotten good service at the bar and the drinks are fine, beer and shots..nothing special. Though what i have noticed every time I've been there is that the staff cannot manage the amount of people that come in at the dinner rush. Consistently there are people waiting longer than normal for takeout food, people waiting for a drink longer than normal and i hear a lot of people complaining. I have had to wait more than once for a long time just to get a refill on a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
14,Mark H.,"Mason, MI",7,5,,1.0,2015-01-09,"We went to Applebees in Okemos last night for the first time in a year.  The menu has completely changed and I didn't feel for the better.  Ordered the ribs and they were terrible.  Dry, burnt and small.  Service was ok but really disappointed in food our able ordered.  It may be more than a year before we go back.  Too bad, used to be one of our favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
11,Richard B.,"Mason, MI",0,13,4.0,1.0,2015-02-28,"I recently took my family to the Applebees in Okemos Mi and thought I should review my experience.  Pros:  1.) Good atmosphere. 2.) Good food. 3.) Good customer service.  Cons: 1.) The menue is shrinking.  2.) The food is getting more expensive.  3.) You pay more for less at this applebees.  We had a staff member open the door for us when we entered the building and were seated right away for lunch which was nice.  We ordered an appetizer (The Sampler) and was told that the sampler would no longer be on the menu soon. We received the app 20 minutes later. When we were asked if we were ready to order our dinner, we were told ""We don't have that anymore"" on several items that were still on the menu... Applebees is stripping out there menu of anything that is ""Not Healthy"" but keeping fries and ribs???  When I received my dinner, there was barely any food on the plate! My family (4 year old daughter and wife) barely had any food on their plates as well and the bill was unusually high.  Applebee's use to be an enjoyable family restaurant with good food for a reasonable cost but now seems to lack food options, and increased the prices.     I paid the bloated bill and left still hungry.  If you are a small guy with a tiny stomach and like paying top dollar for small portions of food, this is the place for you.  Come on Applebee's.... If I want to eat healthy, I will go eat at a health place. Applebee's should have taken some feedback from its customers before destroying a great menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
10,Stacy B.,"Woodhaven, MI",0,6,,1.0,2015-08-30,"My husband and I stopped here on our way home from camping....I will never go back! My husband had a hair in his food, and our waitress was not great either! I would not recommend this place at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
4,Shana S.,"South Lyon, MI",57,10,12.0,2.0,2015-11-09,"Service was very slow. It took about 10 minutes for her to greet us. Same pace throughout the meal. She didn't smile. We have two young children, the kids menu is awesome.  Every meal we ordered didn't come out how we ordered it. Mac and cheese with tenders came with sauce on tenders. Kids hate the sauce. Hence, why I ordered it sauce on side. We ordered the Monday special burgers for 6.99$ and came out well done. We ordered med and med rare.  The manager cleared our appetizer plates. We hoped the manager would have come back by to see how our meal was, It wasn't very busy.but never did.  If we stopped at this exit again we would for sure go to Cracker Barrel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
7,Mike F.,"Twin Lakes, WI",43,51,245.0,4.0,2016-03-31,"Awesome! I have been here a few times, and I have never had a bad meal or bad service. The food is good and the service is great! Plus they have Happy Hour from 3 to 6PM! Check in using Yelp and get a free appetizer! I mean, come on! What more do you want?!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
6,Joe S.,"Castaic, CA",53,75,370.0,4.0,2016-05-07,"A PLEASANT SURPRISE: This weekend marks the end of my son's first semester at Michigan State University. On my multiple trips up to campus I'd see food options within a short drive to try instead of the same old, same old. Off Exit 110, a number of food options exist and we chose Applebee's for burger options for him and standard American options for me. The Crispy Brewhouse Chicken offered a twist on the chicken-fried steak by amping up the crunch with the breading, sweet onion rings and herbs atop a tangy barbecue or red gravy atop mashed potatoes. Really enjoyed that the meal wasn't the typical brand-chain-salty or super-under in terms of seasoning. Well balanced in terms of season, the crunch was the dominant ,delicious note prominent in this meal. If you've read my burger barnstorm series, you'd know my son is a serious burger guy and in this case he gave the cheeseburger a big thumbs up. Simple, topped with American cheese he powered through it over a dinner of catching up for lost time. Good times indeed, yo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
8,Emily E.,"Lansing, MI",4,13,17.0,5.0,2016-07-31,I'm a regular here. Typically at the bar having a drink and wings during happy hour! Sam and Colin are both great attentive bartenders and do a wonderful job of taking care of customers.  As for food...it's Applebee's....but the service definitely deserves 5 stars !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
2,John E.,"Beverly Hills, MI",29,34,33.0,2.0,2016-08-21,"There were 8 of us for lunch. Place is right off i96. It was not very busy.

5,Christine M.,"Conklin, MI",3,4,,2.0,2017-07-24,"Too good of a story NOT to be told.  Ok, my kids and I went in for dinner around 8 not busy but long wait for food.  I ordered Pepper encrusted sirlon with grains medium rare.  It came after a long wait and it was well done so I returned it.  Second one came out after everyone else had finished eating and it was rare not medium rare but I wasn't sending it back .....  UNTIL I couldn't cut any of the pieces there was so much grizzle and fibers that the pieces were not edible, I gave up.  I waited to return it, finally did, waited some more, cook came out for explaination  and she removed my meal from my bill and then offered my kids a free dessert to go because she didn't want any sad faces for them.....um they ate why would they be sad lol, I said we had to get going but she said it'll be quick.....nope it wasn't so she brings them to go and I pay my portion due, tip my waiter and I'm off.....the clincher here is *I* didn't get a free dessert lmao   I mean why not through a dessert in there for the lady that didn't get dinner.  Weird management style, slow service and just a bad deal altogether.  Things happen, I get it but the story is too good not to share.  Eat at this location expecting not so great things.  We love Applebees but this location was no Bueno.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
1,Hope D.,"Waterford Township, MI",3,24,,3.0,2017-09-19,"Typical Applebee's fare, average service, average food. Not disappointed, but not really delicious for the price, either. Had to stop to eat somewhere off the freeway, and this seemed like the best choice compared to the other restaurants around, mostly fast food. We had the lunch specials, mostly chicken strips (not sure where the mac and cheese was that I expected) and the oriental salad. My brother had soup and salad. His soup came very hot and salad looked better than mine. Just your typical Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okemos-2,,,,,
