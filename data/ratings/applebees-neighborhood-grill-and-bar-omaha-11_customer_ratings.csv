1,Jim W.,"Omaha, NE",22,17,,5.0,2012-06-29,"This was a spur of the moment decision and at a place that is close to my home, but for some reason have not eaten there often.  THAT is going to change.  We stopped by right at a busy time (5:30 PM) and there was a person there to open the door with a big ""Welcome to Applebee's"" greeting that sounded sincere and not canned.  One in the door we were greeted again very sincerely, my name taken and offered the option of being seated immediately in the bar section or waiting for a table.  I choose to wait and was offered a seat.   We were seated promptly, and as soon as the host left, the server came up, once AGAIN welcomed us to Applebees, intro ducted himself, pointed out the specials, and ask for our drink order.  We had our drinks in probably less than two minutes. Since we knew what we wanted we went ahead and ordered.  One of my favorite dishes there is the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  Tip here, they have a ""half size"" and a ""full size"".  The difference appears to be the fact that you get two more chicken strips (6 vs 4) on the salad and their is a $2. difference.  Honestly, the half size is more than adequate.  Save the $2 towards dessert! The food was served quickly and it was very good.  Totally no complaints. Our beverages were kept full to the point at the end of the meal we had to say NO so as not to waste it.   We did not have dessert this time, but if it's like most Applebees, a little on the pricey side, but also very good. As you can tell, I was most impressed with this store.  I have eaten at the one on 78th and Dodge and the One on North 72nd and this one was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11?start=20,,,,,

3,Angie G.,"Omaha, NE",1,2,,1.0,2014-10-16,This was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The waitress was awful checked on us once when she gave us our drinks once to get our order and once to get our check. She wreaked like cigarettes everytime she came to our table. The food was over salted. I will not be going back. EVER!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11?start=20,,,,,
24,Zach W.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,1.0,1.0,2014-11-03,"This was easily one of the top 3 worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant.  Everything was atrocious from the server to the manager to the timing of the food.  It took 15 minutes for us to flag our server down to place our food order.  She seemed to be more akin to a magician than a server at a restaurant because she would just disappear for seemingly endless amounts of time.  It took  30 minutes from the point of our order to receive our appetizer (Queso!!!!).  And 50 minutes from point of order to get our food (I wear a watch).  What was even worse, my dad's food came out with the appetizer, but my girlfriend's food and mine did not come out for another 20 minutes!!!!! Hence why i said it took 50 minutes to get the food.   The manager argued with me and told me ""that is to be expected since the appetizer we ordered was not part of the 2 for $20 appetizers that they make a lot of"".  So apparently Queso Blanco takes 30 minutes to make?????  She also said ""Yes, since you ordered an appetizer it pushes your food back some"".  I asked her if 50 minutes was acceptable for a dinner entree and she just kept blaming me for ordering an appetizer and stating that was the reason it took so long.   The only thing she took responsibility for was my dad's food coming with the appetizer.  So she comped his food, but not anything else. I would also like to note that every table in our section was having similar problems, and I specifically heard the same manager talking to those tables and saying she would take things off their bill, etc.  So this was not just an isolated incident with our table.  Also, our server said she was brand new, and was HORRIBLY in-attentive.  She didn't even realize we didn't have our main entrees until 20 minutes after the appetizer came.  And she forgot my drink among other things.  She even told me at one point that she saw the manager throw away our food, and that it was going to have to be re-made because it was ""bumped"" and no one noticed.   I think the worst part about the whole thing is that it made what was supposed to be a relaxing dinner with my father and my girlfriend into a stressful and horrible evening...and we had to pay for that horrible evening.  I feel like I would have been better off with a PB&J sandwich in front of my TV. It was absolutely ridiculous, and I hope I am never forced to go back to this location ever again.  And I will make sure everyone I know hears about this horrible night out to Applebees.  It really is a shame since we have been going here for so many years.  Fortunately, there are 8-10 similar restaurants within a 3 mile radius. My family and friends will just go to one of them from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
25,Kris J.,"Omaha, NE",0,9,3.0,3.0,2015-04-19,"It always seems to me that no matter what Applebee's I go to its either hit or miss. Wait was 15 mins which they were busy so we expected it, the place in general just seemed crowed and not the best for a wheelchair although it is accessible. Our spinach artichoke dip was amazing but the main course items was just alright, more personal preference than anything. The waiter was nice and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,

21,Rachel A.,"Kearney, NE",154,6,,3.0,2015-11-17,Good food and our server Bobby seemed new but was very nice. There was a server or host and he seemed very under the influence of something. He kept yelling/dancing on people/just being very inconsiderate of everyone around him. The people next to us when we sat down told us they were going to walk out because of him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
0,Sherrie L.,"Omaha, NE",0,11,,1.0,2015-12-31,"We called to place a ""to go"" order.  Of the three meals we wanted to order, one of the items they had on their online menu was no longer available.  Once we placed our order, we were told it would be 45 minutes.  45 minutes later when we went to pick up our order, they could not find our order until they finally realized that they had it under a different (wrong) name--we still ended up waiting 20 minutes more at the restaurant.  When they brought our order, they only had 2 of the 3 meals and could not find that we had ordered the third.  They had side dishes wrong for the two meals we did get.  We chose to not wait another 20 minutes for the third meal.  We have been to Applebee's before and had ok experiences--this was just not a good experience at all.  Will not go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11?start=20,,,,,
18,Jennifer Y.,"Omaha, NE",7,60,19.0,1.0,2016-04-04,"This was legitimately my worst dining experience of all time.. Nobody was friendly or acted like they even cared about their job.. We got 5 or 6 different people to our table, pretty much a different server every time. Multiple people took our order, and each one did so while partially walking away from us. When our appetizers came, they were incomplete and we had no plates or silverware. We had to flag a woman down to get some & she didn't seem very pleased to accommodate us. Some time after we finished our appetizers, a server comes and brings us our checks, and ask us how our food was - but we hadn't even gotten our food yet, so then another long wait later we get our food, cold, and also incomplete, so we had to then flag down another person for our ketchup, ranch, fries & refills.. which then took another ages long wait to receive. Then, when it's actually time for our check, we are continually ignored for some time longer, and when we had finally got it, we'd had enough & asked to speak to a manager. The manager was very apologetic & even comped our food, but the overall experience needs to be both shared & rectified. It was a bust, nothing went well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
8,Royal B.,"Omaha, NE",424,256,17.0,2.0,2016-08-09,"Cleanliness 3 Service 2 Food 3 Likelihood 1 1-5 (5 Best!) 2.3 The culture has changed here.  This used to be a good running location.  We were sat at a table that had not been wiped off, and the chairs were dirty.  We sat for many minutes.  I finally got up to go get a server, when he finally arrived.  We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and dinner.  It took a while to get our drinks.  Manager stopped by to apologize for service and said it that is not acceptable. Both my water and iced tea went empty many times.  I sent my pulled pork sandwich back after two small bites, as there was more ham, cheese, and bacon on it than there was pulled pork.  Service remained slow.  Two more friends joined us for drinks, we watched their drinks sit at the bar for a long period of time before the server appeared to bring them to us.  The bar tenders wiped the glasses free of condensation (hint, DELIVER THEM!) The atmosphere was VERY causal, and customer service is not part of their culture.  Truly, if poor service was not acceptable, our outcome would have been different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
19,Phillip H.,"Omaha, NE",0,13,,3.0,2016-08-12,"We go to Applebee's a lot. It has a great deal of variety. It goes through stages of menu changes, some we approve of, some we are disappointed in. The last round of changes has been for the better. There are some really good new stuff and the appetizers, while getting smaller, are also cheaper and very good.  This last visit we both got the Brewhouse Chicken....it is very good. The chicken is good, the potatoes are good and the gravy is great.  I also like the new nachos on the appetizer menu.  The only thing standing between that visit and four stars was the service. Generally the service is great and we have even gotten to know some of the servers by name. These were not them. This one took offense to my wife's concern with the lateness of the appetizer was just kind of weird. Might be ""new person"" jitters are their part. It won't prevent us from coming back... The payment device was broken at our table so we paid the check the old fashioned way. That's okay too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
17,Carol P.,"Omaha, NE",23,13,,1.0,2016-08-19,"We have been to this location several times and the food is mediocre to bad. The staff is always dishelved and unkempt. Today was our final visit after being served a cockroach in the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. The manager sat down at the table to examine the bug while we tried not to throw up at the sight of the roach drowning in the cheese sauce. She comped our meal and we immediately left. My daughter, who had eaten part of the meal, threw up in the parking lot. Never will I eat at any Applebee's again! GROSS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,

6,James G.,"Omaha, NE",3,30,13.0,5.0,2016-11-23,"This visit was wonderful. Stephanie was our server tonight and she was fabulous. I had the fiesta chicken, while my companion had the chicken cavatappi. We chose from the BOGO menu, which made the price less than $7 per entrée. Incredible! To end the meal, blue ribbon brownie with ice cream and yummy fudge. I utterly LOVE fudge. And here I sit after the meal, stuffed and satisfied. This was an excellent experience. As Ahnold said, I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
12,Melissa A.,"Omaha, NE",39,139,115.0,5.0,2016-11-23,"Outstanding for a mid-range casual chain. Had the 3 cheese cavatappi on the BOGO deal. My companion had the lime chicken. Both were very tasty, portions were just right. Not bad when you consider $12.49 fed both of us. BUT we also each added a strawberry sparkler. Real strawberries! Totally yummy. THEN we split the blue ribbon brownie. Sublime. But absolutely food meant for gods when you put a bite of the fudgy concotion on your tongue then take sip of the strawberry sparkler...oh my! All of this combined with a great server, Stephanie, and we had really good experience her. We will be back and feel quite comfortable recommending it to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
20,Mike K.,"Bennington, NE",0,79,,4.0,2017-02-13,"Pros -Nice Servers. -Quality food -Comfortable Seating  Cons -Very Busy Horrible Parking I'm a student posting of Mr. Krambeck.I really enjoy applebee's food and the atmosphere. Applebee's is a moderate family friendly eating environment. Times to avoid when coming applebee's is from 6:00-7:30 Pm. Some food on the menu is really overpriced but some are underpriced like the salad. They have a kids menu for your young people who can't order of the adult menu.  When I went to applebee's I ordered the All American Standard Burger. It comes with two patties, a piece of cheese, onion rings, and the applebee's special sauce. It is probably one of the most flavorful meals you can get at applebee's. What also comes with the burger is either a choice between fries, and onion rings. None of the meals come with a drink so you'll have to buy our own which is $2.50 for a pop and $1.75 for a water or milk. For dessert they have a wide range of delicious options to pick from like the Triple Brownie Ice Cream Sundae which is absolutely amazing. The overall food there is really good they also have a gluten-free menu if you are allergic to gluten My overall experience every time I ago is positive. The waitresses and waiters are always nice and helpful. The food is usually really good and warm whenever they bring it out to you. I would recommend Applebee's to anyone is looking for a delicious night out with the family or with your friends. Another review from one of my 8th grade students... Pros Great food Refilled drinks Wasn't too busy Family friendly Hospitable Large portions Cons Food took a while to come out Drink refill took too long On New Year's Eve, I ate at Applebee's on West Maple Road with my family. Applebee's is a chain restaurant with locations all across the country. They serve comfort food such as pasta, burgers, wings, and chips with dip. Their menu has a wide variety of options and they have great deals such as the 2 for $20 (two entrees+an appetizer) and half apps (half priced appetizers after 10 o'clock).  We arrived at around 5:30 and surprisingly it wasn't very busy at all. Only a few tables and booths were occupied. But, it was a little early and while we were there, it started to fill up. Our waiter was very polite and didn't hover or rush us while we tried to decide what to eat. The food did take a little long to come out but it wasn't too bad because we ordered an appetizer. My dad and I ordered the 2 for $20 deal, we both got the ""Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi"" and an order of mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks had a crunchy breading on the outside and warm, gooey cheese in the center. Those were very, very good. The portions were large and filling. The dish had such great, savory flavor that I didn't want to stop eating it. It was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. It's a great place to go when you're hanging out with friends or having dinner with the family. They have dishes for everyone, it is unlikely that you won't find something there that you'll absolutely love. The service is great and there is an abundance of food and drink choices. The price is very reasonable and they often have deals and combos that make it even better. I give Applebee's 4 out of 5 stars. I love this place and I hope you will too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
7,Brandon S.,"Omaha, NE",93,50,61.0,1.0,2017-03-08,"Worst experience every! Not only did the service take forever the waitress was being extremely rude! Waite over 13 mins for a glass of water once I was given wrong drank for her being mad that I had her take it back. Then finally I sit and wait while everyone eats their food for mine as they ""accidentally made it with wrong sauce""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
13,Shannon W.,"Lincoln, NE",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-10,"I wish I knew the name of my server so I could recommend to you to ask for another server if you are sat in her section. I understand from working in the food industry that people will do illegal things during shift. But this wasn't the server being high, this was the server being on drugs! It was UNBEARABLE the way she was acting! Always sit at the bar! They put their ONLY good servers behind there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
9,Alexis R.,"Omaha, NE",278,3,,1.0,2017-04-18,This by far has been the WORST experience I have ever had. They took forever getting our food out to us. And by forever I mean over 45 minutes. I will NEVER come here again. Our waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about or what she was doing. I don't recommend eating here unless you have a couple hours to spend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,
10,Curt W.,"West Omaha, Boys Town, NE",2,22,2.0,1.0,2017-04-28,"Food was not up to par even for Applebees. In West Omaha your late night dining options are extremely limited. This Applebee's was lacking in service but the real issue was the food was dry, and really short of flavor. We had brew pretzels with beer cheese as an app but the pretzels were way over cooked. My Whiskey River BBQ burger was missing the BBQ sauce. Not going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,,,,,

Mom got the Cedar salmon and it was too dry, mashed potatoes weren't warm, and sauce for the salmon was gross. I got the spinach & artichoke cavatappi with chicken and it was meh. It came out nice and warm. I liked the grilled chicken on it but that was it.  Jeremy was our waiter and did good job!

14,Brittanie R.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,2.0,1.0,2017-06-04,"One of the worst visits yet. I keep giving this place a chance because it's so close to home and tonight I was just trying to catch a quick couple appetizers with my girlfriend. It took a couple minutes to get seated, it wasn't busy, the hostess was just MIA. Once we were seated our waitress seemed less than pleased to have anymore customers come in. We asked for a couple waters, I went to wash my hands and came back and still waited 5 more minutes for waters. She placed our order for two appetizers and a salad then never bothered to come back to our table. We waited 20 minutes for our salads and the waitress hadn't even bothered to check on our order. She was too busy eating her mozzarella sticks and rolling her eyes as the hostess placed another couple in her section. So whoever had the west side of the building with the booths by the windows is an awful server! This visit was the worst and last I will ever make at this location. Too bad I'll have to drive across town the next time I want spinach artichoke dip! Mcdonalds it is!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-11,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
