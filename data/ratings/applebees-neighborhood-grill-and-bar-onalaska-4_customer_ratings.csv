17,Rebecah M.,"La Crosse, WI",2,205,,2.0,2012-05-14,Typical chain restaurant.   The waitstaff was exceptional. They are trying a new Weight Watchers menu and the jalepeno-lime shrimp was one of the better chain restaurant meals that I have had.  Everything else on the menu is pretty much bacon and BBQ sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
21,Nathan P.,"Racine, WI",0,9,,1.0,2012-10-22,Had a bad experience with very slow service food was ok typical chain restaurant but didn't get a refill for 20 mins and it wasn't even busy. Poorly trained staff,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
11,Samantha C.,"Minneapolis, MN",54,56,50.0,1.0,2013-01-01,"Went there on new years day. Signed in with the Hostess for a table of two. Asked if we could sit at on of the tables in the bar section, she said that there was one group ahead of us and and that they would be seated there. I replied with and OK, and asked if we could grab the next available table in the bar area, since it was being cleaned when I asked, and she replied with a sure. Next thing we know the couple BEHIND us, who was AFTER US, was SEATED at the Table in the bar that I had JUST REQUESTED. thinking.... ok, that wasn't right. The hostess claimed that we never asked for the table in the bar. I was so disgusted with the hostess we left. I will NEVER eat here, especially since it was a first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
22,Alan M.,"Trempealeau, WI",15,5,,1.0,2013-05-01,Waitress messed up on the order entering into the system and ordered pepperoni pizza instead of cheese pizza.  My steak was ordered medium and came well done and the waitress did not have to have a new steak fired.  Baked potato was not cooked through and my wife's mojito was not drinkable.  Worst few and service we have ever had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
2,David A.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,2013-08-16,If I want to blow 10-15 dollars on food that looks like it came from a $2 Swanson TV dinner then I will just buy a Swansons TV dinner and flush the remaining $8-13 down the toilet because that's where it's going anyways and I'll give myself the tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4?start=20,,,,,
1,Katie A.,"Hartford, WI",0,10,,4.0,2013-09-15,"Wow.  I am surprised by all of the bad reviews.  I have only been to this particular Applebees a couple of times, but have never had a major issue here or at any of the other Applebee's Restaurants.  I love their half-price appetizers, especially the veggie patch pizza.  Last time I went to Applebee's I discovered the veggie patch pizza was no longer on the menu, but our waiter was able to get one for me anyways!  I call that good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4?start=20,,,,,
20,Sheila J.,"Onalaska, WI",0,10,,1.0,2014-05-04,Ordered a soda and tap beer. The waitress brought out the soda but no beer and the other person at the table then ordered appetizer which came out and my beer still was not to the table. It took twenty minutes for the drink to get to the table... Wow... There were other things that happened that were also frustrating. I have been here before and this place is average at best. I would have a hard time ever recommending this place to anybody!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
12,J D.,"Burleson, TX",1,72,2.0,1.0,2014-06-11,"All I really want to say is disgusting! But I'll go on in detail: 1)  So overpriced it's magical. I mean really, 13-14 bucks for a pasta meal at a typical chain store. 2)  I really couldn't taste my food beyond the salt taste. 3)  Servers hardly stopped by to ask if we needed anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
19,Nick W.,"Saint Paul, MN",66,3,2.0,2.0,2014-07-21,Got the bourbon chicken and shrimp. Didn't taste any bourbon sauce. The side of potatoes was tiny. Not very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
0,Concerned C.,"La Crosse, WI",0,10,,1.0,2015-01-27,"My husband and I went into applebees one night at 10pm cuz I wanted some mozz sticks.  After 10 they are 1/2 off.  I ordered the platter that came with other items, one being 5 little chicken chunks and another being 4 or 5 mozz sticks.  The waitress said they were out of mozz sticks.  I said I really came in for those so since you don't have those can I get double on the chicken since I won't get any mozz sticks.  She said let me check.  It took her quite a while to get back to us cuz she said she could not find who she needed to ask. Finally she came back and said no, they can only replace the mozz sticks with extra quesadillas, which I don't even like.  So I said no thanks and we left.  So basically they would not give 5 extra little chunks of chicken in place of mozz sticks that they were out of by their own fault.  Ridiculous.  We have a large family of 6 with 2 teenage boys and usually come in there during the week and have a bill of $75 plus.  and that night my husband and I would have got the apps and he would have ordered a regular priced meal plus 2 sodas and other apps.  Such fools!!!  We won't go back ever after that.  Had problems in the past with other things but gave them many chances, done with them now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4?start=20,,,,,
15,Elysia M.,"La Crosse, WI",3,7,5.0,1.0,2015-05-24,Had to wait 20 minutes to order drinks. Ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was fruit punch with strawberries in it. Wonton tacos were good but for 1/2 price apps I would still like someone to offer a refill on my drink. We only had a party of 7 and yet the place was slow and had to wait constantly. The waiter had a full section but all the other staff walked by not offering help. Bartender was a jerk! We wanted to give this place another shot for a good place top go after work but will have to find a place that cares for their customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
18,Barbra M.,"La Crosse, WI",1,28,,1.0,2015-06-15,"Nasty, nothing but nasty. Really, are they still a franchise?!  I know the workers are trying to make a living. Try to do something else. My best wishes to the Applebee worker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
8,Rory S.,"Tomah, WI",39,27,3.0,2.0,2016-01-30,Seems like every other Applebees.  Did not expect the loud drunk lady at the bar at 2pm.  After waiting 20 minutes for our food I'm now staring at a hot plate of food with no silverware to eat it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
16,David L.,"Onalaska, WI",0,4,,1.0,2016-01-31,Why throw gasoline on the fire?  Because our car side to go was horrible.  What else can I say.  Dave,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
10,Andy G.,"La Crosse, WI",16,7,,1.0,2016-02-06,"The last time i went here we had a party of four and there were two other tables. It was around 7pm. It took an hour and 45 minutes to get our food, which was all cold. During the wait, our waitress stopped by once to refill drinks. After we got our cold food the manager stopped by to offer us each a free dessert, which we thought was nice. That took another 45 minutes, and again the hot desserts were completely cold. None of us have been back since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
13,Rachel F.,"Decorah, IA",105,6,87.0,5.0,2016-02-13,Despite the bad reviews we went anyway because we couldn't find table downtown that wasn't an hour wait (not a bad problem to have!!) .. we had called for a table for 8 - they had it ready for us when we got there and our server was excellent. I definitely liked the new tablets that they have at the tables for you to preorder your appetizers. Hopefully this place starts getting better reviews soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
7,Kerri J.,"New London, WI",5,53,11.0,1.0,2016-03-02,"Went here with my husband, nephew and daughter despite reading the reviews, thought we would try it anyway.  My husband and I ordered the Parmesan Steak and Shrimp. We both had the mashed potatoes and vegetables. The mashed potatoes were ice cold and the veggies were rock hard, the steak wasn't great either. The waitress brought us out more potatoes but it was way too late and we were ready to leave. She put them in a Togo container. Very disappointed. won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
14,Denise J.,"Onalaska, WI",106,12,,1.0,2016-03-30,"Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE behavior by FOH Manager Ryan.  My daughter was an employee for almost 4 years and has worked at various locations,  with various titles.  Always dependable and never a complaint.  She started at 16 at the location near home,  then transferred when she moved to La Crosse to attend the university.  She initially had no problems,  as she transferred as a cook.  The problems started when she learned to serve and started reporting to Ryan. Hours were very limited,  shortly after she started. However,  this was not because of not being needed,  it was personal. Ryan was overheard saying "" I can't wait for those lesbians to quit "" as another server was talking about my daughters girlfriend,  who also worked there,  putting her 2 weeks notice in.  I guess he felt that if they didn't get hours eventually they would quit. Which ended up happening.  Unbelievable how rude and disrespectful someone in a position of authority can be!  Completely unacceptable. Applebee's lost a very good employee that day,  all because of the shallow and ignorant personal feelings he let interfere in his professionalism. Had I not been a mature adult,  I would most definitely have went to jail,  and perhaps him to the morgue. This is the year 2016, and same sex marriage is even recognized as legal.  Let's not judge others.  Since then,  both me and my daughter have filed formal complaints with Lauren in HR, who seems to not be taking this matter seriously. No communication to either of us since initial conversations. Absolutely disgusting business practices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
9,H P.,"La Crosse, WI",0,12,,2.0,2016-05-13,"With the menu change, I thought perhaps the service and the food improved. As it turns out, the food was pretty good but the service was still poor. I also question the cleanliness. As we were escorted to the table, we walked on a sticky discolored carpet. After, we realized its the area in and out of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
6,Harrison H.,"West Salem, WI",39,3,,1.0,2016-06-07,"We dined on 6-6-16 around 7PM.  The place was not that busy, and it still took around an hour to get our food.  When the food arrived half of it was luke warm.  One of the plates has what appeared to be red juice or jam smeared on it.  The waitress dropped the food and left,  not to be seen again until everyone was finished.   When she returned she asked if we'd like our drinks refilled, but it was too late and her tip fate had been sealed.  No managers made there presence known, which is strange for this chain.  We will not be visiting this Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
5,Sara S.,"Winona, MN",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-08,"This restaurant is a zero on customer service. I have food allergies. I notified waiter of my allergy before I ordered and told him I had back up choices if the first wouldn't work. He arrogently told me my choice wouldn't be a problem without even checking. When our food finally arrived, not only did the entre' contain my allergen, but so did the salad dressing. We notified the manager who changed out the food. When the waiter finally went by, he didn't apologize for his attitude or his error.  He looked at my empty glass, stated that I needed more water and kept walking without checking with the other person at the table. When he brought the water, the glass was chipped with the chip hanging off. I had to call the manager again. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
3,Nicolle B.,"Crosslake, MN",0,33,,4.0,2017-07-28,Some of the friendliest Applebee's staff members I've come across. Food is tasty and comes in a timely manner. Restaurant has always been orderly and clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
4,Alysse T.,"Tomah, WI",157,3,,1.0,2017-09-30,"Went in tonight with my sister. They messed up her strawberry lemonade, I'm not sure how one does that. I got the spinach chicken pasta and the pasta/spinach was good. The chicken was half cooked. The only thing our waitress did was run our drinks and take our food order (which was done at the same time). We asked the host for her and they paged her right away. It took her 10 minutes to get back out to us. Disappointing. Won't eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-onalaska-4,,,,,
