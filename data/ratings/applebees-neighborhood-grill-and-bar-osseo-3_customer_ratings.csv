10,Michael R.,"Phillips, Minneapolis, MN",0,9,,5.0,2013-10-15,"Easily the best Applebee's in the Twin Cities metro area. Friendly staff, great ticket times (even on the weekend or during busy times), hot food, cold drinks and nobody beats price for the amount of quality food you receive. If you're in town looking for a solid chain restaurant you can trust, this is the one in the Maple Grove area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
11,Dan P.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,58,,2.0,2014-03-20,"Everyone should go to a place like Applebee's once in a while.  Dining here gives you a baseline reference to compare with other overpriced, industrial food complex, mediocre restaurants around town. Positives:  Server Catherine-pleasant and hard working.  Cold Newcastle Ale (tall- 6.29), Fried shrimp platter.  My chicken-shrimp-lime/chipotle entrée had a chance but for the little naked shrimps swimming around.  Negatives:  Worst french fries around-even when served hot.  They have an odd stale or non potato flavor.  How do you mess up fries so bad that a teenager won't eat them?  Boneless chicken wings appetizer- avoid.  The expediter food delivery process needs work- a couple hot items were delivered at room temp.  Sent em back.  Dining environment:  Crowded, tight seating arrangement-like coach seats on an airplane, nice lighting, plenty of TV's to watch NCAA's.  I don't guess there is a lot of cooking going on at Applebees- more of a heat/fry/assemble thing going on.  Ten years between visits is about right for me but the place was full on a Thursday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
5,kyle t.,"Maple Grove, MN",215,357,130.0,2.0,2014-10-14,"I think that we need to have a different word for places like this.  I see a restaurant as somewhere that people take raw products and make yummy food out of it.  Then there are places like Applebees where they take something from a box, a bag, a carton and warm it up to serve. Now I am not really saying there is anything wrong with this second type, although really there is.  I do know I want to avoid it when I can.  I stopped in for a beer and a quick bite while out for a bike ride, sounded pretty simple.  The result was a feeling you would normally get after an illness.   Nothing against the people that work here by the way.  The service was good, everyone was friendly and professional but the food sucks.  This is Costco, dropped back a step but served in a better fashion, well sort of.  This is the meal I can buy from a store and make myself, but chose not to.  This is a Prefabrant (OK, there's got to be something better).

9,Amy A.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,13,7.0,5.0,2015-01-19,"A friend and I stopped in for lunch on a whim.  To be truthful, I was not expecting a 'great' meal, but knew it would be good.  Well, this assumption was completely off in so many ways!  Our waitress Hannah was great, she offered suggestions according to what kind of 'meal' we were looking for and she totally nailed it for us both!  I got the New Pub Diet's Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken with Quinoa and it was a very satisfying  lightweight meal full of flavor.  My friend had the Thai Shrimp Salad and absolutely loved it too!  It is very rare for me to eat my whole meal while dining out, this was a time in which I cleared my plates and left very satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
8,Joe B.,"Dublin 8, Republic of Ireland",156,6,,1.0,2015-02-06,Worst fucking service I've ever had waited 20 mins at a booth for a server to even attempt to ask if four of us had been helped yet! Waited another 15 just for drinks and food order. Can't imagine a reality where I come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
7,Linda L.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,73,122.0,1.0,2015-04-18,"I can't believe it!  There are""BONES"" in my Fish & Chips order! There were two pieces of my fried fish that has bones in them!   I ordered Fish & Chips for take out!   1)  I saw the Fishes were over fried! 2)  on my first bite, I bite into bones!   I continued to bite into more bones on the same piece.  Therefore I checked other pieces before I bite into bones again.  I found another piece also have bones in them!   From what I know, Fish & Chips is boneless!   What the Hell?  What kind of Chef did they hire?  I paid $17 for the order, I expect my order to be not over fried (dark brown) and most important ""BONELESS"" Fish & Chips! I don't even want to give any Star to this restaurant, only because it's required by Yelp! Total disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
2,Jonathan H.,"Minneapolis, MN",294,355,62.0,5.0,2015-12-03,"I have been here a few times during their dinner hour.  I have always been a fan of Applebee's, and this place is no exception.  I have always enjoyed coming here with my family. This has an easy-to-miss location because it is away from most of the shops in the Arbor Lakes area, and it is oddly isolated-but-not-isolated (best way I can put it).  At first, I had to look closely at that area to find it.  It is easiest to find when driving along I-94.  Once it is found, locating it is easy from there on. I am usually skeptical about sports bars.  However, Applebee's manages to appeal to those who are not big sports fans.  This place is no exception.  The employees also have a great eye on cleanliness and order.  I have never had any major problems with walking into any messes.  Therefore, I always feel comfortable walking in there and enjoying a good meal. The employees are friendly, and they are excellent with approaching people.  Their approach is unique compared to other places because of their level of outgoingness.  They are almost always busy so they do not have much time to talk about things other than my order, which is understandable.  They are also great at any suggestions they may have. Their food is delicious!  My favorite is the steak cooked rare.  They serve their plates in a reasonable time.  I do not think that I have ever waited any longer than ten minutes, which I feel is reasonable.  I also enjoy their margaritas. When I am in the area and craving a good dinner with my family, I will continue keeping this place in mind.  I feel like I can count on this location for a good quality experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
3,Linh T.,"Rochester, MN",10,20,314.0,3.0,2016-06-22,On Monday -all burgers at apple's bee are only $6. The burgers were really good but the service wasn't good. There wasn't any staff that checked on us. I wanted to ask for ranch but no one walked across my table for me to ask. The artichoke dip wasn't that good; it tastes like Tostitos salsa cheese dip with processed artichoke,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
0,Eric S.,"Kansas City, MO",1,11,,5.0,2016-07-18,"Started early tonight.5:45 Party of one sitting at the bar. Not sure why this place has 3 star reviews. Very attentive bar tender, to the point she came by and repoured my perfect marg from the shaker when my glass was empty. Drink delivered in less than 3 mins and food followed about 5 mins later. All was great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,

4,Ry B.,"Osseo, MN",3,82,32.0,1.0,2016-07-31,"I know this is a chain but it took about 45 minutes to get our food here. Our waitress did her job but I still do not understand what took so long when the restaurant wasn't even busy. Two groups of people, who came in after us, got their food promptly. The experience was strange and my wife was very irritated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
1,Youa T.,"Minneapolis, MN",51,236,374.0,3.0,2017-11-27,"My friends and I stopped in for what we hoped would be a quick 1 hour dinner since we knew what we wanted and ordered right away. We all ordered off the 2 for $25. We got our salad then it took about 35-40 minutes to get our entree. During that time, our server did not stop at our table once. We didn't need him for anything but he was consistently looking our way but never stopped to check on us or apologized for the long wait. If we were in a hurry or really needed some more water we would've waved him down. About 30 minutes in, he looked at our table again and probably realized to think, maybe Ill go check on their order. 5 minutes later, our food came out, well, 3 out of the 4 orders came out. I ordered medium rare steak with fries and broccoli. Steak was barely even warm and so dry from probably sitting under the heat warmer or whatever the case was. My fries and broccoli was semi warm. My friend's medium steak was cooked and more dry than mines and her mashed potatoes were no longer hot. My friend's chicken and potatoes served on a sizzling hot skillet wasn't even sizzling when it came out. Then the last steak that was ordered by my other friend came out all piping hot and juicy and medium rare and her mashed potatoes were still hot and super tasty. Hmm, interesting. Our server came by and asked how everything was. I shrugged and said its fine. He knew something wasn't right because we were more cheerful earlier. I told our server our food was barely even warm. He did ask if we wanted something else but really, we already waited 40 minutes for our food after they took our salad plates away. Whether they were trying to pull a fast one to see if we would notice or say anything or they legit really didn't realize it, but I'm hoping they really legit didn't realize it. The manager even brought our food out too. Our server probably mentioned something to the manager and she came over to acknowledge what we said to our server and she apologized and said she would discount our bill. When we got our bill, we didn't expect the manager to comp a whole 2 for 25 meal. We still ended up tipping because whether it was the server or the cooks fault, we didn't expect to have them comp that much off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-osseo-3,,,,,
