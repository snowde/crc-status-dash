I still may not come here that often as it's not right around the corner, an I know better than to come here on a holiday like last time, but I'm glad to know that it's as good as I expect an Applebee's to be. We got here kinda early on a Saturday evening and they weren't very busy; our server greeted us and seated us; he was super sweet and very engaging. If you go and get seated in Brandon O's area, you will be well taken care of! Our food was hot and fresh and Brandon did not let our glasses get empty; he brought extra napkins and just acted like he was really happy to be there. I'm sure being a waiter isn't an easy job but the good ones make it look easy.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was; maybe he had just taken over because this was a total 180 from the last time we were there. I was a little hesitant at trying this place again but we were hoping it was just a fluke or maybe they were short staffed from the holiday and it looks like we were right. I like being right. It makes me happy. And  now this Applebee's makes me happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

And they put plenty of shrimp on the plate! My son loved the cheeseburger sliders. Very juicy and tasty. My mom liked the tortilla soup, tho she wished it had more cheese. My daughter sent back the Mac and cheese. They were very accommodating and replaced it with a kids corndog plate, which she liked.

I sometimes order the garlic mashed potato, sometimes the baked, but both cooked properly and not too much garlic on the mashed potatos.  My daughter is a pata freak so she orders the three cheese Chicken penne . She always has more than enough to take home. Good sized servings on all their meals.
