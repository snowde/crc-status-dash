4,Karen W.,"Curlew, IA",0,5,2.0,1.0,2014-02-27,Where do I begin?  This is the worst service I ever received at an Applebee's. The food was late burnt and cold. Our waitress SARAH M had excuses for everything. It wasn't even busy.  It took 7 minutes to get our drinks from the bar and we were right next to it.  Sad sad sad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
7,Eric L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,19,19.0,2.0,2014-06-27,The salads or excellence. the floor underneath our table  was dirty they kinda messed up the order but the food is tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
2,JJ D.,"Grays Harbor, WA",6,418,1.0,4.0,2014-08-27,"I went to Pella, hoping to find a great ""local"" restaurant.  After having a bad experience at another restaurant where I walked out, I came here.  Sheesh, I didn't go to Pella to eat at Applebees.  But it was here, so I stopped. Typical Applebees.  Got what I expected.  Ordered one of their ""Classic PLUS Signature"" combos.  Now I know why they have those BIG TALL MENUS.  The dishes look bigger on the menu.  When my order came, the dish looked quite small.  But it was good, and just what I needed for lunch.   Food server was professional and fun. No place to park an RV, although I noticed a 5th Wheel parked next door in the back lot of the Culver's restaurant.  I'd like to know how that 5th Wheel got in there, because, although Culver's had room, the entry TO the parking lot looked dicey.   I came here in a rental car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
3,D C.,"Winter Garden, FL",0,78,,2.0,2015-06-18,"I mean it's Applebee's so my expectations weren't super high, but it's a newer location (from appearance), so we gave it a whirl. Food was subpar, in comparison to other Applebee's. The wait staff made us feel like we were putting them out. (Felt this way when we dined at a table, as well as an at the bar experience.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
5,Tony L.,"Pella, IA",0,3,1.0,2.0,2015-10-23,"I agree with some of the other reviews.  I had a waitress today named Megan let's just say if she comes up to your table. Walk out.  She brought our food to the table and that was the last we saw of her, until she brought our check and grabbed our plates to clear them.  I had the ""endless"" fries. Well it is hard to get a refill on drink or fries when your waitress is no where to be found.  Not busy at all, as a matter of fact I did not hear others talking,or music playing,  all I remember is the disgusting sound of the bartender coughing every 10 seconds. GO HOME nobody wants you to handle their glasses, drinks, or lemon wedge sick like that.  Take a day off!!  Food was alright nothing impressive, it is Applebee's. Star rating was for services not for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
0,Bill G.,"Willow River, MN",47,39,8.0,3.0,2016-01-01,"This is your typical Applebee's restaurant.  The food is the same as all the other Applebee's that I have been to.  We were travelling from Northern MN to Southern Iowa for my nephew's HS graduation. The waitress was very kind and attentative.  She engaged us in conversation, as she wasn't very busy, I was a little disturbed that she didn't have a clue where Lake Superior was when I mentioned that we lived close to it.  She was in her mid-20s and didn't know about the largest lake in North America...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
1,Delena C.,"Grain Valley, MO",58,20,14.0,2.0,2017-05-17,"Food was great. Waitress was very friendly. Only thing that turned us off lastnight and we won't be back was $1 off Long Island ice tea. Sign across from us said $2.99 or $3.99, dependent on size. We were like right on! Get bill and they are $6.99 each. Response was oh that is different, that's for Top Shelf. Like we were supposed to know that??? Very misleading!! Ruined the experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pella-2,,,,,
