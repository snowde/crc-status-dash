13,Emily H.,"Glendale, AZ",118,2,,5.0,2016-07-26,"Great food. Randy and Tammy are the best servers ever, I'd ask for them for an even better experience but all around a great restaurant regardless. Friendly staff, always clean :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
11,Aaron M.,"Peoria, AZ",6,22,6.0,1.0,2016-08-06,"So myself and my girl just left applebees and the experience started off rocky by having 0 clean tables than making us wait  1 1/2 hours for APPETIZERS alone and then the boneless wings were cold and my spinach artichoke dip was setteled and crusted over you know ? Cause it has cheese in it, the service was terrible had no refills the entire time i was there while the table full of dudes got all her attention, and when the food finally was brought out my ""medium"" steak was burnt my girls ""medium"" burger was well done at this point i was furious and handled it in a manor that wasnt correct but i just felt literally disrespected so i walked out. The manager caught me outside and was wondering if i paid for my meal i told him that i couldnt and explained my reasoning he said i shoulda came to him and i agreed but i didnt want to over react on him so i removed the myself, anyway he didnt apologize after hearin my explaination and offered nothin to try and get my business back... a customer is 90% more likely to stay loyal if there problem is fixed than the customer that never had one. Will never be back... TILL I DIE lol jk but for real never goin back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
8,Kirk W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,8,,1.0,2016-09-11,Applebee's has lost their way! We had dinner there last night...What a huge disappointment ! The service was awful... My hamburger was ordered pink it was gray! They forgot my daughters salad... They made a reference to my mother in laws bake potato they were going to serve her was rotten so it would be a few minutes to bring a fresh one.  Please avoid this Applebee's at all cost  I will Never return there again and warn everyone I know to do the same.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
9,Joel B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,15,2.0,1.0,2016-09-30,Walked in just now put our name in for 4. We waited by the hostess podium and my father-in-law looked up and there is a cockroach the size of a pocket knife crawling on the ceiling. Do not eat here unless you ask if they have taken care of their bug problem.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
3,Kyle B.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,2016-12-30,"Always try to give this place a chance once a year and EVERYTIME we are completely let down! Total disappointment.  Food is always bad and never looks like the menu. This is the last time we will be at Applebee's.  OH AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE ""RIBLETS"" why would you get rid of the ONE thing that put you on the map.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
7,Tiffany A.,"Peoria, AZ",0,6,3.0,1.0,2017-01-04,NASTY! The appetizers were cold and we took one bite of out entrées and couldn't eat anymore. My chicken was burnt so bad it was black and hard to cut and DRAMATICALLY over seasoned. While my potatoes weren't cooked enough and had ZERO seasoning. We were to nice and didn't speak up about the terrible food but my stomach is still sour as I write this! BARF!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
4,Christal B.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,44,70.0,5.0,2017-01-22,"I only come here for the Mac N Cheese  food is good, but nothing in the world tastes like this macaroni. One time I had a burger, it was great, but I got mac n cheese to go. Never come here without ordering the macaroni & cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
12,Dale H.,"Glendale, AZ",7,23,,5.0,2017-01-27,"I have gone to this Applebees 4 or 5 times before.  Today I met two old classmates of mine that I have not seen in 30 some years.  (Keep in mind all 3 of us are retired and over 70 yrs old). We were promptly seated and within minutes a waitress took our order. Just then a group of 16 came in next to us, and the other tables began to fill up.  Within 20 minutes we received our orders, everything was hot, perfectly prepared and seasoned.  Our plates were cleared off  and the check was at our table within a reasonable length of time,  The 3 of us had a good long conservation and a wonderful dining experience.  I highly recommend this Applebee location to anyone that wants an enjoyable dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
1,Gina B.,"Glendale, AZ",34,234,167.0,2.0,2017-03-16,"So I haven't been to this location in quite awhile. We were seated quickly, it was semi busy. My son had the boneless wings and a side of fries. He didn't like them at all. Said the wings lacked serious flavor. He even asked for wing sauce that came so seriously thick it grossed him out... My boy is 12. I had the grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. It really lacked flavor, my chicken was a little tough and the broccoli was not steamed enough, they were still hard. My waitress was nice... I'm up in the air of coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
6,Sharon A.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,4,1.0,5.0,2017-05-13,"My friend and I decided Applebee's would be the place for lunch.  Been a lot of places to eat in my life, but the manager ""Benjamin"" at the restaurant impressed me.  Most places when you say you would like to move, because the area where you are sitting is to cold.  Back to your vehicle to get a sweater or  you move to another section.  No, he told us to stay where we were and in about 3mins we would feel a difference.  Not only did he do that, but he came back later and sat with us for a few moments to see if we were okay.  Job well done Sir.  Liked that waiter let us know that they were a little busy, it would be just a little bit for the food, but it didn't really take that long.  When we did received our food,  it was hot and delicious.  I would definitely go back to this particular Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
10,Jolene P.,"Peoria, AZ",0,4,,1.0,2017-07-01,"Unfortunately, we had an very bad experience tonight. We had to ask for drink refills several times. I had to ask for my salad before my dinner and when she brought it out it was smaller than a fast food side salad. The salmon was so dry and over cooked.  They didn't bring any butter for the potato. They brought two of the three meals out and we waited five minutes before they brought the other. The manager really didn't seem like he cared. While they did take the salmon off of the bill the waitress didn't say anything to us about it. She dropped the bill off and couldn't wait for us to leave. We have eaten there many times and have been very satisfied with the food and the staff, but not this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
5,William J.,"Chandler, AZ",14,6,2.0,2.0,2017-07-04,"Fair. Burger was over done and they were out of pickles. Wait time was short, food was ok at best. Server was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
2,Kandess C.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,29,50.0,1.0,2017-07-08,"The overall atmosphere was awesome, everyone was laid back and kind. The waitress we had was good to get our drinks and our order, after that, she came by once. I got salmon with mashed potatoes and shrimp with a side of spinach and broccoli. The ONLY good tasting thing on my entire plate was the broccoli.... the salmon was tough and dry. The mashed potatoes looked amazing but sadly tasted like stale water with a touch of salt. I was pretty disappointed with my food. It's the first time I haven't liked their food. After, we asked the waitress for a dessert menu, she tried just telling us what there was but we wanted to look at our options and take our time. When she was done telling us our options we still asked for a menu to which we got a huge eye roll! She avoided us after that and never came back. I probably won't be visiting this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
0,Dylan H.,"Peoria, AZ",32,15,1.0,5.0,2017-10-23,"Dan the man! I usually watch football on Sundays and Mondays. Always sit at the bar, Dan the bartender is always on top of it. Super friendly, always hustling, and you can't beat the happy hour prices. Half off domestics/half off appetizers. This is definitely my spot for Sunday/Monday night games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-peoria-6,,,,,
