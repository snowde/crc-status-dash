30,Luis Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,22,,2.0,2012-02-06,"I always considered Applebees as an average place. The food is ho-hum nothing special. At times i wonder how long has that food been sitting there. I believe a lot of food is pre-cooked earlier that day, then microwaved and served. I think the Burgers are cooked fresh though. Just fyi, to any of the previous posters or whomever reads this review. This Applebees on Castor is the training/eval center. I havent really had a problem with the actual service here. Its just the food isnt the best. This goes for all Applebees although im sure some are better than others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

21,Eboni F.,"Philadelphia, PA",139,283,384.0,2.0,2012-08-23,"Same ol, Same ol. The food was food. The bacon cheddar burger came out cooked great but the fries were salty as hell! The waitress suggested a drink the yummi gummy martini and it was entirely too sweet. And I much as I am a fan of good customer service, she was obnoxious. Sorry, but I don't like to be hovered over or interrupted every 5 minutes. She insisted that my guest go online to rate the restaurant as we were seated and was a little too pushy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
24,Jamal J.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,105,14.0,2.0,2012-09-16,The food came out on time. It didn't look fresh and the salad had way top much dressing. I was embarrassed I brought my family here.

She was funny, hospitable, and charming. And she didn't make fun of us for splitting a bill 4 ways. I would have spit on us.

25,Rancis R.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,14,7.0,2.0,2013-04-15,"This place is really 50/50, its either good or its bad. I've had times where my waitress never came to check up on my table, times where my waitress made me lose my appetite and other times where there are no complaints. Really taking a chance with this location, but luckily there are other good restaurants around :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20,,,,,

17,Bill M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,12,,2.0,2014-08-24,There is certainly a difference between going inside and carside To Go. If you head there will low expectations then you'll be fine.  i've had 3 bad experiences ordering from carside. usually I pull up and wait 5 to 10 minutes for someone to come out to the car to acknowledge me.  One time I actually went inside I waited so long. The food is inconsistent. I've had very good food and on the same menu item overcooked or soggy veggies.  It is good that they align with Weight Watchers points and have some diet-friendly items to choose from. But that is no different from the national chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,,,,,
20,Christina M.,"Philadelphia, PA",134,83,35.0,2.0,2014-12-12,Service lousy! The food is typical Applebee's! I been here several times & my food has come out cold. No lie cold!! If you love Applebee's food the one in Fishtown is a mile away from this one. The service here comes with no smile & a lot of eye rolling at customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20,,,,,

13,Letitia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-04-04,"I'd say this place gave me the worst service ever, but if be lying because I actually didn't get served at all. 25 minutes sitting at a table in a half empty restaurant at 8pm on a Monday and I got nothing. Not a hello, a drink, acknowledgment... A manager walked by and a server from another section about six times and not a peep... My boyfriend and I eventually left our complaints with the hostess and walked out... Took a ride to the cherry hill location and was seated, ate and paid in 40 minutes. I will never go back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,,,,,
10,RevRun R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,2016-09-23,"Visited this Applebee's with my wife all set to order our usual order of spinach and artichoke dip, double crunched wings, with a side of chicken breast and white rice, when we were greeted by the unpleasant and arrogant manager, Amante Nuualiitia. He says ""every other Applebee's has it wrong and he has it right."" You can't order that. Even after telling him that we order the same thing at Applebee's all over the east coast and that the menu says opposite, he shrugged his shoulders. Then I asked for the general manager's name and he said ""it's on the side of the building."" Needless to say ""we won't be back here.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,,,,,

8,Jackie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,15,17.0,1.0,2017-01-26,Sitting here as we speak. Seated fairly quickly. Took the waitress over 10 minutes to come greet us another 10 before she came back to take our order. My pasta tasted like water and my husbands chicken was burnt. She came about 15 minutes after the food came out to refill our drinks and we waited almost 20 minutes before she even came for the check. Beyond ridiculous. Felt bad for the table behind us because she spilled their drinks on their laps. Beyond horrible service. 10 minutes later and we're still waiting for her to bring back our credit card.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
4,Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,62,90.0,2.0,2017-02-19,"I went today to enjoy a nice dinner with my significant other. First off, the servers looked like they hated being there. At least one of the servers which I recall, Megan, gave better service than those who came with our food and served it to our table with a bitter face and left our table. The appetizers came out at different times and so we waited until all our appetizers came out so we can chow down without feeling bad for each other. My entree was a 6oz steak with mashed potatoes and garlicky green beans. It was overall good except the green beans were bland and somewhat watery. My boyfriend got an 8oz steak with mashed potatoes and fries. It looked as if they gave him a 6oz steak and a leftover piece of steak they had from a previous order because it was burnt as hell and so he did not finish it at all. Then the check came and it seems as if our server put in our order wrong just by a mere dollar but we let it slide and paid for it to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

2,Isabella L.,"Burlington, VT",190,99,20.0,4.0,2017-06-29,"I love this apples bees! I have noticed that they seem to be more on top of there game when it is during the evening (thing end of dinner and after dinner crowd) and things are packed, than during the day when things are slower. Not sure why that is, but its true. The staff here is friendly, and love to make conversation with you. The food is up to applebee's standard and the bar is always packed out. I have yet to have an unpleasant experience here, and we've been eating here over the course of four years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
1,Vona W.,"Chambersburg, Trenton, NJ",8,22,23.0,4.0,2017-07-20,"First of all, our waiter, Kel, he's the best waiter we've ever had. He is everything you would want in a waiter - friendly, nice, attentive, well informed, funny and laid back. We will go back just because of him! He's amazing! The food was good, filled with flavor and a good portion.  I would had gave 5 stars based off of that. But when we first walked in, the girl seating people didn't say anything. She proceeded to seat us in the bar area, which was loud and we kindly asked her if we could be seated away from the music and the bar. She gave an attitude and walked towards the stand, we walked a little further than her and she was like, ""where are you going!?"".. I kindly thanked her for seating us elsewhere and she just walked away with an attitude. If you have mostly empty seating on the other side (the quiet side) why would you try to seat us in the noisy bar side? Anyway, when we were waiting for our food she would walk past seating others and giving us dirty looks. Seriously, I wish I would have gotten her name but she is extremely unprofessional and very rude. Kel saved this particular restaurant from receiving 1 star from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

Food is decent, and they're usually pretty quick when I come on my lunch break and sit at the bar. Only complaint would be off-putting bar tenders.
