I placed my order with a server who didn't know anything about the menu or lunch specials. I was told my order would be ready at 1:30 and asked what type of vehicle I drive. Pulled up in the car side spot around 1:40 and continued to sit in my car and wait another 8 minutes. Finally walked in the side door to a server who was standing there talking on the phone. He acknowledged me while still on the phone and I told him I was picking up an order to go. He looked at a few tickets and didn't bother to check the bag that was sitting right in front of him, said it would be a few minutes and then moved to another station to get on a personal phone call. Waiting another couple of minutes another server came out bringing drinks and asked what I needed. Finally he was able to get me my food that was sitting at the station the whole time. I let him know I was out there waiting 10 minutes and that there was another car there waiting too. This is just ridiculous whats the point of car side.

I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's.  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years, and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for us. So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories. We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left. Yes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse, he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guy. BUT OMG!!!

56,Alexis B.,"Sun City, AZ",0,2,,1.0,2013-11-05,"Applebees is a restaurant that serves American style food, such as burgers and salads and soups.  The food is mediocre and not the highest quality that I have ever had.  I went out to dinner with two friends before a movie we were going to see.  We had arrived an hour and a half earlier then the movie would start ensuring we would have enough time to eat and make it to the movie on time.  We were seated in a decent amount of time.  The server took about 20 minutes to come over to take our drink orders.  Once we had ordered, she came back 30 minutes later with our drinks.  At this point we were a little frustrated with the service.  We asked if we could order right away because we had a movie to get to and she was aware of this.  She took our order and said it would be out shortly.  We waited for 40 minutes before we started to get impatient.  After about 55 minutes we grabbed another waitress, since ours was no where to be found and asked her what was taking so long.  She said she would go check on our food for us and came back to inform us that our order had not even been placed.  We were furious.  I immediately went and complained to the manager about how horrible the service we had received was and how our waitress had taken over an hour and had not even placed our order.  The manager apologized profusely and said that she would get our meals out right away and that they would be on the house.  We were so angry and disappointed in the service and once our food was finally brought out we were continually disappointed by the low quality of the food.  Once we had finally left the movie had already started and we were forced to wait until the next showing of the movie.  Ever since that experience at Applebees,  I have not been back to the establishment and will never recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again.

20,Abmti A.,"Glendale, AZ",11,2,2.0,2.0,2016-02-01,"To say the quality of this restaurant has gone down would be a serious understatement. We went for lunch. We ordered the unlimited soup, salad, and bread for $9.99. The salad was ok. I guess that is hard to mess up. The soup was not soup. It was the consistency of tomato paste. It glooped off of my spoon. When I asked for another, the waitress said ""well it's the same soup, so..."" And then just kinda shrugged like I was the problem. Then I asked for our bread which we didn't receive. She said ""we don't do that anymore. If you want bread it's a dollar extra."" I explained that it was on the menu. She said ""well, it shouldn't be."" Real nice. My advice, go to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=20,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
28,Rick B.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,3,,1.0,2016-02-11,"I left a pair of my sunglasses on the table because I was gathering all of my 5 month olds stuff up. I understand it was my fault I didn't pay much attention and I had to call back later to ask for them back. (The only people that would have touched the table after I left would be the waitress picking up her tip or the busser cleaning the table up). The manager Kenny then told me that they weren't there. I work in customer service too and people leave things in my store all the time and come back looking for them, we on the other hand actually give the items back instead of letting our employees keep them. Sure, I left them on the table but I didn't think that makes them fair game for the employees to keep!!!!!   I called twice and ""Kenny"" was not helpful at all. He let me know when I asked for corporates phone # that he didn't think they would do anything for me then spit the # at me as fast as he could then hung up. I will definitely be calling.

We sat at the bar and watched the 3 couples ahead of us get seated and then 2 that came in after us. All the while there was 3 dirty tables in the bar. Asked the hostess if someone could clean one of them and she said  no, they were for people waiting. The bartender Monica was super sweet and helpful and got the manager. He had a table cleaned for us and the hostess put someone at it. Fine we took the next table. It took our server 10 minutes to get to us and while waiting for our food my bf noticed something floating in my drink. GROSS... Then when we got our food our server didn't give us any silverware or napkins. THANK GOODNESS for Monica. Again she came to the rescue. I wish I could remember the managers name.

I told my waitress, she just apologized and said she was going to tell the manager. The manager did not come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were going to take care of it and thank you for letting them know.

26,Ashley M.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,5,3.0,2.0,2016-07-09,"It was a busy night. Therefore it is obvious that service and food may take a little longer than usual.   I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
9,Brian J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,98,158.0,5.0,2016-07-17,"We had a wonderful experience with this place! We've eaten at Applebees in the past and have never been let down; however, up until now, we had always dined at the restaurant. This time, we decided to try something new so we placed our order online. As you can imagine, ordering online turned out to be a very simple process. We got to pick specifically what we wanted with each meal and appetizer. For example, I ordered a burger so I got to specify how I wanted it cooked, what toppings (including sauces and type of cheese), and I even got to specify that I wanted my fries seasoned with garlic. We then set the time for when we wanted the food to be ready. At the specified time, we drove to the restaurant and parked in the space designated for car-side pick-up. Within minutes, a very polite gentleman approached us and asked to confirm our order. Soon afterwards, he brought us our food, which smelled absolutely wonderful on the ride home. The food was terrific. My burger was just fantastic. It was made exactly as I had ordered. My wife had the chicken tenders (which I sampled) and those were awesome too. We also got the boneless barbecue wings, which also rocked.  I can't wait to have Applebees again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

6,Chef J.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,11,1.0,1.0,2017-03-02,"Should be a -5 (minus) star. A complete waste of money. Never, ever, have I seen such a disgraceful presentation of a 1/2 rack of ribs in my frikin entire life. You should be ashamed of putting that on a plate to serve to a customer. I feed my Toy Chihuahua bigger portions. Looking at the size of the ribs were compared to what my dogs ribs looked like. Funny my dogs ribs had more meat.  Mr District Manager, you need to check whats going out on the plates. If you sitdown and order this meal, you would be just as disappointed as my wife and I were. Both of us being in the restaurant business for a total of 80 years combined, cooking and managerial,  we know if you wouldn't eat it, don't serve it. Your people need to take ownership and speak up when they see something wrong. I just cant believe this was allowed to be served. It looks like it was boiled all night and then re-heated in microwave. It was as tough as jerky. Shame, shame, shame on you. The funny thing about this ordeal is that I made the mistake. I was supposed to go to Chili's for the ribs which looked good on tv, and I mixed up the names and went to you guys.

The family should have been asked to leave, but instead it looks like they got their meal comped or taken care of... which is probably what they wanted. The manager should GROW SOME and back his employees, especially when they are being threatened.
