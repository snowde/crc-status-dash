8,S. E.,"Pendleton, IN",0,7,,3.0,2013-03-04,"Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was clean.  Sadly, our server messed-up our order, even though we were only one of 4 tables in the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
6,Ashlee B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,10,3.0,4.0,2014-07-14,"It's an Applebee's, I honestly don't expect much.  This review is for the two times I went here while visiting family and both times they went above my expectations.  First time was a Saturday night with a table of 7.  We were seated in a timely fashion as soon as the hostesses pushed two tables together.  Our waitress was nice, our food was fast and correct, and everything tasted good.  Second time we went we had 6 people including a person in a wheelchair.  We got there pretty late and asked the hostess for a specific table (it was the most accessible for our friend in the wheelchair) and she replied ""there isn't a server over there"" in somewhat of a snarky tone.. Explained our situation, she went and (I assume) spoke with a manager and then silently walk us to the table we asked for.   Our server (who I think may be a manager, and if not she should be) was awesome.  I was in a kind of a bad mood since it had been such a long day and we were uber late meeting our friends.  She was calm, professional, and very helpful.  Drinks were kept full, questions were answered, and food was correct when it arrived.  If you don't know what Applebee's food is like... It isn't gourmet and a lot of it is pre made/ pre cooked.  It's pretty much a glorified McDonald's. Both nights I chose off the ""Have it All"" menu ( less than 550 calories menu): 1st night I had the Cedar Salmon which was decent but a little dry (better than i expected) so I just added a little lemon to the fish and I was good to go.  The veggies were good, just needed a little salt, and decently portioned. The 2nd night I had the Lemon Parm Shrimp which again was decent (you can tell it's precooked/packaged) and needed a little salt.  I would order both again.  We also had the spinach dip- good, the mozz sticks- your basic cheese stick, hot, gooey, and they give you a ton of them, and hot boneless wings- pretty good but not spicy enough (the 2nd time after mentioning the wings weren't hot the previous time she offered to do them extra spicy, and they were a little hotter).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
0,Matt B.,"Irvine, CA",77,49,21.0,3.0,2014-10-21,My first time to an Applebee's. I was disappointed to find there were neither apples nor bees present. Both may have made my night more enjoyable. Or not. You decide.  Just stopping thru. It seems like a decent joint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
4,Jami M.,"Argos, IN",1,3,,1.0,2014-11-21,We were told a 5-10 min wait. Somehow the host was confused and seated 3 couples before us 25 min later. We ordered a couple drinks from the bar. I ordered a frozen margarita. It came on the rocks and the waitress knowingly brought it over to see if I would take it. Which I did... Awesome service. Not. We decided to eat at the movie theatre bc we figured we would get better service. Lmao. Next time we will just go to Christos.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
5,Kevin G.,"Plymouth, IN",0,27,,1.0,2016-06-25,"Recently dined there earlier this week when our power was out due to a storm.  I hadn't been in Applebee's for quite a while and after this visit this time I fully realized why!!  Upon our entry the waitress was busy talking with customer at the entry and wasn't tuned in to much of anything.  She asked us if we wanted a booth or table and we asked for a booth.  The place wasn't busy, but it took her a while to get us seated.  Once seated we realized the air conditioning vent was blowing down on us, but we didn't ask to be reseated.  Once seated we waited a while for our waitress to come back to take our order.  Luckily they had trivia at the table to keep us occupied.  We ordered the 2 for $20 deal (don't be fooled more like 2 for $40 with drinks and tips).  We ordered the mozzarella sticks that came with the deal for an appetizer.  Our waitress brought the plates and realized one was dirty so she took them back.  Then we had another wait and we were wondering if she had to wash the dishes??  Finally received the appetizer with clean plates which was fine.  Then came the wait for the crunchy shrimp and fries which we both ordered.  The waitress asked us if we wanted cocktail sauce or ketchup and we asked for both.  Once the entree's made it to the table via other employees, there was no ketchup (which didn't matter as the fries were ice cold and we didn't eat them).  We did wave down the hostess (who was nice) much better than the waitress, and accomodated us with the ketchup before realizing our fries were cold, while we noticed again our waitress was at another table chatting.  I understand she needs to be nice, but I would have liked her to be a little more attentive and a little less chatty!  All in all the food was average, the service poor, and the price for what we got left us wishing we had went elsewhere.  Have a feeling this evening out soured us for good on Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
3,Tim N.,"Gatlinburg, TN",15,5,,1.0,2016-10-15,"My wife didn't care for the bug salad but was even more offended by being told it wasn't a bug as the salad was whisked away. My wife had ordered a salad without bacon. She was enjoying her salad when she noticed a small black dot on a leaf. Upon further investigation we had identified the dot with legs as a small bug. A gnat or tiny ant. A small bug but still NOT SALAD. So I promptly notified our waitress who was working closely with the manager. The manager took the leaf and whisked it away. Then came back a minute later and told us that it wasn't a bug but she (the manager) was sorry and would comp the dish. WOW! Thanks lady! She comped the whole $2.99 salad, but offered another one to replace it to! It wasn't so much the bug, or the ""comp"", but the way she lied. Implying, basically, that we were either lieing or to incompetent to identify a bug. I mean it was a salad, and tiny bugs exist. So it doesn't freak us out, especially when you consider how many bugs we probably eat without knowing it. But don't insult me with a bold faced lie and act like you did us a favor with a $2.99 comp. My bill was still $44 and some change. Night shift 10/15/2016 if anyone cares to find out who the manager was. It'll be a while before I give this place a shot again. Thanks for the comp though. I should note that the waitress was good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,

1,Beth M.,"Mishawaka, IN",0,6,,2.0,2017-10-31,"Visited this location Sunday night, to find another couple in front of us, waiting to be seated. The host took a good bit of time cleaning off a table (despite several open tables) and then disappeared completely. Meanwhile, several servers and a manager delivered food to a table of 5 near the front door, and not one greeted us. Another party of three came in. We all waited. The manager eventually came up and explained that they'd seat us shortly. His explanation of the delay was that several large parties just left and he was letting the kitchen catch up. I do not accept this because 1) The large party is no longer in site. They must have eaten quite some time ago. What does the kitchen have to ""catch up"" on? 2) Seating people, getting them started with a drink does not tax the beleaguered kitchen. Keeping us standing by the crowded doorway only makes us unhappy. Upon receiving our appetizer, we were offered no plates. The music was overwhelmingly loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plymouth-6,,,,,
