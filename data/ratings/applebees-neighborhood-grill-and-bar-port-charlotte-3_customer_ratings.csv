16,Sal G.,"Miami, United States",215,810,80.0,1.0,2013-01-08,"What can you hope for at 11pm? Apparently not very much. We arrived into town rather late by local standards and so only had one close option for dinner. I hadn't been to an Applebee's since 2004 so figured that it had to have changed. While it had changed, it wasn't for the better. We decided to split the following items: Black and Bleu Burger (medium) minus mushrooms with Fried Boneless Buffalo Wings (hot) Everything tasted sugary sweet. The amount of sweetness was sickening and unbalanced. I pushed myself to eat my half of the burger and ate 3/4 of the wings since my friend refused to eat more than 1/4. It may take longer than eight years for me to forget this experience before I go back to another Applebee's.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
22,Reviewer M.,"Clearwater, United States",0,21,1.0,4.0,2013-02-07,"I did not even recognize this Applebee's from the reviews. Lovely professional staff and piping hot good food, not expensive, and served promptly, characteristic of the best (examples of) Applebee's I have been to. We like the chain,and this was not atypical. Exceptionally nice and helpful staff and manager. We were en route from Sanibel to St Pete and it was a lovely experience, glad we stopped.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3?start=20,,,,,

11,Danielle D.,"Bradenton, United States",131,411,96.0,1.0,2014-01-07,"I can see why this Applebee's only has 2 stars.  Food was ok...typical Applebees quality.  I had the classic boneless buffalo wings and they can come out hot and properly sauced (after having to send back the honey bbq wings they first brought out)  However, the service was TERRIBLE.  When paying, the waiter went to bring me back my debit card and it wasn't there.  He didn't know where he left it and he visited others tables and waited on them before even looking for my card and getting it back to me.  I felt extremely uncomfortable and spoke to management about it.  I wish I could remember his name, because he really needs to go.  Terrible location....ruins the reputation of other locations.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
20,Jess B.,"Punta Gorda, United States",1,55,,3.0,2014-06-04,"This Applebee's is quieter than the one in Murdock so if you want talk to family and have them hear you, you might want to bring them to this one. I would avoid late Winter/Spring season because flying ants infest the place. You will be covered in flying ants sitting in the window booths. Gross!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3?start=20,,,,,
17,Patricia W.,"Punta Gorda, United States",7,169,269.0,3.0,2014-07-10,Food pretty good.  Needs more efficiency for service. Lots of staff but don't work together.  Have been here half dozen times and it is still the same.  Chain setting.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
19,Jonathan F.,"Bonney Lake, United States",31,60,18.0,4.0,2014-09-30,"Good food, good service, good looking waitresses. But I could hear the the kitchen from the dining area.

13,Melody L.,"Port Charlotte, United States",5,31,1.0,5.0,2014-10-19,"Just moved to the neighborhood and love how close this Applebee's is to me. Our server Marie was super friendly, knowledgable, and made us feel comfortable. We decided to come here to watch football and they have every game on the TVs. We got one of their IPA craft beers which were cold, light, and smooth  and a 2 for 1 promotion was going on as well. Overall I had a great experience and we will be returning.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
9,Marc P.,"Ruskin, United States",14,29,10.0,2.0,2015-01-26,Slow. Slow. Slow. We sat at the bar and Drew waited on us. Slow as molasses. 20 minutes to take our order. Won't go back there.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
12,Lester P.,"Traverse City, United States",2,7,4.0,4.0,2015-02-13,"A busy Friday night at Applebee's.  Chain quality and consistency.  We had appetizer, salads and drinks.  A good waitress and good food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
18,C B.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,28,5.0,1.0,2015-02-15,Terrible service combined with cold food and a manager that could care less about the happiness of her clientele. Where else does your appetizer show up with no plate at the same time your fajitas arrive with no tortillas. If I could rate 0 out of 5 I would. Will never come back.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
7,Tundra D.,"Dacula, United States",8,71,12.0,2.0,2015-02-28,"Ugh, I think I'm becoming a food snob. Im so over eating at places like this that don't cook their food fresh to order. I could get the same quality in the frozen section at the grocery store and heat it up in the oven or microwave myself.  Kobe ""style"" meatballs??? WTF is Kobe ""style""? I love how restaurants word things.  Me: are these Kobe beef? (I knew they weren't because 3 meatballs that size of Kobe would be $15+) Waiter: they are Kobe style Me: what does that mean, so they aren't Kobe beef? Waiter: I don't know Later, to his credit, he came back an informed me they definitely aren't Kobe beef. I told him I already knew that and I explained to him where Kobe beef comes from, pricing of Kobe, and the process of how they treat the animal. I don't think he was impressed or believed me for that matter.  Ok so I ordered the Kobe ""style"" meatballs(Shoooosh! Don't say it!), ordered the wontons, and half a rack of ribs with fries and onion rings. Kobe ""style"" meatballs are bland pieces of God knows what meat smothered in red sauce and cheese. Don't let the Kobe word fool you, these ain't your grandmas meatballs. I ate 1... Wontons were below par of what a crappy Chinese restaurant would serve. Key word there is crappy... Ribs were your typical overcooked, fall off the bone, smothered in sauce....goodness. Not great, not good, but I'll take it over the rest of the menu. I should know better than to order ribs at this place rather than a true BBQ place, but it was 1 am and the menu is blah! They get a 1/2 star for bar ribs being edible.  I should've went with the fajitas, but hindsight is 20/20.  Onion rings were over battered and overcooked, yep...typical bar food I guess.  Fries were ok, nothing special. Just fries.  The server did a good job, he gets 1 1/2 stars for that. It isn't his fault the food sucks where he works.  Where should I eat tomorrow???",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
15,Kayla G.,"Arcadia, United States",28,6,,1.0,2015-07-01,"The place is clean and the servers seemed nice enough, although not checking in with us nearly often enough. My husband and I went with 2 kids ages 2 and 7. We were never offered a booster seat or crayons to keep the kids occupied while we waited ridiculously long for our appetizer, then the childrens' plates came out almost a full 10 minutes before the adults' entrees of simple fish and chips. We won't be coming back anytime soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
10,Jennifer C.,"North Port, United States",0,12,,1.0,2015-12-27,"I have eaten at Applebee's many times but tonight the food was terrible!!!  To begin, I ordered the spinach artichoke dip: it was watery with very little artichoke and very little cheese- TERRIBLE, second the French Onion Soup was all soup and the cheese/bread topping was almost non existent, third: I ordered the brisket enchilada's. Only one of the three enchilada's had any meat in it. Over-all : The waitress Jennifer T. was FANTASTIC and right there for us, she kept a smile even though I told her how bad the food was. She suggested she would speak with the kitchen.  My suggestion: promote Jennifer T. and demote the chef ASAP , before you lose your customers for ever!!!  Where the heck is the Manager???  After reading many of the reviews, I am not alone in this issue.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,

6,Tammy S.,"North Port, United States",1,15,,1.0,2016-09-06,I order lunch often with my coworkers and this my second visit with issues. Thanks for throwing my fried in a bag and handing them to me soaking wet. My burger was pink when i asked for no pink. There was no lettuce tomato or any other condiments. They always forget our stuff... i am over it and Applebee's you lost not just one but 5 customers... get your stuff together,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,

5,Ryan S.,"Punta Gorda, United States",26,7,4.0,5.0,2016-11-10,"Bartender Jessica and the rest of the staff are good people. I come here often because it's in deep creek. Some old Dbag was just complaining and making a scene because his game wasn't on the tv yet. So I thought I'd cancel out his negative ""I'm gonna call corporate"" attitude with my stellar 5 star review. Jessica you're awesome. Someone give this bartender a BONU$$$.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
0,Carter B.,"Nashville, United States",11,145,16.0,4.0,2017-01-15,"I stayed across the street and arrived tired and late. I went over to Applebee's for dinner about 8 PM and saw that the place was full. The bar was full, but there were a few tables and I was seated immediately. My waitress was right there and soon had a Manhattan sitting in front of me. It was good, though I still think Applebee's should put bitters in their Manhattans. Various bartenders have given me differing reasons, but... I ordered the Shrimp Wonton (580 calories as I've decided to sleek up a bit) and it was there quickly. It was good and filling. Even though it was a little spicy for me, I would order it again as I enjoyed the flavor. The on-table device which allows you to pay your check is a good idea. I have seen it elsewhere, but I like it for its convenience. It's also good for mathphobes as it will calculate a tip to your desired percentage.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
3,Jim F.,"Johnstown, United States",1,92,52.0,1.0,2017-01-15,I just love when a local yocal can't take a constructive criticism about their favorite bar tender.

2,Tobin h.,"Elmhurst, United States",101,769,5.0,4.0,2017-01-24,"Just to start...Michelle was one of the best servers ever. She had a work ethic and hustle about her that inspired a loud, clear order from my young daughters. The kind of server that worked so hard that when I dropped my straw wrapper, picking it up was an easy decision...she didn't have to work any harder than she already was. Now that the love fest with Michelle is over, great managed staff that worked in tune with each other and were diligent in their tasks. Applebee's food is pretty good for a chain and this particular location had it going on! Worth the I-75 pit stop in or out of the Florida travels.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-charlotte-3,,,,,
1,Paul K.,"North Port, United States",0,11,,2.0,2017-05-12,"The food was decent but the service was extremely lacking. Our waitress disappeared, had to walk up to the bar to get a soda refill. Ordered a drink and it was incorrect, tried to send it back only to be told we were wrong, the drink was correct. Finally ended up asking to have it removed from our bill.

We were the first ones in, and the table was still firty from the night before - crumbs and food everywhere, and even a hair! The manager admitted that they leave everything for whoever comes in the next day, and they just didnt get around to wiping our table. I dont even want to imagine what the kitchen is like!
