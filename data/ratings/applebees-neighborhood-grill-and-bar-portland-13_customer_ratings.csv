5,Cristina R.,"Houston, TX",93,33,212.0,3.0,2016-06-07,"As an Applebee's it's an overall average. I had the cedar salmon with fire grilled veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon had that tasty grill flavor but lacked seasoning. Next time I'll ask for lime! The veggies fell way short. Some were nicely grilled and others were completely hard like they've never been cooked. Add on the fact they had no seasoning at all. No salt or pepper even. The potatoes were a solid side. These are consistent no matter what Applebee's you go to. I love them. For dessert I had the brownie bite as It was just me. Nice big scoop of ice cream and the brownie was warm. Yum!! Hit the spot after a long Monday.  The ambience is chill. The building looks new. Pretty modernized. The staff is southern sweet. As a solo diner they kept me company, sat with me, talked to me. So welcoming! As a solo traveler this was much appreciated and so hard to find in some of the bigger cities. Will come back and maybe get a different entree...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
9,Norm B.,"Kapolei, HI",10,166,125.0,3.0,2016-06-17,This one is worth a visit but bring your appetite and/or a desire to drink. It has a sports bar atmosphere that includes plenty of noise from the bar and various monitors. The menu is large. The selections were outstanding and satisfying. Great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
10,Chad A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,13,1.0,1.0,2016-07-27,"This is the slowest service Applebee's I have ever been to. It took 10 mins to get the attention of a waitress to order a drink, which was to the top with ice and 15% of an actual drink. The place was about 50% filled and it took over 40 mins to get a burger and a steak. No apologies from the server. She was too busy at the bigger table to pay any attention to our little 2 person table.  Stay away. Go next door to IHOP or Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
13,Frank F.,"Ingleside, TX",9,4,,2.0,2016-08-27,"Food and service good but music was ear splitting loud. We requested it turned down and our server did so, but it was turned up minutes later. We couldn't wait to get out of there.....will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
11,Marlani H.,"Pleasanton, TX",1,37,8.0,4.0,2016-10-19,"We were seated after a few minutes of getting there.  Fabulous service.  I never even had to ask for tea refills.  Food was good.  Will definitely go there again and will recommend it!  Don't really like all the tvs hanging around the restaurant but guess that's what you get at a Sports Bar.  It wasn't too loud. I could still here what my husband was saying to me!! I ordered the brewsky chicken with stout gravy, mashed potatoes.  It was amazing!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
12,Haratico H.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,4,,3.0,2016-12-20,"It is applebees. Nuff said   standards are crazy high , and they aren't complete crap.   If you are taking your significant other on a date to applebees,  think you need to REevaluate your life",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
4,Deez N.,"Houston, TX",0,18,7.0,1.0,2016-12-22,"To sum it up this Applebee's should pay me to eat their food. Yes its that horrible. Chips were fried in dirty grease and almost dark brown. Should have left then. Ordered a steak medium and it was not even rare. Sent it back to cook more. Came back still mooing. Save yourself somw grief, dont eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
7,Patrick M.,"Victoria, TX",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-14,I can not remember the last time I had such poor service. I don't know how good the food was because they forgot my order then didn't come back to check if everything was correct until everyone was almost finished eating. This Applebee's cured me from ever trying another one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
8,Debbie B.,"Calallen, TX",0,24,2.0,1.0,2017-08-05,"Should have checked the reviews first. ... Probably par for applebees.  Service pathetic, asked for more salsa twice, still waiting..... Never came.  Caught herself on my water refill when she came back and asked how we were doing, again.  Music way tooooo loud.  Food subpar.  I had honey chix cavatapi and hubby had firecracker shrimp cavatapi.   Wish we'd gone elsewhere ESPECIALLY for the price and lousy service and atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
6,Travis W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",28,11,,3.0,2017-09-01,"This is an okay place, but I have a lot more complaints here than I did for Chili's. What Applebee's does right is appetizers. On the other hand, their food is slightly overpriced and I've had several problems with service. It's usually not a terrible experience, but there's an overall better and very similar place a minute down the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
2,Ben J.,"Prague, OK",93,11,18.0,1.0,2017-09-23,Sat here for 30 mins at the bar. Worst experience ever. Took 20 mins for a beer. 10 mins to pay out and then the bartender decided to ask me if I wanted something to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
3,Merry E.,"Portland, TX",37,21,4.0,4.0,2017-10-17,I like their food ok we normally go for the drinks and appetizers though it normally has better service than chili's the waitstaff has always seemed to be nice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
0,Keith H.,"Rockport, TX",15,74,93.0,4.0,2017-10-22,"The food was fantastic. I had the Whiskey Bacon burger and it was great. We had a small snafu with the drink order but it was handled well. We ended up with a Blue Agave margarita instead of the summer breeze, both were delicious in the end. We also had one item that didn't get ordered (French onion soup) that was also handled well by the staff. This is probably the best French Onion soup I've had in a chain restaurant. My son loved the corn dog. My daughter had the four cheese Mac and cheese which I thought was very good, my daughter thought it was ok and my wife said it lacked ""color""? My daughter also had the chicken with beer cheese sauce and it was great. The chicken was tender and juicy. Lucas was a very attentive server and did a great job. I will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
1,Rusty M.,"Portland, TX",1,26,27.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"What a waste of $85.00 for 4 meals, service started good and quickly went down hill. When they tell you that you can substitute regular fries for sweet potato fries for a fee and you say ok , then they bring you regular fries . And you question it an goes ill go get the right fries but never does but your charged for them , then you order the endless ribs except they end after your second order because the waiter never comes back that sux, when you have to ask for flatware, napkins and try to get a refill of tea , you finish eating at 915 pm and you finally get to pay for your meal at 1000 pm , I wont come back i waited a year from the last time i had crappy service their and the foods no better than chilis where the service is better and thats not saying much, i hope their management reads these reviews because portland deserves better and im tired of wasting money on crappy service and sub par food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portland-13,,,,,
