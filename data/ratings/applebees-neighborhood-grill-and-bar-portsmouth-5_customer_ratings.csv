17,Stephanie V.,"York, ME",41,326,132.0,5.0,2012-12-10,"Love, love, love the grilled shrimp on spinach. The dressing is fantastic. The shrimp is perfectly cooked. My family loved their pasta and chicken dinners as well. The ""choose 3"" appetizers was great! Service was impeccable as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
14,Jeff G.,"Portsmouth, NH",0,1,,4.0,2013-12-29,We ate here on Thursday night.  The service was great. I loved the chicken tenders.  It's nice to see how many items they now have under 550 calories.  The chicken salad had a bit too much dressing but was tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
10,Amar P.,"Newport, RI",36,124,20.0,3.0,2014-10-19,"Good service. They made me something vegetarian, please add veggie options to your menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
12,Emily M.,"Corinth, VT",0,6,,5.0,2015-01-23,"I eat gluten free because I am sensitive to it and it's always a challenge eating in restaurants. Applebee's is one of those places that doesn't even have a designated GF menu, but if you know how to spot gluten, you can find a number of options that are virtually GF! I just ate here and had the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken with Quinoa off their new ""Pub Diet"" and it was amazing! I also had the Sweet Potato Fries as an appetizer, the Green Goddess Salad Wedge as a side, a Shirley Temple for a drink, and a full size Hot Fudge Sundae for dessert. BEST GF MEAL! Thank you Applebee's! Also, the people are really nice at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
0,Beck C.,"Portsmouth, NH",114,79,10.0,5.0,2015-01-23,"There are two main visitor types at Applebee's during lunch: children and the elderly.  It's hilarious. Great lunch today with my hubby and our youngest.  They really cater well to families.  They have these dessert shooters now which are PERFECT for little ones.  Instead of a giant two-pound slice of pie, you can get a shooter filled with a few bites of something sweet after lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
9,Melanie G.,"Lawrence, MA",0,2,,5.0,2015-03-29,"Love this Applebee's. was seated promptly, food was excellent, service was great, prices were reasonable, and the temperature was perfect. So I'm not sure how many people  notice the temperature in most restaurants? It is usually cold. not sure why I have to freeze threw a meal but not here which is a big deciding factor for me. Very family friendly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
4,Brie S.,"Somersworth, NH",13,5,2.0,1.0,2015-03-30,Waiter was inattentive and hovered as I tried to punch in my tip on our little computer thing.. I find that extremely unprofessional DO NOT COME HERE FOR LUNCH!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
13,Zoey D.,"Eliot, ME",0,4,,1.0,2015-09-06,Don't go to Applebee's to often. It is right around the corner and could be a great costumer and convenience. The sign says that you carry Amstel light. THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY!!!!!!! Don't advertise something that is not there. Also steak was over cooked and burned. No greetings when we came in. The waitress over used the term sorry. Needless to say we will not return. Overpriced for the quality received.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
5,Nancy O.,"Portsmouth, NH",0,10,,3.0,2015-09-24,I would be Giving 5 stars for the bartender who made me laugh after a long day and provided amazing service!!   I have ordered takeout a few times on my way home from work or during lunch and I always wonder why the portions are so much smaller than when you eat in the restaurant??? Either serve the same entree size or charge less for take out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
11,Nicole W.,"York, ME",0,4,,1.0,2016-01-26,will never go back! food was horrible chicken ceaser salad was burned and my husband hamburger was over done french fries was burned. the service waitress was great!! this happened not once but twice!! horrible horrible!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
8,Gary C.,"Stratham, NH",2,1,23.0,1.0,2016-02-22,Went there with my wife and 4 kids. The food was bland and the carrots which came as a side for my daughters were so old from being in the fridge they were white and dry. The French onion soup was tasteless and very greasy from the mozzarella melted cheese on soggy bread. The Coke had no fizz. Won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
6,J F.,"Poland, ME",0,10,,1.0,2016-04-17,The food was great the person who seated us was great.The waitress came twice to take the order and the bill I literally had to push a button to get a refill on a day they weren't busy and didn't get it until my meal was done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
3,Alan B.,"Providence, RI",2,34,,4.0,2016-10-15,"I've been here 4-5 times in the last two months, since it's right around the corner from my work. Pretty decent atmosphere, clean, friendly waitstaff. The service is usually plenty attentive, though I tend to come in at off-peak hours. The food is good, pretty typical of what you would expect at an Applebee. I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could: 4 star waitstaff and atmosphere and 3 star food. I'll probably keep coming back because of its convenient location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
2,Doug P.,"Wells, ME",36,83,11.0,4.0,2017-01-21,It's Applebee's.. they do a decent job with service.. food is always hot and cooked well.. we only visit this chain a lot because it's kid friendly and my daughters love the oriental chicken salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
1,Nick L.,"Durham, NH",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-06,"I honestly have no idea how this restaurant is even still in business. The margaritas tasted like water (which the bartender informed us of as he gave them to us), they took 40 minutes to get us our food (2 of the orders were wrong), burgers were all well done when requested they be medium rare, and the waitresses were nowhere to be found the entire time. Its like they weren't even trying. Do yourself a favor a go to one of the other 200 restaurants in the Seacoast, and save yourself the nausea and over priced frozen food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-5,,,,,
