However, apparently the request of NO lemon was lost on her ... when I asked for another water w o lemon, she simply brought me back the same water out of which she had simply plucked the lemon wedge - with floating lemon particles still in the water! Do people seriously think the taste of lemon is no longer in the water?!? The all-you-can-eat ribs was certainly not worth the wait. They took almost as long each time to come out as the first time, not to mention I was never asked which flavor I wanted. I stopped asking for more simply because I was tired of waiting so long.  Another portion of our food came out stone cold. Lindsay refused to touch the food to test the temperature, claiming it would violate her status as a vegetarian. Good grief ... Overall the food was edible (for the most part), but the service was horrible and severely lacking. When we complained about the temperature of the food, no manager ever showed up to our table.

Sat there for six minutes and never saw the bartender. Two different servers came behind the bar to pick up glasses, looked at us sitting there empty handed, and went on their way. We walked out.

She's lucky she got a tip at all! 10% was being generous and that was only because it was Thanksgiving, not her birthday. We had to ask for refills, a box, and our check. I'm not sure that she even checked on us once. Now, let's talk about the food. Mediocre at best. Everyone's fries were cold. My husband's brisket enchiladas were pretty good. I ordered appetizers. The sirachi shrimp were good, but the chicken wonton tacos were not. I ate them, but only because we hadn't eating since breakfast, we'd been hiking, and it was Thanksgiving so I knew I wasn't going to be eating again anytime tonight. When we gave her the money for the bill, which included her gracious 10% tip she looked over at our table and glared at us. Some nerve. We should have asked for our change and only left her a penny! Management must really suck at this place. We saw workers with their hats all sideways, looking like gangsters, and the hostess half laying down while standing at the hostess stand. As a former food service worker, this would have been completely unacceptable at any of the establishments that I had bartended or waited tables at.

It had just opened, manager was vacuuming and I had to walk past him in order to get to the bathroom. Our waiter finally took our order and brought or beverages. Eventually he took our order. Simple 2 burgers and wings and onion rings. By the time the food finally came we were nothing but disappointed. All my 91 yr old grandma wanted that day was a burger, she got a hard bun over done burger and wouldn't eat it. My dad never got his onion rings and didn't like his over cooked boneless chicken wings. He said he would take them home for the coyotes, maybe they would eat them. After waiting another 10 minutes for our check we left. I then had to take grandma somewhere else to get lunch.

17,David V.,"Prescott, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2017-06-12,"No reason to return. Gave it two attempts a month apart. Neither time was it busy. First visit had a horrible server. Second time, no less than 6 different employees attended to us, but it seemed like none of them could figure out if they were responsible for the table. Only really pleasant one was the greeter. Food took way too long to arrive, as did drink refills. Not a single decent item on the menu for non-meat folks ... except the crappy pasta dish sans chicken that cost more than $10, and sized more like a kids meal.  Several better choices in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
16,Mark H.,"Camp Verde, AZ",2,3,,5.0,2017-07-14,Took my family for the first time to Applebee's tonight. I am actually shocked at the bad reviews I see on here because our food was delicious. The staff were so friendly and helpful that in the end my wife and I decided to up the gratuity to 32%. That's a good tip for great food and service. My family and I plan on returning and we hope it will be just as good as it was this time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
13,David V.,"Flagstaff, AZ",18,7,,1.0,2017-08-03,"Unimpressed yet again. I like to places a few chances at redemption but I regret this one. Food was alright but as I said unimpressed. The service is pretty bad, even as I sit here on my phone writing this. We were seated directly under an air conditioning vent freezing us out. We requested to move just after ordering and were met with rolling eyes and no interest to accommodate. We moved our own drinks to a warmer table. We received our food promptly but had also within a minute after our check as well with a statement of ""of you need me let me know"" then had no other contact not even drink refreshers. We also paid the two dollars for the games at the table and they had reset the machine cancelling our games and leaving us with no way to pay. Needless to say we won't be back.

9,John R.,"Dewey-Humboldt, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2017-08-06,It took 30 minutes to get our meal which obviously sat under a heat lamp for 10 or 20 minutes based on how tough and dry our chicken was. The mac and cheese was missing one ingredient....cheese. The service was horrible. We wrote this place off years ago and now we remember why.  I'd give zero stars if I could.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
6,amanda r.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,30,,5.0,2017-08-20,"We came into town from the grand canyon to go to costco, and decided to stop for dinner. Mind you, this was the 3rd restaurant we walked into. It was originally my first choice since we dont have one out where we are, but i decided to try a local place. The first restaurant made us feel too young,  and then we were going to try augies. It was awful before we ever even got drinks... so applebees it was. I was a bit leery with all the bad service reviews, but the service and the food were great. The hostess and the waitress couldn't do enough to help us. If the other two local establishments were highly rated, I'm clueless as to what constitutes good service in prescott",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

1,Nicole P.,"Tualatin, OR",38,4,,1.0,2017-08-25,"Terrible experience. I took my 3 kids there. A petite 12 year old girl and 9 and 11 year old boys. Not overweight kids by any means. They all order of the kids menu for ""super hungry"" kids aka the big kids.... When it comes I thought it was a joke. Their ""angus"" steaks looked like a piece of charcoal on a plate with 12 fries included. The stakes were literally half the size of a card deck.... it was what I would give to about a 3 year old child. And for $5.99---- if you take the kids to Red Robin or Texas Roadhouse they would get ATLEAST 3x to 4x more... hell, a kids meal for little kids from McD's would be drastically more.  I was mortified and so were my kids. I will NEVER go back. EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
11,Sally E.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",18,18,,2.0,2017-09-11,"My kids and I went to Applebee's on Saturday the eighth of September. Was so disappointed, I had the fish and chips and a regular salad and my daughter had a chicken pasta dish with a salad, and my son chose three appetizers and salad. The waiter we had was great!!! I think his name was Al, he has the long gray hair. He was so attentive and friendly if the food wasn't so bad we would go back a lot just for his service!!! The salads came on a good size plate but the salad was the size of my palm, it has tiny cut up tomatoes and looked like bacon on the top. If I knew it had tomatoes and bacon  like that I would have asked them to not put them on. I just cleaned them off and ate my tiny salad. The next thing was the fish and chips, three pieces, good size but the breading on them made the fish taste and feel slimy. I took the breading off but the fish on the top was slimy. My daughters pasta dish had no flavor but she got a good amount and my son said his was alright but it was not the best. We have been to a lot of these restaurants and have not had a problem but we sure did this day, I was very disappointed I will not be going back.

Our waitress was annoyed by our presence. Long story short, food was subpar at best and it took about ten years to get it along with the check at the end. Bathroom was filthy and didn't look like it had been cleaned at any point in the past several months.

The side salad is good size with cherry tomatoes, romaine, bacon, large croutons, spinach.  All ingredients were fresh. The oriental vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The original burger comes with pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce.  The patty was juicy with an outer char. My husband said the 6oz steak was average. The cut of meat could have been better.  Broccoli and delicious loaded mashed potatoes were the sides.
