21,Michael J L.,"Plano, United States",9,21,25.0,1.0,2012-07-25,Walked out when the waitstaff thought that. Talking on the phone was more important than ever even saying hello,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
22,Bob M.,"Scott Depot, United States",0,6,1.0,5.0,2013-08-29,Karaoke on Wednesday nights with 1/2 priced appetizers!  That was a blast,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
19,Bryan M.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, United States",2,1,,3.0,2013-09-17,"Food has always been good, but the carside service is always extremely slow.  I have on more than several occasions got luke warm food due to the wait.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
11,Joe V.,"New Port Richey, United States",1,4,,1.0,2014-01-07,"6/29/2014 Three of us were seated in a corner booth with menu' and dinnerware.  After sitting there for twenty minutes and seeing people getting waited on after getting there after us,we got up and left. We will not go there again. The manager didn't come around to check on customers as other Applebee's we've been to.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,

16,Troy S.,"Greensboro, United States",1,9,,4.0,2014-05-14,Wednesday night karaoke brings in a crowd every time I've stopped in Princeton on Wednesday. Good food reasonable drink prices.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
18,Nathan R.,"Littleton, United States",0,3,,4.0,2014-08-20,"The service was very good, maybe the previous comments made a difference. Food was quick, beer was cold. Nothing outstanding, normal Applebee's.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
14,Kaitlyn C.,"Aiea, United States",0,4,1.0,2.0,2014-12-30,Nothing says classy like an employee throw down during dinner! Employees drinking at the bar when they get off and starting a fight with other employees.  10/10 dinner entertainment.  8/10 food,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
13,Andrea W.,"Princeton, United States",5,9,1.0,5.0,2015-10-17,Love the half price specials they offer here. The service was wonderful and the food/drinks were top notch.

10,Maximillian M.,"Princeton, United States",28,17,9.0,1.0,2016-02-02,"Our office ordered lunch today from this location.  We were looking forward to it.  I ordered the Grilled onion sirloin w/ stout gravy and red potatoes at $12.99 and a bowl of French onion soup for $3.99.  The potatoes were not cooked all the way through and the French onion soup tasted like they just added water to it and warmed it up this morning.  My co-workers ordered different salads which they were disappointed with the portions. Total ticket cost $84.65.  Also, a co-worker said he could have gotten a better burger at Hardees for half the price.  My suggestion is not to waste your time or hard earned money at this Applebee's location. We won't. It's just not worth it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
7,Jason H.,"Columbus, United States",9,2,,1.0,2016-02-21,"This reminded me of why my family no longer goes to Applebee's.  We had problems from the start. My wife tried to order the pick two lunch only to learn they do not have that on Sunday's. No offer from our waitress to modify or try to get something similar for my wife. My wife then asked what the sever had that was vegetarian since she couldn't order the tomato basil soup or Caesar salad she originally wanted. The sever looked confused and finally offered a vegetarian pizza.  Our order of vegetarian pizza, two kids Mac and cheese, riblets basket, and my Bruch all day burger took over an hour to get. Then we had all sorts of issues with our food. My wife's vegetarian pizza had congealed cheese, was slimy and greasy, she ate what she did with a fork. My daughters Mac and cheese was cold and chewy. Lastly my Bruch all day burger was burnt, well done and overly dry. The only person at our table who had a decent lunch was my son who had the riblets.  I normally would have sent our food back but we had already waited an hour for the first round and didn't want to have to wait any longer.  Other things that contributed to this 1 star review. We never got drink refills in almost 90+ mins at the restaurant. Never saw the manager or had someone ask why most of our plates were not eaten. Just here's your check for $50 and have a nice day.  We won't be back to this Applebee's or any others in the future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
9,Katina E.,"Montgomery, United States",35,8,,1.0,2016-06-26,Applebee's is my favorite restaurant... Usually. Not this one! We waited over 10 minutes and no one ever came by to offer drinks. I had to ask the hostess if our table was assigned to a server. The hostess then brought us our drinks and said the server didn't know that his assignment had changed. Really? The server was apologetic and attentive until we received our food. Only saw him once after that. We seriously waited 25 minutes with our hands folded under our chins before he asked if we wanted boxes. Not cool Applebee's. Thankfully the food was great.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
8,Luke D.,"Wilmington, United States",4,41,,5.0,2016-07-08,GREAT EXPERIENCE AT APPLEBEES! Wasn't expecting much when I walked over from the Microtel. Accommodated our dietary restrictions. Delicious wings and great beer specials to boot. Visited twice in the same weekend because we were so pleased.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
12,Kathy B.,"Princeton, United States",0,15,,1.0,2016-07-21,Ordered the chicken tenders and fries. It was cold and served on a metal baking pan covered in baked on grease. First waitor tried to seat us at a dirty table.  Waitress never came back to see if we needed refills. Had to ask a waitor for ketchup bottle was unclean. Too much going on at the bar. Too loud. Won't be back. Bathrooms were a mess,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
4,Paul V.,"Vestal, United States",5,230,606.0,3.0,2016-12-09,"no vegetarian dishes on Menu , come on! yes salad were there with meat or fish shrimp ? any way ordered grilled sandwich minus bacon, ham etc. Waitperson was nice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
5,Keith V.,"Hurricane, United States",60,13,7.0,5.0,2016-12-16,"The best Happy Hour in town, hands down! $1 off bottles and Brewtus beers! Where else can you get 20oz beers for just under $3?  1/2 price apps are much larger portions and better selection than the competition around town and quality is incomparable to the other chains. I love the boneless wings and pretzels with Blue Moon beer cheese dip!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
6,Sharon P.,"Saint Johns, United States",15,2,,1.0,2017-04-03,"After a long day of driving, we wanted a drink to relax before going to our hotel room for the night. This was the WRONG place to go! They had no Chardonnay at 8:00 on a Saturday night! So we ordered a vodka martini. They brought a glass that was 1/2 full including the olives! All of this took an inordinate amount of time, and we decided to call it quits and go somewhere else, which of course, took an inordinate amount of time! When we finally left I was ready to strangle our server! Do not go here to relax!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
3,Melissa B.,"Louisville, United States",519,1149,11949.0,4.0,2017-12-08,"Tony and I went to Pearisburg Va to get married, YES we eloped!!! After our marriage, we stopped at Applebee for a wedding day lunch.  They were very quick to get us seated, and our waitress was very nice. We both ordered Ice Tea but mine was unsweetened with lemon and lime, Tonys was southern sweet no lemon. We decided to get the two for $20 with a shared appetizer of Hot Boneless wings with Ranch dipping sauce, we ordered the Chicken Mozzarella and the Chicken Spinach Artichoke Pasta....OMG,  we shared and feel in love with both.  Portions were large, we took leftovers home for continued Wedding Day Dinner. Definitely would eat here again!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-princeton-4,,,,,
