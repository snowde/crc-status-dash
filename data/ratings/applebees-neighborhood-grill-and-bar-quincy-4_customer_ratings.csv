9,Sonna E.,"Quincy, IL",3,78,,3.0,2012-04-19,"Service is usually pretty good, though I have had a craptastic service or two before. The food is hit and miss, though somehow I find myself frequenting this place more than anywhere else. Often the same dish comes out way different than the last time. There is usually something on the menu that I like though, and I like the half price apps after 9pm. Really hated that they took off the all you can eat soup and salad option for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
6,Chris F.,"Milford, OH",48,105,232.0,1.0,2013-11-06,"Not much to say other than it sucks. Service is horrible. Been waiting 10 mins for my check while the server is on smoke break.  Want to get the Applebee's, chain restaurant feel. Come visit and see for yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
5,Jordan F.,"Springfield, MO",7,31,,1.0,2014-08-05,"My family and I unfortunately decided to have lunch the other day and it was definitely not the most pleasant experience.  Our server was nice but very slow with getting refills,  food, and ticket. She sure did take our order fast. Drinks were brought in dirty glasses. Food was brought out cold. The restaurant in general was filthy.  We definitely will not be going back. On a side note, they felt it was proper to play the Baby Got Back song. This is a family restaurant with kinds of all ages. Definitely not a good song to play in that atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
8,Don H.,"Quincy, IL",1,78,,2.0,2014-09-06,"Nothing special. Typical Applebee's- nothing exceptional. I suspect that If you've been to one Applebee's, they all pretty much seem the same. This one doesn't seem quite up to the standards of other ones I've been in. There are much better choices in Quincy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
7,Glenn W.,"Vermont, IL",37,781,,2.0,2015-02-15,"Our server Amanda, was wonderful but the experience goes downhill from there. Very pricey for food that looks and tastes like microwave dinners. Met a friend for a business lunch, neither of us really cared for the food. My tomato basil soup was about two stars, but only Amanda, and the service saved the two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
10,ML E.,"Quincy, IL",0,4,,1.0,2015-05-08,Server Brittany was awesome but she didn't have much to work with here. First the varnish was coming off the tables and were so sticky they felt like an outdoor BBQ & the silverware was still wet & stuck to the napkins. Then the draft beer was warm & the margarita wasn't chilled good and came with what looked like bread crumbs floating in it. The quesadilla was raw with only 5 tiny pieces of chicken & a small amount of cheese inside all 4 little slices. I sent it back & it was cooked longer but still no more filling added. When I complained the manager came & told me that because this is a half-priced appetizer after 9:00pm they were told to make them with only 1 oz of chicken. Salad had more dressing than lettuce. Steak dinner my husband ordered looked more like an appetizer rather than a meal. We've been here quite a few times before but each time it just gets worse & worse so we won't be going back. For the amount of money we spent it certainly wasn't worth it. Very disappointing!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
3,Abigail W.,"Independence, MO",0,18,,4.0,2015-10-31,I ate here with family on my birthday. We did the 2 for $20 special and I got the 7 inch steak with garlic mashed potatoes and corn plus a house salad. The steak was just right. The mashed potatoes were sooo good I wanted a 2nd serving of them.  The corn was more of a Mexican corn salad to my surprise but it was ok. The service was quick and good.  We were seated right away. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the flies. There were about 7-10 flies that dive-bombed our table the whole time we were there!   It was very annoying.  But everything else was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
4,Angie F.,"Quincy, IL",8,6,,1.0,2016-01-04,"Haven't eaten here in a long while due to bad experience. Decided to give it another go this past weekend. We had an awesome waitress who was sincerely nice. Unfortunately, our food wasn't good. I had a BLT which I thought would be difficult to go wrong with, but I was wrong. My son had a typical cheeseburger and was sick the rest of the night. The cheese sticks we ordered were the only thing that I enjoyed. Perhaps there are other things on the menu that are good but I have yet to find them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
2,Ben L.,"Quincy, IL",5,2,,5.0,2017-07-22,Their dishwasher was down and their bar Staff wasn't in a great mood but still gave me more attention and better service than I've got in 90 percent of other places. Huge comeback since I got served beer in a wine glass on my last visit!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
1,Jeff S.,"Boulevard, CA",3,10,1.0,4.0,2017-07-24,"We ate dinner here on 7-24-17. The waitress Jenna U was very friendly, helpful and attentive throughout the meal. The food was good and the restaurant was neat and clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
0,Kelly C.,"St. Louis, MO",0,5,1.0,5.0,2017-12-21,Good food and food service. Price was reasonable.  Got right in without waiting. Ruth did a great job as our server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-4,,,,,
