5,Will L.,"Christiansburg, VA",32,1,,1.0,2015-10-04,"Where to begin. Worst restaurant experience ever. We came in with a party of 6 and when we told the server she acted like we had just dropped a bomb on her. After standing and waiting for them to put two tables together for about 5 minutes (when there were a few large booths we could sit in) the server walked away without saying anything to us, then acted like we were idiots for not following her. Once we went to the table the whole thing was sticky and she only wiped off one of them. The server took forever to take our drink orders then spoke in the most quiet voice I've ever heard. All the employees have tattoos and look unkept and have bad attitudes. Two of us got the food 20 minutes before the other four of us. Ridiculous. Never coming back here again l.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-radford-3,,,,,

2,Jeff D.,"Radford, VA",9,79,24.0,1.0,2016-03-11,"We decided to go to Applebee's, because they have great appetizers (especially the wonton tacos and the pretzels & beer cheese) ... and to be honest, most of the food was at least decent. The service, however, was terrible; like truly awful. The first problem we had was with the menu, though. The menu lists a Long Island Ice Tea as $3 and underneath that it says ""Specialty LIT's"" are an extra $1. There are only two other LIT's on the menu. After my GF ordered one, we discovered that her drink was $7 (not $4). When we asked about it, we got a long detailed description of what comes in the so-called ""Specialty LIT,"" which by the way isn't described anywhere on the menu. Our appetizers were next, but they failed to bring us any sort of appetizer plates. So, we asked for some, but they never came. Since wonton tacos are pretty saucy, there was a mess all over the table. By now, I had finished my milkshake and asked for a glass water. Next, were the salad(s). We both ordered salads. Only my GF's came. So, I asked the waitress about it and she brought us two more salads (mine and hers). Clearly, she wasn't really listening to me, because we only needed one. Anyway, we explained again about the salad-situation, to which the server said ""well, I can't take it back to the kitchen."" (Also too, the salad plates are a little precarious. If you try to stab a piece of lettuce that's too close to the side, the whole plate will tip, dumping your salad all over the table). My water still wasn't there. So, we asked again for a couple of waters. She did eventually bring them to us, but failed to give us straws. By this point we were pretty frustrated, so we reused our old straws. (Ever drank water from a straw that was already used for a Milkshake? Believe me, a new straw would have been better). Finally, finally, after 90 minutes of sitting at Applebee's, our meals came. Sort of. My GF had ordered broccoli with her steak, but they brought her mixed vegetables, instead. When we pointed out there error, the waitress did bring her a side of broccoli. Not a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-radford-3,,,,,
3,Truthful S.,"Washington, DC",5,59,2.0,1.0,2016-08-07,"We've been to this location numerous times over the years and it's hit or miss - usually a MISS. Applebee's has a fantastic menu - that's all they have going for them. Last night we tried it again, as a complete fail. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant at 6:30pm on a Saturday night - so we thought service would be quick. WRONG-o! Slow service, slow food to come out. Undercooked vegetables, no sauces brought out for chicken tenders. Food was just ""eh"" when we finally did get it. Waiter didn't come around much and forgot to bring things we asked for. I don't think we will be going back here anytime soon.  APPLEBEE'S OF RADFORD - GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER - this could be a great restaurant, clearly needs better management or some management at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-radford-3,,,,,
1,Sarah M.,"Fort Hill, Lynchburg, VA",108,3,,1.0,2017-10-14,Food was great. Service was horrible. I never got a refill on my drink. And by the time my boyfriend and I finished eating our food it took us another 30 minutes (no I'm not Exaggerating) just to get our check. I will never return here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-radford-3,,,,,
0,John L.,"Rural Retreat, VA",0,6,,2.0,2017-12-05,"My wife and I went here for dinner while staying over for a Dr. Appt.  1. The waiter was very good even though he was new. We ordered spinach dip for appetizer and then we both ordered steaks and i asked for the shrimp skewer also. all was pretty good, my steak was more done than I like.  We both asked for a baked potato and broccoli for sides and I was told I could only have one side with my steak, like a scoop of broccoli will break the place. Really? 2 This is the only Applebees that I've been to that doesn't give Veterans discounts. I asked and they said No. 3. The bartender didn't know how to make a Cosmo. No, I wont eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-radford-3,,,,,
