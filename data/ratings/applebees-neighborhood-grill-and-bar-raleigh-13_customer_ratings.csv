46,Jeff L.,"Raleigh, NC",1,39,29.0,1.0,2012-06-24,"My son and I visited this Brier Creek restaurant.  Without exception every time I visit, I find something that impacts the experience enough to reinforce my decision for future visits. This time was no exception. We arrived and were greeted promptly by a young girl in her early 20's.  I specifically asked for a booth and she showed us to the bar area and said will a half booth be ok?  There were 7 empty booths around the outside bar area and I became firm that I wanted a booth.  So she walked us over and sat us, put our silverware on the table and walked away.  I was expecting a ""enjoy your meal"". I felt more like it was an act of inconvenience about what I wanted v/s what she wanted to give us.  The restaurant was only about 40% full so the request wasn't unreasonable. I've prospered that younger kids being your welcome and not listening to the customer is definitely a place I won't regard as a re-visit spot to eat.  I've had numerous experiences at this same Applebee's and every time I go, it's the same thinking... Kids are running the restaurant.  The server came promptly and took drink orders and we looked over the menu.  We ordered two soft drinks. Then we ordered the 2 for $20.  I got the sirloin my son got the ribs. He wanted the steak but there were not enough selections of sides. Rice, broccoli, mashed potatoes or fries were his choices. Our appetizer was the spicy queso blanco dip. Ordering this kind of special puts me in the thinking the volume for the special should be such that the food is fresh, will arrive quickly, taste good and be a great value. The chips and dip arrived. The dip needed a good stir.  There was what appeared to be grease floating in the top of the dip.  The chips were warm but very stale.  I know they were stale because there were only about 3 chips total that were light and crispy.  The rest were hard to bite and chew. There was also a large clump of several chips (maybe 10) that appeared to have been fried together.  I managed to pull and break this clump apart.  About then I started to look for the Manager to be walking around.  We finished gnawing on the chips right when the entrees came out so that distraction had me re-focused on the meal. The waitress was attentive but the food quality of the appetizers was very low. My son's ribs came in a carry basket. Not something I'd expect from a $12.00 meal on the menu. But he loved the taste.  He wasn't asked what type of sauce he wanted which we later found out he did have a choice. My steak was very small but likely the advertised 7oz. The mashed potatoes were chunky.  Not a bad experience just unexpected. The broccoli was tender and tasty.  Back to the steak.  I asked for A-1 sauce. I suppose Applebee's is determined to impress me as I didn't get an A-1 steak sauce bottle. Rather, I got a small container that had about 1 ounce of sauce in it. Duh on me, I expected a bottle.  At least that way I could confirm authentic A-1 sauce verses some knock off brand bought in bulk.  I dunno.  I just come to expect what I'm asking for and it seems like a half booth is a booth and steak sauce is portioned out to me. So it was at this time I realized what part of the problem was. Glancing around the place I noticed we were sitting across the restaurant in direct eye line sight of the managers office.  There, the door was opened, Facebook was on the computer and I saw the manager talking to someone in the office seeming to have a pleasant relaxed conversation. It was then I wanted my typical experience to happen.  I wanted a manager that cared about the customer experience to check on me.  I wanted to tell her just a few things were off tonight.  But not so much I wouldn't maybe give it a try one more time.  But that wasn't happening tonight.  So I just let them sit there and talk for perhaps 20 minutes while my 14 y/o son began to tell me what a manager is supposed to do for their customers. Seems at 14 he knew more about customer service than this trained manager did.  After the conversation was done, she closed the door and walked over to the end of the bar, and stood there.  Still expecting a walk by, another 10 minutes passed and no manager.  We were in there 45 minutes total and when we were leaving, I finally made eye contact with this talented example of leadership.  She held the door opened for me and said, ""Thanks for coming!""  I just smiled. gloating in the thought, of yep, your welcome.  Now let me get home to my computer and write a deserving review of this place. In closing some may have a very pleasant experience at this location from time to time.  I've lived in Brier Creek for over 4 years now.  Visited this Applebee's maybe 6 times and only remember having a good relaxing experience maybe 1 out 6 times.  Odds are I'm done with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-raleigh-13?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

The appetizer selection is just sad- everything reminds me of those Fridays frozen appetizers.  I got the three cheese penne- why? Idk, I guess I wanted to compare it to Chili's Cajun chicken pasta ...which is WAY creamier and more flavorful. Applebees pasta was not coated with sauce - just bits of melted shredded cheese. The chicken on it wasn't bad though- but smaller pieces than Chili's for sure. The price is almost the exact same as Chili's. I would recommend going to Chili's instead because they are better and fresher tasting overall...plus good management and new decor (def cleaner). Our server, Taylor was GREAT though.

When we were finally ready to order the item I wanted to order because it was in the insert in the menu was unavailable because it was not coming out until Monday.  Why is it in the menu at all?

This particular Applebee's is right in line with most of them.  Adequate, but nothing to write home about, food and service at a somewhat reasonable but rising price tag. Fish & chips was slightly overcooked and still very edible, but the shooter desserts were a real hit with my daughter.  It's always good to see her with a smile on her face.

That kind of over did it on the sandwich. You couldn't taste the meat either. The fries were like shoestring fries but a little bigger.  The wife ordered the cheese sticks and boneless banquet wings. She gives both items a thumbs up. They looked good and smelled even better. My son ordered Cheese Quesadilla with cheese sticks.

The employees would not volunteer to do the job. We had to ask the hostess to clean the dirty tables. So we could sit at a table. waitress not volunteer to wait on us.  we had to call a manager to get wait on. Waitress was slow to wait on us. Not want to write down the order. Said it is not job. We said it was. Next to last visit. Waitress gave us soft drinks and iced tea. With 3/4 ice. Waitress left and not come back. WE had to call the manager. And did wait on us. We got a complimentary beverage at our request for compensation. And contacted the credit agency for a refund we got. The last visit was the worst. We had to spend most of the time asking waitress to come to our table. And do her job. We asked her for compensation. She said talk to the manager. We talked to the manager. He said the customers are the problem. And his employees are always nice to people. We said we lost our appetite. Waitress not nice. And he said take the rest of meal home. And we said not pay. And said good-bye. And left. The food was good. Portions are big on a full plate of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-raleigh-13?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

11,Eddie P.,"Raleigh, NC",9,169,258.0,3.0,2016-09-05,"Food: 3.5 (Spinach/Artichoke dip appetizer, Blazin' Texas Burger, Hotshot Whiskey Chicken) Server: 4 Ambience: 4 Crowd size: 1/4 full Date/Time: 9/5/2016 9:30pm This Applebee's was clean and had a low level of noise with the small crowd and TVs on low/mute. The host was accommodating with the table selection and the server was attentive.  The appetizer came fairly quick, and the dinner almost right after we were done with the app. The app was tasty but the chips seemed to have been fried in oil that either wasn't hot enough or left in too long as they were on the stale-like side with a darker look to them.  The dinner was better. Overall, it's a good place to get good food, and worth it at the price offered for the specials (Monday burgers @ $7, and apps @ 1/2 off after 4pm).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-raleigh-13,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

Not to mention we counted 6 dirty tables around us and at least 4-5 serves just standing around rather then getting them clean. Just stopped here for a quick meal but will def not be back for sure. Hope the food doesn't suck.. Took them almost 1 hour to clean off the 8 top behind us. It was nasty to even look at, and another server is walking around cleaning tables that are already clean, rather then cleaning the dirty ones",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-raleigh-13,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
22,My N.,"Raleigh, NC",0,43,,1.0,2016-11-29,"Repeat walk in customer for 7 years. First time Carside customer. I sat outside for 5 minutes prior to my order time, as well as 5 minutes past my order time watching the staff inside laughing around and dancing. No acknowledgement that I was there. I had started to worry that my online order had not gone through.  In any event, the appetizer and desserts were fine - good even. The entrees were tiny. I've never seen such tiny portions in my life. I have little soup bowls at home and the contents of both boxes were not enough to fill either tiny bowl.  About 95% of the time when I go to a restaurant I bring a box home because the portions are always too huge -  if I had received these portion sizes inside the restaurant I would have sent them back immediately. Or think I was being Punk'd. Or both. I've seen child portions twice as big.  Maybe they do it deliberately because they know by the time you get home and realize what they've done it's not worth it to go back? I'm still just incredulous.

19,YayaDaRealDeal ..,"Durham, NC",0,4,,1.0,2017-03-05,"This is a place that I will NEVER attend EVER again!! Customer service was barely available to us from our waitress. We were basically asking whoever we could catch going by for things we needed. I ordered an alcoholic beverage and immediately sent it back because it tasted like water. I ordered the Crunchy Shrimp with fries and they had no seasoning and were slightly burnt. I used my card to pay for mine and a friend's food and they swiped my card for one ticket instead of two and they couldn't find my receipt because they were so unorganized so I just gave up on trying to be a honest person and ended up not paying for my bill at all because they couldn't even find my ticket.

8,Ryan M.,"Garner, NC",68,84,58.0,3.0,2017-11-04,"In my opinion this place exudes the very definition of three stars, not bad, but not really that good and absolutely nothing impressive. The menu at Applebee's is quite boring, they really need to add something unique. I got spinach and artichoke dip, along with fish and chips. I will say that the fish was cooked rather well. However the dip seemed a bit watery for both my and my dates taste. She got the Sriracha fried shrimp pasta, which was rather cold, in fact the plate was warmer than the food was. From other reviews I've seen that seems to be a common trend here for some reason.

Bartender Linda decided to ignore it. She is the worst bartender of Apple Bees. I have been coming to this place from 5 years. I know almost all managers and bartenders personally. But this time, it was horrible. Linda is worst person with no smile and let those people continue making racist comments on brown guy. She made worst Long Iceland Ice tea, I ever drank.

12,Ron T.,"Durham, NC",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-04,"My wife and I were taking a well deserved break and last Friday decided to visit Applebee's. We had not been there for over a month and liked the ads we saw for their new dishes. We were seated promptly after our arrival - no waiting - and got the table for 2 we wanted. We watched and waited patiently as servers walked past us - no acknowledgement we were there or acted like they even cared. Several tables behind us the waiters and waitresses were having a ball. After waiting 10 minutes, I stopped one of the waitresses and informed here we've been here - as you know because you've walked past us several times - and not one of the joke telling, slopping dressings, unkept looking staff thought to even bring us a glass of water. So, after complaining, a waitress came out and promptly serviced the 2 people recently seated behind us. I told her we were here first and she looked at me like ""That's your problem!""  I have never been to a restaurant with Millionaire wait staff who didn't acted like they didn't need the job or the money.  Needless to say, I escorted my wife out of there and on the way out I asked to speak to the manager. I knew we were in trouble when she came out of the kitchen looking like she just woke up and toothpaste was not her friend. I complained as nicely as I could and we went several doors down to a steakhouse - had the best service, the food was absolutely delicious, and we left a 30% tip - our usual for excellent service. But, the super-rich wait staff at Applebee's didn't need nor want our measly little 30% tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-raleigh-13,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
