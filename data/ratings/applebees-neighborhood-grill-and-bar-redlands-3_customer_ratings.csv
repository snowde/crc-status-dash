64,Paula K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,17,,3.0,2012-01-13,"Friendly service, they were short staffed so the wait to get our food was a little long. Don't know if this is a regular thing or not at this location.  Meals- we had the bacon cheeseburger and substituted the onion rings. Burger was thick and juicy, bacon was a little overcooked but overall thumbs up. Onion rings were limp and worn out looking. Tasted alright but not worth paying extra for. Caesar salad was excellent. Just the right amount of creamy dressing and thinly sliced pieces of Parmesan cheese. Rivals what you get in much more expensive restaurants. Definitely worth the extra $2.50.  I ordered from the under 550 calorie section. 7oz sirloin steak was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Came with some roasted potatoes and a big mushroom with with a creamy spinach filling. It was perfect when you don't want a heavy meal. This place is perfect when you feel like a casual ""I just want to sit down and get something to eat that is not fast food""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=80,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
23,Kirari S.,"Colton, CA",303,181,691.0,3.0,2012-03-03,"This place is always the hang out at night. But at lunch it's pretty good for it's price and if your looking to count your calories and/or on weight watchers.   This place is like a step above Denny's/IHOP and below BJ's. So in essence, it's like a Red Robin or Chili's. While some people think that all American food is the same everywhere, it's not.   Every time I've been here the service has been good. It's not like they drop off the face of the earth but it's not like they come every 10min checking up on you either. Their lunch menu is good and is decently priced. This time around I tried their Weight Watchers menu and had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with rice and spinach. It wasn't bad. The spinach was a bit dry (on top) and had no taste so I had to squeeze lemon on it and mix it around so it got all moist again. The chicken was juicy and a good size and was pretty good. It's made for WW points so don't expect like major uber flavor. It's chicken that was seasoned well and had flavor (but something that can be made at home for a lesser price).  In my previous visits the spinach and artichoke dip is always good and for sharing.  This place is great for late night happy hours (for those $5 silver shots) and appetizers and great for big parties. And just to let some know: Chili's uses boxed Velveeta mac n cheese and a majority of their food is never fresh and always frozen. I've heard so from the employee's who work there and don't even eat there. Also the cooks are not trained cooks. At least at Applebee's I've had better food for cheaper price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=60,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
35,Cassie J.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,33,2.0,4.0,2012-05-04,"First, I wanna say CHILLIS IS NOT ALL THAT everybody seems to big up chillis like it is the end all and be all of restaurants in redlands. I went there with family and my experience wasnt worth the hype. It  was second best because we couldnt Applebees that day.  We was already in the area of Chillis. Chillis look like a abandoned old ass ship from the little mermaid. I will save the other comments for the Chilli's review. Now on to Applebees :), So me my daughter and sister went to Applebees and we had a good time. Decor is nice the atmosphere was up to my standards. Lots of festive colors and lighting, the bar in the middle. The plasmas up everywhere showing the lakers game, what more can you want. The appetizers were awesome, my favorite is the potato thin crisps with the spinach aritchoke dip, the boneless buffalo wings, Of course we did the 2 for 20 deal. The meals was good on my end, except my sister ordered a steak and it wasnt fully cooked, basically not as it was advertised. But the staff was cool about it and didnt interrogate my sister. They simply came over and apologized and gave her a second order and it turned out to be of her liking.  They didnt charge us twice.  HAPPY HOUR IS ON POINT! 3 bucks for cocktails such as long islands long beaches and stuff I enjoyed that very much :)  it wasnt watered down. OH YEA WE CAN ACTUALLY DRINK AT THE TABLE UNLIKE CHILLIS' WHERE YOU CAN ONLY DRINK AT THE BAR! wtf The staff had good chemistry with each other as well as the customers. It seem like the manager knew the ppl personally and went to their tables and held meaninful and cordial conversations Never treated us any kind of way, very considerate. We came few more times after that , still was great service despite the busyness of the restaurant. We will be coming back again really soon.

I have to say this was a very good salad, the only complaint I have is I wish they had more chicken.  They offer a full and half portion, I got the full portion as decided by the waitress.  I guess I looked hungry.

THE STEAK: My god, the food here sucks. I ordered a sirloin steak that was advertised on the menu as either 8 or 9 ounces (I don't remember exactly which). Part of the problem with picture menus is that the pictures show a BIG beautiful steak shot by a professional food stylist in a studio set up. What I got on my plate instead was the saddest, misshapen piece of low grade beef I think I've ever seen. If you look at the picture I posted, you'll see that the size of this thing barely qualifies as a chicken tender. And it was basically slapped on a plate and previously frozen French fries thrown on the plate. After dinner, I asked my mom if I could pop one of her muscle relaxers because my jaw was so sore from gnawing on this piece of meat that had the texture of rehydrated beef jerky. THE TABLE: As I was praying to God to make me a bird so I could fly away... far, far away... I looked up, and on the wall of our booth was a big collage of pictures of the local police department. Okay, I get that this big corporate giant is trying to fool people into thinking that they're a local community restaurant by posting pictures of local firemen, little league teams, etc. But honestly, this is the most awkward, inhospitable, and unappetizing thing you could put on the wall, just short of pictures of local morticians. You can see from the pictures I posted that I was looking up at pictures of SWAT teams, a militarized police force, and even a picture of some cop in full tactical gear on the side of someone's house with an HK MP5 submachine gun raised and ready to kill someone.

49,Danny V.,"Rialto, CA",565,71,49.0,3.0,2016-11-16,"I'm in a bit of mixed feelings with Applebee's to be honest. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible but still bringing up my tastes and distastes with them.  In the past, I have had extremely horrible service mixed a bland menu or maybe just my luck catching bad cooks on duty (In my opinion based off 10 years of memories). My definition of bad service: not refiling my drink; forgetting about me at the table; waiting an extended period of time to be seated, take my order, or just check to make sure I'm still alive. I will state a huge award winning thing that they do is show MAJOR support to military veterans. Myself being a disabled veteran I often find that companies off other discounts but elect to lookover veterans. Thank you Applebee's for being a huge supporter in supporting the troops and veterans. My most recent visit to Applebee's (the visit at this location in Redlands), I ordered Pomegranate Lemonade and the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi. First I'll speak on the ordering system, I absolutely love it, it makes ordering quick and easy, as well calling over a server as respectful as possible at the click of a bottom rather than at the snap of your finger. Even upon checkout paying on the system. Being seated and bringing the food and drinks is the only true thing the server has to focus on (the most important part of the experience next to their knowledge on the food if there is any questions.) My Pomegranate Lemonade was great. The balance of syrup and lemonade was very even. As well, the syrup having fresh Pomegranate pieces in it. Very refreshing. As far as the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi, I don't have much to say.. Not a good thing but not a bad thing. It was just ok. Sauces consistency wasn't as thick as I'd like it to have been, was a bit thin (in my opinion but as it cool it thickened to what I would of wanted when it was hot.) Additionally, it was very light on chicken, cheap option to save a bit of money? Possibly. They chicken was nicely blackened, I did enjoy it. Overall the pasta was decent. Not the best but no the worst by far.  I waiting a bit before getting seated but over all the service and servers where awesome. One complain I do have, although, I understand for profit reasons. The manager asked (trying to convince change my selection) me to change my lemonade to a margarita. Myself being in recovery from drug/alchole addiction I wasn't to please with what seemed to be pressure to drink an alcholic beverage. I have no issue with declining but I know others that are fresh in their recovery that may not be able to. Other than that, service was great. It's Applebee's. Great for lunch and happy hour.

1,Marcia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,348,398.0,5.0,2016-11-24,"Went for a late lunch and I ordered my favorite salad, Oriental Chicken with a side of extra dressing because they don't give you enough. My son ordered a chicken finger basket, these 2 entrees were the best options for the 2 for 20 deal, which comes with an appetizer. Our server was great and checked on us for refills. Then a manager checked on us and they had a notice on the menu holder that if your server doesn't offer one of their gift cards to buy then you get free dessert. We brought that to the managers attention, and she said that he hadn't checked us out just yet with a bill. So basically, give him a chance. So we did. He came by and we did order dessert. After that he brought the bill, in which the manager was with him. Still he didn't say the offer. The server said, he wasn't aware of that, even though the notice is on every table. The manager took him to the register, and she apparently took the dessert charge off. Thanks to my son, who was on it because I didn't even want dessert. I say all this to commend Applebees to sticking to their word.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88

I wasn't completely wrong with what type of people this place brings in but the food is good! The drinks are super cheap during happy hour/Sundays and they have enough tv's to catch any sport I'm trying to watch. I'll be honest, my wife and I have to be in an Applebees mood to eat here. This means that we don't care what kind of service we get, we don't feel like spending much more than $30, and I may or may not be wearing slippers so that I fit in with the other guests lol. Only on a few occasions do we not sit at the bar. Some of the local oldies seem to like to try and chat with everyone at the bar no matter how far away you sit. All and all, we like having a place to go where we have zero expectations and want something cheap. We have found multiple things on their menu that we end up craving. The mac and cheese with chicken strips is so tasty. As long as nobody we know sees us walk in there we will keep eating here.

Now they just stand there watching you come in with a dirty look on their face. The past few times we've been seated and we didn't have any dish ware up the to point when the food arrives we still didn't have spoons or forks. This last visits some young lady walked passed our table very quickly and dropped off the spoons and forks but slamming it on our table and walked away saying nothing. How rude was that!? We always seem to have two to three different waitresses though out our course of dinner. There's no bond with one waitress when you just got 3 different people bringing you food, drinks and appetizers. Food is never hot it's warm as well.

Last time I was here I received the dirtiest silverware ever and my artichoke dip was freezing. During my last visit tonight (my friends suggestion) the floors were all disgusting and dirty with food and debris. Seating areas were all dirty and stained with old foods. Nadia the very pleasant and polite hostess seated us and took our drink orders at 8:58pm our waitress (who we understand was overwhelmed) did not see us until 9:14 -I was on my phone once she arrived. I understand it's just a Thursday but perhaps staffing should be amped up when it comes to your happy hour. She was dealing with too many tables and had no problem expressing that to us as we wAited for her to take our orders. I got a 4- cheese mac and cheeses with chicken fingers. IT WAS FREAKING COLD. Even had my friend try it to see if I was being dramatic and she called the waitress to have it reheated. I gave the waitress the plate with 5 chicken stripes and two spirals of macaroni taken out. She returned it with  3 chicken strips and the entire plate in disarray. I let it go for my friends sake. But I will never return and never advise my guests to waste their time/money  on this place.
