11,Felipe Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",372,450,48.0,4.0,2012-07-20,"So I've been to this Applebee's twice in my life. Rexburg is a funny place to go visit, as you realize that probably your most ""fun"" eating out experience in the town is possibly Applebee's. The food is fine, the service is good, and have some deals. You've gotta laugh at some of their deals, as you see that Rexburg being a college town with cheap students, trying to get as much as they can for the least amount of money, applebees has been a victim of those hungry souls, and has had to put some conditions to their deals, like having to buy a drink in order to buy half off appetizers or things like that. Also, this applebee's does not have a full bar (go figure) only beer and wine are served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001
8,Karen M.,"Phoenix, AZ",187,504,841.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"We only came here because most other options in Rexburg were closed (it was Sunday).  Not much to say, as I'm not a ""chain"" restaurant fan, but since we were hungry, it did the trick.  I had the spinach and strawberry salad (only offered in the summer) and hubby had the ""Cowboy burger"" (bacon and other goodies).  We split the triple madness chocolate cake.  Fat, salt, sugar = check.  Not the healthiest dinner, but tasty.  *hangs head in guilt and shame* PS -- this Applebees does NOT serve alcohol on Sundays!  Keep in mind that Rexburg is mainly Mormon/LDS....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
28,Jaaron E.,"Parker, CO",4,25,1.0,1.0,2012-08-04,"This is a terrible applebees. Worst I've ever been to. Slow, sassy service, terrible food that's normally lukewarm by the time it gets to me.

24,Austin H.,"Provo, UT",161,136,63.0,4.0,2013-08-04,"My wife and I have been here several times, and we usually do the 2 for $20 deal.  The baby back ribs are AWESOME (even better the second day from leftovers). The bourbon chicken was not very good but the sides, and appetizers are usually great. We have had great servers who will check on us often.The food can be disappointing, but it just depends on what you order, as other items are delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2?start=20,,,,,
13,Tricia J.,"Portland, OR",9,34,17.0,3.0,2014-04-11,"Slow service,  didn't get my drink til after my food came.  It was busy time but still had seats open and only 5 minute wait time.  Food was so good,  love the wedge salad and tortilla soup.  Seems to be the only place on Rexberg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,,,,,
22,Jailynn Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,14,2.0,5.0,2014-06-25,"I pretty much always get the Shrimp and Parmesan Steak with mashed potatoes and I love it!!!! I think if you order the right thing, you will not be disappointed. This is probably one of the best sit down restaurants in Rexburg! I also like getting their Mountain Dew with flavors like raspberry in it. I've had bad service before, but I have had bad service once or twice anywhere. That is just the nature of the food business! It doesn't really sway me from going there in the future. I usually go when they run Dealios!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2?start=20,,,,,
23,JJ J.,"Spanish Fork, UT",78,68,23.0,3.0,2014-07-16,We paced a take out order online and walked in to pick it up.  It felt awkward because they did not seem to get many takeout orders and I did not know where to stand or go.  Very confusing.  Normally restaurants have a place you can walk up to that says take out.  I gave them a 3 star because of the confusion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2?start=20,,,,,

16,G H.,"Boise, ID",20,23,,3.0,2014-07-28,"I sat at the bar and felt the service was pretty good. I ate the Chicken and Portobello meal, and it was tasty. However, I was disappointed that they only serve beer and wine in terms of alcohol. But apparently,  it's the only place in Rexburg that even serves any alcohol. Overall though,  it was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,,,,,

14,Ammon S.,"Westminster, CO",5,25,,1.0,2015-10-17,"I write so few reviews...but last night's dinner was a rare nightmare.  I ordered the ribeye steak medium well with a baked potato and veggies.  I later added a side salad.  After a 25 minute wait, the food arrived.  The manager preemptively came out to apologize for the wait.  Nothing was offered.  He should have waited around.  The fun was just getting started.  They gave me cold mashed potatoes instead of baked.  My steak was rare and bloodied rather than medium well.  I had to ask twice for my salad, which, while large, was filled with largely discolored lettuce.  The final straw was that they changed the channel on the one television broadcasting the ALCS baseball game with my hometown team playing.  I asked if we could change it back and the response was that they couldn't since other customers made the request to change it.  What am I?  This was a lousy experience.  I know it's Rexburg, but--c'mon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,,,,,
19,Elizabeth J.,"Keaau, HI",0,3,,1.0,2015-12-31,"FOOD POISONING!!!! If I could give this ZERO stars, I would!?! We've never been here to eat so we were excited when we finally got the chance to go. I ordered ""riblets"" which usually don't have bones or fat--boy was I wrong!?! It was mostly bones and fat than meat!?! The waitress was ok but it was a very hectic, loud, and overwhelming atmosphere. We took home our leftovers and within 24 hours, everyone in our family got food poisoning. It was the WORST!?! Someone said that they fry their fries in the same oil as raw chicken which makes the fries bad if you eat leftovers. Well, between the leftover fries or the riblets we brought home and ate the next day, we were all vomiting for the next 24 freaking miserable hours of our lives. NEVER AGAIN APPLEBEES!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,,,,,
9,Marc B.,"Gilbert, AZ",77,35,15.0,5.0,2016-01-16,"I've been to this Applebee's many times. It has been uniformly excellent with great attention to detail and a very friendly, professional staff. I've been very impressed with it. Not only the quality and the innovation of the food but the presentation and johnny on the spot service. I think that it is unfortunate that someone will have one bad experience there and condemn the place for all time. I think I speak with some authority because I've been there at least a dozen times. I don't want this to sound like any type of slur on Rexburg, but this restaurant is much better than Rexburg deserves, in the sense that Rexburg, even though it has a gigantic college, it's still pretty out-of-the-way and this is awfully professional food for an out-of-the-way town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,,,,,

4,Brandon S.,"San Bernardino, CA",22,38,6.0,1.0,2016-06-12,"My wife and I just had dinner here, boy it was a mistake.  The place was in the middle of a slow part of the day, so we thought that we would get good, fast service. Instead, we got cold food and it took far too long to get our drinks and to-go boxes.  My wife ordered a burger with no onions or pickles, and when it arrived, it still had them.  I ordered a $17.99 12 oz steak, medium well with cheddar bacon potatoes and mac and cheese. The steak was a tiny little square of well done, gristle-filled meat, and the sides were slightly above room temperature. Not only that, but they put so much parsley on both my sides that it looked like someone dumped a bag of yard clippings onto my plate.  We ordered lemonades (kiwi and pomegranate), and they were so tart that we couldn't even drink them. They obviously used syrups instead of real fruit because they had a fluorescent color to them.  All in all, stay away from this place unless you want overpriced mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

3,Marv M.,"Rexburg, ID",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-28,"What has happened to this place? Server seemed upset upon greeting our table, hostess was talking poorly about someone she worked with when my party and I came in (tip: don't bash your coworkers in front of customers), and the burgers and fries were cold for me and the two others I was with. I noticed there was some ""gunk"" stuck to my plate so I asked for another one (no biggie, I have gunk on my plates at home sometimes too, the dishwasher misses stuff or I don't rinse well, but anyway... I wasn't mad, just wanted a new one) and the server rolled her eyes and later we overheard her talking about us being ""needy."" We didn't ask for anything besides a clean plate and didn't complain when our drinks weren't refilled or that that the food was subpar, so I am unsure how we were needy. I used to love it here, but between employees acting immature and cold food, I will go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rexburg-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

He was funny, nice and filled our drinks always when we were out. We just got a couple appetizers and desert. Everything was pretty good except we asked that our desert come a little later and they ended up making it too soon and came about 2 minutes after our appetizers.
