17,James W.,"Richland, WA",2,48,10.0,4.0,2012-03-14,"Casual dining means a lot of the food appears to be pre-packaged and prepared; I imagine the kitchen is more like an assembly line than a chef's workstation.  I like they are open late since there are not many options for late night dining in Richland.  I've never had a bad experience at this location, other than my wife and I having our drinks switched when they arrived at the table.  If that's the worst they got, I'm ok with that. When I visit a restaurant like this that has my favorite sandwich on the menu, I have to at least try it once - a Reuben, and they do a decent job with theirs because it's usually what I get every time we eat here.  I also can't do a visit without the chicken wonton tacos, especially when they are prepared properly.  This location has far better service and food quality than the Pasco Road 68 restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
23,Patti C.,"Yakima, WA",30,13,7.0,4.0,2012-06-04,Very good service & food. Have found that we can count on Applebee's when we're away from home (Yakima).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3?start=20,,,,,
21,Monika H.,"Seattle, WA",10,105,8.0,4.0,2012-06-28,"Ate at the bar, where the bartender Matthieu was serving. Good garlic steak, he made a good mudslide, however, i wish i had been asked to make it a double, but it was still yummy. and they had mac&jacks on tap, awesome! you know the deal is applebees, tasty food for reasonable prices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3?start=20,,,,,
18,Romar S.,"Richland, WA",0,10,,4.0,2013-03-05,"Service was good, food was OK.  A ""loaded"" potato costs an extra $2 which the server doesn't tell you when they ask.  Shows up when you get the bill.  Applebees is taking a lead from the airlines.  Next thing you know salt & pepper and ice will be extra!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
22,Sarah M.,"Kennewick, WA",2,39,20.0,3.0,2013-09-22,"I minus a star for the poor ish service. The wood was wonderful, loved their ribeye steak with baked potato and steamed veggies. Beware that when you order bake potato, they put a good amount of sour cream and butter right on top. I also had their Ultimate Trio Appetizer and I picked the Steak ...steak something (sorry forgot the other part of the name) the Grilled chicken wontons, and the cheeseburger slider. All 3 was fairly amazing except that my steak wrap thing wasn't a cylinder shape like it showed in the picture but rather a odd triangle. Only had some sort of sauce and tomatoes, the cheeseburger slider only had the burger (which was good) and onions...no cheese despite its name, and the wontons were amazing I loved those.  But the service was alright. He gave us good attention but bad attitude or ""vibe."" We came in around 12:15 (45 mins before they closed) and there was other people there too. Plus we asked if it was alright if we came in to eat and the waiter sound very happy and said yes. But as soon as we sat down, his personality changed. He never smiled, and it felt like he rushed us, even though we left at 12:50 ish. So that wasn't pleasant. But either way, food was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3?start=20,,,,,

16,Eric H.,"Vancouver, WA",13,11,,2.0,2014-02-09,"I was in town on business. I'd never been to an Applebee's before and a co-worker wanted to go there. I was not impressed. The menu was meh. There was nothing on it that stood out to me. I have a robust appetite and ended up ordering a steak because there just wasn't anything that shouted ""this is gonna fill you up!"" Add to that all the items listed with the little Weight Watchers logo and I was tempted to order two entrees. The service was below par as well. Our waiter only stopped by our table to take our order, bring us our food, and give us the check. I ended up stopping at Jack in the Box on the way back to the hotel for a cheeseburger and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
14,Angela V.,"Richland, WA",12,23,1.0,5.0,2014-07-07,"Applebee's server Rachel went out of her way to make my type 1 diabetic son comfortable with his food choices.  She even asked the manager to order a carb food guide for the kids menu,  so the next time we come in,  the info will be more readily available to us.  My son was so happy and felt secure in his lunch choices.  We will be back for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
20,Scott C.,"Pasco, WA",0,8,4.0,5.0,2014-11-26,"My coworker and I come here after our shifts at a place down the street and get drinks and boneless wings. S/o to Kayla and Natalie for being awesome servers. This place is awesome, especially the happy hour specials.

7,Jonathan G.,"Kennewick, WA",4,60,5.0,1.0,2015-01-12,Pity we can not give a negative score. The servers were more interested in a football game. Lousy slow service.  Salty chips with the dip.  Slow service. Use the table remote thingy. So much for service.  I had a metal spring in my butter with my baked potato.  Lots of jokes. Including the manager. No sorry. Sat around while they prepared another one. My wife's potato was burnt her steak was full of gristle So much for Applebee's. No one seemed to care and we got a full bill. Guess I will chat the health dept.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
11,Tyler R.,"Portland, OR",14,91,10.0,5.0,2015-01-20,I have been here many times and each time the food quality is consistent. I have had a little bit of everything here and it all is pretty good. I would recommend the Bourbon steak hands down! Happy hour here is pretty awesome!! Half price drinks and appetizers!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
10,Josh C.,"Richland, WA",2,7,,4.0,2015-02-15,"I went out to Applebee's for Valentine's Day Lunch with my wife and we were very happy with our visit. The host and wait staff were very friendly, very attentive, and overall did a good job. We also got a visit from the store manager who was roaming around just to ask if everything was tasting ok, and if there was anything we needed. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that my wife asked for her steak medium well, and i asked for mine medium, and they came out looking exactly the same, but I don't mind medium well either so I ate it, and it tasted fine, just not cooked how i asked. Overall Applebee's is great and i love stopping in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,
12,Vance L.,"Pasco, WA",1,2,1.0,5.0,2015-05-30,Ive had better food....and worse.   They get 5 stars though because the service is whats important to me.  Megan was awesome and created a friendly environment and provided spot on service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,

5,Steven H.,"Fairview, OR",13,76,62.0,4.0,2016-03-20,"I stopped here for dinner while travelling for work as there weren't  many options. I sat at the bar as it was pretty packed for a table in the restaurant. The bartender was great. She had a great personality and was totally on top of things. She checked up on me so regularly that I never needed to ask for anything. All the while preparing drinks for so many.  I tried ordering online the next night but there system will let you order everything, but won't allow you to put in a phone number, which is a required item. Needless to say, I decided to get takeout from somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,

6,Nancy A.,"West Richland, WA",0,10,,1.0,2016-06-24,"Wanted to try their new steaks.  Ordered an 8 Oz sirloin, garlicky green beans and cheesy crispy potatoes. Steak was smaller than the palm of my hand.  Definitely not 8 oz.  Potatoes came out after half the meal was gone.  Sad to say, garlicky green beans were the best of the meal and they weren't even fresh.  Done with Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,,,,,

1,Gayle H.,"Goldendale, WA",35,22,89.0,4.0,2017-07-01,"Went to this location for Dinner. The restaurant was clean,  the staff was friendly and attentive. The food was really good. My girls got the 2 for $25 deal. It came with a shared appetizer and two plates of ribs with mashed potatoes and green beans. My husband got the bacon burger with French fries and I got the You Pick 3 appetizer. With it I chose Steak Quesadillas, Wonton Tacos and Spinach Artichoke Dip.

2,Marti C.,"West Richland, WA",25,2,,1.0,2017-08-18,"This was probably the worst meal and service I have ever had at an Applebee's.  Our food was bland, the service was poor and the Manager was rude.  There were seven in our group and we unanimously decided to never return to this Applebee's.  We will return to the Kennewick store as the food is always good, and the service impeccable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richland-3,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
