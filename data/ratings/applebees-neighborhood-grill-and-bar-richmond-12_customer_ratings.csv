15,Adam C.,"Chesterfield, VA",94,86,240.0,2.0,2012-03-14,Drinks are usually priced well but they last few times the food has tasted like it was made in a microwave (sometimes even cold).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
14,Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"I remember going to Applebees as a kid and I can say the food has gone downhill. At this particular Applebees, the service was ok, but the food was pretty bland. There was nothing special about the dishes and no particular dish that I would want to eat over and over again. I recommend going to this restaurant when other restaurants of higher quality are full or busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
17,Mike W.,"Alexandria, VA",12,26,7.0,1.0,2012-07-21,"Food is well, Applebee's. I had the N'awlins Sizzling platter. It was great, except, it wasn't made with andouille, it was made with kielbasi, Yeah, no kidding....it drives me crazy when places take advantage of us like that.  Service sucked, I mean really sucked. It was as if it was a surprise that we were ordering food at a restaurant early on a Friday evening.  Anyway...it was food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
19,Patrick F.,"Richmond, VA",12,10,10.0,4.0,2013-07-11,Enjoyed the Roma Chicken and Shrimp. A tasty meal under 500 calories. I tried a bite of my daughter Blondie desert - Delicious! The server was attentive and pleasant. Overall a great experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
18,Jon P.,"Andalusia, PA",21,5,1.0,1.0,2013-08-02,Food was ok at best...appetizers came out after the main course and the waitress never asked to refill drinks or nothing...bad..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
16,Arnold G.,"Midlothian, VA",9,69,85.0,3.0,2013-12-22,"The Waitress did a pretty good job with 8 of us from Church. The food was pretty much the same as at any Applebee's. Everyone one said, when I asked how's your food, ""It's OK"", ""Not Bad!"", or ""It's Pretty Good"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
11,Robert B.,"Cary, NC",0,59,2.0,2.0,2014-03-18,This review is based on the fact that this restaurant screwed up a steak like I have seen in recent times even at a crappy family restaurant like this! They did not even make average here is why. Keep in mind general score avg! Bar service = decent and nice friendly bar keep as per normal Tomato basil soup = usual Bourbon street steak ordered extra rare cold inside..... Wtf! Half cooked through warm and looks like it was baked in a warming drawer!!! As I type this tempted to change it to a single star but it wasnt that bad overall.  To her discredit barkeep saw this and chose to ignore it.  Wont be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
8,Branden W.,"Burnt Hills, NY",5,7,4.0,4.0,2014-06-22,"You have to keep in mind it's an Applebee's. You get what you at for. I had the bourbon street steak. It had great flavor and was cooked just the way I ordered it. The steak was a little tough, but that's what I would expect from a $10 steak. The service was good. Our waiter was very attentive, and our food came out quickly despite a steady stream of customers. Overall it was a good experience, if I wasn't just passing through, I'd go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
9,J Lucas B.,"Midlothian, VA",126,2,6.0,4.0,2014-07-27,"The new menu is healthier and tastier! Everything on the Weight Watchers menu, like the Roma Pepper Steak, is under 550 Calories. Way to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
6,Ashley G.,"Richmond, VA",211,377,1696.0,3.0,2014-08-21,"The fries green beans are awesome!  Frozen or not they're awesome,  They're worth the extra star here.  The meal was overly expensive and went down from there.  The service was mediocre,  The three cheese macaroni with chicken tenders was terrible.  It tasted like one of those 98 cent pasta sides you buy from the store.  Yuk. It gave un-ending heartburn and up Chuck for the rest of the night.  My bread stick was hard and dry, and the 3.99 drinks are just hype.  They're small and they don't have much alcohol in them.  Waste of money.     Would I come back to this location,  nah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
10,Ross A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",61,24,19.0,5.0,2014-08-27,Went there late last night for a beer with some guys because the Sheraton bar was packed and only one server? We were surprised by three dollar tall drafts and half off appetizers.. Wow.. The staff at the bar were very accommodating.. We got pretzels and beer cheese and fried green beans both were very unique and delicious,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
13,B B.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,115,36.0,2.0,2014-11-28,Stopped in for lunch Wednesday before Thanksgiving with my wife.  We were greeted and seated by what ended up being our server.  She was loud and a little overbearing and boarding on the line of rude.  I ordered the cowboy burger it was undercooked and had an off taste needless to say I didn't eat much.  There really isn't much I can say good about this visit.  I have eaten here several time and it was much better it may have been an off day in the kitchen.  It was also the first time I saw the server we had i do know it will be the last time.  This visit would only be 1 star however being that I have eaten here several other time I gave it 2 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
12,Daniel C.,"Midlothian, VA",0,9,,2.0,2015-05-08,"Overall I feel like this particular Apple Bee's has gone downhill. The food was very bland. I had the House Sirloin which was over cooked based on my specification and lacked the overall great taste that I've had elsewhere. Garlic Mashed Potatoes left much to be desired, like the garlic and the portion was small. Mexi-rice was the second side which was average. The service was Inattentive overall. Might be a while if I return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
7,Natalie S.,"Clemson, SC",24,111,14.0,2.0,2015-06-08,The restaurant is so dark. Going in for lunch was just depressing. We had to ask the hostess to wipe off the booth we were sat at it was so dirty still. The lemons in the water felt slimy. Not normal.  The waiter was nice but the food came out in the weirdest order. The menu. The food. Thumbs down. Not many vegetarian or healthy options. The desserts were even bad! The churro smores I'm pretty sure is just Hershey syrup.  Dirty. Dark. Bad food. Pass.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
4,Crystal R.,"Richmond, VA",44,66,51.0,4.0,2016-03-26,Good service New updated technology for ordering  & gaming Food was good Always one available in good distance,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
2,Chris L.,"Midlothian, VA",67,459,18.0,3.0,2016-05-22,My kids and I have gotten to like going to Applebee's for a casual meal.  I think their food has continued to evolve and improve the last few years.  This location is a smaller building but cozy atmosphere.  The service has been good and the kids like the screens at table to play games / pay bill.  I would actually give this 4 stars except the heavy use takes its toll on cleanliness.  Even though this location was remodeled a few years ago (and still looks brand new from the outside).  It is a little worn on the inside.   Not enough to stay away or consider a real problem but enough not to give 4 star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
5,Nick S.,"Monroe, NC",0,17,1.0,4.0,2016-06-05,"We arrived just before noon on a Sunday. No wait and not many people inside. We had a party of three and our drinks were delivered quickly. Has a cool tablet at your table to order refills and they come fast! Food came quickly, about 15 minutes. Ours were hot and exactly as ordered. Was able to pay on the tablet too! Would definitely recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
3,Gromel B.,"Richmond, VA",2,45,32.0,1.0,2017-08-06,First of all the waitress brought me a regular tea when I asked for sweet tea we ordered our food and it has been over 30 minutes and we still didn't receive our food when we finally got our food I can say that it was good but the only thing we got offered for having to wait so long what is a free appetizer or dessert I mean really. This is the second time I have been to this location and I can see the cook team is slow hopefully they will improve,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
0,Sara H.,"Richmond, VA",36,33,12.0,5.0,2017-08-30,"Hubby and I had running around to do and dropped into Applebees for lunch on Friday.  I cannot for the life of me remember if it was early or late but the place was not crowded and we loved that.  We were greeted very courteously with a smile and asked if we wanted a table or booth.  That is also something we like, as we prefer booths, not sure why but we do.   Our server, I'll preface this by saying I am seriously wretched with names, however this one, I will never forget.  Our server's name was Fantasia, and she is a lovely girl with extremely gracious manners, who would befit an upscale restaurant.  That is saying a lot, her skill level surpasses this establishment.   That being said, the food was good! My eyes are DEFINITELY bigger than my stomach that is for sure, but everything was wonderful.  I cannot remember the name of what I ordered, some kind of meat stew thing on top of potatoes, and my husband had ribletts, we shared Mozzarella sticks, all cooked perfectly.  The meat was tender, and delicious, the food was not greasy or salty at all!  DEFINITELY will go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
1,Mz L.,"Richmond, VA",86,4,1.0,2.0,2017-12-30,"We arrived around 3:16 pm today. It's not busy. We were seated and the wait to be greeted began. After 1 minute the girl who would be our waiter looked me straight in the face and did not motion toward my table. She already had 2 other table occupied in her section. After 10 minutes, she finally greeted us and said she didn't know she was ""sat again""... complete bullshit. I ordered my regular spinach and artichoke dip which was a watery rush job but it was hot. My drink arrived after my appetizer was done and also contained a few strands of hair, which I i did not order. My sister specifically ordered her soup with my app... guess what? She had to remind the waiter to get it.  The manager ran our food where I returned the drink. The waiter has since returned to my table twice only collecting empty cups and plates on the second round. There are two more tables she had in this section and since we've been eating and the set was nearly instant.  I frequent this Applebee's because of the usually good service , price points and drinks but, it has successfully been removed from my totem pole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-12,,,,,
