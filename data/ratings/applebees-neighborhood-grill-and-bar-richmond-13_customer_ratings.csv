14,Brian J.,"Traverse City, MI",46,114,5.0,3.0,2012-01-30,"I was amazed at how busy this Applebee's was given the time of day. I came with my wife and 1 year old daughter at about 2:30 on a Saturday so that our little one wouldn't be a distraction to other diners. However, the place was packed! The thing that annoys me about Applebee's is that their menu is always constantly changing. Everytime I go it seems they have a new menu layout. I ordered a sandwich this time, and about 10 minutes after I ordered our server came back to let me know that they don't make this sandwich anymore. Really?  Then why is it still on the menu?  Especially since your menu changes every time I come in? I really didn't understand that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
17,Joshua G.,"Indianapolis, IN",67,158,204.0,3.0,2013-01-14,It's pretty ridiculous how busy this Applebee's gets on the weekends. I am not really big on these types of chain dinner places. The food never is very good and the service mediocre. The only time I come is when I get a giftcard or friends want to come on karaoke nights on Thursdays. My favorite thing is the spiraled potato chips with the white queso. Other than that I have no real reason to come here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
15,Carrie C.,"Kennewick, WA",2,49,15.0,1.0,2013-06-10,"Take you sweater and a blanket and prepare for awful food made poorly.....management was terrible, as was the hostess, but out waitress was wonderful, she is the one that earned the one star I gave. They rely too heavily on being the only such restaurant in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
18,Copper M.,"Richmond, IN",0,5,,1.0,2013-11-17,"When thinking 2 for $20 Applebee's is probably near the top of your list on where to go. It was for me until they continuously served bad food. I know that they get most of their stuff frozen and thaw it out the night before similar to how KFC next door prepares their meat, but the last 3 times I went I have gotten my steak asking for medium and received it with it being hot on the outsides and cooked and almost raw in the middle and a lot cooler. I also know people who have been hired to clean this place and  also have worked at many fast food places. They said it was the dirtiest kitchen they ever saw and probably is never cleaned by the staff. If you are looking for great food and service take the short drive over to chilis or o'charlies",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
11,Mia M.,"Indianapolis, IN",22,325,44.0,2.0,2014-01-04,"What can we say about Applebee's that hasn't already been said about every other continental dining chain? The food is predictably fried and salty. The draft beer is all boring lagers. Mixed drinks are heavy on the juice and ice. Everything costs a dollar or two more than it should. Still, this particular location stays busy no matter what day of the week it is.  Something mostly universal I've noticed about all the Applebee's I've visited is that the servers seem to be nice and efficient, but the kitchens are ridiculously slow. I don't know what's going on with their training, but timeliness seems to be glossed over or ignored completely. Be prepared to make some conversation with your dining companions, because after you get you silverware and beverages, there's going to be a lot of waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
12,Jamie A.,"Hamilton, OH",22,147,23.0,4.0,2014-01-09,"You know, most Applebee's are pretty much the same.  Some of them have ridiculously bad service but other than that, they're fairly standard.  Until I dined at the Applebee's in Richmond, I just assumed that all Applebee's served stale chips with their spinach and artichoke dip.  So, kudos for non-stale chips! Okay, so it's Applebee's. It's nothing special.  But, it's decent food at a good price.  Can you find tastier, more unique, options in Richmond? Sure.   I like their 2 for $20 option.  They have surprisingly good steaks.  I usually order mine medium well and I have never had a problem with that.  They have good lunch deals too.  Their tomato basil soup with their salad is really good.  The club sandwich is pretty tasty.  I'm also a sucker for french fries and I really enjoy Applebee's fries.  I just can't help it.  This location has good service - they're typically pretty busy (not much else to do in Richmond) but the wait is never really very long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
10,Cheryl W.,"Eaton, OH",51,5,1.0,4.0,2015-10-03,Curbside service was nice and convenient with small kids. but not much quicker than going in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
9,Joseph V.,"Lexington, KY",1,8,,5.0,2015-10-16,"As bad as it was last night, we gave it another shot and  tonight was an absolute delight.  Instead of Kara we need up with Tara!  What a difference a letter makes!   She was beyond charming.  Service with a smile.  She obviously wanted out party to enjoy our dining experience.   Hope the manager recognises what's going on in this place.  If I was the owner I'd be pissed that the place was being run like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
13,Michael B.,"Richmond, IN",157,4,,5.0,2015-10-22,Kara is an amazing bartender.. Those guys were just dumb and annoying as hell.. Moral of the story be respectful to your bartender and you will get better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
0,Barbara J.,"New Madison, OH",1,12,,5.0,2016-02-06,"Wow what a great dinner! My husband and I had a gift card and decided it was time to use it. Im glad we went to this Applebees.  The restaurant was clean, staff courteous, and our meals served promptly despite it being packed. Hubby played with the electronic ordering/ game console at the table!  A really great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
6,Jeff P.,"Lewisburg, OH",0,6,,4.0,2016-06-19,"I always get the bourbon street steak and this time the portion was smaller.  It used to be a decent sized steak, now it's two 4oz sirloins.  They were cooked perfectly though.  Everyone in my party liked their food.  The service is really good.  Our server, Joe, was spot on.  Overall, I've pretty much always had good experiences at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
8,Darren L.,"Richmond, IN",0,6,,1.0,2016-07-04,"The food was good, and that's about where it stops.  I typically like going to Applebee's, but not this one.  The dining area floor where we were seated was simply filthy.  You seriously had to watch where you stepped.  There was what looked like a used tea bag in the middle of the isle, and a dirty knife laying on the floor beside our booth, which, by the way, was still there when we left.  My wife asked for four different soup spoons before finally giving up and simply cleaning the food off of it herself.  We visited this location on a Monday night at around 7pm, so the crowd was very small, and there should have been no excuse for the place to be filthy like it was.  We will certainly NOT visit this restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
3,Jim P.,"Richmond, IN",0,4,1.0,2.0,2016-08-13,Upon arriving here was great. Then I place my order and was then told I couldn't get because it wasn't happy hour so then the manager Nick came to table and  was very rude and was not at all willing to help out with the situation. This was all over $2.75. If I didn't take care of my guest at work over something that small my General manager would be all up in my ass.if this is the type of management that applebees wants then I won't be back. Frickers here I come. My waitress should be attending in nicks shoes she was very professional,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
4,Gary L.,"Hope, AR",0,19,8.0,1.0,2016-08-17,"This has been the worst visit ever! After waiting 25 minutes, they said they do not have pork chops. When we did get our food it was overcooked and terrible. Mamager should be promptly fired!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
7,Cory W.,"Richmond, IN",0,2,,5.0,2016-11-07,Never have to get anyone's attention if needing anything. Bartenders always on top of their game. Great management and all in all great place to catch a game and enjoy a good meal and cocktails,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
2,M L.,"College Corner, OH",2,37,6.0,3.0,2017-01-25,The food was good but the service was really bad. I could understand the delays with our waitress if the place was busy but when we got here I counted maybe twenty people in the restaurant.  Back again and the service was little better but those bathrooms are a nasty place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
1,Daniel S.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,6,3.0,1.0,2017-04-18,Wow is not the word.  Staff is friendly but this is a sub par location even for an Applebee's.  Very disappointed in the quality of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
5,Peggy C.,"Eaton, OH",0,2,,2.0,2017-05-08,"I had not been there in a while. Had sticker shock at how much prices had gone up. We arrived after the rush and service was top notch. However the music was soo loud it was hard to talk over it. Also, it was so cold our food was cold before we were halfway done eating it. Food was good, but way over-priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-13,,,,,
