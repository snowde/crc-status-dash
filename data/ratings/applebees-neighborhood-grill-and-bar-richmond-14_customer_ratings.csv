10,Jared S.,"Richmond, KY",3,22,6.0,2.0,2013-08-22,Food was slow coming out and there were only about 6 tables filled at the restaurant. Took 20 minutes to pay my bill cause the staff went to the back to learn about a promo instead of taking care of their customers. Probably will only come back if I'm dragged back in,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
8,Ralph R.,"Salem, OR",1,50,,1.0,2014-04-29,"This has to be the worst applebee's I have ever been too.  I am a business traveler, and while I don't go to the whole applebee's/chili's/red lobster type places very often, I usually can expect average food and cold beer if I do happen to drop in.  this location however..  First off, it is DIRTY.  the tables and chairs were sticky.  The wait staff would have to be dead to show any less enthusiam for thier job.  We ordered an appetizer and the waiter brought out a place that was so obviously dirty that we were SHOCKED HE DID NOT NOTICE IT!!!  Then when brought to his attention it was an.. ok... hmmm..  ok.. sort of reaction.  Note.. that is why you got an insulting tip.. we were not cheap, we were offended by your service.  there were no paper towels in the bathrooms and the whole place had a smell about it.  Avoid at all costs",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
7,Elisha R.,"Berea, KY",0,21,,2.0,2014-10-05,I've only ate here a couple of times in the actual dining area and there was nothing really special about the service or the food.  Sometimes get take out from this place and it always seems to take forever to come out and have end had to walk in before to get the food instead of them coming out to deliver it to your car like there suppose to. Food is usually burnt or something is missing and for that reason we almost eat there anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
9,Steven H.,"Richmond, KY",20,4,5.0,1.0,2015-09-29,"Upon being sat was told my toddler would eat for free. When the check came they billed us for him. The waiter said, ""oh, the hostess was mistaken, but there is nothing I can do about it now"". My drink was empty more that it had soda in it. The place was very dirty, with the floors and tables ""sticky"". My wife's salad was much smaller than normal, which we figured was for the ""lunch price"", but it was billed at the full dinner price. We ordered a half price appetizer at the suggestion of the waiter, but he returned 20 minutes later to tell us that app was not offered. My burger came with free refills on fries, well even on the initial plate there was about 20-25 fries. It took them about 15-20 minutes to bring me a refill of maybe 15 more fries. They may be unlimited, but it would take half a day to get the equivalent of a regular order at any other restaurant.  Seriously the worst service I have had in a very long time. We paid $40 for lunch and left hungry and thirsty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
6,Christy B.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,,1.0,2016-07-03,"I didn't have high hopes for the Applebee's to begin with, but had to go there for a family member's birthday.  We waited over an hour for our food.  My drink sat empty for over an hour and a half without the waitress taking any notice to get me a refill.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
3,Whitney J.,"Richmond, KY",25,8,,4.0,2016-10-25,"Phenomenal service! It was a little slow especially for how late it was, but our waitress did an amazing job. She was in top of refills and even had my fries returned for fresher ones. The drinks were also exceptional; the blackberry long island ice tea is delicious. This is a really nice place for late night dining. We will definitely return on a later date and hopefully have the same waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
5,Russ P.,"Richmond, KY",0,23,5.0,1.0,2016-11-06,A tablet to order on? Really??? have we became this lazy. Guess I'll just walk to the kitchen and grab my food too. Oh what you want a 30% tip for just carrying my food from the kitchen to me. I'll just go somewhere else. Horrible. And yes I normally do tip 30-50% but not for ordering on a tablet. McDonald's has a better ordering experience. And their in shock when I tip 30%.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
2,C W.,"Richmond, KY",28,140,83.0,2.0,2016-11-09,"To start off, the customer service is bad, the food is bad, but the pricing is average. You can order on a tablet thing, which seems to be getting popular in restaurants these days. Yes, I would say their food has gotton somewhat better, but not to make me come back often. I only come here usually for invites and when I have to. The parking lot size is decent, and the location is good. Overall, I would not recommend Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
1,Robert J.,"Ontario, CA",1,70,51.0,4.0,2016-12-03,"Ok experience,12oz sirloin they got the side's mixed up, but that was quickly taken care of. Server, was very nice and attentive. All in all, good food, great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
4,Marjorie M.,"Gantt, AL",0,25,9.0,4.0,2016-12-03,Had a party of six. They happily put 2 tables together for us instead of making us cram in a large booth. Quick to take our drinks orders and appetizer order. Server was very nice. Food and drinks were in an appropriate amount of time. Everyone liked there food. All that had steaks commented on how well they tasted and tender. Overall it was a great meal and evening.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
0,Charlotte S.,"Burlington, KY",14,5,18.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"Although I have been to various other Applebees across the country, I have never been to this location. As soon as my party of three walked in we were immediately seated, and ordered our drinks and appetizers. The waitress then gave us a few minutes before she came back to ask for our main meal order. I opted for the sirloin with broccoli and French fries. The chips and salsa we ordered came out very speedy. The taste of the tortilla chips and the salsa felt very good in my tummy. After we demolished the chips two of our three orders came out to the table. The waitress who brought out our food said that the other dish would come out in only a few seconds. About 5 minutes later the salad that my grandmother ordered was brought to our table. Was not a fan of how long they made us wait for another dish, all of the food should have been brought out all together. Nonetheless my party and I quickly began to eat our meals. I first picked up a spoonful of broccoli into my mouth. The broccoli was too buttery for my preference, but I was not going to waste the food. Then I took a bite of my medium rare steak. I felt as if I was chewing on a brick, it was that hard. The fries were the only food that stood out to me in my meal. They were finely salted with a garlic seasoning that had me yearning for more. It was prepared so nicely that I did not even think of adding ketchup to them. This location of Applebee's definitely has its highs and lows. Overall, it is a mediocre restaurant that I would not come back to for a few more months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-14,,,,,
