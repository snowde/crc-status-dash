0,A K B.,"Penfield, NY",0,2,,1.0,2012-06-14,"The. Worst. Experience. In. A. Restaurant. --- EVER. Food did not come as requested. Took 20 minutes for it to come back, while the rest of the group had in the meantime, already finished their meal. When we asked our waiter to check on the meal which had to be sent back, we saw him (for 20 mins!) helping the tables around us but never once came to us to say it would be out shortly. He also never brought our new drinks over and to add insult to injury, they charged us twice for the meal which had to be sent back.  I had ordered the chicken wings (""the best wings around"") but they were over-sauced and so crispy hard that the meat was difficult to find. Did I get any hand-wipes, a usual expectation with wings? Nope. Had to ask for them after the bill was already brought. The waiter was a very nice guy, but should get more training. We felt very abused - not even was one drink free offered for all what we went through.  Will never go to another Applebees again - I'm sure the feeling is now mutual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24?start=20,,,,,
19,Mike M.,"Rochester, NY",39,126,98.0,1.0,2013-02-17,"This place totally up holds everything that chain restaurants represent. Poor management, poor food, poor service. We went here Friday night for my fathers birthday, not too long a wait considering we had a party of 7 people.  The primary reason we went to Applebee's was because they have a weight watchers menu and sever people in the group had points to count or however that works. Our waitress started off nice enough but the service went down hill quickly. Food was brought out  after about 15/20 minutes, except that 3 out of 7 dishes were wrong in some way and only 1 person was really happy with their food. I had gotten the sauce of my dish on the side, they forgot it but said it would be right out. No big deal, except it took 3 more request including speaking with a manager and about another 20 minutes to get said sauce. The two fish fries were over battered but the people ate them anyway and both steaks that were ordered came out wrong. My mother didn't care but my sister had to wait over 20 minutes to get the correct steak. The manager who came over didn't care, didn't apologize, the server half heatedly offered half off a dessert for the 7 of us lol. We just were eager to leave, skip this place over and keep your money local people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
12,Katy S.,"Rochester, NY",47,101,163.0,3.0,2014-07-02,"Came here with a friend at around 8 on a Tuesday night, it wasn't crowded but there were a few people there. We were seated right away, and our waitress came over rather quickly. They had gotten their new tablet system in that day, which I guess was pretty cool. With it you're able to order appetizers and desserts and also drink refills. Why you can't order an actual meal on it is beyond me. There's also a call button for the waitress, and if you're using a credit card you can pay using the tablet. Oh yeah, there's also the option to play games on it, but it costs 99 cents to unlock them.  Our orders were taken pretty quickly, but it seemed to take forever to get our food. The restaurant itself was freezing, to the point where I had to run it to the car to get a hoody. The staff seemed bored, and a lot of them were just hanging around. Our waitress seemed pretty disinterested with the whole thing. I get that it's slow, but at least make the customers you do have think you care.  Our food was hot and tasted good though, which is what really matters when it comes to dinner I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
11,Rudolph B.,"Rochester, NY",69,77,24.0,3.0,2014-07-06,Came here for a special pancake breakfast event with the RH girls youth soccer teams.  The service was done by the girls so I can't rate that for the restaurant but the pancakes were delicious!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
15,Jason B.,"Honeoye Falls, NY",0,19,1.0,1.0,2015-01-17,"Went to Applebee's tonight (Saturday 1/17) at about 5:30pm with family & friends and were told 25 minutes wait time, which is not unusual for a Saturday night.  However, we waited 45 minutes and were told at that time that the wait would be an additional hour to be seated. People that were waiting were leaving as fast as customers were coming in the door. The hostess stated the issue was the kitchen and that it was severely backed up She actually started referring customers to other local restaurants. This experience totally ruined our evening!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
16,Joshua J.,"Rochester, NY",11,28,3.0,4.0,2015-02-03,This time I had a better experience.  Our server was very busy but did a great job. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted great. The table of 16 next to us was slightly annoying but it is a restaurant... it happens. I will stop by again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
13,Naitik G.,"Rochester, NY",138,171,66.0,1.0,2015-02-20,"Let me just first clarify that this review is based on the experience I had at this particular franchise.  Firstly - they sat us in a section where the waitress was on a break. Understandable and we overlooked that part despite waiting for 10 mins for a water to be served. It was a rather busy night and the restaurant looked pretty packed. Secondly - When the waitress came back, she looked in a rather disgruntled mood, which carried over to our service. Now me being a vegetarian, I couldn't find a single thing on the menu for myself except the normal Caesar's salad. That's okay. My problem arose when this ill-mannered, pissed off waitress just dismissed me when I asked if there was anything at all that was vegetarian apart from the salad. Now I do not know how things usually work at Applebees, but for me, as a customer a restaurant is only as good as the service they provide and how good they are at accommodating a customer's request. Mind you, I did not lose my cool or was even the slightest bit angry. I just calmly asked, ""Can the chef put together a sandwich maybe? Just lettuce, onion, tomato would be fine."" The waitress, being in a bad mood, lost HER cool and passive-aggressively said, ""Sorry we do not substitute."" We calmly asked for the check for the one soda we'd ordered and left. Poor service, poor staff and the worst kind of customer service I've ever experienced.  I'm a pretty easy going guy and I would've even ordered the salad (knowing very well the limitations of my diet choice) but the fact that they even refused to put together a simple sandwich for me just made me unhappy as a customer.  The 1 star is also a little much for me, but I can't go lower.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
5,Lea B.,"Rochester, NY",342,356,4291.0,3.0,2015-06-24,Nathan was a FANTASTIC server!!!! Ordered the lunch 1/2 and 1/2 special at 12pm. Enjoyed the fiesta chopped chicken salad and shrimp pasta dish. Unfortunately the food took FOREVER to come out.  We didn't leave till 1:30... So much for an hour lunch break.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
6,Kelly S.,"West Henrietta, NY",382,501,4516.0,3.0,2015-06-24,"Wedge salad is really good, but it would be better if it was added as a regular salad not as a side.   Service was slow, but entertaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
17,Abby A.,"Henrietta, NY",46,6,3.0,1.0,2015-09-04,The service here is awful. The food is mediocre and will probably come to you wrong and about an hour after you oder it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,

10,Megan S.,"Waterloo, NY",41,17,8.0,1.0,2016-01-30,"I felt terrible for my waitress. She was absolutely trying her best to do her job. The manager who was standing around the bar area most of the night didn't lift a finger to help the poor lady. Not once did he come ask our large party and ask how  our meal was and the kitchen service was disgraceful .we got cold artichoke dip and the bowl was half empty. I asked them to warm it up , they microwaved it and brought it out 15 mins later. We were there 2 1/2 hours . they had no clue what they were doing in that place. My friend ordered a meal and had to ask for more of the red potato because they only served her 4 pieces . Not to mention we didn't get plates for our appetizers and it took a long time to get them or anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
7,Nicole M.,"Rochester, NY",227,339,1211.0,2.0,2016-01-31,"Applebee's... What do you expect, it's a chain. We sat at the bar because I didn't want to get sat next to some loud mouthed middle aged woman that rambled on about her day like Teresa Caputo on Long Island Medium. The bartender took good care of us. Appetizer came out 2 minutes before the entrées. We rolled with it. The Mac and cheese with chicken tenders wasn't anything special, but that's okay. If you are ordering from the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 you can mix and match items for $22.50. Happy hour is 3-6 Monday-Friday. Half prized appetizers and select beverages after 9pm in the bar area. If you have a large party, you can call ahead, but they do not take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
14,John D.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-03,I called in curbside to go. I arrived and waited outside in my vehicle for my food. I was on my phone and did not realize how long I had been waiting. I went inside to find out where was my food. I was informed that they had no one running curbside today and I had to go to the bar and get my food. I went to the bar and informed the bartender why I was there. She informed me that there cameras do not work so customers have to come inside to get there food. This is unacceptable. How am I or customers suppose to know that they must come inside?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
9,Lauren U.,"Long Beach, NY",230,4,,1.0,2016-12-04,"I have worked for over 10 years in customer service retail and restaurant business and I'd NEVER write a bad yelp review out of pure respect and code of brother/sisterhood in the service industry no matter the level of service but I can not hold this one in. This was the absolute worst experience I have had in a restaurant in general in my life. I am normally indecisive when I order and I do my best to be the least annoying I can but the waiter/bartender was rude and unprofessional. He told me he doesn't mind me being indecisive as long as I'm ""not a bitch."" I ordered the sampler platter that's comes with a chicken quesadilla mozzarella sticks and wings. I CLEARLY told the waiter that I am a VEGETARIAN. All I asked for was to sub out the wings for more mozzarella sticks and leave the chicken out of my quesadilla. He told me no problem. When I get my food I begin to eat the mozzarella sticks and as I begin to eat my quesadilla, after 2 bites I realize it is filled with chicken that I had already eaten. I rush to the bathroom and throw up. I eat this way due to ethical issues and I understand people make mistakes but this has completely turned me off of this foodchain. What a completely careless thing to do. I can not tell you how disgusted and angry I am. Shame on this restaurant for being so very careless. You do not deserve even the one star I gave you here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
8,Sean T.,"Webster, NY",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-26,"The absolute worst service I have ever had. Waited over an hr for dinner and when we received it, it was cold and raw.

4,Amy L.,"Rochester, NY",85,298,1012.0,1.0,2017-04-10,"I have only written 2 other 1 star reviews, but its truly deserved. One might ask and I feel this way myself - Why have you been so many times if you have had so many bad experiences? Over the Christmas season we always buy a bunch of Delta Sonic packages because they have excellent deals that include a $20 Applebee's certificate. Often we give the Applebee's certificates away but this year we thought we would keep a few as we live near-by and thought the Carside to-go would make for an easy dinner option.   We did the Carside to-go about 4 times between Feb and March this year and only one time was our meal ready at the time quoted. 10-20 minutes we waited over the time given. Only one order was correct and how we ordered it. They have forgotten salad dressings completely, left off major portions of salads ie: Thai sauce on a Thai chicken salad missing, Put mayo on sandwich when asked for it off, french fries given instead of onion rings that we paid an up-charge for and one salad that was literally half the size it should've been. Online ordering isn't user friendly as it has minimal options to customize, you would have to type in comments or call to order if you want options not listed. Although customization and even their general way of making items will likely be wrong when you get your order. Online ordering also doesn't always have newer items listed to order online. They added a Nashville chicken sandwich to the menu which I was really excited about but the chicken was really dry, overcooked and had minimal hot sauce on it. The only positives I could think of were when I actually got the onion rings I ordered they were super crispy/excellent. My husband also liked the flavors in the Southwest steak salad.  Overall poor meal option vs location and Carside to-go not great or convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
2,Am S.,"Scottsville, NY",12,7,,1.0,2017-08-15,"This location has had issues for a while. Decided to give it another chance since we haven't been there in over a year. Regret, regret, regret. Should have known from the start when we had to interrupt the hostess at the bar to be seated. Waitress was nice but a little rough around the edges trying to crack jokes that weren't really funny.  Ordered off the 2/$20 selection. Boneless wings were hard like they had been refried and the sauce was burying some while others had none. But it came with celery, 3 tiny pieces. My pasta came out in a piping hot bowl but the pasta was cold, there was hardly any cheese sauce, and what sauce there was seemed to be watered down from pasta water. The burger had been ordered ""no pink"" but I didn't realize that meant hockey puck.  If you're craving applebees.....make the trip to the Gates location. It's so much better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
3,Jennifer O.,"Greece, NY",78,148,1633.0,4.0,2017-10-31,"I'm rarely out in Henrietta to eat and if I am, Applebees isn't usually on my may of where to go.  I've been to Applebees tons of times In my life and I like to try new places or satisfy my Indian cravings when I'm out this way.  But they have  lunch specials for a good price.  I got a half a oriental chicken salad and a bowl of French onion soup for 10$ total. Our waitress was really nice and patient with us because my friends and i were catching up and not paying attention to the menu for a while.  She was attentive and was a great server.  You can get bad service or food anywhere. I did see some pictures of their takeout food and I would probably stay away from that, but my experiences there have been fine",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
1,Hope W.,"Avon, NY",5,76,354.0,2.0,2017-12-02,"I dont no where to begin... Ill start by flat out saying dont eat here... Long day at the mall didnt really want to eat there so hopped over to Applebee's. Wrong choice. I  knew it was going to be a little wait, its saturday night and packed, totally understand. After sitting for less then 5 minutes Me and two others were seated.  Drinks immediately came out after ordering.  I had a toddler with me and had to ask for a booster seat three separate times before getting one. We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, 20 minutes later after two separate waitress's said they were checking on our food 10 minutes after that our food showed up. Mind you the party of 3 that got seated 5-7 minutes after us already had drinks and thier apps and thier food right as we got ours. Our mozz sticks still have not arrived at this point. After asking about our mozz sticks i get a few sorrys then our waitress left. After eating half way through our main courses  here comes our mozz sticks. We were told to many orders came in and a ton of orders went to the wrong tables. Not to be rude but I was pretty annoyed by that point that i didnt really want to hear excuses. The mozz sticks were the only thing that actually tasted good and  was hot and fresh. I ordered the caprese chicken. The chicken itself was good the potatoes  that the chicken was sitting on not so much. I clearly got the end of the bucket for mashed potatos,  half way eating I kept geting hard crunchy piece's. The one side of my plate just had a hard lump of potato's that clearly were burned to the pan that they scraped out and served to people anyway. The other meal that was ordered was a basket of French frys and bonless wings dipped in hot. Not only were they cold like the rest of our food but there was absolutely no sauce. The  very itty bitty sauce that was on them was very light and soaked in to the chicken while sitting in the kitchen for longer than it should have.   Again its a busy saturday night so I was expecting some delays and mishaps but what really made the night was seeing how awfully trained the staff was. The hostess was about the only one who was polite and new everything she needed to do. So many people just standing around or running in circles doing nothing. Through out us sitting there multiple plates of food showed up at our table for servers to be completely confused as to why we already had our food. Even one server said I'm assuming this isnt yours she then went to three other tables asked the same thing before finding the rightful owner. It became more aggravating as the night went on.  Probably won't ever go back tonight completely killed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-24,,,,,
