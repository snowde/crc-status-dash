15,D J.,"Rockford, IL",0,34,,1.0,2012-09-30,"I used to eat here a lot when they opened. The service took a nosedive with the food quality. They can't get a single order right, probably because of the deafening music and semi-stoned wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
11,Stacy S.,"Rockford, IL",223,15,4.0,1.0,2012-11-10,"I've been to Applebee's quite a few times for business lunches (not when I'm the one who gets to choose).  The service is ok at best, there's nothing on the menu that makes me think ""Oh!  I want that!""... it's all the same choices that you can get in any other chain place, it seems like everything is doused in salt or sauce, and there's never been anything that I had there that I considered a great meal.  Considering that Stone Eagle is just blocks down the street at about the same price range, go there instead and support a local restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
10,Kevin L.,"Edmond, OK",503,442,279.0,1.0,2013-05-10,"poor service, poorly put together food! this is what bothers me. chain restaurants are supposed to have consistent food (a reason why many people eat at them), but this place just looked sloppy. the food was cooked ""lazy"", i.e. the cheese isn't even mixed in on some of the dishes, not even spread out, just in a pile on the side! what is that?! avoid this place, go to a different applebees even",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
14,Mark S.,"Rockford, IL",0,6,,1.0,2013-07-30,"Food presentation is good but the taste is far below marginal, very bland, no flavor, just blahh, and not just one item but for everything.  The service is good, but nothing about the food will have us going back.  When we arrived the at 6pm restaurant was maybe 1/4 full, if you know Rockford it is near impossible to eat around that time.  I have a suspicion management knows there are issues.  Upon leaving a manager opened the door for us and said nothing except for ""have a nice day"".  The manner in which he did, purposely avoiding eye contact made us feel he did not want any dialog regarding the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
13,Mrs R.,"Rockford, IL",0,17,,5.0,2013-09-07,"Friendly staff, fast service, great food. We have been to this location before and have not ever had a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
8,Adele L.,"Huntsville, AL",6,133,102.0,5.0,2013-11-24,"Sunday night: 7 oz sirloin steak cooked perfectly (medium rare), lean, and tasted fresh. Baked potato fluffy, green beans and broccoli cooked al dente, coffee fresh, waitress friendly and helpful. Kudos to all the wait staff, but especially to Tiffany, because my husband is hard to accommodate with his diet. This is the best Applebee's I've ever been to (10+ across the country).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
5,Tyler R.,"Rockford, IL",1,29,13.0,3.0,2014-12-28,"I went to Applebee's because I received a gift card for the place for Christmas. I just wanted to go after 9 for some half priced appetizers, which is a pretty good deal. I had cheeseburger sliders and mozzarella sticks. The sliders weren't that hot and were bland. The mozzarella sticks were okay, but they could have had a bit more flavor. But the waitresses were very nice. Sorry for such a short review, but there's not much to say. The place is okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
4,Brian C.,"Rockford, IL",66,84,22.0,4.0,2015-03-17,"I don't usually write reviews for chains unless it is to say how miserable the experience was. But I needed to make an exception for this Applebee's. The food was standard Applebee's fare. What made this such a neat dining experience was our waitress. She was so wonderful with my kids. She had my son blushing and chatting with her, listened to my 11 year old daughter talk about her Instagram, and was the same way with the kids at the other tables. She wasn't just serving the tables and filling drinks- she was chatting it up with all the elementary schoolers in the place. It was so much fun. I wish I could remember her name.  Why 4 stars for a nice waitress? She made the kids genuinely smile and laugh and have fun. Not a huge fan of Applebee's but definitely a fan of that waitress and seeing my kids smile! So 4 stars it is!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
9,Rosie T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,12.0,5.0,2015-04-29,"Everytime i think of a frozen strawberry margarita and appetizers, this is the place i go to. Service is excelent, and applebees has really stepped up with their new bar appetizers and dishes. Its a really good place to catch up with friends and have a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
6,Swampy J.,"Rockford, IL",0,31,1.0,2.0,2015-05-30,"Many chains have come and gone through the years,  but the Bee still stands. And that's what confuses me. To me they are the definition of average. They are consistently average. Never really bad, not never really great. The menu seems to get rotated, but I swear it's pretty much the same standard fare they have served for years. The type of stuff they can heat up in the microwave, nothing fancy. For the most part this location is usually clean and orderly. And the service is usually decent and attentive.  In the end I sum Applebee's up like this, after a long day of shopping or working, it's 6 pm, you want a quick bite to eat with no wait for a seat, you hit Applebees. If going out to eat is a big part if the evening, the place don't get brought up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
7,James J.,"Rockford, IL",3,2,,2.0,2015-07-17,"I rarely write reviews. I decided to make an exception. Our experience wasn't totally horrible, just mostly bad. First, the air conditioning was set to a very high level. It had be close to 80 degrees in there. Second, our waitress had almost no personality, and was just barely friendly. She did not speak very loudly or clearly. She never smiled .  The kitchen staff  was very loud vocally . So when I waitress  barely projected over her lips  it was very difficult to hear her. Even my wife said something about it, so it wasn't just me. The menu is not very enticing, and is over complicated for such a small menu. The food just did not look appetizing even though we were both hungry.  My wife ate a nacho appetizer as her main course. She said it was quite good. I had something called the cowboy burger. It was on a small band that was stacked very high with a lot of stuff that had nothing to do with hamburger. It had the burger, cheese, tomato, onions, pickles, bacon, again fried onion strings, and about a half a gallon of barbecue sauce. Oh, did I mention a mound of iceberg lettuce the size of a softball? Not only did it make it impossible to eat, when you tried to bite it, tge whole sandwich  disintegrated. I did the best I could, but I practically had to take a shower after the meal. I said something to our waitress who brought extra napkins. My wife asked for moist towelettes, and the waitress said, ""Sure we have those."" She was very disinterested and inattentive. The burger was really not very good, on top of the fact that it was the messiest burger I've ever had in my 55 years. The place was virtually empty, yet we never saw anyone that appeared to be a manager. The only reason we went there in the first place, was because we had a gift card. I think it will be our last trip to Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
3,Mark R.,"Rockford, IL",0,12,,5.0,2017-03-12,This is my family's go to place.  Service is good and food is good.  Any problems we ever had and the manager is always quick to help resolve the problem.  Very easy to work with if needed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
2,Frell 6.,"Mount Morris, IL",0,12,7.0,3.0,2017-05-23,Food was good. Service was ok. It was not crowded.  The drink I ordered could have use some more whiskey.  This place was just ok. Recommend it only if you have no other options where you want to be served food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
1,Joe C.,"Rockford, IL",8,50,,1.0,2018-01-06,"My wife and I took my father-in-law out to dinner tonight and probably (ok, definitely ) won't be back to this establishment again. We were seated quickly and our server, JS, came over approximately 10 minutes later and got our drink order. When she delivered those, she took our food order. The food took over 20 minutes to come to the table and she never checked back to us on our empty drinks. Finally she comes over and I ask for a new drink and pointed to my wife's also and after waiting 10 minutes she brought mine only. My wife had to ask for hers and another 10 minutes. Then my father-in-law had to ask for his water refilled. She kept calling us ""hon"" and when she finally brought the check, we had had enough of the waiting, and she made us wait another 10 minutes before bringing the receipt. This Applebees used to be pretty good, but it now seems a little dirty (carpet, tables) and unkept. The poor  single bartender seemed overworked and was sweating enough to having to wipe her forehead quite often while mixing drinks. I think their time has come and gone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
0,Casey C.,"Lawrenceburg, IN",2,59,13.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"Staff is friendly and our waitress (Cassie) was pretty good. Food is OK for the money, and the 2 for $20 menu is budget friendly. Every surface I came into contact with at this location seemed sticky. It could definitely use better and more consistent cleaning!  Bottom-line... OK I'm a pinch, but would be my 1st choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rockford-8,,,,,
