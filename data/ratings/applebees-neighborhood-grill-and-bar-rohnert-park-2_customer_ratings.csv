69,Summer B.,"La Grange, CA",9,6,11.0,3.0,2012-01-11,"Great place for a cheap priced meal and the food isn't to shabby but i wouldn't order steak there ever again cause i feel that beef should taste like beef and it tasted more like pork to me. Plus, medium rare turns out to be more on the well done side and that's been more than once. I'm a firm believer in giving more than one chance cause it could always just be an off day and serving people can be a difficult job. The service is usually great but sometimes not so much when it comes to the greeters. Its a decent enough place and i love the 2 for 20 deals but if you're looking for high class this isn't in your destination plans. Its good for kicking back and not worrying about spending an arm and a leg for not great but decent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=60,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

1,Kira W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",91,104,28.0,2.0,2012-08-18,"I think our bartender was hungover but the service was just plain frustrating today. We were starving after dealing with consumer hell in Rohnert Park and desperately needed quick nourishment to keep going (and a beer to wash it down with). Our bartender was very out of it. He was about to take our food order when the phone rang - so he took the phone call while we waited. After the phone call he ignored us for about five minutes (we were sitting right in front of his computer terminal). We kept trying to catch his eye to remind him that we never got to place our order. I finally piped up and said, ""We're ready to place our food order,"" but he was too busy talking to the manager about some shift switch to hear me. My husband finally got his attention and we were finally able to place our order - but I think there was some palpable tension after that. I felt like we were suddenly ""rude customers"" or something. Before we sat down, there were a few items leftover from the people before us. The bartender had grabbed the glassware but never cleaned the bar area so I was sitting at someone else's sticky mess. My husband had to ask the bartender to clean up the mess so I could eat in a clean environment. I've been served by this bartender before and it was okay - which makes me think he was out of it - but Hubs and I were already on edge with the shopping hell and the service was pretty vacant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=40,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

We waited and when she seemed to be staying at her little desk thing I made a point to make contact, smile and say hello. She said 'hi' and then turned around and wandered across the restaurant where she got silverware and seated the family. She then began gathering menus and sort of... doing I don't know what? Nothing? I've never been ignored like that- it was just bizarre! My husband and I just stood there, wondering what to do. About a minute later some guy came up and sat us.  The food was not memorable (our own fault- it's Applebees) After waiting for new sodas for our whole meal we ended up requesting our check and then our waiter brought us soda refills... and then some other guy brought us two sodas. 4 late sodas.

They do not follow the food that is on their menu. The first time I received a burger without onions on it and was told that it did not come that way yet both the picture in the menu and other applebees have always made it like this. This happened again yesterday when I ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to come with pico de gallo. Both my friend and I ordered the same thing and neither of us had pica de gallo on our chicken. It was also covered in some kind of a mayonaise like sauce.

49,Melissa H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",37,94,8.0,3.0,2014-10-13,"I wouldn't usually review a chain restaurant because you pretty much should know what to expect and what type of food and service you will receive but I had a really weird experience with our bartender Saturday night. We came in at 10:45, this is an hour and 15 minutes before they close. We opted to sit at the bar and the bartender could not make it anymore obvious that she was really irritated with anybody who dared show up and order something. I understand she may have been having a bad day and being a bartender is not an easy job but you have to be a little less obvious because it's not the customer's fault that you hate your job or things are a little rough. I've worked in food service and been there before, exhausted and working at a fast food restaurant at 2AM and rushing to get everything done and cleaned so I could just go home but I never treated my customers crappy as much as my job sucked. Don't treat your customer like a huge inconvenience because your customers are your wage and tip. What felt the most awkward to me was being treated as if I had come in 10 minutes before closing (we came in over an hour before closing!). I can understand why bartenders and waitresses would feel overwhelmed with having customers arrive 10 minutes before closing and expecting to have 5 star service when the employees just want to get everything done to go home on time.  To the manager, your bartender needs a little more coaching on good customer service.

Took avenges some of their creative drinks, enjoyed the Company, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the most inexpensive piece of beef I've ever ordered in a restaurant. Sadly, as soon as additional arrived I realize that it was not a deal but tit for tat. Probably the smallest piece of fillet that I have ever seen, with out any substantial sauce.

I have only been to an Applebee's maybe once about a decade ago, but my husband got a gift card here so we had to use it. I looked up the reviews here to get some recommendations and saw everyone just hated it here! So I was expecting crap food and horrible service but I got the opposite. I walked in on a fairly busy Saturday night and was immediately greeted at the door by a friendly host. I told them I was looking to order something to take home and they gave me a menu to look at and a few minutes later a friendly girl named Caty came over. She was really patient and gave me great recommendations. I told her I had a $25 gift card and with her help I got out of there for $25.54, perfect :) As I waited, I was asked at least 3 times if I had been helped yet by obviously busy waiters who just happened to see me on their way to the kitchen, but they took the time to stop and make sure I was taken care of. There were quite a few people running around. I saw many waiters checking in on guests at tables to make sure everything was alright, all of this completely contrary to what other reviews on here have said. Granted, I did not stay in and dine at a table, but there isn't a whole lot to do while waiting for food so I just people watched and saw all around great service. Caty was especially friendly and attentive. I didn't wait too long for the food and when I got home and ate it with my husband we were both pretty happy with it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest food in creation but it's pretty damn decent. I'm especially a fan of their many options of flavored ice teas that don't seem to be sweetened very much, if at all. Perfect for someone like myself who doesn't drink soda and tries to stay away from overly sweetened drinks. And all the beverages were only $0.99. The only negative thing I could possibly say is that they have a special to go entrance that I parked in front of, but the door said ""use other entrance,"" so I walked all the way around to the front only to be told that I should have in fact gone in through the to go door. Pretty silly but now I know. I didn't mean to write so much, and I don't super love the place, but it really doesn't deserve some of these other reviews so I just rambled on sorry xD",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.352,2.12

Our food was disgusting. It was actually inedible, probably the worse restaurant food I've ever had. I ordered their four cheese Mac n cheese with honey barbecue chicken tenders on top. The pasta was very overcooked and mushy, the sauce didn't taste even slightly cheesy and was just kind of slimy and the chicken was over cooked and tasted like it was just coated in honey. My son wouldn't even eat the kiddie Mac n cheese I got for him, and my husband's meal was just as disappointing. He tried to eat as much as he could but left about half his plate, and I left almost a full plate because of how horrible it was.

She not only keeps us coming back as often as we do. But with this $1 margarita promotion/fiasco she kept her cool and made sure we had everything we needed and that we were happy as could be the whole time we were there.  Now, the reason it's NOT a 5 star review and it's only 1 is because the manager last night, Socorro, did not do anything to make our experience better or worth coming back in all honesty. 1 her attempt of helping was more damaging then if she had not even tried..because she started to confuse everybody else and then makes their jobs harder. 2 my arm had hit my margarita glass and the 1/4 of the drink that was left in the glass had spilt on the counter top. (Oops!) She stood there and watched me while I was cleaning it up with one white little napkin... until I rose my arm and asked her if she could assist me by getting me more napkins, sense she was just standing and leaning on the bar spacing out doing nothing while EVERYONE ELSE was bussing there butts! She then wiped it down, but didnt even offer to grab me another drink! I also want to be very clear, I WAS NOT trying to get anything for free... but an offer to get a paying customer at THE BAR for another drink would have only made sense right?  Side note: Socorro turned down a group of people who wanted to order about 10 shots of patron..... she also made them feel like they were being the problem by asking for that quantity of shots.. even though they were a big group. You could tell the one woman talking to her seemed very offended and confused. now that's just blowing off business and loosing money... Now, back to when we first arrived. She wrote our names down, my boyfriend and myself, then walked away. After waiting about 20 minutes (which we had no issue with the wait. It was crazy busy. We get it.) BUT THEN a group of 3 walked in and ends up knowing some employees there or maybe even worked there, but IMMEDIATELY got sat and skipped the wait that about 10 other parties were patiently and fairly waiting for.  I've been in the serving industry for almost 10 years, so I get that if a coworker or close friend that comes in and if you can possibly sneak them in and have them skip the wait, then do it. Depending on the circumstance. Let me just say this was NOT the right circumstance lol. & To do it in front of ALL the people waiting AND to do it after looking at the reservation sheet seeing me and my boyfriends name next, but not knowing or seeing our party size (2) is not okay. Due to Socorro not doing her job..I politely approached the host after my boyfriend walked out and told the host to take us off the list and brought it to her attention how I noticed she allowed her friend/coworker to sit first... she was apologetic asked for my name and saw my name was next but didn't know the party size, but immediately said she could seat us right away. which all comes back to Socorro not doing her job effectively and writing down that one detail.  Not to mention while I was waiting to speak with the other manager on the floor that night, I over heard multiple servers complaining about Socorro being more of a hassle then helpful. I was informed she was new to FOH managing and usually manages in the back of house. But from the experience I had last night with her ""running"" things and being in charge and ""trying"" to help may not be a good fit and didn't allow us to have our usual great/smoothly ran experience.  We love Carolyn and Jason! Those two are the reason we will continue to come and give our business! So make sure to give them a huge high five from the both of us!  I usually never take the time out of my day to write this long of a feedback or any feedback in general whether it be good or bad. But in this case, it needed to be communicated. And it's also about time I give my two fav Applebee's employees a great shoutout! GO JASON AND CAROLYN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
22,Mark H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-12,"I NEVER write Yelp reviews so you can believe me when I say this is the worst place I have ever been served at. It's sad to see that in times like these, where one's home has been destroyed and all we need is a place to eat, that there are people like Socorro R running this place that refuse to serve a meal. I'm appalled and disappointed that THIS is the only Applebees that people can now go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
