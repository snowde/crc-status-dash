I visited there last week and upon walking in there was a girl opening the door for the customers but no one at the desk to seat us. We ended up waiting for 10 minutes and then the host showed up, didn't ask who was first in line but decided to seat a party of 22 before my party of 2.

We sat at the bar while our party of 11 waited to be seated and the bartender told us she'd send our next round of drinks to the table, since our name had been called. She never ended up telling our waitress, so we waited double as long for our drinks.  Secondly, they put a family with a highchair extension right behind our enormous already-seated party, so nobody on either side could get through, making it even worse for the servers.

They repeatedly push drinks and appetizers within seconds of being seated  .We simply ordered a dinner and was asked twice by 2 different staff about having appetizers , During our meal we were reminded about dessert now by our waiter and another waitress 2 different times .  The environment  summed up not a pleasurable food experience it is annoying although the staffs personality is friendly , The resturaunts mission seems to prey on people that dont like conflict , they assume that people will say yes to everything because they market their consumers as being weak ,People do not like confrontation so they will surrender by saying yes .   To eat here you must be stern and know what you want and just tell the server what you would like ignoring all their recommendations .  The desserts in a shot glass and charge 5+ dollars for them .Criminal   This is establishment is not for me . pushy environment .  Positive note / Food is decent resturaunt is clean .Plenty Parking is available . My recommendation to you (Applebees) Why not give people a small free sample of the drink your trying to push when people taste it 9 out of 10 will buy it .

42,Kirin J.,"South Ozone Park, NY",237,13,4.0,1.0,2013-02-26,"I guess I can't expect much from an Appleee's in general since it borders the line of quick serve. The food will always be exactly what you expect, regular american classics. Nothing special but my favorite entree is the grilled chicken penne and I love the brownie Sunday almost as much as I adore the CoronaRita (must try). This particular location only appeal is its location near the airport and their happy hour which includes half priced apps and 2 for 1 drinks. I think your experience here will always depend on your server. Today, my server Melissa B just happened to tip a balanced scale over to the negative side bc of her less than pleasant facial expressions and lack of appeciation for a cusomer who comes to order appetizers, entrees, dessert, and multiple drinks, and who generally tips 20% plus! Maybe my expectations are a little high bc of the fact tha the last 2 times I came here on the way to or from the airport, the server abslutely kissed my ass and did an outstanding job, but she was terrible, unapologetic, and unprofessional. She also refused to let me speak to the manager, messed up our drink orders, would not give me an itemized copy of the check (lied and said she could not print it), and did not ask if we wanted anything else, did not say thank you, did not apologize. Anyways, Applebee's has never been my favorite, but regular food and subpar service at this particular location makes me feel generous for giving them even 1 star (I have never given a 1 star before tonight). I would have stayed a while longer and ordered a few more drinks if this girls terrible attitude wasn't so distracting and neglectful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rosedale?start=60,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

35,Michael D.,"Concord, CA",163,33,2.0,1.0,2014-07-03,"Possibly the worst experience at any restaurant ever. Brenda our waitress was always nowhere to be found. She came by the table maybe three times, counting when she took our order. I usually always tip 20% to 30%, this was actually the first time I walked out with only tipping 5%, which covers what she would have to tip out to the busser, bar, and runner. We barely had our drinks refilled. Maybe waited like 15 minutes after they are empty to actually get a refill. Best part is, she gave me a refill, but my friend needed one too, but she just walked away after I got mine refilled before he could say anything. So he had to wait even longer because she was nowhere to be found. She barely even walked past the table. Oh and even better, it somehow took her forever to get the refills, even though we were sitting next to the bar!  When she did check on us, we were basically finished with everything. Of course the drinks were always empty whenever she came by.  The food was meh. Literally the only good thing there was the wings and onion rings. I tried my friends chicken quesadilla, and that tasted like it came from Taco Bell, seriously, maybe even worse than taco bells quesadilla. My other friend had the steak, he said it was alright, it looked dry and gross. I tried his side of broccoli though and that tasted like it was from the Costco down the block, it was still hard and cold like it needed to be defrosted. The riblets that I had, sucked, but I never liked Applebee's riblets, I don't even know why I ordered it lol. Maybe I was giving it another chance. I usually get the cowboy burger and love it. So yea, service sucked, and food sucked. I'm usually a nice person and always try to defend anything people have a problem with. Like if my friends have a problem with service, or food taking awhile I'll just say ""oh they are probably just busy"", but this was terrible. I've seen Brenda just talking to her co workers instead of helping us out when we needed her. I'm not complaining that she was talking to her coworkers though, I'm a server too, I know chatting it up with them makes it fun being at work.

Its a must try! Let me not forget our Waiter for the night, Rasheed! He was very delightful and attentive not forgetting his great customer service skills.

I try to see the good in everything HOWEVER my duty is to Yelp HONESTLY and help out others seeking clarification. Ok with that being said, this place is HORRIBLEEEE!!!  Hubby and I came to spend a little time together since we were already in the area (5 town). We decided to grab some drinks since it was about to be happy hour and also get something light to eat. Ok great! So we go in and there's no host so we walked over and sat at the bar. The bar tender who I believe was either a shift supervisor or a manager was taking orders. Nice lady but her being nice didn't prepare us for the horrendous food we had.  The food was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!! I provided pictures so as you can see there's no falsifying what I'm saying. The salad was completely brown and disgusting, the mash potatoes tasted like spoiled milk( also very DRY), the steak was super dry and the broccoli was stale. I'm not understanding how a big establishment such as Applebee's can serve such nonsense. It just isn't right.  You're better going to the Applebee's at Green Acres to be honest with you.

The host was incredibly rude, just going through the motions of his script.  Then... There's the food.  I have to say, the steak quesadilla was actually not bad, but outside of that I feel like I'm eating at McDonalds when I eat here. Stale flavorless food.  Wouldn't recommend.

At that point we talked and decided this sh@t-show was just going to continue as literally everything about this place took 5x as long as it should have and was delivered poorly and with attitude. So we found the waiter and told him to cancel the order- and he couldn't have cared less. So I guess good call on our part as I don't like to eat spit on my food... Overall, pretty freaking terrible.

49,Rich R.,"Woodmere, NY",0,7,,3.0,2017-05-01,"This particular location gets crowded often, so the long waits are not something I can blame the restaurant for. However the frequent order mix ups and forgetfulness of waiters (in terms of bringing out silverware and drinks) can be blamed on the staff.  But to be honest, the main gripe I have is with the corporate changes to the menu. Now I cannot say that certain changes weren't valid or efficient options for the chain but I can definitely voice my opinion.  The appetizers are where my issues lie. The green bean crispers, which were some of the best I've had in the area, have been toned down. The price remains the same while the quantity has been significantly cut and you get once sauce as opposed to the previous three. Even the seasonings have gone from elaborate combinations of spices to mostly salt. The wings have a similar issue. Same price yet lower quantity and less celery/carrots. At times, no dip was even provided (But that's on the staff).  The sweet potato fries are now a smaller order and fewer sauces are given.  Again, I cannot blame this specific location for these cutbacks, but I am irritated with the decisions that the heads of Applebee's have made.
