5,Mark D.,"Poultney, VT",1,31,89.0,5.0,2015-04-05,"We love it here. Yes we realize it's"" plastic food"" but for a quick meal of comfort food it can't be beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
8,Judy S.,"Northborough, MA",0,7,,1.0,2015-10-28,"Stopped here to pick up a lunch special to go.  Ordered the French Onion soup and the Thai salad and asked for some rolls or bread with it.  With tax, the bill came to almost $10.  Brought it back to my hotel room, took it out of the bag, and was shocked to see the minuscule amount of shrimp and forkful of iceberg lettuce.  I brought back to the restaurant to complain and spoke with Dawn, who I think was the manager.  She said this is the size of the salad, a small portion because it is a low calorie menu. Also, when I said there was no rolls or bread, she said, she thought I wanted more bread in the onion soup (are you kidding??)  At that point she said she would be glad to upgrade me to a full sized dinner salad.  I said that would be very nice thank you.  Much to my surprise, when she returned with my upgraded salad, she charged me more than $7, in addition to the almost $10 which I paid for the luncheon special.  Poor portions, and definitely poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
2,Jeanna G.,"Paramus, NJ",437,627,2801.0,5.0,2015-12-21,"Car side to go was excellent! Ordered my usual oriental chicken salad with fried chicken and an extra dressing along with some boneless wings for my boyfriend once he got off the mountain, everything was hot and fresh when I arrived to pick it up. I will definitely be coming back here for a quick and easy meal pick up !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
4,Jake B.,"Coney Island, Brooklyn, NY",0,30,2.0,1.0,2016-01-02,"Went twice to this place around 9pm, on 12-27-15 and 1-2-16, and it seems like they had two different chefs. The first time the food was great, but the second time the chef is clearly not qualified to cook, or is just fake, just like half of the food was. First with the same food we ordered the first time: boneless wings, and sizzling chicken and shrimp. While the chicken was grilled and had color brown lines, it was a bit drier to my liking, but I understand that's how a lot of restaurants make it. The boneless chicken were fully covered in the sauce we ordered, just like in the picture. I can't say the same for the second time, whatever of an idiot chef there was, he felt it necessary to burn the chicken twice, and barely put any sauce on the wings. We ordered Sriracha Shrimp, which are suppose to be Sriracha sauce, instead we received shrimp in sweet and spicy sauce, not hot at all. That is fake advertising. The steak we had for $18, was rubber, even at medium and it was red, just a cheap quality beef. The only good thing they make in this place is the seasoned fries. But overall, I wouldn't go to this place if you want to enjoy your meal and get what you ordered. Another thing about this place, and probably many other locations is the tablet, which is another way of ripping money off people without their permission. It is nice to have it to order and pay without waiting for waitress, but all those gimmicks that attracts kids is just bad, not to mention that there is no confirmation whatsoever if you want to pay for the game you are about to play, and no parental controls. My 4yr old daughter went to play a game and somewhere it mentioned that play games for $1.99. She did not get any confirmation. I made them take it off the bill, because they have no right to do that. I am surprised that there is no lawsuit yet, but one is definitely coming their way. Thanks for ruining my dinner Applebees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
0,Jim L.,"Framingham, MA",42,26,2.0,5.0,2016-02-19,Great service from Connie she was on top of her game clean station well fed with a perfectly done steak and onion rings to die for even heard when we were running out of ketchup!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
3,Jenna M.,"Canton, CT",1,16,6.0,1.0,2016-11-09,Horrible wait staff. Extremely strict on anything. Not willing to change of arrange anything on the menu or drinks. My friend was allergic to something and they made the meal with it after she asked not to. I eat at chain restaurants maybe once a year and this is why.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
1,Zachary C.,"Moore, OK",0,24,2.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"There is a reason YELP needs a no star review, you can even make it a coveted once a year privilege, this is the place for it... unorganized staff and absolutely ridiculous attitudes! To give someone a ""portion"" of their meal, after explaining to the waitress they would like it with their meal is ridiculous (no, I don't want the fries before my burger)... and then have to send it back, TWICE after receiving it 30 minutes later!!! The food was ok, WHEN COOKED PROPERLY! The intelligence of the staff is appalling, so appalling I would question the validity of their ability to spell ""restaurant"" correctly!!! I'm going to be very plain, if you are traveling through Rutland, and heading to the mountain, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!  Find another where you can actually get some sort of service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rutland-3,,,,,
