33,Landen Y.,"Savannah, GA",26,70,,2.0,2012-12-01,"Worst applebees experience ever.  our server was friendly enough, but he basically ignored us the entire time we were there.  we sat for ten minutes without a drink after our order was taken (this was at lunch) and we were about to leave when the appetizer we ordered came to the table. We ordered the pretzel sticks with cheese, which were amazing.  Kim had q bacon cheeseburger and i had a jalepeno chicken chop salad. The food was excellent but the service was among the worst I've ever experienced.  The manager came to our table and ended up comping some of our food, which is the only thing that kept this experience from ruining my afternoon.   We'll eat at applebees again, just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

We have dined in a couple of times and the food then was subpar. However, this time, we quickly realized that this experience was one for the ""Worst Ever"" record books.  My husband ordered the cheesy chicken penne and I ordered the 7 ounce steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. We got our food home and opened the containers to find dry, colorless food with an off-putting smell - yuck! We were both starving after a long day, so we choked down some of our meals and abandoned it.  The hilarious part was when the chicken bits left over from my husband's meal was discovered by my cat. He too wasn't too pleased with his portion of the meal. He grabbed a bit of my husband's leftover chicken, dropped it back on the plate shaking his head and hit it a few times with his paw. He then proceeded to pick it up again and ran away, at which time we presumed he was going to eat it. We then discovered the little scrap of chicken sticking out of his litter box slightly covered in litter! EVEN MY CAT WOULDN'T EAT THIS ""CRAP""!  Never never never again!

35,Stephen S.,"Savannah, GA",25,48,32.0,2.0,2013-10-09,"First and foremost I will admit I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan but came here with a group so had to go with the flow. Those prejudices have nothing to do with this review because those specifically deal with food quality which wasn't an issue.  What were the issues is unfortunately a long list. We were seated and the forgotten about for 15 minuets. Then the waitress comes to take our order and we remind her we haven't even received menus yet. A few of the guys ordered a popular beer they where out of. No big deal they ordered another kind.  15 minuets later she returms to take our food order. The lady does a great job of up selling the half price appetizers which may have been the only thing she did well all night.  Then the REAL wait starts. In between the 40 minuets of waiting for the food we had one guy ask for a diet cook refill 4 times before receiving it, the beers guys order another round be told they are now out of that brand too, and when the food does come they left off my order entirely. There was 8 people in our party not 20. There may have been 25 people on the place with most of the rest sitting at the bar. Fortunately, with the exception of my food coming out 20 minuets after everyone else's, no one had major complaints about the food itself.  Long story short this place did not do much in the way of making me turn the corner on chains and this place has to go through a lot of changes before I step foot in it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

34,Greg P.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,2,,1.0,2014-07-05,"Stopped in on the way to Sarasota because it is close to I-95. The restaurant is terrible.  When we entered we asked the hostess if we could have a booth. Her answer her was ""Well you know their all dirty now.""  And she proceeded to talk to the next guests and seat them. Restaurant was 1/3 full. Then a server came up to asked us to seat us and she said let me clean one off.  So we thought great.  We ordered fish and chips and a BLT sandwich. Dinner came out about 20 min later.  Not bad.  That was the end of the good experience. Bacon was hard as rock and old.  French Fries were cold and totally saturated with old burnt tasting grease.  I asked the waitress for some new hot fries and she brought them for desert 20 min later and the were the same fries just as cold.  I paid with a gift certificate and the waitress said it had been used before which it had not.  Showed her the $50 receipt that we paid for it.  She said the manager would take care of it this time.  Which leads me to believe I am supposed to have $32 balance .  I will be calling Applebee's corporate tomorrow to fix the problem.  Manager never came to the table.

They also put anyone with a small child on one side of the restaurant, and any patrons that are 60+ on the other side.

Waited 5 minutes inside front door with another couple to be seated and restaurant was empty (employees walking by, but looked like wait staff was in meeting in back corner). Out of Michelob Ultra draft listed as one of happy hour specials. Server was courteous and prompt. Ordered steak with roasted quinoa, tomatoes & spinach. Asked for Pittsburgh rare since they r advertising a new fire grill. Reply came back that they could not do that. When dish was served, looked just like it was dumped out of a frozen dinner tray after being microwaved. No visible tomato or spinach & gravy smears all around dish. Asked for manager and she came promptly. She apologized and told me she would prepare the dish correctly for me. When she returned with dish, it was so much more visibly appealing. I went on to order desert, churros with chocolate marshmallow dip. Mini marshmallows were not melted and I could not dip them. Asked server to please microwave. Took a few minutes. Did not ask for any discount. When check came, manager had credited entree on check & it was very much appreciated! I have usually chosen Applebee's because I have felt that I received more value and quality for my buck. In finally realizing that they r franchises, at one location a side salad is beautiful and covers bowl and at next location (Did I mention I work on the road & eat out 4 or 5 days a week?)  it covers half the bowl. In summary, (too late, right!) I am so happy to see Applebee's offering more healthy choices! However, they r deleting many of the reasons I go there, i.e. side salad at lower cost with an entree, hot bacon salad dressing and pretzel sticks with caramel sauce, and they change menu so often that staff training on preparation is not keeping pace!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8?start=20,,,,,

Bland, soulless food. My wife's chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese was depressing to look at. I could have made it better myself with some Kraft Mac and cheese and a few chicken strips from Popeyes. Looked like cafeteria food. My daughter's corn dog was still partially frozen in the center. When we requested a new one be brought out, it took well over 15 minutes. By the time it came out we had all finished eating and my daughter was full from sharing food off of our dishes.

Wouldn't recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

3,Shawn S.,"Savannah, GA",77,43,82.0,2.0,2017-06-25,"I dont even want to waste time writing a review about a chain place that just seems to be failing in every state that I have visited  one in. However because its in my blood i will at least write a little something to make the yelp machine happy lol. To sum it all up i 100% purely regret  going here for lunch. I mean applebees used to be a decent chain  but i guess due to the changing  generations  and our differences  in what we call service and quality, this chain is just ugh. Food all tasted the same Service was slow. Kitchen staff was slow.. my.great grandmother moved faster than these kids do. I csnt even type any more.. i trully think im done with applebees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

1,Roy S.,"Nokomis, FL",0,20,,1.0,2017-08-21,"Fist off, I do not like it when a bartender calls me ""baby"".  I'm old enough to be your grandfather....... I ordered a burger, medium with fries well done.  The burger came out medium well and dry as a bone.  Everything was just thrown on the plate.  Very appertizing...  When the bartender asked how everyone was, I just stated that it was OK.  Well, if looks could kill.  Hey, you asked. And speaking of staff, I have seen a better accumulation of people at a circus side show. You have one waitress that is the better part of 50 with blonde????hair hanging all the way to her butt.  Nice on a 20 year old, not so much on her.   Another with a blonde/brown boys haircut and a sleeve full of tats.  I have nothing against tats, but in a business/resteraunt atmosphere the company should make them wear long sleeves. And, the management staff looked like they have been eating Applebees food since they were three.  Nuff said....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

To our surprise we were stopped my the most sincere and apologetic manger, thus the 2 star rating.   Food mediocre, our new waitress tried really hard to please us the bitter taste remained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
5,Karen B.,"Savannah, GA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"Decided to give this location another try after being disappointed in the past by the awful service. Once again they failed. This location's staff could use some Customer Service training ASAP! The hostess made more effort trying to serve a party of ten in which only four of the guest were there, than trying to seat my party of two. Empty tables and booths everywhere. Two of the staffers looked at us and proceeded to walk into the kitchen.  Perfect location for an Secret Shopper or a visit from Corporate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
2,Mercedes P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",9,136,333.0,2.0,2018-01-02,"This place was awful. You truly cant judge a book by its cover, or a restaurant. Its nice, clean, and spacious inside. The service here sucks. The baked potatoes were sent out cold. The waitress offered to reheat it. Uhh definitely not. Refills had to be requested more than once without being filled. My Aunt specifically said she was allergic to Parmesan cheese and ordered the artichoke dip without it, and lucky her boyfriend noticed they put the Parmesan on it anyway. The chicken tenders for the kids were hard and dry. We ordered a to-go order with a sandwich and soup. We got a cold sandwich and the soup was missing. Good thing we checked the bag. The service was overall just poor and slow. My husband and I frequent the location in Lawrenceville, GA and have never had such a bad experience at Applebees. I completely see why this location has such a low rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-savannah-8,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
