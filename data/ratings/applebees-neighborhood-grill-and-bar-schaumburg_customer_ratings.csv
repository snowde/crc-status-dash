11,Sherill M.,"Dallas, TX",3,308,32.0,3.0,2012-05-06,"Applebees is nothing special.  I only go here for the toss salad with the delicious hot bacon vinegar dressing.  The salad is just typcial nothing special.  The only problem is its $11 for a tiny plain chicken salad.  I would return much more often if it wasnt so expensive.  I'm no cheap skate, but $11 for a toss salad is ridiculous; I only go for the dressing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-schaumburg,,,,,
0,Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,292.0,3.0,2012-06-21,"Oberweis was jammed packed and we weren't in a mood for the line so we decided to walk across the parking lot to Applebee's. My boyfriend ordered the Triple Chocolate Meltdown and I went for the Strawberry Cheesecake Dessert Shooter. Not only were the portions generous, the total with tip was less than what it normally costs us at Oberweis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-schaumburg,,,,,

1,Sir J.,"Schaumburg, IL",201,76,13.0,2.0,2013-02-23,"Prices suck for what it is. They don't serve pitchers.  We went in at 9 for half price appetizers, and in size 2 font on the ad it shows that apparently on Friday and Saturday it doesn't start till 10. So we decided whether or not paying $4 for a premixed Long Island ice tea was worth it, then decided we'd rather go across the street to Easy Street Pub. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because our waitress was really cool, and I think she wanted to be there even less than we did.  Don't bother going here unless you can get the half price appetizers which are actually worth it. I will admit that the boneless chicken wings are really good here. I just had a subpar experience with this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-schaumburg,,,,,
2,Krissy S.,"Hanover Park, IL",23,67,201.0,1.0,2013-07-11,"The food suck. The service sucks even more. This should be a NO star review. Came here with family and every staff member made us feel like we're bothering them whenever we needed their service. Everybody, I mean from the manager to the server was giving us cold treatment. No smiles, no hellos. Never gonna eat again at any applebees restaurant. And they obviously use frozen vegetables and protein for their food. Yuck. Why did we even think of eating on a chain restaurant like this, IDK. We must be out of our minds when we agreed on going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-schaumburg,,,,,
