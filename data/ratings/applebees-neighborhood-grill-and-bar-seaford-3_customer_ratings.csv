13,TT B.,"Rockville, MD",113,51,23.0,2.0,2014-04-01,"Ok place as Applebee's go, but the dishes were very dirty .. Yech !  The waitresses are too busy flirting to actually be attentive. I sat at bar and asked for an iced tea to go which bartender said she'd get after my meal, but never got it. The bar tender forgot me because she was so busy taking inventory of  their bottles!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
12,Jill E.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,67,13.0,1.0,2014-07-03,"Absolutely the worst meal I've had ever at a restaurant.    Steak was microwaved.   Veggies were watery n cooked for days.   Mashed potatoes were tasteless.     After 1 bite the gal took it back n called a manager who came to the table saying ""I hear you complained?""   I laughed in his face n said ""so much for customer service but seriously that was the worst steak I've ever tasted.   Go look at it and come back and tell me that's what's on the menu and what you are to serve.  It was microwaved"".   He said ""I'll take it off your bill"" and never came back.   Gals at front door giggled throughout our time there and were teaching each other dance steps.   Never again.   Hubby ate 1/2 of his meal and said he didn't feel right.  Came home and got sick. Never again.  Half tempted to call the health dept.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
6,Mia R.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,1,,2.0,2015-09-18,"We just had dinner at Applebee's in Seaford and the food was o/k although the Napa chicken with Portobello ' s  was a little shy on the  portabello's.   My wife liked her dish. HOWEVER,  we arrived at around 5 PM FOR the happy hour and one of the many menu's on our table mentioned $2.50 drafts for the time we were there. Imagine our supreme when they were $3.99 ! Suprise !  We needed to sit 8 FEET AWAY IN the bar area to get the happy hour price, it was in the fine print but come on !!!!!! I GUESS THEY DON'T care about losing customers, Bill R.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
8,Raul L.,"Town N Country, Tampa Bay, FL",11,130,124.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"Ok so the place wasn't bad. I don't know if it's because we told the waitress people in Yelp had given it bad reviews or just that we went their on a good day. I ordered my regular from here ""4 cheese Macaroni dish"" and it was good.  Our waitress was on point with the refills and didn't interrupt us hardly at all. ""She was a Ninja"". Lol!! But any ways, good experience overall. We where able to get our food, eat it and not have to rush because our hour lunch had ran out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,

7,Kelly F.,"Federalsburg, MD",0,4,,2.0,2016-02-26,Food was meh. Bland. Server was good though. Won't be back. Did not need to hear about the bartenders personal life and her problems with her daughter.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
9,Mary M.,"Hampstead, NC",0,26,,2.0,2016-03-30,"We arrived around 5 PM on a Wednesday, and were quickly seated. Waitress eventually arrived and took our drink order.  We ordered nachos and salsa.  Salsa was very salty. Our entrees arrived after a lengthy wait minus our baked potatoes.  Waitress said the potatoes were still cooking.  Potatoes finally were served with butter only, no sour cream.  It was not offered, so I don't know if it was an option.  My potato was still somewhat firm.   We both ordered steaks.  They were cooked properly but we're VERY tough.  Side vegetables were so over cooked -- they were mushy. Waitress breezed by asking if everything was okay with no interest in our response. I never got a drink refill. Bottom line -- I would never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
10,Lucas H.,"Seaford, DE",0,8,,1.0,2016-08-25,You would think a salad with the word spinach in the name would actually have spinach in the salad - nope! Welcome to Seaford Applebee's!

4,Matt P.,"Federalsburg, MD",2,1,,1.0,2016-12-30,"It's been 4 months since I've eaten here. I should have stayed home. We got seated and had to wait 15 minutes until I flagged down a waiter who said he didn't know who our waiter was, but would take our order. They seem very short handed. Took forever to get anything. And the place wasn't even busy. Management at this restaurant is a joke. I asked for something to be discounted since we had to wait. Got no apologies, and was offered a free appetizer on my next visit. I had horrific service the last time I was there. I am absolutely never going to another Applebees ever again!! I would definitely recommend Texas Roadhouse across the road. Always fast and fantastic service there. And the food portions are bigger and better tasting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
3,Christina M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",138,1,,1.0,2017-03-17,"My friend that I'm on a road trip with is a manager at a corporate restaurant. We were starving but she didn't want to stop at Applebee's but it was the only place around. Boy, I wish I would've listened to her. It's like there is a lack of service culture around here! The hostess didn't even turn around to greet us! Isn't that her job?! The server next to her looked right at us and didn't say anything. The bartender was by far the worst part of this meal. Never once did she smile, I had to ask for refills on my drink, had to ask for everything. And we were the only people at the bar!! I planned on drinking more but didn't want to give her anymore of my time or money. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
5,Cory H.,"Seaford, DE",0,6,,2.0,2017-05-08,"Wait times for food to arrive are always long, even when there are only a handful of people dining. The typical scene are the very young staff just hanging out around the bar, discussing their personal issues, not checking on tables and certainly not looking busy. The food is okay, nothing the rave about but not bad. The 2 stars only is due to the staff, some unpleasant to deal with, others you only see once they take your order, then when they bring the check. Most often we have to flag down another staff member for help.  This would be a good place if it was managed correctly, and not like some comedy offshoot place to eat with drama teens. Really not worth the time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
2,Carter S.,"Cambridge, MD",8,3,,5.0,2017-07-22,"I never like going to Applebee's but this experience I had was truly different.The meal I had was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was probably one of the best meals I've had all year. The cook, wait staff and manager were second to none.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
0,YQuynh N.,"Germantown, MD",10,49,243.0,3.0,2017-08-05,"Came here for a meal with some friends. Our waitress was cheerful and checked on us multiple times throughout the dinner. The Spinach & Artichoke Chicken Cavatappi (ordered without the chicken) was a decent dish! Nicely seasoned and very filling. Only complaint was that there was an overload of spinach. Aside from that, I enjoyed my evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
1,Bobby M.,"Greenwood, DE",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-06,Wow is all I can say. We now have been in here for 45 minutes and only managed to be served a salad. They are not even busy. Worst service I have ever had at any Applebee's. This place is a joke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-seaford-3,,,,,
