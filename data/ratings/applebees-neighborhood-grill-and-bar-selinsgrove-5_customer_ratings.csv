16,Nathan W.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,41,,5.0,2012-01-25,"Don't understand why the ratings are so low for this location. The management and wait staff are friendly and quick. The food is always cooked correctly and comes out in a timely manner. Never really had an issue at this location, can't say the same for other Applebees, but this one is quite good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
13,Kyung B.,"Monrovia, CA",216,223,776.0,2.0,2013-02-23,"I woulda gave it 1 star but I gave it 2 for the ""funny"" incidents of always messing up my order. The first few times we were kinda scratching our heads but after they managed to mess it up every night we went. . It just became funny. We went quite often for drinks and 1/2 priced apps!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
10,Bob V.,"Montoursville, PA",11,76,198.0,5.0,2013-10-13,This restaurant was very good. The prices were reasonable and my family of five had a variety of food from a bacon cheeseburger  to a steak and also a chicken fingers and BLT. Everyone in my family thought what they had was great. The steak was perfectly cooked as was the cheeseburger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
15,Nicole S.,"Rockville, MD",0,6,1.0,3.0,2014-01-16,"Not generally a fan of Apple Bee's but the food at this location was very fresh. Facility was all over very clean and most of the staff polite... The exception to this was my waitress(Jen). After waiting for 7mins she finally approached to ask ""what do you want..."". Maybe it's a location difference but I'm not used to that sort of rude and abrupt service. Other than that a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
19,Wendy M.,"Avis, PA",0,4,,2.0,2014-05-30,"I never had any problems with Applebees whenever I dine at their restaurants . One particular night, My husband and I stopped in to this Applebees on January 24,2014 with my brother and his girlfriend. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was extremely crowded and busy, which is to be expected. Our waitress, who was very nice and we had no issues with. She was trying to make sure everyone was satisfied for a crowded night. When we received our drinks,my brothers coffee as explained by him tasted like ""burnt motor oil"" and the iced teas my husband, my brothers girfriend and I ordered had no flavor. When our entrees arrived. My brothers girlfriend who ordered the chicken alfredo mentioned there was too much garlic, the pasta was rubbery and the chicken was cold. I ordered the slider platter. My fries was cold so I pushed them aside. My brother ordered the shrimp platter and his shrimp was overcooked and rubbery. We paid over $40 for a very bad meal. We left without contacting the manager and I put in a bad experience comment to the restaurant. Within a day, The manager at this restaurant called me back and I explained how our dining experience was.  He felt about our bad experience and he offered us a $40 voucher to come back again. I didn't make it back down to use this voucher since it was about to be expired  so I gave it to my sister in law and husband to use at the Lewisburg restaurant. They mentioned they had a good experience. I'm happy everything was resolved. Maybe next time I am visiting the area; I may stop in but not on a night it is busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
7,Kim C.,"Manhattan, NY",18,30,187.0,4.0,2014-08-14,"Wait was only 10 minutes. Food was good and tried their promo 2 courses for $11.99. Only thing that could be improved is portion size, there could have been more at a family style restaurant. Service at this location was good too. All in all dinner was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
9,Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",211,594,214.0,3.0,2014-08-18,I went to Applebee's with my boyfriend on the way back home from NY. It was a pleasant surprised. Having not dined at an Applebee's in a over 3 years. I enjoyed my meal. It wasn't anything special (but my veggie burger and onion rings were satisfying). It was perfect for the long road trip we had ahead of us. The service at this Applebee's is outstanding. I saw a lot of professional (e.g. I saw a waitress ask another waitress to step outside with her to discuss something and our waitress checked in on several times during the meal).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
8,James W.,"Fairfax, VA",19,196,104.0,3.0,2014-08-21,"It's an Applebee's,  food was good and the service was prompt.  Nothing particularly special but it is an easy on and off highway if you're heading south and they have pretty good hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
12,Cody B.,"Cocolamus, PA",1,21,,4.0,2015-01-16,I'll be honest I'm not really a big fan of any Applebee's. It seems like anytime I ever eat at any Applebee's I get an upset stomach. So I usually only end up here hanging out with friends and eating something light. Service has never been bad here and they have something like Red Robins Ziosk so you can pay your bill at the table or call the server to the table. So it's modern enough. Just not my cup of tea.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
11,Tim K.,"Selinsgrove, PA",0,11,,2.0,2015-05-26,"Discover Card had a $25 gift card for $20 so I decided to get it.   To see the decline of Applebee's is somewhat shocking.  There use to be lines out the door.  No more!  This place is in dire need of a management overhaul.  Do they even train their staff anymore?  Did they just give up?   Our food was fair but the staff was pathetic.  No friendly greeting, no holding the door, no thank you  for stopping.   Our waitress brought my drink refill just in time for my last bite of food.  However, they had had plenty of time to clump at the corner of the bar and laugh and make snide remarks to each other.  There are a lot of new restaurants in the area.  This place is over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
3,C Z.,"Coal Township, PA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2016-12-28,"On the night after Christmas 2016, we took a party of 6 to the Susquehanna Trail Applebee's for what we hoped would be a relatively quick, tasty-enough dinner. Bad move. The visit started with a surly hostess and ended more than two hours later with medium-rare steak that was back and tough as a boot heel and a Southwest dinner salad with the pallor of corpse. The kitchen was slow and inept. They may have been short-staffed or they may have been untrained. Hard to tell. Waiter and bartender did their best to play a bad hand. They get the single star -- for courage.  The Susquehanna Trail is loaded with mediocre big-box restaurants. Applebees manages to stand out. Worst of the worst! A culinary train wreck with a big-budget ad campaign.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
6,Marcia L.,"Liverpool, PA",1,38,3.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"Nachos-  salty salty chips!  Salsa was Eh....Aldi's has better salsa!  No spice to it. Don't get the southwestern sirloin salad!  Steak was fatty. Salad dressing was overwhelming in quantity & cilantro!  Lots of iceberg lettuce & hardly any black beans.   Cheap cheap cheap on their part.   Pictures in menu are much prettier than the actual food that they bring out.  Mac & cheese is a waste of your money and calorie intake.  Elbows with cheese melted on top...buy some in the freezer section of your grocery store & you will be happier!  Service was good.  Randi did OK although she asked me how the salad was and I said just ok...and her comment was ""yea, it's different"".  6 ounce sirloin was good though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
5,Ashley B.,"Selinsgrove, PA",4,29,18.0,4.0,2017-05-04,"Always get the two for $20. Boneless honey BBQ wings with ranch,  they really cut back on the celery though. Like 3 pieces now which sucks bc I like celery with every bite of wing. And always get the fiesta lime chicken, with fries, side of sour cream n side of ranch. Fries have been WAY too salty. Last like 3-4 visits, always forget to tell waitress no salt. And have gotten the bacon mac n cheese, it's good. And just had the cedar grilled lemon chicken. It's delicious! I'll definitely get it again. Steaks are good too. Always been a fan of their steaks. Service is always pretty good. But I never go when they're too busy. I just won't. Lol me n my sons go-to sit down place for a decent meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
4,Alisa C.,"Vail, AZ",1,11,,3.0,2017-06-26,I ordered curbside to go. My order was ready on time and the man that brought my food to me was very nice. I ordered a salad with shrimp and everything was ok. There wasn't enough dressing and the shrimp seemed under done so I only ate a couple of pieces. If I was in the restaurant eating I would have asked for something different.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
2,Cait S.,"Winfield, PA",258,26,,5.0,2017-08-12,I love this location and the Lewisburg one. I've always received great service and come here a lot with my boyfriend who also enjoys it as much as I do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
1,Justin K.,"Dunedin, FL",0,1,,5.0,2017-09-11,Something above and beyond.  Driving through P.A on our way to NY to flea hurricane Irma from Florida. Orginally from NY was driving my family back up for a few days. Order 3 salads to go at about 3 on Sept 11th. The bartender who was amazing told me my salads should be done soon. We got to talking and found out we were from Florida. She goes to check on our salads and comes back with my food and a manager. Asked how long we were staying in the area. And I said just for lunch. The manager proceeded to tell me our meals were taken care of. A tiny gesture kept my faith in humanity. He didn't have to do that because we were victims of a natural disaster. These employees and this location deserve an amazing praise for a simple gesture you would hope many would do but few actually fulfill. I will continue my business at applebees strictly because of these employees. Thank you for everything!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
0,Kelly S.,"West Henrietta, NY",382,501,4516.0,4.0,2017-12-03,"Being a the road all day we wanted something other then fast food to eat, then we saw the sign for Applebee's. Service was amazing, the hostess knew we were tired and got us seated right away with drinks. Our server was the same way, order in right away and brought us some chips and salsa on the house. For dinner I went with the chicken tenders platter, switching out french fries for a side salad. Everything was great, just what I needed. I appreciated how the server made sure our drinks were never empty, he noticed when I was almost out of honey mustard sauce and brought more of that as well.  Just a great break from the road with some really good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-selinsgrove-5,,,,,
