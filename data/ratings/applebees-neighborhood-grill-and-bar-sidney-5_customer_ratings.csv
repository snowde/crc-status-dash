7,Margaret M.,"San Leandro, CA",24,29,32.0,5.0,2016-02-25,"For another franchise in Sidney, this Applebees hits a homerun in my book. For being open for 2 weeks, the dark wood ambiance is inviting and the hometown but modern decor and sportsbar adds class without being snobbish. The service was impeccable.  Sat at the bar during the tail-end of the lunch hour. A Blackberry Quencher was recommended as a starter. The server perfected it to my taste without complaint. I felt special! Second recommendation was the wonton shell chicken tacos. YUMMERS!! My only disappointment was my entre, everything on it was perfection (8oz sirloin cooked perfect medium and the 4 cheese Mac n Cheese with Bacon bits were to die for) except for the broccoli. It was steam to the consistency of baby food. Was not a fan. Again, my server was kind enough to INSIST on preparing me another side of broccoli which was not to my snobby crunchy perfect expectation BUT much better. My tastebuds were happy.  Overall, excellent experience. If Sidney's Applebees can keep this and attention to their food and service, it's a definite keeper and a must GO TO PLACE to dine out. It was truly a treat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
6,McKenzie C.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-17,"Terrible food, terrible service. I don't remember other Applebee's frying all of their food. Everything was fried! Our pretzels, quesadillas, shrimp were all surprisingly fried. Other food was served cold and not complete. The $13 salad was literally salad mix with fried shrimp on top.  Very disappointed. The service was slow too even though there were open tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
15,S J.,"Sidney, NE",0,4,,1.0,2016-05-28,If you don't have a lot of time better skip this one. It consistently takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours to eat at this Applebee's. Go to Buffalo Point across the street. It's locally owned and quick friendly service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
14,Val M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,2.0,4.0,2016-05-29,"Waitress Monica was great. Super friendly and attentive. Nice atmosphere...clean, appropriate television AFV and sports, music not too loud.  Food was middle of the road. It looked good but salad was skimpy and steak was way under seasoned and broccoli way over cooked. Steak was cooked to order.  Can't expect Ruth Chris for $13. Kids loved the 2/$25 crunchy shrimp.  I would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
12,Wright W.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,3,,5.0,2016-06-04,"I honestly have no idea what these others reviews have against this place, it's an Applebee's and that at the start makes it a good place to eat. However this location is very special and deserves to be listed as great for both service but especially the food. My trip the landed me there for a week. I ate three times and each time different wait staff and meals. All were at or near perfection at every level. This place is wonderful. If you are a complainer you may not like it but just remember to treat people with respect and you may get what you think you deserve. Yes I watched a few while I was eating with my family. Mostly white trash which was entertaining. Obviously not local to the area. Sidney has some of the best people with American values you will ever meet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
8,Amanda G.,"Sidney, NE",63,10,,2.0,2016-07-05,"I have always had great experiences at this restaurant and was expecting the same upon arrival with my family tonight. Our waitress didn't make eye contact with us once and wasn't pleasant; she told us we had to finish our drinks completely before we could order another one. She was impolite and not personable. She was trying to rush us through and get us to leave before we were done eating/drinking. The manager then came up and pointed his finger at his watch and asked if he should start charging us rent (mind you, we have been here for an hour and a half). We felt very unwelcome and won't come back for a long time. Food was good! Drinks were good! If you want to feel welcome, sadly don't come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
13,Manny H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,23,8.0,1.0,2016-07-26,"Really nice staff, but Horrendous service, and decent food for an Applebees. I eat here at least once a week or every other week. We have had multiple dinners that took over 2-2.5 hours. One dinner, our server didn't come by to get drink orders for 20 minutes and the restaurant was barely a quarter full. I've ordered take out several times that was quoted 15 minutes and waited for over 40. The food quality ends up being like your normal run of the mill Applebees, assuming they actually have the dishes in stock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
11,Eric M.,"Sidney, NE",0,5,,3.0,2016-08-14,Food is standard applebees. Competitive pricing for the area. Service is about as slow as this hot sunday was. 15 minutes for chips n salsa to arrive....nuff said.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
5,Kathryn M.,"Sidney, NE",2,8,,3.0,2016-08-28,"I've always enjoyed Applebee's menu and the food at this Applebee's is top notch but it is always freezing cold inside the Sidney store. Everyone knows that is a tactic to turn tables quicker.  I don't think it's too much to ask to be comfortable while I enjoy my meal.  I complained to the manager, Tim, and his reply was, ""It's fine in here."" I had to go out  to my car and get a winter hoodie.  My food was cold before I could finish it and I had to take half of it home and reheat it there. I thought about going back today but my friends and I decided that the service and attitude of the employees at Buffalo Point is also better and we want to eat in comfort so we'll be going there. Perhaps the reason Applebee's is always looking for employees may be the managers attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
9,Brandon S.,"Sidney, NE",22,5,,3.0,2016-10-09,The food was decent but the service was awful.  Failed to serve our salad before the main meal arrived and the waitress didn't care to keep our drinks full either. The TVs had terrible lag watching a football game to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
4,Šeila Š.,"Pittsburgh, PA",35,26,7.0,3.0,2016-12-02,Meh.. just another chain ... service is not the worst in Sidney but Sooooooo SLOW!!!!!!!! Even when no one is in there !!!!! lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
10,Brandon R.,"Julesburg, CO",11,1,,1.0,2017-05-30,This applebees is horrible. Locally we only go out for a sit down meal once a month and when Applebees first opened was ok at best. After the hype wore off they lost the professionalism of their servers (I've heard them blatantly argue with a customer because they didn't want to run their card and tried to make the family pay with cash).The last 3 times we've gone they've messed up our order in some way shape or form even after complaining to the manager they just basically told us tough cookies. And it took over an hour to get our drinks and 2 hours for our meal when we went their for my wife and I's birthday. Won't be going there again unless major changes happen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,

3,Beau F.,"Keystone, CO",0,4,,2.0,2017-07-09,Very slow inattentive service. Food was very poor compared to most other Applebee's locations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
0,Rich L.,"Bellevue, ID",21,26,14.0,4.0,2017-07-14,"Came in on a fairly busy Friday night, hostess greeted and seated us promptly, even asking about our table preference.    Ashley, our waitress, came to our table within a couple of minutes of being seated. Took drink orders, came back with drinks and graciously answered our menu questions.    We did the 2-4-25 deal with a rack of ribs and bourbon chicken. Salads came out quickly, and entrees came out the very second we finished the last bite of salad.   Ashley checked on us, brought us extra napkins, refilled drinks, and brought sour cream on request.   There was no reason I could find that made this any less than a 4 star visit, I don't see a good reason why this place was rated 3 stars with sone harsh reviews, maybe just a one off bad visit?   With so little in Sidney to choose from, this was a safe pick.   Go ahead and go, its pretty decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sidney-5,,,,,
