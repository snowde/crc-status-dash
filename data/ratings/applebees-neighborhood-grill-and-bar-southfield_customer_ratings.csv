34,Julian B.,"Southfield, MI",109,123,794.0,3.0,2014-12-01,Great service from David. My mom askd a million questions. Food was good. I got a burger and mom got the lunch shrimp pasta deal. Burger and fries were both tasty. I added Onion strings to a regular burger. Only complaint was both the burger and fries were lukewarm. Tasted some of her Caesar salad. Solid. Pasta dish looked unappealing.  I may make this an occassional spot for drinks and catch some of the game since there are tvs all around. Menu leaves much to be desired like many of these chains. Great happy hour specials on food and drinks. Very fair drink prices. Perfect sangria margarita was a star. Will be back for that. There were a couple other snafus but I let it slide since they just opened.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=40,1.7080000000000002,1.7080000000000002,1.7080000000000002,1.7080000000000002,1.7080000000000004
23,Robyn L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",1,19,3.0,1.0,2014-12-03,"First thing the waitress said was ""I can start you with some drinks but our Kitchen is extremely backed up and the food may take a while."" I should have left the moment she said that! Applebee's has never been my favorite place but this is a new location and worth a try... A try that failed. We were in here for 2 hours our Chips and Salsa appetizer was mainly chips from 'the bottom of the bag' all broken pieces, our food took forever and we felt ill after we left! I will not be returning...

22,Joe E.,"Southfield, MI",0,11,2.0,2.0,2014-12-07,"I was very happy to have an Applebee's open up in our neighborhood to give us a choice instead of just the coney's in the area for something later at night.  I am a local truck driver and work 12 to 14 hours a day 6 days a week so as you can imagine it can be hard to find a place to have dinner with my wife. We arrived at 12:30am.  The kitchen closes at 1am and the place closes at 2am.  We were greeted promptly and seated near the bar and our server Nakia T was almost waiting at the table with menus and a big smile.  She took our drink orders and left us to choose from the menu.  When she returned with our drinks she asked if we had any questions and then took our order.  My wife ordered the Riblets and I ordered the Double Barrel Whiskey steaks.  The drinks were excellent, I had a Sidecar and my wife had the Perfect Sangria Margarita. Our meals came and both were done well, as ordered and very tasty.  I really couldn't ask for much more. And now to the reason for only a two star review.  About halfway through our meal some of the staff got off work and sat at the bar right next to us.  They were soon talking and joking with the bartenders and each other and the noise level kept going up.  Soon they were almost yelling and my wife and I couldn't even hear each other or the server.  I told our server how uncomfortable it was getting and asked if she could do something about it.  It wasn't till I told her I needed my check because it had gotten so bad I just wanted to leave that she went over and asked them to quiet down.  One of the staff turned and apologized, but seriously by that time my mood was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=40,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576
55,Diana F.,"Oak Park, MI",1,2,31.0,1.0,2014-12-17,"First off if i could give this place no stars it would be ZERO. We were very excited about an Applebee's close by. But were very disappointed with the service.  First we get there and we are parents so we are shoved in the back corner by the bathrooms. Our waitress didn't even know to take a drink order before food, was snarky cause when we ordered she didn't ask about what sides and I had the nerve to ask about what kind of poatatoes. She brought out our drinks with the appetizers but left the kids in the back till they brought out their food. And crying thirsty kids is no fun... I never saw her in between once or I would have asked for them. We had to ask twice for refills and then sat over 25mins waiting on the bill. With 3 YOUNG kids. No sorry for the wait nothing. My husband decided to tip her very hefty even after all that. And guess what she her grabbed the bill and money looked down at it, counted it and walked away. No thank you.  No have a good night. SO RUDE! (We know waitresses live off their tips) he still gave her 22% way over what an average tip is.  Do yourself a favor and don't go to this one. The ones further away are worth the drive. There were many people in there tonight complaining. The manager was at 5 different tables on our side alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=60,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000004

She had a warm a friendly greeting and a smile. She walked me and my mother to our table and explained to us the specials for today. Our server name was Whitney. I can tell she had a poor attitude when she came to the table. She was not enthused about waiting on us. Then I saw the manager Tim and asked him to wait on us. He made sure our food came out the way we liked it. We left Whitney a 10% tip. We wanted to tip Tim the Manager, but he refused. He stated that it was his pleasure to take care of us and gave 2 five dollar off cards and asked us to come back. Whitney has a poor attitude and needs to be trained in customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=80,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000004

69,Sue O.,"Novi, MI",2,5,,2.0,2014-12-28,"Our family decided to try this Applebee's that just opened on Southfield Rd and Twelve Mile Rd in Southfield. We walked in during a Lions game and worried it would be too busy. We were seated right away with menus but it took 10 minutes to get our drink order..that's only because the bartender, DJ, came to help us. She said our waitress would be with us shortly. It took 20 minutes for the bartender to come back and take our order because our waitress was too busy to check in with us ever. While we waited, Trevon from the bar came to replenish our drinks. Our food came out about 20 minutes later. It was hot and delicious. The All-In American standard burger was the top choice at our table. I don't think highly of the waitress who was MIA and whom we never met but DJ and Trevon helped us and checked in and impressed us. They were the saving grace for our visit. Had DJ not taken the time to help us, we were ready to walk out. Very nice visit after that. Another complaint was the TVs were way too loud. We could barely hear each other at our table. I get that the football game was on but when that ended, the Simpson's came on. Not what I want to hear at dinner on a Sunday night. Also, for the complaints we had, the manager never stopped by to check in with us though the placard on the table said the manager stops by or you get a $5 certificate. We got neither. DJ and Trevon are definitely assets to your company. The rest of the staff needs some work and customer service training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=80,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000001,1.6400000000000003

The waitress messed up our drink order, rarely returned to our table and we ordered a medium 9oz steak which came to our table short a couple of ounces and looked as if a McDonalds employee had cooked it. The steak was completely well done.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she returned to the table but another 20 minuets went by so we decided to just eat it.

First, the service was paiiinfullyyy slow and bad! We must have waited 10 minutes to order, then 30 minutes for our food to come out. Also, our server Deshawn did not seem to know about the Yelp check-in offer and thought we had to be sitting AT the bar to get the free bar snack. Not true, we insisted so he checked and we were right. There seemed to be A LOT of servers compared to customers, yet our server always seemed to be somewhere else. And if you're going to advertise and run specials for checking in on social media, the servers need to be knowledgeable about them, not seem like it's the first time they heard of them.  Second, my food tasted like I tried to cook and failed. I had the healthy under 600 calorie Steakhouse Bruschetta Sirloin with a side of roasted potatoes. Potatoes tasted like nothing, and the steak was tough and not seasoned well. And my dish looked nothing like their photo. Same for the BF's Mac and cheese entree...it was tiny and cold.  Third, my food was COLD. Deshawn passed by our table several times as we looked at him, expecting him to tell us why our food was so delayed. He said our food would be out ""shortly."" It wasn't, and when it came out it was COLD. I would have sent my food back, but I didn't want to WAIT ANY LONGER. I ate part of it and left still hungry. Not worth the $13.99.

The so called ""neighborhood bar & grill"", welcome to Southfield, glad you could find our city of 70k on the map and decide to bless us with your services! I went skiing a few years ago near Petoskey, Michigan, population about 5k and guess what? They had a AppleBees way before Southfield! Now let's talk about your Southfield implementation. If you know it or know the land where AppleBees is located has been topic of conversation for many, many years. After Catholic Church closed the school once located there, many developers attempted to acquire that location. Most note able was WalMart which was met with huge community out cry for many reasons. Fast forward AppleBees is now on the site of the intersection that has been ranked in top three for accidents for whole state of Michigan for a decade.   Now to the venue.  Way smaller then any other AppleBees I have visited and some sort of new layout configuration that is just not working for me! Restaurant just did not seem to have a good flow or separation of bar and family patrons. However this issue is not a show stopper! I was looking for a venue to take the spot of the Friday's on evergreen and could be a Friday hangout for co-workers but and also serve as a nice spot to bring the family.  Service is horrible, it's slow and unapologetic! They weren't rude, just seemed to have no vested interest in ensuring that we had a positive experience.   Our waitress was young, very green and not well trained.  We witness her frequently joking and talking to other employees vs checking on us.  We ordered happy hour specials.  When food was brought out by a different waitress, there was two too many plates. We explained that the extra food was not ours to which we were too, ""well you can have them anyway!"" Normally who does not enjoy a good hook up! But us eating that food, meant someone who actually ordered it had to wait another 20 mins to get their food.   That was pretty much the theme of the night as we were met with employee after employee that just did not seem to care about controlling their environment, either via company cost or customer experience. I've visited AppleBees a couple more time since and while it does not reach the craziness of Friday's and turn into a night club, it does nothing to separate itself in regards to quality food and service.  It's mediocre at best! I prefer the Novi or Livonia or this one!  Location wise, it's not located near anything that would complement a evening out with your wife or girlfriend.  It's about 3 miles from the movie theater. Southfield road is not know for nightlife so good luck if your going to make a night of if starting at ApplesBees!  They will be there for awhile cause again the Southfield city planner sucks so our options are limited!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.832,1.96

93,Jas Q.,"Oak Park, MI",0,25,6.0,1.0,2015-12-02,"I've been to this location about 3 times. Service was just okay the first 2 times. The last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. About 3 weeks ago my boyfriend's uncle came from Florida to visit, due to our work schedules we were only available to all go to dinner once. I stay in the Southfield area so this location is about 5 minutes from our house. We decided to go Nov 15, 2015 around 8 p.m. We arrived and were seated immediately, I really can't remember the host much, I think we were her last table to seat and possibly clock out time. About 5 minutes later our waitress came to our table to take our drink orders, 2 waters and 1 sweet tea. About 10 minutes later we received our drinks, with melted down ice like it was sitting and also unsweetened tea. My question is why did it take 10 minutes if we were her only table? No big deal, we went ahead and ordered two appetizers. 20 minutes later we received cold boneless wings with cold sauce thrown on top and cold chewy cheese sticks. My boyfriend's uncle pulled out his silverware which had a dried piece of rice still stuck to it. Eww! So we got our waitress and showed her the cold food, also the dirty silverware. She didn't bother to replace or take away the dirty silverware. She just took the food back, possibly irritated. She then came back 5 minutes later with kind of warm food, not hot like they just came out. Not hot like we were her only table. We started to question what she was doing in the back. She wasn't attentive to us and kept giving us cold food. So we recieved the entrees, two cold 4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken and a salmon meal. The pastas were lacking the garlic bread that is included. The food looked dry, so they asked for more sauce because you could see bare noodles. The waitress came back with a cup of cold sauce for the pasta. At this point we are still hungry and upset. Nothing was good, she couldn't get a glass of ice water.  We just complained and asked for the bill. Most resturants will have the manager come out to address the problem and waiver the meal. The food was barely touched! It's not like we just had the feast of our lives. She came back and reduced our bill by $5, why if we didn't eat it. So we asked for the manager, a few minutes go by the night shift manager pops up with a fake smile. We knew that the waitress was bad talking us in the back, I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't get a taste of someones spit in the back. We showed her all the uneaten food and also the dirty silverware, she acted so shocked but writing this review I see other similar complaints. She dashed to the back and took another $5 off the bill. A few minutes after the waitress came to clean off the table. No one offered to replace it, by this point we didn't even want anything from them. Even on a good day the service is just bad and unprofessional. The waitress got the last plate and said ""Y'all just came for the hot food and the drinks"". I had to excuse myself and go outside, I was about to go off and I'm sure security would have been called. Point One we didn't even get hot or even warm food, Point Two our drinks were melted with ice before we even got it. She basically called us bums, my boyfriend still tipped and left with the receipt and all.  I wrote an email to Applebee's that Monday, I was called on Thursday from the general manager. I told him the story and he sounded shocked, and that he wanted us to give it another try and that a gift certificate would be mailed. 3 weeks later and still nothing, because he didn't send it. As I said I live 5 minutes away, mail from China came before this gift card. They will never get another $1 from me....Ever! Sad, its a newer location but it seems like no one was trained.

I am not asking to be your friend while I am their but how do you expect to get tipped if you can't even check on our table and refill waters, or made sure our orders came out right. The only time when we did see our server was when she took our food order, checked on us because it took about 30 minutes to get our food and our bill. This is not my first time here but this time particularly was just an awful experience. If I ever do come back I am gonna ask for a different server.  As for the food I had the fiesta chicken chopped salad, It was NOT up to par!!! I hate sending things back because i feel bad and food is food. But this salad had the wrong ingredients, they put a lot of nuts in the salad which is not supposed to have any, barely any ingredients of which was listed on the menu and they forgot the chicken. When the chicken came out it was not the chimichurri glazed chicken that was supposed to be on it but pretty much just slathered in oil.

Ordered the 1 appetizer, 2 entree for $25  Boneless wings, half rack pork ribs with onion rings and coleslaw, and bourbon street chicken and shrimp. It's a good deal.  Small portions though.   The taste was bearable to keep the stomach full,  but I was not palatably satisfied.   You may need to season the ribs with salt, while the shrimp had some dressing drizzled on top that tasted bitter for me. Be careful when you change the sides, because it may cost extra.  My husband asked if it's ok to have onion rings instead of fries for the ribs.   The server said  it's ok, and made us believe there was no charge.  When we checked out, we got billed extra $1.99 for that. What's unique about Applebee's is the touch screen gadget they placed per table.  It's a mini tablet where you can order your meals, request drink refill, and pay by swiping your credit card.  Be aware when kids start playing games...it's extra $1.99 to play unlimited in the tablet.

I told my 5 year old that she could eat anywhere for having an awesome week. I guess she had seen a lot of applebees commercials and she begged me to take her here. Fine. I figured ""how bad could it be"". We walked in and were immediately seated. Then we waited, and waited and waited. About 2 tables away all the servers were congregating over a back table. No one seemed to care. No one brought us water.  I finally waved someone down and explained that we had been waiting 15 min. No apologies. Just ""well I do not handle your table but I guess I can help you out"". During this time my 5 year old discovered the iPad on the table. I thought. Ok...this is kind of cool. Little did I know we would later be charged for the usage. There were no parental locks. No warnings that we would be charged. OF COURSE my 5 year old would grab the iPad on the table and just start using it.  Once we finally ordered it took forever for our food to come out. I don't remember what my daughter ordered but they were out of something so they just brought something else instead. Didn't ask us. Just brought something else. So odd. My food was barely cooked. The vegetables in my skillet were still raw and I was honestly nervous to even eat the shrimp on my plate because they just did not seem cooked.

It would be another 15 minutes.  There was no sense of urgency from her or the staff to accommodate the customers that were there creating a safety hazard standing in front of the doors. Eventually a server came in and people began to be seated, turns out there were parties waiting in the bar area to be seated also, so we were about 7th in line. Everyone was seated in the area that they claimed needed to be bussed.(I took pictures of the tables that were already cleaned off). The only positive was that when the server did arrive she was very polite and apologized for the wait.  We asked for a complimentary appetizer and the manager did agree to that. I just wonder why we had to ask.

I ordered food and a drink. After waiting forever and a day, the drink came out, but the food never came. A server notices that I don't have my food so she went back to check. She never came back so I called another server from that electronic device on the table. Nobody came. At one point, I saw a server walk past me and try to place food on a table nearby. The family let them know that they didn't order what she brought out. Thinking back, maybe it was my order, but it wouldn't make sense that she wouldn't know where the order came from. I ordered the food from the electronic device on my table. Why would she take it to another table? She also hurried off instead of trying to figure out where the order came from. She never came back, so maybe it wasn't mine. After wasting an hour trying to get some food, I paid for the drink and left. I probably won't be back for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
8,Millie B.,"Canton, MI",0,5,,1.0,2017-10-06,"Would not give them even a one star review but unable to enter a review unless a star is selected. They deserve a - zero not one star. Absolute poorest service ever!!!! Sat 25-30 minutes watching wait staff walk around looking angry/overwhelmed and uninterested in serving any customer. The weirdest thing is the place was not busy. Approached the bartender who could see us sitting there and knew that we hadn't even been given water, to see if we could at least get our drinks and was told she couldn't take a drink order and we were to wait for a unavailable server.  We waited a bit further and were again not approached! We walked out after we were never approached by any staff member. They all appeared angry to be there working. WILL NEVER GO NEAR THAT PLACE AGAIN!!

Tried curbside pick up and waited 45 minutes even though I arrived 20 minutes late for the order! When I did receive the order, half of the food inside was not what I had ordered. I then had to wait for them to find my food. I then had to wait for them to complete my order. By the time I got home the hot food was cold and the cold food was warm!

7,Olivia N.,"Birmingham, MI",29,11,1.0,1.0,2017-10-17,Literally the worst Applebee's location there is. The customer service is awful. The wait time is so long for even something as simple as water.

6,Julianna P.,"Warren, MI",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-10-19,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to. I have gotten the car side to go a few times for lunch and the service is horrible. Be prepared to sit and wait in your car for about 30 minutes before you get your food. I have had a few bad experiences there but mostly minor stuff. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal and sometimes things happen, so no reason to get upset. But today was the last straw. I ordered my food online, said it would be ready st 11:15, I didn't get there until 11:30 purposely hoping that would minimize the 30 minute wait period that I'm usually parked out there for. Ten minutes later a server comes out and asks my name, says she had my order and she will be right back. Never see her again. About 5-10 minutes later a gentleman comes out asks me the same thing and says he will get my order together. When I get my food EVERYTHING is wrong. Even though I just explained to two different people EXACTLY what I got. They gave me the wrong salad, wrong dressing and Mac & cheese was missing chicken tenders and looked like plain dry noodles with 7 strands of shredded cheese melted over  the top. When I told him it was wrong he brought out a small sauce size container with my ""chicken tenders"" which was pretty small bits of breading from what may have been chicken at one point, and didn't put a lid on the salad dressing which spilled mostly outside of the carry out container. On the bright side, i got out of there in 25 minutes...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
10,Claudette M.,"Kitchener, Canada",231,20,391.0,4.0,2017-10-20,"This was my last stop before going home from my book signing in Chicago. I love Applebee's and always get the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is gluten-free. The restaurant was clean and your typical Applebee's. My server, Diamond, did an okay job, but do you ever feel like you're talking to someone and they don't really listen? That's kind of how I felt. I asked for extra Pico de Gallo but she didn't bring it. I asked her not to put slaw in my husband's takeout dinner of chicken strips. He hates the sight of it. She put it in anyway. As I was leaving, I said goodbye and thank you to her. She was at another table but didn't even acknowledge my existence. I got my food in good time and she brought everything she should, but I just felt like she didn't care. I don't get to go out to eat that often, so I don't like being made to feel that way, especially when the servers for the rest of my trip were busier but offered great service with much more friendliness.  The chicken was delicious and hubby enjoyed his chicken and cheese sticks as well, but I would pick a different location for sure next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
77,K. B.,"Southfield, MI",0,53,,3.0,2017-12-01,"Now I understand some of the lower ratings.  I was in there again, a few days ago, and was somewhat disappointed in the service I got.  I was in there around 3:30 or so in the afternoon, and there couldn't have been more than 1 or 2 more tables with customers sitting at them; yet, it took my server, whose name I wish I could remember, a good 15 to 20 minutes to bring me a glass of water, after ordering my food, which came 10 to 15 minutes after that.  No doubt, she was nice enough, and apologized for the delay, but that's no excuse for inefficiency, especially when the place isn't crowded.  I had the full rack of baby back ribs, mashed sweet potatoes with pecans and maple syrup, and some buttered, steamed broccoli.  The food was delicious, and the server was actually nice, which is why I left a tip, and didn't lower my rating anymore than I did.  However, inefficient service, when the place isn't even crowded, is the reason I doubt if I'll be coming back again any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield?start=20,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
1,Jennifer P.,"Southfield, MI",85,13,26.0,1.0,2017-12-10,"I've been to this chain restaurant multiple times in the past few years. And by ""multiple"" I mean like five times in total. Each time was bad and more worse than the previous visit. This is probably my final time giving a chance to this specific restaurant. Let me tell you about my other experiences before this one: Each and EVERY TIME the servers have been slow. You practically have to beg them for attention. No matter if they have one table or fifty tables, you definitely won't be getting water until at least 20 minutes of sitting there twiddling your thumbs. By that time, I make sure I tell my friends to get ready to order what they wanna eat since we probably won't be seeing the waiter or waitress again for another 20 minutes. There was one time where I came with a group of friends. It was a triple date so there was six of us in total. The waitress gave us water and inside the cup it had the pieces of paper from the straw pretty much compounded in there as if they don't wash the cups after every use. DISGUSTING is all I gotta say to that. And it wasn't just one or two of our cups, it was every single one.  This specific time, we came in for their Steak and Potatoes deal that's been advertised with every YouTube ad out there. Boyfriend was hungry so I decided to treat him. We haven't went to this place for MONTHS due to the bad service every time, but decided to go here since this was the closest Applebee's location.  When I got there, I checked in -- FREE APPETIZER with a purchase of a beverage! Nice! The waitress finally comes around and I let her know about the deal as well as us already being ready to order our steak and potatoes meal. The appetizer is eventually brought out and when it is brought out, the waitress lets us know that they've ran out of steaks. What? -- Erm, that's quite disheartening especially knowing that they have that special. But we didn't make a big deal out of it and decided to look at the menu again. Once we finished our appetizer, we decided to just go to another Applebee's for the steak and potato special (what can I say? We were craving it) and made sure we called the next closest Applebee's to us, to make sure they had steaks. We let the waitress know that we weren't interested in anything else and would like the bill. I waited for her to come back with it and she came back to tell us that they didn't have any more 8oz steaks, but had 6oz steaks. What (again)? I really just wanted to say, ""why didn't you tell us that in the first place?"" But refrained since I didn't want to come off as rude. At that point, my boyfriend and I decided to stay and deal with it. We ordered medium rare and our steaks came out well done. *Sigh* It's like they can't do anything right here. Another thing to add is that EVERY time, no matter what the circumstance was -- whether there was paper in my water cup or the waitress lying to us recently and telling us there were no more steaks -- we never got compensated. I mean, even offering a free dessert would have changed my mind about the customer service here a little bit.  All in all, try it out for yourself but I can GAURANTEE you the service is below average. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you were my worst enemy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
0,Shane K.,"Franklin, MI",101,9,5.0,2.0,2017-12-17,Disappointment to the least. Truly the reason chain restaurants are now at their downfall. The employment of individuals with no desire to profit from hard work shows directly within the confines of this NEW establishment. Being less than a few years old in a new thriving plaza. I would expect corporate let alone the owner paying rent for franchise to be optimizing not only his profits but employees. With more than a hour and half remaining before close and the acknowledgement of their closing the rudeness is inexcusable. I truly wish businesses such as these did a better job of creating responsibility. Also place was ridiculously filthy and trashed.  Wouldn't let a homeless man eat here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southfield,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
