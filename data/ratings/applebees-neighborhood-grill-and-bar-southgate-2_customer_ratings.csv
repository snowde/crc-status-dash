37,Nikki C.,"Detroit, MI",134,348,24.0,1.0,2012-02-09,"While it was really packed the evening that I went, I checked in on Foursquare and read some of the tips people left about the place. Not good at all. The first complaint from people was the food, next was the service. I should have taken the hint. We didn't have to wait too long, but once we were seated, my mom & I both went with the fish & chips. Simple, right? Oh and we ordered the ""butterfly chips"" as an appetizer. I was looking forward to the yummy sounding dip.  We waited... and waited... and -- oh, here comes the appetizer! Yay!  The server comes by and asks if it's warm enough -- I immediately said ""yes"" because I often want to just enjoy the food and not answer questions all evening. My mom begged to differ. But more importantly -- why did he ask if they were warm enough for us? Is that a normal complaint they get? Had they been sitting unattended for some time before being delivered to us? I thought that was rather suspect.  But nevermind that... what really took the cake was the fact that our meal came immediately after the appetizer hit the table. What?? Who does that??  Our faces asked the same question... the waiter said ""I can take these back and keep them warm"". Umm, NO! Fried fish kept warm = soggy fried fish. No. Nononono. We'll just keep our meals and nibble on the now, really cold butterfly chips.The waiter sensed our issue and directed his manager to our table. We expressed our concerns and he offered us a free dessert shooter. He *should have* offered to comp our appetizer. Because by the time we're done with all that, who has room for dessert?  I ended up taking the hot fudge sundae shooter and my mom went for the cheesecake shooter. Wise choice -- the cheesecake was better.  The service (our waiter) wasn't bad, but the timing sucked and so did the quality of the food.  p.s. A table adjacent to us had big time issues with their food. I overheard their complaints and dialogue with their waiter and manager, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southgate-2?start=20,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

The food is always great, and there's definitely an understanding of what to do and where to put certain foods on the plate. Lots of flavors. However, the food isn't always the freshest (freezer burned bread sticks, pre-prepped veggies). Proportions could be a bit bigger too for what you pay. Servers consist of mostly young high school and college aged women as most of these kinds of restaurants are. Our server was nice, nothing extraordinary though.  The interior is usually very clean and the atmosphere is very welcoming.

35,Chelsea T.,"Southgate, MI",22,4,,1.0,2015-10-11,"Why is it so hard to find a list of the half off appetizers for this particular location? My boyfriend and I chose to dine at Apple Bee's for the 2 for $25 deal along with the half off appetizers after 10. We were very disappointed. First our wanton tacos came with no lime. By the time anyone was around to ask for some, they were already bringing out the rest of our order. Our salads were disgusting. They both consisted of large chunks of the gross yellow unchopped lettuce and very little of the green lettuce that should have been there. I was given the tiniest most useless piece of lemon for my shrimp. Seriously? What's the point of chincing on lemon? Then  our bill came and we noticed we were charged full price for our wanton tacos. We have come to this location in the past and they have always been half off but it wasn't until after we ordered and ate them that we were made aware that they were no longer included. We would've passed and ordered something different had our thoughtless server made any effort to let us know about that when we decided to order an additional appetizer. We will not be returning to this establishment. Next time we decide we want Apple Bee's for dinner, we'll go to McDonald's or a local diner instead and save ourselves the time, money and  frustration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-southgate-2?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

It's on a prime location where most of the friends/family gathering chain restaurants are located. A few steps away is a theatre,, you know what that means??? Perfect for date night... DINNER AND A MOVIE. The king of half prize apps has done it again. It's like a man who finally quit sagging his pants. All grown up, polished and still cool as a bag ice. Aside from the interior face lift and the new yummy items on their appetizer arsenal. There's now local craft beer on tap and good local distillery liquors as well. Atwater, Bells, Kunheign and Valentines to name a few booze names that are making their way into a glass near you. Applebee's has always been the favorite spot for a gathering. Whether it's for an occasion or the start of a boys/girls night out. It's not a hard choice for anybody to pick. The price is right, the drinks get you drunk and the food fills you up.

Today the food we got from Applebee's Car Side To Go was just terrible. The Crispy Cheddar Bacon potatoes were just pitiful and hardly anything in the box. The two orders of boneless wings were so dry and over cooked - almost seems like they had gotten cold after being cooked once and they tried to fry them again to heat them up! I could not even stab some of them with a fork! Totally not edible!  The real kick in the teeth..... When I called to speak with the manager, he really didn't seem to care at all!
