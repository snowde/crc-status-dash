5,Christine S.,"Spokane, WA",2,58,6.0,3.0,2012-02-16,"Ok, I love Applebees, I really have to admit it. But, what I don't like is when my steak isn't cooked to my request, that makes me a very grumpy and unhappy person.  My current love is the garlic sirloin with creamed spinach atop a portobello mushroom and red potatoes. It is part of the healthier, lighter menu they offer with an approval stamp from weight watchers, I have had it 3 times now, it is very good and addicting!  Last time I had it though, I asked for it to be cooked medium, it came to me well done. Also, the cook peppered *everything* and to make it worse, I HATE black pepper! The server was sweet, she had a manager come by and he asked about my food, I said the cook peppered my food beyond being edible for me. The entree was taken off our tab (thankfully!). The server felt so bad and kept saying sorry. I assured her it wasn't her fault, she took our order, made sure we were happy, our apps & drinks were brought to us in a timely manner, she was tipped well, the cook making our food wasn't her fault. I love the chicken won tons (appetizers) & their spinach dip. I don't like the drinks here, aside from the mudslide. If you have a good bartender that night, they will make the mudslide properly. I also like their dessert shooters, the chocolate mousse was great with oreo cookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5?start=20,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

24,Scott B.,"Spokane, WA",8,119,27.0,4.0,2013-02-17,"My family and I decided to eat here yesterday and I felt I needed to give a review.  We were told the wait time was 15 minutes.  At about 30 minutes in the manager came over to us and proceeded to apologize because we were not seated yet.  We hadn't complained nor even made any ""quiet"" comments.  He was just being an attentive manager.  After apologizing for the wait he asked us what appetizer we would like and he would order it for us (on the house) and he would have it waiting for us at our table when we were seated.  Very good customer service.   On the food side I think they could have done much better.  The appetizers were perfect, but the entrees were all bland.  I had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and it was extremely bland.  The same could be said for all the other dishes at our table.  A little seasoning would go a long way.  My wife loves the fiesta lime chicken and in the past it had a much better flavor.   I will come back because of the service but I will hope the kitchen kicks it up a notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

6,Sofia W.,"Spokane, WA",0,5,,1.0,2014-04-17,"Almost every single time my family and I eat here we get bad service. Every other Applebee's has way better food and service. 90% of the time the servers ignore you and are rude. It feels like they hangout in the back as much as possible. There could be three people in the whole restaurant and 4 servers, you'll still get slow horrible service. They always seem to be hiring and training. Way beyond average. Recently I called around noon to ask a question and a female manager answered. She proceeded to lecture me about calling around that time, before answering my question. My question needed a simple yes or no answer. Lecturing me just made the call longer than it needed to be. I couldn't believe how rude and condescending she was. Maybe that's the reason for such a high turnover rate. Go to a different Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5?start=20,,,,,
25,Ray N.,"Spokane, WA",1,40,1.0,3.0,2014-08-07,Service was excellent.  Had the shrimp scampi which was...mediocre.  The plating was poorly thought out.  The poor waitress was trying to keep the plates from sliding.  She did awesome.  They just need a vision or a niche.  Something to set them apart.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,

27,Todd F.,"Spokane, WA",42,10,,1.0,2015-04-02,"Bait and Switch,  I'll admit the national advertising got me there for after 10pm discounts. I arrived learning the discounts start at 9pm. After waiting a while, I try out the automated order system - big mistake.  The appetizers on the self-service order pad were not discounted at all.  Call me a sucker.  Their marketing has major holes and inconsistencies, I felt sorry for the servers trying to work under such misleading communication.

18,Erik K.,"Coraopolis, PA",12,27,,1.0,2015-07-09,"I swear our waiter was high. The idea of going to a restaurant is to get your food all together, not staggered over 10 minutes. My French onion soup (delivered after my entree) was lukewarm and the cheese was not cooked. My buddy ordered a large beer received a small. Our waiter Brett was useless.  He forgot items, we had to ask several times for missing items from our selections. The manager Tyler was good, he tried to make things right service wise...but after telling him about our experience there was nothing offered as compensation. I don't often go to Applebee's because there isn't one particularly close to my house, but I know I won't be back to this one ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,

28,Jen J.,"Spokane, WA",1,12,,3.0,2015-09-20,"The food is good most of the time.  I received French onion soup that wasn't cooked enough and the cheese was not melted and they had to heat it up. I received the potstickers and the sauce tasted like oil without the flavoring so I had to send it back.  I received salad there and it came without any salad dressing and they had to bring some to me.  Today I sat there for 10 to 15 minutes with my empty soda glass without anybody coming by to ask me if I wanted a refill.  And when you're the only person sitting in that section of the restaurant and no one's paying attention, It gets to be a bit frustrating.  The bartender can leave his work area to seat people who come in the door, but can't come over to fill my soda when I'm only a foot away is messed up. I may be more forgiving if my order is wrong or if the food isn't as good as usual, but I expect decent customer service.  Especially when there are so many other restaurants to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,

16,Christie S.,"Spokane, WA",0,18,6.0,4.0,2016-01-21,"I am writing this review mostly to praise the customer service at this location, though the food is pretty darn good, the atmosphere and staff are outstanding!  After a very bad experience at another restaurant where I walked out without eating, my friend and I came to Applebee's because it was getting late, and we know this location stays open later than most places in North Spokane. Though I thought my night was ruined, it turned out to be a happy accident - because it led me to one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  We sat in the bar (which we prefer because it's so cozy and relaxed, with lots of TV and things to look at), and were greeted by our server Brittany. She asked how our night was, and I immediately vented about the restaurant I'd just walked out of. She said that she had another couple who came in complaining about the same restaurant - and from there we had easy conversation and I immediately felt comfortable with her. She recommended great drinks (she's a great bartender because they were delicious, too) and was very attentive. There were a few other people in the bar area, and she was great with them all.  When our food arrived, I was impressed. I ordered a steak, which was cooked to absolute perfection (if you see my previous reviews, you'll notice I don't throw around that word lightly, if ever), and my friend's dish was great, too.  The best part though, was when our server played a little joke on us to cheer us up. We had a good rapport going by then, so she knew we would appreciate it. To give some context: One of the complaints I had vented about the previous restaurant we'd visited, was that I had ordered wings, and was told I would be charged if I wanted carrots and/or celery with them (which is absurd for a wing place!). So, when we were eating, a server who had not waited on us brought two little condiment cups and sat them down on the table. Immediately after, another server who had not waited on us, brought two little condiment cups and set them down on the table, too. Lastly, our server brought... Yep, you guessed it: two little condiment cups and set them down on the table. I looked into the cups, and each one contained a single baby carrot.  The moment I realized what was going on, I burst into laughter, and once my friend caught on, we were in stitches. The servers who were in on it were all giggling too. It was the most unexpected, funny, and somehow caring gesture I have ever had dining out. I had been so upset earlier that night, and by a fluke we ended up at Applebees with the best server in the entire world, eating amazing food, nearly crying with laughter. I thought it was so cool how the servers (even the ones who had not been our waiters) banded together to cheer us up, and still managed to be courteous, attentive, kind and professional to every person in the place. My friend and I both decided that we would try to give her as close to a 100% tip as we could between us - and if my bank account had allowed it, I would have tipped more. It was a special experience I will not soon forget - and I will be telling everyone about it.  I have had exceptional customer service experiences each time I have visited this Applebee's location - no matter what, they always make it right. And sometimes, you get someone really special like Brittany who goes above and beyond. I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,
23,Tim D.,"Spokane, WA",0,1,,1.0,2016-09-23,"One star is too generous!!! The worst experience ever at this Applebees and we have frequented this location often. Our waitperson was Amber.  Placed our order and waited 40 minutes for food.  When food arrives we did not have silverware.    Breaded fried chicken patty and mashed potatoes are not considered finger food.   Asked for silverware.  A few minutes passed and we were thrown 3 forks, 2 of which were dirty.   Asked for clean forks and knives but were told we could not have knives because they didn't have any.   5 minutes later we got the clean forks and they managed to find a couple knives.   No refills on drinks and our waitperson avoided us.  Requested boxes for leftover food and took 5 minutes to get those.  We told the waitperson about the poor service.  She offered to get the manager but the manager didn't have the guts to come out.   They did take a whopping 10% off the bill.   We will never visit again.  Lesson learned!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,
15,Brian S.,"Dallas, TX",5,28,1.0,5.0,2016-11-12,"I'll admit I'm writing this review in biased fashion. Went there for a free Veteran's Day meal and got the royal treatment. Ally, first of all, thanked my sister and I for our service and was immediately alerted that I was eligible for a free beer because of the charitable donations from other customers. Really cool thing they had going. So, regardless of their shortcomings any other day of the year, first impressions are lasting impressions. I last went in this location in 2009 when I was visiting, way before I moved here.

My wife saw an add on TV and online for a buy one get one meal for around $12.00.  Perfect.  We arrived at the restaurant and sat down but no mention of or menu showing this offer.  We wait about 10 minutes before the server finally arrives and we ask about the offer.  He says that he'll check on it and takes our drink order.  Iced tea and water.   Another ten minutes later he shows up with drinks and asks if we are ready to order.  We again ask about the offer and he says ""she didn't bring the menu?"", uh no she didn't.  Another 10 minutes and he brings the menu with the offer. Another 20 minutes and our meals are delivered by another waitress.   No check in by the waiter to fill my now empty iced tea.  Just as I was finishing my meal he finally shows up with a fresh iced tea that I would have loved quite a while before.  I wonder if we had ordered off the regular menu (full price) if we would have seen better service. As for the food we had the Fiesta Lime Chicken and Three Cheese Cavatappi.   Both were tasty but unfortunately spending a long evening with poor service overrode the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spokane-5,,,,,
