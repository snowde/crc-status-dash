14,Tara J.,"Syracuse, NY",0,32,2.0,4.0,2012-08-09,"Had a overall good experience, im on a low carb kick so i choose to have the chicken and shrimp with onions and mushrooms with a side of broccoli. My dinner was very good and filling--decent size chicken and 6 shrimp came out on a sizzling plate. I had a quarter of the chicken left  when i was full. My Bf had a chicken wrap that was good and a good size portion too.  When we were seated they had a flyer out on the table with drink specials- seem like good specials BUT you have to be sitting at the bar area to get the specials....??!!!???Our waitress confirmed this. Why put the flyer out on the tables if you cant get the drink specials.?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
13,Audrey B.,"Hamilton, NY",19,15,27.0,5.0,2013-07-09,Another great yelp! Had the chicken finger basket! Yummy!!  Waiter was absolutely fantastic. He got a very good tip :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
11,Kathleen W.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,299,110.0,1.0,2013-08-29,Had a horrible experience this location. Food came cold. We had a gift card that was not honored despite having just called to make sure it was still good. Finally got a manager to see that the gift card was still active and covered the bill. Never returned.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
12,Chris D.,"Syracuse, NY",191,42,31.0,3.0,2013-12-14,Brought my girlfriend here for a quick lunch while shopping. We ate the cowboy burger an quesadilla burger. The French fries and mash potatoes were delicious. The burgers were slightly overcooked and pretty greasy. All together they are a safe bet but if you know your way around town there are better options.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
16,Roz O.,"Fairfield, CT",21,3,3.0,1.0,2014-03-29,"First off, their ""carside to go"" service was the worst. I arrived slightly late not wanting to wait there for my order to be cooked but ended up sitting in my parked car anyway for over 5 minutes. Finally I got out of my car and went into the restaurant and my order  was just sitting there on the counter while the person working this area took someone else's order for another 5 minutes. Horrible. The manage was apologetic, but I had a coupon for the meal so what were they going to do for me? The food was not good and the portions skimpy! I will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
17,Alicia G.,"Fayetteville, NY",55,2,,2.0,2014-08-17,Got seated pretty quickly but after that did not see a server for about 15 minutes. We ordered and didn't get our drinks for another 10 minutes. The food finally arrived and was overcooked and we had no silverware. The server never came back to check on us. Overall a very slowwwww meal for ok food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
7,Kirk R.,"Syracuse, NY",44,151,79.0,3.0,2015-12-12,"Craptastic, I ended up at a different Applebee's just a few days after my Clay location's negative burger experience.  No, I'm not really a glutton for punishment . My wife got a $20 off coupon with a Delta Sonic car wash bundle.  Yay. This time I decided to step it up, and go for the 9 ounce house sirloin steak. Why. I read an article not too long ago about restaurants using this stuff called meat glue, to fashion fake cuts of meat out of surplus remnants. Sound delicious? I sort of suspect this is what's going on with the Applebees sirloin steaks. A spongy textured lump of brown flesh, the flavor is meatt, but it's definitely not a natural meaty flavor .   Instead of a vegetable I got a double serving of garlic mashed potatoes, which was a heaping helping of potato goodness. Unfortunately I can't speak so highly of the steak. The 9 ounces must be a pre cooking weight because this tiny turd of a steak was barely enough to get stuck in between my teeth. When I sawed it with their dull knife, it was a tough leathery baseball glove texture. YUM. Just as soon as I suspected, my teeth had to take a break halfway through every bite. I was disappointed in case you can't tell. Thankfully, the large portion of potatoes filled my gullet nicely, and my daughter was kind enough to leave some food on her plate, like she often does, and like the family dog I licked it clean. One more terrible review for Applebees. I pray I won't be patronizing them again anytime soon. When I do, and I'm sure at some point I will with my couponing wife, I'll give something made with chicken a try. They clearly suck at beef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
6,Nicole D.,"Syracuse, NY",22,14,2.0,3.0,2016-02-11,"Service was great and food was great. Our drinks were horrible. I ordered the new peach mint sangria. Bartender forgot the mint, pineapples and added two olives. I don't know what she made me but lime, orange, peaches and olives don't mix with moscato and peach schnaps. My kids flavored iced tea and lemonade also were not what we were used too. Bartender needs to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
10,Sarah K.,"East Syracuse, NY",23,3,,4.0,2016-05-24,"The staff is very nice, there are a few people whom seem a little rude. Food is good. Great vibes here! Sweet potato fries are amazing . Yum . I recommend Applebee's because it is family friendly. Great place to meet up with friends .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
3,Paul J.,"Syracuse, NY",1,12,19.0,4.0,2016-07-07,"Great atmosphere for family, friends and kids.  Sports are on the TVs. Wife and I had the 2 for $25 (2x salads and entrees) I had 4cheese Mac N cheese with honey chicken while wife had Bourbon Chicken and shrimp. Both were Delicious. And matre De gave me a Southern Tier glass to take home so.... Bonus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
9,Pa E.,"Napanee, Canada",0,55,,1.0,2016-10-17,"We ordered two steak meals and clearly asked for each steak to be well done. One steak arrived medium done, the other was completely raw in the middle and burnt on the outside.  A few years ago this restaurant was better. It seems when they are busy, they don't give a care what they serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
5,Elaine P.,"East Hampton, CT",0,4,,1.0,2017-02-19,The worst experience we have ever had. Complete chaos. It was not busy no wait to be seated. Our meal took well over an hour to come out. I could have dealt with that but no apology from the manager he didn't even stop by our table to apologize. Do not go here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
1,Sarah L.,"Oriskany, NY",104,198,185.0,1.0,2017-04-08,"It's not just this applebees, it's all Applebee's restaurants. The food is terrible even for a chain restaurant. I never settle for applebees. I'd rather get dinner at McDonald's before I come to an Applebee's restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
8,Michael W.,"Minoa, NY",0,24,,2.0,2017-05-02,My wife and I use to met with friends at this Applebee's.  For some reason the food quality seems to have gone down.  I was there last week and nothing changed.  I can't go back.  Too many other changes for the worse.  There are many other restaurants that offer better meals.    It use to be a great place to eat.  What happened????,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
0,William B.,"Baldwinsville, NY",37,64,10.0,5.0,2017-07-08,"A five is the call of the day. If yiu read my reviews, you know how oftennand how much I love burgers.  This burger was made perfect.  Although I asked for it to be well done, it was made well and still was tasty and juicy.  Perfect. My beer selection was Modelo on draft. My complements to the unknown chef.  I wish the staff would tell us who the chef was whi cooked the food so we could personalize the complements and increase his or her demand for more money. The bartender whi took my order was very good, too.  She displayed just the right touch of friendly. If you ever want a burger and a beer as I did tonight, the Applebees on Erie Blvd is a great choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
2,Katy K.,"Rensselaer, NY",0,8,,1.0,2017-10-08,"This Applebee's gave me the worst dining experience of my entire life. DO NOT EVER GO HERE. Go straight to Mcdonalds instead for the exact same entree. Never got water brought to my table, never got a refill on drinks, and the chicken was undercooked. You would think that with four tables in the restaurant we would at least get checked on once, but instead we had to freeze for over 2.5 hours. I'm appalled and will never ever go to another Applebees again. Couldn't even call customer service to complain because it's a Sunday and not ""regular business hours,"" so I guess their waiting staff was probably checked out with them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
4,Allia D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,3.0,2.0,2017-10-28,"we ordered the nachos, boneless bbq wings, chicken fingers, fiesta lime chicken, and a french onion soup and a brownie bite. i'm going to give 2 stars because im feeling nice today. after we finished our meals, my husband looked at me and said "".. want to know the best part of this meal? it was the ice water they gave us. best tap water i've ever had. nice and crisp with the lemon"" ... needles to say, we weren't impressed.. however, that brownie bite was fuego",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-syracuse-5,,,,,
