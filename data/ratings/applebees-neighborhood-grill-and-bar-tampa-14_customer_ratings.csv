12,Chris B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",23,4,3.0,2.0,2016-02-05,"Just went there tonight with a couple of friends and we were actually very surprised that there was a ""VJ"" from 93.3 there. It wasn't a pleasant surprise, but it's not the fault of the store that we didn't enjoy it. However, it is very odd to have any form of loud music in such a closed space. I suppose it creates more of a bar experience to bring in a younger crowd, being so close to the university. Above all else, my main complaints are about the food. How much can I expect from an Applebee's? How much can I expect from a Chili's or a TGI Friday's in general? As these restaurants all share the same characteristics in terms of quality and variety, I normally group these together. Come to think of it, I've never once thought to myself, ""Man, am I really craving [blank] from Applebee's,"" or ever thought about recommending it. Not only was the food lackluster, it was straight bad. The wings that I ordered had a decent at best honey barbecue glaze, but the main problem was that it tasted like it was mostly breading. Like they had retrieved old bones from the trash, breaded it again, and fried and glazed them. There was hardly any meat. The fries that my friend got with his burger had obviously been sitting out for awhile because they were lukewarm, dry, and chewy. Everything is really expensive considering the quality that you receive for your dollar. I'm not sure if it's the recipes that Applebee's provides or the management that makes it this way, but I am appalled that anyone with a sense of taste can enjoy a meal there. Perhaps they were busy, perhaps they were short staffed. I won't be returning to investigate any further. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.  The only thing they got right was the draft Yuengling. But even then, at 2 for 1, the beer was still about $6, which must have incredible margins seeing as how there's a factory just a few miles out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.024,3.0000000000000004

24,A H.,"Tampa, FL",0,8,,1.0,2016-11-25,"I used to visit this Applebees on a weekly basis during my college years. I can't say that I was picky about my food during that time. I would get one of the appetizers and a drink and call it a day. Seemed good to me during that time. However, during my most recent visits, I realized that the quality of Applebees consisting of the service and the food has significantly decreased. For example, I decided to treat my mother to Applebees during the 6:00 p.m. dinner service. We were promptly seated. Looking around the area in which my mother and I were sitting in, which consisted of about 6 tables there were napkins, crayons, silverware, crumbs, and bite size pieces of food all over the floor. It certainly was not busy considering that only two tables were occupied in my section. The party directly across from me ordered hot water and soaked their silverware in it. This is just to give you an idea of how dirty the area was.  I ordered the mild boneless chicken wings as an appetizer. I don't understand how something could have looked so unappetizing. I understand that chicken wings are just glorified chicken nuggets, but all the cooks did is cook a bunch of small boneless chicken wing pieces and tossed them in the sauce. I also ordered the Signature Sirloin w/ Garlic Herb Shrimp. I couldn't even finish the entire meal. The cheese on top of the sirloin was so overpowering. It ruined the flavor of the steak and looked really gross. My mother ordered the double crunch shrimp. It seemed to be the only appealing thing that we ordered, so I just ate some of her food.

7,Miriam A.,"Thonotosassa, FL",1,11,2.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"Every experience has been a bad 1- THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED ANYWHERE. I'm  so upset by the service I've received from this Apple bees. This is not the first time but is the worst time. My order was extremely late, my burger was not made as I requested, my fries were stale and cold and the extras I paid for were forgotten. This was a take out order so after all the other mistakes I came home to realize my extras that I paid for had been forgotten. I did ask to speak to the manager when I was there but was told I would have to wait around 20minutes. Don't waste your money or time here. It is to ghetto I also witnessed a table walk out without paying. & heard this happens many times. So why would this Apple bees care with constant costumers likes that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
1,Teneisha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,16,14.0,4.0,2017-10-11,I had a great experience here! I was visiting from California and the manager went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of. Danielle our server made us these custom drink they make at the Applebee's back home. The food had a few issues but they were fixed in a very timely manner. Thanks guys.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
3,Shane I.,"Riverview, FL",10,10,9.0,1.0,2017-11-21,"I walked in and was seated fairly quickly maybe 2 min wait. Since then it's been 22 minutes and there still hasn't been a server to my table. I've seen a girl walk by 4 times and as I say excuse me she just keeps waking by as if I didn't say anything, despite serving the tables on both sides of us. Absolutely uncalled for. I have been in food service for almost 20 years and there is no excuse for this!!!! I would add a pic but my table is bare as I'm still waiting as I write this. Should I have gone elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
6,Amber T.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-09,Service was terrible waited 30 min for a menu and didn't even acknowledge us until I said where is our server. Didn't even ask or serve us utensils or water. With 5 hungry angry kids it is very frustrating to wait for drinks and food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
