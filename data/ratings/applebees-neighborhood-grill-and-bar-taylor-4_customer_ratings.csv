22,McKenzie P.,"Rockdale, TX",0,14,,2.0,2014-06-01,"We just came home from eating here, and needless to say, we were very disappointed. First of all, when we got there, not only was it packed (as usual), but  it took quite awhile for us to be seated at our table. And when we were seated at our table, it took even longer for the waiter to come to us and give us our drinks (to give you an idea, it was long enough to where we already decided what we wanted to order). When the waiter FINALLY came to us, we took our order. I ordered the appetizer trio (with the pretzel sticks that came with a cheese sauce, a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and ""quesadilla"" towers), my Dad also ordered the appetizer trio (with the spinach and artichoke dip, ""quesadilla"" towers, and ""wings""), my brother ordered a burger, my Mom ordered what were supposed to be fajitas, and my little brother ordered a club sandwich. Now keep in mind that part of the reason the service was slow so far was because there was a rush (a baseball team came in, and the staff were stressed). But even then, this restaurant  should've been used to such a thing, especially since it's Applebee's. We did get our food faster than when we waited for our waiter. However, even then, things did not get any better (even though the rush was finally starting to die down). First of all, Mom's ""fajitas"" were not even fajitas at all- It was warm steak. It did NOT come out sizzling like it should've been. Cheese did come on the side, but the so-called ""fajitas"" were not even close to hot enough to melt the cheese. The only bright side to her ""fajitas"" was that Mom said they had an okay flavor. But for that price, they were most certainly not worth it. As for the rice that came on the side, Mom said that they were more like rice crumbles with, again, an okay flavor. My brother's burger didn't look too bad, although the patty was smaller than the bun. My brother did not say much about his burger- He implied that it was okay, but not something to remember. As for my appetizer trio, it wasn't bad, but it left quite a bit to be desired. The pretzel sticks were pretty good. The spinach and artichoke dip wasn't terrible, but not fantastic either- It could've used some things to help make it ""pop"". Perhaps some garlic would've helped. As for the ""quesadilla"" towers, on the other hand, they weren't like quesadillas at all. Ironically, they were very lacking in terms of cheese. Not only that, but I thought it tasted a bit vegetablely too, even though there was quite a bit of beef in there. I had to dip it in the cheese sauce in order to make up for the lack of cheese. The cheese sauce pretty much had to be the best thing on the plate- After all, who could mess up melted cheese? (Or what seems to be mostly melted cheese).  Now one thing I have to say... A small cup of salsa came with the ""quesadilla"" towers... IT WAS TERRIBLE! There was NO spice to it AT ALL whatsoever! It didn't even taste like much of any salsa. And if you're gonna come here to Texas, you better damn well know how to make salsa. It's pretty hard to mess up salsa, but these guys very clearly messed it up terribly. A small recommendation- Do NOT order ANYTHING that has their salsa on it. This has to be the WORST salsa I've ever eaten in my life. Now as for Dad's appetizer trio, he said that it was okay, but some of the stuff came out warm, but not hot. He did not say anything special about the ""quesadilla"" towers he had. He said that the spinach and artichoke dip was okay. However, the wings were missing. He did not get his wings until it was nearly time for us to go. And when he FINALLY got his wings, the wings were very small and wimpy. Not only that, but they fried the LIVING HELL out of those things! It was so fried to a crisp, that the chicken was dry as a bone. Oh, and did I mention that the sauce came on the side instead of on the chicken wings? My little brother's club sandwich might've been the best thing of all the meals we got. His only complaint was the bread- He said that the bread was crunchy and made his teeth feel sensitive. But aside from that, the club sandwich didn't sound too bad. As for the staff, all of them were stressed due to the rush and their having to frantically make the meals in a messy kitchen (the messy kitchen was due to the rush). When the waiter brought my Dad his wings, even he knew that the whole thing was a disaster. But it was not our waiter's fault for any of this, so we gave him a tip anyway. Overall, whoever is managing this place needs to clean up their act or they may find themselves out of business before too long. The food was not even worth the price either. Due to this bad experience, we will not be coming back to this place any time soon. The Whataburger across the street would've been a better option- Their food is both quicker and better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4?start=20,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

The food the last few months has been really good, however, the service has gone down like a plane losing fuel. Our last trip in we had a couple sitting across from us that spoke to the manager, Tony. We heard how Tony had only been there 2 days and was working on fixing some issues. Now let's fast forward to 3 weeks later. After sitting at our table for 5 minutes, another family came in, and their waitress came right over and took their drink and food order. At that point, the waitress walked away without even looking at us. I was done. We walked out. I turned around because I think the manager should know why he is losing my business. The waitress was talking to the hostess and shrugged her shoulders like she didn't care you lost business. I asked for the manager and she stated she was in her way over, she swears. She went to go get Tony the manager at my request. He walked up with his hands in his pockets. Not a great first impression. I introduced myself. I stated the issue and he said ""how about we not have a fit and come in and enjoy some food"".  He also stated he had only been there for 2 days and knew exactly what the issue was and he was working on it. Yeah, haven't heard that one before. I have been a loyal customer and this just lost you business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4?start=20,,,,,

The other 2 tables in there were looking around for her as well...table behind us waiting for a to go box for at least 10 minutes..

5,Mindy C.,"Fredericksburg, TX",1,32,10.0,1.0,2017-10-08,"First thing walking in, the hostess wasn't even pleasant... and apparently it was hard for her to put a high chair down by the table. Sit down at a dirty sticky table that was probably wiped with a dirty rag from 2 weeks ago. We go ahead and order. Get our appetizer and go to unwrap the silverware to find something black in between the slats. There were more so I chalked it up to being (hopefully) the only one dirty. Had my 9 year old check her silverware before she went to dig into the appetizer and low and behold a piece of lettuce or some other undesirable nasty food left on the fork. Couldn't do it. Asked for a manager and he was very understanding and didn't charge us for our meal that was coming out, as he was speaking to us. We informed him we would not be eating our order and would gladly pay for our appetizer and drinks we ordered, but he insisted that we didn't because ""dirty silverware is hard to get over"". What has happened to the pride in the workforce? I would be so ashamed if I was the owner of this restaurant. It was disgusting! Even the floor was nasty. I get people don't want to work but suck it up and leave your attitudes at the door and DO YOUR JOB!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
3,Marla D.,"Round Rock, TX",0,3,2.0,1.0,2017-10-17,"Dinner after a certain time in Taylor is limited, and we mistakenly chose to stop here vs the Whataburger Drive-thru.  We sat at the bar to make it quicker, but that was wishful thinking.  70 minutes with no one else in the restaurant getting food and we are still waiting on the check.  Had to get our own menus, silverware, and flag someone down for EVERYTHING!!  I would rather starve than come here again.  I'm glad they had a great time hanging out around a cocktail table chatting (manager included).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
0,Tonya B.,"Puyallup, WA",70,3,,4.0,2017-12-21,The last time I went to our local Applebee's the food was supremely sub par. But last night my partner and I needed food but it was late so we decided to give it another shot. Not only was the food great but the service was even better. One of the staff members even gave me her earings because I commented on how much I loved them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
1,Kristina M.,"Thrall, TX",0,10,,1.0,2018-01-04,"A very disappointing experience.  Told after we ordered that kitchen was backed up; soup arrived lukewarm after along delay; was told after that (about 30 min) the item ordered was not available (nor several of the secondary choices); food finally arrived but 10 minutes apart for each of us; meat was dry and overcooked; items not prepared as menu described (missing several elements in both orders); manager never visited to discuss; server mentioned discounted off the original item ...I would expect not to be charged for something I didn't receive - that's not a ""discount"".  Each of 3 visits in the last three years has been like this.  Well past time for corporate intervention.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-taylor-4,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
