It doesn't matter what part of the country I go they are just not what they used to be. For starters, they changed the menu several times, making the portions smaller and smaller every time. The quality is not what it was once upon a time. We order our classic spinach and artichoke did and boneless chicken. The chicken was cold when it arrived, and the size of the spinach dip was half of what it used to be. The service was great, the bartender waited on our table during reverse happy hour, he was attentive and prompt. It is not his fault for the screw ups in the kitchen. Our mixed drinks were about the only thing that was good about our meal. The perfect margarita was perfect (considering others always screwed up in Easton, MD) I didn't have to question the bartender on what he added he followed the recipe to the T.

113,Mike M.,"Phoenix, United States",8,32,24.0,1.0,2015-04-19,"Why is every place going downhill? When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order. Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get... We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward. Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample. The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there... We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell. So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home. We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order.

10,Natalie L.,"Chandler, AZ",55,15,,1.0,2015-09-18,Such a bummer that I have to change a review from really good to bad. On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.

120,Natalie L.,"Chandler, United States",55,15,,1.0,2015-09-18,Such a bummer that I have to change a review from really good to bad. On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.  I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min.

The flavor is is great and consistency is for the most part there. This time we also had a loaded brisket enchilada and that was decent. They give you enough meat to keep you satisfied, comes with rice, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, etc. Yea we went full Mexican for this lunch.

We had a long wait for our food and the party of 3 people had got so tired of waiting, they left. He didn't get to introduce himself or get their drink orders! After a long wait, we finally got our food! But one thing was missing... my moms margarita. He ""forgot"" about it. The food was worth waiting for! It was delicious! When ready to leave, I asked for my check. I hand him cash. He came back and handed me a bag for my boxes but had not given me back my change. Maybe he ""forgot""...

Two parties are then seated on Kyle's side, one party with 3 people and another with 6. Kyle then takes our order perfectly . My mom orders a margarita. So far, so good. We had a long wait for our food and the party of 3 people had got so tired of waiting, they left. He didn't get to introduce himself or get their drink orders! After a long wait, we finally got our food! But one thing was missing... my moms margarita. He ""forgot"" about it. The food was worth waiting for! It was delicious! When ready to leave, I asked for my check. I hand him cash. He came back and handed me a bag for my boxes but had not given me back my change. Maybe he ""forgot""... The change was well over 25% and was not well deserved. I understand if someone says ""keep the change"" but I did not and was expecting to leave the right deserved tip.

Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10.... I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, ""delicious"", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind.. HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!  So I went to Applebee's down the street.  On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!  They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry.

20,Scott G.,"Chandler, AZ",85,21,5.0,5.0,2017-08-04,"This review is for you if you often find yourself looking for decently priced sit-down style dining in the late evening... Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10.... I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, ""delicious"", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind.. HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!  So I went to Applebee's down the street.  On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!  They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry. At 10:00 the entire restaurant was busy and provided a great vibe. Food deal was amazing for the price.  Applebee's should be a go to for so many.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7,2.32,2.35,2.35,,2.338

I had not been to Applebees before & thought we will try it out as I had a Gift Card. There were so many booths & tables open & the person who seats the guests is looking around for a table while stand there. Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all. I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything. I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland. I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing.  If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it. He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point? Did the Manager have the artichoke the chef forgot to add? This is my first time there & it will be my last for sure.

Food: 4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken tenders - 3 people ordered this on at our table and everyone loved it. it's usually what i get here but wanted to try something else. i recomend this dish! its delicious mac and crispy tenders definitely satisfy and leave you wanting more chicken strips! i had a crispy chicken breast on mashed potatoes and gravy topped with onion strings. it was fantastic, flavors all over the place delicious and savory. i w2ould get again. wife had a steak - was way over cooked and tasted of burnt grill flavor - i don't think she would recomend getting it again. we had a good experience. this was a good middle of the road not to pricey great place to have lunch. good for kids and the whole family.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7,2.12,2.36,2.36,,2.2640000000000002

For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol.
