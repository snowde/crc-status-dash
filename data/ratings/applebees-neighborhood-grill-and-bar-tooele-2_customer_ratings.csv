Although I was not very pleased after she ID me for my beer that then I was ID again (as she forewarned) by a rude manager,  before he even looked at my ID (which I am 45) said ""are you planning on eating?  I am holding the lunch menu at a booth with 2 others. Obviously I was there for lunch, if wanted to just drink beer Tooele has several ""bars"" in town that  I would much rather buy  and drink beer from. I really am not going to Applebees and sit at a booth with my 72 year old mother and 43 year old sister to ""drink beer"" SERIOUS!!!! He came across as  rude and unprofessional, with the way he handled the apparent ""required by law"" of beer sale.  So after twice showing ID to the 2 separate people, it was another 17 minutes before receiving my barely cold bottle of Budweiser. What made it worse was this rude, unprofessional manager barely looked old enough to be selling beer in the first place. again the embarrassed server we had was exceptionally good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tooele-2?start=20,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804,1.804

22,Corban A.,"Tooele, UT",6,23,,1.0,2015-05-07,"What is it with the overzealous carding of ID's for people who want an adult beverage? We got carded twice by two different staff for the drinks we ordered with dinner. The manager then came around and was going to card us a third time (he was carding a table next to us again) and I said we were walking out the door if we got carded a third time. I saw the sign on the table saying be prepared for harassment if you want a drink, I get it but carding people multiple times by multiple staff for the same drinks is downright absurd.

29,Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,5.0,2015-06-10,"Can't say enough about how great the service was from food server Lewanna! We had a family reunion of sorts and we chose Applebee's because we love the food. On this visit we received excellent service. I know Applebee's is kind of like a sports bar where they keep the music loud to ""create"" excitement, however our reunion was filled with conversation and we really wanted to just hear each other talk and enjoy a nice dinner. Some of us hadn't seen each other in years. Not only that, my dad and I were from out of state and we don't get to Utah very often to visit our family. I asked Lewanna if she could please turn down the music for awhile for us because we were having a hard time hearing each other talk. In the past, I've asked managers at restaurants to do this and was told that they couldn't do this! So, I was very pleased that she listened to my request. Our dinner was excellent, the food was fantastic (as always), but I was really impressed with Lewanna. Not just because she lowered the music volume for our table, but she was very attentive to our needs the entire time as well. I will keep coming back to this Applebee's and I will also recommend it to all my friends and family. Thanks again Lewanna for going above and beyond with such excellent customer service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tooele-2?start=20,,,,,

19,Virgil G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,19,,2.0,2015-08-14,"The food is average. The staff is friendly-ish and polite-ish, but try and get a cocktail there... I dare you. I did, and let me tell you something. Congress moves faster.  First I ordered. The. I was shown flash cards designated to educate me that I needed to order food in order to order a cocktail (That's a lot of ordering). Then to drive the point home, I was given a verbal quiz in reference to the flash cards to make sure I was paying attention. I passed with flying colors. Now you go through the interview stage. It's not sufficient for just your server to see your identification, but the lead server, assistant manager and the manager need to verify your age, eye color, hair color and your weight ( I have packed on a few pounds so there was a lengthy discussion of that was actually me in the ID photo). After the exams and the background check that would make the FBI proud you get to order....... And wait. And wait. And wait. It's kind of like waiting for your number to be called at the DMV, only your hungry....and thirsty. It took so long to get a sangria and a beer that I thought this establishment fermented their own wine and beer. After what seemed like a couple of birthdays, we finally got our drinks. Now it was time for the flash cards and oral exam for our food. Smh  All and all the place is average. If you order adult beverages, it's going to cost more than your meal. Two pints of Goose Island and that sangria cost close to 30 bones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tooele-2,,,,,

The food is served with no pride in appearance.  I have been there several times and usually there is something burned or not fresh, such as burned hamburgers or fries that were sitting out.  This is one of the few ""bars"" in Tooele.  I think they ride on that rather than serve good food.  Unfortunately, the drinks (liquor based) are watered down and overpriced. But, that is typical for Utah. Applebees should be ashamed of this place.  The people of Tooele deserve better.

11,Chris G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,22,17.0,1.0,2016-03-19,"Thinking of going here on a weekend night? DON'T DO IT! We made this mistake, and we had a terrible meal on a Friday night. Service is some of the worst I've had in a long time. I realize it's Applebee's, which is not a swanky place anyway, but I've recently had far better service in a GAS STATION, as opposed to this Applebee's. 45 mins after we were seated, we received our 1st (incomplete) round of sodas. Then, they brought out our salads and appetizers, but since we hadn't been given any silverware, some people chose to eat non-finger-food with their hands, and some of us waited. I asked our waitress FOUR TIMES over the next 10 mins for silverware! Finally, I was infuriated. and went to the serving station, and helped myself. On my way back, in an attempt to defuse my annoyance, our waitress mocked me for my initial attempt at eating my salad ""bird-style,"" without silverware. Having waited so long to eat our appetizers, because of the silverware situation, our entrees started arriving before we had a chance to eat the apps. Afraid of the inevitable service delay that would occur if we asked them to wait a few mins, we awkwardly shoe-horned the entrees onto our packed table. My Baby Back Ribs were truly the worst half-rack of ribs I've ever had. They were teeny! I'd estimate the length of the shortest rib to be about 2 1/2 inches long. (I wish I'd taken a pic!) They were almost devoid of actual meat, just sauce, bone, and connective tissue. (""Did anyone even feed this poor pig,"" I wondered?) Admittedly, my standards for good barbeque were recently expanded by my trip to Georgia, but these ribs honestly shouldn't impress anyone, regardless of exposure to real Southern food. I also had coleslaw that tasted like it came from a 5-gallon bucket, and about 20 fries. Sadly, the fries were the best part of the meal.  Summary: Go ANYWHERE ELSE - I'll never go back! I have been there several times before, and though not as bad as tonight, it's never been good, even on a sleepy Sunday afternoon. I honestly think I'd be embarrassed to work there, which may be why they were possibly short-staffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tooele-2,,,,,
