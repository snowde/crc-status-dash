19,Jennifer R.,"Torrington, CT",112,7,5.0,5.0,2012-02-19,"I dine here up to once a week, with family or friends.  The waitstaff is AMAZING, so friendly and SO good.  They are really good with substitutions or changes on the menu, so long as you ask.  If something isn't right with your meal, they take it back, and usually take it off the bill or discount the bill.  The manager, (Mark) is an awesome guy.   They recently re-modeled and the new appearance is so upbeat and local-friendly.  Check out all the Torrington High sports photos...I took them! I know this is a chain, and chain food can only be so good, but I give this one five stars for their awesome customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
16,Christie V.,"Watertown, CT",16,58,58.0,3.0,2014-07-15,"I stopped in for a lunch today and found many changes made in the restaurant compared to what I thought Applebee's was. They have new tablets to order off of, which I found did not work. I ordered my drink to be refilled and was never served a drink again... I was disappointed to see their new tablets offered games. It's like they were promoting families to embrace technology rather than have conversations at the dinner table. I found that upsetting especially their whole theme is neighborhoodsy yet they are promoting staring down at technology rather than striking up a conversation with the neighbor. Overall the food was mediocre, however I was surprised to find an affordable dessert option! A brownie bite for a $1! Finally a cheap and small version of dessert. Thank you for that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
11,Michelle R.,"Torrington, CT",5,27,16.0,5.0,2014-07-21,One of my favorite restaurants I don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant  The waitstaff is very friendly and they are always around to see if they can get you anything The food arrives fairly quickly and it's always exactly how we order it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,

21,Alex R.,"Vernon, CT",0,15,,1.0,2014-12-18,Ordered online and was given a pickup time of 6:15. Its now 6:50 and still waiting. How long does it take to make a salad?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3?start=20,,,,,
14,Ryan C.,"Goshen, CT",68,19,8.0,2.0,2015-03-08,"Friendly staff but falling very short on food quality and delivery of said food in a timely manor, waited 35+ minutes for breadsticks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
20,Richard M.,"Torrington, CT",0,2,,2.0,2015-04-26,"My wife & I decided to go to Applebee's the other day. It's been a couple of months since the last time we were there. What we had, was good. But, we were surprised by the prices. It seem they have really went up with their prices. What we paid, we could of went to any of our favorite restaurants, paid the same amount & received more for our money. Which what we will do from now on. We will never go back to Applebee's, because it's just not worth it for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3?start=20,,,,,
18,Victoria D.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,5,,2.0,2015-06-16,"Service was good! Food quality feel very short... Do not try the new brisket nachos , you'll be very disappointed their was maybe 2 small pieces of brisket total then just lettuce and chips. Then we got our meal my zucchini wasn't cooked and my portion size was super small.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
13,Patricia B.,"Torrington, CT",0,2,,2.0,2015-08-26,"I  have not been there in a long time &  now I  know why,  service is only OK, food isn't  much better than less expensive restaurants, plus they have shoved so many booths on  one side that they are not comfortable  I would much rather go to Chilis. Waitress was not very friendly, & servers called us guys(2 women & 1 man)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
7,Donna D.,"Bridgeport, CT",17,18,11.0,5.0,2016-06-04,Had another extraordinary amazing date night!!! Presentation and Taste of the food was impeccable.... our server Kayla was so sweet and very helpful with our food choices ....

10,Debbie L.,"Lake George, NY",2,8,,1.0,2016-07-09,"In town for camp visiting day. Took almost an hour to get served our food which was ultimately a mixture of a soggy overdressed salad ( which was supposed to have no dressing), over cooked meat and cold side dishes. Our waitress while apologetic, did not make any effort to compensate for her admitted poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
8,Lori V.,"Naugatuck, CT",42,73,73.0,2.0,2016-07-29,"Recently moved up to Torrington and finally decided to have a date night, so we chose Applebee's. Everything was going great, our server was Alexis and she was super nice. We order two appetizer, the wonton tacos and boneless wings. Appetizers came and one of the wings was 100% completely raw inside. After my husband bit down into he made the comment that it was ice cold only to spit it out and see a raw piece of chicken. Totally grossed us both out. Alexis came back and we brought it to her attention and she immediately brought the manager over. He gave us some speech about when they flip the baskets sometimes a piece flies out into the other fryer basket, said they were training someone new in the kitchen . Well tell them to be careful with raw chicken!!They took both apps off of our bill. Food was kind of tasteless and service was friendly. Don't think we will be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
12,Jane D.,"Encino, CA",0,19,,5.0,2016-09-08,"Last time I was in an Applebee's was the flagship one on 42nd St. several years ago.  Not for me, just average.  So I avoided them for a long time, until one rainy afternoon I stumbled into this one in Torrington.  Fabulous food, lovely staff, not a thing to complain about.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely come to this Applebee's again! [probably not the NYC one] ENJOY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
5,Matin D.,"Torrington, CT",0,3,5.0,1.0,2017-01-03,"Most recent visits on 12/24 & 1/2/17 left much to be desired. Service was poor at best, food took forever and was overcooked.  My husband had the ""nerve"" to question our server about the status of an appetizer which took nearly 25 min to receive - in a virtually empty restaurant.  The delightful response from our server was that ""it will be out when it's done cooking"".  Being a classy couple & having our young children  with us, we refrained from reacting to the sassy, snotty response. The breakfast burger ordered medium was crispy, egg burned and hash brown unrecognizable.  We are locals & this is a convenient spot for a meal. Two strikes, third....you're out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
6,Bob B.,"Ocean City, NJ",7,11,1.0,1.0,2017-02-02,"Horrible!!! I had the butchers meat and potatoes and it was like eating a TV dinner. The meat tasted as if it was frozen,the portion was small the gravy was almost nonexistent. Service was good but all in all it was terrible. Don't waste your money",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
9,Diana N.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,1,,5.0,2017-02-12,"Great food along with great service thanks to Jacob! Will be coming back! Applebees seriously saved our night, open until 11 Sundays is a god send! Service with a smile, even late on Sundays, haven't met a better server! Not only that but the late night happy hour is phenomenal!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
3,G.w. S.,"Colebrook, CT",65,5,1.0,2.0,2017-04-02,"Server Sierra was kinda snooty and only started being nice and smiling when it was time for the tip. I saw the other servers being friendly! Menu and drinks menu were filthy. The bill pad was greasy and disgusting as well. Garlic green beans were not garlicky.  Firecracker shrimp were not spicy and the pasta was bland. Steak & mashed potatoes were good, though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
4,James C.,"Canton, CT",0,18,4.0,5.0,2017-06-21,As with all chain restaraunts some locations are better than others. This location is definitely our go to spot while in the area. Service is always great and the 2 for $20 deals are unbeatable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
2,Tricia B.,"Goshen, CT",31,179,228.0,2.0,2017-07-01,"Eating out in Torrington, I find, is a struggle. Especially when it's after eight, your options are limited.  If you're looking for an experience with good food, good service, and a reasonable in and out, this is probably not the place for you.   I take no issue with the hygiene of the location, although I didn't go into the bathrooms.  The food was fine, but really just standard Applebee's fare.  The chicken was a bit rubbery, but perfectly edible.  The food is what it is. I suppose my ultimate issue is the service.  I was there on a Tuesday night, which is apparently trivia night, which is fine if that's your purpose.  The restaurant seems to be more than happy to let you sit there and drink (preferably from the bar), submitting trivia answers at a rate of one every three minutes.  People seemed like they were having a lot of fun, and again, if that's your objective, then that's awesome and I'm sure you'll have fun.  Not so much if you're there because you actually want dinner.  We ordered from the two for twenty, which I'm sure makes servers grimace inside calculating tips, and a water and coffee for beverages.  We were about midway through our appetizer when our entrees arrived, and were pushed directly in front of us.  Convenient in a way, but impractical if we wanted to, you know, finish the appetizer.  Once we were finished dinner we elected to have dessert, even though our waiter seemed resolute in his ability to ignore our table.  I get it, the table of people in their twenties ordering drinks are more fun and bigger bill.  But come on, did it really have to take twenty minutes after we told you we wanted a dessert AND another server overhearing me say, ""Why doesn't this stupid machine call the server"" for you to come back?  I lost track of how many times the server walked past out table to go check on someone else, and in the meantime, it does get a bit annoying having your dirty plates just kind of sitting there.   I swear, I am not that person who expects everything done perfectly, everything done immediately, and I don't mind waiting.  I do mind being ignored, and my suspicion (as I've stated above) is that other tables are more lucrative.  But maybe Applebee's dramatically under-staffs for what they actually need on Tuesday.  I don't know, which is why I'm not calling any person out by name.  My take away from the experience is there are other places to go where it doesn't take over 90 minutes to get in and out.  To the trivia teams, best of luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
1,K M.,"Plantsville, CT",0,43,4.0,1.0,2017-12-19,"So gross. My expectations were low, but the food was inedible. Double crunch ""shrimp"" was grey and soggy.  Apps weren't cooked all the way (cold) and too salty. Service was slow and bathroom was disgusting. Looks like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile. Overall, seems poorly managed. Won't return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,,,,,
0,Allie G.,"Canton, CT",124,69,46.0,5.0,2017-12-31,"Just left Applebee's and we had a really nice time. Our waitress Brittney was amazing. Normally I hate Applebee's because the food is just very generic but the reason it's getting a 5 Star review is because our waitress was so great. We got drinks and apps and we were slightly needy but she didn't mind. My boyfriend loved his all day brunch burger. He said it's his go-to burger here. I had the honey bacon chicken Mac and cheese. My chicken was really good, the pasta and sauce was just ok. Our drinks were good and we even got some meals to go. All together with three drinks, three appetizers, and three meals all for 58 bucks. That's honestly a steal. Not to mention we had such a nice time. Like I said before I usually stay away from Applebee's but this experience just might have changed my mind entirely!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-torrington-3,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
