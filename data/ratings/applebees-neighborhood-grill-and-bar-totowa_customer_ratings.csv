62,Dexter V.,"Bloomfield, NJ",696,440,3158.0,1.0,2012-01-21,"This review is based on a recent visit and first impression. Even though the restaurant is nearby, I have never eaten there. This particular visit was my first and will be my last. The restaurant was dirty, the waiter was nowhere to be found, and most importantly the food was salty! The waiter came to take our orders and dropped-off the check at the end. In between he was nowhere to be found. My party of six and I asked other waiters for assistance. Some food was salty, some sour, and some bland according to others in my group. For my part all of the appetizers that I ordered were salty; almost to the point of being inedible. To top this awesome experience off my group was seated at the smallest table possible and when we asked if we could sit somewhere else the hostess said we would have to wait longer because they were busy.

One of my friends complained about the mozz sticks in our sampler platter being cold, so our waiter got us a whole order freshly made. I was afraid our entrée was compromised because it didn't come out yet.  Our entrees looked and tasted alright.  My friend's mom paid for dinner but I offered to leave the tip. I tipped extra because my friend was a real a-hole on how he milked the system. We had extra mozz stick, so he ripped it into little piece on to his mash potato hoping it would melt and become cheesy potatoes.

38,Brian F.,"Little Falls, NJ",45,25,6.0,1.0,2016-03-05,"Racism does indeed come in all colors. We arrived at 5pm on Saturday night and there were several people waiting ahead of us. I told them we had a party of 5 and we were told the wait was 15 minutes. I am white, my wife is Asian, the host was African-American and there were three African-American waitresses standing nearby. Just after we came in a party of 7 - all African-American checked in and I heard one tell the other the wait was 25 minutes. Then two more parties came in and put their names on line - one a group of 4 the other a group of 5, both groups were all African-American. That is where it started getting weird. The party of 7 that came in AFTER us were called ahead of the last group that was waiting BEFORE we came in, a group of 7 or 8 Asian women. Those women were called next but then they called the group of 4 African-Americans that had come in after us. I then went and complained about them serving groups that had come in after us while we were still waiting. The host told me they were saving a corner table for us because we had small children and the table was being cleared. Not two minutes later they called the group of 5 African-Americans who had come in after us and led them right to the table he just told me was being saved for us. There were no children in their group. I complained again and he first said his screen wasn't working, gesturing to a screen very plainly working. I then told him screen or no screen he had just told me the table he was now giving away was for us. He told me ""I can't help what other people do"" whatever that means but I then asked for the manager at which point a waitress - African American - stepped in and said ""I'll just take them"". She led us past one empty booth to a second empty booth and finally sat us. I believe word was passed to the kitchen because the food was horrible. Here is a picture of my son's chicken fingers and fries. When you can count the fries - 14 - that is pretty meager.

I would have kindly asked for it to be cooked longer but he waitress was no where to be found after serving our food until probably 30 minutes later. I ordered another round of drinks before our food came out from the ""presto"" machine on the table but never received them. (On a side note I find it ridiculous you charge $2 to play the trivia game on that machine but that's really beside the point, I guess it's just another way to make a buck). At the end I asked to have my steak wrapped up and the waitress looked confused as to why I hadn't eaten it. I told her it was undercooked and she offered taking it back, after everyone had eaten. She showed us how to pay on the presto machine and we never saw her again. The presto machine automatically added 20% tip to our bill with a choice to lower the percentage which I did. I tip based on service received, not on the meal itself, and our waitress was kind but never checked on us, she got us drinks, didn't even bring our food, and showed us how to pay on the machine, and I'm supposed to tip her 20%? Why? They made the entire experience almost free from human contact. So silly.

I Literally spit the rubbery and fishy tasting Salmon out on the plate it was so bad, then Francisco asks me if I would like to take it home along with the second entree that arrived 10 minutes after the first because it was wrong and they had to remake it.  After spending an hour waiting for two entrees after two appetizers that came out wrong and disgusting we just wanted to leave.  It was not busy and there was no wait.  My daughter literally walked out of the place!  Everyone blambing each other for everything....  had the female manager that resolved the situation been the first one we talked to, I would have never left this comment. I had been here last year and everything was great.  He even tried to charge me for Salmon I spit out after leaving me a take-home container on the table.  Because the other manager was so understanding I'm not going to mention anything else here.

I waited for the server to let her know, she was so rude saying ""well how do you want it then?"" I didn't want my brother in laws to have a bad time so I stayed calm while she whipped the plate away and stormed off. I waited over half an hour for her to come back. She then made me cut into the steak while she watched to tell her it was ok. I've never experienced this kind of hostility from a server. Everyone had finished their meals when she eventually came back with my food. Not once did she come by to check on us or offer us any more drinks. Dirty plates were left on the table.

Applebee's is my go to place if my friends and I cannot decide where to eat and do not want to spend to much money. One major draw is the late night half off appetizers that start at 10. Applebee's has some delicious appetizers, particularly the beer pub pretzels. They are even more delicious when they are half off! The restaurant can get crowded during dinner and late night so anticipate a wait, especially on the weekends.  I have never had the drinks but the Oreo milkshake is from the bar and I know that is delicious! The servers are always friendly and efficient. They are particularly good at giving refills before you even ask! The restaurant is very loud and crowded at times.

Then when our food came out my Boyfriends steak was definitely rare and he ordered medium, which happens sometimes but then when our waiter asked us if everything is good my boyfriend said ""No, my steak"" and the waiter cut him off and said one second. Finally after going to 3 other tables he came over and took the steak to be cooked more. When he came back with it you could tell that it was  microwaved and it wasn't even cooked anymore!

The drinks were good and fresh and strong and the bartenders always will be on point(Shout out to Lady!). The kitchen stays open late like 2am late (yay!) but your food will never be hot(I deal with the heat lamp warmth). It's really the only thing open with semi- decent food at when I get off work late. Half off appetizers never hurt anyone and add to why I come here.

I always ask the waiter for ranch instead of blue cheese and they always forget it, I'm used to it, so when I got the blue cheese, I was fine with it. I just waited for the waiter to let him know I needed the ranch. That wasn't the problem, the problem was that the waiter argued with me insisting that what I got was ranch, when it was freaking blue cheese! I know the difference, trust me, they've screwed up my request every single time so I know the difference. Then, they forgot my beer. Whatever, it's fine I can live without the beer. The waiter comes at the end with my beer and says he forgot the beer. Okay cool, I understand, it's Saturday night and busy. I was already a little irritated with the whole ranch situation but whatever, we can move on. But it wasn't over. He comes over with the check and I noticed he charged us full price for the apps. So I addressed  him he says, half price apps are after 10. Every Applebee's I've been to starts half price apps after 9:30. And if it was the case that half price apps started after 10, why would you not tell us when we first place the orders. Not wait until the end when you give us the check.
