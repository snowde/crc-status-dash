51,David V.,"Lawrenceville, GA",19,21,1.0,1.0,2012-01-14,"Wish I could do no stars. The chips were soaked in grease. When I bit into them oil literally squirted out of them. The waiter said ill get you another coke, then he went and was talking with his buddy for about 10 minutes before bringing me a soda. My friend sat with an empty drink for about ten minutes and was not offered a refill. The food was bad the service was worse. This is not my first time having a bad experience at this location. It will be my last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3?start=40,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001
56,Mo G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",3,8,,1.0,2012-01-28,"So I came to this Applebee's (4353 Lawrenceville Hwy, Tucker Ga)on 1/27/12 with a friend to unwind and have a good time. I have been to many different Applebee's in the past with no issues whatsoever. I ordered a ""Mucho Mama"" (alcoholic beverage), and to my disappointment, the drink did not deliver. I did not taste a hint of alcohol. It tasted as though someone just mixed orange juice with cranberry. At this point, I got Gabrielle's (server) attention and explained to her that I was unsatisfied with the drink. She then informed me she would have to contact her manager before removing the drink from the table. That was no issue - the issue arrived once the manager arrived, Jarrett. I have never in my life experienced the lack of professionalism in a restaurant from a ""manager"" as I did tonight! He comes to the table looking uninterested as he asks ""How may I help you?"" No smile on his face. I then informed him that I did not like the drink at all (mind you, I had only taken a sip from it). He then tells me that ""I can take the drink from the table, but you will still have to pay for it."" At this point, I am looking at him in shock. I follow up with ""So you're telling me that if I don't like something that I did not drink, I still have to pay?"" His response - ""Yes"". I follow this up with ""So you're telling me if I didn't like this food, I would still have to pay?"" His response - ""Yes."" At this stage, I am livid. I am in disbelief at his tone, and his nonchalant attitude in not making the customer happy! Not once did he apologize, nor offer me an alternative option to try another drink. I wouldn't have wanted another option anyway, but just knowing the proper protocol of how managers usually handles situation of such put me in an uncomfortable situation dealing with him since he did the total opposite. I have been to many Applebee's before and in the past requested for an item to be taken from my bill due to dissatisfaction. Not once was I ever told NO. Clearly he could see how unhappy I was with what just transpired, because at this point, I asked for his boss's information. He gave me the business card for Alex, who is the general manager. Guess what? Not only did he just walk away after giving me the card, he didn't give a damn! Before my friend and I left, we requested to see this Jarrett character again. He came back to the table and my friend voiced her disappointment in the establishment and his attitude/approach. He then had the audacity to ask what could he have done to make himself more approachable to the situation -- Really? Our SERVER had compassion and empathy for my feelings, while the MANAGER had none! Jarrett then tries to explain himself ""My BOSS has told me to not take anything off of a bill due to the costs that were included in making it. It is a tough job to tell customers, but it's what my boss has asked for. Its products that are used and that is money."" I could have laughed in his face at this comment. Is he serious? If Applebee's has bosses that are telling their managers to run their business as such, you will have NO CUSTOMERS. I cannot believe that a boss would inform the manager to pretty much forget the customer's feelings and only worry about making money. You luck out on making money from that customer in the end because they will never go back to your establishment. So before he left the table, he let us know that he was ""Sorry we didn't enjoy ourselves."" You can imagine what I wanted to say to him but I refrained. I am appalled and disguisted. In the end, Gabrielle apologized and I asked her if this was the usual protocol - the manager refusing to take items off the check for unsatisfied customers. She said it's at the manager's discretion & they usually ask the bartenders if the drink was made right. Umm excuse me? I don't care if the bartender is asked how they made the drink - I care about how it tastes to me! A bartender is not perfect! Also, what may taste good to one person, may not taste good to the next. I am upset at this visit to a T. I had to pay for something I never drank, nor liked, all while feeling unimportant to the Applebee's franchise as though I wasn't a valued customer. I wasted my time even stepping foot in this Applebee's. Does the customer matter at Applebee's? That is the question that has been on my mind after this horrible visit. I have never been to a restaurant to where they refused to take an item off the bill, and not even offer another option from the menu. I wasn't given a choice at all. I will tell people to steer clear of this Applebee's!! The manager should be replaced! This is unacceptable!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3?start=40,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001
40,Annie K.,"Saint Louis, MO",49,100,83.0,1.0,2012-04-27,"The food is, alright. It's Applebees, so not much is expected. But the service, I give it 1 star only because I can not go with a - score.  As soon as I was seated, the waitress was on me asking of I was ready to order. I ordered an unsweet tea (I know, I do get odd looks in the South when I order tea that lacks sugar) and told her I'd told her I'd need a couple minutes for my food order. She did not return for almost 15 minutes with my drink. I ordered my food and it arrived 18 minutes later. The au jus and meat on my sandwich were barely warm. I ate my food, the waitress never returned to see how my food was or to refill my tea. When she did bring me a fresh tea, it was sweet, gag me southern sweet, no offense to those who enjoy sweet tea. She did not remove the dirty dishes from my table.  She, along with the several other members of the staff were to busy to wait on the whopping full house of 7 customers as they were busy playing and being rowdy at a table by bar, the horrendous rap music was quite load and some were dancing to or writhing in pain from it, or the food, not sure on that. But pained looks were on their faces.  As usual, I should have avoided the dreaded Applebee's and gone, instead to TGIFriday's. I never expect top shelf service from any Applebee's, but this was as low on the rung as you can go. Without competition for the worse service I have ever received at one of the restaurants  Heck, I had to go to the bar when my hunt for my waitress proved a fools journey. Of course, I was fool for staying past when my tea arrived in such a s-l-o-w manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3?start=40,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001
43,Dom P.,"Lilburn, GA",0,9,,1.0,2012-08-15,"This place was good maybe pre-2010, every time we have gone here afterwards was a disaster. The last time me and my family were here, our waitress had seated us and said ""I'll be with you in a minute"" which is normal, it happens, but she didn't return for another 20 minutes, mind you the place wasn't crowded at all, instead we just sat there with nothing on the table for 20 minutes, and where was our waitress? busy talking to the couple 2 booths behind us about hair or something. I assumed that the people she was waiting on had started the convo, but at some point you have to disconnect from them.  So once we actually got our drinks and ordered our food, the drinks (including the sprite) had zero taste, the chips from the artichoke dip had little taste, the food was so gross, I had the philly cheesesteak sandwich and it look like it had been sat on, all happening in between the times the waitress is still being held up by those people behind us trying to hold a conversation. Long story short, we were there for two and a half hours basically wating on service, food, and drinks that tasted bad, our waitress even talks trash about the new cook (which makes the situation worse, not better hun) and the manager had to take my sandwich away because of the travesty of the look and taste. I will never come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3?start=40,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001,1.1560000000000001

19,Ebony C.,"Alpharetta, GA",60,379,532.0,1.0,2013-08-31,"Went here to support a neighborhood establishment and watch the SEC football season opener this past week with my fave guy friends. They were at the bar and we had to move to a high top table, and the bartender Sarah H, gave us the most nasty attitude-ridden service I've ever experienced. She  took over 30 minutes to bring the check and told us that someone else would serve us. We then asked for the check to be split, and she never came back... literally.  No other waiter ever came to our table to take our orders, to give us silverware or even water--neither did Sarah. After sitting there like idiots for over an hour, my husband flagged down a DIFFERENT person to ask for the check from Sarah that we'd BEEN waiting on for about another 45 min at that point, and paid what he ran up at the bar before my arrival.  I'd never go back to this location, especially not to sit at the bar (my favorite thing to do at this Applebees) as long as she still works there. Totally unprofessional and uncalled for. My husband and his guy friends said she was being all flirty with them and then upon my arrival she turned into A NASTY LADY mode. Why act nasty bc I'm a female? What does have to do with the level of service you provide? She's sad and the service at a local place I've supported for 6 years is now TERRIBLE. management should be aware, that they are losing LOCAL repeat customers bc of their piss-poor staff. ... and NO the place was NOT busy nor was the bar full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3,1.092,1.092,1.092,1.092,1.092

38,Kendra K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,3.0,1.0,2016-02-28,"Last night I received the worst service that I have ever received in my life. From beginning to end the service was terrible. We went to Applebee's with a group of about eight people, it was around 11:45 at night so there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes for a host to even come to the front to put our names down on the list. Once they got us on the list  we were seated in about 15 minutes(not bad). Once we were seated our waiter came over within the first ten minutes (still not too bad) he brought us our drinks and took our orders, and then we didn't see or here from our waiter for another thirty minutes!!! We were thirsty and hungry so another waitress comes by and we ask her for refills on our drinks. Then our waiter finally comes back with some of our food. So everybody get their food EXCEPT for me. So while everybody else eats (including my three friends who came after me) I sit there and wait. My fiancé asks another waitress if she can check on my food because once again our waiter has disappeared into the abyss. Then our waiter finally comes back after another 30 minute absence and we ask him about my food and he says they're cooking it right now...So I waited another fifteen minutes for my food which was the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken. By the time my food came I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes! All the while everyone at my table is eating and begging other waitresses for refills because out waiter is nowhere to be found! This Applebee's has never had exceptional service, but we go there often because we know it's simple American style food that's inexpensive, but after last night I'm not sure we'll be going there anymore. Everyone in our party was pretty fed up and annoyed with the piss poor service that we received. I would not recommend you stop at this Applebee's, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that you can go to and receive better service!

I know they are slow to serve food and the quality is only so so,  That said, they are the only ones open late in the area, and sometimes that is what is needed.  This is the first review I've done though. Arrived at lunchtime in a party of 8, many tables available.  Our orders were taken in a timely manner.  Food service time good as well. Maybe the fact that I told the waitress we needed to be out by a certain time helped.   Quality:  2 people had ordered a combo with soup, both had to return the soup because it wasn't hot.  One said it tasted more like a marinara sauce than a soup.  Two people (myself included) ordered the Thai shrimp salad.  Not really impressed, and wondering what part of the salad was classified as ""Thai"".    Was also supposed to be drizzled with peanut sauce, missing on both.  The person that ordered coffee said it was not very good.  And lastly, one person who ordered a sandwich/salad combo described their caesar salad as ""greasy, with too much dressing"". Server:  Friendly.  One minor thing, she attempted to take orders without writing anything down.  Now some can do that flawlessly.  She, however, came back to ask what someone ordered because she forgot.  Honestly, I don't know why servers even attempt it, people don't tip better because of it. Value:  None.  Everything is overpriced, especially when compared with quality. Applebees seems intent on driving customers away.  From this point forward definitely going to try avoiding them as much as possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
1,Matthew P.,"Atlanta, GA",25,13,3.0,1.0,2017-11-22,"I've eaten at many different Applebee's in Georgia and around the southeast. The experience I had at this Applebee's was one of the worst. Start with walking in the door. We've arrived at the restaurant a little before 11 p.m. there were plenty of people there but we didn't see a single server. That should have been our first indicator to about face. Unfortunately, this area there's not a lot of late-night options so we decided to stick it out. Someone who seem like a manager came over and clean the table off for us but the floors under the table were disgusting. Again, planned to make the best of it. We placed our order with no notice the restaurant was out of anything. 10 minutes or more later the waitress returned to tell me they were completely out of steak of any size. They have 3 sizes on menu. Another 10 minutes later she returned to tell me that they did not have any thousand island dressing that and they did not carry it at the store. Meanwhile,  that dressing  had been listed off to me when I asked the waitress what dressings they had. I switched to a Caesar which took at least another 10 minutes to come out. When she brought out my salad she let my companion know that they had no bone-in wings so she also had to change her order as well. This is now 30 minutes or more after we placed our initial order!When the waitress brought out my salad I ordered the drink special Bahama Mama for $1. On the color poster it shows the drink in a beer mug. I was brought out a small 8 oz plastic cup. I complained, but was told that was the size they gave out. Any other Applebee's restaurants I have received the large size shown in the advertisement. When my ribs finally came out, half the order was cold. Also there were only 10 ribs(should be 12-13). The fire roasted vegetables that I had ordered were not only grilled instead of roasted but they included bell pepper which I wasn't notified of when I asked the waitress what that side included. I hate bell pepper.  We came in for a quick dinner and ended up being the restaurant for an hour and 40 minutes. With all the issues we had a manager never stopped by our table. I didn't bother to ask for one because given the state of the restaurant I don't imagine my feedback would have made any difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucker-3,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
