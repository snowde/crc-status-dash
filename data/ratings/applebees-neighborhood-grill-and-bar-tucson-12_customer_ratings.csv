59,Bernadette C.,"Tucson, AZ",40,72,83.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"The only reason I am writing this review is because of the great service I received the last time we went.  It was around 2pm, we were seated promptly. Then the waitress came to take our drink order. She was very friendly and talkative but not in an annoying way.  So a few minutes later our appetizer came, and we enjoyed it. Everything was freshly made. Then my husbands and my daughters food came and I was told it was going to be a few more minutes for my plate. I was ok with that since I was still working on the app. Not even a minute later the manager showed up and said that they had cooked the wrong entree and they had to start over on my plate. She apologized and said it was gonna be taken off the bill. It didn't bother me because my plate only arrived about 8 minutes after my husbands food.  We ended up paying about $15 for two entrees my daughters food and the app. and drinks. I thought it was nice that the manager went over and apologized because you dont normally get good service at applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12?start=40,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

When I did get the sandwich it was dry, and with the first bite the whole thing completely fell apart. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the beer was cold.

The kindness is extended in every mannerism of each worker (clearly working for tips,almost so much that it's insincere and annoying but hey whatever, you do you) my waiter was Chris, he rocked. Also Angel seemed to be new but he rocked too. Mega rocking going on in here.  Food quality -I got the cowboy burger and asked for no pink! But I got pink in my burger which still tasted fantastic but I just thought I should throw that out there. The Frys were over seasoned, I can feel the sodium levels in my body rising as I type this. Also, the oilfrom this burger dripped so extensively it took me 5 napkins just to continue soaking up, someone call the medics! But still delish and that's what matters here right!?  Overall, it's the closest Applebees to me so I myself here in the future of course. There was a guy there with a mustache that was about a foot long and part of it curled upwards all the way beneath his eyes!

34,Jon H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,1.0,2015-03-07,"We went to this particular Applebee's because we had been given a gift card.  I am a bit hard of hearing and the first thing I noticed was that the music was so loud that I could not hear my wife.   While it did not take long to be seated, the design of the place makes it so that you are still in close proximity to the bar.  We could clearly hear the bartender over the loud music.  Not an enjoyable experience. We decided to order two things off of the two for $25 menu.  My wife ordered the shrimp, while I ordered the mac and cheese, honey pepper chicken tender dish.  We also ordered the onion rings as an appetizer.   The onion rings were good.  The shrimp was overcooked.  The mac and cheese was not good and the honey pepper chicken tenders tasted odd.  When you place them on top of the mac and cheese, it simply was not a good combination.   After I put my food in a to-go container to take home for my dogs, I discovered a large spot of honey at the bottom of the bowl with the mac and cheese sauce.  It was as if they either dipped the tenders in honey and then placed them in the bowl on top of the pasta, or poured the honey on the tenders while they were in the bowl.  Either way, it was quite disgusting. The server was mediocre at best.  We had to ask her for silverware and she was a bit inattentive, although the inattentiveness could be due to having too many tables, which seems to be a common occurrence these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.7640000000000002,2.24

Both times, I went with their pick n pair lunch combos. Basically, you picked a entree, and with it, you get unlimited soups or salads. Soups OR salads? What about soups AND salads? Well my second time there, I was served by a server named Heather. She was great! I asked her if I was allowed to go for both soups and salads with a pick n pair, and she allowed me to do it! Unfortunately, it was almost three years ago since I ate there, so I can't comment on the exact details of all the soups and salads there, but they were all pretty good! They had a couple of soups and eight salads to choose from. I thought there should have been more, but I was able to eat about half of all of their selections (minus the entrees, of course) in one lunch and ate the other half of their selections for my other lunch. And the service (outside of Heather) was pretty good too! I barely waited at all before I was seated, and they treated me good despite the fact that I ate by myself both times.

After about 10-15 minutes, we noticed a couple sitting close to us leaving and saying nobody ever came to their table. Nobody had stopped at our table either. Looked like only 1 server in the place. Another table was sending their meal back because they said it was not even done. As we sat there waiting for service, we noticed a family of 4 looking like they were pissed. They had been waiting for a long time also. They were talking about how long everything was taking. Needless to say we wern't about to sit any longer and spend our money in a restaurant that had poor service and serving crappy food. After about 25-30 minutes we got up and left along with another table. No manager in sight.  As we were leaving, we noticed staff in the back of the business, standing outside the back door, smoking and looking like they were just hanging out, while people are leaving. No wonder Applebee's is struggling to survive. Management doesn't care or oversee staff.  They lost about 6 people within just the 30 minutes I was there.

I don't know I could have just been me that I was very tired but other people at my table also noticed. When you go to Red Lobster,  doesn't seem to matter, at all-- the management is always on pointe with every individual table regardless if they're super busy or not they always ask how your dinner is they even kind of overdo it just a tad but you don't mind it because you could tell that they're genuine Only gave three stars because of the food items spinach artichoke dip perfect the quesadillas those new ones on the menu those are also quite delicious and the server was so good it wasn't for them I would get one star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

The order of double crunch wings as I started eating them I was wondering where the crunch was.  They were the most soggiest and cold wings I have ever eaten. The house salad that we ordered was not so bad I would give it a 3 on a scale from 1 to 10.  The steak quesadillas were the most hideous disgusting concoction I have ever encountered in my lifetime.  I felt so sorry that it was such a waste of food that I figured my big dog Scrappy who pretty much eats all leftovers as we put the leftovers in his bowl for him to feast on, he just gave us this super discouraging look of disappointment and simply walked away.  The spinach/artichoke dip was okay but seemed overcooked but since we were so famished we had no choice but to eat it. The only happiness we received at your establishment was the nice cold Blue Moon's we had. The waiter was very quick to bring them too.  When I told the waiter that we didn't like the quesadillas he literally told me he would bring a box so we could take them home!!! There was no apology or what can we do to make your visit better. He just simply didn't care!!  WE WILL NEVER  EAT AT THIS APPLEBEES AGAIN AND IT IS SUCH A SHAME SINCE THE OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS ARE OF BETTER QUALITY AND THIS RESTURANT REFLECTS ON THEM AS WELL!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12?start=40,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

The hostess was busy talking to her co-worker, did not care that I was speaking to her, she rolled her eyes and sat us in the very back of the establishment. We then waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our drink order. It was 112 out...I wanted a drink, badly. We waited for 15 minutes for this to happen. Our server came back with drinks and asked if we needed more time. I said no, and she looked irritated. She took our order and said she would bring a bread basket. We then waited and waited and waited for the bread. Another 15 minutes goes by and we now have bread.  Fast forward another 20 minutes and we have the food that was ordered! The meat was undercooked and cold in the center, the fish was overcooked and crunchy. The server came back about 10 minutes in and asked how the food was, and I told her exactly how it was. She apologized and walked away. It then took an additional 15 minutes to get our check. This place was not busy, there were maybe 12 people in the whole restaurant.

16,Shawna B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,11,6.0,2.0,2016-08-04,"I received an Applebee's gift card for my birthday in July so I've been to this establishment twice in the past month.  The first time I came here was on my birthday and I ordered online. When I came in the Carside to Go entrance I waited next to the register for 10 mins. Five waitresses walked by me and not one of them asked me if I needed help. There was one waitress who was having a lengthy conversation with an older man waiting for his Carside to Go food 5 feet away from me and she was blatantly ignoring me. After I'd waited 10 mins and been ignored, I walked back into the kitchen and asked her if my order was ready. She handed me my food and I paid and left. I wasn't rude. I didnt say anything to her. I try to think the best of people and figured they were probably just having an off night. I even left her a $3 tip which I probably shouldn't have because I've just read more reviews about the terrible service. Also, when I got the food home it sucked. I ordered a steak medium well that was rare/ very chewy and I'd ordered grilled vegetables on the side and what I got was a few small broccoli florets with no flavor. But what am I supposed to do? Tell my dad to stop sending me Applebee's giftcards? I don't think it's nice to tell people you don't like a present they've given you. So anyway I ordered to go again today and the service was good. My waitress was nice and gave me a couple discounts which was cool. But again, the food sucked. My steak was rare/ chewy instead of medium well and tender, the vegetables had no flavor, the mac n cheese was dry.  Wth?!  I remember Applebee's having good food once upon a time.  Is it my imagination?  Also, the menu sucks now.

Give me a break I'm giving this location a 1 star not for the employees but for the corporate staff for stressing employees out and not being more attentive to customer satisfaction.  Paying patrons do not care how the strawberry is cut we want good service and a good meal!!!

I went with my boyfriend and tried the dinner for two option, which gave us an appetizer and two entrees for $20, but we upped it to the $25 special. Our entrees: The Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp and the newer Butcher's Meat and Potatoes.  The Bourbon Chicken was fantastic. Chicken was a little stringy, but the chicken atop a garlic butter with shrimp and mushrooms was everything I wanted and more at the time. I can't deny that there are likely fancier and better places to go, but have to say that I was downright surprised by how much I enjoyed this dish. I will likely be ordering this again.  The Butcher's Meat and Potatoes was worth a shot. I had actually been craving something similar that you would find at an Irish bar, but Tucson has its limits with some ethnic foods. I enjoyed the chunks of meat and gravy, and was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of potatoes on my plate.

11,Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",0,67,2.0,1.0,2016-11-16,"When I went to walk in I had to wait in between the doors because two parties had entered but had been waiting for a hostess actually when I opened the door they were calling out for her. Eventually she came and seated the first party and then back for the next. The bartender called out that I can sit at the bar but I told him I wanted a booth. When the hostess came back she said ""you can sit at the bar"". I told her I would like a booth as those high chairs hurt my leg, this overwhelmed her. There were endless booths but they had everybody on one side all grouped together. She said she would have to, find the manager and get permission for me to sit in a booth when I said ok the expression on her face was not good... I told screw it I just have to deal with a high pub table. Her face then went back to a smile as she won, she got her way and the customer did not get his. The bartender is the waiter too and when he finishes talking the drunks at the bar he gets to you. I got a glass of water and when I ordered I asked for a really rare steak, no potatoes and steamed broccoli instead. Keep in mind I am there 20 plus minutes before I order. He came by and said medium rare right... I said NO REALLY RARE.... After a while on a skillet that is sizzling here comes the steak and potatoes... Yep not writing anything down so he forgot the deviations in my order.  He says let me replace this and comes back out of the kitchen in less than 2 minutes so I know the broccoli is not steamed properly... I try to cut it with the fork and I need a knife to cut the ""steamed"" broccoli... I said I think I should just leave and the server said ""OK"" so I start to get up to leave and the elusive Manager was over by the bar and heard me telling the server that this was a joke. The manager looks over, does not come over and the waiter says he is unhappy with the broccoli.... I said why don't you start from the beginning with  all the problems and he doesn't. I say screw it I will just pay my bill and leave as I saw that the so called manager was not going to waste his breathe or energy to come see why some one was walking out of his store. I paid the $16 check and only had a 1/4 cup of water and walked out because of the total incompetency of each and every employee there starting with the manager... This is corporate American at its best... Not worried about anything but the money... No service, no training, no pads and pens to write orders on and a chef that thinks broccoli steams in seconds. If you go to the corporate site of Applebee's you will see that this is business as usual. Embarrassing ratings at their home site and every other review site. FYI: they did say you don't have to pay but the manager didn't look onboard with the waiter saying that so I swiped my card and paid to ensure I do not patronize them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

Then Ming (I believe that was her name) showed up and she made things better right away. You could tell she was running around dealing with other tables, but she was always happy and upbeat. She even helped my mother save money on her meal since it qualified. She could have just let her pay more, but she didn't so that was great. She never let out drinks go down and our food was great.

5,Drew P.,"Tucson, AZ",52,225,225.0,2.0,2017-05-11,"We went in this location this morning at 12:15AM and it was a bit frastraiting. We sit down and it's another 10 minutes before someone greets table. It wasn't to offer option however to inform the table they wouldn't be allowing alcohol to be served to our table. It was my fiancée's Birthday and he was clearly intoxicated, however 3 of the 5 of us haven't had anything to drink the entire night further none of us planned to order a drink.  So, then it's another 5 minutes for the waitress to arrive and her first words were that the restaurant closes at 1am. We thought it closed at 2am and she informed me several months back they changed to 1am. So, the table places the order and about 5 minutes later the waitress arvives they didn't have the cheeses Al gratin type potatoes I ordered ran out a few days ago. So, she said they could do mash with cheese, I agree. Well, when my steak arrives it's clear it's not a 12oz and I ask and come to find out since the steak I ordered is from the butchers cut they ran out of 12oz and they subbed it for a 8oz. lol The sides were just ok. One of the other plates the scrimp was rubbery and the appetizer  we ordered of spinach dip was served in a a small bowl the same that's given with the appetizer combo which was ordered  as well by my fiancee as his meal. Which im assuming was because it was close to closing and they didn't want to make the extra. Then when the bill came they charged me for the subbing of the side and no discount for smaller steak. Well, then the management started doing something I consider very rude they turned off the TV I was watching when the clock hit 1am and followed by turning off the music (which as we were walking out they turned back on). Which since our plates arrived just minutes prior to 1am is very rude. If they don't want to serve near closing they should have a closing time and a posted time like many other buissness that states last table to be seated is a hour prior to closing. The only reason they are getting two stars and not one is aside from the waitresses faliures she was very nice and my steak tempture was close to medium rare which from experience is very difficult for apple bees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tucson-12,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
