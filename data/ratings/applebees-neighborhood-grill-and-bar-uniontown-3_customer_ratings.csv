6,Justin P.,"Smock, PA",3,25,4.0,4.0,2013-05-10,I love Uniontown Applebee's! The service is great and the food is amazing! You can't beat the 2 for $20. 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for only $20!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
2,Angela S.,"Richlands, VA",0,17,1.0,1.0,2014-07-19,"This place always disappoints. Today was no exception. The wait was 45 minutes for food with the restaurant only about 20% full.  The steak was disgusting, the texture and taste reminded me of a microwave TV dinner.  That being said the fries were amazing. If I had it to do over we would order the appetizer sampler and a basket of fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
3,Carissa K.,"Smock, PA",16,3,,4.0,2014-08-21,"The recent renovation at the Uniontown Applebees is beautiful, and includes more pictures of the historic Uniontown High School rather than just Laurel Highlands High School (which as a Uniontown alumna, I'm proud to see). I usually don't find the hostesses very friendly, but most of the waiters/waitresses make up for that. I've always received my meals in a timely manner. The half price appetizer deal usually brings me here, so if you are new to applebees, I would recommend trying the boneless wings!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
5,Mindy L.,"Connellsville, PA",7,30,14.0,4.0,2014-10-05,"I was there for lunch. Had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich. It was very good. The french fries were hot. Every time I had been here and ordered french fries they were always hot. I wanted coffee with my meal and our waiter Aaron, said he would make me fresh coffee. Had a good experience and a very good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
4,Rod H.,"Uniontown, PA",0,3,,2.0,2016-03-17,Disappointed. The bar doesn't know how to make drinks. I ordered a margarita with salt. They use table salt and very little of it and the steak I ordered seemed like it was cooked in the microwave. They could do a lot better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
1,Matt S.,"Uniontown, PA",0,41,10.0,5.0,2017-05-06,"It's a touch pricey for what you get as far as portion size, but half price app nights make up for the difference. The wait staff is amazing and its always relaxing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-uniontown-3,,,,,
