10,Domenico M.,"Marcy, NY",456,22,10.0,3.0,2013-05-11,"Although I'm not typically a fan of franchise restaurants, I really like the grilled chicken and shrimp here.  Not to mention that it's really inexpensive considering.  If you want a good meal with good service, check out Applebees.  I have to mention that the Applebees in New Hartford has much better wait staff service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
13,Audrey B.,"Hamilton, NY",19,15,27.0,4.0,2013-06-02,Went there last night for my boyfriend's sister's 18th birthday. Just imagine about 20 people. The staff took it so well. AMAZING food and I love their 2 for $20 deal!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
9,Jyoti N.,"Seattle, WA",69,381,851.0,3.0,2014-01-18,The hostess was rude when I asked for a window seat and kept arguing with me. Only 2 tables were occupied in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and made up for it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
8,Barbara Z.,"New York, NY",492,206,130.0,3.0,2015-08-28,"Average. Food was decent...not the greatest quality. Service is painfully slow, even late at night. They seem to be constantly understaffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
7,David D.,"Ogdensburg, NY",0,18,23.0,2.0,2016-03-13,For starters I feel the prices were very high for what you received.  Service very slow-- an hour to get our lunch.  The waitress worked hard at keeping drinks filled.  Most likely won't visit another Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
3,Amana C.,"DE, DE",135,383,740.0,3.0,2016-08-03,"Too loud.   Appetizers are only half off if you sit at the bar.  Slow service.  Salads are pretty good, lots of flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
2,J.P. W.,"Chicago, IL",80,76,12.0,1.0,2016-11-27,"A couple of tips included in this review of this disappointing Applebees: 1.  You better like your meat the way they cook it, no matter what they decide that day, because the server thought I was crazy for asking if my steak could be cooked medium rare. They come out medium and that's that. There's no well-done, no medium rare, nothing of the sort. One size fits all and it's called boil in a bag. Like it, nippy. 2.  Whenever you see someone that resembles an Applebees staff member, flag them down and get a drink. It doesn't matter if you already have a drink, stock up. It's rare for the server to come by to see if you need refills, unless she asks how your meal was and doesn't wait for an answer. You will then be bestowed a refill. Keep chewing your meat and be happy she feigned a caring attitude. 3.  Everything comes out at once. Specifying that you want your appetizer, then salad, then entree is silly and a complete waste of breath and time. Appetizer, salad, entree... they're all coming out at once so get ready to sit down and inhale your food because something is going to get cold unless it's already cold then it's going to get warm. You will have a lot of food placed before you. There is one course and everything goes into that course.  4.  Occasionally there seems to be a game where a person who is not your server comes by and puts a napkin and plates down on the table just to, and I quote, ""mess with your server"". It's the stuff sitcoms are made of. 5.  Be thankful for the automated electronic gizmos on the table so you don't have to wait for your server to bring a check. Said server will never stop by with a check or to check your drink or anything, so just hit a button and get the heck out of there as quickly as possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
5,Earl C.,"Cicero, NY",52,2,,1.0,2016-11-27,"I can not believe how bad this place continues to be. I've tried many times. I give up.  Wait to be greeted by server, wait for drinks, then all food comes out together.. salad, appetizer (why is it called starter?), and entrees.  Burger - requested pink received crispy around the edges Steak - ""we always serve medium"" - WELL DONE. Waitress as she walks by ""Hoe is everything  do you need a refill? She never stopped to hear me say ""over cooked""  Maybe she'll read this instead when she checks the video game console and realize her tip was as bad as her service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
6,Sarah E.,"New Hartford, NY",88,1,,4.0,2017-04-18,"I love the food here and our waitress had a great personality, and made sure we were happy with everything that we ordered. The manager came to our table once and asked if I wanted another drink, and I saw her go to the bar, have a disagreement and then never saw the manager again, and never got the drink. She didn't even come back to the table and apologize. Then she charged us for a  drink that we didn't even order and our waitress took care of it for us. The waitress definitely made my dining experience at Applebee's a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
4,Daniella R.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,3,2.0,2.0,2017-07-08,"This is probably the worst Applebee's I've been to (I live in NJ and haven't had any issues with the ones there). The meat was not fully cooked and tasted like rubber. The brócoli was also really bad because it was served cold and tasted stale. In addition, the serving sizes are much smaller than what I expected [having visited other Applebee's]. The only good part was the waitress who was nice to us but other than that the food was not the best. 3/10 would recommend. Never going here again !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
1,Angel N.,"Omaha, NE",122,82,261.0,2.0,2017-09-17,"Today was my second time at this Applebee's after I started to yelp and i have to say this place has not gotten any better. Let's start with seating, first the host placed us at small little booth that doesn't fit my 6ft 1 husband and let alone my baby so we were a little uncomfortable and the tables next to us were dirty and left alone. Our poor waitress must be busting those tables after she's gotten other customers in. She was the only one at that section. The host seems to be young and didn't care to help but just to stand around doing nothing. The floor was dirty and left with waste and no one care to sweep it and still hasn't even when we were done eating. Anyways we've ordered 2 for 20. We got the spinach dip and chips and let me say the chips were as salty as an ocean can be! It was disappointing and so was our grilled chicken. Chef must never seen salt in his life or something. This place just don't do justice but it's still running great. It's a hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
0,Carol W.,"Lake Pleasant, NY",11,290,41.0,4.0,2017-12-01,I was surprised and pleased by this place.  It is in the mall area by BJ's and I have never been there.   A friend and I did the 2 for 25 steak.  I asked for medrare and it was!  The baked potatoe was a bit undercooked but the broccoli was great.  I would definitely return.  Service was great and relatively fast,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-5,,,,,
