The workers here are not snotty but also not the friendliest I've encountered. The food is your average ab's meals. But I will say it seems that my friend was jipped a bit of her meal last time I came here. My meal was delicious though. A cowboy burger with a veggie pattie and no Bacon. Scrumptious.  2 for 1 drinks. Can't beat that. Not strong. So you'll need both if you're trying to feel it.  Anyways, if you're looking for some food and not the typical food court meals this is the least crowded of the restaraunts in the mall area. Service ins't knock your sox off great BUT the crowd is light.. you can deal with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream?start=40,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005
44,Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105.0,1.0,2012-06-29,"Do NOT deposit your money, earned through sweat and tears, into this shit factory that consistently churns out  rotten nasty crap on a daily basis. Things that made me want to pull my hair out: 1. Waiting an an hour and a half to get into the eye of the shit storm. For some reason the people who frequents Green Acres and this Applebee's love to consume steamy piles of excrement in form of crap service, crap interior, and OK food that doesn't make up for the manure. The last few times I was dragged  there I was welcomed by an army of people eagerly awaiting to be showered in cow pies.  2. Horrible service.  The people who work there seems to be more unhappy to be there than I was. They don't give a shit, they don't care about providing good service, and the majority of them are just plain rude unpleasant people. 3. Sticky seats, sticky tables, splotchy utensils. Just ick.  4. The kitschy stuff hanging on the walls was cool in the 90s. It would be tolerable if they change up once in a blue moon. Now it's just irritating. Things that didn't make me want to pull my hair out: 1. The food is OK.  Decent food with a lot of selection. It's your standard chain restaurant food available  inexpensively through various deals. If I were to come here more often I would start looking like Yul Brenner from the King and I. I'll maintain my thick head of hair since I will never come back here.

We were on the last leg of a very long vacation - after being in Europe, stopped over in NY just for a few days before flying home to CA.  We were tired of being on the go, jet-lagged and just needed a familiar meal near our hotel at JFK airport.  We found it at Applebee's near the Green Acres Mall.  The hostesses were bright and cheerful, as was our server, Patrick.  He helped us with some driving directions, too.  Small kindnesses can really make a family's day.  Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

55,Ken -.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,11,,1.0,2013-07-18,"Never in my life have I experienced such a derogatory service and establishment. If I had known better, I would've skipped the wait time and saved my money to eat the higher quality food that my pet dog consumes on a daily basis. It is not an enjoyable experience sitting on dirty, sticky, and unsanitary seats while attempting to deal with the repugnant staff and unpleasant food. The amount of unprofessionalism radiating from this establishment is so appalling that I would rather have kindergarteners serve the food while paying them tenfold. If you do decide to go here, I hope you enjoy the zoo. I discovered a new level of abomination that I have never tasted from any type of food in my lifetime. The overcooked food and small portions along with the strong taste of your very own household refrigerator puts the restaurant industry to shame. The waiters would much rather be watching the basketball game simultaneously occurring on 10 different televisions than give the slightest bit of attention to the needs of a customer. If you do decide to go here, stop what you're doing, stand up, and sprint for the door as fast as you can. Don't look back, don't say a word. They must think straws serve no purpose to individuals who require fulfilling their thirst and diluting the strong taste of such horrendous food in their mouths. I also had no idea that a dine-in restaurant does not offer metal spoons. Instead, I was given black, plastic spoons that were still in the slimy plastic wrapper, which I had to manually remove myself. Sadly, the bill was also overcharged and I won't even begin to explain how incompetent the manager was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream?start=40,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

58,Shaan N.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,2013-12-15,"This is my first review. I am a fan of yelp, I read it a lot when I want advice on a nice place to go with my wife. Let me first start by saying that I am a man's man. I love sports and beer with wings etc...... while I'm watching a sports game. I also love to support local businesses in my area. I am also 33 years of age. After working a long week of work I decided to go to my local Applebee's at Green Acres Mall. My wife was home with our 1 year old. I wanted a quick beer, wings and some me time. I just moved to Valley Stream so I wanted something quick so I went here. It was a long wait, which I understand. I was happy that the host was able to get me a seat along the bar area, without a wait. The bar was crowded which is not a problem at all. I like a nice football crowd. I waited exactly 20 mins before my waitress came to greet me. While I was waiting I looked at the staff whom were all no older than at least 21. I have no problem with that. I love to see young people working. They were extremely loud and talking amongst themselves. One female who is West Indian was yelling across the bar and rudely yelling at the bartender. I am an African American; I have respect all races but I was still waiting for my waitress and observing this rude behavior. I finally placed a order for a blue moon beer which they did not have. O.k. no problem 2 for 1 I'll take a Long island ice tea. My drink came 15 mins later. It took me 25 mins to finish both drinks. My waitress never came back to take my food order. But I knew where to find her. She was standing next to the other 21 year old staff members with the bartender and the loud West Indian  waitress. I got her attention and called her over. I ordered burger sliders which were good and came quickly. I was done with the sliders in 15 mins. I was ready to order my entrée. Where is my waitress? Don't worry I knew where to find her. I got her attention and ordered 10 buffalo wings with the bones. My food came about 25 mins later boneless. Her assistant brought it to me. I told her assistant I ordered on the bone. Her assistant left with the wings and came back 5 mins later with the wings again boneless, SMH. Again I told her I want it on the bone. She left and my waitress came 10 mins later and asked me did I want it on the bones or not. OMG, How hard is it for a man to get a order of wings. The wings finally came about 10 mins later. I ate my wings and order nachos to go for my wife. While I was waiting for my nachos, an older caucasion family arrived next to me a waited 15 mins before someone took there order. I called the manager over and complained. Like I said I'm a man's man, but I expect good service. The manager looked like she was a heroin addict. She was nodding while I was talking to her. I could not wait to leave. I paid my bill and still left a %20 tip. I went home to give my pregnant wife her nachos which was extremely dry with no chili. I Then took a bite out of my wings, which had blood in it. Like I said this is my first and maybe last review. Don't go to this place. And for my men who think this is a nice outing to watch football think again. Don't go here. The food is awful, the staff is young and untrained and the manager is a heroin addict.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream?start=40,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

Nothing was done wrong at all and everything was seasoned to perfection. I love this Applebee's so much and I love this location more than any other location in Brooklyn and manhattan.

My boyfriend, daughter and I came in last week Sunday 3/8/15 for dinner around 7:30pm, we were told it would be a 15/20 min wait. This was fine since every other place was an 1-1 1/2 wait but thinking about it now I should've left. After about 25 mins we were seated, while waiting we figured out everything we wanted from drinks to food so we can be in and out. The waiter came and we ordered everything we wanted. He bought out the appetizer and kids meal pretty quickly (8pm) which was fine since our daughter was really hungry. He then bought out the drinks and then it went down hill from there. We waited almost another 30/40 about 8:40/45 before our food arrived but that was only after our server finally passed by again and said ""wow they didn't bring out your food"" then ran to the back. I'm assuming they forgot about us and just tried to whip out the food as fast as they could. I ordered the 3 penne cheese i believe and it looked like they just threw everything on it, the cheese was cold and the penne wasn't cooked. My boyfriend got the steak the vegetables were horrible and wasnt offered steak sauce.

The waiter Jay(if I remember correctly)was very nice and kid friendly. The kids had a lot of requests ( like A Shirley Temple with extra extra cherries ) and not once did he get upset he just for filled it to the best of his ability. When it came time for me to order and couldn't find anything I would eat he was able to make a great suggestion that I was very satisfied.

13,Andy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",559,26,1.0,1.0,2016-10-21,"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK, let's get into this.  First off, I can't say anything bad about the food. It was usual Applebee's food. There was nothing wrong with it.  What I had a BIG problem with was the employees.  There were two of us. We sat at the bar and just had beer, wine, and some apps. Nothing too big or hard.  The two bartenders were named Kahl (male) and Franny (female).  Kahl ignored us when we sat down right in front of him. Franny eventually came over and took our drink orders. She was pleasant enough and seemed nice.  We got our drinks, ordered our food, and talked a bit.  This is where the issues started. There were two women ( I didn't get their names) sitting on opposite sides of the bar, talking to each other. Not sitting NEXT to each other, you understand, sitting literally on opposite sides, so that their conversation could be heard by the entire bar and the tables that were close. They even joked about how loud they were talking.  Soon, I realized why they were sitting like this. They work there. I only figured this out when Franny, Kahl, and the two other women all began complaining and talking shit about other employees that work there.  Now, I understand that employees complain about other employees and about their bosses. This is nothing new and it's as it should be.  What I CAN'T accept, is when the two employees sitting at the bar start saying at the top of their lungs... ""They all faggots! I don't like NO ONE here. They all faggots!"" All of this is happening loud and clear, with TWO young children sitting very close to them.  That...is NOT ok.  Soon, Kahl is trying to clock out of his shift, so he's ignoring us and complaining to the other employees about hurrying up so he can ""get the fuck out!"". We had to interrupt their homophobic conversation just to ask for our check.  This is a corporate, family restaurant. Not cool.  And ""faggots""? Seriously? What year is this?!?!?  Thumbs down.

The service was horrible, we had two kids and they sat us in the bar section. REALLY ?  After asking for the booth, they insisted that this section would be comfortable and we would have to wait long for a booth. Being that we were starving, we just sat there.  The food was mediocre, nothing more than commercialized ready made meals.  I am now reminded why I haven't been to Applebees in so long. Even the two for $20 deals had menu choices that were NOT exciting.  Also, the service level here is below average. A bunch of just out of highschool kids, with attitudes. It's great that they are working, but the manager should know who to put in charge or not.  While leaving we walked through the lobby and smelled the horrible skunk like marijuana smell, which just turned my stomach. Seriously, are they smoking on the job. Just horrible.

I have eaten here occasionally because the mall food court is always crowded. The last time the food had to go back because it was not hot.   I had lunch recently and the food was okay. But that is not the point this time. First, let me say Applebee's is not cheap. Lunch or a dinner will run you ten dollars plus.  What was shocking were the napkins! Yes, people the napkins. The napkins were the same texture and color as the brown paper towels that you find in public restrooms. What is going on here. The napkins were hard as a rock.   Applebee's is sliding down hill fast at this location.

22,Leslie R.,"Inglewood, CA",91,20,,1.0,2017-04-03,My first time to apple bee's on vacation with my husband . We kept seeing apple bees every where so while in the mall we decided to give the a try. First thing our waiter Ryan was playing with his hair while taking our orders and having a little meeting with other employees two booths behind us talking about his hair? Really? My drink was water down and I asked was it a virgin drink the manger came to respond saying everything is measured. Can I offer another drink I took him up on the offer glad I did much better 2nd time around. I suppose my expectations we set too high the appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) yuck my husband's chicken was dry a s the desert he some how stomached his meal. Ryan recommendations for me was some taco  a newer item on the menu I should have order the dry chicken. One bite and I was done the manager comes  again asked me how was the food I told him I didn't care for the tacos and he asked would you like me to leave them? I said no he asked can I offer you something else. I'm over it NO thank you!! I will grab a slice a pizza on any NY street and be more satisfied. Ryan come back twirling his hair with the check I noted the price for the drink was wrong and brought it to his attention. He steps away for 4 minutes then makes his way back towards us to help someone seated behind us. Me and husband become very irritated and speak of our irration. He completes the order the pops his head in and says I'm waiting on my manager to make the adjustment. Then returns another 3-4 minutes with the correction. My husband gives him the money for the bill Ryan asks do you need change. We say yes he goes back to table two booths back with his co workers and says they want change back. WTF does he not realize we can hear you stupid little boy and owe you nothing. I WILL NEVER step into another apple bees EVER.

12,Rich R.,"Woodmere, NY",0,7,,1.0,2017-05-01,"My very first experience at this Applebee's was a very negative one. The wait for a table was not long but the service after that point was very unpleasant. Our drinks and silverware came a little after the food, which by the way had a wrong order for one of us in the group. Necessities like straws and napkins also came much later than expected. When the silverware did arrive, it was in a glass of cloudy water that did not seem very clean. The food itself was not at its optimal warmth and thus took away from the flavor. The Long Island Iced Tea that a friend of mine ordered tasted unlike any other LI Iced Tea for some reason. The taste was reminiscent of dishwater and ginger...an unlikely combination lol. Once these issues were brought to the manager, he properly apologized and gave us a free dessert. We vowed to never return.  Come here if you so desire.

As a business for you to sit people down in an area and think this is okay and normal we could've waited 10 more minutes for the area to have been swept.

I explained to the waiter how frustrated and unsatisfied I was and he took my plate.  We also were never given napkins , forks, spoons at all and ketchup. We had to ask a waiter whom was passing by  The bill came and I assumed that because I didn't eat my food not even 10% of it , that he would of removed it from the bill but he didn't . I had to tell him and the manager never came out either to apologize about my food .  I came hungry and left starving , also left with the mindset of never returning .

If you ask for steak or a burger medium, it always comes back well done and burnt. Ugggh ( the worst). Chicken quesadilla is always good I suppose from the appetizers except for yesterday. For some reason that quesadilla was disgusting. Flavorless with hardly any chicken in it. I did taste the overpowered flavor of the cheese though. .

He didn't say hi, he just gave us menus and walked away. Then we asked him for two 1.00 margaritas and I specifically asked him to put salt on mine. He told me that it's was too much work for him to do because he makes a lot of margaritas within 5 hours. I checked my surroundings and noticed that there was only one guest at the bar and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I kindly asked him and he said he'll do it for me. But as a guest who is excited to come to his restaurant, I shouldn't be told that it's too much work to do anything.
