14,Georgette B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,2.0,2012-01-02,"Had not been to Applebee in a while. Usually we would order the Bourbon Street steak with a glass of wine. So Sunday, New Year's day my husband and I decided to pay them another visit. A we entered there were two parties waiting to be seated. So three parties are waiting and there are three tables on the left unoccupied. Well after 20 minutes we were seated at one of those vacant tables. Did not make one bit of sense. Why the wait?  After we were seated we ordered 2 of the steak and shrimp which looked fabulous on the menu. With what appeared to be 2"" shrimps atop the steak, steamed vegies, parsleyed red potatoes. Yum. We ordered 2 Heineken which came promptly, were plunked on the tables without glasses. So we figured, yes we could drink from the bottle, although in my  culture that is not considered cool for a lady to do. Because we were quite hungry, by then it was 2:00pm we ordered a bowl of soup and that came quickly. And was decent. The entree, however, took a while to arrive, and when got it it was cold. I assume it had been sitting a while in some corner of the kitchen as the staff was quite busy tending to the table of 20 next to us. Oh yes they got great service. At our expense it seems. Anyway big disappointment. The order was a miniature version of the picture on the menu. The shrimps were about 1/2"" long, the potatoes had been sitting in water a while, they were cold, and worse the vegies that were supposed to be steamed were raw. And there was a huge clump of broccoli sitting there. Never mind that the steak was so tough that I could not finish it. Worse cut of meat I have ever had. Bye bye applebee. Wish we had gone to McGrath as we had first discussed. Will be wiser next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=40,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

37,Thomas C.,"Vancouver, WA",5,1,,1.0,2013-08-26,"I used to love Applebee's however, it's just not the same anymore. This Applebee's, especially, was unremarkable in every way. The staff isn't all that bad, however the food was VERY mediocre and absolutely NOT worth the price. The grilled chicken was bland, there was absolutely no flavor in the meat of the chicken; it's just hidden with a rather tasteless glaze on top. My girlfriends onions weren't even caramelized (Which isn't a huge deal but when you're paying $15 and practically the entire topping was raw it's not very appealing to say the least). The sandwiches are a joke; there is NO way any of the sandwiches they make are worth even 1/2 of the price. Their fries are mediocre, the fish and chips aren't worth the price and rather bland. About the ONLY good thing they have are their deserts. They're tasty and aren't super spendy! Overall, If you want pretty small portions of overpriced mediocre food then definitely hit up this Applebee's! But I will be avoiding this place from now on sadly. I could've just been there on a bad day, however I'm not willing to gamble another $50 to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=20,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002

One thing, it was supposed to come with potatoes, and I didn't see rice anywhere on the menu, but they must have had it because our waiter said I could sub rice for the potatoes and no extra charge. Exactly what I wanted, medium-rare perfectly pink center, sauce on the side for even less calories and only $14.99. Kudos for that and friendly service.

30,Sharon M.,"Vancouver, WA",2,24,,2.0,2015-02-25,"Had a gift card for Applebee's and last night we went for dinner about 6:40 pm.  Promptly greeted, seated, and asked if we had plans  Expecting a food or drink related question I stared blankly at the server.  Then with my endless wit replied, ""What?""  The full question was repeated a little hesitantly, Did we have plans?  Felt a bit like being in a Bullwinkle and Rocky episode that I didn't remember being cast in.  Yes, we did have plans - to eat.   Then on to drink selection, mine, water, MDS wanted flavored lemonade and asked what flavors there were.  The server said ""Lots""  The same server who was so interested in our ""plans"" wasn't so interested in providing information about the flavors or maybe a password was required.  After a few guesses of flavors that were not available he reluctantly provided us with a list.  We looked over the very wordy and complicated menu, hard to do when hungry and without the decoder key.  Decided on the $25 twofer with onion rings as an appetizer, and entrees of fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast.  Onion rings arrived, very brown, hot and with a cup of dipping sauce.  The onion rings tasted slightly scorched and the dipping sauce was a too sweet barbeque. Neither enhanced the flavor of the onion which is what I wanted to taste.  Burgerville does it better.  Between ordering and receiving our entrees at least three to four random servers asked us questions, only one of which had any purpose except in fulfilling their  version of providing good service.  Service which was totally unrelated to any action on our part.  It was annoying and guilt provoking - I mean, who wants to admit to being annoyed by people supposedly trying to please us?  Use your eyes and ears people!  If customers are engaged in talking to one another or eating, have full water glasses, aren't looking around to catch someone's eye - leave them alone.   Now for the food.  MDS was happy with his shrimp even though they were the same dark brown as the onion rings.  The breast of chicken I ordered was superbly tender and moist as well as plentiful.  The sautéed mushroom & onion were flavorful but were cooked in 1/4 cup oil when  a tablespoon could have done the job.  The red potatoes were a dark brown and very dry.  MDS gave me his cole slaw which was nicely dressed, seasoned, and fresh tasting.  The fresh parsley was a very nice addition. So, a 2 for service, only because no one was rude and we did get our food.  The food ranged from a 1, the onion rings and potatoes, to a 5 for the chicken and shrimp for an averages of 3.  Making the final score a 2.5 which Yelp doesn't support.   .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

54,Wendy B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,2,,1.0,2016-10-16,We have been here many times.Usually it is good food.However we went there yesterday and it was awful.Our chips were stale so we sent them back and ordered onion rings which were raw on the inside.A female manager came and said she was going to give us bread but we ordered onion rings.She appeared intoxicated.She said she would not charge us for our app but she did.When we got our meal the rice was a day or so old.We were so hungry we are it!!it wasnt busy...we wasted 25 bucks!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
46,Micah C.,"Vancouver, WA",4,26,,2.0,2016-11-29,"I've gone several times before, and been satisfied. The last time I went, however, it seems their entire menu had changed for the worse. Everything we ordered came in tiny, unsatisfying, and overpriced portions. My friend and I were mystified, as we'd eaten there three times a couple months ago, and always been very happy with the portion sizes. My enchiladas were the saddest, tiny little things, with a heap of rice. Everyone left still very hungry and disappointed, but looking at the portion sizes and the prices, we figured we'd have to pay double-to-triple a normal meal's cost in order to feel full. We couldn't even order dessert, because the only desserts they have on the new menu are different variations of ""brownie and ice cream"", which no one wanted. WTF. We decided to stop by Shari's to buy a couple pies to have at home, so we could actually end our night feeling full. I'll never hit Applebee's again, here or any other location (I assume it's probably the result of the recent company-wide menu change). Go next door to McGraff's, where you can actually fill up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

24,Peggy F.,"Camas, WA",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-26,"Applebee's on Mill Plain in Vancouver for us was a terrible experience. First off the lady escorting us to our table had heavy powder/cologne fragrance about her. Not good! Wanted cup of soup - only had ""bowls.""  The waiter assured me the bowl was 5 oz., which actually cracked me up - I did research at home and a ""cup"" is generally 6-8 oz. and a bowl around 12 oz. Their BOWL is smaller than a normal CUP.  And it truly was small. Ordered corn chips to supplement - they never came. The place was quiet - but workers were scarce. When we saw them they were typically clustered together chatting. Worst thing was that the heat was blasting on us entire time - it was uncomfortably hot. Felt sorry for workers. After we asked, Manager told us they had adjusted it but that the furnace ""had mind of its own"" - and it just kept pumping out heat. She said it had been like that for the NINETEEN years she had worked there - that it was an ""old building."" All-in-all could not recommend this restaurant and do not intend to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

43,Elyse M.,"Washougal, WA",194,121,130.0,1.0,2017-10-16,"I haven't been to an Applebees in a REALLY LONG time! Food was really poorly made and service was less than exceptional. We had a group of 5 with one child. It's pretty bad when you order a meal and it's so unappetizing that you cash out and go to another place. We did appetizers to start which admittingly were pretty good. We had the chicken wonton tacos... so good, the boneless wings... meh, and steak quesadilla...good. For dinner we did the 2 for $20. My better half and I both ordered buffalo chicken strips for our main course. They were so over cooked and had barely any sauce on them. It was awful. One of the people with us ordered the oriental salad and asked for the dressing on the side. They brought her a salad loaded with dressing plus an additional sauce on the side, not at all what she asked for. Our waitress was even less impressive than the food. We were all drinking beer but I really wanted a water (surprised we weren't given any when we sat down, not even the child got a water) Anyways, I think we asked 7 or 8 different times for 2 waters and didn't get them until we were basically leaving. when it came time for the bill, the tablet on our table didn't work. We asked several times for our check explaining to her it wasn't working. When she finally brought it over we went to hand her a card and she was already gone. We were so frustrated with the entire night, we gathered enough cash to pay our bill and leave. I used to like going here but man I don't know what happened in the year I hadn't been here but it is so awful now I wouldn't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
