21,Lewej W.,"Dallas, TX",401,30,4.0,3.0,2013-08-13,This location was extremely slow last night. The only redeeming factor was the food. The steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection and the $5.99 burgers were delicious. I also ordered a house salad as a side instead of fries for $1 more. I was delightfully surprised at how big the salad was. I'll visit again to see if the slow service was just a fluke or not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
24,D C.,"Bellingham, MA",0,38,1.0,2.0,2013-12-29,"Went with relatives on 12/28/13 around 2 pm. because we had gift certificates. Everything was going well, until payment. We left the gift cards in with the bill, the waitress took everything. A few minutes later she came back and told us that we didn't put anything in the bill folder.  Finally she agreed to go and look to see if they fell out. She came back and told us that we were ok...she found them on the floor. I was a bit ticked off that she would come to us and assume we did not put anything in to pay the bill before she looked for it on the floor. She was the one who created the mistake, but assumed it was the paying customer. I would never go back to this Applebee's. There are other ones in the area with the same type of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole?start=20,,,,,
19,Lauren H.,"Holbrook, MA",0,47,,2.0,2014-03-29,"Had not been to this location since it was the Ground Round (so that tells you how long it has been).  Hubs got the Cowboy Burger - seemed to enjoy it.  The 4 year old got a hot dog, with Go-Go Applesauce - fine.  I got the Chicken Caesar salad.  It was the most bland, tasteless salad I have ever had in my life (and I've had some ""eh"" salads in my day).  The lettuce (iceberg, mostly)  was cold (so at least they refrigerate it) but I prefer maybe some Romaine thrown in for color/variety (I know, it's a chain restaurant, but whatever I do!).  The ""Caesar"" dressing had zero flavor.  Absolute nada.  Even the chicken - which, since it was grilled, should have at least had SOME flavor to it - was pretty tasteless.  If I hadn't been so hungry, I might have sent it back.  They REALLY need to step up their game on that!   Our server was very nice and attentive though, and the dessert shooters were just the right size to end the meal (we got one of each).  We'll probably give this one another try, but I'll be ordering something else for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
9,Daniel I.,"Boston, MA",54,27,63.0,5.0,2015-05-22,This place was great and fast for a Friday night it was slow. We were seated immediately and our waiter Demitris was awesome and great he made sure my cups were full and my party too. The waitress were all friendly which is great in my book.   I got the racks of ribs for 18.97 it was worth it. The ribs were nice and juicy the honey bbq sauce was dripping all over my awesome beard. The side were french fries were okay but the cole slaw was to perfection nice and sweet with a great crunch. The food came out quick and which is another great thing. I would recommend this place for the food and great costumer service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
17,Elizabeth W.,"Yarmouth, MA",0,22,13.0,1.0,2015-08-01,"Do not bother!  If ZERO stars were an option, that would be my rating for this place. The single star is for the service.  It might have been higher but the poor food quality and the Manager brought it down.   I ordered a triple bacon burger, it looked good when they served it BUT when I cut it in half, the smell that wafted up from the burger was HORRIBLE!   I had my husband confirm that the burger was spoiled, then the waitress as well.  She was apologetic,  I thanked her and acknowledged that she hadn't cooked it and it was taken away.  The manager came by after about 5 minutes  and apologized that I ""hadn't liked my meal"", she said she would go back and check ""if"" the meat was spoiled.  She kept suggesting  that I didn't enjoy the burger, not acknowledging what her staff had also noted - the meat was spoiled.   She went on to tell me that they received new meat every 2 days, I said that ""new"" did not mean fresh.  She was patronizing in her communication style, she said would check, we never saw her again!    Our waitress brought the menu and offered to get me anything else,  by then I was totally put off by the remnant smells and thanked her but declined anything else.   When our check arrived our waitress announced that the manager had handled it.  We looked at the check and all the manager had done was remove the charge for the disgusting burger.  No comp or offer of any kind. This place needs some professional management training and help. The kitchen staff needs QUALITY CONTROL training. Go elsewhere.  Do not patronize a place that has a manager that is patronizing to customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
13,Sccott S.,"San Jose, CA",0,37,1.0,4.0,2015-08-20,"When you come to a franchise chain like Applebee's it is usually all about the service. I came here for lunch on a Thursday. They were not busy, I was seated right away. Connor was spot on with his service.    The turkey club was just as you would expect. The ratio of meat to bread was good. I really like their Sweet potato fries.  Would certainly return for lunch the next time I'm in town for business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
22,Lalanya W.,"Carolina, RI",6,4,1.0,2.0,2015-10-12,"Steak was grey and unappetizing. Told the waitress, she refused to comment then went to get the manager who took my meal off the bill, but no apologies for the poorly cooked steak.  Then we waited forever for the bill.  I usually like Applebee's but this one was sub part at best. You had one job and you blew it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole?start=20,,,,,
23,Lauren K.,"Boston, MA",88,3,,3.0,2015-11-21,Set my pick up time for 5 pm on my to-go order. Waited 45 minutes in the designated spot outside and was not acknowledged until 5:50 pm. Food was then cold and bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole?start=20,,,,,
20,Nancy C.,"Sharon, MA",0,2,,1.0,2016-05-08,"We have been to this Applebee's many times before and the food had been decent. Our family went there on Mother's Day for lunch. The place was quiet at noon time. I ordered Shrimp Wonton stir fry and they gave me sirloin beef stir fry instead. I wasn't picky about it so didn't immediately return the dish to the kitchen. Took one bite of the rice and it was hard and cold. So I ordered the Thai shrimp salad. It was the worst salad I have ever had. Although the waitress and manager were apologetic, my Mother's Day lunch was definitely ruined. Will not return to this Applebee again. It seems their entire menu has changed and the food has definitely gone downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole?start=20,,,,,
15,Tori S.,"Hull, MA",22,1,,1.0,2016-05-30,"My boyfriend and I go to Applebee's a lot especially the one in Milford but have been to the Walpole one once before. We got seated fast ordered our food, we get the four cheese Mac and cheese and the pasta was rubbery but the chicken was delicious! We get this meal all the time and today's wasn't good. We heard another table whose food wasn't cooked right either. The waitress took forever to take the card so we could pay so we just checked out on the table kiosk and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
12,Lisa M.,"Boston, MA",20,63,51.0,1.0,2016-06-20,Our waitress was great. But the cheeseburgers and rolls were burnt.  The garlic fries were awesome.  Just don't order a cheeseburger unless you like it well overdone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
16,Marissa V.,"Canton, MA",1,14,,1.0,2016-07-09,"Horrible horrible service it took the waitresses over a half hour for them to greet us and take our orders. And they weren't even busy the waitresses were all talking to each other and not doing anything. Food was great, service absolutely terrible.

10,Rebecca A.,"Taunton, MA",34,27,38.0,5.0,2016-08-09,"I have to say I was not a fan of the old menu a few years ago but since they have added new items and redid the menu last year I have been a fan. The items seem fresher and better quality. I really like this Applebee's especially if you frequent here. It feels like Cheers where everyone knows your name. The staff is really great here and attentive to your needs and always have a positive attitude. Heather, Tanya, and Bri are my favs here. They will also accommodate and recommend substitutions for allergies. But overall great stop for value and quality meals. Definitely worth the half price apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,

7,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566.0,5.0,2017-01-15,"Throughout the many, many closures of Applebee's, the Walpole location has always stayed alive, kicking, and successful! I used to come here so, so many times, and then just stopped. There wasn't any specific reason, but the menu always seemed the same then.... now, they did a complete renovation of the restaurants inside and out as well as an overhaul of the menu. Now, it's an ""above average"" spot to visit any day of the week for either lunch or dinner (or even take out.... sometimes I go to Walmart and then stop here for a quick take out dinner....). Staff are all amazing, and if you are a regular they will know you by name, and the restaurant in general is kept in great condition and always clean and lively. When the Applebee's in Dedham was still open, I specifically remember the restaurant constantly being DEAD! Here, there isn't regularly a wait, however, there is always lots of action.  The setup of the restaurant is also a benefit. Most other chain restaurants I know of have similar set ups of one all inclusive room of tables and booths. This restaurant has separated ""rooms"" by tall wooden divider-like walls to have extra light and more booths throughout (this description may not sound appealing, but you'll see what I mean...)  Food is always great and the 2 for $20 and 2 for $25 deals are always some of my favorite. Plus, the chefs here make everything exactly to order and quickly. I have absolutely no complaints about Applebee's, and only suggest it. Perfect spot to go before going to some event at Gillette Stadium, going out with the family, or getting something after shopping at the Walmart down the road (ha!). 5 stars for Applebee's in Walpole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
11,Ian B.,"Bellingham, MA",0,11,,4.0,2017-02-19,"This Applebee's is actually pretty great. Have had multiple good experiences here, usually because the staff is so nice and accommodating. Great family place especially with kids. I've been just with my young son and was really taken care of - the waitress was so nice to him. I also recently took a big party there on short notice and they didn't even flinch. They were super accommodating, and happy to have us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
5,Phuong T.,"Quincy, MA",16,54,167.0,3.0,2017-05-18,"I very much dislike leaving subpar reviews for businesses but my last visit to Applebees in Quincy left me disappointed. Our server came over to our table and cheerfully greeted us and took our drink orders. So far so good. She comes back 5-7 min later to take our food order. I'm a pretty simple and easy customer to deal with and let little things slide. Forget to bring silverware before the food comes out- I'm ok with that; we all forget things especially on a busy Saturday evening but chatting up a storm with a couple other workers rendering you oblivious to the patrons you had just waited on can be a tad annoying. Another girl brings our food out and we ask for the missing silverware and she speedily brings them over so things are copacetic now.  My gripe is that our waitress was sharing duties with another waitress which is fine but if you can't remember a simple order, communicate with fellow waiters, and prep a table correctly, then walk around with a notepad and use it to give yourself a reminder/checklist of things that need to be done and orders that need to be fulfilled. After her social hour was over she then proceeds to count cash/tip money?? on that same table. At no point during this span did she or anyone come over to do the occasional check in to see if everything is ok. We put in an order for dessert in the beginning and it didn't come out bc she forgot to put it in. At this point I'm assuming that her shift was over or she was on break; maybe she was working another section of the restaurant and simply lending a hand? Close to the end of our meal we see that she is back serving another table next to us. I hate to launch this diatribe because I usually sit at the bar and get wonderful service from Angelah who is super-attentive and professional. Food is what you expect from fast-casual dine-in chain so no complaints there. Hopefully a manager will read this and have a meeting with the staff to reinforce and/or re-introduce proper customer service skills.  I will be back to update this review over the next couple of visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,

3,Stephanie W.,"Cumberland, RI",324,111,193.0,5.0,2017-07-13,"My boyfriend and I frequent this Applebees whenever neither of us can decide on a dinner spot, and want something quick, and something we both know we'll enjoy. Each time we sit at the bar and the bartenders are extremely friendly, helpful with any new menu items, and our food comes out impeccable every time. Now this review is for the type of food Applebees is... it's not a 5 star fancy gourmet restaurant, so I'm not going to give less stars in comparison to those places.

4,steve j.,"Quincy, MA",0,13,,1.0,2017-08-08,"Sorry but this place blows.  At least when i went.  Several years ago i had a bad experience at the Quincy location and the Walpole one was no different.  Very slow service from beginning to end and food was horrible.  The chicken was like rubber.    I would have been better off eating my 10 speed bike tire.  I had stomach issues the rest of night.   It takes a lot for me to give 2 big thumbs down but Applebees brought it out of me.  On a side note, the bar looks good and the female bartender was polite and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-walpole,,,,,
