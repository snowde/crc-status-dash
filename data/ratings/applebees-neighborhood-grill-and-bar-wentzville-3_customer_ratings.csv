9,Sean P.,"Wentzville, MO",22,10,1.0,4.0,2012-05-31,"We have been here countless times and the staff and cooks are always consistent. We have never had a poor experience here; the food is always good and the staff is always on top of everything.  Also, the bar seating has multiple TVs to catch the game on.  Definitely give this location a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
7,Mark G.,"Saint Peters, MO",33,64,23.0,3.0,2012-10-03,New waitress at Wentzville location Sara first day on her own did a great job! They were out of featured beer pictured that I wanted an then out of cheese for the salad we ordered ?? Applebee's is to big a chain to be out of stock on anything let alone two items you wanted. I ordered a new dish cajun style that was not very spicy. If not for the excellent service most likely would not go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
10,Warren B.,"Wentzville, MO",0,16,1.0,4.0,2013-01-22,"No better deal in town then going there after 930, Half price appetizers!  They are all very good and love the wings because they are not soggy but crispy. Would give 5 stars but the staff at night is a little slow on the refills and they allow smoking after 930 but only at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
12,Kristin L.,"Florissant, MO",8,6,,3.0,2013-03-03,"Actually sitting at the table right now, Yelping. Just finished a mediocre ""2 for $20"". The 3 cheese chicken Alfredo was pretty tasteless, although there was quite a bit of it. My husband's fries were great, but the rest of the meal was simply so-so. I probably wouldn't have even bothered with a review, but when we went to pay, we had a bit of an issue. We ordered the 2 for $20 that was featured in their latest ad that had a coupon for $5 off a $25 purchase. Sweet! Seemed like a good deal. Except its not. Apparently, you cannot use the coupon with the 2 for $20 deal, even though it does not mention this anywhere on the coupon or the ad. When the (very nice) waitress explained that we couldn't use it, we (nicely) asked for the manager. He came out and kept trying to tell us it only applied to regular menu items. The 2 for $20 is printed in their regular menu. It is not an insert or special. It is offered in the REGULAR menu. he argued with us for a little bit and then finally said, "" I guess I'm not going to convince you, so I'll just take it off."" While I'm happy he agreed to honor the coupon, the manner in which he dealt with it was confrontational and left me rather annoyed. If he was going to honor it anyway, couldn't he have just said, ""Sorry about the mixup. We will honor it for you this time due to our error.""? Would that have been so hard? It would have made me a lot more likely to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,

5,Tim P.,"O'Fallon, MO",3,43,17.0,5.0,2015-05-11,"Great as usual.  Their Bourbon Street spices are perfect on steak and chicken both. Normally i do not like the cut of steak that they have but in this case, something in the  spice mix is a great tenderizer. Because the steak comes out on a cast iron skillet, it is ok if it comes out done a bit less than you prefer. Just cut it up and lay the pieces onto the skillet and in a minute or two they are done to what yuo want unless you like yours as charcoal. The GM from the Cottleville location was there as acting GM I guess and was working the staff up to the level of skill I have been able to expect from the Cottleville location for years! Big kudos to the staff! Do not care for the layout of this store because they ran out of table space on the floor design and jammed in 2 tops where most others have 4 tops. For a new store in a growing area this is a missed opportunity for the company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
3,Steven B.,"St Charles, Saint Louis, MO",0,23,3.0,2.0,2015-07-08,"Im writing this review for Yelps sake and I will just say...  I'm not too much of a fan for Applebee's.  Overall from location to location the food always seems to be subpar. The food is cheap... So I guess you get what you pay for but you always wonder, how did this become a nationwide franchise? The servers at this location are ALRIGHT.  The one male at the bar is always running around at the bar and tables never the ""attention"" they need.  I've had a good experience here and a bad experience. However, I still go here because my girlfriend likes Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
4,Roxie J.,"Wentzville, MO",8,38,11.0,5.0,2016-06-11,Great service as always! I've been here maybe 3-4 times after moving and I can't say I ever had a complaint :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,

Not only was the food beyond our expectations but our server Nikki H. was the cutest, most friendly person!! If you go there ask for her, she made our kinda bad day turn to a great one!!! Thanks Nikki!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
0,Jessi W.,"Wentzville, MO",1,88,85.0,4.0,2017-09-09,Late dinner. Last minute choice. We got the 2 for $25. Very reasonable portions. Onion rings were really good. Didn't even need dip. My steak was well done when I ordered medium well but that was the only negative. Boyfriend had the ribs and loved them. Server was friendly and the trivia games kept us entertained. I recommend the green beans as a side. Very impressive flavor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
1,Randy J.,"Littleton, CO",20,294,45.0,3.0,2017-11-29,"I was in Missouri this past Thanksgiving Weekend to visit family and friends when I stopped by Applebees.  It has a typical corporate menu, but the food was prepared well.  The place is well kept including the restrooms.  We ate at the bar in which the bartenders were just great.  If back in town, there is no doubt that I will stop by once again for a cold beer and more ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wentzville-3,,,,,
