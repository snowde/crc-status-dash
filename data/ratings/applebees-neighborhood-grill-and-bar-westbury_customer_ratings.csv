We only waited about 2 minutes for a table and we were promptly seated. The restaurant had the typical Applebee's decor.  Nothing special.  Basketball was on every screen.  We arrived just in time because right behind us was a rush of teenagers.   But let's get down to business here. The waitress was very attentive and quick. Definitely on top of her game.  We ordered a red apple sangria to share (buy 1, get 1) and 4 appetizers.  After 10 PM is half price!  That's right, half price!  We never see any need to set foot in an Applebee's before then.  So for the appetizers, the green beans were really good.  They came with a yummy dipping sauce.  They were crispy and hot.  We got the regular boneless buffalo wings.  Always a hit.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks and the beer battered pretzels which came with a cheesy sauce and spicy mustard. The pretzels were my least favorite.   The bill for the two of us came to about $25 which was fabulous.

15,Kathryn N.,"Glenolden, PA",35,42,4.0,2.0,2013-02-20,"While I have definitely had good and bad service at Applebee's before, this trip was pretty bad.  We were visiting my brother that goes to school in NY, and decided to go to Applebee's for lunch. Seemed like it would be a decent choice on a Monday afternoon. Not. While it was Presidents' day, and people were off, it should not have taken nearly as long as it did to get our food.   We got seated around 12:45 pm, and our food came out at about 2pm. Three out of the five of us got the soup and salad/entree lunch special. It's Applebee's, it's not like they are cooking the food fresh!  While we are assuming that our order was misplaced or something happened, because without having to be asked, the manager came to our table and comped the entire meal before the food FINALLY came out. While I applaud her handling of the situation, the waitstaff was barely ever seen, and they were pretty indifferent to the situation.  My favorite part of the whole ordeal was when the waitress was prompted with the question of the soup of the day, and she responded by reading all of the regular soup choices and chili.   I would suggest to not order the French onion soup, as it tasted pretty weird, and the Lemon Shrimp choice for the lunch was nothing to write home about. I will just stick with my usual after 9 trips to Applebee's for their Pomegranate Perfect Margarita and boneless wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=40,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

Standard Applebee's, plenty of parking. Always presentable, nice and clean. Service is great most of the time, every now and then you get the lazy ""I don't want to be at work"" type waiter/waitress. We have waited a while for our food here. Sometimes the manager comes over to ask how our dinner was, that's very nice of you sir! Food: lets start with the apps, as most of us do. My fave classic app are the boneless bbq wings....bbq sauce on these bite sides pieces of white meat chicken is super good! New fave app, grilled chicken wonton tacos, chicken taco in a wonton shell topped with slaw and cilantro....yummalious! These are my faves, but they have lots of yummy stuff like spinach and artichoke dip, potato twisters, and steak quesadillas towers. Moving on to dinner, always good, I usually get the fiesta lime chicken, tangy chicken served with tortilla strips, pico de gallo, and rice, so fresh, so flavorful, so good! I also like the zesty roma chicken and shrimp and the napa chicken and portabellas, both are really good! My honey will get steak or a burger from them and he is never disappointed.  Dessert: 3 words for you....Triple Chocolate Meltdown, chocolate caked with fudge in the center, topped with hot fudge and a side of vanilla ice cream....back away folks...this could be dangerous!!!  I love that applebee's has a weight watchers menu and a under 550 calories menu, think that's a really cool option.  Price is reasonable, they have 2 for $20 menu that is great!!

It was downhill from there. I made the mistake of ordering the riblet platter, which was just shy of inedible. I substituted onion rings for fries and was disappointed with them. They looked and tasted like frozen. The riblets were not good. They were tiny little pieces of bone with the odd scrap of tasteless meat clinging every now and then. They were drowning in BBQ sauce, which I am still burping at bedtime. I ordered a simple coke to go with the meal and it was so bad I had to send it back. Our server, Quinson, explained that there was some problem with the soda fountain and the syrup but it almost wasn't drinkable.

My fiancé ordered the sweet Asian pineapple burger, he enjoyed his food as well. We noticed a little ad on the table for AMC movie tickets from them for $9 (you can buy one ticket with each adult entree purchased) it comes out to $2.50 cheaper than buying them at the theater, which worked out perfect because we were going to the movies after dinner.

21,Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",384,156,255.0,3.0,2016-03-28,"I almost forgot about this Applebees because of their location being separate from the adjacent plaza of other restaurants. It was quite easy to find and I was able to find parking quite easily. Came here last night for dinner of 2 and we were told that the wait would be 20 mins to be seated. I found that strange because I saw that there were several seats at the bar open as well as five 2 people tables open. Regardless we sat down in the waiting room and looked at the menu. We were actually seated in about 10 minutes and were all ready to order by then. We went with the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and got the 3-cheese Cavatappi and Bourbon street chicken & shrimp. The mozzarella sticks came out quite fast however their quality was not the best. The cheese inside the mozzarella was a bit chewy for my preference and was served at room temperature instead of hot. The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was also not the best. The chicken was tender a tid bit juicy, while the shrimp was lacking flavor for me. It also comes with a side of potatoes wedges on the side. Towards the end of our meal, we had to search for our waitress because we were in a crunch to catch a movie. However throughout the meal our waitress was not very present with us, we only saw her once in the beginning and once our food was delivered, but then nowhere to be found when we were done.  Overall - This isn't really the place I crave to eat because it's comparable to below average diner food and even their ""healthy"" selections are typically not fresh tasting. However it is a nice place to hang out with a group of people and share different appetizers and entrees with.

65,K H.,"New York, NY",0,9,2.0,4.0,2017-07-23,"I came here at around 11:30 in the morning and didn't see that there were a lot of customers. I hesitated at first because the reviews online were a bit mixed, but I decided to give this Applebee's a try anyway. I was seated promptly and my order was taken. I ordered the Whisky Bacon Burger, which was delicious! Came put exactly the way I ordered it--medium well. The staff there are kind and as time went on, more customers showed up, so it wasn't a ghost town. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind popping in for another meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
57,Dan L.,"Glen Cove, NY",126,2,,1.0,2017-10-09,I don't know if the waitress we had was having a bad day or what. Got a bad attitude from her the whole time I was there. She seemed friendly to those around us though. The place wasn't packed but she seemed to disappear right after we ordered our food. She added an extra drink to our bill as well but seeing as it was $1 margarita I left it on there for fear of waiting another 20 mins til I got the check. If I was to go back and see her I'd go to a different restaurant. The waitress in question wasnt a kid either otherwise id chalk it up to her just being a kid. The rest the wait staff seemed lost as well brining the wrong food and drinks to tables. Mind you the place wasn't packed at all. Here's to hoping someone else doesn't get the same treatment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
49,Kristina R.,"Plattsburgh, NY",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"The guy at the front ""Peter"" is very rude and unwelcoming! We got seated, took forever to get the appetisers. I understand he wait time if they're busy. We got our chips and they're crushed. My fiancé asked for his steak to be well down, it came back pink. Lastly, they have a promo going on where if they don't mention the speciality drinks, you get a free app during your next visit. Our waitress did not mention the promo to is and when I brought it up to her, she doubted me over and over again. Alas, I dropped it and moved on. Applebees really need to step their game up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
53,Emma S.,"East Meadow, NY",3,25,2.0,4.0,2017-10-19,We went with a party of 8 for my daughters birthday on a Sunday at 5:30. We called about an hour before and even though it was super busy our table was ready when we arrived. Our waitress was excellent and so nice! Managers were really great too kept checking in to see how everything was. Food came out quick and was yummy Applebees burgers and boneless wings and what not. The house merlot wine was really good too. Excellent service and was a fun time. We go often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
50,Kathy P.,"East Meadow, NY",0,30,2.0,4.0,2017-11-11,Today being a holiday Veterans Day. It was crowded at 6:00. The reason is because this establishment gives Veterans a free meal.  To me that's an important thing when other restaurants do nothing. We stopped by at 4:30 with no wait.  Food is good for fast food restaurants but the people working here is what makes it worth it. Not expensive good portions tasty. Again I've been here a few times because it's better than a hamburger place for the same price. Bathrooms very clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

46,Jen N.,"Floral Park, NY",95,108,238.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"I used to love going to Applebees when I was younger but haven't gone for awhile, but I'm happy to say that the food and service is still great! Honestly I came back for the dollarita which (although expectedly watered down) is delicious and I could taste a bit of tequila. As for the food they still make my favorite: the chicken oriental salad which has a great variety of textures and a good crunch while still being sweet yet savory. Other favorites are the fiesta salad and the bourbon street steak. I also really love their triple chocolate meltdown for dessert which I have tried to replicate but in the end I must go to Applebees for the real stuff. The service is still great. My only complaint is that the electronic service tablet on the table doesn't seem to work really well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
56,Jay J.,"Hempstead, NY",0,6,9.0,1.0,2017-12-10,So I just left Applebee's and I must say I will never spend my money there again...my husband and I both order steak well done when we got the food but steaks were soooo uncooked. I cut into the steak and the blood from it was all in the mash and fries that I had for a side I didn't eat anything ...not to mention the food was cold. If I could give them 0 stars I would...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
47,Rich B.,"Roslyn, NY",0,8,1.0,1.0,2018-01-11,"Absolutely one of the worst meals ever...the t.v. commercials for all you can eat riblets looks great...the food is horrendous..riblets have no taste, are mostly bone, and very overcooked. Google riblets and they particularly make note of Applebees, explaining that the meat is not even from the rib but from the bottom of the pig...very unflavorful. Asked 2 waiters what kind of meat we were eating but they were clueless...fries were white and fairly uncooked...thai chili sauce was overpowering, honey mustard sauce lackluster. Table rarely cleaned, asked passing waitress a question and she had a super attitude...like why are you bothering me, it's not my table! My 24 year old son and his friends would never go to Applebees, they don't like the food quality...we were suckered by the ads...but won't get fooled again. As Marley said to Scrooge, ""Save yourself.""    Do the same and spare yourself from a poor dining experience. Go to a  real bbq joint for real ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
