13,Kristopher S.,"Waterford Township, MI",67,51,,3.0,2012-10-14,"Applebee's is becoming one of my favorite places to hit up after 9 PM due to their half off appetizers.  An order of Boneless Wings or a Quesadilla for 4-5 bucks!  Can't beat it!  Their wings are pretty good, and their quesadilla is phenomenal!  That being said, while I am a fan of their appetizers, I am not a huge fan of their entrees.  Their ribs are terrible and dry, their steak was terrible as well (felt like ground beef...I love a tender steak, but it was disgusting!).  They have a great Alfredo sauce, but their cooks don't know how to cook noodles (they are extremely overdone, and I am very picky on needing my noodles ""Al Dente"").  Their ""Chicken Fajita Roll Up"" however is excellent.  So - why do I give three stars?  As there are some things (like Quesadilla's) that Applebee's does very well.  And I am thrilled that I can get their awesome Quesadilla's for just 4 or 5 dollars any night after 9 PM.  That being said, I'd stay away from the majority of their menu...lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2?start=20,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007

For lunch they have a great menu consisting of pairing a classic with a classic, a classic with a signature, or two signatures, all for under $10. For dinner I believe everyone knows about the 2 for $20 and the 2 for $25 menu. The mozzarella sticks are amazing and the ""side salads"" are more like full portions and taste great. All in all the food is great and I would recommend to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2,,,,,
28,Jason D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",49,59,40.0,5.0,2016-02-28,"First off, why are you reading a review for a chain restaurant? You kinda know what to expect I'm writing this review because of the customer service at this Applebee's. The bartender and bar back that were working the night I went were super awesome, they deserved a wonderful tip and I gave them one. They were slammed with a full restaurant and a full bar, yet still were very calm and very attentive to each person at the bar.  If you want a good time, go to the bar at this Applebee's on a Saturday evening!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2,,,,,

25,Shane M.,"Royal Oak, MI",3,45,33.0,5.0,2016-05-12,"Last night (Wednesday may 11th) me, my fiancé and my daughter all decided to come up to Applebee's to check out this locations food and atmosphere. I could not believe that a restaurant like this has such great service and food. We got some drink and they were brought to us very quickly with our appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) which was a little too salty for my fiancé but I demolished it. Our waitress Alisha was great. She was helpful, fast, and very friendly to my daughter. We ordered the pick 2 for $20. We both got side salads which were bigger than most places I've been and not skimpy on the bacon, the perfect amount of ranch, and the right balance between lettuce and cheese. When we were done with our salads the food we ordered came right away and was still very hot like it JUST came off the stove top. My fiancé got the 3 cheese cavatappi and I got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. WOW! Is the words that come to mind. My plate came on a fiery hot cast iron skillet loaded with shrimp atop of the grilled chicken. Needless to say it was amazing. Looked exactly like or better than the picture. I was extremely satisfied with my order. Now here's the best part (for me at least) THE WAITRESS NEVER ASKED ME HOW MY FOOD WAS! And to ne that is the best service ever. I gate it when people come to the table asking you how the food is whilst I'm taking my first bite. Like ""idk I haven't tasted it yet"" lol 5 for sure! I can't wait to come back to this location again and hopefully  (fingers crossed) get Alisha as our waitress. I'd recommend this Applebee's to everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2,,,,,
23,Michael H.,"White Lake Township, MI",77,38,64.0,5.0,2016-07-18,"More than anything,  I like the company that owns this particular Restaurant as well as many in Michigan.  They are veteran friendly and also yelp friendly.  The management seems to be very good,  I have no complaints on how the Restaurant is ran.  Applebee's ahs become our favorite place to eat in White Lake. The food quality has significantly improved over the last year. We have had very few instances of food that was less than what we would expect from a great establishment.  I have had some awesome wait staff at times,  also had some awful wait staff.  The last visit,  we waited for about 15 minutes to get our server.  She claimed she had no idea we were her table.  Our food and drinks were delivered by different people.  We only saw her when the check was ready.  However,  this isn't the normal experience. We have noticed that the staff have been very attentive with their customers. While the wait to get seated can be long at peak times, they now have the staff to get orders served quickly and still pay attention to each customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2,,,,,
1,B M.,"White Lake, MI",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-30,Inept staff got order wrong for the second visit in a row and arrogant and uninterested management. They're very aware that pickings are slim in white lake and they don't have to deliver much on customer service or quality to keep a customer base. Car pick up to go is as bad or worse - last time (and I do mean last!) they kept me waiting 35 minutes (no lie) past my pick up time. Would have left but was already paid for via the web ordering website. Won't ever go back - three strikes is generous if you ask me!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2?start=20,,,,,

5,Kim S.,"Stanwood, MI",0,6,,1.0,2016-10-21,"We keep trying, but no luck! When is this restaurant going to get it together? I used to go to this restaurant at least three times a week, and the service was professional and great! Wow, what a change over the past six months. We keep trying, but are always disappointed by the lack of service and unprofessional staff. Walked in, finally was seated and waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge and know that we were there. The employees were more interested in talking amongst each other then concerned about customers! The employees, when not working the other night were sitting up at the bar sipping cocktails out of the kiddie cups. The employees that were working were talking to the off duty employees at the bar drinking. And when we cashed out, our waitress was eating chips from the spinach dip at the bar with the off duty employees! The new manager obviously oblivious to what was going on as she was having a personal conversation almost the entire time we were there with another female employee! Wow, disappointed as how bad they have let there service slip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-white-lake-2?start=20,,,,,

Can't comment on the food that much as it's a preset menu and I doubt the chefs have much creative control over it. They had alcohol, which is an automatic 3 star in my book. Then the waitstaff was extremely accomodating, so there's the 4th star. Especially to my odd request to get a side of sweet potato fries in lieu of chicken on my pasta.
