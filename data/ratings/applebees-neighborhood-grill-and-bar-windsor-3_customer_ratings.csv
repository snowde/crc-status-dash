I absolutely do not like chain restaurants.  And sorry, but Applebee's is at the bottom of my list of places I'd make a conscious choice to dine. However, my daughter received a gift certificate for a free milkshake so I took her to get it.  We were both hungry for lunch, and well, there we were.... we ordered lunch. I ordered the French onion soup and a salad, and both were surprisingly tasty.   She ordered the slider burgers, without the bun (something she picked up from her older cousin), and they absolutely KILLED those poor little pucks of meat.  They were charred to the point where I should have sent them back, but I didn't bother.  I let my daughter fill up on her free oreo milkshake, which was actually quite delicious. The service was not bad.  However, one of the ""manager"" waiters picked up some plates from a booth near our and as he walked around the corner past us, a slew of food fell off one of the plates... corn, beans... lots of little bits.  He never returned to pick it up.  As another waiter walked by, I cautioned him to watch his step, and then I realized he probably thought WE were the ones who made that mess, which makes me giggle a little when I think about it.   That other waiter came back with a vacuum and was very apologetic to have to vacuum right by our table as we were eating.  He was very gracious and sweet. Will I be going back to Applebee's?  Probably not.  But if I absolutely HAD to, I would order the soup and salad.  And a milkshake too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

It delivers exactly what it promises, noisy atmosphere on game day and all. Having said that, I like it here.  There is a consistent wait staff that are friendly and do their jobs right.   I get exactly the kind of food that should be expected here.  The food is just one step up from fast food.  But it's cheap.  This is not expensive dining.  I've never been displeased with any dish, from chicken to pasta to steak to salad.... but then again, I didn't have unrealistic expectations, either.  Your dinner is going to run from about $8-15.  They have a good 2 for $20 deal that includes an appetizer.  That's a pretty good deal.  The apps are half off during happy hour so you can get an $8 app for $4 so that's not bad either. The place is kept clean, including the bathrooms.   If cheap is what you're after, this will fit the bill.  If you want higher quality food and a matching ambiance, this is not the place to go.  Only a tourist would mistake Applebees for fine dining... come on, people...  It definitely delivers what you would expect from a sports diner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3?start=40,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064

As a whole there is just a cycle of laziness and unprofessionalism that makes eating at this particular Applebees a pain. I grew up loving whenever we went to Applebees as a kid and to this day am a huge fan of the food, but it just seems that too often, the service has taken too long on slow weekday nights, the hosts and servers have been unhelpful and preoccupied with their own thoughts, and the bartending quality, for those who enjoy going out to bars, is genuinely flat out poor. Most recently I had a late night bar tender doing nothing but talk to one of her coworkers while my drink just sat there waiting to be taken to my table some thirty feet away. When I asked the bartender about this her response was completely rude, sarcastic and unnecessary.

64,Laura B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-10-03,"We typically go to this restaurant once a month or so as a family outing. Applebee's is typical restaurant fare that is decent for a family get-together. The last two visits have been so bad that we won't go back to this location until we know they've shaped up. The service and food used to be good. The portions are smaller and prices larger, but the service these last two times was horrible. In September, the waitress was barely there and did not know what my parents' Golden Apple card was (a senior discount). She said thank you as if my mom was handing her a gift and then didn't apply the discount or return the card! When we inquired about it, she said, ""Oh!"" and reached into ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S CHECK wallet and took my mom's card out to return it! This time was worse. Our waiter didn't approach our table for quite a while and one of our party joked with him about it. He apologized and said he had been running all over the place.which we thought odd because we were the only customers in his section.  It took too long to receive our drinks and one drink had lemon instead of a lime wedge in it.  Not a big deal.  The appetizers were on time.  Then we waited and waited and waited for our food.  When our server walked by our table to take care of new customers behind us, he made no eye contact at all.  I observed him actually walking around the long way to avoid walking by our table, serving new customers their food while we still waited.  Finally it arrived, and when one of our party complained we were met with a bland apology and excuse that everything had to be timed to come out at once.  The two hot dishes were cold.  I didn't want to have mine remade because I didn't want to wait even longer or risk having it messed with in the kitchen so I choked it down cold because I was hungry.  A man came by with the rest of our food and commented that he had overheard our complaints but I'm not sure why he said that because he didn't apologize or do anything about it at all.  He was dressed as management. There appears to have been a change in ownership or management.  Wait staff are not trained and have no customer service skills at all.  Customer satisfaction is what will keep a restaurant open, and this location just lost six plus whoever reads the recent reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3?start=40,1.52,1.52,1.52,1.8280000000000003,1.5200000000000002

For anybody who doesn't know what celiac is, you can't eat any form of gluten, no wheat, rye, barley, and nothing gluten containing may touch anything he's about to eat or he'll end up VIOLENTLY ill. Then, the other night, we go and he's too scared to eat there so he decides to run over to Mary's to get a pizza that he knows WILL NOT make him sick like applebees did the last time, and they refused to let him in the door with it at all.

Don't go there.  I asked for a blackberry lemonade with a shot of vodka.  My 10 year old ordered the same thing without the vodka as it was originally on the non alcoholic menu.  When my daughter got her drink there were no blackberries as shown on the menu in her drink and in a large glass I questioned the waitress but her response didn't make any sense?  When I got mine I had blackberries in mine and was in a very small cocktail glass!  It was disappointing as I wanted the larger glass to cover the vodka taste and when I asked the waitress again she stated that it was small glass cause it came from the bar- but the drink originally was non alcoholic? We ordered our food from the 2/$25 menu-- what we got compared to the picture on the menu was a big disappointing letdown.  I ordered this mashed potatoes with cut rare steak that had gravy and onion rings on top.  What I got was over cooked meat 2 tiny onion rings and they threw on French fries?  In hind sight I wish I would have taken a pick of the food I actually received and a pick of the menu picture to post.  Someone else in our family ordered this cooked potatos with chicken breast that ( in the menu) had a light sauce with shrimp. Sorry I don't remember the names of the dishes.  What we got was a sizzling plate with raw onions the potatoes and onions were super hot like they had been microwaved ( the manager assured us they weren't). Chicken breast was warm with a pat of herbed butter on top of the chicken that was not melting?? No shrimp or the nice sauce shown on menu.

We were a bit surprised to see a chain participating in restaurant week but we decided impulsively to try Applebee's Neighborhood Grill as it is quite casual and that fit our mood. Applebee's offered a fix prix fixe dinner for $19.    My wife opted for the: Starter - House or Small Caesar Salad Entrée - Double-Crunch Shrimp Dessert - Blue Ribbon Brownie   I ordered the: Starter - Tortilla Soup Entrée - Blazin' Texan Burger Dessert - Blue Ribbon Brownie   The Caesar salad was not that small. The Tortilla Soup had a nice tangy spicy taste.   My wife enjoyed the large number of shrimp she was served. I enjoyed by 'burger' which was pieces of BBQ brisket rather than the usual ground beef.   The shocker was the Blue Ribbon Brownie dessert (only dessert choice) we were each served a dinner plate covered by two ample pieces of brownie and two scoops of ice cream. We were both certain the waitress had made a mistake and doubled our dessert order, but we were wrong. We ate most of the vanilla ice cream and took the brownies home in a container that was packed full.   Considering the low $19 price and the quantity and quality of the food, this was a very good dinner choice.

I proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes until somebody came and said that my order had been prepared with onions and they were having to remake it. At 7:37 PM I finally got frustrated and decided to go in and tell them to cancel the order as I had now been sitting outside in my car for a half an hour. I waited for five minutes to get my refund and just then my order was brought forth from the kitchen and I decided just forget it and take it with me. When I got home I opened the hamburger that took nearly 45 minutes to make and was incredulous to find that the burger I ordered without onions but please add pickles contained no pickles and tons of onions. So they could've save me a hell of a lot of time if they had just given me the original burger that they screwed up in the beginning since nothing had changed. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

It is amazing this place is even in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

My medium whisky burger (well that how I ordered it anyway) came out over overcooked and dry, without the whiskey sauce. I tracked down Kendra and she just stared at me.  Another waitress with obvious customer service experience stepped in and told me she would  have the cooks remake it. It finally came out well after my family had finished their meals. Kendra was rude and suggested my taste buds had missed the sauce on the first excuse for a burger. The burger was again over cooked, dry, and tasted terrible. I took one bite and left. Never again.  This place has gone downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-windsor-3,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
