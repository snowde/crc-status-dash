3,Jocelyn D.,"Woodstock, GA",7,74,3.0,1.0,2015-07-25,"By far the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. I've made the mistake 3 times of eating here. Never again. This particular time was by far the worst. Our waitress was so aloof. She took our order but then left before we could give our daughters order- I guess three year olds don't get thirsty? Then she took our order which she didn't write down and again left before we could give our daughters order. I guess three year olds don't eat here either. I told my husband she was going to mess up our order and of course she did. Our food comes out- and yes!! She forgot our daughters order! Anyone who's had the luxury of eating out with a preschoolers knows that the kid eats first or the dinner will be terrible. We were almost done eating by the time she got her food! My wedge salad was gross. How do you screw that up? The lettuce was brown around the edges, the bleu cheese crumbles were bleu cheese dust and the dressing was clearly hidden valley bottled crap. Have some decency and make your own dressing- or at least sandra lee it up and go semi- homemade. The sriracha chile shrimp was gross and the Kobe meatballs were worse.  She never took our menus, they just let our many plates clutter the table and not once was my drink refilled. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!  I will never--ever-- go back to this Applebee's. I'd recommend go to the McDonald's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodstock-2?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

Staff did not acknowledge we were there, or bother to attempt to seat us. They were not rude simply unconcerned with customer service. We did eventually get to a booth, it was not that crowded. We considered leaving at that point but decided to wait it out. Drinks came out wrong but not the end of the world. Food was delivered quickly and was ok. Wait staff must be new.

Disorganized and the staff seem as if they'd rather be anywhere but here. As guests, we had no clue who our server was as three different individuals had to be either called over to take our drink order or deliver our food.

Maybe 6 tables were occupied. We were seated promptly. And that is the only nice thing I can say about this visit. We sat at a table in the bar area for 20 minutes and NO ONE greeted us, spoke to us or even acknowledged us. The manager on duty walked by our table 3 times and made eye contact all 3 times - and never spoke. No one even came to get our drink order.

23,Todd K.,"Woodstock, GA",9,315,62.0,1.0,2016-01-30,"I don't give out many decent  ratings to mass corporate chain restaurants, but I feel this one is deserved. Btw I don't work for,I've eaten here with the wife three times, twice for lunch and most recently for dinner, and had good experiences. All three times our service has been attentive and friendly and food hot, fresh and tasty. On my most recent visit for dinner, I ordered the American burger, ""pink"". You can order your burger two temperatures- pink or not. I got mine pink and it came out perfectly medium and hot and crispy off the grill. It was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. Thick, hot and juicy - all you can ask for in a burger. Our spinach dip app came out hot and bubbly with browned parm cheese on top. Our server was top notch and on his A game despite it being a packed Friday night. Next to the outlet shoppes of Atlanta (apparently Atlanta now extends all the way into Woodstock and Cherokee county -WTF) so it stays busy and is convenient to shopping. Second review- After my most recent, and final trip here, I must update my review.  DON'T EAT HERE!!  I know several reviews say this and I now agree.  The floor of this restaurant on a busy Saturday night was the most filthy, disgusting floor I've ever seen. The health department certainly would not approve. Service was terrible and it took over 20 minutes to just get glasses of water. Not enough servers and no visible management is a bad combination.  I'm done and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodstock-2,,,,,

30,Gene G.,"Canton, GA",1,7,4.0,5.0,2016-04-18,I have no idea why these other reviews are so low. It may have had something to do with this being a new restaurant training a new staff.

15,Lilly C.,"Atlanta, GA",116,1153,5251.0,2.0,2016-11-05,Applebee's to me is just glorified fast food. Nothing super special and you can make a lot of their stuff at home. I live about a 10 minutes walk from this place and I have to say I've been here only twice. Location: this location has been opened for about 3 years now and I think the food has been okay and the service has been okay. Nothing to write home about! It's located in front of the outlet and has lots of parking. It's on the same side as Five Guys and Marlow's Tavern. It is packed on the weekends and on week nights. So you know sometimes there are no free parking spaces... To get into the place takes a bit of twisting and turning because you can't just turn into the place from right off the main road. You actually have to turn like you're going into the outlets to get in. Warning: there are no stop signs so watch out for traffic every which way. Most people are pretty courteous but occasionally you do have that one dick head! Food: it's your basic American cuisine with cheese on everything and a serving of little blandness. I had their lunch special a couple of times which is basically is a soup or salad with a sandwich which they have a lot of nerve to charge $10 bucks for. So if you are hungry and don't feel like eating McDonald's then come here. Otherwise spend the extra five bucks and go to a nicer restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodstock-2,,,,,
32,Megan T.,"Acworth, GA",0,3,,5.0,2016-12-17,"Just left this location. We sat at the bar and had the best service possible. Nan, if I spelled it correctly, was the best server/bartender I have had in a while. The manager one the other hand was very rude to him in front of numerous customers telling him to come run food, while the other servers were no where to be found. When I left there was 10 plus tables dirty and had been dirty for well over an hour. This is poor on the managers part as well as the servers who took care of those tables. I gave 5 stars because of the awesome service we received while he had a full bar and picked up everyone else's slack such as seating people, cleaning off dirty tables so he could seat people. I'm a server, and I would NEVER leave my tables dirty like this. Keep get your wait staff under control and the management.

We went over for lunch on a rainy Sunday and sat at the bar, as the place was crowded with others waiting for the rain to subside so they could hit the outlet mall (I'm assuming.) The bartender was friendly (the wait staff here in general are a pretty friendly bunch.) We got the 2 for $20 special. We got boneless wings for an appetizer, BF got the American Burger and I got the Caprese Chicken. The wings were okay. Nothing special, and definitely not spicy enough. But it's Applebees, so I get it. The burger was okay and, after requiting some extra balsamic glaze, my chicken was also okay. It was pretty bland overall, and I'm not sure why it is served with mashed potatoes and not pasta.

We ordered an appetizer, part of it was missing, just then a cockroach crawled across the table while the server, Erin, was standing at our table. I managed to catch the thing in a napkin, wadded it up and handed it to her. We placed our order and the food was good. I think something should have been done towards some minor compensation for the cockroach but it wasn't. Instead the little machine they put on the table to pay the bill had some charges for games we did not play added on to our bill. Erin said it had been on someone else's table where a child had been playing with it. She did take the game off our bill. I think the manager should have at least apologized but didn't. We used to go there regularly but it had been several months since we'd been and decided to try it again. May be a while before we go back.

19,Brandon T.,"Acworth, GA",85,4,,1.0,2017-10-14,"This is hands down the worst restaurant I've ever been to. My friend and I came in a few weeks ago just for drinks and decided to sit at the bar. After we got our drinks, the bartender vanished - FOR 30 MINUTES. When she finally comes back, she reeked of cigarette smoke and proceeded to tell us about the new Taylor Swift song she was listening to in the car. She see's we are irritated and ready to go by that point and says ""sorry I thought my friends would watch out for me..."" YOUR FRIENDS SITTING AT THE BAR???? No, not only did you friends not look out for you but neither did anyone else working at this restaurant. No one came anywhere near the bar for 30 minutes and they're we're full tables in the dining room!  Then last night... we decided to give it one more shot. I ordered the sirloin and my friend ordered the quesadilla burger. The food took long to come out so I new immediately my steak would be over cooked. Sure enough the waitress drops our food and without asking me to cut into my steak first, she runs off. So I spend 5 minutes waiting for her to come back (What happened to 2 minutes or 2 bites?) to show her my Well++ steak.  The manager there doesn't seem to have any idea what is going on.. ever. He walks around looking like a ""cool kid"" but never does any table side. He just saunters around the dining room trying to look important. When the server got my steak recooked, I told her to bag it Togo. The manager finally came out and took my food to the wrong table. How're you a manager and don't know your table numbers? When he found out it was our table he made some comment about how he was sorry that this was the 3rd steak they had to remake for me..... huh??? No this is the only steak I had remade what're you taking about? Then blamed the new line cook for the problems tonight. You can't blame your line cook you blame your KITCHEN MANAGER for POOR TRAINING.
