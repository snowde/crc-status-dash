16,Steve B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",3,22,1.0,2.0,2013-02-24,"Returning one year later, this Applebee's still gives the chain a bad name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
15,Deelilah J.,"Grand Rapids, MI",8,85,30.0,4.0,2013-08-21,"I go here pretty frequently and can't recall a bad experience. I assumed this was pretty standard but I've had some crappy food from Applebees' out of town which made me appreciate this place more. They cook well done steak well without it being burnt, service is always awesome and the drinks strong. If you like Applebees this is a good one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
0,Kayla D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,130,5.0,4.0,2013-09-30,"I don't go as often anymore, but the food is consistently good and at a fair price. I love going out with friends and watching the UFC fights they broadcast. We get an appetizer sampler and split between two, and they don't push you to order a ton of food for the couple hours we hang out.  The servers that work those nights are just as excited for the fights, and will make sure everyone has a place to sit even if that involves a little shuffling. On a regular night, service is quick and friendly. As far as chain resturants go, this is a good one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
14,Selena R.,"Eaton Rapids, MI",19,3,,1.0,2014-08-16,"I usually love Applebee's, this trip was the exception! The waitress was cute but we waited 15 minutes for drinks, we ordered appetizers and the table that was sat after us, ate before us! Not cool! The manager did take care of the bill, but I am not excited to go to another Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
17,Michael W.,"Wyoming, MI",3,3,,1.0,2014-11-23,"I generally do not write bad reviews, especially for Applebee's. That is why it kind of pains me to write this review. They have always had great customer service and excellent food. Today was a different story. It was right around 1143 am when we entered the facility. There was no one to greet us at the door so we had to wait about 2 minutes to get seated. Then we waited for almost 10 minutes and yet no one came to greet us or ask what we would like to drink. I would gave understood if we were a large party or it was the dinner rush. However; it wasn't even noon yet, there where maybe 5 tables full, and two waitresses standing around. They may or may not have been the ones for our area, but I still thought it was unacceptable to have to wait that long especially for what time it was and how slow they were. We went to Frankie V's across the street and within 5 minutes we had our food ordered and drinks in the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
13,Ashley S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,7,,1.0,2014-12-09,"Didn't even order food. I asked to sit in a booth and I was bluntly told no because server for the section was not there yet (it was 7:30 on a Tuesday). Looking around there were 2-3 open booths and I asked to sit there.... Again, I was told no because it was out of server rotation. At this point I just walked out. Very disappointed in the service especially coming from a chain restaurant with standard procedures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
12,Janelle P.,"Wyoming, MI",0,1,,1.0,2015-04-22,"Very bad service. I went for my birthday dinner and waited about 15 minutes for my drink. When we ordered are second drinks it took almost a half hour. When they brought them they forgot some. They told us they would b free, yet they still billed us for them. The food took forever and it wasn't busy. I honestly feel like my birthday dinner was just a hassle and irritating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
4,Tonya H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",44,5,11.0,2.0,2015-05-17,I come here all the time. .but Sunday night about 11pm after the Kevin Hart concert..we came and they only had two servers..The servers were goo..but this was total miss management. ..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
11,James P.,"Rochester, MI",111,9,,5.0,2015-08-06,"My experience here was great! Ask for heather as your waitress, she is super kind and quick.

9,Estera P.,"Wyoming, MI",106,40,8.0,3.0,2015-08-30,"The customer service here is ok, but not the greatest. I went here on a Saturday evening, it wasn't too busy, yet waited for about 5 minutes before someone came to seat us. The food was good and the waitress was nice, although a bit obnoxious. Ok experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
6,Kimberly N.,"Wyoming, MI",10,6,,3.0,2015-12-11,I think that if you place the computer at the dinning table and doesn't warn guess that you charge them is illegal. It's not a lot but I'm very disappointed that I got charged to touch that stupid tiny computer.  I will warn all of my family members and friends on FB so they don't get scammed the way I did.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
7,Sara R.,"Flint, MI",7,17,,1.0,2016-01-02,"Got there around 1030 pm on a Saturday  and waited for about 25 mins for someone to ask us about drinks. It wasn't busy, tons of servers walked by us without even acknowledging our existence. After 0 service we left. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
5,Weird R.,"Grand Rapids, MI",109,26,57.0,3.0,2016-03-06,"Great food, fair service, worst WiFi.  For good WiFi go to Sands next door or burger king, mcdonalds, of bigby's coffee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
8,Kevin P.,"Wyoming, MI",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-13,"How do you screw up a salad !!! Especially the oriental chicken salad? Oh it had the chicken but from what my wife and I figured out when we got home and looked on the online menu it was the thai shrimp salad , the dressing is a lot different,  we have not been there in a while and thought maybe they changed it , nope they made a big oops. Good thing she's not allergic  to peanuts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
10,Deb Z.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,81,,1.0,2016-11-26,"Wow where do I start.  My husband and I sat down and waited a very long time for the waitress.  Name? beautiful blonde braids.  They know who she is.  We ordered the pretzel appetizer, which came with NO plates, ordered waters and ice tea and coffee, and the straws NEVER came.  Ice tea was never refilled.  I had to ask another for coffee.  My meal was missing the pico, which after I asked she brought it out.  She never cleared the table of dishes and then she was done.  We paid with the debit card on the machine and left a very small tip 1%, then  pushed the button for receipt and it never came, even though the machine blinked for at least 5 minutes.  She never returned to the table.  We started to leave and I asked the hostess to speak with the manager, she was unavailable, on the phone.  We left, and I called and spoke with an ""assistant manager "" she said the manager would call me, well that never happened.  What  lousy service from a waitress and the managerial staff.  I think I will call Applebee's headquarters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
1,F Y.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,11,3.0,1.0,2017-01-28,"Inconsistent food. Inconsistent hours. If you come in the evening, the doors might be locked even if they are supposed to be open. Servers ignore you hoping you will leave rather than actually do their job. You are better off going someplace else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
3,Sunshine R.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,13,12.0,2.0,2017-03-05,"this was our first time at an applebees, the kids picked it as a special treat (my son keeps hearing about the kids eat free on the radio, we thought it was everyday turns out only mon-wed so that was disappointing). after ordering our appetizers it took like 25 minutes to get them which was a bit longer than I expected, she then took our food order which took another 30 minutes to get. I ended up deciding to order a blackberry lemonade when I ordered the appetizers, had to ask several times where it was, didn't end up getting it until I was almost done with my actual food, long after I ordered it. no reason or apology given, it was good but the wait for my one drink was ridiculous. my kids got chocolate shakes with their lunch and for $3 I was expecting not a huge shake but at least a normal cup size. the cup was small and 3/4 of it was whipped cream, there was barely any chocolate shake in it and for kids that don't like whipped cream they were very upset about it as was i. we waited around another 25 minutes after we finished for our bill and almost another 10 minutes for our change. the food was good but added with everything else it wasn't worth it. also the charge for the game on the table was unexpected, my 1yr old grab it before we could move it and I guess we were charged for that? no matter the reason I wasn't overly impressed with applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
2,Julie B.,"Grandville, MI",0,20,,3.0,2017-05-31,"We live around the corner from the Grandville Applebee's.  We used to go quite often as a last minute place to eat.  It has gotten expensive and the food items that used to keep us coming in, are no longer available.  They change their menu and take off items and add others in their place. We have not been there in awhile now and don't really think about going there anymore.  The waitstaff was always nice and the food came fast, but just not interested anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wyoming-3,,,,,
