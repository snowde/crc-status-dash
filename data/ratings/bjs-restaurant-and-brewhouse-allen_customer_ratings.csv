But most importantly the selection of beers is great, they have their own beer which i've tried several times and didnt really care for but their vast selection of local beers makes up for it.

161,Chassity F.,"Howe, TX",16,48,9.0,4.0,2012-01-21,"It has its good and bad. I went for the first time with a group of 8 on a Friday night. We had an hour wait and it was no big deal. We lost track of time so i asked the hostess how long was left and this was her reply ""We quoted you 1 hour and its ONLY been EXACTLY 53 minutes so hopefully within 10 minutes."" I asked nicely so I did NOT need attitude. A few minutes later they tell us our table is ready but we would have to site at two different tables. This was a female manager tell us that our group could sit at 2 half circle booths next two each other. Why would we go out as a group to sit separate? This was annoying! Finally we got a table! Server: I do not remember his name sadly but he was great with our group. Drinks: All the drinks we had were great! Our favorites were the Irish Root beer, Strawberry Patch, A Drink Like That (yes that's the name), Throw Back Cherry Cola, house Margarita. Food: Great! Large portions and yummy. I had BBQ pulled pork Sanchez and most of the people had burgers. I also had dessert. The baked bengiet. Almost as good as in New Orleans.

200,Barb N.,"McKinney, TX",32,219,97.0,4.0,2012-01-22,"Today, I was in the mood for something light.  Ahi poke sounded good and it was...Delicious!  We started the meal with a couple of beers.  I really enjoyed the franzar... hefeweisse dunkel.  It was so good with everything we ordered.  We shared the fried artichokes.  They are very very good!  The batter was very tastey with tartness of the artichoke.  Ahi poke is diced sushi grade tuna with avocado on a liitle julianned cabbage and the soy based poke sauce served with fried won ton triangles.  I love it!  My husband ordered a little salad with blue cheese dressing...kinda disappointing...iceberg lettuce, bleh.  Next came his ribeye with mashed potatoes.  Holy cow, that was wonderful!  Mm mm good.  The steak was a wonderful beefy smokey flavor and texture.  Steak is not usually my thing but I like to take a bite each time he gets one!  This was one of my favorites.  The steak and mashed potatoes were a perfect pair.  There was a hint of horseradish in the potatoes and they were so thick and creamy.  It was so good he gave me several bites of both.  YUM! This was by far the best meal I have had at BJs.  SO GOOD!  I can't wait to go back.  We may order the exact same thing again. Normally I would order the avocado eggrolls and possibly share a little pizza.  Although you can't go wrong with those, I'm glad I strayed from the norm today. Our server was named Kyle.  Good guy, great server.   The little salad brought my rating down.  If it weren't for that, this visit would have gotten 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=200,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.248,3.2800000000000002
175,Ken C.,"McKinney, TX",0,14,,3.0,2012-03-10,"Definitely a mixed bag at this particular location. Our most recent encounter: dining with 2 kids is always a practice in patience, so we take advantage of call-ahead seating when available.  We were told 20 minutes, so we took our time getting there and arrived at the 20 minute mark.  When we checked in, we were told it would be about more 15 minutes.  When 15 minutes elapsed, we were told it would be 5 to 10 more minutes.  (Granted, they were very busy.)  Here's my request though: if it's going to be 45 minutes, tell me that when I call so 1) we can plan accordingly, and 2) the kids don't get restless. We had pretty much decided to leave when the GM (Jennifer) talked us into staying, and I was actually glad we did.  The food was delicious and portion sizes were perfect if not on the bigger side.  Had we been given accurate information about seating time, I would rate this 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.1480000000000006,3.2800000000000002
204,Katsya A.,"Lubbock, TX",0,8,,5.0,2012-05-03,"Food is the exact same at both Allen and Frisco location. We originally had went to the Frisco location since it is closer to my boyfriend's place, but we had some seriously rude service there... stiff body language, curt short answers, eye rolling, deep sighing while I looked over the menu one more time after my boyfriend had ordered...after my appetizers were dropped off, my boyfriend suggested that we call a different server over and have him get us our check for the drinks and small plates that I had ordered and to cancel his entree. Yeah. It was that bad. I really enjoyed my chicken wontons, but that waiter really put a damper on our evening. So I finished them quickly, we got our check, paid, we left. I really like BJ's food, so we decided to drive over to Allen. We were seated immediately, and our waiter Brandon more than made up for our crappy waiter in Frisco. He kept saying ""my pleasure"", which I thought was kinda endearing/a mark of a new waiter, but that's neither here nor there. He was so adorable and prompt. I had ordered a few small plates for my meal (more thai chicken wontons!), and a few minutes later, he came back to ""regretfully inform [me]"" that the kitchen was out of chicken wontons and ""would [I] like a menu to see if [I] wanted something else"".  I've worked in restaurants, I understand that things run out. The way he handled it was so very professional and empathetic--he didn't roll his eyes or sigh once while I looked over the menu some more to pick out a different dish. No tapping of his feet, no deep sighing, nothing to indicate that he had ""better things to do"" than wait on me. I finally decided to go with some stuffed mushrooms instead of wontons, to which he said ""my pleasure"" and he hurried away to go put that order in.  Stuffed mushrooms were delicious, my other small plates were tasty (the meatballs have a liiiiiiiiiittle too much pepper in their marinara sauce), but that was easy to overlook with such a fabulous waiter. I'll be back and request you, Brandon. Please make sure ya'll have chicken wontons in stock! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=200,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.2840000000000003,3.4000000000000004

I would have to say that there are only a couple of knocks against BJ's;  1)  the wait can be long (but you have to expect that to a degree for any good restaurant). 2) it can get load at time.

120,Matthew C.,"McKinney, TX",210,312,64.0,2.0,2012-06-07,"I wont slam them, I won't slam them......Oh! sorry just praying for some patience. I took my family to B.J's for my son's graduation dinner on June 1st.   We had a party of 10 and had called ahead for seating (what I was told to do when I called earlier in the week for reservations).   It made no difference, as they wouldn't seat us until our party was all there.   Apparently the group behind us had parties showing up to their empty seats after we were seated.  How is that?  I frikkin called ahead and had to wait, looking at my empty and already set up table, until all of us showed up.  I decided to go with the flow and not get upset.   The service and atmosphere were very good.  The waitress was very nice, though she disappeared once in a while for a few minutes too long. We ordered a variety of things:   My wife ordered the ""pot stickers"" appetizer (6 chicken pot stickers w/ dipping sauce).   Looked good and was tasty.  For what it was, the price was a bit out of bounds, being $6.95.   She also ordered the lettuce wraps, and she ate about half of it, and boxed the rest to go. The Mom in Law  ordered a ""Crispy Chicken sandwich"".  It looked good, but she only ate half of it and picked at the second piece of chicken in it.   The chicken looked like the ready made breaded tenders you get frozen at Walmart.  She said the wedge fries were good.   The burger had heat wilted (from the chicken) shredded ice berg lettuce on it which made it look cheap.  She didn't box any leftovers. The three boys with us ordered medium (12inch) deep dish pizza's for a whopping $17.25 each.  Ouch!   They eat like horses, and neither had eaten more than a couple of slices before we left.  These got boxed, as I know they will eat them later.   The youngest ate the rest of his later that evening. I ordered the T.v. advertised ""Crispy Jalapeno Burger"".   It was nearly cold when I got it, the same issue as the Mom in Law, wilted crappy ice berg lettuce.   The patty was not hot, not seasoned well, overdone, dry, and not good tasting.   I would have been happier with a Big Mac.   This two-part dinner set me back $10.25 cents.   The fries were good!    The beers and drinks are tasty.  I usually won't spend $5.50 for a beer, or $6.95 for a glass of wine.   Did it this once to please the ladies.   Dang!

From there, I had maui fish tacos and my wife had a vegetarian pizza.  I also had a small side salad with the fish tacos.  There were only two fish tacos so I would not necessarily say that I left full. Because I did not leave full, we were talked into a dessert that was a heated berry affair with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that was unreal.  It was very very good.  It has been so long since I have had any hot dessert ice creams.

199,Michael G.,"McKinney, TX",5,3,2.0,1.0,2013-06-30,"1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were given a pager to let us know when our table would be ready. When our pager went off, I handed it to the hostess who wasn't too interested with us. In fact, she took our pager and didn't say ONE WORD  or even make eye contact with me while we stood there waiting for another person to seat us.. Long hard day-I just dismissed it as stress. The waitress was pleasant for the most part. She took our drink and appetizer order and simply told her we would order our food when our appetizer came out as we were waiting for one more person to arrive. Drinks came and she told us our appetizer would be ""right out"". Few minutes later, a server brought it out. As we were enjoying our appetizer our waitress did not come by to take our order. In fact, as she was taking another table's order, we HAD to flag her down to come back and take our order. 2 people in our party ordered a pizza. I ordered ""Fish & Chips"". As I gave her my order, right away she asked me if I wanted ""wedge fries, thin fries, or regular fries"". Told her I wanted ""wedge fries"" along with a side salad. She then asked me if I wanted my salad before or during my meal. I stated that I'd like my salad before. Few minutes passed as we were finishing up our appetizer. She came to refill our drinks at one point. She prepared our table for the arrival of the pizza, and dropped off some ketchup and malt vinegar. Then another time she came to take our appetizer plate away. As she took it away, I asked if my salad was on it's way. She told me it would be right out. How long does it take to make a salad? It took about 10 minutes and me asking before my salad came out... Again, I dismissed it as a stressful, busy day. Couple minutes later, my salad finally came out. At which time she said our food would be right out. 2 bites into my salad my entree arrived. Since I was the only one with an entree (the other's shared a pizza) and I was trying to enjoy my salad, the server asked who the platter was for. With my mouth full of salad, I raised my hand and said it was for me. Just as fast as he set our food out on the table, he was gone. HOWEVER, he brought me ""Shrimp & chips"". Who eats shrimp & chips with malt vinegar?? When I saw our waitress, I flagged her down and told her I was brought shrimp & chips instead of fish & chips. She then reached down and grabbed the plate and told me she would bring it back with no apology or anything. At this point, I'm thinking this establishment needs a serious ""customer service"" adjustment. She came right back and finally apologized and told me my food would be right out. She brought my food out and everything seemed fine and dandy. HOWEVER, I expected a simple explanation or another apology about the mishap. but it never came.  When this happened (unfortunately) before at the Alliance location we've had a manager come out and apologize for the error. We were even offered a free pizookie. The Allen location didn't seem to care. In fact, after signing the receipt she said thanks for coming, and mumbled her way away from the table. We didn't know exactly what she said because she wasn't focused on us but focused more on the next table.And Not ONCE did she acknowledge her mistake again, or tryto make up for it. Granted she did come out (eventually) with the correct plate, she made us think we we're in the way or were bothersome.  Lack of customer service and courtesy is the reason why we tipped only 10%. My rating would've been 5 stars because of the food, but the lack of ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" deserves minus 4 stars as we we're NOT happy I'll come back to this location, but I seriously hope to get better customer service and never get that awful waitress again.

I have probably complained twice in my life at a restaurant about a meal or service.

However, we waited so long for our food, and some came out warm at best, and the pizza our friends got, was not even hot.  We waited mind you over 30 minutes for our food, and on a not so busy night seems not right, and not once did management ask if we were ok.

119,Christopher W.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-15,"I generally enjoy BJs but I think last night's experience has effectively removed them from my list of options in the future. My wife and I arrived to find the restaurant somewhat crowded, not unusual for a Friday night. We were told that inside seating would be 10-15 minutes, but if we were willing to side outside (in deteriorating weather) that we could be sat immediately.  Not expecting a long stay, we opted to sit outside. Apparently saying ""outside is fine"" is BJs-speak for ""I have influenza"" as we were sat in the farthest corner from all other patrons and were completely ignored at that point, without a single member of the staff inquiring as to whether or not we had been helped despite food delivery and clean up going on at multiple tables in the area. Thankfully I was amused more than upset.  After about 20 minutes, I called the restaurant's carry-out ordering number and asked to speak to the Manager. After waiting for a few minutes, I finally reached him, explained that we were already seated and asked if he could help us get some service.  He said someone would be out there right away. About 2 minutes later (way too long, given the circumstances, unless I caught him on the toilet?), he and a waitress came out, and finally we had our orders taken, ordering much smaller items than usually as we had little faith in the rest of the experience going well.  The manager also offered a free appetizer. I thought I had seen Dorothy and Toto fly by in the wind just a minute prior, and would have preferred an offer of an indoor seat instead, but the gesture was appreciated.  My wife was ready to leave but the experience was like a train wreck so far, and it couldn't pull myself away from it in case they messed up again. I wasn't disappointed. After waiting about the usual amount of time for our food, our entrees arrived, yet the appetizer never came. Refraining from laughing, I asked about the status of that particular item, and the server said he would check. A few minutes later, the appetizer finally arrived (potato skins) but they were overdone and very dry - oh well, they were free, we can deal. The rest of our food was good (burger and a sandwich) and at least one thing went right - the appetizer was indeed removed from the bill. The waitress was also friendly, but seemed a bit nervous - perhaps she was new? We still gave her a healthy % for what I hope was a unique experience. Overall, a terrible yet amusing experience that marked the end of my trips to this particular chain.  For those visiting this location, I recommend you get a drink at the bar before being seated to help you mellow out before your ""dining experience"" begins!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.116,3.0400000000000005

It was crowded at the bar so we had to wait at the front.  When we were seated my husband and I started with fried cheese sticks.  My husband picked them since they don't serve queso.  I really get overwhelmed when a menu is a book or when a restaurant is American fare and serves everything.  I asked the server what they liked to eat,  so I took his recommendation of the chicken lettuce wraps.  They were good, were light, but filling.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was OK.  There was nothing outstanding about this place to make us go back, unless a friend wanted to meet there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=120,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.38,2.96

There was a decent crowd but it quickly dwindled around 8:30pm.  David was our server and did an okay job of being friendly. I was hoping they'd have some type of reverse happy hour (even though I promise I don't drink ;p) but they didn't.  Tried the calamari (around $10) and it was nothing spectacular. It needed salt. The wind (which we miscalculated to be much calmer than it was) quickly chilled us and our appetizer which didn't help the fairly bland flavor of the dish. It was served with a pretty ""mayo-y"" aioli and a marinara sauce.  Tried the Mediterranean pan pizza (around $16) after being steered in the pizza direction by David upon contemplating between a pie and a burger. I ordered it with extra pesto. The dough was good. The toppings were ehhh. The peperoncinis could be replaced by onions or something else with bite on this pie. The Kalamata olives and the peppers were competing for flavor punch. The dough would have been even better had it not been so dry - even though I asked for a little extra pesto, I barely got any. I ended up requesting some on the side (it was brought out ice cold but was tasty and did the trick at wetting the thick dough). Tried a slice of the chicken bacon ranch pie and also filed it as ""okay."" The menu offers up a decent selection of different food items (wings, pasta, steak, ribs, burgers, salads, sandwiches, seafood dishes, pizzas, etc). I've tried the grilled chicken pasta before but wasn't impressed. The next time I venture in I'll try something else - their double burger.

It did little to add any flavor.  The avocado was real soft and I thought it was guacamole (I even looked).  The skinny fries are a nice touch, but next time, wedge cut fries.  The club that I am used to has three slices of bread.  This sucker had two thick pieces which added to the blandness and dryness of the sandwich.

I ordered it Medium and it was perfect! Being a Sunday afternoon, it was pretty busy. The service overall was pretty good, but I had to be on the lookout for my waitperson a time or two. The atmosphere was great. Lots of energy. Plus, there were plenty of screens to watch some football! BTW, they have a large variety of beers, especially local brews.

It's like buying a Pitt bull but getting a rat terrier in strength.Yeah, both are loveable dogs but that's about it in similarity. The  fried calamari appetizer was pretty decent. I mean, its a fried food. Just b/c you are in the south doesn't make you an expert, but the batter was decent and the calamari was pretty fresh. However, it is a franchise so how good can you really make it?  Then we ordered the Mediterranean pizza (deep dish, large). Decent pizza; crust similar to that of Pizza Hut's (PH) pan pizza. Although PH is cheap, it's so much more delish...b/c it's cheap. But if I'm paying $25 for a large, i rather take my money and go to Whole Foods.

150,Shari J.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,2015-09-01,"Went to the Allen location yesterday with a co-worker for happy hour.  We have a few happy hour items, drinks and then get the bill. My co-worker has the mobile app that allows payment etc.. So after the bill is split between food on one tab and drinks on the other ($12.99 food and $16.99 drinks), I give my card to pay the food tab which I agreed to pay. The server swipes my card and brings back the slips for me to complete the sale. She takes the competed bill I've tipped and signed for and my co-worker stated that they've already paid their check on the mobile app. The server stated that she had to look for the mobile app transaction because she could not see it as competed on her end. She goes back to the computer and brings ME back the check I'VE already had my card swiped for and says that the check paid on the mobile app HAD PAID THE CHECK MY CARD WAS SWIPED FOR and closed the ticket..... So the higher bill was unpaid. Huh? I was  confused as to how another payment was allowed to be processed and closed out on the same ticket whilst another payment was still processing. I also did not understand how she couldn't find the payment from my co-worker but all of a sudden it was closed out and off of her computer. The server said she wasn't sure because of visibility on the mobile app being private. So I was assured that the payment swiped on my card would not process so I paid the $16.99 tab. The manager came over and gave about just as poor of an explanation as the server did of why the mobile app allowed two payments to process on one check but allowed the mobile app to pay and close out the wrong ticket completely. How do you not have any knowledge of the app related to services within your establishment works? Well after the server hands me back the original ticket I thought I was paying for and says that it won't go through because she didn't close the ticket out I am a little peeved because that is not the case. Both transactions were processed on my card... Even though supposedly one check had already been closed out on the app. So I do a little research on the app and see that it allows the person to split the check, pay for whatever they want or NOT pay whatever they want. My co-worker stated that they paid the balance that was left after my card was swiped..Interesting....that would mean the balance would've been $16.99.  So there's a red flag. Where is the disconnect between the mobile app and the restaurant's financial / reimbursement process? How does the app allow a patron to control the closing out of payments? Isn't that the servers job?  BJ's in Allen  Tx owes me an explanation because I'm furious. It's not the difference in bill totals that is my issue; it's the principle and lack of accountability by the staff. Not to mention the mobile app allowing the account holder to divide the check between anyone ordering on the same ticket to their liking/advantage  and giving them the ability to give the illusion that they've divided fairly but actually allows manipulation of the system that has now created a bad taste in my mouth with the restaurant and a suspicion of dishonest behavior from my co-worker. I'm going to contact the technical support for that mobile app and see if I can get my questions answered. I'm sure they have visibilty to transactions that are linked to table or ticket numbers especially when a 20% discount from the app was applied to the sale. What if a stolen credit card was used under a fake profile to pay for a check on their app? I'm going to also write a formal complaint to their corporate office for the lack of training and inability to correct the situation or truly show that they understood their app process in the first place. No app should allow the closing of sale by a patron until all payments have processed accordingly or allow another method of payment to be allowed to process on the same tab simultaneously when there is already a payment still in pending status that has not been cancelled by the MOD. I just want a true explanation and accountability; from all involved if the arrows point in my co-workers direction as well. I am EXTREMELY angry with this situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=140,3.0,3.1,3.1,2.404,3.0600000000000005

But whatever~ the food came out fairly quick and just how we wanted it. The stuffed mushroom is by far my favorite appetizer here ever! A must get if you love spinach & mushrooms!  I tend to try a lot of different things here every time I come, the pizza is good, the pastas are good, and the burgers are good. I specially had a shroom burger that day which was very satisfying. I wish we had room for their famous pizookie (giant cookie in a pan with ice cream on top) but I was stuffed.  Overall, thanks to the manager that made up for the lack of service we got.

Mind you this is still my father bday, so we asked about a bday dessert. He ordered one, then the server said they were out of that kind. So he ordered another kind and then we waited another 20 mins. Really??? What crap! As we were leaving, after paying over an $90 dollar bill with tip. I mentioned to the server we never got the damn bday dessert. She said hold while she gets it Togo. Then she came back and said unfortunately it went to another table. If we waited another 2 mins she could get it to go. That was it! 2 mins to get it after 20 mins of waiting and 90$ later? This place and service is a joke. My dad was so let down.

Our food came and it was good.  The food was warm and prepared well. Refilling the drinks was not part of the deal I guess, since the waiter didn't really come back too often to check on us.

5,Amanda R.,"Plano, TX",50,232,778.0,2.0,2017-02-19,"First time ever eating at BJ's. Started off on the wrong foot with the hostess.  The table was dirty and still had the previous guests payment on the table.  I told her this was a dirty table and needed a wipe down. She said it was clean. Returned with a dry napkin and wiped the table sending crumbs to my lap. What a bitch move. Seriously.  Our waiter moved us to another table. Hard to move on to greater things after being treated as non-worthy customers.  Internally, I was fuming. I'm angry and ready to just leave. My friend says ""I'm hungry up to you"". Girl talk translation means enough/feed me.  My friends salad must've been really good. She would have licked the plate on that Asian salad had it not been over board. I had the blackened shrimp tacos. The sides were awful. Chipotle sauce, greasy chips, and some green tinged mayo avocado sauce. The tacos were good. They also offer flavored teas. Which are good if you can get them to bring you a refill. States unlimited. I got one refill. (Fail) The menu is like reading  ""War and Peace.""  It is overwhelming, way too many options. Doesn't appear that they have one speciality food that makes them shine.  They do offer a large variety of beers. Our waiter without a name tag provided ok service.  Never been here and you guessed right, don't think I will be returning. Absolutely nothing here grabbed my attention as wanting to be a repeat. I perused the web site and found this  ""We are an award winning company with an ""of service"" culture, anchored by solid hospitality and guided by our compass of quality"".  That is so laughable!  2017/23",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen,3.32,3.07,3.07,2.536,3.17
6,Terri J.,"McKinney, TX",130,344,579.0,1.0,2017-02-26,"Update: visited on 2/24 around 6 pm. Was not acknowledged for over ten minutes. Ordered a steak medium rare. Steak came out medium well instead. Tried to get a waiter to take it back but gave up after 20 minutes. Partner also got a steak medium and his was also medium well. We decided to get a pazookie and it took over 25 minutes to come and ice cream was completely melted. Such a disappointment. Wanted to use mobile app to pay and it doesn't work. Downgrading to a one star as the food and service have completely gone downhill apparently.  ***************** Ok. So I'm updating my review as promised. Chris, the GM actually reads Yelp, and sort of cares about what we think, which I find pretty freaking refreshing. So thanks to him reaching out to me, I took my Manchild and our two kids, who weren't with us last time, back to BJ's.  I signed up for the online app which gets you lots of perks. Through there you can check to see if there's a wait, and tonight at 5:30, there was none. When we got there three minutes later, there was a ten minute wait. So I'd say that wait list thing needs improving, but we were seated by 5:40, so it wasn't a big deal.  Service was excellent this time around except for the very beginning. We didn't get silverware until after the salads came and after asking twice. Other than that, it was a flawless performance. Victoria was a doll and she smiled the entire time.  I got a wedge salad and it was great. My hubs got a sirloin that he said was better than Texas Roadhouse, and for him that's like the highest praise ever. It was cooked PERFECTLY. The pic makes it look small, but it's a thick cut and he got a salad (not pictured). We both had cheddar mashed potatoes but you couldn't really taste the cheddar, which bummed me out. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken, which, in all honesty was not great. I'd seen pictures of this crispy chicken dish and what I got was drowned in lemon sauce and soggy. It still tasted fine, but wasn't my favorite.  So here's the real update: I originally stated in my review that this place is basically just Cheesecake Factory. I stand by that, but here's the deal: unlike at the Cheesecake Factory, I didn't have to wait an hour. I didn't pay $18 for that chicken...I paid $13. This place is far more kid friendly, something we didn't notice when we came here the first time. It's not as fancy as the CF, and that's good for our 4 person family. The kids menu here is pretty fantastic. Plus, the cookie pazookie is just something everyone has to experience.  I can't give it five stars. It needs tweaking still, but I can say that before the GM reached out if written it off. We just left and we are already coming back to watch the game later this week without the odd and try out the happy hour specials. It's progress that wouldn't have been made had the GM not reached out. So thank you. Get the salted caramel pazookie and thank me later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen,3.16,3.06,3.06,2.404,3.1000000000000005

Maybe in a cast iron skillet would have looked more authentic. My son ordered Broccoli cheese soup in a bowl. We both had a Caesar salad.

They were out of the pazookie we wanted. That coupled with the well-done prime rib should have resulted in some sort of discount or compensation.

My wife and I went here for lunch on Sunday, since it was early in the day we did not have any of the good beers they offer. Our waiter Christopher F came to our table in introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We both asked for Ice Tea and I also asked him if he could bring me a packet of sugar since I only wanted a small bit in my Tea. A couple of minutes later he brought us some Ice water and took our order. Someone else brought our meals to us. Christopher came by a few minutes later during our meal to ask how they were and asked if we would like refills on our drinks. I told him we would love refills on the Ice Teas he never brought. He said he was sorry and walked away and came back and filled our glasses. Mind you I was polite when I said this to him. When our meal was done the bus boy came and cleared our plates. Christopher came by and dropped the check at our table and said thanks and walked away. And yes the Ice Teas were on the bill. I had to find him and ask him if he had any clue what good service was because the Ice Teas were still on the bill. He took it and walked away and came back and dropped off a corrected one. Never one word of apology. The meal was very good and I can get good meals at lots of restaurants, but the service is what makes us go back to a lot of places. When people ask why so many restaurants close down I tell them there's a good chance they had poor service. Also when done we could not find a manager to talk with.

41,Martin M.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-08,"This is my personal experience this afternoon and you should take this review as such.  Running errands I stopped in for a bacon cheese burger and fries. Ordered and was asked if I was okay with the burger done Medium Well (defined by the food network as 145 degrees with 3 minutes rest or between 140 to 150 degrees). I took one bite and then looked at the burger and found it dark on the outside and red throughout. Not pink in the middle, but from the layer of black on the outsides to red and uncooked inside throughout; it was raw! After I pushed the entire meal away and asked for my check I was offered to speak to a manager?!? Why would I debate uncooked food with someone is beyond me. So I said no, give me my bill and left a 15% tip over full price for a burger that had 1 bite, that I describe as a perfect home for a parasite. This is my personal experience today. If you enjoy this place I say good for you and please don't let me stop you from enjoying but as a local who has visited this restaurant as part of his weekend ritual before running errands this place has gone down hill.  Oh, the triangle napkin placed on the bar prior to my plate being served was filled with crumbs, so clearly I received an unwashed napkin used by who knows how many previous customers. I should have left then.  I am not returning there and want nothing from them in way of apology or free anything.
