426,Sherry V.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,228,,4.0,2012-01-10,"Wow, they've really revamped their menu. Every entree shows the calorie count next to it. Extremely helpful, though I'm sure most people try not to look at it. I tried the Chicken a la fresca from their ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu. Marinated chicken breast w/ rice pilaf and a ratatouille with Dijon taragon au jus on top. That sauce was flavorful and light. I felt good about resisting their pizzas for once. But at the end of the night, I did share the red velvet pizookie. I wasn't a big fan of it-- I think the white chocolate chips have got to go. Red velvet w/ cream cheese mixed in the batter and vanilla ice cream on top should be sufficient enough. If they wanted something diff, they could've added cheesecake flavor ice cream on top or something. But the white choco chips just straight up made it too darn sweet. Bleh!

I remmeber back in the days, I came here with a group of friends before the Valentine's Formal because Olive Garden was too full. Oh, high school.  Anyway, this BJ's has since gone through a nice renevation, complete with flat screen tv's everywhere. They also have delicious beer, delicious drinks, and even the food is not half bad.

This place gets BUSY FAST.  There's a cocktail bar located in the center of the restaurant, which is great for watching any type of sports game. I ordered the fish tacos, but they weren't that great. Avacado egg rolls are delicious. I think the pizzas taste better here and definitely order the pizooki with white chocolate macadamia nuts and vanilla ice cream. I don't really eat chocolate, so I eat around it and it goes great with vanilla ice cream! MMmmm. Servers are quick, which is good.

My parents got to the restaurant first and put our name down for reservations. They hostess told us about 30 mins. We waited for a good 40-50 minutes before we were called... a group that came before us, also with a party of 5, got seated way before we did. So we were finally seated at this awkward shaped corner booth. We got our menus and was trying to order, but it was SO DAMN LOUD in the restaurant. There was a birthday party for a baby right next to us and the baby was screeching and yelling because she wanted to take off her shirt. I understand she's just a baby, but as parents, shouldn't they have done something about it? All they did was laugh and point for a good 10 minutes of the screeching until they finally let the baby do what she wanted to do.  So we order amidst all the noise and chaos and receive our food. The food was good and portions were enough.  What we hoped would be a good family dinner, turned out to be a chaotic, noisy, out-of-control dinner.

My mom was with us and was in a wheelchair, it didn't fit at our table, so she had to get up and sit in the booth, it was difficult.

442,Gabby T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,31,27.0,1.0,2012-02-17,"Came here for Valentine's Day at around 7 and the place was crazy busy. The wait was an hour and a half but better than the 2hrs at Olive Garden.  A lot of people didnt show up so our wait was more like an hour. Our waitress's name was Lydia and she ruined my dinner date, along with the lack of quality in the food. Lydia was the type of waitress that made you feel bad for asking for anything extra and i dont really appreciate that when your expecting a tip. She gave me attitude when i didnt like the watered down iced tea and asked for less ice next time. When i asked for lemon she actually slammed them down on the table, b/c she had more stuff for the next table. i was truly appalled by this and couldnt believe this just happen.  My boyfriend's medium well steak was OVER DONE and BURNT and his mash potatoes were thick and dry. He didnt even eat half of it. My pasta limone was just ok. BJ's is famous for its pizookis so we couldnt leave without having one. So over the awful customer service, we decided to order it to go and Lydia had the nerve to make us feel bad about our decision. She said "" the one you ordered is already out of the oven, so you're going to have to wait another 10 minutes for another since you changed your mind. is that alright?"" we got our red velvet pizooki, which was way TOO sweet, and left. She did not get a good tip and ruined my dining experience. It's not my fault you got stuck working Valentine's Day, so dont take it out on paying customers.

The salad was actually nice and cold (just the way I like it) along with a pizza that was sort of deep dish. Also, during lunch time, their beer on tap is $3.50 which was a great deal.

It was empty in the restaurant so I was baffled but got over it. A few minutes later he brings appetizer and then introduces us to our new waiter since I guess it's his break time. The new waiter was really freindly and only tasked with bringing our order out. So he brings our food but noticably missing is my entree. I waited and nibbled off the appetizers thinking it was just taking longer to cook the non pizza stuff. Finally when he came to check up I knew something was wrong. I asked about my entree and he said Oh let me go check if it's ready, he then comes back and says oh it was never put in,I'm sorry..would you still like it.  I mean HELLO,I was so shocked but wasn't starving because there was a mini pizza&appetizers still to eat off of. So I just said yes because I was looking forward to it. It came out but I really feel like he should've asked when he brought the food the first time if everything was here.

435,Santos L.,"Pasadena, CA",2,5,,1.0,2012-04-01,"This place is a complete disappointment.  I've been here at least 4 times within the past 3 months, with co-workers (their choice).  Why I thought this place might get better, I have no idea, delusion perhaps. The first time (around January) we came here for Monday Mojito specials.  The bartender seems to pour the mojito from a pre-made mojito jug.  Tastes like lemonade with mint.  I suppose this is what you would expect with a 5 dollar mojito.  Do not come here if you follow a Vegan diet.    All times I've been here I've scoured the menu for anything vegan... Thus far a salad is the best option.  Now let's get to the salads... I ordered an Italian market salad (Minus all meat and diary, seemed like the best choice for toppings) When I received the salad it was  99% ice berg lettuce.  The said toppings were meek, and sad looking at best.  Kalamata olives looked as thought they had been sitting outside of the jar for weeks (A gross light brown color).  Minimal tomatos, red bell peppers, and pepperoncinis.  On top of this all I found pieces of bread in my salad, very small pieces... (why?) Bread was no where near the description of the salad, very weird and disgusting. Other than expecting all disappointment from a chain like this, I will say, If you are into and expect a mediocre time, with mediocre (at best) food, mediocre service, mediocre drinks, and mediocre music, by all means go to BJ's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=420,3.12,3.4,3.4,3.0120000000000005,3.2880000000000007

291,Jack C.,"Long Beach, CA",193,195,104.0,4.0,2012-05-27,"BJs is a classic for me. I've been frequenting this place since high school, but the one thing that the economy, specifically the recession, has affected is the size of their free birthday pizOooOOkies. Before, way back when, it came as a full entree size, but now they shrunk it down to a mini. I'm still not gonna complain too hard on free. Those things are delicious btw. Get one with half chocolate chip and half white macadamia nut. That'll satisfy your sweet tooth ferociously. The pizzas are really where it's at. You absolutely can't go wrong with the BJ's favorite. It's deep dish and served in just that a deep dish. Others that I've tried that are also worth mentioning are the classic combo, and BBQ chicken altho the bbq chicken was a bit too tangy for me. Their salads and other appetizers are just okay. The italian sausage and basil flatbread is surprisingly good.  They have a generous selection of beers to choose from and service has always been great. If you want to catch a sports game of some sort they got tv's plasters all around the restaurant.

I didn't go to BJs expecting any out of the ordinary cuisine for that type of chain. However, this was so far below standard that it was stupefying. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich (sans tomato), which bore the following description : ""Lightly breaded tenderloins of chicken, fried to a crispy golden brown and served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll with honey mustard, green leaf lettuce and sliced tomatoes."" Sounds delicious, but that isn't what they brought me. The Roll : NOT a garlic cheese French roll. Plain French roll; forgivable.  Honey Mustard : A layer so thin and hard to see that the CSI folks would have a challenge detecting it. Green Leaf Lettuce : Wilted, brown corners. The Chicken : The greatest offense of all. Fried strips, that were so sparse on chicken I had to use my knife to scrap of slivers from inside the layers of their deep fried cage.  I tried to choke it down, I really did, but only consumed a quarter of it. I blame the fact that I didn't send it back on my personal shock. I figured the consolation prize would be sharing Cate T.'s whipped potatoes. She and I were mortified when we recognized that they were made from an instant powder.  Being the twit I am I allowed them to box my meal. It'll look prettier going into the nearest trash can ? The glorious Coup de grace ? The finishing fracken stoke of genius ?! An hour of vomiting.

Saw a good amount of people waiting outside and inside.. already didn't like the look of it..but on we went! Walked inside, and it was pretty tiny! I was expecting it to be big..but meh. We only had to wait about a good 10-15 minutes, not too bad.  We got seated on the outer area near the windows, AC on blast! Our waiter James was a pretty cool guy. The first thing he asked me was..are you wearing Daisy Marc Jacobs? I was like ... O.O YES.. First time a dude knew what perfume I was wearing. PROPS JAMES, PROPS! Kind of made things a tad bit awkward, but all gravy.  Bf got himself the Blonde Beer, and I tried out their strawberry mojito. Honestly, it was super duper sweet and extra fizzy. Didn't really like it.  Bf was craving fried calamari for the longest..and me not liking seafood, I woman-ed up and tried it out. Tasted like chicken! So I can say I like it..because it doesn't really have a distinct seafood-y taste.  I ordered the turkey cobb, my fav, and bf got the burger melt which might be my second fave. I actually give them more props for being so quick with the food and service! Our food was out within 10 minutes or so. BJ's up in Torrance has never been that quick. I was pretty surprised.  I always ask for no lettuce on my sammiches and hamburgers, and my sammich came with the shredded lettuce. I gave the -__- face, but James noticed it right away. He was gna take it away and have them make a new one, but I didn't want them to go through the trouble. Good waiter.  We inhaled our yummy food and we were ready to bizzounce.  Our bill totaled up to 48 bucks and some change. 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=200,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.2800000000000002,3.4000000000000004

Half a decade later, my coworkers decided to go here for lunch I had no choice but to give it a second chance. Came in a party of 6 and was seated in a corner both with a TV on. If my boyfriend was here, he'd love it since he can watch a sports game... but for me and my coworkers... it didn't mean much. Food came out pretty fast... for my coworkers that is. I think they forgot about my order. I think BJ's just has it out against me. Waited a while and then the manager personally came out to give me my jambalaya after we had asked about my order. But.. I guess the jambalaya tasted pretty good, so it was (almost) worth the wait. Portion was huge, I took the leftovers home and it was enough for dinner. Waiter seemed okay to me... but my coworker said he was rude to her (I guess I wasn't paying attention when that happened).  So I guess overall, it was a okay experience. Way better than my first at least.

The waitress wasn't super attentive but she was very friendly. She also honored a special offer that we had (since we were BJ's club members). I usually like ordering the Grilled chicken/broccoli/cheese baked potato, but this time I had their thai mango salad. It was delicious with the right amount of avocado. I also tried my BF's burger and skinny fries and it was just as good.  I also recommend their pizzas, although I haven't had any as of late.  As for the drinks: BJ's also has great berry cider, and they serve Wyder's ciders too! These are my Go-to.  As for appetizers, I recommend: the avocado eggrolls, the spinach stuffed mushrooms (although it won't be too filling), and the nachos. (but be forewarned, that is over 1000+ calories).

455,B D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,18.0,1.0,2012-10-14,"Wish I could give 0 stars. NEVER GO HERE!! This was literally the WORST dining experience I've ever had.  We went as a group of 5. 3 of us got there at about 1pm. By the time the other 2 of us arrive 30min later, they still have nothing at the table. I ask ""you haven't ordered yet??"". They say they ordered drinks 20min ago.  It takes 15 more min for our drinks to arrive. We sit at 2 tables, so we ask if each table can use a coupon, since we're separate bills. She says sure. One table orders soda, lemonade, mini pizza, & large pizza on one check. The other table gets soda, burger, & large pizza. About 10min in, someone brings the salad that comes with my burger & puts the pizza-holders on our table. 1hr later we still don't have entrees. The table next to us has sat, eaten, & left.  We've now been @ BJ's for over 1.5hrs. It's not even busy. When we finally get our food around 2:45, one of us asks to pay her part of the bill b/c we've been there so long that she needs to leave. We want to try the new raspberry pazookie so we order the trio-raspberry, Ghiradelli, & oreo.  After another 30min, it arrives & we realize we've been given the macadamia nut instead of the raspberry. We eventually flag down the waitress-who has basically ignored us since we walked in. We tell her we think we might've been accidentally given the macadamia.  She rolls her eyes & rudely says 'it IS the raspberry'. We reply that we can't taste or see any berry. She says 'they're just raspberry SHAVINGS'. We dig thru the cookie to show an obvious lack of anything berry, & she tells us they're in there but YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.  We then tell her it has macadamia & she says 'no, they're almonds'. We hold up a piece of macadamia & tell her that it has macadamia in it, so isn't it the macadamia one? She insists that the raspberry one HAS macadamia, so it IS the right one. We ask ""are you sure, b/c we thought it said it only had almonds"" & she replies ""NO, it has MACADAMIA NUTS"" ""and almonds?"" ""AND almonds"". We tell her that we can't find any almonds in it either, so it must be the macadamia one, & she finally huffs & barks ""so what, do you want ANOTHER one or something?"" ...yes, we would actually like the dessert we ordered (especially since that one was the only reason we ordered dessert at all!). SHOCKING. We get a menu from the front, & we're right - the raspberry only has almonds. Not only did she make an error, she ARGUED with us about it & BLATANTLY LIED to try to push the blame on us. What if we'd been allergic to macadamias? Would she have just kept insisting they were almonds?? She didn't apologize for the wait, the error, OR for blaming us for her error. She brings the bill 15ish min later-we still don't have our last pazooki.   She's put everything on ONE bill. Not only that, she's TOO LAZY to type a new bill once one of us had left, so THAT PERSONS'S mini pizza & lemonade are STILL ON THE BILL. She hands it to us & tells us to take off $12.95 (the cost of the mini pizza) & walked off. Totally unprofessional! The whole point of the bill is that it's a record of what you pay, not a random amount. AND even if we took off the cost of the mini pizza (& the lemonade!), the TAX for those items was STILL on our bill! To top it all off, instead of $4 off on each of our pizzas, she had only taken $2 OFF. We decide to speak to the manager. We explain everything.  Instead of apologizing, he says OUR COUPON IS WRONG, & that it's actually SUPPOSED TO BE $2 off a MEDIUM. Shouldn't his first reaction be 'I'm sorry your service today was AWFUL & your waitress LIED TO YOU & you've been sitting here for HOURS'?? We say no, it's $4 off & we didn't order mediums! He says again that we're wrong. We pull up the coupon on our phones-which clearly says $4 off a large or share-size pizza. At this point the CORRECT raspberry pazooki arrives - it looks, smells, & tastes totally different & has obvious red splotches of raspberry, NO MACADAMIAS, etc. He comes back 15min later with 3 checks. He says the trio will be free (we assume as an apology for the CRAP service we've had).  There is a bill for our friend who left & already paid, & bills for each of our 2 tables. He says the coupon isn't working, but he'll just take $2 off each bill (he crosses out the amount & writes an amount $2 less beneath it).  ....except that when he split them up, he put the original -$2 & -$2 on the receipt of our friend who left! So he took $4 off HER bill, but she had already PAID IN FULL, so she didn't get that discount! I ask about it.  He says ""well I GAVE you free desert for $9.45, so it comes out the SAME"". So the pazooki WASN'T free, b/c with the extra he charged us & the tax on that, we ended up paying $6-$8ish of that anyway. As we're walking out the door-more than THREE HOURS after the first of us arrived - a guy working at the front says ""So sorry about that, guys."" This is THE FIRST TIME someone has apologized to us THE ENTIRE TIME. RIDICULOUS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=480,3.48,3.38,3.38,2.244,3.4200000000000004

I have never been unable to finish a meal simply because the food was unappetizing.  Since BJ's is pretty much the only restaurant open around the area after 10:30, the bf and I decided to stop by for a Friday night dinner. I was surprised at how many occupied tables there were. Apparently high schoolers like to come here after their Friday night football game, dressed in their cheerleading and football attire. They are half the reason why the atmosphere at BJ's is so loud. So we were seated and given a very large menu with an incredible amount of choices.  Ordered the avocado egg rolls, small barbecue chicken pizza and the california burger. The bf ordered a hot tea which was basically hot water, a packet of honey, a tea packet and some sugar (and that cost almost $3 when you can get much better tea at any Asian tea shop!)  The avocado egg rolls came out and while they looked good, they didn't have what the description stated they would have ""Crispy golden wontons wrap a tantalizing blend of avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices. Served with a sweet tamarind sauce."" There were no sun dried tomatoes or cilantro or pine nuts! All I could taste was the avocado and the heaviness of the egg rolls. I ate two and that was two too many. The egg rolls must not have been cooked all the way, but I got an incredible stomachache and was unable to eat anything else after that.  When the pizza came, I took a few bites but not only was the bread incredibly dough-y and tasteless, it was really disgusting! CPK's pizza beats BJ's by a hundred percent and even Little Caesar's $5 special is better than this garbage.  And when the bf's California burger came out ... it was on sandwich bread and looked really unappetizing. It was incredibly heavy, which ... I guess I can't say anything because what do you expect from an American restaurant? But it just tasted bad! I have never had that much inedible food left on a plate from a dinner/lunch ever! I felt really bad when the waitress asked if she could take anything away or if we were still working on it. I mean, it's not her fault the food sucked. I asked for a box for the pizza, but I honestly will probably not eat it. It's currently sitting in the fridge awaiting its fate in the dumpster. My stomach was so uneasy I couldn't eat the pizookie that my bf and his sister had ordered. I just sat there drinking ice water, waiting for them to finish so I could go home and use the bathroom.  One of the reviewers mentioned that there is happy hour from 10 to close and there is $2 off appetizers? I didn't get $2 off the Avocado Egg Roll! Looking back, I do wish I had said something about the taste of everything, but I was in such a hurry to get home I couldn't even think about that. The waitress was nice though, and when I had asked about the $2 off any small pizza Yelp deal, she said I had to sign up for their Rewards program. She ended up giving us a free pizookie instead of givign me $2 off the pizza, but oh well.  I just thought the entire meal was too heavy and just not great. I was pretty disgusted by the inedibility of the meal and the fact that I couldn't even get through half of it.

It was happy hour, and we sat at the bar for the happy hour specials, and we ordered from the happy hour menu, while asking about what they may offer for happy hour drinks. See where I am going here? Then when we get our check we notice, she didn't give us the happy hour price for one of our orders. When. We ask her about it, she says ""oh you guys were looking off the regular menu so I assumed you wanted the regular order. Because this spinach artichoke is actually bigger than the happy hour one. So I billed the regular not the happy hour one."" What ever happened to asking instead of assuming? Needless to say we did dock her tip since, this ""mistake"" shouldn't have happened in the first place. Why would we order a regular-order when we ordered everything else on the happy hour menu while asking about the prices about items on the happy hour menu. All I wanted to do was get a snack, not pay 30+ for a mistaken meal.  Another thing is, different servers passed by at least 15 times before my little sister had a refill on her empty soda. This was a good 15+ min, we were near the kitchen so they were passing us a lot. Oh best part was, there were about 5 groups of 2-4 people in the restaurant total. So we didn't come in at a super busy time.  I did notice the waitress chatting it up with the bartender most of the time though.  For the service and the handling of the situation, I don't think I'll go to this branch of BJs again.  And who serves warm beer?! It was sitting on the bar top for a while before it was given to our table. Never coming here again. I have had better service elsewhere. This particular location left me disappointed with the BJ's chain restaurants.

First Visit Our server must have been new because: 1) Lunch took two hours to get through 2) Our soup took so long to get to us that by the time we got them, it was lukewarm and our accompanying entrees came shortly after (not enough time to enjoy our soup before entrée). We even had an inconsistency with soup spoons, some were soup and some were serving spoons that were too large for the bowls. 3) Long time to refill drinks; instead of bringing us a brand new glass, he'd just grab our old glass to refill after forgetting the first time. 4) Mix up with our rewards program card. It was switched with another party's rewards card. Second Visit 1) Our server would check in on us, but never stayed long enough to hear our responses. We lacked napkins, accompaniments for our dishes as well as answers to questions about the food we ordered. 2) The cloth napkins were wet because the utensils inside was wet when they wrapped them... we waited a long while to get paper napkins... after consuming chicken wings.... 3) The Piranha Nachos sucked, all of the ingredients were on the bottom, except for the cheese (which was already lacking)  4) The pazookie was supposed to have two scoops of ice cream, which is actually one   vs. their stock photo posted on Yelp  5) Ice chunks throughout our scoop of ice cream  The Arcadia location really, I mean REALLY is not up to par with other locations I've dined at.

After a rough day of drinking a little too much the night before, sleeping only 4 hours to go on a hike that I couldn't even finish (my own fault for not resting the night before) and having a bad reaction to my new allergy eye drop, I ended up in bed all day without eating anything. I finally felt good enough to eat and leave the house at almost 9pm so I decided to call in an order for a BBQ chicken chopped salad and buffalo wings from BJs. What a mistake... They placed me on hold for 5 minutes. A girl, whom I later learned is the shift manager, then picked up and asked to take my order. I had 2 simple items that I've ordered regularly and the phone conversation took forever. She wasn't paying attention! I was telling her what I wanted and was interrupted when she said goodbye to an employee leaving saying ""bye, see you tomorrow!"" while I was talking! This happened a few times and she kept repeating my order and asking me questions that I already told her the answer to. The whole thing including hold time took almost 10 minutes. I have never spent that much time ordering 2 simple dishes to go in my life. I got there 15 minutes later and my order was ready. The girl asked me to go ahead and add tip and sign my credit card receipt. First of all, why are you asking me for a tip when it's a to go order? It's not even curbside. Plus my phone experience was so horrible that I wouldn't leave a tip anyway. I got home and my order is wrong! I have always been a fan of their BBQ chicken salad. I have been ordering it for years. It comes with BBQ ranch dressing with BBQ sauce drizzle on top. My salad had regular ranch tossed in and no BBQ sauce. How can it be a BBQ chicken salad without BBQ sauce???? Now I'm so peeved. I called and asked for the manager. She still didn't pay attention to me. After I told her my issue, she asked to place me on hold. She then came back and said ""would you like us to reimburse you since we didn't put enough BBQ sauce like you wanted?"" Is she f-ing serious? I just finished telling her that my salad had regular ranch instead of BBQ ranch and no BBQ sauce at all. So I guess she's right since no BBQ sauce is definitely not enough BBQ sauce? She wasn't even apologetic until I asked for her corporate office's phone number. She ended up calling me back a few minutes later saying that she has adjusted my credit card to give me credit for the salad. She then mentioned that she is very sorry and even though I said I would never visit their location again, she hopes I would consider giving them another try. Funny thing is I never said that. She didn't even pay attention to what I said. I can't believe this girl is a manager.

I was drinking a Coke (which is dark) so I didn't even noticed until I had taken a few sips. I tried getting our servers attention for 10 more minutes to get it replaced. I was very polite about it and even apologized for requesting a new glass. Our server was rude and snatched the glass off the table. When it came time to pay, the four of us needed four separate checks. Now, I'm a sever and i know how to split checks efficiently, it isn't complicated if you enter the orders under the correct seat number in the first place. And even if you don't it's an easy fix with the managers help. He asks us to split it, use a calculator, write down the last four digits of our card numbers, all this unnecessary crap. When we give him the calculations, he returns and tells us we didn't add in the tax. Are you kidding me? That's not either of our jobs - that's what the computer does. Ugh, anyway.

It's a great spot to choose if people in your party don't know what kind of food they want. And it's an easy place to accommodate parties of higher numbers. I went to this one recently to meet a friend for dinner and dessert. I wasn't particularly hungry so I ordered the mozzarella tomato salad, and had a glass of the moscato. I really enjoyed the salad: it was light, and crisp and cool on a hot night. The moscato was a bit too sweet for my taste. My friend ended up ordering the white chocolate pazookie; she let me have a bite and it was really good. The reason I'm giving this three stars is because the bartender kept rushing us to make a decision on drinks, dinner/dessert, and to pay the check. There wasn't a huge wait by any means.

The patty was huge & it was tasty if you like lettuce, tomato, & onions w/ it. I couldn't eat it w/ the whole wheat bean because that alone was heavy. The pizza was smaller, way smaller than the box, & pretty basic - green bell peppers, mushroom, black olives, onions & of course cheese. You can add additional toppings for $1.

I came here with the girlfriend and her sister during happy hour in the middle of the week. We sat in the bar area, because that's the seating eligible for HH-prices. If it was normal hours I would have sat else where. So we get our waitress who takes our order and tries to be upbeat about it.  We get order 3 appetizers and drinks for each of us.  We get our drinks probably 10 minutes after ordering.  Normally this would not be that big of a deal except for the fact the place was near empty. What hold up is there between taking your only customers' order and bringing it to them. Our waitress was no where to be found. It was actually another server who brought us our drinks. 25 minutes later we finally get our food, again from another server. The girlfriend's sister got the endless root beer and either that was false advertisement or the waitress didn't care enough to give her a refill. It basically ended up being a 5 dollar root beer.  When all is said and done, I get the bill. I'm scanning it and the numbers don't add up. After sitting in the bar just to get the HH-pricing, the waitress rang us up at NORMAL hours and NORMAL portion prices.  We were basically served the HH portioned food but charged full price all around. I stop the waitress and I ask her what is going on. Her response basically clinched it for me, ""Oh you weren't looking at that part of the menu so I assumed you wanted the regular one"".  Working retail myself, I know that if I ever make a mistake it is my responsibility to own up to it and make amends for my mistake. Instead, this girl tries to say it was my own fault. But how could I have known the pricing until after the food and drinks were consumed?  I have never tipped less than 15% at any restaurant, no matter how poor the service is. It actually pains me when I give any less. But this was the ONE exception. I reluctantly tried to put down the normal 15% tip but my girlfriend angrily looked at me to ""tell"" me otherwise. I left like 5% and walked out the door shaking my head.  No excuses for service so bad. You weren't rushed. If you thought I meant to order the larger portion, you could have ASKED... or actually given me the normal portion if that was the case, not charge me more for less.

Thank goodness we asked if it was gluten free and didn't trust that they would bring out the right food. We had to send it back for the gluten free pizza and wait another 20 minutes. After about an hour 20 mins, we realized it was NOT WORTH THE WAIT- greasy (literally the pizza was drenched in grease), nasty texture, no flavor, HUGE globs of cheese.

247,Craig C.,"Temecula, CA",9,34,14.0,1.0,2014-01-02,"Our group of 6 was looking for a light dinner after the Rose Bowl game and agreed on BJs Brewery because they were located between our two hotels -- also because I've been to their Temecula location on several occasions and was never disappointed. I wanted to show our MI guests a nice restaurant with good food, atmosphere, and service. Everything started out great with no waiting for a table in the bar, waters delivered, and our drink orders taken.  After a few minutes, and as expected, our server delivered our drinks, with the exception of mine (everyone was drinking beer or wine and I ordered a diet Pepsi).  No big  deal, except it took her about 10 minutes to finally bring it out.  I survived and would not downgrade an establishment for that.  After placing our orders, our server promptly brought out our salads, which mine was very tasty.  After bringing out 4 of the six people's main entree, our server told us they ran out of the size pizza my wife and I ordered so they were making us a larger one, but it wasn't done yet - they need another 5 minutes to finish it.  We said no problem, we can wait while the others start their meals while they are still hot. After about 10 minutes the server and manager came over to apologize and said it was taking a little longer to cook the medium pizza and offered us some bread or salad while we waited for our food.  We declined and said we can wait a few more minutes.  As you can probably guess where this is heading, the pizza finally was placed in our table 30 minutes after they said it would only be 5 minutes. The rest of our party had already completed their meals, and of course everyone was exhausted after spending the entire day at the parade and football game. My wife and I offered some of the pizza to our guests because it was too much for us, and we ate as fast as we could so everyone could get back to their hotels.  The worst thing about my experience is that this specific pizza wasn't very good.  It seemed dry and not warm enough for my taste.  I've had this same pizza at the Temecula location and it was always excellent.   When the bill came I really expected the pizza, that was 30 minutes behind the rest of our parties food, to be taken off the bill.  I guess that was my fault for expecting them to do the right thing.   Based on my total experience, I probably won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=220,2.44,2.92,2.92,2.6280000000000006,2.728

I was here with just another person, so I was thinking that the wait would be short. We decided to eat here because we use to enjoy this place when we were both in college. Also, I was craving some good pizza. I haven't been here in a while, but I remember really enjoying the food. HOWEVER, I was very disappointed.  To start, I ordered a bowl of tomato bisque, side of wedge potato fries, and small pizza. It was a rainy day, so I ordered the soup. It still tastes great, one of my favorite places to order a tomato bisque. The side of wedge potato fries were very disappointing. This dish use to be served with sour cream, chives, and shredded cheese. Unfortunately, they just serve the fries alone unless you request for certain things on the side. Lastly, the pizza was horrible. I've been to other BJ's and I've enjoyed their pizza....even this location, before. I wasn't sure if they were just busy and overlooked my pizza, but after reading other reviews...their flaw appeared to be consistent. I ordered a small pizza and split it with a great white and sweet pig. The pizza came out lukewarm...not even hot at all. That was real disappointing. I felt like the dough itself was still raw. I probably won't come here again for their pizza, but maybe other items here are still good.  The service...I have mixed reviews. My first waiter was great, he stopped by and refilled out waters and checked in to make sure everything was fine. However, he took a break and switched out with a waitress. Once that happened, we were ignored the rest of the night except when she rushed us to pay the bill. Her name was Erika.

383,Starr G.,"South Pasadena, CA",20,6,,1.0,2014-05-06,"My experience with one of the closing managers on 5/5/14 was a disappointment. The manager had the worst attitude I've ever experienced at a restaurant. My sister and I ordered for curbside a little after 10pm. The manager took our order and told us to call the curbside number when we got to the restaurant. We arrived at Bjs in Arcadia and called the curbside number. She told us that she forgot to mention that curbside ends at 9pm and we need to come inside. My sister and I decided to drive to Arcadia solely for the fact that they offer curbside since her son had fallen asleep in the car. The Pasadena location is within closer proximity to our house, we would've went there to pick up food if she had remembered to mention the curbside hours when we called. Ultimately, driving to this location served no point as the manager who we spoke to ""forgot"" to mention curbside hours were until 9pm considering we spoke and placed the order after 10pm, which is over an hour later. She did not consider to call us back either to let us know. In regards to our food, our order of grilled chicken pasta, the manager refused to pack a container of shredded Parmesan cheese, instead she gave Parmesan packets for pizza and told us ""we don't do that here."" I have been to this location before and mentioned that I did not have problems with receiving shredded cheese with my order before. She responded, ""I'm sorry but employees were not suppose to serve shredded cheese."" Apparently a small ramekin of shredded cheese will not be given under any circumstance, she did not offer any option except telling us no. ALSO, two sodas were ordered with no ice but she failed to get that done correctly. ""No ice"" was printed on the sticker-label when we picked up our food, however she still put ice in both drinks and they tasted diluted. On the phone she sarcastically responded to me with ""uh huh"" and ""right"" after every sentence I spoke. Her communication skills are lacking and her attitude is most inadequate for a management position as she was a poor representation for Bjs in Arcadia. Her customer service was the worst we have ever experienced at a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=380,2.76,2.79,3.188,2.9800000000000004,2.7779999999999996
194,Christian B.,"Monrovia, CA",28,9,4.0,2.0,2014-05-08,"I've never had bad service from this particular BJ's, but tonight (05/08/14) was different. My friends and I came here with a party of 7 on a Thursday night and it was fairly slow. We were having a simple going away dinner for our friend.  Our first server was a very nice gentleman that was pretty good. He only forgot our utensils and only gave them to us after we asked and after all of our plates were in front of us. No biggie :) About midway through dinner, he tells us that his shift is ending and that another person would be helping us out from there. What he didn't tell us was our service was also going out the door with him! It all went downhill from that point...  We were never offered one refill for any of our empty drinks. We didn't get checked up on. We asked for the dessert menu and the single menu she eventually brought us took long to come out. After 15-20 minutes, the server still didn't show. Eventually our friend that was going away went to the front desk to ask for the manager to come to our table.  She came by and we told her what was going on. She didn't apologize, she didn't offer us anything, and she didn't seem like she wanted to make the situation any better. All she kept saying was ""Ok. Ok. Ok."" We asked for our checks and she only gave us one pen to use among the 7 of us here... Weirdly, the manager only took a couple of our checks at a time and didn't wait for all of us to put together the money for all of our bills. My friend eventually told the manager that he was upset we were forgotten and that no one apologized for what happened to us. She finally said sorry and she said she ""thinks"" we got bad service because she ""thinks"" the girl got too busy... I'm no expert but- oh wait I am- I work in customer service as a manager and that is no excuse. Recognize the spike in business and redirect your employees accordingly. Also, if you were as busy as you said you were, why did we see you casually talking to the host as we're walking out instead of helping your servers? You lying girl.

114,Franklin F.,"Hampton, VA",55,62,56.0,5.0,2014-05-15,"We visited the BJ's of the evening of the 1st round of the NFL draft. It was early evening on the west coast and we were just finishing a job in the area. We walked in the front door and not one of the many TVs in the restaurant were playing the draft. I'm walking to our table with my radio to my ear waiting to hear where the marquee players were picked and who my Ravens were going to select. When we were finally seated, it was in a booth right under a tv. We immediately asked our server if he could switch our tv to the draft. After taking our drink order, he left to get his manager to switch the station. After a few minutes the station changed and the manager peeked her head around the corner and said, ""you all look like you want to see the NFL draft."" We laughed and talked to her a few minutes about football and our favorite teams. Before long our drinks arrived and we ordered our dinner.  I got a small, hand tossed pizza with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni. The food was hot and the flavor was on point. But my main objective that evening besides seeing the draft was to order a pizookie. BJ's has an awesome dessert called the pizookie. It comes in a round mini deep dish pan that I assume is used for personal pan deep dish pizza. The pan has a hot baked cookie in it that I believe they slightly under bake because it is so moist, delicious and not totally firmed up like cookies that have been sitting for a while. On the top of the cookie they throw on a couple scoops of ice cream with a chocolate/caramel drizzle. If you don't do anything but order a pizookie, do it. Hands down one of the best items on the menu.  We loved the hospitality from the staff and the manager coming over to make sure that we were squared away with the draft.

170,Whitney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2786,365,400.0,4.0,2014-09-25,"Was meeting some old friends from my college days at University of Miami.  One guy was here for work from Miami, why else would I be running out to Arcadia from West Hollywood on a Wednesday night.  When he said, 'BJ's' I thought that he meant that low rate wholesale discount shopping place and I kept thinking ""Why are we going shopping for mass quantities of toilet paper together?""   Luckily, he meant this chain restaurant next to his Hampton Inn.  It was the night the Dodgers won the West Coast title so it was packed and loud as hell with cheering sports fans (which I hate) but it's not like I frequent this place, so it's all good. As far as a chain restaurant the food was WAY better than a Ruby Tuesdays, Fridays, or one of those other garbage chain restaurants.  I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was actually really good.  We also shared the avocado eggs rolls and those were disgusting.   I think the other guys liked them, but to me they the mush in the middle of 100% avocado was just not what I wanted after biting into a crispy egg roll skin.  It was like pre-digested baby food in a crispy wonton shell- sounds good right? GROSS!  I don't know why this item is popping up on menus these days- Avocado overload in California?  I don't like it, not one bit, that's all I know.   All in all it was a nice, chill, non-Hollywood night in the Pasadena area, away from all the hustle and bustle.  It was amazing at what ease I had parking in a mega lot right out front, as opposed to having to pay for valet or literally avoid places in Hollywood all together because of the poor parking situation.  What a treat!

73,Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4325,743,1968.0,4.0,2014-10-12,"For many years, Arcadia has tried to build up a downtown area. This has proven somewhat problematic, in the sense that Arcadia is a fairly spread out town.  The business centers of the town tend to string along the 210 freeway to the north and south, with residential areas tipping a few miles below and up towards the foothills. With such a diverse community, it never surprises me that in this so-called downtown area, one can find restaurants with foods from every corner of the planet.  Korean barbecue, sushi restaurants, Chinese bistros, Italian delis, and good old-fashioned American bars... To name a few. Back in the early 90s, this particular restaurant was a Bennigan's. The menu and bar were roughly similar... and like BJ's, it was a popular lunch spot for Arcadia's professional community. One nice thing about BJ's current menu is that it does offer several options in the low calorie but not low on taste department. Of course, I mitigate this potential caloric savings by ordering something blonde cold and bubbly.  That said, this is a casual and laid-back place to have a drink or two with friends, take a second or third date, or just sit at the bar and watch whatever's playing on the giant TV. Service here is always awesome.  They take good care of you, and on your second or third trip, they will remember you.  They used to have a lunch special called the Nooner. The marketing might have changed on it, but you can still get that deal... Plus there's something lowbrow humor enjoyable about asking your server for... Well you get the idea. Parking can be a little tough around the lunch hour, particularly with several restaurants right next door, and office buildings behind.  Best bet is to go in one car with several buddies and enjoy your time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=60,3.48,2.98,3.176,2.7359999999999998,3.18

Before we even ordered, we requested separate checks. The server said he would divvy up the checks at the end. Then he half-assedly took our order, looking bored and not writing down key details. When asked if the gluten free menu was available, he said he didn't know and then stared at us. No offer to check. The food came out 45 minutes later, and they had put cheese on my dad's burger (he's lactose Intolerant). They also took 30 minutes to bring him a new one (the rest of us were halfway done eating). He checked on us maybe once or twice in 2 hours. We ordered dessert and it took an additional 45 minutes. THEN, the waiter brought the bill--the whole very expensive bill--to one person instead of splitting it like he promised. At this point, we were fed up and just wanted to leave, so we just paid it the way it was. The grand finale? We didn't know that gratuity wasn't included (it usually is on large bills) or we would have included it (even though the whole experience sucked). The hostess brought the bill back and rudely informed us, ""Just so you know, trip is not included in this bill"". Wow.

So finally, our server placed another order for a fresh pizza. After waiting for a fresh pizza, they finally brought it out, along with the manager. This is where my issue is. The manager did nothing but smile, point out that the pizza previously ""looked funny"", stood there for a minute while we got served, and then walked away.

Fast forward to this past Monday, and I am impressed! So impressed that I think BJ's is my new favorite casual restaurant! My ""first"" memorable BJ's experience was back in November at the Downey location where I tried the Pork Chile Verde fries and instantly became a BJ's fan. That location is about 3-4 times the size of this Monrovia location, but Monrovia's customer service can't be beat. We came for my sister in law and her fiancé's birthday so we had a party of about 25 with about half in our party being kids 13 and under. What I liked the most about this BJ's experience is that the whole staff worked in a team and took care of all of our needs. One server in particular, I wish I could remember her name really stood out because every time you asked her for something she'd say ""my pleasure"". Well it was my pleasure because we really didn't have to ask for too much. I had the California Burger (half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing) which was awesome, my wife had the shrimp scampi pasta (Flavorful shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and Roma tomatoes. Topped with Parmesan cheese, seasoned bread crumbs and parsley) and my daughter had the Cajun chicken pasta (A creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions.) and they were ALL DELICIOUS. One thing I wanted to mention was that we finally got to try a pizookie, which one of my buddy's from work never stops talking about. We tried a salted caramel one (A little sweet and a little salty. Made with caramel cookie dough, pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Topped with vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce and a Ghirardelli SQUARES® dark chocolate.) and it was off the chain! But what's really awesome is that for every pizookie they sell, they donate money for cystic fibrosis research. What an outstanding way to contribute to the community! Don't forget the dessert guys!

67,Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717.0,3.0,2015-01-18,"I remember years and years ago when this BJ's restaurant opened. It was really busy and quite popular. BJ's had amazing pizookies and incredibly large baked potatoes that could feed you for days.  But gone are the days of those gigantic potatoes and quality of food (well at least for some of their food items)... and now fast forward to today... I have not been back to this location in over 10+ years until just last week. I came twice for two separate to go orders and ordered the following: Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I really enjoyed this salad, but wasn't a fan of the goat cheese and red onions (I only like cooked onions, never raw). But aside from that, the flavors and textures in this salad was excellent. The dried cranberries and grapes gave this salad a nice light sweetness and the candied pecans had a nice added crunch. I also liked the Brussels sprouts were cooked well and not charred like they are at other restaurants.  Shrimp Scampi Pasta, $16.25 prior to tax- This was one heavy cheesy and creamy dish. Definitely not a heart healthy entree, but I did like it. The garlic bread served on top was nice but I could do without it. I was actually surprised with the amount of shrimp you get in this pasta dish and the size of the shrimp. More than expected (most seafood dishes are usually pretty skimpy on the seafood). New Orleans Jambalaya, $16.50 prior to tax- This dish was good, it was quite hearty and filling with the chunks of chicken and sausage. My husband and mother also enjoyed this dish as well since the portion size was plenty for more than one person.  Honey Lime Seared Scallops, $14.50 prior to tax- I liked the scallops in this entree but it did not have a honey lime flavor to me. Scallop naturally taste wonderful so really there is no need to add anything else to it. I wished there were more asparagus in this dish but it was good and the brown rice was made perfectly.  Balsamic Glazed Chicken, $14.50 prior to tax- The chicken was moist and pounded thin. This entree came with 2 thin pieces which is perfect for sharing. The mashed potatoes were buttery and creamy. The crispy fried onion strings were also a nice touch.  Barbecue Bison Burger with Baked Potato as side, $10.25 prior to tax- I really liked this bison burger. It was cooked perfectly. I liked the pico de gallo on the burger and the chipotle barbecue sauce wasn't too spicy for me.   I would have rated this BJ's higher if it wasn't for the customer service. Both of these to go orders were made on line. It is nice that you can pick what time you would like to pick up your order. On my first visit to pick up my order, I was quite disappointed to see my salad just sitting out on the counter instead of being placed in a refrigerator to ensure that my salad is nice and crisp. But aside from that, pick up was easy. But on my second visit, it was on a Wednesday evening and they were pretty busy. Instead of my food being ready at the time quoted on line, It ended up being ready 30 minutes later. Also since I was using a coupon on this order, I had to wait a long time for a manger to come and approve the coupon (only managers can do this and not employees). The manager even was making it a little difficult to use our coupon at first and asked where did I get it... as if he was questioning the validity of my coupon. And people in line before and after me had the same coupon (it was a buy one, get one free entree coupon which I got in my email box because I joined their rewards club sometime back).  So thus, a 3 star rating is rather fair for my last 2 visits.  By the way, this BJ's restaurant is located in the same plaza as The Olive Garden (also across the street from Souplantation). The parking lot does have a lot of parking, but you may not be so lucky to get a spot right in the front if you come on the weekends here. Try finding parking in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=60,2.88,3.05,3.096,2.8600000000000003,2.9819999999999998

Some highly intoxicated person claiming to be the owners son approached my boyfriend got all up in his face with a rude attitude as we were walking in the door. They started exchanging words and you would expect the personnel to step in and handle the situation yet they were just standing there doing absolutely nothing. They ignored the fact of what was going on and ended up giving us a table.  The guy went out came back in started pointing fingers at my boyfriend kept looking at him as if he was going to do something to him. Went into the bar area drank some of his beer and kept looking back at him. A waiter just passed by us shouting don't listen to him he's drunk. Does this place not have regulations???  We ended up leaving. Didn't feel comfortable at all. & most definitely will never return again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=140,2.8,3.04,3.08,2.5320000000000005,2.9440000000000004

I consider myself a foodie I enjoy going to many different kinds of restaurants. So it was no deal yesterday when I decide to meet up with a friend have a couple drinks and dinner. I really wish I would have read these reviews first before coming to this location. I was going to tell you straight up they don't care about your well-being. Never in my life have I have been so sick in the past 24 hours, and I knew something was wrong with my stomach while I was there and I had ordered and Gingerale. The minute I got home I was profusely sick. While on my way to the emergency room I called the manager let him know what was going on for concern for other patrons. At first he seemed to care and he told me he would refund my money and asked me for a receipt. I told him I did not have that and then I was headed to the emergency room, after I got back from the hospital I called him again. That's when everything changed including his story. Basically made me out to be a liar and said that it was not his restaurant at all that made me sick and that he was not going to refund my money nor that he told me he when in fact he did. he also lied about me needing a receipt and said that all he needed was a card number. I hate nothing more than liars- and I don't know what his agenda was but don't lie to me !! like what do you think I'm stupid? like I'm not gonna recollect what you told me?  And to add insult to injury he told me that the company will get back to me when they can about the situation. And he refused to answer me when I asked when can I expect to hear back form them. I'm sorry I don't deserve this - I serve my community and I deserve much better customer service and then get food poisoning and then be treated like this told that it's not their problem night wasn't them and then lied to twice.

The waiter constantly checked up on us and was quick on the refills. But like I mentioned before, I always feel very rushed. He brought to-go boxes without us asking him to, & he brought the bill without us asking for it. I've never worked in a restaurant, so i don't know if that is normal because at any other restaurant, they usually wait until we ask. So how did he know that we weren't gonna order some more food? Or how did he know if I was even done eating?  My friend and I ignored the fact that it looked like we were being rushed out, and we stayed another hour just to finish catching up.

215,Jenny L.,"San Gabriel, CA",76,305,168.0,1.0,2015-03-21,"First thought, CAN I LEAVE ZERO STARS? The service was BEYOND atrocious and this is coming from an EX-regular customer. I have never experienced anything this ridiculous at ANY restaurant. I don't even know where to begin. We walk in at 10:30 AM...30 minutes after they open on a Saturday morning. There are 2 other tables with people at them, they didn't have any food, but oh they probably just ordered. The A/C is blasting and we get seated far away from any of the other tables. Despite freezing, we wait for the waiter and then my mom orders a coffee and we quickly place our orders (now it's around 10:40) for food. Like I said, WE WERE REGULARS so we know the menu pretty well and have never had problems. 10 minutes pass, the coffee finally comes with 3 tiny creamers. My mom asks for more cream, 5-10 minutes pass, then he hands us a small bowl of creamers. Ok cool, no where's our food? It's been 20 minutes since we ordered. The manager comes around and asks if we had ordered...what??! YES. My mom POLITELY tells her ""we've been waiting 20 minutes"" The manager RUDELY says ""What? What have you been waiting for?"" WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OUR FOOD. YOU'RE WELCOME FOR CLARIFYING. She had the WORST attitude, which carried on throughout our experience. Anyways, my mom finishes her first cup of coffee, so naturally she asks for a refill, 5-10 more minutes pass, no coffee. We ask the waiter what is going on with the coffee!? OH, THEY RAN OUT. How do you run out of something so easily made?? Also how do you run out so quickly when we are literally the 3rd table there. Are the other tables filled with big parties? NO.  OK, so NO COFFEE. Let's wait until they BREW MORE. When they finally brew more, they bring the coffee over and the waiter doesn't take ANY of the other empty creamers or the previous empty coffee cup away....OK COOL. At this point, I'm already pissed from waiting for more than 20 minutes for food and even more irritated by the awful attitude we kept getting from the manager, but again, this had never really happened before, so I'll try to be patient and lenient. However, every time we asked about the status of our food, we were met with DISHONEST answers about it just taking ""a few minutes""...oh really? Because ""a few minutes"" ago, we were told our food was ""almost ready.""  Total wait time before we got COMPLETELY FED UP = 50 minutes. I go up to the hostess and tell her, hey I know it's not your fault, but we have been waiting more than 40 minutes at this point for our food and we have somewhere to be at NOON. She was the only helpful person all day. She grabbed the manager and I explain how PISSED OFF we were because we go to this particular BJ's a lot and the service today was ridiculous and I explained literally everything I had just written above and ALL I was met with was her dumb robotic answers, ""Oh. I know. I understand. I'm sorry."" THEN, she had the nerve to ask if we wanted our food to-go, IT WILL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES. Are you kidding me?? WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE THAN ""A FEW MINUTES"" THIS WHOLE TIME...NO. And then she said there was a problem with our order, which would explain ""why other tables got their food before us""...EXCUSE ME? I could've gone to Ralph's, made the exact same thing, in less time than we had been waiting. Our order was NO where near complicated. The most complicated thing I had requested was to include EGG WHITES instead of normal eggs. We had ordered straight from the menu.  Because of all of our WASTED time, I'm now sitting and eating my delicious chipotle while writing this review because we were starving and we needed something way faster to make our next appointment. THIS BJ'S MANAGEMENT IS INCONSIDERATE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant after waiting so long, but there's a first time for everything. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.

313,Jay B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,7,,1.0,2015-04-06,"I witnessed something yesterday that made me so uncomfortable I felt compelled to share with others so I'm posting on both sites involved, even if nothing ever comes of it. I was dining at BJ's with my family for Easter Sunday (which is another reason I didn't say anything at the time) when all of a sudden the police showed up, I'm assuming to escort a group of young adults out as I had noticed a manager was speaking with them a few minutes before. It seemed like a ""0 to 100"" type deal as there wasn't anything inherently wrong with that party. I couldn't help but notice that the 2 guys were black and the ladies were Latina's, meanwhile everyone else was white. From what I could overhear the accusation was that they were loud and unruly. I was sitting within earshot and they were neither too loud nor unruly; They were, however, clearly having a good time and last I checked, that is not a crime at a sports bar. They were literally surrounded by middle aged white folk who chose to sit in the bar area next to them. Honestly, I was ashamed of my own people who judged and muscled them out. The situation became painfully uncomfortable when my children asked why this was happening. I couldn't eat another bite and watched the officers (2 head-shaved white men) and BJ's management basically B.S. and belittle the kids until they left. I hope someone out there reading this is in a position to rectify the situation although I highly doubt it. It was disgusting and disheartening in 2015 in California, I felt transported to the Cotton Belt circa 1960.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=300,3.0,3.16,3.088,2.468,3.0960000000000005
178,Grace W.,"Alhambra, CA",1,32,23.0,2.0,2015-04-07,"This is the second visit to this restaurant and tonight was quite a disappointment. First, we came here to celebrate my boy's 15th birthday. As we were seated, I told the hostess and she assured me that she would mention to our server. But to be safe, I told the server myself and he said he would do something special for him. There were five of us, we ordered five entrees and an appetizer. We wanted to make sure the appetizer has enough for all five of us. We asked how many servings for the Thai Shrimp Lettuce wrap, our server told us 6, but there were only 4, so my husband and I shared one. Minus a star... Out of the five entrees, two were terrible. My husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi Pasta, it was so bland, it was like as if the chef forgot to season it with any salt or flavor. Mine was the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, the chicken was so dry! By far, it was the worse I have ever eaten. The flavor was good but how could you overcooked chicken breast?  I thought I could handle it (it is not like I haven't had dried chicken breast before), but in the end, I have to ask to return it and reorder another dish. So, minus two stars for the quality of food but add back one for the friendliness of the management to make the change without a fuss. The other entrees were pasta and a burger and they were ok but definitely not as good as we remembered from previous visit.

Two managers welcomed us from the host stand and I asked if the bar had open seating (we planned on watching the game while we ate). The manager motioned us to take a seat and his hostess would bring menus and silverware.  All set at our table, we thumbed through our menus and eventually made our decisions for dinner. So we waited for the server to come by as we had seen two different male servers in the bar area talking to tables. Nothing, for 5 minutes or so. One of the servers hustled past us to make conversation and watch the game with another server at a nearby terminal. Nine minutes, still nothing. We even tried to make eye contact with one of the two bartenders but they were helping their own guests and making conversation with servers picking up drinks.  After 12 minutes we decided to take our business elsewhere. I'm a server, my fiancé a kitchen manager with one of BJ's competitors.

Once the drinks arrived she left without asking us if we were ready to order our meal, which we were... in the time it took for her to ask us our order and for the SECOND waiter to bring it to us two parties that had arrived AFTER us not only received their meal but were done with it (their meals consisted of appetizers and a main course).. when we asked our second waiter for our check and pizookies he left and never returned...  25 min later i noticed one of the other waiters was an old high school acquaintance and asked him if he could check on our order and bring the manager over to our table.. (him now being our THIRD waiter) he left and returned with our pizookies and told us they were just finished... we werent so sure since the pizookies didnt seem super hot and the cookies were already hard from cooling down and not gooey...

The actual dinner dishes are just okay. A bit pricier for the same mediocre food. But ordering their pizzas and flat bread pizzas is the way to go here. They have a good variety of tap beers served here. You can go with their pale ales (stronger and more bitter) to the cider beers which is fruity. They basically will have something their to tickle your fancy. Just ask the waiters or waitresses and they'll be able to explain to you  the different kinds of alcoholic beverages to fulfill your cravings. I like their pizzas because it's always freshly made for your order. I particularly like their flat bead pizzas with whichever toppings you like because it's not as heavy compared to the thick crust that's heavy enough with cheese and bread to bloat you. The Buffalo wings are also delicious. You could order regular spicy wings or the non spicy sweet ones to the tangy ones. It's usually served with a dipping sauce along with celery sticks and mini carrots. Other items such as the salads, sandwiches, pastas, can be a hit or miss. Certain times it doesn't seem to be as fresh... but at least it's still okay. Their steaks are good. A couple times a bit dry even when cooked medium... which was probably medium well. But again no complaints since it was enjoyable as it was also flavorful.  The service here... again can be a hit or miss. Sometimes superb, and other times a bit lacking. What it basically boils down to, is how busy they get. On weekends,  this BJ can become packed with people. There could be a decent long wait with nowhere to sit. And can be horrendous if it's really cold and rainy outside. But oh well... I'll give up my seat to an elder and suffer. I like this location since it's convenient.

He was talking to a cashier at the store & another customer over heard that we both got food poisoning from this restaurant & the specific location. The customer that overheard the conversation said that she was a former employee from here & that they would get a lot of calls about food poisoning. It's a restaurant. No matter how careful a restaurant is it is unfortunately bound to happen. But the fact that a former employee said they would receive a lot of complaints is pretty disgusting & scary. I've gotten food poisoning before, but this one feels much different. Almost like something bad is sitting in my stomach & HORRIBLE cramping pain.

They finally get the right pizza to the table and we tell the waiter that was definitely not okay. We get the manager to our table and it just went downhill. Where trying to explain to him what was going on, he started off talking to us  like we were children and then he tries to make a joke about it. I stopped him and told him it was definitely not a joke, one mistake is okay but bringing 2 wrong pizzas to our table was not okay and he asked well did you get the right one this time?.

Thankyou BJ university for training your chefs to be consistent with flavor taste and presentation. Now the wait staff/bar keeps need to keep an eye out for the consistency of the head on the beers from tap. We had visited with in a few weeks several times and ordered same beers and the heads were consistent till this latest time. Big foam head for our red buffalo :( fail. The head on the beer is tasty and flavorful but it's a bit much and we like the drink not air flavored beer. Please don't deliver beers that have huge heads or no heads, just about a half inch is good, not 1 1/2"" one that's a bit much.

I've tried their BBQ chicken & Sweet Pig (Ham, Pineapple) deep dish pizzas. The Sweet Pig is a Hawaiian pizza so you'll like it if you're a pineapple fan (like me). The BBQ chicken pizza is a classic & it's not too heavy on the BBQ sauce which I liked. You can still taste the BBQ sauce though! Both are great choices I recommend. It's more on the heavy side but the thick bread like crust is what makes it GOOOOD. Save your carbs for the deep dish pizza. It'll be worth it!!  I also tried the chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken is more on the greasy and saucy side. It comes with two sauces. A sweet ginger asian one & a mustard that tastes like.. wasabi? My boyfriend liked it though! I can't stand wasabi so I stuck with the sweet ginger sauce. We also ordered the Santa Fe salad with chicken. It was very heavy on the dressing so eventually it made the crisp romaine leaves kinda soggy :( Comes with corn, cheese, wonton strips, chicken, red onions, avocado. It was good though and they added this red condiment on top which gave it a nice kick of flavor. Maybe it was paprika? Idk but it was bomb.  MONDAYS: half off an large deep dish pizza!!

143,Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10.0,2.0,2016-11-16,"We chose to host a birthday gathering at this BJ's.  First, we called to make a reservation and was told that they don't take them.  But then, when we arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before the time we told our guests, we were asked if we had a reservation.  What???  They told us it would be a 10 minute wait.  After 20 minutes, we asked when we would be seated and we were told that we wouldn't be seated until our entire group was there.  Our entire group had been there almost the entire time.  We were seated in a large booth in the back corner of the bar (we had three minors with us).  As the hosts, we asked for a different table, as this table was embarrassing.  There was a huge tv in the booth, a speaker right over the table, and the door to the kitchen right there.  This was NOT an appropriate table for a child's birthday party!  We were told that this was the only table available.  Looking around the restaurant, at 5:00 PM, there were several tables open, especially in the side room.  When we asked about those tables, we were told that they were reserved.  We explained that we HAD called for a reservation and was told that they didn't take reservations.  The hostess stated that this was the only table available and if we didn't like it, the wait would be another hour.  Clearly she was full of &*#$ - again, half the restaurant was empty.  To avoid a scene we joined our guests in the crappy corner booth.  The speaker was so loud that we were all having to yell at one another.  The server couldn't even hear us (which likely explains why almost all of our orders were WRONG).  Through the course of the evening we asked the server THREE times to turn the speaker down.  We also asked the busboy once and the food delivery person once.  When we asked for a manager, we were told one wasn't available.  On to the food.......When the soups and salads arrived we didn't have any silverware.  We asked the food runner - none.  We asked the server - none.  We asked a bus person - none.  We asked our server again - he dumped a handful of silverware in the middle of the table.  By now, according to our guest who had soup, the soup was barely warm.  Finally, a woman, don't know who she was, brought us proper settings wrapped in napkins.  When our dinners arrived, as previously mentioned, most of them were wrong.  We tried asking the server to have things corrected, but it just started going from bad to worse.  For example, we sent one plate back for a correction, only to have an entirely different meal returned.  Had to send it back and wait for the right order to be sent out.  Also, it is extremely irresponsible for a restaurant to put a scalding hot plate in front of a young child - especially without saying anything. Fortunately, the adult sitting next to the young child touched the plate before the young child did, so she was able to move the food to a cool plate.  Overall, it was it was an extremely horrible evening, and as hosts, embarrassing.  This wasn't the first time we had hosted a large group at BJ's, but it was definitely the last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=140,2.96,2.86,2.952,2.7280000000000006,2.9

The waitress was kind enough to tell me we could upgrade the pizza to a large for only $3. She made my night. We had the BJ Favorite and it was wonderful. We all had side salads (can choose from house, wedge, Caesar, or tomato and mozzarella) that were great and we got pizookies for dessert. If you have never tried one, boy are you missing out!

28,Florencio B.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",10,5,,1.0,2017-06-08,"This BJ's location has been in steep decline for years. Today I placed an online order for curbside pickup. My order was placed at 10:15 PM and scheduled to be ready at 10:30 PM. I drove to the location, arriving a few minutes after 10:30 PM, parked in the curbside pickup stall, and called the restaurant informing them that I had arrived for my order. The first employee I spoke to complained that the restaurant was too loud and she could not hear me, after yelling my name into my phone for the third time, she got it (wrong, but close enough to confirm my order). She stated she would let someone know that I had arrived for my  order. So I waited...and waited...and waited. 20 minutes went by and no one had come out to my car with my oder. I called the restaurant a second time, and a different employee answered the call. I told her I had been waiting for 20 minutes for my order to be brought out to me, and no one had showed up. She then says, ""We don't provide curbside pickup after 9:30 PM, it's company policy."" I politely informed her that at no point during the order process was I told that curbside pickup was not available after a certain time, nor were there any notices in the pickup stalls, and the previous employee made no mention of it when she said someone would be out with my order. She then proceeds to tell me that I must come in to the restaurant to pick up my order. I must've not mentioned that I have a knee injury that makes it painful to walk, hence why I ordered curbside. She said the only way to get my food was to come inside the restaurant. I told her I would not be doing that, and I cancelled my order. I could hear her become indignant as I was hanging up and driving away. This is terrible customer service. Never mind if a disabled person orders curbside because they cannot make it inside, BJ's is refusing to accommodate a customer who now may potentially have a legitimate ADA complaint on their hands.

It wasn't until her manager walked up and said hello to me that she finally acknowledged my presence. With no sense of urgency or concern for her lack of observation she just said ""Oh, hi... how many?"" If it wasn't for the $3 pizookie they would've lost 3 customers.   I gave a 3 because I loooove pizookies!!!! And they were cooked perfectly. The margaritas were strong  and the pizza was delicious. If I had to grade based on my waitress and the host it'd be 1 stars. The deduction is because of those things. My waitress was wired a little loosely and the host was negligent.  It could've been a 5 guys. Let's do better!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia,2.92,2.96,3.0,,2.944

And then while paying, my friends and I did cash then card. My waitress specifically asked if we wanted to do cash then card and I said yes but they went ahead and charged it all in my card and took the cash as tip. I signed without realizing so I'm not going to put all the blame on them but I'm a bit pissed off. This location specifically gave me bad vibes and I felt I wasn't treated very great.

36,Becky H.,"Phoenix, AZ",51,1,,1.0,2017-10-15,"I understand this is a sports bar, but they have a full menu including breakfast. A basic knowledge of how to cook eggs for breakfast menus, should be a a given. Not here! First, I specifically asked if their ham was a ham steak type, he said not a steak but its pretty thick piece. NOPE!! He comes out with deli style, thin sliced & apologizing that they just changed the type of ham. I ask for bacon instead. Then I look at my eggs. I asked for over easy. They are over medium with semi hard yoke. He takes it back, he comes back with the eggs cooked even HARDER! JEEZ!!! Over easy, I explain, soft yoke, soft whites. Waiter even sez we shouldnt serve breakfast if they can't cook eggs. They go back to the kitchen. Gawd I hope they are right! Yay! They came out right, but by this time the other foods, toast, potatoes & bacon are cold. Ughh. Someone else comes over & apologizes for the eggs, but no mention of a discount or other  type of ""comp"". Really, only an apology? An explanation for this was that the cooks egg pan was cracked & he didn't realize it until we brought back the eggs. 2nd time, it was mwntioned???!!!???

78,Jillian H.,"Arcadia, CA",155,2,,1.0,2017-11-11,"I came here around 10:30 with some of my coworkers on a Friday night. I will admit that we can sometimes get loud and that can be seen as obnoxious, but we all work in a restaurant so we go out of our way to be good guests when we dine in other restaurants. Firstly, we placed our order and waited for 45 minutes, and someone in our party had to leave before the food even came out. This person has just ordered a mini pizookie, so we requested that they just package it to-go so he could still get home as soon as possible. They brought out a broken, mashed  up cookie that looked like someone had chewed it up and spit it back out. We sent it back and he had to ask for a refund and leave without even getting to eat anything. Throughout our entire visit, our waitress, Nicole, was incredibly sassy and short tempered with us. She provided the bare minimum in regards to basic customer service. Once again, all of us work in a restaurant and are fully aware of the struggles of working as a server, but we also know that there are supposed to be standards for customer service. I am VERY dissatisfied with our experience and honestly, I don't think we will be coming back.

21,Xariklia G.,"Alhambra, CA",42,19,6.0,2.0,2017-12-04,Annoyed with the take out tonight. The point of ordering ahead is so I did not have to come in. Here I am inside because apparently the kitchen ran out of the soup I wanted and the associate didn't think it was a good idea to come out and let me know. He came out so quick to take my payment and then disappeared on me. When I went in he just kept repeating the fact that the kitchen ran out! I would have been ok waiting if he would be let me know!

My girlfriends and I celebrated my engagement here. I was just here a few months ago celebrating my sister's birthday. The food has always been consistent and I don't remember service being bad. So when my husband got a BJs gift card for his birthday we thought, ""Awesome. We'll definitely use this."" So a couple nights ago we ordered takeout via the app. It should have been very simple. Our orders weren't complicated: two burgers and fries to go. But when my husband tried to pick up our food the hostess asked him to wait for the manager. When the manager showed up he then accused my husband of trying to pay with a ""fraudulent gift card."" All of this before even looking at the gift card or trying to run the gift card. They saw a black man with a gift card and assumed it was fraud. When they finally ""tried it"" it worked as gift cards usually do.

We ordered the sirloin steak medium rare; which came out well done but we didn't have time to wait to take it back. Kinda disappointed. Also got the cherry chipotle salmon. It was tasty, however the asparagus was burnt. We ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and honestly that was the most disappointing. They were dry, crusty, burnt, and tasted really really old. Over all the food was alright. I could have made a better steak and salmon at home that's for sure. Our server was nice enough to give us 10.00 off our bill.

2,Theodore M.,"Chicago, IL",23,17,9.0,3.0,2017-12-18,"The seating and sit-down meal areas brought a lot of families with children weekend nights while the sports bar area was good for groups of two to six people. As a sports bar it's about average. There is one giant screen that shows one or four games (the screen can split to quads) depending. There is happy hour during the ball games with solid drink prices and half-price mini-deep-dish pizzas (the mini's were more topped bread balls than actual deep dish but were certainly cheap). For apps the stuffed mushrooms were great and the calamari was good, and for a meal the prime rib was underwhelming (think veins, fat, meh). Went there with a friend two nights in a row and three of the four bartenders offered very good service (I'm bad with names but they were: man short-brown hair 40's slight frame, woman blonde bob multiple rings, and woman maroon hair with tattoos).  Overall, the place wasn't bad and it wasn't good.

46,AP H.,"Temple City, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-21,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent take-out order at Arcadia BJ's for three reasons. First of all, the order was not ready when I showed up 10 minutes after the estimated ready time.  This is not the first time that the order was late and I intentionally showed up 10 min later.  But it was not ready. Secondly, I had to unfortunately wait even longer because the host had to get an approval from the manager for the ""Monday half off pizza"" offer. This promotion has been running on and off for a while and ALWAYS the host/hostess would try to charge me the full price unless I mentioned the offer.  Then they would get manager's approval.  As a customer I feel that BJ's does not really want to offer this promotion and instead trying to get away with it when possible. Thirdly, I ordered a half & half specialty pizza with BBQ chicken and BJ's favorite.  The BBQ chicken side was fine but the other half has only cheese and tomato, NO housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives or white onions.  So we actually only got half a pizza! Wow, what an disappointment! I have sent a message to the manager and got no response yet.I see in the news that it has been tough for BJ's and other chains in terms of business and this is not helping at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia?start=40,2.44,2.93,2.968,,2.734

1,Manny P.,"Bradbury, CA",21,41,1.0,2.0,2018-01-05,"Hey guys, I just wanted to give a quick review the Bj's in Arcadia. I went the today because I had gotten a gift card but normally I would never go there because of the crowd and noise level. I went there today with my mom because of their mini pizza and salad. To our surprise they have expanded their lunch menu. Our waitress went and asked us what we wanted to drink, we asked for and iced tea and a hot tea plus two waters. After looking through the menu I decided to go with the Meat Lover's Piadina. For a $1 more I get an endless refill in ice tea (Which is typical at any sit down joint.) and end bottomless fries. Like Island's but I know these places will not ask you if you want a refill on fries. What I wanted to know is the server is honest enough to switch me over to the $1 make it meal option. Instead of charging me $2.50 for just the drink. With my Piadina my mom ordered the turkey burger. After we received our order both looked good. The turkey burger was ground turkey and very juicy. If it would have smoked ham or applewood smoked bacon on top it would have been perfect. The Meat Lover's Piadina was like a meat pizza wrapped in a crispy thin crust tortilla with crispy fries on the side. Both were very good, but I didn't get any extra fries. Now to the bill. I was charged the $2.50 for the ice tea so she didn't give me the $1 ""Make it a meal"" price. Uncool. I always like to check the integrity factor of a chain establishment and these guys failed. Yes I give a big mark down for that.  I was going to give a 1 star rating but since the food was good I gave it 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arcadia,2.2,2.94,2.948,,2.644
