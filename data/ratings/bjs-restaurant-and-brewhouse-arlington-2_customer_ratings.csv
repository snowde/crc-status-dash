132,Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2456,3000.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"Wait, wait, read it first don't just jump to conclusions. I know, I know.. but Jacob it's a chain!  Thirteen states nationwide have locations of this cookie cutter, chain establishment but there's no denying, it's rockstar for cookie cutter. Walking in the other night, one would never know that there is a shite economy going on presently.  TV's showing sports, people smiling and conversing with one another, brews pouring and tables filled with food and cheer.  By the way, it was about an hour to close and we were able to get a seat right away.  Not the always.  This area is a widely popular go-to for shopping and eating.  The typical busy days and hours of the week should be avoided.  Calling ahead is only good for carryout. Take a quick gander at their menu online, though pricing is not included,  much of it is affordable whether your taking out the kids or having a date night.  They offer this crazy weeknight special (I think for the holidays only) where two, get salads, a specialty medium pizza and dessert for under twenty dollars before tax.  That's insane since many of their medium or large pizzas at regular price are about that price.  You can opt to tack on an additional charge to get two movie tickets at a discounted rate.  That's a bangin' deal!   Recently they introduced small plates.  Think about their regular appetizers but in a smaller portion for a more affordable price.  Try some at $2.95, not bad. BJ's boasts having deep dish pizza and having displayed that on their website I'm surprised they don't have (even) one location in Illinois.  As a Chicagoan that often eats his pizzas deep, I found it not to be the same thing.  If you like dough; say a fan of bread you'd love their deep dish.  It's like a double dough pizza.  My only advice is to inquire with your waiter / waitress whether they would add an ample amount of sauce or just go for it and ask for extra.  My first time our pizza suffered from not having enough pizza sauce.  It was dry and by the time we got a side of warm sauce, it just didn't matter. Good times had with a great bro and made awesome with stellar service.  The prices were right and I think if I happened on another location, I'd try it again. Note to the wise.  If hitting on a girl and wanting to grab a drink with her.  You may not like to start the sentence saying, ""So, I'm a fan of BJ's and was thinking we could.."" instead you may like to say "" So, I'm a fan of BJ's brewhouse and was thinking..""   Double entendre can be fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arlington-2?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.056,3.3200000000000003

206,Selena B.,"Arlington, TX",0,6,1.0,1.0,2012-12-12,"HORRIBLE Experience, Thoughtless and Inconsiderate Manager. Arlington Texas location 455. Was there for dinner with my family a party of 5. We thought we ordered a hand tossed large pizza but mistakenly the classic which is usually a hand tossed else where is actually a deep dish at this restaurant. We eat here about once a month but had never ordered pizza, we have a couple of favorites that we usually stick to but for tonight we felt like trying something different. Well it took about 40 minutes for our main course and we were hungry from Christmas shopping so we dug right in and we didn't know the difference until the bill came. It was only a $4 difference but when speaking with manager Jennifer Crenea she told use that since we ate the pizza we had to pay the higher price. Our bill was $111.94 and I was only asking for an adjustment of $4 because the waiter did not inform us that classic meant deep dish which is not the case at any other restaurant. Then she went on further to say, ""I don't know what to tell you"" when I tried to explain that she was risking the loss of 5 monthly customers who spend over $100 each visit over a $4 issue. She didn't care. Well my family and I will most likely never return. And this mgr couldn't care less about the lost in profits from our family nor did she care about me sharing my experience with my PTA, Dance, Cheer, Choir, Mathaletes, or Girl Scout troop moms whom have all met for late lunches and meetings here.

The food was a mixed bag for me.  The appetizers, bruschetta and a watermelon and feta salad, were good, though the bruschetta was not really bruschetta...I don't understand the urge to add melted cheese to this dish!  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad for lunch, and while the clam chowder was excellent, the salad was pretty blah, and contained a lot of stems.  Also, while I specifically requested the ""unlimited"" option, which was actually a dollar cheaper than the soup and salad lunch, at no point was I offered another portion of either soup or salad (and I wouldn't have turned down another chowder).

Greeted by friendly faces and surprisingly not a long wait.  Roasted French dip was yummy with sweet onion and melted provolone cheese.  I always enjoy the handcrafted beer selection at this restaurant. Went out of my comfort zone and ordered a Piranha Pale Ale. A little more hops then I prefer but a delicious ale. Will stick with my ole stand by Harvest Hefewizen next time.  We decided to order dessert.  Best advice- order the dessert while you are eating.

Each time we come here, he swears to never come back because he is always disappointed by the food. I personally don't think it's too bad, but many things on the menu don't present a wow factor and are available at other restaurants for a cheaper price. I haven't tried too many items from the menu, but I have tried enough. The best thing to order is probably the pizza from here since it's a difficult item to screw up. Food takes at least 30 minutes to get out of the kitchen and onto your table; this includes ordering something simple, like pizza. I don't recommend coming here unless you have an excessive amount of patience. Oh, and don't come here if you have an entire party of guests. My friend recently had a birthday get-together at BJ's and we waited over an hour to be seated. She had made reservations prior to the occasion, but the hostess refused to let us sit in our reserved seats because ""at least half of our party of 20 needed to be present"". Great, more waiting.

Nice since we weren't is the best of moods since we lost and were hungry.  I had the fish and chips with wedge fries. It was huge with four pretty big pieces of fish. Only problem is that there wasn't that much taste and had to use the tartar sauce. My wife and daughter split a huge plate of spaghetti with meat sauce. They enjoyed the spaghetti. My son had the fettichini with chicken. Very bland.  The service was great. Served us quickly and she always made sure we were taken care of.  Just not a fan of the quality of the food.

We were seated quickly, our waiter had the personality of a piece of cardboard though; he did his job, got our drinks and orders, but that's it, nothing more-nothing less. Although I saw him being really friendly with other tables?  My pizza was a bit soggy in the middle(gross) not sure what happened there, maybe it wasn't cooked all the way? Too many toppings? Grease? Whatever, I'm not big on complaining, it could be worse, I could box it up, recook it in the oven and make it crispy.  Not even 10 minutes into our meal the waiter comes to ask if we need to go boxes, we weren't even done eating? Felt a little rushed, especially when he brought out the check with the boxes. That kinda sucked because this was my birthday dinner, I wanted to have a nice meal with my family but I felt as soon as I got the meal part, he was trying to get us to leave. I didn't even get to try any of the beers, he snatched the menu away after we ordered our food.  I wish I could give this place 5 stars, it seemed to have a nice atmosphere. It wasn't a terrible experience, but it definitely could have been better. The pizza was good, well... the cooked part anyway, and nobody else complained about their food.

Hubby ordered the Ahi Poke, which is chopped sashimi grade ahi tuna, mixed with onions and some kind of sauce.  Served with crispy won ton triangles that were great!

The food is fine, the drinks are cold, and maybe the kitchen might be a bit slow at some times. My review focuses on 1 particular person at the bar. She always checks her phone when she can, slow to asking how are you or if you need anything else, and you'll need to get her attention with a loud audible tone.

Our waiter was training and he seemed a little bit clueless about the menu, but he was really nice and attentive, so all was well.  We each had a berry cider (BJ's own), which are always bright and bubbly and good (about $5 each). Then we decided to share the roasted kale and Brussel sprout salad ($10) as well as a gluten free pizza with roasted garlic and pepperoni ($10 small pizza + $1 per topping). For a restaurant that seems to serve absolutely every genre of food ever, I think BJ's actually makes a really great GF pizza. It's small, but the crust is nice and toasty and the toppings are fairly generous. The salad was also really delicious! All of the ingredients went great together; kale, goat cheese, dried cranberries, candied pecans, apples, and Brussel sprouts (although they were a bit tough). For dessert, my brother convinced me to share the GF chocolate chip pizzookie with him, which was good but way too sweet for my taste. It's like a giant, undercooked, doughy, hot and melty cookie with cold vanilla ice cream on top. Really delicious GF dessert (at least for the first few bites for me). So sweet and filling!

142,Deanna M.,"Arlington, TX",0,10,,2.0,2015-03-31,"How about 2.5 stars, certainly not the A-OK 3 stars. Parking there is awful. Visited on Sat. 3/28, 6pm, party of 6 (including an 11 and 6 y/o).  Seated at 6:40 or so.  Ordered 2 waters, 3 sodas, 1 tea, when delivered we asked how many potato skins per appetizer, waiter wasn't sure, maybe 6 or 8; so we ordered 2 orders.  Came out with 10 per order which ended up being too much.  They Do Not skimp on their potato skins!  Each skin was probably palm sized and thick, they were very very good and served super hot. One adult ordered a rack of ribs and gave 4 ribs to the youngest child; ended up being too spicy for the kid so we scraped off the sauce and rub (I like spice and thought it was overkill for ribs), the meat was pretty dry too :(  , the nice sized baked potato was served with nice portions (we thought) of sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon, and some butter (I don't think anything was an extra charge if you can believe that, a lot of places seem to charge extra for some of those items), it looked really good. Two flat pizzas were enjoyed by 2 adults. I couldn't decide what to order off such an extensive menu, so I decided to be bad (fried food) and order the chicken fried chicken.  I was surprised my dish was served in a shallow Bowl of all things, mashed taters (which were very tasty) piled in the center, corn/pepper mix was surrounding (and under-not cool) the mashed and two pieces of tender chicken (one half breast pounded and split) stacked on top of and off center on potatoes resting on bowls edge-weird to me, but hey goin' with the flow.  What I did Not Like was the gravy (tasty too, certainly not a mix) poured all over the top of the potatoes And corn, and partially on each chicken piece.  This kinda ruined it for me; first off I hate my food being stacked (as this isn't gourmet dining, soooo...) if I want my flavors combined I'll do it myself.  To have that yummy gravy all over the buttery corn was a big mistake. .  IF I ever order this again, I'll definitely ask for the gravy on the side, and hopefully my potatoes will not be sitting on top of a good portion of the corn. The waters and the tea were never refilled nor was it offered, one of the kids saw the waiter pass behind our table and asked for more sierra mist soda, when that was delivered one adult asked for water b/c her soda had been empty for a while. I myself was engrossed in conversation so I failed to be quick enough to ask for more water, dang it. I believe that is the only time the waiter came to the table after the dinners were served.  We all shared a small birthday desert, a Pizookie and dang was it taaaa-sty!  I thought it was a choc. chip type cookie with toffee chips too and caramel on top of it and the ice cream scoop, but I don't see anything that resembles that on their online menu.  Whatever, it was very very good.     Our waiter was a pleasant guy, didn't hound us, but at the same time not refilling our drinks was poor.  Lol, when he came to pick up the bill he did ask us if we wanted anything else to drink. You think that would've been offered as we ordered desert, or even during our meal! Yes, we lingered at the table, the bill was close to 115.00 and he was tipped very well.

One time they said it would be two hours, I looked inside and half of the restaurant was empty. Luckily for me, when I went there this time there was no wait. We ordered the chicken flatbread and a kids Mac and cheese. We had a little issue thing to order the Mac and cheese, the waiter was like I don't know if we can do that, but I'll have to ask (keep in mind I'm an adult, but I didn't want to eat anything else on them menu and I wasn't that hungry so I thought it would be fine). I'm thinking to myself, why can I order the stupid Mac and cheese!? Why would she even need to ask her manager?! Our food came out later, the flatbread tasted really good. It had chicken, avocado, some tomato, cheese and a garlic aioli sauce. My Mac and cheese tasted like a poor attempt of making Kraft Mac and cheese. It looked like it was taken out of a microwaveable tray and put on a plate but whatever, maybe kids love it.

It tasted like they scooped this soup out of the Dead Sea. No one was able to finish it. But the Sourdough bread bowl it was in was amazing, it was a shame that the soup inside was not. The artichoke dip was also very lacking, it tasted very store-bought. My salad was pretty ok, kinda hard to mess that up.  Service: Alright this was a kicker, so I call earlier in the day and ask if BJ's takes reservations. I get told they don't accept reservations for dinner times after 6 or 7pm (I forget) and was then put on the phone with the manager to see what they could do about it.The manager said they could ""put my name down"" to keep us in mind. WHAT? If yall can't take reservations just tell me ""No""! I'm an adult who can handle rejection, just tell it to me straight. So I give them my name to see what might happen later. Later my family and I arrive to BJ's. There was a confusion about why my name was given and that they'd do the best they can to accommodate us. 30-35 minutes later, we get taken to our table.

47,Al U.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,5,,1.0,2016-08-08,Went to BJs tonight The waitress was awesome  I have a credit card that looks a little rough but when entered manually goes through just perfect  I gave it to the waitress and let her know it wouldn't swipe and needs to be entered manually. I have used this credit card dozens of times with no problems. I work retail and am currently a retail manager for 17 years  The manager comes over to our table and refuses the card. I asked why and he said he couldn't take it. If he entered it manually he would loose points. Wow--- loose points was the only reason. In the customer service business credit cards are ran manually for numerous reasons.  Loosing points is not one of them So sad. Lucky I had another credit card and did not push the issue.

32,Dani M.,"Dallas, TX",183,25,583.0,2.0,2016-12-28,"Went as part of a birthday dinner for a family member and while our waiter, Tyler, was great, it was very clear that they were understaffed and no one really seemed concerned about it, least of all the manager. The wait to get our table took awhile, but that was understandable because there were quite a few big parties also there at the same time.  Drinks took a long time to finally get, even just water and soft drinks. Our alcoholic beverages took even longer. One never even got delivered (a bottle of Corona) and two Margaritas had to be sent back because they weren't made properly. Since it was taking so long, they were taken back to the bar directly by us and the person that was actually behind the bar was rude and seemed to be insulted that we didn't like the drinks. Though we finally got the Corona at least. The food took an incredibly long time to finally get. Some of the food was cold by the time we got it. But we were all hungry so we ate anyway We had to request the manager 3 separate times (one time before we even got our drinks, in this case the water and cokes. Once after we finally received our appetizers but before we'd gotten our drinks, and the third time was before we ended up taking the drinks back to the bar ourselves) during our visit before he finally stopped by our table. When he got there he didn't seem very concerned when we were explaining our concerns nor he did he even so much as apologize for all the waiting. He basically just kept insinuating that none of it was his fault because he was called in to cover someone else and he personally hadn't made the schedule so it wasn't his problem. He comped the margaritas, only after he was told we weren't going to pay for something we didn't even drink. He didn't apologize for the service or being understaffed, he didn't apologize for the long waits, he didn't even offer to take a couple percent off for such a long wait. We got seated around 7 and didn't get our food until closer to 9.  All-in-all, I probably won't be making plans to visit BJ's anytime soon.

I will still say the food is pretty good, but service was pretty atrocious, hence the 2 stars.  I don't give a lot of bad reviews, but the service was that bad that I think it deserves it. We essentially felt ignored majority of the time. Waiter seemed a bit on the rude side too initially. When I asked for a certain hot tea he was quick to say that the only thing they had was regular tea. Then he checked his thing and realized they had it. He thought they had run out since they didn't order any previous week..... but I thought it wasn't right for him to say it was out straight up right away. Already put me at edge with the guy. There was a large group he was taking care of as well, so I understand he was busy, but he never checked on us, never stopped by real quick to see if there was anything, never asked someone else to check on us, and didn't even look at us. We were legit ignored for a straight 30 min. By the time our food came out, it was either room temperature or cold. A different server brought it out for us, and by the time she came back with more hot water for my hot tea, we asked her if our food could be reheated. That's when I believe the manager came to us and started taking care of us too. When our food finally came out it was hot enough for us and we were pleased with the food. Had the Thin crust classic pizza, as well as a club chicken sandwich and a bowl of the clam chowder. I have nothing to complain about with the taste of the food but wasn't happy when it initially came out (obviously). We also had room for a mini monkey bread pizooki which I really liked. The atmosphere is great at BJs too. A lot of TVs, my friend wanted to watch a basketball game with some beer and BJs is a great place for that. Lots of drink options! Prices are maybe a tad bit over fair but had we had good service I would've been content with the price. The thing that disturbed me the most is that when we got the ticket, they had taken off the price for the meals and said ""guest recognition"" but then the meals were charged a 2nd time anyways. I'm not saying I expected a free meal at all, but why did you bother putting that in my receipt in the first place just to charge it again and make it he same price it would've been?? It seemed a bit RUDE to have that. I may sound a bit on the prissy side but seriously, why bother with it anyways? We did however get our mini pizookie for free. I do appreciate that.

This was only a problem because we saw multiple servers walk by helping out people around us, but skipping us every time. We weren't that hungry so we just got an appetizer and a dessert. Cheese sticks, which tasted as they should, and a Pizookie, which ended up being thinner than what is seen in the picture. My girlfriend wanted something sweet so we mostly came for the Pizookie, which had a bowel that was deceiving to make it look like there was more than there actually was.

My husband and I went for dinner Friday evening.  First, the hostess sat us in the bar without even asking if we were ok with sitting in the bar area. Then, when our order arrived, my husband did not receive what he ordered. When my husband informed the waiter that he didn't order the California Club flatbread, the waiter said ""you did order the California club flatbread"" I wish I could remember the server's name so I could warn everyone. That was so rude that he actually started to argue with a customer as to what they ordered. What kind of customer service is that???? He also mumbled and barely spoke to where you could understand what he was saying.  Also, the mozzarella sticks were supposed to have been a happy hour special for $6. We were charged the full $8.95. At that point, my husband was too frustrated to even say anything. I'm sure the server would have probably been rude about that too.

Her attitude is bad and her customer service is terrible.  I place a to-go order and asked for no lettuce. When my order came out it had lettuce; so, naturally I informed her of this. She rolled her eyes and then went to the back for about 3-4 minutes and came back with my sandwich. I asked her if they had just removed the lettuce and her reply was (with an attitude), ""there was no lettuce, it was just a little piece that was stuck on the sandwich!""  Excuse, but there was lettuce and you just admitted to such.  I asked her if her name was on the receipt and she replied it was so I asked for my copy. She then tells me I don't have your copy, again with an attitude. I inform her that I gave the gentleman that I paid with both copies of the receipt. She then goes, ""well, maybe he has the copy because I don't!"" She again travels to the back. However, this time I hear her talking to people in back about how it was just a little bit of lettuce on the sandwich and that she doesn't know what it was a problem or why I was acting like a ""bitch""  Are you serious? Is this the kind of service that anyone would deem appropriate? You got my order WRONG!

They didn't want to seat us until 90% of the party was there. Understandable. We get settled into our seats. They arranged the table for 7 people on each side. We were sitting really close to each other. The waitress was prompt on getting our first round of drinks. It took a while for her to take our food order.  The restaurant was probably about 85 degrees inside.  We were all fanning ourselves and pulling our hair up.  The food starts coming out for half the group. About 10 minutes later the food for the other half of the table comes out.  By this time I'm literally sweating and ask for a to go box. It was too warm in there for me to enjoy my meal. 2 people had undercooked hamburgers. The waitress went and had one of them remade.  It was obvious the waitress needed help since she was unable to come by to refill drinks.  The manager acted like he was going to get our refills but our waitress returned with drinks.

Hostess was on her phone facing other side and didn't notice us until we said hi. She sat us at a smaller booth but we ask if we could have a bigger one so that we could sit together but she didn't say anything, just started walking and put the menus on the table on the other side of the restaurant then walked away. We thought that was a bit strange because how could you be all grumpy when you're the hostess of a restaurant. We didn't care much but just thought that they should have a smile on when working in restaurant industry because that's what matters most. Another thing that puts us off was that before they bring out our food they gave us two plates to share, it was all wet and dirty we completely lost our appetite, despite the fact that we were very hungry.

After being shut our previous dining attempt for the evening closed early, we made our way to BJ's. There was a wait so rather than crowd into the lobby, I hit the bar. They had a few of their own brews on draft, in addition to some craft brews that are pretty common to find throughout the US. I opted to try their season Grand Cru. It was pretty standard as far as Belgian Strong Ale's go.  It was really hard to connect with the bartender to settle up and get a glass of water once the table was ready.  Having already eaten a large snack, I was opted to just go with the tomato basil soup. It was salty but better than a canned Campbell's. I used a friend's roll to dip into my soup since it's didn't come with bread. There was nothing wrong with anyone else's meals, they just weren't overly exciting.  Our server was friendly and pleasant, but wasn't the quickest during any step of the way. Aside from the service, there wasn't anything wrong with our experience, it just wasn't exciting, special or worth a return trip by any means.

He came and was nice offered to pay for my steak and replace it I said I didn't was another one bc they reheated mine again so it was fine, he also gave our party free dessert. Therefore I rated a 4 star the kitchen needs to ensure food is cooked properly. The manager was very respectful and accommodating. I will come back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-arlington-2,3.92,3.4,3.4,,3.608
