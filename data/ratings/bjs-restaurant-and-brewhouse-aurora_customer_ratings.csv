159,Tyler S.,"Denver, CO",192,257,113.0,4.0,2012-01-03,"Located by the Aurora mall on the east side of town, BJs brewhouse is where it's at. I recently took my pops here for lunch yesterday and I'm glad I did. BJ's has quite an expansive menu. Ranging from some of the most delicious pizzas I have eaten to their sandwiches, salads, and pasta. I am always impressed with the size of their menu and the array of foods geared towards pleasing everyone in your group. I usually order a pizza every time I come to BJ's - half buffalo chicken and half great white. The buffalo chicken side is always fantastic! They add freshly chopped red onions, chives and white chicken to the buffalo style sauce and then drizzle it with fresh house-made ranch (not the most healthiest, but it is sure tasty). The great white side is an alfredo based-sauce (again not the most healthy I know), with chicken, fresh garlic, and a bruchetta-style tomato. The crust is the best part - it is served deep dish and is thick and moist and delicious! Yesterday, however, I ordered their all you can eat soup and salad combo - and so did my dad. For the salad, went with a boring caesar salad light on dressing and for the soup I went with the chicken tortilla. The salad was pretty ordinary, nothing super special about it, but the soup was incredible! It came in a separate container that our waitress poured into our bowl around some crunchy tortilla strips, tomatoes, and freshly chopped avocado. The avocado in the soup was a nice touch! All-in-all, BJ's Brewhouse is a great place to check out (especially if you have some picky eaters in your crowd and you want to please everyone). Their beers are also great - I didn't order any yesterday, but they are always up to par with what meets your style or craving. They also have another location up north off of 104th by the Promenade Shops and movie theatre if you are on that side of town. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=160,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.088,4.0

214,Dana H.,"Centennial, CO",2,21,,1.0,2012-02-07,"The 1st time we visited BJ's was right before Christmas and the food was terrible and after sending back my entree once, the manager came out to apologize.  I mean, who advertises a dish with pine nuts and then leaves them out?  The service was also very slow and what could've been an easy dinner in/out at Chili's, this place took hours.  After that I figured it wouldn't be my 1st choice to go again and we only live 5 mins away. Today my husband thought we should give it a second shot and I'm sad to say I agreed.  Even sadder to say that my food was bad & I've had an upset stomach since arriving home.   The waitress pounced on us a minute after we were sat and seemed irritated that we didn't know what we wanted to drink or if we wanted an appetizer.  I cracked the menu and reluctantly placed our order.  The speed of her first appearance was the only fast thing we got today.  Drinks took almost 10 minutes to arrive at our table.  The iced tea tasted old and stale and I had to ask our server twice for sweetener.  Another 10 minutes later our chips & salsa arrived.  The salsa bowl being barely half full and was gone before half the chips were gone.  Extra salsa would be addt'l so we opted out.  20 minutes later our order was taken and another 20 minutes later our food arrived.  I think the cook should go back in training.  Serving pasta that is still yellow and highly undercooked is a rookie mistake.  My sons pizza was burnt.  My husband's shrimp tacos had shrimp that could've been considered undercooked.  Drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes and when the refills arrived, so did the check.  For 3 adults & 1 kid, we paid $72 for LUNCH!  And it was crap food. I will not be going back to BJ's again.  I gave them 2 chances and both times have been well below par with the service being freaking awful.  Had the restaurant been busy when we went today, I'd given more stars... but our waitress had 4 small tables, so there is no excuse for her being MIA so often.  I think I'll be giving my business to other restaurants who value their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=260,3.88,3.88,3.88,2.7560000000000002,3.88

195,Na P.,"Thornton, CO",5,22,,1.0,2012-04-02,"We went in at almost 10pm last Saturday night.  There were some patrons there but it was far from being busy.   Our drinks came out pretty fast.  It took a while for us to place our food order.  But when we did, we ordered stuffed mushrooms and fried artichoke hearts to start, and then added a pizza to share.   I asked for a straw for my drink and never received it.  Our appetizers came out pretty fast (it was delivered by another waitress).  Not shortly after our pizza arrived, however, it was warm but with a place known for their pizzas, this should have been pipin' hot.  This is not the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star. Reason for the 1 star - The lack of customer service,  not only to us but everyone in her section.  It was a night full of waiting - from ordering our food to getting our take out boxes, to receiving our tab and to processing our payment.  Apparently she waited until all of her tables needed/requested boxes so that she can go get them ALL at once.  The same happened when we wanted our tabs, she went to grab the tabs ALL at once and then she processed the payments ALL at the same time.  It was so bad that one guy walked around the entire place looking for her!  Basically we got everything at her convenience.   Ridiculous service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=220,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.724,3.6800000000000006

113,Allison F.,"Aurora, CO",91,422,49.0,4.0,2012-04-12,"Came here for lunch on Monday. We were quickly seated and it looks like a popular place for business groups. We enjoyed that the seating was a fair distance from each other so you got a more private dining experience. Even though there were only a few tables occupied, it was still fairly noisy. The menu is indeed huge for both drinks and food. I had the berry cider that is made in house and it's a nice change up from your traditional apple. We had a hard time making choices with the food menu and it might actually be too large. I finally decided on the california burger, my husband had the potato skins, and my friend had the fried artichokes, mac and cheese, and tomato and mozzerella salad from the 'small plates' section.  My burger was served on thick texas toast and I liked the addition of the green chilis and the avocado. It was quite a heavy burger and kept me full for the rest of the day/evening. My husband was served 10 potato skins, which were enough to feed him for lunch and dinner. And the little plates my friend got were all very good. I had an artichoke and it was delicious. The mac and cheese was enjoyed, though the tomato salad was too salty. Overall, we had a good visit here. Their patio is huge and looks like an ideal place to be on a sunny day. We've tried to come here for dinner on a weekend and the lineups get to be huge. Either arrive early or see if you can make a reservation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=180,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.12,3.7200000000000006
153,Jay D.,"Broomfield, CO",13,8,14.0,5.0,2012-05-02,"My visit here didn't start out good. It was my first time at a BJ's and when I sat down and ordered Dr. Pepper... I was told they don't serve Dr. Pepper!!! The humanity!!! How do these places stay in business when they don't serve the nectar of life!?!? (truth be told, I boycott places that don't serve Dr. Pepper--meals just aren't the same without it). So while I was mortified and having to eat good food without good drink, I decided to stay. I had a gift card. ...otherwise I literally might have walked out. So why five stars??? Read on. My burger came out with avocado only on half so I wasn't too pleased with that either. But no big deal, they can bring me more avocado. The manager came around to each table, asking how things were. When he got to me I gave a little smile and said things were okay. This manager could read through my fake smile, however, and asked what he could do to make it better. I told him there was nothing he could do, just that I was greatly disappointed they didn't serve Dr. Pepper. He apologized but eventually moved away. Literally 5 minutes later he showed back up at my table with a cold bottle of Dr. pepper on a tray!!! FREE of charge! HE LITERALLY WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GAS STATION AND BOUGHT ME ONE!!! WOW... that's customer service. I was ready to write a mediocre review and never go back... but how can I not give the management the props they deserve? They know how to please their customers. He did mention that they would start carrying Dr. Pepper about two weeks later. I haven't been back yet to find out. But I likely will. Good service brings repeat customers.

The avocado spring rolls are awesome. But the service here is awful and getting worse. We came here in May with some out of state friends. The food was great but again our service was bad. We waited for 10 mins after our food was brought out for refills on our drinks, the server had forgotten so when we stopped him again he said he would get them out right away, No apology though. After our meal he brought out our check and we asked if we could get a military discount. He said yes, but needed a manager's approval and went to take the ID cards. That's when we told him politely that he can't take our military id cards away from the table, and that if the manager needed to see our ids he can come to our table. This was the 3rd time being here and we NEVER had the server try to take our ID's (nor EVER had any restaurant try and take our ID's away from the table). He said we would go get his manager. 15 mins later No manager came but he returned with our check with a military discount.  Our most recent t trip and our last to this restaurant our waitress was awful! We ordered an appetizer she said she would get us some plates and silverware. 10 minutes later we got our appetizer but still no plates, or silverware. When my husband got the attention of a different waitress, we asked for plates, and silverware. She rolled her eyes at us! And said ""yeah hold on."" (In a real pissy tone) Finally our food came. But my grandma was having a problem eating her sandwich, the bread was falling apart. When our waitress came walking by we got her attention. When I asked for a new slice of bread she said "" yes sure. But just so you know the bread will fall apart again it's just the multigrain bread they use. But Next time you come ask them to toast it for you it holds it together better.""  Umm why not toast the bread I just asked you to bring out? Instead my grandma said no thank you ill just eat it with a fork and knife. We were all a bit frustrated at this point with our service. Again when she brought our check we asked for military discount. She stated they don't offer military discount. When we asked if that just happened, because they have offered it in the past she told us they've never offered military discount (Also in a really pissy tone). Finally we've had enough my husband asked to speak to a manager. About 15 mins later she returned with NO manager, no apology, but with our check including military discount on ONE of our drinks so the total discount was $1.00 off a $65 bill. We were insulted I can't believe how awful the service is her.  We will NEVER return to this restaurant again.  As for the manager I hope he realizes that his employees need a talking to about professionalism. Rolling your eyes at a customer is so disrespectful and shouldn't be tolerated. If I hadn't of been there with my family, and it was just my husband and myself we would have left then!

Awful....just awful!   First, we were greeted nicely and sat promptly...but after this it all went downhill FAST....well, slowly.....!  We were not greeted or even acknowledged by a server/greeter for at least 10 minutes (and that's after we had been sitting for a bit and decided to see how long it would take to get a shout out and taking note of the time on our clocks.....). It would be important to also note that after this ridiculous wait (10 plus minutes) my Husband finally got up and politely asked the hostess what was going on....just a water at the point would have been welcomed.  After about 5 minutes after that we finally got a less than interested waitress.  She didn't apologize at all and HAD to have known we were irritated -- Im certain I had it written all over my face. It's just so rude. BUT, I believe in being polite so I pulled it together and treated her nicely. The other thing that really rubbed me the wrong was was that during this period of LONG waiting... I saw the Manager (maybe 2 of them -- I can't be certain)....stroll (and by stroll I mean slllooooowly work their way to the other side of the restaurant -- clearly they didn't want to be there either so I can see why the service sucks so bad) past our table more than a few times.  Did they not notice we were sitting there FOREVER without even a greet or drink order (I know they know this....the coaster on the table after a first greet is a great indicator). Clearly even management didn't care....  As a restaurant manager I certainly notice these things when I'm on the job....or even a customers staring eye?  Nope....not these guys! WOW!     We ordered a lot of food for old times sake -- things we missed and had to try during our visit to the city.  The food of course was good...but the service and lack of care really took all ""longing"" for the food away!  I was pretty disgusted to be treated so poorly on what seemed to be a slower day.  Now, in all honesty...it was a Sunday and I KNOW the Sunday crowd can be rough -- but seriously -- get it together! We left a 20% tip -- I'm not sure why -- I regret it, but again...I always have a soft spot when it comes to this because I have spent so much time in the industry.  What a sucker!   We won't be back....there are WAY too many options to choose from to decide on a place with such hideous service all the way around.  No thank you!  I wonder why corporate hasn't come to straighten this store out -- shocking!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8280000000000003,3.1200000000000006

The first time I visited was at a BJ's on the way to Boulder from Denver, and I almost swore them off for life due to terrible service, but that's old news.  My experience at this BJ's was quite different, and the bartender, whose name I cannot remember now, deserves to be running the place. I had just got back from Chicago on Monday evening May 5th. I hadn't eaten dinner yet, and this was one of the only places open in the area.  The food is some of the best I've ever had at a chain restaurant like this, and they had a happy hour going that made drinks and food nice and cheap. The highlight of the evening however, as I already mentioned, was the bartender. She was the exact opposite of the staff at the last BJs I went to. She was funny, she sparked some conversation without being overzealous, it was the end of the day and she still had a smile on her face.

152,Sheila C.,"Denver, CO",4,25,5.0,2.0,2014-06-21,"Yelp might do better to have separate ratings for food & service.  My friend and I came early on this summer Saturday. We simply wanted to have a drink and an appetizer or two.  Our waitress took our order promptly but it felt like she was disappointed that we were not having a full meal and started out only ordering one appetizer. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the same time as our drinks. Our drinks came promptly and then the small platter of a small amount of mushrooms came. No napkins, no table service. My friend did not want to make a fuss about it. But after eating the mushroom my hands were dripping. I signaled for the waitress who was busy chatting up another employee who alerted her. She sauntered over to the table with a big ol' attitude and plunked down the silverware wrapped in a cloth napkin with what looked like a forced smile. No words. All her communication with us was prefunctory, and in an unfriendly tone. As it was I ordered a second drink and a couple of more appetizers so the bill increased. I tipped her 20% but she would have gotten more if she'd been friendly and done her job properly.  The calamari was good and the creamy sauce it came with was tasty. My Margarita was not good.

Our daughter fries and drink did not come, only her entree came. When our sever came back we ordered our appetizers and asked for the rest of what our daughter ordered. She brought back our daughters drinks and our drinks and took our order. After waiting and waiting our food came out. Never our appetizers and the food was brought incorrect. At this point we had been there almost an hour, and nothing had gone well, we hadn't even had a bite to eat. We were both so appalled by the overall worst experience we have ever had and were beyond frustrated we sought out the manager who was eating at a table in the back.

Waiters and waitresses usually come very quickly with menus and ask us what we want to drink. The happy hour doesn't start until 10pm so usually when we go it's too early but we get a beer anyways. My boyfriend always gets the Jeremiah red which is a dark strong beer and I get something fruity and light. The apricot ale is pretty good. And of course we get a single chocolate chunk pizookie which is this warm chocolate chip cookie topped with French vanilla ice cream. It's a heavenly mix of sweetness and both warm soft cookie with the chilling pairing if the ice cream. This is definitely one of my favorite desserts on earth!:) Pizookie also comes in a flight form with three smaller pizookies so if you wanted to try more flavors, get the flight!

198,Marci A.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,2015-04-03,"I've only set foot into this place twice and that was enough for me to know that I'll never be back.  The first time I went it was the first beautiful sunny day of Spring and my boyfriend and I wanted to sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine. Well, the hostesses made a fuss about sitting us on the patio for some reason and when they finally took us out there they put us at a table in the shade so I asked nicely if we could sit in the sun. ""Ugh, let me grab my towel... again,"" said the hostess. Our waitress was nice, thank goodness, but the hostesses, not so much. The second time, my mom was visiting from Georgia and we were in the area and decided to have a beer on the patio. Another beautiful sunny day and we saw people sitting on the patio so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside. ""The patio is closed."" she said to us, even though it was a gorgeous day and there were people already sitting out there. I informed her that there were people sitting there and that they were losing business by not opening the outside on a 80 degree day. We weren't about to waste such a gorgeous day so we obviously went somewhere else. Advice to the owner, open the patio or tell your hostesses to lose the attitude. If a customer wants to sit at a certain table or a certain part of the restaurant, accommodate them. They will continue to give you business.

It was dry, gross, and ridiculously small. The only thing that I would recommend from this place was a the mixed drink they had called ""A Drink like that"" and the sliders. Everything else is was pretty bad and overpriced. The drinks we had were the Jeremiah Red, the PM Porter, The Dark Side of the Moom, and a Drink like that. To be fair, I visit an excessive amount of local brewries and craft beers can be hit or miss. But these beers here were bellow par. If your just looking to try something different and don't care much for taste or quality this is place to go. If I was tell you why the  Jeremiah  Red and PM Porter were bad I would simply say the yeast had not been properly fermented at the right temperature. It was excessively bitter and the red ale I had here before did not have that level of bitterness. The food we ordered was the parmessan chicken, top sirloin, stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls, double chocolate pzookie, and sliders. The egg roll and mushroom appetizers had almost identical fillings. The stuffed mushrooms were clearly the better of two but as you can see from the images many of the egg roll and mushroom appz were overcooked and even blackened at some points. With that said I still enjoyed most of the appz. I just wished it was prepared with a bit more care. I ordered the sliders at the same time I ordered desert simply because I saw multiple people order it and I wanted to actually try a meal that tasteted good before I left. The pzookie was advertised as a American Classic was actually good and the sliderd were great tasting and only $8.95. They were actually cheaper than the egg roll appetizer.

Our food soon came out yet our server never returned. He never asked how our food was or checked up on us, or even asked if we needed anything else ! One of our friends had the Ahi Tuna Salad and said it was decent, another friend had the chicken finger salad and liked it , my mom had the California Chicken Club and liked it , unfortunately my salad was horrible. It was the Berry Brussel sprout  kale salad. The Brussel sprouts were hard and cold not roasted like they said in the description. The Arugula, kale, spinach mix was soggy in the berry dressing. Little amount of nuts and grapes. Would never get again ! Finally after our waiter came back he refilled the tea with no ice of course and was like maybe I should clear these plates.

I know it's a chain restaurant and many poopoo it, but it is seriously one of the only breweries in Aurora. Yes, it is a brewery. They brew on the premises and have a brewmaster. They have seasonal beers. They host beer-pairing events. They are also a restaurant and update their menu frequently. They have happy hour M-F both early and late night. I've never been disappointed in their pizza. Most of the food I've tried has been good to excellent. I've never had to send something back. Service has been from just okay to phenomenal. So, if I compile all of my reviews into just one star score, it is a 4. If it was less, I wouldn't have kept going back. They also have a rewards program and are constantly sending me freebies via email and their new app. I've never paid full price for a meal there, even if it is just a free Pizookie(tm). (It's a cookie pizza and they have killer flavors like Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, S'Mores, etc.) They once had a Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout that knocked my socks off. If they ever have it again, get it, lots of it. If not, get the Tatonka Stout. My personal fave. All of the other beers are well-crafted and you can't go wrong.

We have always sat in the bar area because that's where we're most comforrable. The bartenders have always been very attentive and friendly. They keep a good eye on our drink levels and are quick to talk up the any new beers. The beer selection is good and the seasonals are usually pretty decent. During our last visit we tried the fall seasonals, oktoberfest and the pumpkin. Both were good. The pumpkin was subtle which I liked...a lot. Some pumpkin beers smash you over the head with pumpkin spice. BJ's is noticeable and enjoyable but not in your face. While the beers are always good, the food can be a little hit or miss. Their thin crust pizza and stuffed mushrooms are good. I would steer clear of the sliders. The patty is teeny tiny, like smaller than white castle burgers tiny and they don't have much flavor. The one time we ordered cheese sticks, they weren't melty all the way through. Sad clown face.

As far as an atmosphere goes, this place is awesome.  The food is incredible, too. We've been here twice now in the month that we've lived in Aurora and this place has come through as a solid dinner choice both times. My boyfriend and i were throughly satisfied with our meals, and I was impressed with the beer selection and the elaborate menu they were displayed on, with a guide to help you pair your meal and beer together perfectly.  Our servers both times were very friendly and informative. The only slight complaint I had was that it seemed a little under staffed. The first time we went in was on a Tuesday, so it wasn't that busy and I felt like the service was a little slower than it should have been.

The food is usually really good.  The service is hit or miss.  Yesterday we had a late lunch and ordered 2 appetizers and a pizza.  We asked them to substitute mushrooms in place of tomatoes.  And also the the chicken wing be extra crispy.  The chicken wings were good, bit the skin was rubbery, then the pizza didn't have mushrooms and they put them on and put it back thru the oven which made the normal yummy buttery crust hard like  a petrified tree in the forest.  My other pet peeve with this place is that when you have 5 people sitting at a table meant for 4 with out grabby kiddos, I would really love that you take away as much as you can of used dishes, not set down main course and walk away while leaving a stacked (by me) pile of dishes.  We are tight on space to start with!!!!!

128,Sara R.,"Denver, CO",9,51,69.0,4.0,2016-01-30,"I think this place deserves more than the 3 stars given by other reviewers because it is one place in Aurora that you can get a little vibe going. If you want beers and TV's they have a really nice set-up. Great for football games because, in the bar, I can see all the TV's and the tables aren't crammed together. If you want a cozy booth for a romantic date, they have that too. The dining room can also accommodate very large groups so it would be good for holidays or office lunches. The dining room reminds me a little of Maggianos where it is open and decorated to the hilt. The beer list is very, very good. I am a picky beer drinker and I found at least three good beers: the brew house blonde, the Tatonka Porter and the Jeremiah Red, all native to BJ's. They have a bunch of common domestics like Blue Moon and Kona Brewery. Tons of IPA's. The food was better than decent. I don't like deep dish pizza but theirs is light and fluffy!!! (Not sure how you do that unless there is egg in the dough?!? Seriously it was that fluffy.) The deep dish Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza was yummy. I had the avocado egg rolls as a meal and, with the sauce, it was a solid 6. I say give it a shot.

I've been here a couple times in the past, but in the last year Jess M. and I have been coming here quite often as it's just down the road from us.  It's a place we come for a quick impromptu date night.  They have great beers, the wine list isn't too bad either, and they do have some good signature cocktails. We've sampled much from the menu, pizza is tasty, and most of the appetizers are good.  The only thing that I would recommend avoiding is the sliders, as the meat is the same size as the pickle on it.  Other than that I love everything I've tried here.  And I would be remiss if I neglected to make special mention of the pizza cookies (which apparently are bad for my heart and that brings up a source of contention between me and my bride to be which will not affect your review at all provided of course that you make it a point to sneak me a salted caramel as often as possible when she goes to the ladies room but I digress). Service is always great.  We always sit at the bar and they have consistently impressed us.  And the ladies at the host stand are always smiling and welcoming.

That was really tasty. And a few others had steaks. They looked delicious but getting them was a weird scenario. After the 2 people ordered their steaks, they were told they were all out of them about 10min later. They ask to change up the size of the steaks and prices(I think they asked for 2 7oz steaks for the price of the 14 or something of that nature), and the server went to ask a manager and then miraculously, they had the original sized steaks.

We ordered water and drinks for 3 of our party first. It took an unusually long time for our waiter to bring them.    We then ordered dinner which was brought quickly enough by other staff. We needed a couple more plates and had to wait to flag down our waiter to bring them.    He never returned to refill our water glasses that sat there empty for most of the meal. We felt that this job might not be what he was cut out for. He was easily confused in taking both our dinner and dessert orders.

This was not a DoorDash issue but BJ's forgetting these items. My boys meals were not complete. DoorDash did rectify the problem. Then a few days later we went to BJ's with my dad who was visiting from out of town. It was strangely busy for a Wednesday night. However, we were seated at a table that still had drinks, napkins and check on it. My dads tacos were wrong and I was missing lemon in my water (small error). The food again was good, but I am becoming more and more unimpressed with service and accountability. With my dads tacos they did correct it before he asked, which was awesome, but all these errors in such short time for parties that are not big is turning me off from wanting to eat there physically or takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora?start=20,3.04,3.25,3.352,,3.166

I was pleasantly surprised how the menu has changed with excellent vegetarian options past a traditional salad list. They even have small plate options that gave the feel of tapas eating style.

84,Sarah F.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-01,"On 7/29, my husband and I went to dinner. I ordered the sirloin steak cooked well-done. When my steak arrived, it was (at best) cooked medium. My plate was covered in bloody juice. I brought this to the attention of my server. She agreed that it was not cooked per my order. She took my steak back from me on a separate plate. While I waited for my steak, I tried to eat my baked potato. My baked potato was still hard and also not cooked all the way through. Since my steak was already messed up, I didn't both with requesting a new potato. I waited about 15 to 20 more minutes to get my steak back. This time, it is burned. I accepted it and left it at that. When my server came back, she said that her manager wanted to send me out a fresh side of asparagus for my steak since the original steak was undercooked. That never came. The server asked me after when we were finishing up if I still wanted that asparagus since it still hadn't come out. We didn't bother getting it.  When I have had my food undercooked at other restaurants, the manager has always been the one to bring it back to me to confirm it being made correctly. I am disappointed that this BJs manager stayed in the back and let the server do all the work. I am also disappointed that the manager would offer a free side and then not follow through with making sure it was delivered. I do believe that after this failure occurred, the manager should have at the very least offered a free dessert or to discount our bill in some way. None of this happened.  I very much doubt I'll be coming back to this place any time soon. It was horrible cooking for a $50+ meal. Seriously floored that someone could manage to screw up making a baked potato of all things.  I do want to single out Shonte's (Shante?) service.

I've been eating at BJs for years and have not had such a bad experience as I have had yesterday. We had a group of 5, with three of us not exactly skinny minnies and they tried to seat us in a small table (not even offering to move tables together) so we declined and asked to sit in a booth, which the hostess quite rudely said 'those tables are reserved for parties of 6 or more'. First of all, I saw three tables of four sitting at these round booths so that excuse was invalid. Secondly, we're not the skinniest of people, we probably could have been considered party of 7+ (weight wise) if you wanted to get technical. Our waitress Gena R. was amazing compared to the crap show of people hired at this location. She was attentive and kind and honestly the only good thing at this restaurant. The food was decent but the presentation of some things were severely lacking. The jambalaya plate was sloppily thrown together and they didn't even have the courtesy to wipe the edges clean before presenting it to us. The flatbread was cut very haphazardly, some pieces 1 inch while some were 3 inches. Very hard to eat when we were trying to divide it up between our group of 5.  The attitude of the workers here also needs to be improved. They literally smirked at us as they were delivering the food to the table.

We ordered the avocado egg rolls and the barbecue chicken salad (with no cheese). I am very allergic to blue cheese, and I have had allergic reactions to some types of honey (usually mild, itchy throat, etc.) After letting the server know about the allergy, I was assured my meal contained neither. After eating we got into the car to drive home, and I realised my ears were itchy. We didn't even make it all the way home, my husband had to pull over the car so that I could vomit. By the time I got home my lips were blue and I was covered head to toe in purple hives. Thankfully I own an EpiPen for an allergy to bees, but anaphylaxis is extremely unpleasant for those who've experienced it. My husband called the restaurant to ask whether there was a possibility that the sauce for the egg rolls may have contained honey, they told him they asked the chef and he said the sauce came in a box, they didn't know the ingredients, so they couldn't say for sure.  I don't know whether the salad came into contact with blue cheese or if the honey in the sauce was the culprit, but I don't feel comfortable eating at a restaurant that doesn't know what ingredients are actually in their sauces, and I think the restaurant could have at the very least apologised to us about the issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-aurora,3.52,3.37,3.332,,3.43
