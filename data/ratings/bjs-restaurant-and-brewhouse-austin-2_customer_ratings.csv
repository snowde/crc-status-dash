325,Jake O.,"Austin, TX",31,76,1.0,3.0,2012-01-02,"Three cheers for the mini-bruschetta!  It's delicious and just about the right size for 3 bucks, even though it probably cost 5 cents to put together. I have been to this location twice now and sat at the bar both times. If you want great service, grab a seat at the bar.  This location has a great beer selection in addition to their homemade brews. Not sure why you would come here to drink Miller Lite or some other watery beer unless you like paying $10 for a sandwich. Or $20 for a large pizza. Look, the food is okay. Both times I have gone to this location I ordered the pizza. Both times the dough-to-topping ratio has been way off. All dough and very little topping. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it.  But, I'm a sucker for big screens and beer so inevitably I give in and order food. The Jeremiah Red is delicious. The Grand Cru (they already ran out), even better. My suggestion would be to go during Happy Hour (3-7 I think) where they offer half price mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and $1 off their brews. Or, just go for the beer and grab a sandwich from Potbelly next door on your way home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=360,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9560000000000004,3.3200000000000003

136,Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14.0,5.0,2012-01-03,"We were very impressed with BJ's and suprised of all the negative reviews.  Usually when we go to a brewery, I have found I dislike the beers and end up choking one down or getting a regular beer if available.  Of the four beers we tried, we really liked all four of them.  The Piranha was our fave, followed by the Brewnette and the red.  We look forward to trying all the rest of them. We got appetizers for our meal.  I really liked the mozzarella & tomato salad, and for only three bucks it was a good deal.  The sliders were good, and we got a large pile of fries for just $1.  The stuffed mushrooms were good too.  I want to try the thai wontons next time.  We noticed too late that the appetizer pizzas were half off, so we will have to try that next time. Also, we wanted the dessert cookie with ice cream (forgot what they call it) but of course we can't agree on a cookie or the ice cream.  They can customize it, do 1/2 batter of one and 1/2 batter of your other choice and whatever two ice cream flavors you want!  It was really good and hit the spot. I really liked the ambiance of the place... dark wood, cosy, clean restrooms.  We are looking forward to going back to try more beers and some different food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.22,3.4800000000000004

Porter (big fan!). For meals, my gal had an ""Enlightened Entree"" (less than 550 calories); specifically, the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta. And I had the Santa Fe Salad. The pasta did not look very good, nor was it filling as my very yummy salad was being pirated by the owner of the pasta.

I've only gone when I tagged along with a big group of people for a birthday not on my own free will. I lived in San Diego dbag city and these places riddled every exit on the freeway.

225,David A.,"Clarksville, TN",4,87,1.0,3.0,2012-02-06,"Very good pizza with some decent beers but LOUD. We ate here as a party of four on a Friday night and had to wait for about 20 minutes. It is a typical mid-level restaurant so they gave you a buzzer and you had the option of waiting at the bar but it was packed. The service was below par. I had to wait about eight minutes for her to fix a drink order during which she passed our table three times (she forgot to bring a slice of lime with the drink). The brewery has some of it's own brews but nothing really stood out. The food itself was very good I thought. I had a small pizza and the cheese and ingredients tasted great.

132,Jack N.,"Austin, TX",240,353,37.0,4.0,2012-02-13,"We had a nice little meal here after running errands.  In fact, the only way I agreed to run errands, much less brave the horror that is Arbor Walk, was to be able to stop somewhere for a bite and a brew. Veek suggested BJs, and after a short moment of considering the possibilities of what she meant, I agreed that the brew house would be fine.  I wanted to try it, I had only been to a BJs one other time and it was fine, if not remarkable. We're trying to eat a bit healthier and one tactic is portion control, so a lot of times we split items   We both ordered a bowl of soup (pro tip - their ""small' soup is well over a cup and plenty unless its your main meal), but we split a burger.   Lest you start worrying about our sanity, we did also split a pitcher of their house made hefeweizen.  Calm down, we're old but not senile. The forced patter of the wait staff is somewhat off-putting:  ""Would like you try one of our appetizers such as XYZ"" and ""Would you like something to drink, perhaps one of our signature cocktails such as the ABC"".....  but our server was prompt, friendly and efficient.  Really, hard to fault her for the ridiculous policies of the restaurant.  It sounds for all the world like they took it right out of ""Office Space"". Food was good, beer wasn't bad, and service was fine.

Came at 2pm on a Sunday and there was no wait.  Waitress came over immediately and my fiance ordered a Chimay Red and I got a root beer with a double shot of Absolut vanilla. Sublime.  We ordered the chicken pot stickers for appetizers and they were delicious.  A short time later our entrees arrived. My fiance ordered the new mahi mahi tacos and really enjoyed them. I got my usual broiled Atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice. It came with a huge amount of butter-soaked vegetables that I just pushed to the side. I got the chardonnay-lemon sauce on the side and it was SO good. Salmon portion was HUGE. Perfectly cooked. I ordered 3 drinks and was surprised to be charged $3.90 for the root beer all 3 times. I guess no free refills on that since I was ordering $10 worth of vodka. Thought they'd throw in the root beer for free the 2nd and 3rd times. Didn't happen.   Our service was great, nothing really wrong, but just cannot give 5 stars. Reserving that for our dinner at Craft Steak in Vegas in April...I hope.

With the expanisve menu, we asked our waitress, Christina, for her recommendations.  She was candid about the strengths of the menu, which were especially helpful with our appetizers.  Both the meatball appetizer and the fried cheese were excellent.  My dinner of the BBQ beef sandwich was excellent.  The fried onion strings on top of it may have been the best onion strings I've had in ages. The BBQ sandwich was more like a great roast beef sandwich slathered in BBQ sauce, reminding me of Jason's Deli's ""Deli Cowboy"" sandwich back when they served it.

Because I'm only 25, I took childlike joy in walking through the revolving door over and over (sorry, dining partner)! We were seated quickly. I was pretty puzzled with the erratic decor, but it somehow works. Our server was excellent and on my next visit, I'll make sure to request his section.  For libations, I had the Nutty Brewnette and it's pretty great. Being a sucker for mushrooms anywhere, everywhere, all the time, I knew that I'd be ordering the spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty standard, which means that they were completely awesome. We couldn't resist ordering the fried artichokes, and the dipping sauce was delicious. For our entree, we split a vegetable pizza on a whole wheat crust. It nearly had me screaming ""PIZZA!"" over and over again, because it was without a doubt one of the better deep dish pizzas I've ever eaten.

Other times it's - not really a big deal either way. I've eaten there 3-4 times and every time my entree has tasted fine, but it hasn't been anything special or worthy of eating out. There are tons of better options for every type of food on the menu. The most disappointing aspect of BJ's is that their personally hand crafted brews are subpar to everything else they have tap. Fortunately, what they have on tap is a reasonable selection of good beer. The ahi poke appetizer is really good so I'm happy ordering that when I go. The other times I keep trying out new dishes hoping to find something really enticing. The pazookie is an above average dessert too considering how many of them they probably make.

My meal was comped and I figured I would give it another try in the future Fail, part deux.  This time I brought my mother along after a Dr. appt. in the area and she ordered the broiled tilapia while I tried the soup and salad combo featuring clam chowder. The chowder was hot and tasty; the salad was insipid and forgettable.  But that wasn't the big problem.  The waiter brought my entire meal out nearly 15 minutes before my mother's meal arrived.  I was forced to go ahead and at least eat my soup before it got cold, while my Mom got the dubious pleasure of watching me.   To top off the questionable experience (BTW, the waiter never came by before bringing her entree out), Mom's tilapia meal was lukewarm.  We opted not to spend the additional time for them to warm it up and again, when the manager came by, we pointed out the problems and suggested that when entrees like this are delivered, it is usual to bring the salad out ahead (if the patron agrees), but not a great choice to bring the entire lunch for one while the other waits. He agreed and they comped half of the check.  I don't know how they can survive with this kind of performance, but I will not be going there again.  There are too many good options in that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.372,3.4400000000000004

Don't set your expectations too high, it's not an uppity type of place, just what we were looking to try. Yes, 1st time at a BJ's, ever. Very sticky floor on the way over to the bar. Something must've spilled and wasn't cleaned up well at all. Our drinks were served within reasonable wait. We started with the Ultimate Iced Teas and chose to finish with them even though they were just okay ($10/ea.). Service was a very solid average. Reading the menu I notice the ""deep dish"" pizza. and think that's a great starter piece. We ordered the small sized (size #2 of 4) Classic Combo and added onion/pepper. The pizza came in expected time, however, it was just warm and not hot. The dough was chewy and seamed under-cooked. Toppings we distributed in an acceptable amount. Note: nothing ""great"" happening here, never mind excellent. Next we ordered the calamari. There was a reasonable amount and it was very warm, still not hot. But the squid was horrible. The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long.

The menu is strong all around: good salads, pizza, wings, burgers, and just about anything else you could want.  The beer menu is large, offering both in house brewed beers and others on tap. Prices are average for a brewhouse. Be careful about going here during peek times, especially on weekends. The wait can get long. The place sports a ton of flat screens, so it makes a great place to have a meal and catch the game. The staff is generally attentive and helpful, although we did have a newbie that was so nice it was borderline scary.

Wrong, the hostess sat us in a booth by the bar and the ginormous TVs, cool. While looking over the menu and the interior I realized that BJs reminds me of the old 99 restaurants I used to frequent when I lived in Boston. A family friendly pub - restaurant with good but not great food.  Well the service was very good, our drinks were always full and our appetizers and entrees were served promptly.  My appetizer a house salad was pretty weak but passable. My dining companion ordered the tomato soup and he said it was great. We both ordered steaks and they were OK not great but fine. My medium rare steak was really medium to medium well but it was seasoned very nicely. My companion had a couple of their beers and he said they were good.

322,El V.,"Austin, TX",3,126,5.0,4.0,2012-05-22,"New lunch specials finally lured us in the door. Staff was great and place was spotless. Don't see many places with a revolving door! I had the en-light-end menu item with a half flat bread pizza (California) and it came with a tiny little salad where dressing was not evenly coating all the pieces of lettuce, a very minor thing. I want to reiterate, the salad was just tiny, but the half sized order of pizza was filling enough for a small lady like me. Nice touch leaving the cucumber and tomato on the side of the salad instead of mixing them in like most places do. The flat bread pizza was AMAZING! Crust was awesomely crispy and the toppings were just divine. My date had the classic burger with thin fries and it was fantastic. I would give 5 stars except that the staff was really trying to upsell us on appetizers and deserts to the point of being sorta annoying. Also tried to clear my date's plate while we were still munching on the last of his fries. Don't try to hurry us out when business is slow, if there were people waiting for a table we would've hustled but the lunch rush was definitely over. On the flip side we were checked on frequently and our drinks were always full, so great service on that aspect. I suspect the upselling tactic is an agenda pushed by management. Maybe I'd order the chips and salsa if they were not $5. I mean seriously, five bucks for chips and salsa (which many places give out for free) when the new chicken fried steak is only $6.50 until 3pm? What non-sense. Could write an entire second review on the beers. If you like beer you will NOT be left wanting.

We all arrived approx within 10min of each other. Table was set adequately. We ordered drinks for 4 people while we initially waited, took about 15 min. After all parties arrived we ordered food which took over a 45min hr to reach our table.  I ordered Angel Hair pasta Toscana. It arrived as Spaghetti and they didn't tell me it was going to be substituted. I alerted the manager. Nice guy. 20 min later the waiter came to tell me that they were going to substitute the pasta. It tasted good but dish would have been better suited with Angel Hair. They comp-ted my entree and it was a pleasant surprise. I was hoping for some free sour dough bread or salsa n chips but I guess BJs doesn't wanna give out those types of fillers for free. The raspberry tea I ordered was awful. Returned it and ordered regular sweet tea. Refills took about 45min to an hour. One server for 16 people. Our server said he had back up and the girl helping him told us she was helping out but bailed once the rest of our party arrived. Our waiter was very nice and apologetic. He got a good tip.

143,Stef S.,"Austin, TX",90,262,116.0,4.0,2012-06-09,"Come on, admit it: you've chuckled at the name, too. Regardless, BJ's is one of the better chains out there. I like to think of it as the Cheesecake Factory for Men: both have ridiculously large portions for what you pay for and extensive menus. There's something for everybody when the menu is the length of a novel.  As with many brewhouse eateries, I think the house beer is made so as not to overwhelm the food. I can't think of one that's really memorable besides the berry cider that they have, and that's only sort of related to the beers. The berry cider is like a fizzy pinky-purpley glass of fruity Sprite. It's fantastic. I haven't had a beer here that I haven't liked, but I haven't had one that I'd go out of my way to seek out, either. They're all pretty simple brews--no strong flavors or complex flavor combinations. So, I suppose they're good to sip on with food.  The food and service at this BJ's are the bigger reasons why I'd come back. Service was attentive. Even when I've just ordered a glass of water because it was past my bedtime (hey, get off my lawn!), they made sure that it always stayed full. The food is a bit less salty and processed-tasting than many chains and for that, I'm thankful. The salmon is flavorful, flaky and huge. The deep-dish pizzas--while not a true Chicago-style deep dish--are still fantastic. They're like big, fluffy cheese breads with fabulous toppings all over. Their take on the southwestern eggroll is delicious and not over-fried to the point of being greasy and gross. Overall, it's pretty tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=200,3.2,3.17,3.17,2.9280000000000004,3.182

327,Van D.,"Round Rock, TX",2,4,,3.0,2012-07-05,"I came here July 3rd and it wasn't busy enough for there to be a waiting line, so that was great. I loved the lighting, atmosphere and company was pleasant so I was pretty open minded with the food.  As a heath conscious eater, I'm kinda wary of eating out because I'm never sure of the options available. And paying $10 for a salad? No. Just no. I can make those salads at home.  So with my eating habit, I was grateful to learn that BJ's have the ""Enlightened Entrees"", which are all under 575 calories. I chose the Creole Tilapia simply because I like fish and tomatoes. My two friends got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and a shrimp pasta dish, the name of which I couldn't remember. The guy who's not driving got a Jeremiah Red.  The food came out about 10 minutes later, which I think is decent. My dish was pretty decent. The fish is well-cooked, the sauce is good, the side salad is not bad. For those who don't eat too salty like me, know that the tapenade is salty because of the anchovies. On the health perspective, the dish is pretty balanced: a third each of grain, protein and vegetables. Overall, I would eat it again.  My friends had no complaints about their dishes. The Jeremiah Red, I had  a small sip of at the beginning of the meal, is good even though I don't drink beer in general. We ordered a triple chocolate pizookie because we heard it was good. Personally, I was way to rich for me so sharing was a good idea. While it was good and my friends did enjoy it to, we didn't finish it simply because it was so rich. I am glad to go back to my 72% dark chocolate and home made ice cream after that.  One complaint, the waiter was terrible with refilling water, terrible enough that one of friend got a bit mad and gave only $1 tip. And I got thirsty enough that I asked to drink from my friend's cup.

Maybe that's what led to the mistake that ensued:  I ordered a calzone.  I figured if the pizzas are really good, the calzones are probably just as good.  But first I was served the wrong order.  They brought me someone else's calzone, so obviously I sent it back.  I got the correct one soon enough, but it was almost half dough.  That was a big disappointment.  Paying that much for just a loaf of bread just isn't right.  I said as much to the server, who just agreed that yes, it was a lot of dough. I'm sure I will return here, but I have to lower the rating for now. ********* This place reeks of chain restaurant, but that's not entirely bad.  The ambience is raucous and loud, and given that there is a huge -- and I mean HUGE -- set of 4 TV screens behind the bar it stays like that most of the time.  If you can ignore that everything else about this place is good.  The TV screens obviously makes this place a sports bar type of place, but the food is a step up from that kind of food.  If you've experienced Cover 2 and Cover 3, B.J.'s tries to be that kind of place. The pizzas are their specialty.  They are very good, actually.  I have had the Meat Lover's equivalent.  I liked it.  Unless you're barely hungry you should get a small.  The mini is barely more than a pizza roll. The seared ahi tuna small bite is actually very good.  Be careful with the wasabi, though.  It's about twice as strong as any wasabi I've had with sushi, so it can be overpowering. My choice the past couple of times has been a salad.  Their BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent.  This last time I tried the honey chicken salad.  It was ok.  Not that great, but still good.  I tried it with the bleu cheese dressing, but the dressing had gone bad.  If you try anything with the bleu cheese dressing ask for it on the side.  It can go bad. Their beer selection is very good.  If you're looking for a place to go just for the beer and some pub food to watch a game, this is an excellent option.  They have seasonal beers that rotate in and out of their lineup, as well as plenty of other domestic and international choices.

None of the vegies were seasoned with anything and the steak was over seasoned. Even my iced tea was watered down and tasteless. The wait service was not good either. Waiter kept interrupting us. He seemed fine with talking to us but could not remember to refill my tea. I had to ask many times.  Also waiter did not know the beer menu.

I got the Cajun Pasta, with blackened chicken. The blackened chicken was awful - the seasoning did not match well, the ""application"" of the seasoning was odd. The whole ""blackening"" of the chicken seemed like an after-thought. The pasta itself was cooked well, but again the seasonings were off. The flavors seems disjointed in the entire dish.

Then there's the gf pizookie. Cakey (in a good way) gooey chocolate chip cookie goodness, topped with ice-cream.  Wife even asked (like she sometimes does when she's impressed) if we accidentally got the 'regular' instead of the gluten free.  The waitress said she prefers it over the regular one, and I don't really think she was exaggerating for our benefit Iron out the kitchen inconsistencies, and it would easily be a solid 4*+ place in our 'hood.  As it is, it may just be a ""pick up in a pinch"" kind of place for us.  But the call-ahead curbside pickup is simple and efficient.

Once I ordered a small pizza and got a REALLY small pizza. About four inches across. The waiter said he misunderstood and ordered me the correct size which I wasn't charged for and gave me a small salad while I waited so I could at least have something to eat with the rest of my table. Another time I was asked if I wanted the shoestring fries or the wedge fries. I got the kind I didn't order.  Today I ordered the open face Pot Roast sandwich and that is when seemingly all hell broke loose. Here is the menu description: ""Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables."" My waitress asked what kind of fries I wanted. I double checked the menu to see if I read it right and showed her that it came with veggies as it already had mashed potatoes. I asked her why I would want fries on an item that already came with potatoes and she just shrugged and said, ""You never know.""  Now here is where things get complicated. If a menu item says a dish comes ""with"" something that means in addition to right? Catfish WITH coleslaw. Hamburger WITH fries. Am I not right? The server brings my food MINUS the veggies after what I had just gone through with the waitress. I call him back and he says he will go get them and brings them to me a few minutes later.  This should be the end of the story but no. He makes a point to return to the table presumably to ask me if I liked the veggies to which I responded in the affirmative. He then makes a big point of saying he's glad and that he was going to ""take care"" of them to make me happy even though they don't come with the meal and that in fact the veggies mentioned on the menu description were already included on my plate. What was he referring to? The mushroom gravy on my potatoes? The celery garnish? The handful of shredded carrots? Had he just shut up when he brought me the veggies I wouldn't be writing this. Yes I know the customer is always right but he made a big point of saying I was WRONG but he comped me the veggies that should have been included in the meal to begin with just to make me happy. Big man! you gave 20 cents of ""free"" veggies. Happy now? Way to go! Make yourself look superior to a customer over a cupful of veggies that cost next to nothing.  Had I accepted the offer to SUBSTITUTE fries for my veggies I guess it would have not been an issue but asking for something that was already included in my meal seemingly makes me a problem customer to the employees.  I emailed the management saying they need to amend the menu description from just, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables."" to, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables and a free double helping of grief from the restaurant employees.""

I ordered the deep dish pizza, which was far from deep dish (I now read another review here stating their experience was the same - wish I had seen it before ordering!). It was basically a regular pizza, with slightly puffy crust. And upon our server stating that the small one was in fact really small (less than 6""), I opted for the next size up. Yes, it was enough, but it was NOT worth the $15 price tag. My husband got a steak (which he loves to do wherever we go) and said it wasn't great. It looked pretty charred on the outside, even though the inside was the right color. (The only upside was the baked potato with everything on the side came with nice chunks of what appeared to be fresh-cooked bacon, although it didn't have a lot of bacon flavor.) My brother got the jalapeno burger and it looked yummy and big. In the midst of conversation, I didn't get to ask him how it was, but it didn't look like he had complaints.

She explain her computer is down and she would need to manually assign seat.. Anyway.. after about 10 mins wait and 8 or 9 additional groups of people showed up at the restaurant.. they finally was able to seat us. The server is ok.. but everything takes forever.. we ended up spending 2 hours there for our dinner.  I went there again today for lunch at 1pm... this time, I was immediately seated... but it took about 12 mins for my waitress to come to my table for the very first time (and she didn't even apologize for the delay).. I already have decided what to order while I wait, so I gave her my order.. another 10 mins goes by.. she still did not give me my Water I requested.. I gave up and left the restaurant and went to Tino's next door instead.

The 3 cheeses and bacon with bread crumbs was good, just a little dry. The mushrooms were yummy. The salad and bisque were the highlight of the day. The bisque was creamy and delicious.

The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him.  The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home. Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food.  I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food.  Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross. Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian. Whatever--this place just didn't do it for me.

Yes, I am aware I'm giving this place a 4/5 stars.  I like this particular BJ's mostly because it reminds me of a similar family bar chain based out of Georgia called Taco Mac. I also like this place because of the bartender Joe.  Poor Joe has seen us in there a multitude of times and it kills me that he still has to follow the corporate ""script"" of up selling and whatnot. We know he has to. I worked my way through Chili's for goodness sakes and they'd send out secret shoppers to ensure we were even offering the Presidente Margarita to every effing lunch patron, otherwise we'd be written up.  But I digress.  I've always been there for lunch hours where their beers are on happy hour lunch prices. Joe has always been the bartender and he remembers us and knows my adoration for their Nutty Brewnette, which is a poor man's version of my favoritism beer on the plant, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. He is always accommodating and can suggest the yummiest foods.  Looking for something unique, opt for the bruschetta bites as a tasty palate driver before your meal. Their chicken tortilla soup is the jam with a fabulous presentation. They may go a bit overboard with the cheese, which, let's face it, I'm totally cool with.

So filling that I couldn't finish it. Two come on the plate with diced chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, feta, and a greek yogurt sauce that tasted exactly like sour cream. I thought they were fine without it. It's also served with 'bistro grains'. I couldn't tell if the grain was barley or farro but I did catch the red quinoa, corn, and black beans and thought they went well together. My husband surprised me by ordering off the enlightened menu too, but he got the bison burger that came with slaw and he cleaned his plate. We like to share something on the small bites menu as an appetizer sometimes and tried the fried artichokes today which I thought were just okay. The dipping sauce reminds me of a ranch but more tangy and the artichoke bites themselves could have used more seasoning.  I think the biggest advantage of dining here is their rewards program which gives you points for every dollar you spend that you can redeem later for free food.

Over the holidays, my parents came into town and we made a reservation at BJ's due to its family-friendly atmosphere (we had a 2 year old and 6 month old in our group). Our server appeared to be high and had a lot of trouble getting the order straight with our table. Ok, whatever, this is Austin - as long as the food comes out it will be fine. The appetizers and drinks came out with no issues.  When the food came out, ALL but one order was incorrect. (We had a party of 7). None of the pizzas had sauce OR tomatoes. The one vegan pizza that was ordered was covered in sausage. The two year old's macaroni and cheese took about 40 minutes to come out and his fries never did show up. A manager came by to apologize about the macaroni and cheese taking so long, so we took the opportunity to let her know that all of the food came out with errors. Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue, she argued with us. 'The sauce is baked into the pizza.' We tore the pizza apart to show her, no, there is no sauce and the deep dish pizza promises cooked delicious tomatoes. She then took about 10 minutes and came back with an ice cold cup of ice cold chopped salad tomatoes. Again, never apologizing for our completely ruined dinner. No one but one person was able to eat their dinner in the restaurant. She re-made one of the deep dish pizzas into a thin crust pizza to go and came back and acted like she did us some big favor (even though it was not asked for and was not what was ordered).  I could go on and on, but the unprofessionalism of the manager alone was enough to never bring me back. They took some money off of the bill, but considering that no one was able to eat and our entire evening was completely ruined, they should have waived the entire bill.  I emailed corporate to let them know how things are being run at this location and was sent back a standard form email with a $25 gift voucher attached - even though I will never use it and never ever go back.

When she finally did return & inquired about our order, I said she would get that when we got more sugar & half 'n half for our coffee.

After we finished what we wanted of the dessert, the aloof waitress swept by. without asking if we were through, and took away plates.

He went to his boss and asked, and came back and told me what ""seasonal fruit"" they had, which was melon, grapes, etc. I'm like... that's a weird cobbler? He checked again and it turns out it's always a mixed berry cobbler. There's so much stuff on this menu that they don't even know what they serve! This menu could be cut down by like 90% and they could focus on quality over quantity. Overall, for not that much food for four people and poor quality food at that, we walk out of there with some ridiculous $110+ tab.  We could've gone somewhere decent for that much money! I regret the decision to eat there so much. Long story short, this is McDonalds level with a cruddy facelift. I don't know where these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from at all.

My mother the mahi mahi tacos she was unimpressed. I ordered the house sirlion medium rare... Apparently this is foreign meat to bjs. The ""steak"" was tiny and over cooked and they forgot to load my potato....a nightmare that was just beginning, they took back my meal only to later bring me just a loaded potato...this was my meal. Then came another steak and potato, this time the meat wasn't even a steak more like a dry hamburger patty. Round 3 the meat again was questionable, I cut into it and no juices...plus the meat looked brown.,..meanwhile the potatoes wouldn't stop. At one point my boyfriend had to go find our waiter and beg for the potatoes to just stop coming. The 4th steak at least wasn't over cooked...BUT rare as hell. So i just gave up, enough was enough.

129,Danielle W.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2015-06-19,"Have you ever had a burger that was so good, you called your mom and apologized because the next time you see her, you will have to slap her?  That did not happen at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  I went for lunch with a coworker and it was a celebration for a promotion for me so I was super excited.  I had eaten at the location south before and so I knew what to expect in regards to the menu and service. Well, you don't know what you have until it's gone.   We sit down and wait for about ten minutes to even be greeted by our server.  She did not provide a name.  We were next to a very large table of people, maybe fifteen or twenty in total, but they were not rowdy or noisy at all. They had just finished placing their order when we sat down.  After waiting for a long time, we finally get a server and are able to order our drinks. Five minutes later, we actually get our drinks. We ordered lemonade so you wouldn't think it would take that long but that is neither here nor there.  When she comes back to our table with the drinks, we place our orders. We both order burgers, her's medium and mine mid-rare (I like my meat to fight me when I eat it).  Then we wait. And wait. And wait. The large table gets all their food, they get drink refills, they get asked if everything is alright, they are happy.  We are left waiting like Leo DiCaprio waiting for his Oscar. Finally, food arrives. HAHA NOPE. Not our food, the runner got the wrong table and then asked us if we are sure that that food isn't ours. Yes, we know that we ordered two burgers, not three sandwiches.  After 50 minutes and no sign of the waitress or really anyone, the large table is paying, getting to-go drinks and boxes, and is leaving. We FINALLY get our food. The fries are hot and tasty. Her burger is fine. Mine is like a hockey puck of overcooked sadness. I also asked for ranch for my french fries and I am only assuming that the woman had to go to the elusive Hidden Valleys themselves as she was never seen or heard from again and I never got my ranch. I take a bite of my burger as I am starting to eye my arm with a ravenous gaze at this point but no, I can't eat it. I just can't. Waitress is gone. She finally walks by, attempting to avoid eye contact but I manage to get her attention. We place an order to go for my other coworkers who stayed behind, two burgers with fries. She then realizes that we have no drinks left, we had even drunk the ice that had melted into water. Brings back two drinks and then scurries away.  Never once asked if everything was ok and never gave me a chance to say ""hey, I can't eat this.""  Just runs like Forrest Gump.  After eight minutes, she brings out the to go order. So they CAN cook burgers faster than an hour, they just choose not to. Gives me the check and then FINALLY notices that my burger is sitting there in it's entirety, gently congealing. ""Do you want a to-go box?"" I can't help it, I laugh. Tell her no, I can't eat this now, I won't eat it later. ""Was there something wrong with it?"" Told her that I had ordered mid-rare and this is quite obviously well done, then prove it by picking up the burger and tapping it against the plate, making the clinking sound of WAY overcooked meat.  ""Oh"" and walks away. Never apologized, never asked if I wanted something else. Nothing. No response other than ""oh"". She returns with the check and said that they took the burger off the bill and then walks away again.   I am a grown up. I understand that sometimes, things happen. Sometimes, burgers overcook and nobody notices. Sometimes, its busy and you can't get refills for a table. Sometimes, Mercury is in retrograde and a ninja just killed your pa and you have to work four jobs to support your grieving mother and you get to those jobs walking barefoot, in the snow, uphill both ways.  Ignoring a table and not following up on them is unacceptable. Maybe management needs a more hands on approach. Maybe this entire restaurant needs a sternly worded Come to Jesus talk. Maybe someone will ACTUALLY APOLOGIZE when they are told the food is inedible.

30,Aaris E.,"Pflugerville, TX",2,20,4.0,1.0,2015-10-14,"The evening of Monday, October 12th will mark my final visit to BJ's on Mopac.  I was entertaining a guest from out of town and thought it'd be cool as her home town doesn't have a BJ's.  Boy was I wrong!  We were greeted by the hostess and seated.  A waitress immediately provided us with water and said our waiter would be with us soon.  We were seated in the center of the dining area at a four top table.  Additionally, a waiter literally swept around us.  I mention the location so that you'll know it was impossible not to see us.  10 minutes later we completed reviewing the menu and was ready to order however the waiter never showed.  There were roughly four other parties in the dining area (all of which had waiters).  At 15 minutes in a family of five  were seated.  My friend finally became frustrated and left the restaurant stating how ridiculous the service was.  I stayed behind because I wanted to see just how long this fiasco could go on.    At 20 minutes in as a waiter served the family of five sodas I decided it was time to speak with a manager.  I explained to the manager that we had basically been ignored.  He stated he was certain it was not the case;  that perhaps we were overlooked.  I then walked him over to the highly visible area where we previously sat.  He apologized and offered courtesy meal cards as he saw it was impossible not to have seen us.  As he went back to the kitchen for the courtesy cards he was visibly upset with his staff.  I saw him admonish staff and could almost imagine what he was saying by the hand gestures he used.  As soon as he went into the kitchen the staff (a group of four or greater) literally began laughing at him.  When he returned I told him I what I witnessed.  What I didn't tell him was that this was not my first, but second HORRIBLE experience at the Mopac BJ's.  Because BJ's has good food, nice atmosphere and an extensive beer/wine menu I'll continue to patronize it however I will NEVER go the Mopac location.

But this is the second time that BJ's has taken away my favorite dish with no notice! But I know I can't expect a chain food place to keep something that they don't want to, so I digress.  Once I realized that I would have to order something else I decided to try my boyfriend's favorite dish, the fish tacos. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the tortillas that the tacos were served in were disgustingly stale. I took one bite out of them and my teeth hurt stale. I would have told my server this and requested fresh ones or something else, but no one ever check on us after dropping off the food. Granted, our server had a large table that was nearby, but we never even received an ""Everything tasting ok?"" walk by. A manager even came by and talked with the large table near us, but never stopped to talk with us.

There's a full bar and a lot of options so you can't really go wrong! I'm usually drawn to ordering the fish & chips - the wedge fries are to die for, and I like the tartar sauce a lot.

I think everything on the menu is decent - nothing amazing but you can't really go wrong. Price is a little high for what you get in my opinion, but there are generally large portions.

I was a little bummed when I found out that St. Arnold's Brewery in Houston would brew their beers. It wasn't until I spoke to one of their brewers at Denver's Great American Beer Festival that I found out why.

Too big, really.  I was trying to decide between a burger, pasta, pizza or a steak.  Everything looked delicious.   They were out of the pumpkin beer, so my husband tried the Hopstorm IPA.  He also tried the Piranha IPA.  The Piranha was much better, much more hoppy. Their peach margarita was good.  The glass was full of ice which is why I probably don't drink much when we go out - I always feel I'm not getting my money's worth.  I loved the flavor and the peaches at the bottom of the glass but I should remember to stick to blended drinks.  I switched to a mug of their BJ's Root Beer and that was excellent. Frosty, cold mug...yum.  I'd buy that to bring home if I could.   The hickory brisket and bacon burger was excellent.

Each time we visit the Austin area, we head over to the closest location to make sure we do at least one round of BJ's before heading home.   The chain is in the same vein as Granite City, where you have a nice, slightly upscale bar-and-grill approach to the dining room. The food is uber-solid for the genre, and the beer here is super easy to drink across the entire line.  No matter your preference, you'll find a very approachable brew with your name on it.   This time around, I went for the whiskey barrel aged porter, and was not disappointed.  Is it A+ beer?  Negative.  However, it's a solid, passable B all day long, and that's pretty good for a chain bar and grill. I've tried a good swath of the food on the menu as well.  Among my favorites is the pizza. But, the thing that will keep you coming back is the Pizookie.  Goofy in name but dead-serious in flavor, this has to be one of my favorite desserts, anywhere.  It's a fresh-baked cookie, served oven-warm in a micro-dish with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of sauce on top. There are multiple flavors to choose from, and all are killer.   On my last visit, our waitress, Ms. Marlie, enticed me with a bit of a tease about a Pizookie Platter, which she mentioned is like having five full-size Pizookies.  It's now on the bucket list. Over three trips to Austin, I've been to one BJ's or another six times.  Frequency alone ought to speak volumes, especially in a land of incredible food trucks and barbecue. I really can't figure out why almost every location of this franchise is rated 3 stars on Yelp.  You people must not have been to your local Crapplebees or Chili's lately!

When it came time for the check she had passed me several times, never checked on me to ask me how my meal was, never refilled my water glass, (thank God). A manager finally walked by and asked me how everything was and of course I mentioned I need my check and a box for my food. The manager delivered my check and brought me a box. I put my debit card in the check presenter, she ran my debit card, brought me back the check and didn't say a word. She then turned to the table next to me and told the family of four ""I hope you have a great night, it was my pleasure and I hope to see you again soon"".  Made me feel like I wasn't even there.

This trip did not disappoint us at all.  We left happy and satisfied with our visit. For our drinks, my husband ordered a pint of the Grand Cru, a holiday Craft Beer.  He was not a big fan, but I loved it!  I ordered the the BJ's Irish Rootbeer, which includes hand crafted root beer, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Baileys Irish Cream, and Butterscotch schnapps.  This was absolutely delicious, the only change I would make is a bit more whiskey and schnapps.  I tasted everything else but these two ingredients and both should have been noticeable in the drink if the correct amount was added.  For our meal, my husband ordered the Derby-Style Chicken Cobb salad.  He absolutely adored it.  This is December, and the freshness and quality of the vegetables were amazingly on point. The avocado tasted of a freshly picked one from Summer time, no bruises on it at all.  He loved this salad and ate it all up. I ordered the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp entree.   I am normally not a huge tomato based food kind of fan - heartburn and all....but this dish was sooo delicious and fresh - I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The mahi mahi was super fresh and this fish is just like a steak of the seas- very meaty and hearty.  The flavors were so well blended. The shrimp was spot on delicious. The dish had a saltiness but not salty - more like a briney flavor that hits your taste buds and makes them tingle with happiness.  Of course I had to keep pushing my husbands fork away at his attempts to steal my food lol.  The only suggestion I would have is a few more shrimp, but it was the standard amount - especially for the price which was fairly decent considering the quality and quantity of the dish.

370,Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,668,,4.0,2017-02-02,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse gets no love in Austin. Some Yelpers hate it. The parking lot is deserted. In contrast, BJ's is THE place to be in College Station. The place is always packed. You park far away and walk in. The two establishments are near clones of each other - so the question is not good vs bad establishments in a chain. It is Austin vs Aggie World View. * On this particular question - I have to side with the Aggies. BJ's is a fine establishment. It is not perfect.  It is an eating establishment - and not a drinking establishment. Their homemade beers generally are awful.  (I recently ordered a Jeremiah Red, took two sips of it and sent it back to the bartender. Tasteless on first mouth contact - but with a bad aftertaste.  Talk about a bad combination of attributes.) Their selection of other beers and hard liquors is good but not magnificent. In Austin, which has the best funky bars of any city in a 1000 mile radius .... There are simply too many other awesome places near by for BJ's to be able to compete. In Bryan/College Station, BJ's stock runs higher from weaker competition. * But bar by bar comparisons miss the big picture here. BJ's has three gigantic points in its favor. 1) The room is beautiful. 2) The food is excellent. 3) For Chili's-style American places, BJ's has one of the healthiest menus around.  Good eye candy, good taste and a note from my doctor. With that combination, sign me up. * The room.  The architectural style is deliberately 1930's retro with better lighting.  This is particularly noticeable in the bathrooms - which are some of the best ever for a chain restaurant. But it applies throughout the establishment. Wainscoting. Frosted glass doors with old-style lettering. Brass accents. Walking in here feels like you are entering Sardi's or the Algonquin Hotel lunchroom. I am always happy when I arrive at a BJ's. * The food. BJ's runs a standard American chain bar and grill menu with more light items and more vegetables. You want quinoa? They got quinoa. They have many veggie sides and not just a few. They always have five or six different soups ranging from light and not caloric to loaded with the works.  And yeah -  they got burgers - lots of burgers - and wings and ribs and all the fun stuff we love, for when you need more than a portobello mushroom to keep you happy. Execution is excellent both on healthy stuff and fun stuff. I have been eating at BJ's (although not the Austin one) for years and have yet to get a bad dish. When I made my test run of the North Mopac BJ's, I intentionally ordered dishes I have had at the College Station BJ's. The preparation and final product were the same in both places - which meant I was quite happy with my food. * Now people have told me that they have had bad experiences at BJ's. Maybe there is a new manager now - and the old manager was terrible. Maybe I know too many fussy eaters -  although I doubt that since I hang with the most magnificent people in the universe. But the BJ's on North Mopac seems perfectly fine. For my money, BJ's is at the top of the chain American bar-and-grill establishment - and is still respectable when you add indie bar and grills into the comparison pool. Yeah, it is not better than the best of the best -  but it is as good if not better than much of the pack. Just don't drink their homemade beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2,2.96,3.02,3.064,3.2800000000000002,2.9960000000000004

I would have given 5 stars, but today was not the case. My family and I arrived and were seated promptly with no problems, as it was not very full. There were 5 servers at the door. However, after waiting 13 minutes, I put a 2 minute timer on, because I wasn't going to wait longer than 15 minutes. With the countdown on, we finally got a server. He didn't wait on us because of the timer, he saw from across the restaurant that we hadn't been served. He came over took our orders and we received our drinks as fast as he could. After he walked away, the manager came over and offered his apologies. We were calm, and the rest of our meal and service was actually quite enjoyable. We offered a thank you for his service to Nathan...our server...and out of his own mouth, he said he just didn't want anyone to leave displeased with their experience. So BJ's, this is a good employee to keep. He was fast, pleasant, and made the children's dining experience a good one. The food was good and no issues except the afore mentioned mishap.

The big draw was that have their own beers.....so I was down for trying some new brews. The menu is extensive and it's pretty hard to choose! (Hey! That rhymed!) Lots of heavier fare that are calorie-laden but they also have lighter choices. I opted for the thin crust pizza with pineapple and jalapeño. The thin crust version is new to the menu and there are only a few choices - one was with bacon,ham, pineapple and jalapeño...I just asked to hold the meat on that one. Came out light, crispy, savory and a little sweet/tart/hot with the pineapple and jalapeño. We started by sharing the brussels sprouts - served crispy with a creamy sriracha sauce. Yum. My dining companions had the loaded burger and the chicken parmesan. Fries are really good. (I stole several). Dark beers all around - I had the bourbon barrel stout...delicious and strong. Nope...wasn't driving. Yep - had two. Almost forgot about the dessert! Maybe it's because I was in a beer/food-coma after this meal. We ordered 3 ""mini"" pizookies (get it? pizza and cookie makes a new word...): 1 monkey bread, one triple chocolate and one salted caramel. All were super sweet, decadent and....like I said...coma inducing. High calorie treat for sure but if you're going for it...go for it. They have ""regular"" sized pizookies as well.  The restaurant is clean, large, loud and the food was good. Would definitely go to BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2,3.92,3.32,3.144,,3.56

While the seasoning on the food are usually on the salty side for me, I still think they are pretty tasty. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the experiences I had this past week.  They sometimes have really good deal on the weekdays, but the waitress did not inform us the extra charge on some of sides while ordering the deal of the day, and of course I wasn't aware of it till I got the receipt. The other time I was charged extra for one of the sides. Kudos to the manager, the first time I called and complained about the issue, I was well taken care off immediately.

I even asked to make sure it wasn't a mini. I was assured it was a normal sized pizookie.  When I got home, I was disappointed. Since it was only $3 per pizookie, it didn't feel bad but I was upset since I was expecting something good. The cookie barely even filled up half of the plate, and I definitely didn't receive more than one scoop of ice cream. Maybe two small scoops.  Again, I think it was probably because I had takeout, and the special promo. They need to cut corners somewhere to still get some money at the end of the day.
