96,Monica C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,17,,3.0,2015-08-24,"Started off on a bad foot with the hostess staff.  There is a stupid revolving door that lets into a rather small waiting area.  On a Monday night, it was standing room only at the front door, so had to make two revolutions in the revolving door before there was room to step inside.  Waited in a line 4-deep to check in.  Asked for a table for 2, but she did not ask for our name, just said ""Ok, we'll seat you in a few minutes""  Another hostess who takes you to your seats only announces ""Table for 2?""  or ""Table for 4?"" etc.  It's left up to your fellow patrons to determine who was there first.  We waited to the side of the hostess stand for 5 minutes or so.  While we're waiting, another party of 2 walks in the door, checks in at the hostess stand, and she said ""Right this way"" to them.  At that point we had to throw a small tantrum that we were obviously there before they were and were still waiting to be seated.  The hostess looked at us perplexed and asked what our name was?  We told her we were never asked for our name.  Still looking perplexed, she told another hostess to seat us, but never did apologize for the screw-up.  They really need to improve on their process at the front door. While we were waiting, we noticed another party of 3 that had to question the hostess why they hadn't been seated yet.  No one wants to start their dinner pissed off. The food is good.  The service is hit or miss.  Thankfully, when other waiters notice your drinks are empty, they'll get you another, just in case your waiter is a dud. A plus is free refills on their in-house root beer/cream sodas, which are delicious. I felt rushed by our waiter - he brought the check before we finished eating, and he took the signed receipt w/tip from me before we left. Reluctantly, I signed up for their rewards program, only because I now know you can get 20% off with mobile pay and ""preferred seating"".  But because I only like them for their food and nothing else, I'll probably do carry-out from now on. *Update*.  Been here a few more times since original post and all is good now.  I still love the food, and wait staff have been great.  They offer some good discounts through their rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2?start=80,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

Seated in the middle of the busy restaurant, and treated to 10 min of very loud grinding from the bar blender that deafened everyone in the place. Couldn't they do this in the kitchen?  Our server brought our drinks but left us for 14 min before taking our order. We asked if they could make a kids meal out of mozzarella sticks, and she said flat-out NO. We pushed it gently, so she left us ""to go ask"". A very long time later, she reappeared to say ""we absolutely can not do that for you"". I am not exaggerating. That is a quote. So we ordered a full $8.99 order of mozzarella sticks for our 7 yr old daughter. She took one bite and left them. We tried them too. They had the taste and texture of fried Playdoh. These were bad, And I'm not picky about my sticks. I even eat the ones at McDonalds. My husband's chicken fried steak had undetectable breading on it, and tasted dry and tough like a beaten-down over-cooked  bad burger. His mixed veggies looked naked like they were dumped out of a frozen bag. My California chicken club was bland and boring... How can you make bacon with no flavor? The ""sourdough"" bread was just greasy white bread. The ""crispy"" thin fries were soaked with grease and anything but crispy (chewy!). And the heap of soggy sticks featured random dark crunchy lumps of something unrecognizable left in the fryer. Bonus!  The only thing I liked was the crispy fried artichokes. They were a delicious combo of soft, tangy goodness inside and flavorful crunchy breading outside. I should have only ordered those. Too bad I won't be back.

I declined to order another dish as this was not the first time they had disappointed.  The other diners (we had 3 adults, 3 teens and one young person) were satisfied with their food but, said they wouldn't put it on a list of ""must go to"" for a great dining experience.  They said the food was average and something you could get at any brew pub.  They did try to order dessert but, I put a stop to that as I've made that mistake before.  I had their ""monkey bread"" once and it was hard and so cold it didn't even melt the ice cream.  I was fortunate that I left with all my teeth intact after trying that once.  Definitely not going to give them another try...wish I hadn't this time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9160000000000004,3.3200000000000003

26,Patricia R.,"Indianapolis, IN",44,7,1.0,1.0,2016-07-31,"I wanted to take my 2 sisters out for their birthday dinner, and the agreement was on BJ's. First we were told it would be a 50 min wait for our party of 6, so we waited in the heat outside, as there was no room inside in the cool. I went in at 50 minutes to ask how much longer would it be to sit our party, and the hostess told me we were the next large party to be seated, and they were waiting to have a place to seat my nephew who only needed a booster seat not a high chair.  I went outside and told my family and we all went directly inside to get out of the heat. We sat and waited another 20 minutes, listening to parties of 2-5 being called verbally out loud continue to be seated.  Finally my sister saw the text that was sent 8 minutes before while other parties names were be said, but yet our name never was. I shared with the hostess, whom I already inquired about the wait, who was only 3 feet from me during the additional 20 minutes we had waited inside, yet failed to call our party name out loud. She went and talked with the next set of workers who seat patrons, about this yet no one talked to me. A manager came up and talks with the group of employees and was overheard saying, ""Did someone tell them,"" looking  slightly in my direction. I then said, ""No, no one has talked to us or apologized.""  At this time a party of 8 came In and stated that they had waited over an hour and wanted to know how much longer. He was told he was texted an hour prior and he showed his phone showing no such text happened. My party was becoming more agitated as it was now 1 1/2 hours wait, a hungry and antsy 3 year old, a diabetic husband who needed to eat, and hot and frustrated family members. One manager tried to rectify the situation in an apology that wasn't even worth her speaking and wasting her breath and my time and intelligence,  as in the end I felt somehow it was my fault for this error.  Another manager came to seat us and apologies again were said but more hear felt this time. As we passed the other workers that were around and the first manager, my sister felt the manager rolled her eyes at her.  Later she saw the two mangers talking, one glancing at my sister and laughed. My sister shared this with the nicer of the two managers of what she just witnessed between the two managers. The other large table who had nonchalantly been blown off too, sat next to us. Both of us were given complementary luke warm mozzarella sticks as an apology. I would think that if anything, an appetizer of our choice would have been a little more intelligent, as only 1/2 our party would eat the deep fried not so warm sticks, mainly out of the need for something in their system. Our waitress did well trying to recover from our ill feelings of what all occurred, that she had nothing to do with. After spending $125 on mediocre dinner and drinks at best, I saw that no compensation was taken off of our bill, we generously tipped our waitress as we knew none of this experience was her fault, we left this restaurant with such a bad taste in our mouth.

Who knows, I tend to avoid places when they've just opened so maybe it was more rough back then. This has become our go-to chain restaurant date spot, that's a thing, right? It is very close to our house and has generous hours so we've been able to have late dinners here when we're busy and not feel like an inconvenience with the servers. In fact, that might be one of the reasons I like it so much - we've had excellent servers, every time. Patient, attentive and helpful.  The food has also always impressed! I have a had a few different things here and it's been generous size portions and great flavor. Good club sandwich, good pizza and good fries, basically my three favorite foods, haha. The menu is quite large which is kinda random and made me worried that it would all be mediocre but hasn't let me down yet!  But let's talk about the real gem on the food menu - the pizookies. They are those big cookies baked into a circle pan that comes topped with ice cream and other delicious additions. Goodness, they are amazing. They aren't burnt to a pan like other competitors, they aren't a blah flavor, they are a pan of delight. I have tried a few flavors and they are all great - the monkey bread one is a bit different and kinda tastes like Cinnabon!  Another really cool thing about BJ's is they have a rewards program and send lots of coupons! Think free apps and discounts on entrees - yes please! Their beer and hand crafted sodas are excecllent - overall, this place has not let me down yet, yes, I just said that about a chain restaurant.

Yes I like the ample parking, quick seating, friendly and efficient service, managers coming to each table to check if you need anything, the vast selection of dishes and drinks and the reasonable prices along with the sizable portions of food.  But let me address my lunch favorite... pick 2... for less than 10 bucks you can get an infinite combination of food items. My go to is the California Flatbread with the tomato mozzarella salad. OMG... that salad alone is what makes me come back. It is visually stunning. Looks small, all the salad hovers in one corner while zigzag lines of the most delicious balsamic decorate the remainder of the plate. As you fork your salad you need to drag it through the balsamic to get the full flavor. If you like nice ripe tomatoes, marble-sized fresh mozzarella balls and a nice light dressing... well then you just simply have to try this.  The California chicken flatbread is also light, crisp and delicious. Chicken, avocado on the thinnest flatbread you can imagine... wonderful. Of course I tend to mess up my healthy lunch by topping it off with one of their mini pizzookies. Salted caramel is my downfall. Yummy cookie topped with ice cream and caramel drizzle... I mean, really, who could resist?  Also I would like to encourage folks to donate a few dollars to their beer for heroes program. You can buy a teacher a beer (as they are vastly underpaid in my opinion).

52,Chrissy C.,"Carmel, IN",145,218,2666.0,5.0,2017-07-28,"BJ's is one of the main places I eat. I love it there. I am in Avon 3-4 days a week with my Aunt and she loves it there. It's just so nice to go and they have so many options. They have daily specials. And an app. Get the app for sure. You earn points and the coupons are in the app. You can also pay with the app. I usually don't though. I eat here at least twice a week. My aunt can no longer drive and we go to the movie in Avon and this location is perfect for us. The food is always good. The staff is wonderful. I mean super WONDERFUL! Like I love them. They treat my aunt so well. They laugh at all her stories even though she has told them 3-4 times that same lunch. We usually get there at off time, before or after a lunch or dinner rush. We often get the same table, which my aunt loves. Consistency is key for her.  Mondays is half price pizza. I get her that every few weeks and then she has some to take home. Wednesdays is $10 burgers with unlimited fries. The Portobello burger is my favorite! The pesto is amazing on it. The Portobello as big as the burger. Thursdays is ribs and it comes with 3 sides. My aunt loves the chicken tortilla soup and I love the new lentil soup. Monday-Friday during lunch you can get unlimited soup and salad for around $10. The caprese salad is amazing!  Anyone on Thursdays the ribs also come with a  free mini pizookie. They are wonderful! I love the mini size! And Fridays and Sunday they have been doing prime rib, which she also loves.  The menu has a ton of healthy choices! The salmon quinoa bowl is my go to. I also like the lemon thyme chicken.  They also now have small plates, all veggies, but yum. It's like every time I go they have something even better! I honestly never get tired of eating there. Sometimes my aunt does, but every time we go to MCL instead we spend just as much if not more on mediocre food. And with so many options I can keep it fresh and I always know the food will be good and the service is always wonderful. I know they can be busier on the weekends, but we still get great service. We just know the staff during the week better. As soon as they see us coming they have my Aunt's Diet Pepsi ready to go for her.   Using the coupons and earning points keeps us coming back as well. I don't check in every time we go. I am sure it's closer to 60 times this year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92

Atmosphere is great, decor is great, service is better than average. If you having trouble making a decision then this is a good place because they have so many different types of food.

I think that best sums up my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
42,Danielle S.,"Indianapolis, IN",153,58,57.0,5.0,2017-09-06,"The Avon location at BJ's brewhouse has surprised me by being a consistently decent restaurant to get a nice dinner for the past couple of years--something to be said for a chain location. I've been here quite a few times with different friends and always had great service and my food has always been really good to great.  From the minute you walk in, a hostess will greet you with a smile. I have never been to this place when Rockville Road is really busy. So I can't speak for Friday night, or game night crowds and how the service might change when they are busy. On weeknights and we can lunch times when I've been here, the servers are great. My last visit specifically, the server mentioned she had been there five years. I was eating lunch with my mother-in-law, and she was able to ask about certain menu items and the waitress was very knowledgeable about ingredients that were in them.  It's always nice to feel like you're getting an honest opinion and real answers to your questions, rather than getting sold on the most expensive menu items on the menu for the sake of a bigger tip.  Our waitress was also very good about bringing water and offering refills. She offered to bring to go cups when she brought our bill as well. A nice touch.  As far as the menu, BJ's brewhouse can be overwhelming. This is where having a knowledgeable waitress really comes in handy. The menu is as large as a small book, at least 10 pages. My favorite is the pizza, deep dish of course. They also have a decent veggieburger, but it's a little spicy. Their french fries are amazing. The only thing I've ever eaten here that I've not been super impressed with is the salad. The salads are average--made with bagged ingredients, more as an afterthought for the menu. On one occasion, I met with friends and we had drinks. As a brewhouse the bartenders do you know what they're doing. I do not like beer, so I can't speak to those menu items. But some of the mixed drinks specials I've tried (at this location and at Greenwood) are really good.  The only negative I can think of for someone might be the fact that the restaurant can get loud, but it is a brewhouse, with high ceilings and a lot of TVs. So if you walk in and see this, you should probably set your expectations to this. If you go there and hope to have a quiet conversation, my ask for a booth in the corner or at the side of the restaurant, where it tends to be a little more quiet.  I would eat here more often if I lived closer. My next planned trip is to try to make it in on a Monday. I read on the menu that it's half-price pizza and Margarita night. And I think I mentioned before that their deep dish pizza is amazing. If you don't come here for anything else, you have to try the pizza! They do usually have a special if you check in on Yelp! Also, they have take-out and an App in the Apple Store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,3.96,3.96,3.96,,3.96
2,Karina S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2,15,17.0,2.0,2017-09-10,Went here on a Saturday night. It's looks pretty posh. So we dressed the part.  Unfortunately the food wasn't worth it... the avocado egg rolls didn't look like the photo in the menu as they were overcooked and the avocado was turning brown. We will only be back for beer as the food was average but over-priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2?start=20,3.96,3.58,3.58,,3.732
41,Wanda M.,"Indianapolis, IN",465,716,5598.0,4.0,2017-09-25,"BJ's is another of the new brewhouses popping up throughout the Indy area in Avon on Rockville Road. Our first experience, week one,  wasn't a very postive experience but the Manager, Desmond, went above and beyond to correct the various situations. The bar area is first come seating so we opted for a tall top in the bar area. The highlights were a 20 minute wait for our server, slow service even after identifying server, food allergy wasn't adhered to either by the waitress or kitchen, appetizer came out with entree,  entree delivered not as ordered and returned only to be returned with the allergy ingredient. By now we had decided to write BJ's off our rotation. However the food was good after correcting the order and Desmond worked hard to correct the problems. I'm happy to say since then we've had many uneventful visits. Now after months we seem to encounter either appetizers coming out with meal or one item overcooked or allergy item appears. It's been hit or miss. However, when the order is correct we really enjoy the food. Hence, we continue to go back. BJ Oasis Amber is excellent and one of my husbands favorite. Similar to October Fest, less hoppy and a little spicer. There are 10 house beers on tap, 4 seasonal house beers, 28 bottled beers and a full bar. The Bloody Mary has a tasty, smokey mix and nice for brunch. Growlers are also available. The menu is enormous with 6 pages of beers, wine, and cocktails alone. A large variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees make it easy to select someone for most everyone's taste buds. We enjoy their lunch menu and I particularly enjoy their personal size pizza and salad. The Chicken Wings are tasty and drizzled in hot & spicy buffalo sauce.   The North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp is light with fresh ingredients. The Mahi is oven roasted seasoned with their own Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, with sauteed shrimp, red onions, tomatoes, Kalakaua olives with spicy garlic then served over couscous. One of my favorites. My husband enjoys the BBQ Pulled pork sandwich with their own BJ's Peppered BBQ sauce then topped with crispy onion strings served with crispy-thin French Fries. My go-to entree is the Roasted Chicken & Spinach Quinoa Bowl with roasted chicken seasoned again with their Big Popper's Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, sautéed red onions, mushrooms, spinach and seasoned tomatoes served over quinoa. Always good and I love all the veggies.  The Managers have worked hard to correct issues and they continue to say ""They can't correct what they don't know about"" so speak up if your unhappy. On the flip side of the coin, let them know when your meal was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,4.08,3.57,3.57,,3.774

51,Trisha H.,"Plainfield, IN",21,95,33.0,5.0,2017-10-18,I had not been to a BJ's in years but went a few nights ago with my sister. We got a flatbread pizza and two of the $3 pizookies. It was an AMAZING late-night dinner! I was impressed by the size of the menu here. The Avon location is still new-feeling - very clean and modern. The service was great! It looked like they had a decent selection of on-tap beers and a large cocktail menu. I was expecting a cliche chain bar/restaurant but I ended up having a great time!

40,Joey S.,"Hamilton, OH",10,134,208.0,4.0,2017-10-24,"Stopped in here for a late dinner one night with a friend.  Normally I don't eat at too many chain restaurants if I can help it, but as it was getting late and my friend really enjoys this place (and the Mexican place next to it.)  I figured why not.   I ordered the Chicken Pita Taco's, which surprised me by being very good considering it was a chain restaurant. Service was very good as well the young man that waited on us was attentive, but not hovering (he had several tables, and did a nice job of just checking in and filling water glasses as needed; we didn't even have to ask) For dessert (yep I love desserts) I order the small monkey bread pizookie.  It was okay, not amazing, basically just monkey pull apart bread with ice cream on top.   If and when I go back I will try the BJ'S Baked Beignet as it at least appears to even look yummy on a menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,4.24,3.59,3.59,,3.85

50,Justin C.,"Indianapolis, IN",24,168,28.0,4.0,2017-12-13,"The BJ's in Avon rests where the TGI Friday's used to be in front of the Target shopping center on restaurant row and is part of the brewhouse concept a'la Rock Bottom, Ram, Granite City and so on. The menu is pretty gigantic with something for everyone and it even includes an Enlightened section for people trying to watch their calories. The choices on the kids menu are pretty wide as well. The beer selection is pretty vast, as one would expect, and also covers the spectrum. I'd say the theme of BJ's is having things covered for everybody. My experience at this location was pleasant. The dining room and restrooms were all clean along with a friendly and knowledgeable staff. I opted for one of their house IPAs and was very satisfied with it. My sirloin was very tasty and a good portion for the price. My only issue is that the entrees did not look very much like they were pictured in the menu when they arrived at the table. Prices are just below the ""pricey"" side and I would say it is an average value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,4.28,3.6,3.6,,3.8720000000000003

46,Sankofa T.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,2.0,2018-01-02,"Allow me to preface that I am NOT a disgruntled customer. Nobody treated me badly, the service was cool, and the food was warm. I am giving an objective, unbiased review. I went to this restaurant with my girl, to go somewhere of which we didn't have any knowledge. Simple review Pros - 1) Authentic house made menu. Their fruit drinks are really fruit drinks. (Didn't care for it as much, but...) 2) Good service. It wasn't outstanding, but the normal good service. Good. 3) The cookies n cream piezookie was AMAZING!!! Cons -  1) They didn't have any complimentary bread, which I feel is the standard for a good restaurant. 2) The food was just, well, bad. We had their steak, which was bland, and their jambalaya, which was waaaay too seasoned. Also, we had their mac n cheese couscous, which was okay in my opinion, but my girl thought it tasted like play-do. (I understand why she said that) 3) The prices were on the high side, not because it broke the bank, but in relation to what you can get at a Cheddar's, Texas Roadhouse, or some other restaurant, which all are better options in taste and quanity, is too expensive. In summary, it would be a one star if it wasn't for that cookie. That cookie salvaged the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,4.2,3.61,3.61,,3.846
48,Asia A.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,12,3.0,3.0,2018-01-06,"With BJ's being a chain restaurant, I'm used to a certain standard of food when I go. Unfortunately, when I arrived at 9 pm, the food delivered to the table for my guest and I was quite cold. Instead of replacing the order, since the waitress didn't return for about 20 minutes, I was satisfied with quietly departing, and receiving a refund. All in all, I will continue to visit this restaurant because I love the large variety of food choices, the desserts, and the decor of this restaurant. This was maybe just a one off, not so great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-avon-2,4.12,3.61,3.61,,3.814
