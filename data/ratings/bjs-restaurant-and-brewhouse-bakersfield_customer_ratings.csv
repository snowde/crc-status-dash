369,Amber B.,"Bakersfield, CA",18,93,3.0,4.0,2012-01-15,"So my husband and I have been here twice now.  So far we like it!  The food has been consistant both times.  The atmosphere is great.  It has a pretty big bar area. You can dress up a bit if you really wanted or show up in a hoodie and still fit in.  We went about 5pm and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  soon after we were seated, the place filled up fast.  Service was pretty good on our first trip.  The waitress gave us some recommendations, which my father in law followed, and he wasn't dissapointed.  He ordered the fish and chips.  I ordered the fish tacos.  I thought that they were awesome! They came with guac and salsa (which were good) and maybe 5 chips.  I do wish that they came with more chips. My husband ordered the crispy jalapeno burger.  It was huge!  He loved it. It had deep fired jalapenos on it which he said added a wonderful touch.  We all ordered their beers and we were all happy with them.  I ordered the brunette, which so far is my fave ( I do like darker beers the most).  My husbands fave is the pale ale.  The second trip , I ordered the angel hair pasta. It was very yummy.  The serving size was huge.  pasta was cooked perfectly.  The flavors were very subtle.  My husband ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp.  he really liked it, but thought it could be spicier.  he thought the burger was better. service wasn't as great this trip.  We sat at the table for a few minutes and then another family was seated later.  The waitress saw them first even though we had already been waiting.  It was apparent that she forgot about us a few times.  She would wait on her other tables, walk away, then literally do an about face and come to our table, like ""Oh yeah I forgot about these two"".  We waited for awhie to get our check and then awhile longer for her to come back for the credit card.   My only reason for not giving them a 5 star is because on the first trip i asked for my tacos without onions, and they still put the onions on, and the second trip I ordered chicken in my pasta and they forgot to put it in, so I had to wait for it.  The food was good though, regardless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.056,3.1200000000000006

But when you get a female server it just goes downhill from there.  The girls are rude, don't refill your drinks, and stand around talking about their favorite t.v shows.  I don't mind that they takes breaks and all, I'm for that but when you see them talking in circles and repeatedly passing your table while we're down to the ice c'mon.  Again, the male servers are great you can see them hustle, but once you sit down and you get Buffy the vampire slayer, just get up and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=240,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.6600000000000006,3.1200000000000006

If you want real gourmet pizza, try Pizza Antica (it costs about the same).  What I do like is the ahi poke and tomato bisque soup. Service is also good.

My associate ordered the veggie burger only to be informed that they are no longer serving it. After what had to have been 30 minutes we were served  mozzarella sticks which were essentially lightly breaded sticks of string cheese. They were OK.

AMAZINGLY good and huge! They made up for the trouble and the bad steak.

There pyzookie cookie dessert was the best part.... guess thats their only real claim to fame. The service was a bit weird.

But the atmosphere here isnt so appealing that it can justify the restaurant charging mid-scale prices for such low-brow food.

The entree also came with 2 pieces of toast, covered with some cheese crumbs.

I was told over the phone it would be a 1hr wait but when i showed up it got bumped up to a 2 hour wait. After about 30 mins there were a lot of free tables and still no buzz so we decided to sit ourselves. 15 mins later we get a waiter saying he'll sit us in a bigger table shortly. So we finally get seated and this is about 1 hour after we arrive. A hostess comes up to our table, doesn't say a word and starts handing each of us a menu. Finally she says ""your waitress will be with you shortly"" as she walks away...  We then meet our waitress who has permanent BITCH FACE. She takes our drink order and 1 dinner order. She disappears for about 30 mins. I even suggested to just skip out on our bill and leave because of the crappy service but we decided to stay. My friend decides to tell a waiter that she hasn't came back. That waiter comes back with our drinks. BITCH face finally decides to come back and take the rest of our dinner orders. 45 mins later we start to get our food. We all got our food except my friend who ordered her dinner WAY back when we ordered our first round of drinks. She tells the waitress that she didn't receive her food  and the waitress calls out the wrong order. My friend had to remind her of what she ordered. She doesn't admit to not punching in her order but we all knew she did. At this point we're pissed. She comes back with a super hot plate which mostly likely means it got either A. Microwaved or B. thrown in the oven to reheat it. The noodles where as good as a 25 cent pack of Ramon noodles. Completely tasteless. My friend had to ask a random waiter for a bottle of Tapatillo sauce because our ""waitress"" had gone on break. He doesn't come back w/tapatillo but he did have a chalula bottle. Everyone leaves more than half of their dinner because it was downright shitty. I didn't even want desert because the whole experience was just plain SHIT.

At first the waitress seemed on the ball, but that quickly faded. We had to ask for all of our refills. My brother ordered a pan pizza and they brought out one that clearly was not pan crust. He asked about it and inquired as to whether or not they simply changed their recipe. He was told that the oven wasn't working so they didn't have pan pizzas. Clearly this is something he should have been told when he ordered. He kept the pizza since he was hungry. After biting into it he realized there was no pizza sauce. Seriously, no sauce on a pizza??? I had the creole tilapia. The fish and rice were good. My only complaint was that my salad had no dressing. The menu said it had a vinegarette and the waitress also mentioned this, yet there was none. Overall it was a bad experience. Honestly I can't think of a good experience I've really had here.

I ended up getting 2 pitchers and few appetizers. Some of the appetizers we got were California Club Flatbread pizza, Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps, and Avocado Egg roll. The California Club flatbread pizza was ok, it was not that great.  Not to much flavor and the taste was kind of bland. The Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps was actually delicious.  It had cajun style shrimp and it was kind of spicy.  The lettuce makes it even more great with the sauce on top.  The Avocado Egg roll was not bad at all too.  The avocado and egg together wrapped made it great.  The sauce that compliments the avocado egg roll is the best. The waiter was great and always attended to us to see how we were doing.

They were perfectly filled with just the right amount of everything in them. I just wish they would come with more in one order for about ten dollars you only get 3 egg rolls, they are cut up in halves so it looks like more but it's not. I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. You have the choice of grilled chicken or blackened chicken. I chose to go for the blackened one.....bad idea. The chicken just tasted like it was seasoned with chili powder and paprika, it was not charred more as I was expecting. Overall it just didn't go with Alfredo and pasta, I recommend going with just the grilled chicken. We also ordered steak and a huge baked potato both were just as tasty, but that potato was reallllly good. And lastly we ordered a small Mediterranean pizza, super loaded with a bunch of toppings I may not know the names of but it was good. I think it would have been better without all thirty pepperoncinis sprinkled on top.

Drinks don't get refilled, your food takes forever, no one checks up on you to see if you need anything. Also, they wont split a tab more than four ways if you have a group of 8 or more, which gets frustrating when you have a large group and everyone is paying separately, but I'm not knocking them for that.

Since then I've tried several different dishes. The chicken parmigiani was amazing! It was so good that I ordered it again a few weeks later, but for take-out.

Server noted the baked potato came with soup or salad but I could get a cup of chili instead. Glad that was an option, (because after being served a muddy salad last visit I was reluctant to even return) but then They served the potato and though it was enough to fill the gullet it's presentation was strange to me. I get the distinct feeling our location was bought out by someone new and the owner either hired a slew of angry cooks or the owner has no idea what's going on.

As for the food, for the appetizer I like the Santa Fe Rolls and the mozzarella sticks, but I recommend the appetizer platter too.  I will say that the mozzarella sticks aren't as good as they used to be. For the entrees, the best ones are the pastas, the Southwest chicken salad, and the pizzas. My favorite deep dish is the classic, pepperoni, but the pizza is expensive. My sister, who has celiac disease, can't eat wheat, so this is one of the few places that serves pizza she can eat. For dessert, order a Pizzookie. The best ones are the salted caramel, white chocolate chunk, and the best one: chocolate chip. I went to BJ's last night with my friend and her mom. Her birthday is tomorrow, so we asked if we could get a Pizzookie. Our waitress was very nice and brought out one. Turns out, they were out of the mini they usually give, so we got a bigger one for free. We looked behind us, and the table behind us had an ENORMOUS Pizzookie. It was the biggest Pizzookie on the menu. It was the size of a extra large pizza with four different sections of different flavors and 8 scoops of ice cream.

307,Michelle W.,"Lake Isabella, CA",35,11,7.0,3.0,2014-07-23,"Food is excellent, don't get me wrong. We come here quite often, and always start with the Santa Fe or avocado rolls as an appetizer, which are both  to die for. My go to meal is usually the California chicken sandwich, which I always take half home to enjoy for lunch the next day. The kids are big on the bbq chicken ranch pizza and the burgers. Quite simply, we've never had a less than stellar meal here. My complaint lies with the service for this review. Most of the time, it's great and we usually have just one server. This last week it was downright confusing. Our server took our order and we never saw or heard from her again. Didn't tell us she was heading to a break (possibly lunch?), just disappeared. A runner delivered our food and  after awhile, I think the busboy, or maybe even dishwasher, took over. He refilled our drinks, pulled our empty dishes, asked if we wanted dessert, and printed our check. I asked if he would be getting the tip since he took over for our server, and was sad to learn that he would not. I'm always a very generous tipper, but I had to draw the line here.

A vodka tonic will set you back $8.50 though, which I feel is SUPER overpriced.  Tomato, mozzarella, balsamic, red onion salad is the BEST. It's tossed with fresh basil and is excellent. This is big enough to be a meal, tbh.  Balsamic glazed chicken is great. Comes with garlic mashed potatoes, shoestring onion rings, and some greens.  Tomato basil bisque is pretty good. Clam chowder is okay, but I'm not a big clam chowder fan anyway.  Any pizza you put together is gonna be excellent. Their sauce is a little too sweet for my liking, but alas.  I've always liked all of their fish I've had, too. Good pasta selection.  Everything here is very, very heavy on sodium, fyi. I know a lot of you try to watch it.  However, our service was so crappy I'm tempted to just give it three stars. 35 minutes to take our order. They weren't busy. When I asked for a lime wedge for my vodka tonic (they usually come standard, why did I even have to ask??) it took nearly ten minutes to get them. By that time, most of the ice had melted.  She took our menus away without taking our order. In the ten minutes between that and when she finally came back to get our order, we had forgotten what we wanted and what they were called. When we expressed we weren't sure we were ordering the right thing, she didn't want to walk over and get us menus again! She played the guessing game instead for a few minutes. Super, SUPER annoying.  It took her nearly 20 minutes to get our bill. Another 10 for her to come and take our card.  Now that I am remembering my frustration, I'm taking them down to three stars.

244,Christopher P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,2.0,2015-01-17,"TL:DR Decent food, mixed drinks, poor service Visited Here for my sister's birthday dinner. I hadn't been for about 2 years but remember loving the place back in my high school and college years.  The Wait was kind of long due to school formals, but my sister scheduled ahead of time so we were seated almost immediately.  For beverages, I ordered BJ's root beer, which is something I always look forward to when coming. My sister and my dad both ordered beers, but my sister's Porter arrived warm, despite being served in a cold glass. The waiter took it away and came back with beer that was slightly colder but still not ideal. My little sister and I both ordered BJ's deep dish pizza, which is always great thanks to a unique, if slightly polarizing crust and generous seasoned tomatoes. Dad ordered a deep dish lasagna, and while he thought it was good, he said that it was not better than grocery store lasagna. Not a ringing endorsement. My mom ordered salmon, which was pretty good. My sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but was dismayed by the lack of condiments both on the burger and the table, as well as the slightly soggy bread. Just before the meal, we had asked for water refills. However, our replacement waiter did not return with our drinks promptly. It wasn't until the middle of the meal when we got the water. At one point, we attempted to flag down another waiter, but to little avail. Of course, when visiting BJ's you just gotta order their famous Pizookies. They're Always a five-star dessert in my book, and they did help save the meal. However, the bill came in with an extra Porter and Pizookies, even though my sister supposedly got a free Pizookie and used a coupon for another one. These mistakes were corrected, but should not have been made. We also discovered a used napkin user the tables which was an unclean end to the visit.

There I stopped a waiter and explained our waiter vanish without giving us our food. More time pass by were the 3 tables all left and were placed with new people. Shortly after that it looked like a chef actually come out and gave us our food. My friends finishing all of her drink asked for another one with a rude manner, which I apologize for her actions for we were all hungry and frustrated. While the drink was getting replaced, I notice my burger I order adding pulled pork was missing the patty! The entire patty was gone! The chef came back out with a not so pleasant face, and I felt bad to ask for him to fix it right after my friend gave him attitude. Sucking it up and eating the burger I then notice that the pulled pork was dry and had no sauce, yet after sitting there for about 2 hours I was to hungry to even complain.

There was only six of us...? Anyway, we finally got our pizza which didn't seem like too long of a wait. We drank for a few hours and the waitress was semi attentive but seemed to care more about talking to her friends. She was reallllllly laggy on getting our drinks towards the end.

135,James D.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,108,,2.0,2015-09-28,"""Watch your step."" BJ's reminds me that customer service is dead.  We live in an era where, in the cost vs. benefit equation, it's more profitable for a restaurant to invest in moving units/product than establishing relationships between companies and customers. And that makes sense because why should a company invest in competent employees when they can procure more profit by hiring quick and selling fast. The truth is that BJ's would rather have ten unhappy customers than two regular customers because on either side of the analysis, they still got paid.  To that effect, employees here don't go above and beyond. They aren't paid to do that. They exhume their motivation: Good performance means doing just enough not to get fired. And should we blame them? In Post Recession America, where men and women who devoted decades of their lives to companies only to get terminated or laid off, loyalty is dead. And loyalty always means that employees will do their best for the customers because value between an employee and a company are mutual.  I have been to BJ's many times. Food is cheap (relatively) and satisfying. But service is deplorable. And that's okay because I don't expect much out of anyone anymore and I mean that about all companies across the board. I can't remember the last time I walked into a restaurant or store and encountered an employee and thought, ""Wow they treated me with respect and work hard.""

I have noticed that each time it's different! It is still really good, however I swap out the dressing it comes with to the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with the avocado egg rolls. Each time something is different, more or less avocado, smaller or larger cuts of tomatoes, some times there is red bell pepper and some times there isn't, and the seasoning and sear of the tuna is always different!!!! Also take out portion is substantially smaller then what you receive if you dine in.  Not cool !! But I still love it. I just wish the consistency could be improved upon.

Yes, I know I'm taking a chance with coming here on my lunch time as I am crammed for time and they are busy, but they seriously took 50 minutes to bring my pizza out.

77,Peter P.,"Bakersfield, CA",407,257,2142.0,3.0,2016-04-08,"BJ's is one of those restaurants for me that sits right in the middle of my mind when thinking of where to eat.  The middle and the reason is that it is not bad nor exciting so I almost want to say it gets forgotten.  One of the odd things is that BJ's apparently has some good craft beers, I drink beer but for some odd reason I have yet to try one here.       The food is good, some better than others and it only goes from what I have tried of course.  I never order the pizzas but my wife and kids like them and when they have ordered them I've tried and liked them as well but not enough to order for myself.  One of the things I really liked but they do not offer in the same manner is their baked potatoes.  It has been a while, but before they would be gigantic baked potatoes and that would be my meal.  However a few visits ago I ordered this and it was a regular sized potato, not something that would be a meal, at least for me.        My most recent visit was for lunch with my wife and I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a boneless breast that was cooked really well and had great flavor, but the mashed potatoes just fell short for me.  My wife ordered a pizza and I grabbed a slice, it was good but yet again, not something I'd order for me.      The service can be inconsistent from each visit I've had here, the last one not so well.  Our waiter took our drink order, then our food order but then went missing for a good 20 minutes.  Other people who were seated after us received their food, some waited on by the same person, some were not.  My question is, if some of the other people ordered what I ordered (chicken), how do they get their food before me?  That is a question that irks me, especially on a lunch time limit since we both were needing to return to work.  I can't for sure what happened, so I chalk it up to a one-time occurrence but it still is annoying.      BJ's is a nice place to eat whether lunch, dinner or just a snack with a beer.  There are times that it can get really packed and wait times are long, but it is nothing different than other restaurants of the same style.  They do have a mobile app that will let you order your food so when you arrive, it will be almost done if not waiting for you.  I think you get a discount for the first order you place and I think you can reserve on it too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=60,3.12,2.76,2.76,2.444,2.9040000000000004

They offer a large selection of appetizers and small bites with my favorites being the cheese sticks, avocado egg rolls, or artichokes. There broccoli cheddar soup is very good and the extra cheese on top makes it even better. My favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken and I get it almost every time I go. Plus who can resist a Pazookie??? They have this heavenly one with chocolate, peanut butter, marshmallow, and ice cream. Sooo good! They have a wide selection of beer although I'm not much of drinker but I will say their craft soda selection is pretty good. I usually go for the classic root beer but the others are tasty too. My kids love it here too with the wide selection of kids meals as well which makes dining with them easier. I have always had friendly wait staff and the one time something was wrong it was fixed promptly and a discount was given.

It was drenched in soy sauce and salty also. I couldn't even taste the food it was so over salted. We had trouble getting our waiter to refill our drinks, even once! Once we got him, he only refilled half of the table. At one point we were sucking on the ice cubes. We never did get anymore refills, not even water. He took twenty minutes to bring our check. Once we had been served our food, we were forgotten about. Even when we asked for more drinks and then finally just give us the check so I could go home and get some water, we were left hanging. I finally tracked him down and said we need to go, please bring our check and don't make us wait another 20 minutes to process it please. Not very impressed. My tab alone was $38 in food.

To top it off I had actually told the waiter to tell the chef that the parm chicken is for the birthday lady over here so he can take care of her order extra special. I guess he did the other way. The late night burger was soggy and had a ton of chille verde sauce in it which we didn't appreciate, also wasn't finished ... I ordered a drink twice and ended up getting it right before we left! We were told that they were short handed and so they were courteous about taking it back. So didn't really eat much and didn't get a drink to begin with. They also took out one of two appetizers were ordered from our tab, hence, the 1 star. Ended up with a $70 bill and didn't enjoy anything from what we ordered.

I always receive exceptional service from the servers there and most of them know my order because I order the same thing everytime which is pasta and a salad. On Saturday, September 24th, I went to BJ's a little after 4 pm for dinner and my server (I believe her name is Gina,) asked me what I would like to order. I told her Fetuccini Alfredo with Penne pasta, blackened chicken on it, no broccoli and a side salad with only spinach leaves. During my giving her my order, she gets out her pad to start writing the order down and said to me ""Wow, that's a lot of food for 1 person.   Upon her seeing the look of anger and frustration, she tried to backtrack by telling me that is not what she meant. I told her I did not want to hear it, told her to get away from me and requested another server. I was humiliated by her comment as there were a lot of people in the original section I was in. I asked to be seated away from other people, spoke to the manager and got another server Merlin who was very kind. My review is not from a personal standpoint, but rather a customer service standpoint. I am beyond tired of crap customer service and in this instance, Gina was on the job serving customers, so that negates her being able to voice her personal opinion on how much or how little food a paying customer orders. While Merlin was very nice and gracious, the above scenario ruined my overall experience this time. And because of all of this unnecessary crap, they failed to add my reward points for this meal as I had asked them to originally.

A while later, I asked if they were finished with my pizza and our server apologized again and took the pizza off my tab, so I ended up getting my pizza for free!

There's always the option to have a drink while you wait, or dine in the bar area if seating is available.  They have several big screens with games on at the bar, which is pretty cool too.

This time it was anything but amazing.  The rice was so undercooked....I took 3 bites and all 3 bites contained grains of rice crunching and breaking on my mouth. I brought it to the waitresses attention and asked her to take it back.  What I got instead was an empty plate they told me I could keep my chicken on since it was fine and they would bring me replacements for the rest. I was brought a small cup of rice and a small cup of black beans to put under the chicken on the new plate. The rice was cooked this time and that's all well and good....however in doing so the new plate had no feta cheese, no cilantro, and no salsa. It was just a piece of chicken with rice and beans. That isn't the dish I ordered and I was really disappointed with the staffs' resolution to the problem, I would have been fine keeping the original chicken if they had prepared a new plate for me with the rice, beans, cheese, cilantro, and salsa so I got the dish I ordered.

My mother in law asks for sweetener for the iced tea...and #2 waiter never brings it. We order food from Bob and #3 brings out the wrong food...a salad instead of a sandwich, soup instead of pasta and the wrong sides with other courses. This means a 25 minute delay in food and the tea never gets sweet. Bob reappears, apologizes and leaves  the wrong tab.

Never have I arrived to pick up my order and had it handed to me without waiting at least another 10 mins. Not once. Never. Ever. Doesn't matter what day it was or what time it was. It was never ready.  My kids love the kids meals, so we order take-out often. Specifically, once a week for the past 6 weeks, and several times before that. After the first few times that I arrive and had to wait, I started stretching the pick up time out longer. It was a game I was playing with myself. Order, wait 15 mins. Go. Order. Wait 20 mins. Go. Order wait 25 mins. Go. It didn't matter how long I waited, my order was never ready.  The last straw was this past Saturday. I ordered my food, showed up 30 mins later and still had to wait another 7-8 mins. I get home (3 mins later) and the food was awful! Cold, salty and my daughter's cheese pizza had no cheese on it. It was just sauce and bread. She took two bites and left it.

I have been here several times and i can't say that i have ever had a bad experience. The staff for the most part is very attentive and the waiters really do their absolute best to cater to their customers. The only reason that this review is not a 5 star is for (2) reasons.  1) No shock top beer. For being a brewery id assume they'd have a variety of all types of beer.  2) It wouldn't hurt for their hostesses to be more welcoming as customers are walking in. Typically if their backs are against the front door, you have to get their attention to be seated.

So we decided to try again. This was about 10 days ago. We went and the first thing was waiting at the podium. Nobody else there a group came in behind us. Finally a hostess comes but has her backed turned to us. My husband and I said party of 2. She turns her back again. We looked at each like here we go again. We get seated and it did take some time for our waitress to come but our server was very bubbly, took our drink order and by the time she was back we knew what we wanted. I had the grilled salmon on a bed of vegetables. My husband ordered the Jambalaya and asked it not be too spicy, so she said mild? he said yes. It took over an hour for our food to get there When it did I took one bite of the salmon and it was tasteless and cold. You had to look carefully to see what was eaten from it, that is how little of it I tasted. My husband said omg this thing is more spice than any other taste. He said he was fine he could eat it. The server came by and I told her, she asked ""do you want to order something else?"" I was skeptical but I said fine. Some guy brought me a menu and I chose parmesan chicken, with mash potatoes. It took over 20 mins to get that. At one point the sever walked by and said they were waiting on mash potatoes. By the time the food came out, the broccoli was cold. She apologized saying she sorry my hubby and I didn't get to eat together.  They sent me a survey which I answered truthfully. I get an email from someone saying they apologize for my experience, and will send us a e gift card with the hopes we will give them a try again. Look for it in a few days.

The fries are usually soggy, the burgers are undercooked even when I request well done, and the sandwiches are cold and plain. I think they need to get better at their customer service, the servers either bother you too much or ignore you the entire time. They are not familiar with their menu items, and when asked to fix something they get easily frustrated. The ""pizookie"" is absolutely nothing special it's just a cookie with ice cream on top.

The silverware arrived shortly AFTER the meals had been delivered.  Fortunately, the meals were excellent. The southern comfort chicken sandwich was delicious. The Parmesan chicken was tasty and the mashed potatoes were superb.  The tables were full of empty dishes. There was no pre-bussing.  The birthday pizooki arrived before others had ordered their desserts. After ordering my dessert, I received a bill. 20-30 minutes later, I asked for the order to be cancelled since it still hadn't arrived and the rest of my party was all finished and had paid their checks.  Several other neighboring tables, had ordered dessert after we had and had already received them.

Where to begin? 1st, we were delayed being seated because they hadn't placed menus on the table. This was complete b.s. The reason we weren't seated is because they didn't have enough chairs for our table. Which we reserved. 2nd, they botched the salads that were ordered. One never came at all. 3rd, there was no rhythm to the food being delivered, so a few received their food, while others did not. Of the 7 entrees ordered, 4 were wrong. They comped 2 of the four then promised coupons for free desserts.

My sister Beverly called ahead, however when we showed up they had no record of her calling. Surprise, not!! The waitress was changed almost immediately and they sent another person to serve us. Me and my Dad ordered the bison burger with fries. Medium well. My sister ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos. The burgers arrived and they were absolutely RARE! I had about half the fries as my Dad. My sisters chicken tacos were fish tasting. Yuk! We showed the waitress our raw burgers and my sister explained her discontent with the fishy tasting chicken tacos. The waitress said she would show her manager and they would remake the burgers for me and my Dad. My sister ordered s chicken sandwich meal instead. The food finally came and now the burgers were well done and burnt . My burger was partially well done and raw in some parts. My Dad's burger was extremely overcooked to the point it was so much smaller than before! The salsa was basically obsolete and missing for his, just one plop of salsa and almost a half onion on his burger? Wow I mean Wow! My sisters chicken sandwich was fine. We informed the waitress and they comped our burgers and the chips and guacamole. The Manager did apologize the first time but no apology for the second time. We ended up paying for my sisters chicken sandwich and the drinks only. I will needless to say that I definitely will not never return here for anything involving food! Absolutely the worst experience ever. The cook is not a cook at all. I myself haven't been a chef for sometime, but I could still do much better than what we received that day. Please tell all your friends to never set foot in this restaurant. You will do yourself a big favor. If I could give negative stars I would. One star for service only.
