We called ahead as instructed at 6:45pm, and were told a 60 min wait so we arrived at 7:30pm. Checked several times with hostess in between the 20 other tables seated ahead of us. Checked at the 90 min mark to let them know they were already well passed(30 mins past) their 60 min wait approximation. Was told there were still 7 tables ahead and she would talk to the manager to see if they can speed us up the list, but to anticipate another 20-30 min wait. By the time we (2 adults/2children) were seated it was already 8:35pm (110 mins.)  The fun didn't end there. We didn't have anyone take a drink order until almost 9pm. When our server Finally arrived to take our drinks, we ordered food at the same time fearing that the place would close before we even got a chance to eat. During the ordering process, every question that our family asked about the menus was followed with a ""I don't know"" or an ""I'm not sure.""  Our salads arrived around 9:10 pm, well before our beverages even arrived.  The food we ordered was really good for the most part. Only bad thing food wise was that I ordered a loaded potato as a side , and she asked ""like loaded how???""  I calmly said butter, sour, cheese and bacon. What I received was a side of sweet Monkey bread butter, a plain potato stuffed with cut up sliced bacon and a side of runny nacho cheese sauce. I was actually pretty amazed at how badly the order was screwed up. Lol. All in all. Cool environment inside. Food and Alcohol menu were very very intriguing. So many modern twists of dishes I was anxious to try. But nearly 3 and 1/2 hours for Saturday night dinner for the Wifey, 2 daughters and I is outta frickin control. Call ahead seating my ass.

Twice now we've been there way longer than we should have been, twice now have we had a manager come and apologize for something that happened, but they didn't DO anything. The first time a cook forgot to cook our order. We were waiting for a while before our waitress caught it, manager came and apologized and that was it. Tonight I was served a RAW bison burger. It was brown on the outsides but inside was mushy, red, and COLD! The first burger came out w nothing but pico bbq and the bun. The second burger came out way over cooked, over seasoned, covered in lettuce and onions. Also, it had a sauce that wasn't on the other.  Our waitress tonight was super slow too. We had to ask for refills, asked for my margarita from the bar, took almost 2 hrs to get our food, pay and leave!  When I finally got my margarita it was way watered down and Had clearly been sitting there for a while. It's a cool place to grab some drinks w friends. I think my husband and I will wait a little while before going back there again, unfortunately. Cooks, step up your game.

We decided to get at like 4:00 and hit happy hour.  The bar was BUSY, but the seating area wasn't.  Our waitress was incredible.  Rebekah V was amazing.  She knew the menu, knew the specials, and got immediately that Hubby and I are a bit of foodies.  We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and couldn't have been more impressed. The flavor and method used were amazing.  So then hubby ordered the fried chicken and I ordered a burger.  While we didn't order the most challenging to cook menu item, they were cooked amazing.   My medium burger was dripping with juices and his chicken was amazingly tender.  It was so good I realized halfway through the meal that we didn't take any pictures.  We did take pictures of Hubby's dessert though - BJ's Baked Beignet.  Oh, and don't skip the handcrafted sodas with free refills.  Hubby and I loved the cream soda!

92,Joe N.,"Dayton, OH",11,92,216.0,2.0,2016-04-04,"My husband and I along with another couple visited this location recently on a Saturday afternoon; we were not impressed with the food but were greatly satisfied with the staff.  The quality of the food we received was definitely not the quality that the Tuttle mall location churns out; We used to live right by the Tuttle location and LOVED LOVED LOVED going there so now that we live here we were excited to know that we again lived close to one. We ordered the siracha queso dip with tortilla chips: queso was luke warm and the chip basket had oil all over it so the chips on the bottom were oil-caked and somewhat soggy. The queso dip was an odd consistency, not what we expected for queso dip.  Avocado egg rolls; these were probably the most horrible things that I have ever tasted.. it did not appear nor taste like it was advertised on the menu. It literally tasted like someone put an avocado in a piece of soggy bread with some red pepper flakes. I remember eating something similar at the Tuttle location and they were PHENOMENAL. Deep dish pizza; this was not horrible nor delicious.. if you are going here, getting a pizza is a safe bet. We got the roasted rep pepper, pepperoni, and sausage one. The other couple got the burger that has shredded beef on it (forget the name)-- he had to dig through it to make sure there was a burger, it looked more like a sloppy joe. It was served with the bun slid halfway off and orange oil bubbles in the condensation on the plate.  Pizookie(sp?); these are very good and I would recommend these for dessert. I got the white chocolate chip macadamia. Staff-Our server was Brittany who was absolutely wonderful. She was very attentive and quick to get what we needed! Ask for Brittany if you come here. If management reads these, please recognize Brittany. There was also a manager (didnt catch his name) who was actively working just as hard as his staff. That also tells a lot about the staff and their support system. He was a man who appeared to be middle aged and he had an olive skin tone.  We aren 't ones to raise heck in restaurants about our food. We expect it to be done correctly the first time. We typically just review the place until we get the impression that the issues have been fixed. We do not plan to revisit this location until we are confident that the food is of higher quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek?start=40,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

58,B A.,"Dayton, OH",0,22,2.0,2.0,2016-05-11,"Wanted to love BJ's. My husband is traveling for several days a week so I decided to use BJ's as my solo woman dinner spot. The first time I ordered a to go platter it was perfect. My second visit was a dine-in with my husband and it was incredible. Our server, Alisha was top notch! So it is with great sadness I have to leave a bad review. I have ordered carside service five times in the last two-three weeks and four times it has been completely wrong! I am very specific when I order, the server on the phone always repeats back to me what I ordered, and it is correct. However, I receive my food and it's wrong each time. How many times can the kitchen manager apologize, and how many emailed gift certificates do I have to receive before the kitchen staff is either reprimanded or replaced???  The last straw was yesterday. I called in from 20 minutes away, got there to pick up my food only to be told it was cooked wrong and they were ""fixing it"" and it would only be ""five more minutes"". I went inside and spoke to the kitchen manager AGAIN, who stated technically the order wasn't wrong because they caught the error before it got to me....DUHHH!!! It did not register with him that I was still inconvenienced because of the additional wait time. Finally my food was there, I checked the bag and the vegetables that are SUPPOSED to come with the meal were missing! Kitchen manager went to the back and brought them out for me with no apology.  The kicker? I get home and eat this stuff and two hours later I am sicker than I have ever been. I was severely nauseous, and had what seemed to be stomach distension and diarrhea that is still ongoing. I don't want to state the obvious, but the timing of this ""illness"" is curious, especially since I do not usually get ill like this. Needless to say BJ's Brewhouse is a distant memory and I am sure one customer won't break them, but I always like to say...buyer beware....or in this case, diner beware.

Have had numerous items and all where outstanding. Beer and drink selection is like no other. Tip us to ask your server and they can help you. Another tip is to use the app and get on the preferred wait list. It tells you about how long the wait is so you know when to arrive.

Wifi is a good addition.  Sadly our experience at the Beavercreek, OH was our first disappointment. Our silverware was dirty.  Food wasn't as described on the menu. Our waitress was very kind and helpful, but it wasn't a good experience. The manager came by to defend the food we were served, but we left unsatisfied.

39,Dixie K.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-28,"So just left the resturant for our offices lunch hour and although the food was excellent the service as well as the manager was terrible! Needless to say I nor my group will be going back anytime soon! I had called about 11:30 today to see if my co workers and I could call ahead and fax over our order for the 8 of us so that when we came in at 12:30 ir would be ready. I spoke to the manager and was told no, and that was fine. He told me that I needed to download their app and that I could place everyone's order through the app and he would put my name on the call a head list for 12:30 and when I got there to give them my name and as soon as we got sat they would place our order. Sounded too good to be true! It was! I got there right at 12:30 and gave them my name. It took about 10 mins for them to have our table ready and that was fine. As soon as I sat down and the waitress came over I told her that I had placed the order online thru their app and told her the order was supposed to be placed as soon as I was seated. She seemed very puzzled and asked if it was for take out? No I said and gave her my phone with the order number in it. She then disappeared for another 10 minutes and came back and said she could not find our order and needed to take it again! So we gave her the order and she left. A few minutes later the manager came over and asked if everything was ok. I told him I was not happpy. Instead of appologizing, he basically said I did not follow directions and I had to show my phone to the hostess when I came in. I asked why when I asked the server about our order she had no idea, and he said they are not trained to know about the app. Sounds like poorly trained servers if you ask me! He said they were working on our order now and should  not take too long. We only have 1 hour for lunch and we were there as a birthday celebration, which he knew. A few minutes later a few of us get our salads and we ask for silverware because we have none. Another server comes by and we ask them for silverware also. Finally more food comes out with our server and we have to ask again for the silverware. She gets it! She has never once asked if we needed refills on drinks or ketchup, which we did and had to take off of another table and we had to ask where the 2 sides of blue cheese was for the Buffalo chicken grill cheeses we had ordered. The worst part of the meal was that there was 8 of us and only 7 of us had food! We thought that it would be out in maybe another minute, it wasn't! Again I had to flag her down and ask, she looked puzzled again and said she never placed her order. She asked if we wanted it to go, since we had to leave in a few. We said yes. The order did come out just a few more minutes later, but nothing was said by the manager or the server and nothing was taken off of our bill!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek?start=80,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.5320000000000005,3.1600000000000006

44,M L.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,3.0,1.0,2016-07-26,"I must say that the time our party spent at the Beavercreek location of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery was by far a nightmare! For the majority of us, it was our first time ever at a BJ's and I guarantee none of us will be back!! We had a table of 10 for a birthday celebration. Not only a large party for a special occasion, but the table was even RESERVED. There was a small wait on the table upon arrival and the host staff graciously took care of the birthday cake that was brought in by our party. We were seated at our table and that is when the terror began.  Our server took everyone's drink order and not once did she promote any of the BJ's beers on tap or bother to mention what beer there was to offer. The mixed drinks were absurdly overpriced for the quality of liquor and taste that came with it. We waited for a good 25 or so minutes before she returned to the table for our food order.  With all the free time we had waiting on our server to acknowledge her biggest party, we all discovered the offer presented by our Yelp accounts. I have posted screen shots of the coupon that came directly from the BJ's Brewery website so that those reading can see that it fails to mention anywhere that ONLY BJ's Brewery members can use the coupon OR that the coupon can only be used once PER TABLE. Laughably so, no one in their right mind would use such a hasty coupon for such a slapstick restaurant.  When our server finally found our table again and realized we had not placed orders yet, she approached us with an overwhelming ""whatever"" attitude and immediately started arguing about the coupon. Coming from someone who has a decade of customer service experience - you NEVER tell the customer they are wrong; especially when the fine print is bright and clear with its guidelines. After thoroughly pissing off the entire table with her bad attitude and taking another 20 minutes just to take our orders, she had the audacity to send her extremely rude manager over. Not once did she apologize for the misunderstanding, confusion, or even offer to comp the coupon for our table. I can understand why she did not apologize for the misunderstanding because there wasn't one arguable. The manager quickly realized that she had angered our entire table and that we were not satisfied with her answer. The best thing she did for us was walk away without a care. Not sure what was such a big deal about honoring one of their own coupons for a 10 top table that was ordering appetizers, entrees, and alcoholic beverages. They were making quite the pretty penny off of us and making my friends birthday celebration into a very sour dining experience for everyone. The food. What is wrong with the food? Nearly every order came out completely wrong! Whether it was burgers undercooked, side items misplaced on the wrong plates, sauces specifically requested to be removed still there, and just down right wrong altogether. Half the table ended up having to send their food back for it to be ""fixed"". However, we did not know that the staff couldn't fix how awfully disgusting all of the food tasted! I ordered the chargrilled mahi mahi and broiled shrimp tacos. The only decent item of my entree was the salsa that came with the chips. I have never had a fish taco that tasted like burnt cardboard or shrimp so hard I couldn't bite into it! It is very clear BJ's uses a selection of frozen seafood and that their kitchen staff ruins any chance of it ever tasting halfway  edible. Several remarks were made to our waitress about the quality of the food and she collected the plates without any response to a single word that was being said to her.   Alas, two hours of hell later, the birthday cake was finally brought to our table. Thankfully it was made by a local bakery rather than coming from the BJ's Brewery kitchen or I might not have survived to write this review! To put the icing on the cake, it was brought out quickly and we were left without a staff member assigned to us. I question, how does a party serve a cake without plates or silverware? Naturally, we had to wait to grab our servers attention again to make that request. I assume you might have to be a BJ's Brewery member to get that kind of common service..  To end on this distasteful event, the majority of the checks of our party were wrong and were ever so slowly fixed. I feel embarrassed and absolutely ashamed for the owners of this franchise to have such a horrible and unmindful staff to be running their newly opened restaurant. It's only a matter of time before another franchise takes over this location. Hopefully with better service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek?start=60,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.5000000000000004,3.2800000000000002

28,Erin S.,"Dayton, OH",184,13,,3.0,2016-09-05,"I went to bjs brewhouse last night for dinner. When I got there the host asked if we wanted to sit in open seating by the bar and there was a booth available and we said yes and walked up there. The two booths were dirty and covered in old dishes from the previous table. I'm not sure why she would offer us to sit there when the tables weren't clean. This was a trend throughout the night. It seems the servers had no intentions of busing the tables because the table next to us was dirty the whole time we were there and many other around. Our server was nice. She asked for our drinks but it took 10-15 min to get them. All the food was excellent. We got the chicken potsticker appetizers and split the Mediterranean tacos and crispy jalapeño burger. The sides were the crispy thin fries and Brussels sprouts. We loved the food! It was great! We also decided to order a flight of the famous brewhouse beers. We each got our own consisting of 4 beers 5oz each for 6.95. I thought this was a fair price and a great idea. You could choose from any beers on tap. I orders the blonde ale, the piranha pale ale, the takonic (no idea if this is proper spelling) stout, and the berry burst cider. The server took both of our flight orders without writing anything down. When the server set the beers down she named all the ones I order except the piranha beer she called it oasis and I asked her if it was the piranha and she  said she would check. She came back and said yes it was. I know this was not a mistake because she deals with theses beers all the time and my boyfriend and I try lots of different beers as well. The beer was too dark to be a pale ale, it looked more like an amber and on top of that my boyfriend ordered the piranha as well and they looks and tastes completely different. Then when we got the check she rang in the oasis! So she knew she gave me the wrong beer and just didn't wanna feel like getting the right one and she lied. I would have been happy to drink it if she admitted her mistake I would have said it was okay. But she lied to my face and insulted my intelligence.

BJ's is your typical American chain with frozen food and sloppy presentation, but throw on top of that dirty floors and a staff that only had personality when they were yucking it up amongst themselves and you've got a mess of a place to eat.  We arrived on a Saturday at about 2:00pm, and though they weren't even half full and were overly saturated with waiters we had to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to finally appear. She said the right things like ""my pleasure"" but had the personality of a piece of cardboard.  We started with the Fried Artichokes appetizer. They looked pretty and crisp on the outside, but the inside of each was freezing cold and the lemon garnish was spotty brown and dry as a bone. Not a pleasant way to start.  My husband ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast meal. He was disappointed since his chicken was a LOT of fatty gristle, and his tacky ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes & broccoli were cold to the touch. I ordered the North Beach Mahi Mahi with Shrimp meal off the ""Enlightened"" Menu. HORRIBLE. First of all, I swear on everything I can that they served me COD instead of Mahi Mahi. It was the most flavorless, wettest, chewiest piece of fish I've ever had, NOTHING like the hundreds of chunks of Mahi Mahi I've dined on in my lifetime.  The shrimp were just mediocre, the couscous was sticky and broke apart in large hard chunks as if it were reheated from someone else's meal a day or two before, and the whole dish was literally swimming in broth that had way too much mint in it. I also ordered broccoli on the side, which (just like with my husbands meal) was served ice cold and super mushy. This was probably the worst meal I've ever had at a chain restaurant in a long, long time. We also had to argue with our waitress for a few minutes about the $10 off a $35 meal offer listed on their website (she was trying to force us into signing up for their rewards program just to receive this even though it doesn't state that at all on the website -- we informed her we'd never be coming back, so no need for rewards). Finally, after talking to her manager for almost 10 minutes, she ""caved"" and acted like she was doing us a huge favor by docking the $10 off our bill. Wow.

I've been to BJ's multiple times and am always satisfied with their food. The service has always been great for me. It is a chain restaurant and they offer their own beer selection.  They are known for their deep dish pizzas and pizookies.  Bj's tends to get very busy on Friday nights and the weekend so you can either call ahead to put your name down on the list or use their app to put your name down as well. The wait times can start from 30 minutes to over an hour on a busy night. Be prepared to wait! It's a great atmosphere and you can always order a drink or two at the bar while you wait for your table to be ready. There are plenty of options to choose from and at times, their menu can be somewhat daunting. However, there is something for everyone to choose from. They offer the lighter options and their signature dishes as well. I have ordered burgers, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, and of course, their pizookies (cookie baked in a pan topped with ice cream) during my visits.  I would recommend ordering a turkey burger, California Grilled Chicken sandwich, BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, or any of their pizzas. All of their pizookies are great! It comes fresh out of the oven with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream. I mean, who would not like that? I always have a difficult time when choosing the cookie because I just want a bite of all the variations! The most popular pizookie is Chocolate Chip. Cookies and Cream is also delicious as well!

67,Christopher C.,"Dayton, OH",0,7,2.0,1.0,2017-05-20,"1st visit.  I asked for a sample of beer and was literally brought enough to stick your tongue in. Not even a table spoon. Was told that they only give small samples for non company branded beer. I rolled my eyes and moved on-I kinda get it.  2nd  visit.  Asked for a sample of their craft beer and was brought nothing short of spittle (less than 1/2 tablespoon) in the glass. I'm shocked. I'm not exaggerating. This is marketed as a craft brew house but you can't even sample a beer. Again, I move on and chaulk it up to corporate greed and a company ""not getting it"".  Then my bill comes and I'm actually charged .05 cents for my 1/2 teaspoon of a sample of beer. Are you F-ing kidding me? That's it. I very politely told the waitress that the food and her service were great and that it would be reflected in her tip but that I'm not paying the .05 cents for the spittle.  Well, the manager then comes out, as he should, and I tell him great food, great service, horrible marketing and customer service with their beer (very politely). He had knocked off the 0.5 cents but said that it is illegal in Ohio to not charge for alcohol. I told him that I would be happy to pay .25-.50 cents per sample. If in fact, I got a sample (shot glass) size. We had a cordial discussion and in short, his eyes glazed over at my comments. The fact is, according to his comments, he broke the law for paying my .05 cents.  I have never ever been charged for a sample of beer anywhere in Ohio. Only at BJs Brewhouse and for literally spittle.  IN SHORT So, if you like craft brews, move on to another brew house. This is not the place for you.  Side Note: I'm going back next week to get a picture of the sample and show you the 0.5 cent charge (It's the only thing I will get). I'll share another review then with pictures on the experience.

89,Linda H.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,2.0,2017-08-19,"Have been to BJ's many times and always was a good experience ... however, not so on Friday evening.  We brought friends here from out of town & was so disappointed in the experience.  Arrived at 4:30pm (before the Friday night crowds start to arrive) and found the restrooms to be in very bad condition ~ I told the manager & they said they would get someone to clean them up (?!?)  The mushroom appetizer was good, but the flatbread was ordered (dry, no flavor and seemed it was possibly reheated ??)   The Brussels sprouts were sent back (overdone) and several other items were cold when served.  At that point, we didn't send anything back, ate what we could & left.   I doubt I will be going there again anytime soon.  The trio Pizookie was the only thing that saved the night .......  Linda Hausfeld",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek?start=40,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76
4,Sirron B.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,231,838.0,4.0,2017-08-25,The service there is outstanding. They will help you explain all the different types of beers drinks and foods when you leave you will be more knowledgeable about beers and hops than when you arrived. They have a well verse menu they have everything from steak to Burgers to shrimp. Salads whatever you want they have. During football season they have live music out on the patio where you can come relax and listen to some nice bands and enjoy the football game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76
77,Chad W.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,9,,4.0,2017-09-02,"Good American fare. They have a set of their own brand beers along with a small set of other craft beers. I was personally disappointed when they recently changed the recipes on several menu items like the Salmon Quinoa Bowl, but perhaps other people like the new versions. One downside is that it's often busy, so we typically eat at the bar or in the bar area to avoid the line for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek?start=20,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8

11,Craig K.,"Zionsville, IN",1,100,4.0,4.0,2017-11-08,I love this chain. They have a wide variety on their food and drink menu. The atmosphere is very nice and I've always had great service. Their pizzas are awesome and most of the apps I have tried are excellent as well. Tonight I tried a steak with an upgraded side of turmeric roasted cauliflower. It was good. Not great. The steak was fairly bland and lacked seasoning. The cauliflower was good but not worth the upcharge. I will definitely return but skip the steak next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.96,3.96,3.96,,3.96
2,Tom S.,"Dayton, OH",74,112,2.0,1.0,2017-11-08,"I was there a few days ago. The primary reason is because I had found a place where there were people pre-buying veteran's a beer for Vets Day; they do this online. I thought how nice! So I wanted to partake as a veteran. I went to BJs to redeem the coupon for the beer and also decided to buy an appetizer, which was the sliders. The sliders were pretty much hideous. The buns were black and clearly burnt. The meat patties were clearly over cooked and crispy. I'm pretty sure that burger patties are not supposed to be crispy. The presentation was very sloppy. They couldn't be bothered with building the sliders so that they were lined up and ready to eat. I had to do this myself. The grilled onions were black and I think mostly disintegrated during the cooking process. Obviously, they have very little quality control on their food. The cook didn't care; the expediter didn't care, if they have one; and the waitstaff didn't care what they served! Then the server/bartender had the audacity to tell me that the pre-purchased beer was for their brand only!  I had ordered a Stella. I told her she should've told me that in advance. Quite frankly, I was insulted and disappointed in the entire experience! The food sucked and to ask me to pay for a beer that someone else wanted to buy for a veteran--really?! Shame on YOU BJs! Never again--there are many better restaurants to frequent than this dump. Don't waste your time. 11/12/2017  BTW...The General Manager says they tried to fix the issue....During the last visit...the waitress tried to charge me 3 times for the full price of the sliders + beer; and, for some reason she couldn't see that on the bill herself--I had to tell her 3x's!! I did not get the entire bill free, either. The Manager's attitude was not that great; she seemed bothered by the situation and condescending. And unfortunately, the re-fire sliders weren't much better (ie, burgers overcooked, onions black & disintegrated, etc). The Manager in no way checked to ensure the re-fire was good, much less perfect. Thanks, but no thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88
0,Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",500,332,1635.0,5.0,2017-11-12,"They are located at a large mall area so there is plenty of parking there, not always you will find a empty spot closer to the restaurant as there are many other restaurant close by so the spots near the door get taken quick.  The place inside is pretty large there are plenty of tables and lots of staff personnel so it's a fairy quick and efficient service here. The waitress we got was pretty good and quick to get our drinks and the appetizers, that shows that this place is well organized and super efficient with the ticket times. The menu is very populated with plenty of choices for all tastes. They are known for their pizzas and burgers so it is worth to give it a go on those specially during their specials as they do have some specials for those items during different days of the week as well as beer specials.  Here is what I had: STRAWBERRY MOJITO- this mojito was pretty nice and sweet, plenty of fresh fruit in it as well. If you a sweet drink liver this is a drink for you.  HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH- I was pleasantly surprised by this sandwich it was delicious! They have a Alfredo sauce in it that made the sandwich taste so special that I did not want the meal to end. I has as a side a garlic knot and that was a fresh and warm garlicky piece of heaven. I appreciate that they accommodated to my request and served me that instead of fries on the side.  CHURROS- the CHURROS desert is is a pretty large desert so you possibly can share with more than 3 ppl, it is perfect to dip the CHURROS into the ice cream and eat them while the CHURROS are warm.  They also have military discount for the meal so don't forget to ask for your discount.  My overall impression of this restaurant was pretty positive, fronvthe ambiance to the service and the prices this is a great place to come and celebrate a special day with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
5,Alicia S.,"Lakewood, WA",8,11,1.0,1.0,2017-12-14,"While we typically love BJs . This review is due to their inconsistent food. We go here 3-4 times a month for dates. On occasion , the rice for the barbacoa chicken has been a bit undercooked. Tonight , my boyfriend ordered it and the rice was so hard you would think they didn't even cook it. Very disappointing to get food of Lower quality than fast food for triple the price . I also used to get the ahi salad but the last time the fish was not fresh and I got sick. Management needs to get on top of food quality. Since they opened they have had issues with timing (appetizers not coming out at all or salads right before entree ) but when the food is inedible ... looks like Mackenzie river is our new go to .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92

1,Victoria H.,"Dayton, OH",27,15,35.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"This was our first and will be our only experience here. We ordered a delivery pepperoni extreme deep dish pizza. So I'll start with the good first.  The pizza has a nice taste and the crust is good. However, it was not 30 dollars worth of delicious, nor 30 dollars worth of bread; which is mostly what it was. I have attached the photo from the menu and photos of the pizza we received. It hardly had any cheese or sauce.  When you pay that much for a pizza you expect it to be you know ""extreme"". The only extreme thing about this pizza is it's cost. If this pizza had the toppings like in the menu I'm sure it would have been wonderful and maybe close to worth its price, but sadly it did not live up to the expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-beavercreek,3.84,3.47,3.47,,3.6180000000000003
