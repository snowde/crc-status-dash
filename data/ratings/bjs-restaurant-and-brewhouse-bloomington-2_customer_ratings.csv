25,Max U.,"New York, NY",28,3,,2.0,2017-06-23,"Very poor service. Our waitress was passive aggressively rude all night. She had a condescending comment or comeback for the few questions or requests we had. Refills were hard to come by and when she did stop by the table all she would have to say is that she put in the order for the refill. Then to top it off she brought us the wrong check halfway through the meal. It wasn't until after the meal that we examined the check and noticed the error. Not a huge deal, it's happened before. However, when we notified the waitress of the error her response was ""well you should have told me sooner so I could have printed the right one out."" A fitting end to an all around bad service.  Food was solid all around though, albeit a little pricey. That's what made the experience so disheartening. Not one person at the table was unhappy with their meal. Would give them one more chance based on that, certainly not the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2?start=20,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003

White cheddar mashed potatoes were thick, cheesy and delicious. Asparagus was a disappointment. Tips were so dry that they were inedible. I don't even think the stalks were trimmed after they were received because a few still had a white inedible portion at the bottoms. The portions of the asparagus that were edible were very bland. I seasoned them myself with the extra steak seasonings and juices remaining on my plate.

Go to any of the other picture-menu chains and you'll get basically the same warmed over stuff. It's a ""Greek Menu,"" in that they have just about anything anyone could want. That's really about all you need to know about the quality of the food in a restaurant. We've been there three times merely because it's close, and it was all pretty bad. I give it two stars merely because it's nicely designed, other than the kitchy garage doors on the inside, trying to make it look like it's been repurposed.

If you are looking for local, this is not it. I am a local lover in B-town but this mall area has struggled and I think this restaurant will do well and with a huge beer selection will be a good option for college students and locals alike. Open floor plan High ceilings Mobile app with points and you can pull up your order (and see if it is accurate) and get coupons. We had a guy one get one free entree coupon tonight  The husband said the wings were pretty standard. Sriracha Brussels were ok, a little hard in the middle. Wouldn't repeat. Seared tuna salad was good. The pickled cucumbers were the unsung hero of this salad. Watch out for the wasabi blobs. Recommend the honey ginger dressing instead of the red wine vinaigrette it comes with on the menu. Flatbread pizza was good and I will order it again, on a Monday when it is half price.

9,Stanley P.,"Trafalgar, IN",15,10,22.0,4.0,2017-07-10,"We decided to drive down to Bloomington on Father's Day and try out the new BJ's Brewhouse. I had heard some pretty good things about it. Personally, I would have chosen a different name for the place, if you know what I mean. haha. Bottom line: BJ's Brewhouse gets a Solid 4 stars. A lot of things about the place were really good. We only waited a few minutes to get seated, which surprised me because I expected on Father's Day there would be a big wait anywhere you go. But then, that's pretty typical for Bloomington in the summertime. The waitress came up right away and took our drink orders and appetizer orders. Our main food orders were a mixed bag. I got the full rack of ribs, which was very good, but not the best in Bloomington. They were out of a couple of things we ordered, which was a little bit disappointing, but understandable. Everybody we dealt with there was very nice. I liked the atmosphere. The selection of beer was amazing. I got a dark beer that was kind of a house special and really liked it a lot. The highlight of our experience there was that they gave me a 2017 Father's Day drinking glass. I love it!

15,Tiffany K.,"Bloomington, IN",67,129,708.0,4.0,2017-07-23,"I really enjoyed my experience at BJ's Brewhouse. There was a long line on Friday evening, but there is a long wait in most restaurants on Friday evenings. There was a 45 minute wait, so my boyfriend and I just walked around the mall until they texted us. They were very punctual about wait time and we were seated at a table for two after our 45 minute wait.  We were looking at a menu for a few minutes and our server had not arrived. One of supervising managers saw us looking around and took our drink orders. He apologized for the wait, gave us a rundown of the menu, and got a server over to help us. He really knew that he was talking about, especially with their beer selection. BJ's occasionally has Zombie Dust, but it sells out very quickly. My boyfriend ordered 3 Floyds' Alpha King. I ordered their strawberry lemonade. It was very sweet but tart.  For our entrees, we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Burger and Southern Comfort Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Fried Steak Burger was a hand breaded, fried beef patty with gravy, pepper jack cheese, tomato, mayo, and a fried egg. It also comes with avocado, but it got mine without. The Southern Comfort is a crispy chicken sandwich topped with sliced ham, bacon, alfredo sauce, swiss cheese, and mayo. Both came with a side of fries.  Our server dropped off our check right before we were done eating our main course. I was surprised that she just dropped off the check without even offering dessert since Pizookies are BJ's signature dessert. We ended up flagging her down so we could order a cookies n cream pizookie.

Its was a wide open space but table seating was pretty intimate. They had good beer and friendly service. The menu was HUGE and many items looked delicious.

Our entire experience from beginning to end was excellent, excellent, excellent. As soon as we walk through their cool revolving door, we were greeted by a handful of extremely friendly hostesses. I don't know if they're especially trained to do that, but they acted like they were standing there a whole day just waiting for us to come in! LOL We were quickly seated, and a very friendly, knowledgeable waiter came up and waited on us. Everything that we got to eat was just about as good as it could be. We got the BJ's chicken wings for appetizer. Truly some of the best we've had anywhere. They have an extensive selection of gluten-free entrees and food items, which is really a fantastic thing for me. I got the New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl. It was gluten-free, and fantastic.

The inside is very atmospheric and welcoming which only adds to the dining experience. However I must say that considering that we went in august and the weather was so nice, it was a shame that they put the AC on such a low temperature. We were shivering all night!

This place was pretty damn good for a chain. I don't like beer but they seemed to have a really good selection (my boyfriend loves beer so I have a pretty good idea even though I don't like it). I started with the tortilla soup which I was actually really surprised by. It has fresh avocado and a nice kick. I love spicy food so I was surprised even I found it to have some spice. I got the half rack of ribs and garlic green beans. I'm not a big ribs person but they sounded good and I'm happy with my choice. The beans needed a bunch of salt but I salt almost everything. But I seriously salted them like 6 times. My mom raved about their parmesan crusted chicken and their beignet dessert. My baby had grilled cheese with broccoli and carrots for a side. I think she put the crayons in her mouth more but she's kind of young and doesn't really bite into sandwiches so well yet.

Burgers are great.  Pizooki (giant cookie covered in ice cream) are great - especially the Monkey Bread one.  They have many beers on tap if that's your thing and plenty of TV's near the bar area.  Food quality is great, as is the pricing for what you get.  If you like Root Beer, they have their own brew on tap and it's fantastic.  Highly recommend as a family friendly option in Bloomington!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

OK so we went back again just call us gluttons for punishment went at 5 o'clock on a Saturday evening one waitress came to take our drink order we never saw her again we asked the next waiter that came by to take our order where our drinks were they went looking then the third one came by and we asked where the hell are those drinks? the appetizers we ordered showed up before the drinks the spinach artichoke dip was cold in the bowl just terrible terrible service at the end of the day I can't say it any clearer terrible service isn't getting any better damn shame they got good food I would say probably the only way we can do anything there further will be to just do carry out if at all,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2?start=20,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
18,Dan W.,"Charlotte, NC",2,33,,1.0,2017-10-31,"What a shame. The food was pretty darn good, but the service was absolutely pathetic...especially given that it was barely past 11am and the place was empty. Our waitress clearly had better things to do than actually wait on customers. She never checked on us, left my drink empty, and only became attentive when it was time to pay (even interrupting my dessert to ask if she could take away the ticket). Strange. Oh well, there are lots of places to choose from in BTown so I probably won't bother was this joint again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

Ribeyes were unseasoned even though there was seasoning on it. I kept adding salt and it never got any flavor.

Would have liked it during my meal. She made sure she didnt take responsibilty for any mistakes.

26,Erin T.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-01,"Horrible experience!!! Went with large group for a party. More than half of the groups order was cold and the remaining had to wait FOREVER to receive food. One order was forgotten entirely and the waitress didn't even notice. He didn't get his meal until everyone else was finished eating. At no time did the manager come out to check on our group. You'd think with all the issues with orders the manager would come to apologize...NOPE!!! One of our members went to talk with the manager and was told he'd look into the issue. When we got the check nothing was done. Come on, with that many problems at least comp the appetizers. I've had similar situations at other restaurants but been compensated for the problem. This is a first!!!Needless to say, none of us will be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

24,Carlie G.,"Bloomington, IN",26,5,,4.0,2017-12-11,"BJ's is pretty good so far. I've dined there about 4 times so far. The service is alright, but the food has been great. I've tried many of the dishes, of which they have quite the variety (their menu is huge): the Portobello Swiss burger, Black and Bleu burger, Lemon Thyme Chicken, mozzarella sticks, Santa Fe salad (with shrimp), Root Beer float, the house salad, the Cookies and Cream Pizookie, and the Salted Caramel Pizookie. One of the things I enjoy most about these items and their menu is that they do list the calories of all their options. Very helpful for the health-conscious. All the food was delicious and came out really fast. The only negative encounter I've had so far at BJ's was the last time I dined there. The waitress accidentally dropped three full glasses of tea and water near our booth. The glasses shattered and liquid thoroughly splashed on our shoes and pants. When the manager came to assist us and ask if everything was alright, he didn't bother offering us any sort of discount or offering to cover our dry cleaning or anything that I would expect from my manager. He barely gave condolences, either. Just a bit odd and left us feeling a bit lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

Because it's a chain, food quality is pretty consistent. I used to only eat pizza and pizookies at BJ's but I've ventured out to other parts of their menu: *BJ's Premium Wings - No complaints here - solid wings. Good crisp & good marinade/sauce. I've had it with both BJ's Peppered BBQ and Nashville Hot. Both have a nice kick but aren't overwhelmingly spicy.  *Roasted Portobello & Asparagus (sliced portobello, asparagus, baby field greens, balsamic vinaigrette, dried cranberries, goat cheese, toasted pepitas) - I love this salad. this is usually what I order. It's filling and only 290 calories. I hate it when menus have to list calorie counts - ha. *Fried Wisconsin Cheese Curds - for the amount you get, I think it's overpriced ($6.50) because there are places in town like Scotty's and Brothers that have better value with their cheese curds. But, hey I love me some cheese curds *Roasted Golden Beets with Basil & Goat Cheese - I just like that they have this as a healthier option on the menu. Tiny portion because it's in the snack section. Their app has also been game-changing. At first, I thought it was annoying that another restaurant chain had to come out with another app but it's proven quite useful. I've ordered thru the app for pick up and it's a good way to view the menu in advance.  This location also daily brewhouse specials: *Mon: half-off any large deep dish or tavern-cut pizza AND $5 Margs *Tues: $3 Pizookies AND half off wine by the glass or bottle *Wed: $10 loaded burgers with unlimited fries AND $4 BJ's Craft Beers *Thu: $13.95 half rack or $18.95 full rack baby back pork ribs with a house salad, two signature sides and a mini pizookie AND $5 Call Drinks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
3,Wendy S.,"Bloomington, IN",5,149,163.0,3.0,2018-01-05,"I'm a local restaurant fan and snobbishly avoid the chain restaurants (Chili's , Applebee's, etc) located in the College Mall area.  My husband gets a Chili's craving a couple of times a year and we were on our way there when we passed BJ's.  BJ's is a slightly hipper version of the usual mall chain restaurant.  The restaurant is bright and open with lots of TVs.  The main draw is beer- there were more than 50 on tap and there was a full bar.  The menu is huge...I was happy to see that calories were listed for every entree because every menu item was a caloric splurge.  Even the items labeled as ""light"" had more than 700 calories!  The cuisine was nothing original or different from the usual mall chains and much probably arrived frozen and prepared offsite.  We tried the dumplings (greasy and not flavorful), calamari (well prepared, but the marinara sauce was bland), the baby back ribs (Delicious!  Tender with sweet and tangy sauce), and shrimp tacos (well seasoned but served with what I think was supposed to be guacamole but tasted like green mayonnaise).  Service was friendly and attentive.  Overall, food and beer were better than the usual mall restaurants.  For a slightly more local experience, and a similar menu, try the Scotty's Brewhouse downtown...for a true brewery experience (and truly delicious food) Bloomington has lots of better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bloomington-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
