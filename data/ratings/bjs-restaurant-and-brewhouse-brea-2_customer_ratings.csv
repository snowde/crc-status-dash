I love their cheeseburger and their caesar salad, but most of all, I love their pezookis!   I brought a friend from out of town here to try their beer sampler and food, she left absolutely ranting and raving about BJs and she wished there was one in our hometown.  BJs has always provided consistent customer service and food. Their prices are moderate, their portions are reasonable and they have an excellent selection of beers and food.

I also ordered the never ending soup and salad combo for i think $8? the boyfriend ordered some weird chicken over rice dish...his was good he said? i didn't try any! All in all my food was great...i had clam chowder first...it was super heavy and some caesar salad...then my next order was a house salad with light italian (horrible choice of salad dressing) and then i ordered a tiny cup of minestrone soup.  The boyfriend ate all his food..and the only thing i have to complain about was they messed up my order...in the sense that the guy charged me for a dinner plate not the lunch special which was quickly rectified so it wasn't that big of an issue.

They took like 4 pizzas home)!  The garden salad was fresh, crisp, and delicious.  The pizzas were fantastic!  YUM!  Servers were out on the patio all the time bringing drinks and taking away dirty/finished dishes.  It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend BJ's for any large event like this!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=700,3.56,3.35,3.35,2.9920000000000004,3.434

I know it sucks that they don't take resos. But at least they accept call ins. If you call in while you're on your way to BJ's, they will add your name to the wait list.

Overall the food is good, I prefer the appetizers over their main dishes though. Lettuce wraps, avocado rolls, etc all very tasty.

385,Kingweasel X.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,34,,2.0,2012-04-15,"Here's some irony: We wanted pizza and went to BJ's, but after looking at the menu decided other, non-pizza-y stuff sounded way better. It was a busy Saturday afternoon and server Shaun was pleasant enough, though we both asked for iced tea and never received it. Instead getting ice water that was refilled in fits and starts from a half full carafe with no ice in it at all. His inability to hear us was matched only by ours to hear him, as he was incredibly soft spoken for the atmosphere in this place. $8.95 Potato skins? Haven't had any in ages once we realized how incredibly bad they are for someone to eat more than a sliver of them. I really liked the fried-ness of them. I didn't like the stinginess with which they doled out the cheese and bacon, though. Also, the monkey dishes they use for dipping sauce are WAY too small. $5.95 Clam chowder was tasty and a decent portion size as well. $3.50 Fried artichoke hearts were not too oily and tasted good. Great price since it was an add-on to an entrée. $12.75 Chicken fried steak was quite disappointing. The vegetable mix (baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and squash) didn't really suit the dish. One decent sized dollop of their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes had two hamburger patty sized cfs's canted at an angle leaning on the mashed potatoes. A meager splash of thin pepper gravy was dropped on top of this. When I asked for extra gravy they server brought another one of those half ounce monkey dishes. Gee, thanks buddy. $17.50 Miso salmon dinner was a bright spot for the visit. The wife liked it more than a lot, although she did mention the rice bed it was on tasted like it came out of a cheap box.  All in all, it didn't really make me want to return any time soon.

I think it might be that you cannot check in here. hmmmm... Well lets start off with the beer.  They do call themselves a brewhouse and their beers do not disappoint.  They are relatively inexpensive and are much better than the other beers you may order (bud light, miller lite, etc....)  I have tried about half of them and am pleased with all of them. The food here while good is a little pricy.  With their specialty deep dish pizzas costing around $10 for a small this is just outrageous.  Their pizzas are about the size of a pizza hut personal pan pizza and they charge you $10 no way jose.  That is why I only order pizza during happy hour when it is half off.  Definite win.  The pizzas are of high quality, they are delicious, but definitely not worth $10, maybe about $8 but not $10.   The real reason for me to come here though is the pizookie.  It is a warm freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream and man is it delicious.  They come in flavors from the original chocolate chunk to red velvet.  I have tried almost all of them and they are all equally delicious.  I have come here on a few occasions just for the pizookie and I wish that they would have these go on special on happy hour too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=460,3.52,3.42,3.42,3.088,3.4600000000000004

I really appreciated it and it is unusual to find this quality in a 'chain'.  My regret was not getting the names of our servers so I could write a nice letter to their corporate office - they deserve this recognition. I would highly recommend coming here with a large group (providing you arrange it ahead of time).  I've been to BJ's (different city) with a larger group a couple of times and it was a disaster - but I think the difference was they knew about our party well in advance and could plan and staff accordingly.  :D  Good job Brea BJ's!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=460,3.52,3.45,3.45,3.0920000000000005,3.478

He came by often to check up on us and was friendly. The hostesses greet us nicely and the wait on a Friday night was surprisingly not too long! But the food took a loooong time to come out. For appetizers, we got the Chicken Pot Stickers which were blaaaaand, even with the sauce. I could honestly make better dumplings at home.  For entrees, I got the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I was surprised how little the portion was when it said it was 1560 calories! I initially thought the lemon-butter sauce would be a light drizzle or was not a thick sauce, but it's extremely thick has no scent of lemon or butter and just seemed like it consisted of only cream. It came with angel hair pasta and four pieces of garlic bread. I couldn't even finish it just knowing that average size portion dish was over 1000 calories.... Unbelievable. The taste of it was a little bland and creamy, no salt, but the chicken was nice and juicy! My mom got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi, I believe. It was a little bit on the dry side and the rice pilaf was extremely sweet. My sister got a hamburger and fries, which was extremely large. The fries were thin and delicious!  For dessert, we ordered BJ's Famous Pizookie, which was okay. The cookie is sooo sweet and gooey, but the ice cream was delicious! It's not a memorable dessert, which it claims to be, but it's fun to share with friends or family. Overall, I had a nice first experience at BJ's.

We came almost right when it opened so no wait for us. What we got: BJ's P.M. Porter ($3.50): so my BF was tempted to get this after seeing ""Dark Caramel and Chocolate""...I had a sip and bleh! He didn't like it either...but I mean if you like dark ale... Southern Fried Chicken ($6): yum! it was a fried chicken steak on top of mashed potatoes and surrounded by corn and roasted red peppers. I'm not a mashed potatoes kind of person, but I wanted the chicken steak...but the mashed potatoes were pretty good, it was creamy and smooth. The chicken wasn't try and it had a nice crunch to it. As for the corn, you can't really mess up corn... Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos ($6): comes with black beans as well. I had a bite of a taco and it was pretty good, but not something I or my BF would get again. The bean comes with a couple of tortilla chips and the BF said it was pretty good. Peanut Butter, Red Velvet, & White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie Trio ($9): my BF and I couldn't decide on one pizookie so why not get 3! Peanut butter was his and he really liked it and I took a bite of it and it was very peanut butter-y. Red velvet was mine and it was delicious! It had cream cheese bits in it. I've had a couple red velvet cookies before, but this is definitely one of the better tasting ones. The white chocolate macadamia nut was for both of us to share and by then I was stuffed. I had a bite, but there was nothing special about it. Definitely get the red velvet pizookie! Service: It has always been the same every time I come. It was just okay.

The texture of the pizza was soft and fluffy. I know it's not the real deal in terms of deep dish but it was pretty good. I've also had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. This was a huge sandwich! The Pulled Pork was tender and had lots of flavor. The sauce was made up of smoky BBQ ranch sauce and BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale. The crispy onion rings in the sandwich were great. The crispy thin fries that came with the sandwich were pretty good. They were crispy and not overly salty. The coleslaw here was also good!   I also like getting BJ's Famous Pizookie. The cookie is fresh and hot and topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream makes it perfect.  The service here usually has been great! The servers are very attentive. The seating arrangement is interesting They have U-shaped booths that face booths on the opposite side. Meaning that if I were to sit in a U-shaped booth, I'd be potentially staring at people dining in the booths on the other side.

She brought out the water.. without lemons and said she'll be right back with the lemons. Again, she came back and took our orders without the lemon. I could let the lemon go, it was not that big of a deal. When she took our order, one of my friends ordered her salad with dressing on the side and to take out the fried onions on top because she's allergic. When her food came out, they totally forgot to even include the dressing on the side and there were fried onions on top of her salad. We didn't want to make a big deal out of it so she just asked her if she can get the dressing as she took out the onions by herself. The biggest thing that got me was that there were no utensils on the table when we arrived and we had to ask for them after our food had already come out. It wasn't a bad dining experience, I just wish the server was more prepared so we didn't have to call her so often to get something for us.

If your hungry for a great lunch for a good price Bjs has that for you. They also have great beer that goes well with the food here (Jeramiah Red is one of my favorites). I believe Bjs is known for their pizza, and their pizzas are great, especially the bacon cheeseburger specialty pizza, but i have to say the four stars is not for just the pizza. In fact, many of the other choices on the menu are just as good or even better.  I often choose Bjs as the place to go to watch a laker game. They have a pretty good happy hour. Decent prices for drinks and half off on personal pizzas. The environment is also great for happy hour. They have big screens, serve pitchers of beers and it isn't usually too difficult finding open tables.  If your in the mood for lunch, dinner, or a quick beer and snack i would highly recommend Bjs.

I had the Cajun Pasta and I absolutely loved it. It was just the right combination of spicy and creamy and the portions were nice and substantial.

She then attempted to fix it and 25 minutes later came back with the check. It was still wrong. When we alerted her she rolled her eyes at my friend and then walked away not saying anything. She was awful, and every server that I have had since going to this bj's at least 6 times, has been terrible. I am never going back again.

Lunch Special Grilled Chicken Pasta + Caesar Salad 2. Caesar Salad + Grilled Chicken (the regular dinner size) [Take-Out] Lunch Special Grilled Chicken Pasta + Caesar Salad Pizzookie (half White Chocolate Macademia + half Chocolate Chip) Personal Sized BJ's Favorite Tastes: Grilled Chicken Pasta was mediocre. It lacked that punch of flavor; you only don't get thin strips of chicken anymore. The cut is larger than usual, probably to mask just how little you actually get now. The lettuce in the salad was lackluster too; it didn't have the crunch of freshness. The to-go orders were an utter disappointment. 1. The amount of pasta in the to-go container is SMALL; my brother even asked me if this was my leftover! Either give more pasta or downsize your to-go box (former, of course, is preferred)! 2. The pizzookie had a gaping gap in the middle of the two flavors. It did not look appetizing at all. Price: Not worth what you actually get. All of the above was already $60 (that's a lot granted we got 3 lunch special dishes). Service: Waiters weren't as attentive. It took awhile to flag them down and get our bill and change.

BJs did not disappoint! Our server was Sam G.... Nicest guy ever! Great service, friendly and perfectly attentive. The food was great... I ended up ordering a pizza instead of the potato. WARNING! Their deep dish pizza is great but every pizza comes with tomatoes piled on top with your chosen toppings. Fortunately I remembered this and ordered it without! My husband ordered some kind of jambalaya dish, my daughter had the fish and chips and my son the bacon cheeseburger. Everyone was very pleased with their meals! I tried my sons cheeseburger, it was very tasty and cooked perfectly well done, as my son had ordered. They offered me dessert (a small pizookie and ice cream) as it was my birthday,but I was stuffed from the delicious pizza so they packed it to go. It didn't last long once I got home...

Worst customer service that I have ever had at a BJ's. My guests and I hardly saw our waitress except for taking our order and bringing us our food. She never asked us how we were doing and it took forever and a day to get our bill delivered and returned. But that wasn't the worst part... THERE WAS A BUG IN MY FOOD!!!! At first I thought it was a flying bug but it still stayed there and I tried shooing it away. Disgusting! Last time I am getting the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap. The manager tried making me feel better by making me a new plate but when he brought it over, I was already disgusted by the previous plate. He then asked me if I wanted something else so I said calamari. It took another 10 mins for that to come out and by that time I was already over the whole experience. The waitress still took her sweet time, it was so miserable being served by her. The check came and I loved that the manager comped the calamari but left the shrimp lettuce wrap, you know the one WITH THE BUG IN IT! I had to wait another 5 minutes for him and when I told him he said ""Oh, I thought I took that off"". No sir, no you didn't. You obviously did not care enough to take the time to make sure everything was ok. I did not even get to express my feeling about my experience, he cut me off when I started talking. Ugh, totally disgusted by this manager, the lame waitress, just the overall vibe from this place.  Best believe that waitress did not get a tip and I for one will not come back to this location.

The head manager of this establishment does not the the meaning of customer service. We came here to celebrate a friends birthday. One of our friends who might I add is 32 years old wanted to order a drink, but he didn't have his ID. We all knew that it would be tough to order a drink but we wanted to at least try. So we spoke to the head manager and her exact words were ""no offense but you're not worth my Job."" And I'm sorry but regardless of the situation you as the head manager should never say that to a customer. Besides that we tried to have a good time. We ordered 2 large pizzas one came out so cold that the cheese wasnt even melted and the dough wasn't even cooked through and the other came out wrong, we ordered a pepperoni and pineapple pizza but it came out without pineapple. The server who was training apologized and took it back but then brought it back and they literally just sprinkled pineapple on top. It was edible but not good. We weren't going to say anything until the couple next to us pulled a handful of hair off their pizza. At this point no one could eat anymore. We asked to see the managers again and a different manager came and he was extremely accommodating and he was truly embarrassed at the quality of food that was given to us. He was extremely apologetic and he took off our two pizzas from the bill.

They also have the takeout station/cash registers in the entryway next to the door, so that can cause some traffic as well.

They have some pretty interesting architecture here that I haven't seen at other locations. It's boredline castle-like with these big stone arches inside the restaurant. See my uploaded photos for reference. They also had pictures of half naked men in the womens' bathroom...weird? Haha. Service was pretty good!

I then made reservations for 15 people for my fiancé's grad party (basic menu, nothing like what my party was) and they almost messed that up by not having the table ready and having the wrong reservation time. I was fuming! It was a surprise for him too! Luckily my friends were able to get it taken care of before I got there with my fiancé.

We came in at 9:15, ordered two Sierra mists and a salted Carmel pizookie. The only thing that didn't let us down was the pizookie and the last manager we talked to. Sierra mist was all carbonation, which I understand happens... Change the syrup, let it run, fill a glass, taste it (then.. If it's okay...), fill guests glass and return to the table. Do not let a carbonated/syrup mess go back to the guest. This is what happened to us. So we tell the waitress. With a scoff and eyeroll the waitress brought a new one... And they took 15 minutes to remove one Sierra Mist off the bill at the end. Their points program is deceiving- there's ""current"" points and ""lifetime"" points. Apparently somewhere along the line was a free pizookie that I never asked for/redeemed but had enough points for so they removed it from our ""current"" total.... So I was pretty peeved, waitress tells me how the program works, which I already understood. Her condescension was not what I needed in order to make the situation better.  The manager came over and heard about the dining event we had and removed the pizookie. So, we were out the door for $5.  I don't think we are going to let ourselves fall into this trap again.

After reading some of the reviews, my buddy and I were a little skeptical of coming. I know a bad service experience does kill the whole mood and enjoyability of our food.  We came here not knowing what to order, so she starts off with asking general questions of what we like, we simmered down, and we eventually ordered 1) seared honey lime scallops 2) Chipotle glazed salmon 3) BBQ pizza. Im more of a seafood guy and my buddy is more of a pizza burger kinda guy. Ive never let the waitress order for me which made me kinda nervous but in the end I am very glad I did. The honey lime scallops are cooked to perfection with no raw fishy smell. Same goes for the salmon and the perfect chipotle glaze. It is not too overpowering to where you cannot even taste the fish. As for the pizza, she recommended getting it slightly well done because sometimes the dough might be a little too soft for someones liking.  We started off with a beer taster and ended up washing everything down with their jeremiah red and hopstorm IPA. I tried their seasonal hoppy Scotsman, let me tell you this..I am not a fan of that beer. Its too hoppy for me. should've guessed by the name they chose for the beer baby.  Because of her recommendations and slight modifications, we had an awesome experience. Next time, we are definitely going to request for her. For someone to actually take the time of their day to suggest things and make sure you get what you really want is awesome.  The only  bad thing I have to say about this restaurant is that during the games, it is completely impossible to get seating in the bar (understandable).

Every time I come here, I feel so annoyed by the service. First of all, we get in for the lunch special at 245. The girl asks us how many, takes our name, etc but then in the middle of that turns her back to us and then starts gossiping with another worker. UMM OK? Never turns around again to tell us to take a seat or anything.  So then we are sitting in an mostly empty restaurant surrounded by workers and about 15 minutes pass before we are even seated.  We are definitely ready to order by then but NO ONE stops by for another five. He then says he'll be back. Another five minutes go by and NOTHING.  So finally we just decide to order to go. Obviously no one is going to help us. We walk away (no one ever bothered to help is) and order to go. We have to talk to three different people before we find someone willing to take our order. The guy then doesn't even know what time the lunch special ends, and then when we tell him THREE PM, he asks us what time it is so he can ""make sure"" we don't order after it ends. Wtf. I told him that we had been waiting since 245. Then The guy doesn't give us everything we ordered so we have to wait for his incompetent self to go get the rest.

We came here for dinner, and started off with fairly good service.  I will not name the server, but he was friendly and seemed on top of things at the beginning of our meal.  However, he appeared to be overwhelmed by a large table next to us, and forgot to put in out appetizer order.  We eventually received our appetizers, the avocado spring rolls and the stuffed mushrooms, which were both good.  We then had a long wait for our entrees, and when they arrived, they were incorrect; I had ordered a white pizza without tomatoes, and it arrived laden with tomatoes.  As our server did not check on us for quite some time, and they were dropped off by a runner, we didn't have any opportunity to request that they be fixed.  Other than the incorrect order, the food was fine.   We then had a long wait for the check; it was such a long wait that we decided not to order dessert.  When we received the check, we saw that our server had not put in the ""no tomatoes"" request on the pizza, so it was clearly not the fault of the kitchen staff.  Overall the food was nothing amazing, but it was decent.  The restaurant advertizes online ordering, so perhaps that is worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=320,2.96,3.12,3.224,2.6280000000000006,3.0560000000000005
191,Jennifer M.,"Vallejo, CA",2,35,2.0,1.0,2014-08-01,"Horrible service.  We were seated out on patio where only two other tables had customers, our friendly server approached us before we had a chance to look at menu, so he offered us a couple of waters while we figured out what we wanted.  He came back quickly and we told our server we were STARVING.   We said we'd put in our dinner order before even looking at drinks or appetizers.  That was the last time our server inquired about us.  We waited and waited.  All the tables filled up eventually, we are just sitting there.  Others order were taken.  Appetizers and cocktails are out.  Even customers who had our same server had delivered food while we are still sitting with now empty water glasses.   At one point, I tried to get the server's attention and got the ""just a minute"" signal while he helped other tables.  Finally, I just asked out loud if we could get some bread or anything to eat ?   So, after finishing with the other table, he walked by sharing BJ's doesn't offer bread but we could order some little bread things from menu.  We are hungry waiting a very LONG time for food we ordered before BJ's got busy.    Meanwhile, a woman finally brought out food, but not quite as ordered. (we had a detailed conversation with the waiter when ordering how we eat everything spicy). So our waiter notices the plate is missing horseradish, while walking by, saying he'll get some.  We ask for steak sauce, hot sauce, or anything spicy, This as a fast request, since it didn't arrive as ordered.  He continues to another table, takes an order.  On the way back, I ask for extra salad dressing.  He disappearing inside again.  (So we waited for him to walk by, waited while he took an order, and then caught him walking by again.  The food is already cooling down. We wait, wait, wait, wait the food gets cold.  Cold steak and potatoes, not happening. We have nothing to drink either, (on a warm August evening), so we are thirsty and hungry.   Sitting there, I now have a headache so I tell my husband I am just going to find our server inside.  I physically am feeling bad and put a credit card on his tray saying, please just bring us the check. oh and to go containers.  When I find him, our bottled steak sauce and hot sauce is on his tray with the other table's drink orders and the extra dressing I ordered. Essentially, we waited for him to go to take an order, go to a busy Friday night bar and order drinks, wait for the drinks, go to the kitchen, place an order, get our sides, rather than just provide bottled condiments so we can eat while our food is hot.  This after our order was somehow missed without so much as an explanation, refill on empty water glasses, let alone double check if we wanted cocktails ourselves, now that we've had a chance to  look at menu and ""think about it.""   So now that we see the tray, we are really pissed.  He delivers all the cocktails and sets our condiments down across the room.  I get the condiments myself, I go inside and pick up to go containers, while he is running the credit card.  He responds to this stating he wasn't sure  if we wanted the food because we looked unhappy.  Really, what about this situation made him think we weren't HUNGRY and THIRSTY. I explained yes, we are very unhappy.  We are unhappy with the service. We are thirsty and ravenous..  I point to empty water glasses and said we have been ignored this entire time, no one has checked on us.  CRAZY that he didn't get it when I was pleading for bread or anything please. Then it sinks in, he starts saying sorry, sorry, sorry. Excessively. Here's the thing...the people sitting behind us, who arrived much later than we did, who hear him saying sorry while I am saying look, we just want to leave get snarky with us.  They say it is too bad we have to behave like this.  Really, you are sipping on drinks and getting service...walk in our shoes for an hour.  Hey, ""sorry"" might have worked the first or second time there was an oversight.  But courtesy doesn't explain why we have nothing to drink and can't even get bottled condiments in less than 15 minutes, that wasn't nice for us.   The couple that walked in saying they were so hungry has to wait for everyone's cocktails, order taking, and kitchen interaction before receiving a bottle of steak sauce?  We were courteous by choosing not to skip out on the bill, no one around to notice us use the outside exit.  Now, please...let us pay for our cold bland food.  At least we have bottled water in our vehicle to ""jug a lug"" and quench our thirst.   We can drive, fix a cocktail, microwave the food, and season it quicker than waiting for a bottle of A-1 sauce in this joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=260,2.84,3.08,3.212,2.6280000000000006,2.9840000000000004

It took him forever to bring our drinks. They actually came with our appetizers. When he brought the appetizers, we didn't even have any silverware so we asked him  to bring us some. He brought us some plates but they were dirty so we asked for some new ones. He forgot about it and we had to ask another waiter. By the time they brought us the silverware and the plates, we pretty much finished eating the appetizers with our fingers because it took forever.   The fried calamari wasn't as great because more than half was tentacles which I wasn't too pleased with.  We asked for refills on our drinks on several occasions and it took FOREVER as well.  We finally ordered our food. The food came, the server brought our pizza but they never brought us the pizza stand so he just placed it flat on the table, so I had to ask for the pizza stand. Isn't it common sense to bring a pizza stand before a pizza is brought out?  Once they brought the pizza stand we attempted to grab slices but the pizza wasn't even cut right. We were standing there cutting and tearing the pizza into pieces from the pan.  Our waiter came to check on us probably like once after that.

Our  iggest issue was with the service. It took 15 minutes from when we sat down to when our server came over. If the restaurant was busy I would understand it but it was 4:00pm and not many people in the place. When the server finally came over I ordered a beer which took 15 additional minutes to get. My dad's glass was cracked and we had to flag down a runner to help us since our server was no where to be found.

269,Erik J.,"Corona, CA",10,52,1.0,2.0,2014-11-12,"I've been to this location before and am familiar with the food and atmosphere. My friends and family went here for my birthday on 10/27. We had a larger party but were able to be seated almost immediately. However, after that, the service was much less stellar. My wife and I were there with our young son and some friends for my birthday dinner. When service is slow, it's magnified when you have a small child. In this case, service was sporadic at best. It took some time for even our drinks to come out (our son's milk included). Drink refills were also troublesome. My wife and I ordered a medium pizza to split between the three of us. When it came out, the crust was soggy and undercooked (even for a deep dish pizza). It had to be taken back to spend extra time in the oven. This caused my son to become more upset as we literally had to take the food away from him and he was hungry (as were my wife and I by that point). By the time dinner was served I was at wit's end between my son's temperament (dour, but almost understandable given how long we had been there overall by that point) and the service. We ended up leaving our friends as soon as we could get the check, which was lamentable since we were there to celebrate my birthday. As we left it didn't seem like there were many people waiting to be seated, so it was harder for me to ascertain how busy the place actually was (and therefor explain the slow service), since I was mostly focused on getting my son home at that point. Overall, the place is passable at best on most nights, but on busier nights the service can crawl. The venue has bad acoustics and it can get rather loud, especially if there are sporting events being turned up on the TVs throughout the venue. It definitely has more of a loud sports bar appeal than a family restaurant. It's a shame. I love their beer and menu, but I don't think it's enough to warrant another visit for a while at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=300,3.4,3.17,3.224,2.216,3.262
88,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,5.0,2014-11-12,"When I was going to school in the area, this BJ's was my go-to location because it was the closest one to me. Even though I no longer am in the Brea area on the regular basis, this is still one of my favorite locations. Though I have experienced long-ish wait times in the past and the restaurant is noisy, the quality of my food has always been really good. And--contrary to other locations--this location always does a stellar job with my ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese."" Here's what I would recommend when it comes to BJ's. Note: This review is primarily Pizookie-based because I always get one from here! ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese"": Sometimes I just get this mac and cheese dish as an entrée. When I got it from this Brea BJ's, it was extremely cheesy and didn't disappoint. I ordered it once in the restaurant and once for take-out, but it tasted so much better when I dined in. This mac and cheese dish features Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic, and it's topped with smoked bacon bits and seasoned bread crumbs. It also comes with two, crispy pieces of garlic bread, which are perfect for dipping. I love the cheesy concoction, and I can definitely taste the garlic seasoning. The bacon bits add the perfect crunch, and the seasoned breadcrumbs also add welcomed taste and texture. I love dipping my garlic bread into the mac and cheese and spreading some of the gooey, cheesy mixture on top. Some locations don't have this dish on the small bites menu anymore, but when I last went to this location in May 2014, they still had it. I really hope they don't take it off more of the menus!   ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie.   ""Pizookie Trio"": This dessert option is great for sharing, especially if you're torn between several different Pizookies. These mini Pizookies (definitely smaller than the original; probably half the size or smaller than a regular-sized Pizookie) come with one scoop of ice cream each (your choice of flavor). You can choose one of the designated Pizookies from the menu; when I got this dish, I opted for ""Cookies 'n Cream,"" ""Triple Chocolate Made with Ghirardelli"" and ""Peanut Butter."" It was a hard decision, as I like the original ""Chocolate Chunk"" Pizookie as well, but I was completely satisfied with the different varieties. I shared this decadent dessert with my boyfriend, and we actually demolished most of it, as the mini Pizookies were definitely smaller (and so were the ice cream scoops). Would definitely recommend this if you're torn between two different Pizookies (and the problem can't be solved by getting half of one flavor and half of another in the same dish). ""Triple Chocolate Pizookie Made with Ghirardelli"": This Pizookie option is a great choice for extreme chocoholics. It features a rich chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate, and it's topped off with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream, Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. Yum! This dessert is definitely not for the faint of heart. Because I have an extreme sweet tooth, I ordered this Pizookie for myself once--the boyfriend insisted on getting a ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"" all to himself--and I was able to finish all of mine. I loved the fudgy, chocolaty cookie paired with the chocolate ice cream, and the chocolate chips added a decadent crunch to the mix. And, of course, the Ghirardelli dark chocolate SQUARES just put the perfect finishing touch on the sinfully sweet treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=160,3.4,3.19,3.228,2.612,3.274

The food and drink are excellent here, and I have nothing but good things to say about that aspect of my experience here.  However, while out with friends at this certain BJs, there was one particular waitress who clearly hates her job. And if she doesn't hate her job, she has a funny way of showing that she actually cares about the service she gives. The welcoming host walks me and my party over to a booth, and then a couple minutes later, a waitress comes by, passes out napkins as if she's in a hurry and barks to us, ""Drinks?"" No ""Hi, welcome to BJs, how are you tonight?"" No, none of that. Just abruptly and rudely: ""Drinks?"" My party and I are taken aback by this, but she continues to take our drink and food order. When our food is ready, she comes out with the plates, slaps each one in front of us, and immediately leaves. She doesn't ask if we need anything else, like a refill, salt and pepper, etc. She just departs the table without speaking a word to us, her guests and customers. About 10 or 15 minutes later, another waiter comes by and introduces himself, and explains that our previous waitress' shift was over and went home for the day. Then, we all understand. This waitress decided not to give us the light of day because she was not going to get a tip out of us anyway since her shift would be completed before we finished eating. Therefore, she didn't even TRY to give us good service .  The next waiter was fine and dandy and everything like that, but come on. If you're a waitress, you're there to give great service. That is your job, and I understand tipping is a major part of the job's pay, but we came out to have a great time and have a great dinner service. And because of her, we didn't. I only wish I remembered her name.  In conclusion, the food is great, but there are clearly some duds within their waitstaff.

My sister came down for Christmas and I hadn't seen her in a few months. She, I and her boyfriend decided to go out for dinner, and decided on BJs because it has always been a favorite.

Waited and waited, drinks arrived at a snail's pace. Again, busy probably, excused because we were talking and not caring so much.  Finally got our orders in, a lot of the time we had to flag down our waitress or another one that passed by. All the staff was friendly and efficient, that wasn't the issue.  We ordered a pizookie before the meal. We were excited to try it, after one spoonful we found a hair in it! We told the waitress, manager came back with a pizookie. They just didn't charge for the hair one but charged for another one despite this disgusting mistake. Fine.  Next, our meals arrived. My sister's plate looked pathetic. The vegetables were all overcooked and the fish was like a balloon, overcooked as well. The plate looked like it came from a back refrigerator. She didn't send it back because it already took a lifetime to get and she was afraid the fish would then be undercooked instead so she ate it anyway.  The food was bad, the service wasn't on point.

Nancy was her name. Very poor customer service. Made me wait about 10 minutes before she stepped out of the back. Didnt have a manager persona, maybe got the title by putting in her years. Definitely needs training if she is to hold this title.  i spoke to her about the incident. How an employee told me it was physically there and now its missing. I told her a hat doesnt just walk away on its own. Suggesting if its stolen it must be an internal issue. She replied ""Maybe a customer took it while we had it up here on the counter"" & i said ""or maybe it was an employee"" thats where she couldnt control herself. And replied ""our employees do not steal"" (i really liked how she said that without being sure. not everyone follows the policy.) then she said ""we keep our lost & found for 2 weeks, but we are not responsible if it goes missing"" ... Ive been in retail for years, this Manager Nancy either needs a LOT of training or a demotion. This postion should go to someone who knws how to handle this situation better.

While reviewing menu found out that the ""hand tossed"" pizza is no longer an option.  We love the deep dish but like to mix it up with hand tossed pie occasionally. The new gimmic is ""tavern cut"" pizzas which are nothing  more than a longer flat bread pizza (basically an appetizer) that doesn't fit on the pizza table rack. Our pizza wasn't cut so we had to try and cut it on the round rack with the long narrow pizza. It was a mess and all fell apart.  My first thought is they introduced this pie to cut back on dough which would add up due to the 160+ restaurants. The toppings were ok. I had a chicken pie with green chili etc. the pizza was too much work, sloppy and disappointing. Too bad because we like BJ's and most of their food. The bartenders were good and friendly until I found my bill inaccurate. Granted it was .60 off but it doesn't matter. Especially when the bartender girl told me it was mixed with someone else's bill!! What?? How much more was incorrect on this bill? I didn't check, i just wanted to leave. The bartender got pissy with me and shrugged off that it is only $.60. That is not the point young lady.  Maybe when she is my age, those $.60 mistakes will add up to a nice chunk of change.

But then we got seated and everything was fine our server Robert was nice and he got us drinks. Next we ordered an appetizer but we couldn't eat because we had no utensils and we couldn't find him or any other serve seems like he was the server for the area where we sat. Then we finally got our utensils then he asked us if we were doing okay and we said yes then our food came and after he didn't bother checking up on us.. Keep in mind he was not the person who brought out our food. So no refills or anything.. We waited a more then 30 minutes to get a hold of him for a refill I even put my cup towards the edge of the table where it was visible for him to see and get an idea that we needed refills. He was not attentive at all. When we asked for boxes he asked if we were having dessert so I ordered my dessert and I asked for a refill I got my dessert about 15 minutes later and I got my refill after I was all done with dessert and everything. He did not bother checking on us and I can just imagine the lack of device I would have received if I had been dinning in during there actual rush hour because it was pretty slow towards the time I got seated. I have came to this location on a Saturday night with a group of 10 and have gotten better service then this which was my first time at bjs and this is my second time here and I'm sad to say I won't be coming back.

The food took a very long time to come out, but it was busy inside, so the kitchen was probably just backed up. However, leaving (by then it was no longer busy inside) was another story. We ended up spending about 30 minutes waiting for the check to be processed (we had it split on four cards and wrote how much to put on each card...it took an unreasonable amount of time...I was about to go in and check with someone when she finally came back out).

I remember when this and the chain altogether was new on the scene, making a splash.  I was a huge fan unaware of any other place around home one could get what they called Deep Dish (mocking tone only because I visited Chicago for a dozen years, and that's a different animal altogether).  Initially, the pizza was a valiant effort, never as much cheese as this Midwesterner would like and would get while traveling, but still tasty, with a wonderfully ever-so-slightly burnt crust edge.  Just the right amount of oil, and lots of great tomatoes.  Ordering extra cheese has a moderate impact on the volume. Since that time, a couple things have happened, but it all boils down to the company's gotten too big for its britches and the bean counters have assumed control.  Service is slow (I've experienced this not only when dining there, but when I had a party there the space was way understaffed, so people were always waiting for something).  Wouldn't you sell more drinks and have happier people if you had a couple more servers making sure everyone who wanted something got it? It's a shame when companies forget what got them where they are in the first place, makes the field ripe for someone else to come along and sweep the rug out from under them.  The place is still busy so status quo for the office in the meantime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=200,2.24,2.77,2.976,2.252,2.5580000000000007

We the hostess (different) sat us, she just threw the menus on the table, said something around the lines of enjoy your dinner or they will be with you, and walked away before we were even sat.  I can understand this if you are really busy and short staffed, but there are plenty of workers for this not to happen. Now, we waited about 12 minutes until finally someone came to our table, our server.

I had about 6 cups of water and I never had to ask for any. The food came out in a good time, hot, and just what we ordered. Service was great and I would give that part 5 starts after the initial 12 minute wait for him.

The food has become bland, under cooked at times, but yet takes forever to get - regardless to how slow or busy it is. Customer service has been suffering too. The ladies (and occasionally dudes) at the front greet people when they come to the podium to reserve a table. And as of late, that's about the best customers get. Many of the waitresses/waiters have extremely fake attitudes, they are not very accommodating, don't know the menu, and don't really seem to care about their jobs. My last visit is a prime example of this upset. The waitress we had was slow to getting our order, got half of our orders wrong, and then disappeared for the majority of our meal. It wasn't a busy night, so I am not sure what lead her to ignore our table. None of the 6 people in my party were happy with the meal.

On Mother's Day, 2015, we took a group of ten to the BJs in Brea.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.    We were off to a good start, but things went down hill quickly!!   Several of us ordered appetizer salads, which were brought out fairly quick.  Four of us ordered Fish and Chips, a couple burger orders, a pizza, and a few other items. While we were still eating our salads.. a server brought out ONE Fish and Chips and sat it down in front one of the moms who ordered it.   She hadn't even finished her salad, so she continued to finish her salad while waiting for everyone else's food to be delivered.   Her Fish and Chips just sat...  I figured, that the rest of the food was coming for all of us.  BUT NO...    a few minutes went buy, and no food for anyone else.  After over 5 minutes, I got up and looked for the floor manager and told her that one person in our party had her food, and no one else.   Finally, after another five minutes, the rest of the orders began to trickle out.  TEN MINUTES AFTER the first Fish and Chips were delivered to the table!!   By the time she started eating her fish...  IT WAS COLD!!!   Finally, everything was deliver EXCEPT THE PIZZA!!  After all this time, everyone was finally eating except the two that order PIZZA.    The PIZZA was finally delivered after waiting over 5 minutes more.   The manager brought it out and apologized for it coming out late, and said it would be taken off the bill.   LATE????   Everyone else was ALMOST FINISHED with their meals!! On top of everything else, several of the HOT food items were actually WARM to COLD!!!   The total for the table was upwards of $200.   I guess the real bothersome issue is...   I sent an EMAIL through BJs website, and received ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE....  not even an apology for the poor service and poor quality food!!  Obviously they were NOT prepared for Mother's Day and the impact of the crowd.  SORRY, not my problem!!!   We paid good money and received POOR service and POOR food quality.   And then, not even a response from BJs Home Office!  Why do they bother to place a comments section on their website, if they don't plan on responding??   Used to be a good place to eat, not so much anymore... especially on ""special days"" like Mothers Day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=360,2.4,2.69,2.924,2.148,2.574

My son called to find out what happened, after I told him, he said the server thought it was strange that I would put no sausage, so they assumed it meant that I wanted it.  First off, never assume, second, all they needed to do was pickup the phone to verify my order, but they didn't . So now they tell my son, he has to wait 20 minutes for a new pizza.  I told him, if that is the case, they need to remake both, because the other one that is correct, will be cold.  They told my son that the correct pizza is in the warmer and that they will not make a new one and that it will be fine.  I told my son to talk with a manager, which he informed me he did ask, but one never showed up. Well, sure enough, just like I thought, the pizza they did get correct was cold and overcooked, as we all know it would be.  There was no attempt at any compensation/apology for their mistake and  for the time my son had to waste waiting for a new pizza, since they decided to guess at what I may or may not want on my pizza.  I thought that the number one rule in customer service, is the the customer is always right. It is obvious that this location doesn't believe in that, and to top it all off, the pizza's were very greasy and made my wife sick.  Last time we visit this location!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=400,2.48,2.61,2.912,2.02,2.558

I had left a little earlier than usual, around 4pm, heading out of Irvine. Looking at the traffic report, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to make it home without going crazy and yelling at all the stopped cars. Texting mi amiga Bonnie, asking if I should stop for Happy Hour or should I go, she said Happy hour! And so I stopped in Brea (it had already taken an hour to get to Brea- usual 35 mins) and wanted to do Yard House. Bonnie couldn't make it til 6 so I quickly switched to BJs since their Happy Hour is M-F 3-7pm. Going at 6, there was a line for parties that were more than 3, but since we were only a party of two, we quickly got a seat. Their happy hour is on their beers, cocktails and wines. They also have 50% mini deep dish pizzas and $2 off shareable/handcrafted appetizers.  Barefoot White Wine- Flavors of green apples and peaches with a creamy mouthfeel. Not really too much of a fan of this, because the fruitiness of the drink wasn't as strong as I had hoped for it to be. It was light and alcohol was more of a presence. Yes, that's the case, but it's my personal alcohol taste :P If you like more alcohol, go ahead and try it ($6.25/glass) BJs mini deep dish pizza- $11.50 reg. Totally not worth at that price. I think 1/2 price is a more reasonable price. 6"" pizza. It was indeed deep dish and you could taste the crunch. Plus so much more crust :3 There was a lot of cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms and toppings on there. The only thing would be that it is sooo not worth the regular price. You want wings? They got wings. They aren't dry either and they are marinated pretty well. Tangyyyyyyy. You got celery and ranch on the side as well :)  BJs is loud and boomin and will have tons of people here throughout the day- come here for Happy Hour and enjoy their beers and appetizers! :D No pictures included because  a) it was really dark- they dimmed lights around 620pm b) Phone was at like 7% battery c) Was too tired.

I've been coming here since 2007 and I will still be going back :) Pros:  -They have pretty good happy hour. -Great place to come grab a bite to eat/ catch up with friends.  -They have a pretty good selection of food variety (Even have some gluten free options.)  -They have great customer service -They have a good selection of alcohol. My personal favorite is their Berry Burst Cider #I'llHaveAnotherOne Cons:  -Service can be a little on the slower side with big parties.  -Wait time can be longer than what they tell you. (I had a reservation (for a big party) and we still ended up waiting a good amount of time before we were seated )  -Big Parties= 1 big check, they don't split the bill.  (However, They did do it for me one time when I went with 16 of my friends, our server was actually amazing! She definitely got a good tip.)  TIP: If you have a big party, make a reservation.  If you are going to decorate the table with anything (Ie: Bridal shower, Birthday etc.) Get there earlier and make sure to talk to the manager on which table they're giving you so there's no miscommunication.  ( I went in for my reservation for 25 on one occasion.The Server/Hotess showed me my table, So I set up with some table decor/gifts, only to have their manager tell me I was actually at a different table..so I had to move to another table at the other Patio (They have two Patios)..It was inconvenient to say the least.But the rest of the service was good.)

This one is specifically located inside the mall parking lot past Cheesecake Factory around the same area as Sears & Nordstroms. Parking is difficult depending on the day/night due to being in a busy mall parking lot, so if you find a spot, take it! Now onto the Restaurant. We had an extremely large party of over 25 people, but the staff certainly took care of us & really made sure we were okay across the board. Our main server wasn't too knowledgable about drinks other than the beers. I asked a question about a sangria & he was grasping for any type of lifeline to help him, as my friend interrupted & asked if they only had a blood orange flavor, which in fact they did at the time. The food however is just mediocre in my opinion. It had its highlights & lowlights. I was loved loved loved the Sriracha Brussle Sprouts, yum!! We ended up ordering two extra rounds, delicious, even if you're not a fan of Brussels. The pizza is just whatever, the toppings are what makes it. The traditional pan style is dry and you kinda have to dunk it in ranch to make it palatable despite the toppings which is a disappointment. Onto the Pizookie, well how can you go wrong with that? Par-baked cookie fresh out of the oven & ice cream, yeah its still as delicious as it used to be (I ordered the cookies & cream).  If you do have a big party like we did, tell folks to bring cash.

The tomato cheese salad and wedge are my favorite.  My husband recommends staying away from the spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce is over spiced and not in a good way (strong on the vinegar).  The smell of the spices was overwhelming.

We were lucky to have a friend in the party to regularly use their app and put in our name. We arrived, and our table was ready within 10 minutes. Definitely will download the app! We came for dessert, after visiting some food trucks down the street. We went for the pizookie of course. But my friends wanted to try some other fun desserts. Well, I went for the cookies and cream pizookie, cause I don't recall ever tasting it. It was pretty much a chocolate cookie with cookies and cream whipped cream. Wasn't anything exciting for me. Definitely would go back to either the white chocolate chip macadamia or chocolate chip next time. I wanted a little alcohol and went with the watermelon basil margarita. Bad choice. It did not mix well with the cookie. It was way too sweet and had too big of a kick. Both items I wouldn't go back to again here.  My friends went with the sampler and I tried the monkey bread and that was so much better. They also ordered the baked beignet which was covered with strawberries, it was so light and delicious. Another win for that! Unfortunately my dessert choices were far from delectable. But my friends choices balanced it out the loses and I give them a neutral rating for desserts here.  Our server Chase was pretty cool. Very attentive at first. We arrived an hour before the end of his shift. We received our check, divided up the check, and waited for his return.

After our food was delivered to us, we has another server come to say he was taking over for our original server.  It would of been nice if she would have introduced him to us.  Once he came over, our service went from good to very poor.  We asked for refills and for my son's birthday desserts.  It was awhile before we saw him again.  When we finally saw him, we asked were are refills were and he stated, he had forgotten.  When my son finally did receive his birthday dessert, he put it down, said Happy Birthday and just walked away.  We were never asked if the other people in our group wanted dessert or offered extra spoons so my son could share with his friends.  This is the second time we have celebrated my son's birthday here and both were horrible experiences.     This BJ's  is my mom's favorite place to eat for lunch.  Whenever we go for lunch the service and food have been great.

My go-to and seems like a lot of peoples go-to here is the pizza. If you like deep dish pizza then you will be fine here as the pizza is alright. Not too shabby by my books, and I love me some pizza. If you do not like deep dish then you might have some problems. I once had the none deep dish pizza and the crust tasted horrible, not my kind of thing. My fave pizza here is he BBQ chicken. Chicken, Cheese, BBQ Sauce, Onions and Cilantro with Tomato Chunks. Yummy! For dessert you have to get a Pizookie! Warm cookie (chocolate chip, peanut butter, white chocolate chip [I think]) baked in a round tin, and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Soft and creamy goodness!

Get third burger, which is sort of properly cooked, and accept that from the manager, only to realize a few minutes later that the bacon on this particular burger was so undercooked that no reasonable human being would eat it: minus one star.

91,Steffy M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",312,2,,1.0,2016-11-26,"Made a yelp specifically to complain about this place. I have gotten terrible service on several acccounts. I love BJ's, the food and atmosphere is great.  But the Brea BJ's puts all of them to shame.  In the past year I have gone to the BJ's maybe 5-6 times, and every single time I have gotten terrible service.  The first time, I ordered a MINI pizooki and it took an hour. Really??? Furthermore, the waiter was no where to be seen the entire time.  I myself, who is also a waiter at a restuarant, know how difficult it can be at times so I let it go.  The second time I came was with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday.  We ordered a large pizza and it took an hour to come out. I understand pizza takes a long time to cook, but once it came out we found a HUGE strand of hair in the sauce.  When we told the server, she awkwardly walked away (without taking the nasty pizza) and called her manager to come over. The manager asked if we wanted another pizza, but at this time we weren't hungry because everyone had already ate their food except for the people who wanted the pizza. Another time I came, the server was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We all finished our waters & had nothing to drink once the food came out because he never came back to refill our cups.  On another account, the server kept bringing waters out for us.  There were 5 people in my party, and at the end of the night there were 16 glasses. No, I am not making this up.  And they were ALL full, none of us were drinking that much water.  Why the server thought it would be smart to keep bringing out waters, I don't know. (We're in a drought- come one!) The final straw was yesterday.  I came in with a party of 8, and everything was fine until it was time to pay the check.  The server never came by to take the check, and we just sat at the table for about 30 minutes waiting for him to come back.  They also over estimate their wait times by way too much.   All in all, the food is good, but the service here is TERRIBLE.  If you're in the area, just go to the Cheesecake factory, it's right across from BJ's.   If you want good and quick service, don't come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=160,3.08,3.11,2.852,2.6280000000000006,3.098

105,Kimberly S.,"Long Beach, CA",54,9,17.0,2.0,2016-12-22,"This review is mainly based on service. It is Thursday night, 8:40pm and the restaurant is not too busy. We check in at the front as ask for a table 2. The girl said give me five minutes so we said ok and continued to stand there and wait. After a few minutes we sat down and a party of 3 came in after us. 10 minutes pass by, the party of 3 is sat. So my husband goes up again and asks when we can be seated, the girl replies with ""for how many?"" Clearly having forgot that we were there and never took our name.  A few minutes later we are seated, just about 9pm when we ordered. We just wanted a relatively simple and quick dinner so we ordered a Santa Fe salad and portobello fries as an appetizer with a peach tea and a sparkling water.  Our appetizer came to the table at 9:24. It took about 10 minutes after we finished eating the appetizer (had it cleared from the table also) until the salad came out.  The waiter was attentive with our drink refills by coming and asking when our drink was low, but it took so long for the refills to come out. We were so thirsty!  We finish the salad and order dessert. One pazookie. I think after 15 minutes he noticed we were slumped over in our seats just tired of waiting, (cause at this point it was nearly 10pm) so he came over and said let me check on the pazookie and also said I'll get you a refill as well.  Finally the pazookie came out around 10:10. Delivered by someone else who wasn't our waiter. Still no refill in sight. We finish the pazookie and he comes back and says he will get the check (and the refill) which at this point I didn't even want anymore. Finally, done with the check and left the restaurant at 10:30! We arrived at 8:40.... 2 hours of our night for an appetizer, SALAD and a fricken pazookie.  Definitely not going to eat at bjs again if it's a night we have things to do and take care of.

The waitress came back to take it back but asked him to slide the meat on a separate plate, leaving just the sides. Meanwhile, it took another 30 minutes for them to bring back out the steak. It was odd that they didn't just bring out a full meal, but rather just a slab of meat.  I had no choice but to ask for a manager who offered to compensate the meal, which was nice, although Yelp check offered buy 1 get 1 free so there was not much incentive. I explained to the manager that it was about free food so to speak but the overall experience we were having. A few other things had occurred that don't need to be mentioned.

Ordered the white peach margarita (get it on the rocks instead of slush = more alcohol!! *wink) Boyyy it was strong! It comes with frozen peaches too, which I enjoyed after finishing my drink. A must try! I love calamari, and BJ's calamari never disappoints! It was actually served out really fast, so that got me super excited. What I liked about it the most is that it  stays crispy no matter how long it has been. I remember I snuck in a last piece even after our main meal, and it still had a crunch to it! (a plus!) Also, I love calamari when it's served with the squid legs -- this choice was definitely a win! We also ordered the Spicy Pig tavern cut pizza. Yummy! It comes with pieces of jalapeno, so be careful because it gets spicy! I love spicy food and the fact that this pizza comes with pineapples (love!!) was definitely a good choice! Our server was super patient and was very nice -- even though it was obvious that we just wanted to place our order right away. lol If it wasn't for the self-seating bar area, then we would've left.

Overall the server was nice but the furniture was dirty (mystery hardened goop on my arm rest kept me from using the right side of the chair) which made us wonder whether the kitchen was clean and we can get better quality pizza closer to home with fresh ingredients for less money so we think maybe this location is just in business because people know the chain and because it's in a mall parking lot which generates a lot of business.

We had friends wanting to look at the menu more before ordering she got frustrated cuz she took half the orders and said the iPad will time out in five minutes.

Come time for the bill we waited a half hour from the time we got it to the time she brought it back to us. I had to go to the hostess where every time many servers were just hanging out. They told me the waitress had to get manager approval. The waitress told me it was hard because we split the bill. It was 3 cards and cash and we wrote the amount down for each card. Shouldn't take a half hour no matter how busy. I think if servers were assigned at tables they can handle it would benefit the restaurant.

The reason is the noise. I'm a senior, and have difficulty hearing and the noise in this place makes for a lonely meal, as I cannot hear anything said at our table due to the background noise. When it was Magnolia's Peach, there was carpeting throughout and it was much, much quieter. That's ancient history!,  BJ'd is too noisy for old folks like me. Before we sat down, I checked on the outside dining and discovered it was quiet, and the gas space heaters in the top of the awnings kept the area warm and cozy. (It was overcast and typical June gloom weather outside with a definite chill in the air but inside the tentlike enclosure, it was fine AND QUIET.) The food was good. We had Ribs, Chicken Club Sandwich, Spaghetti & Meatballs and a Mediterranean deep dish pizza. The wife had a Top Shelf Margarita on the rocks which was very good. The rest of us had soft drinks.  The dinner was topped off with Pizookie.  The best part was our table server, Judy C (#195). She is a star. We loved the way she treated us like family and took care of our every need. The lemonade, Iced tea and Sierra mist drinks were kept topped off without asking, and in a timely manner. Couldn't be happier with Judy's attitude and great service.  (Note to manager: Judy is a keeper - take good care of her.)

My daughter and I were brought salads with literally no dressing. We had to wait 10 minutes before we could find someone to ask for sides of dressing and then he still never brought any. The lettuce was wilted and awful looking. My mom has special dietary concerns so we asked for a plain baked potato but got  a tiny over-cooked rock. We tried to order her green beans (that were on the menu) but they didn't have any so we ordered a side of fruit. The side of fruit was RIDICULOUS. A teeny tiny little bowl that was half full no less! Like 3 bites of fruit... I thought it had to be a kids menu thing but no! Here's a tip- double or triple the price and make it a regular sized serving of fruit! Good lord! We also ordered the poké (we get it every time) and there were three little tiny cubes of avacado on the plate.. not even a full slice!

I waited 10 minutes and got concerned about my Husband...He appeared and was upset....they had seated him at another table?!  When he returned from the rest room, he asked where I was seated.  Three people were at the front desk and no one knew?  He accepted a seating thinking I went to the restroom since we had been on the road 3.5 hours. He was on his way to check on me and saw me seated!  10 minutes!!  As I look around I am the only single woman in the restaurant....I even received a group hug from two of the waitresses when I was seated since I was road weary. It was Happy Hour and our destination was 45 minutes away so we ordered appetizers: Chips and dip (guacamole)....the chips gleaned with grease, the dip was dark with wilted garnishes.   I got the dry ribs with saturated ribs with a side of finely chopped dry vegetables saturated in dressing .

It took a while for our appetizer to arrive and when it did we couldn't eat it because no plates were given. The kids sat there patiently staring ...drooling over the flatbread pizza. :(  We didn't see our server, so after waiting a few minutes I asked the hostess to track him down.  I guess she couldn't find him either so she ended up getting our plates. Then, before we could take a first bite our entrees arrived. That's terrible timing! Asked the server to take the food back to keep it warm at least. We rushed through our app and again sat there waiting to spot our server. Finally, I spot him, signaled that we needed him at our table and I'm pretty sure he knotted ..he was carrying a stack of dishes back to the kitchen so I assume he'd come see us right after ---especially given the timing mishap. NOPE! He went to take another table's order. Ugh!!!! That was it! We walked out.  I explained to the manager what had happened.

The offered solution: to leave and bring back the soda Xs 2. The wait: 45 minutes later my brother and his kids were still waiting, it was movie night and we didnt want to be interrupted with the delivery of soda. we called the restaurant and the delivery person was still there getting ready to leave for another delivery and will drop the soda off after.  We said forget it, take off the soda, and the wings, and the delivery fee...

We were told our party would be next to make up for the inconvenience.  Another one of the women in our team ordered chicken wings, bone in.  The amount of time it took for them to arrive was pretty long.  And when they arrived, they arrived...boneless.  We let the waiter know, so he removed them and left.  Another twenty minutes pass, and they come back with the same platter of boneless wings (now cold).  We let them know again that we wanted them bone in, and when they do arrive bone in (the third time), they were cold.  By this time we request to speak to a manager.  We then proceeded to order the rest of our food, which also took long to arrive.  A mom and pop place would have had better food for less money.  The pros would be that our waiter remained kind and courteous through the whole situation (even after we requested to speak to a manager) and the pizookie was tasty.  I would only come back here if this was the only restaurant in California, but it isn't, so...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=20,2.72,2.87,2.968,,2.8100000000000005

He was on top of everything and took care of us all night and he was such a sweetheart. Even though he was busy, he continuously came and made sure everything was ok. We laughed all night and after our week, we needed that. It was like we were old friends.  We enjoyed our food but we enjoyed Brandon even more. We'll definitely be coming back. Also shout out to Nate who I got to talk before I left! We had a short convo and he wasn't even our server but he was still nice enough to chat and ask how I was doing  =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=20,3.04,2.94,2.984,,2.9800000000000004
243,Brianna W.,"Placentia, CA",96,6,19.0,4.0,2017-12-03,"For my friend's birthday party yesterday, we went to BJ's. The buffalo boneless wing appetizers was super moist and soft on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside.            However, the lemon thyme chicken that I ate was second to none. The tenderness of the chicken with the blend of fire roasted peppers, tomatoes, sauteed red onions, and roasted Brussels sprouts over the brown rice was simply delicious. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water.       The sparkling raspberry lemonade is a definite must try. It was a bit on the sweeter side, but it was such a nice blend, not to mention, picture-worthy. A light pink color after mixing, the best time for good photos would definitely be before it's mixed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2,3.04,2.93,2.988,,2.974

There wasn't a long wait; we were seated right away. The female hostess let us know about BJ'S PREMIER REWARDS. I signed up on their website from my phone right there while waiting to order. You get a FREE MINI PIZOOKIE for downloading the app and using mobile pay. Plus, have the server check you in by scanning or entering the bar code numbers and you will start earning points that will end up saving you money on future visits. The service was phenomenal.

You need a reservation for that many people, which is absolutely understandable. It's a lot of people. So they need to speak to the manager. I held for 7 minutes, nobody comes to answer. I hang up, call back. I ask about it again, they said manager is busy. I get it, it's Saturday. I gave them my number, and ask to please have them call me.  Half an hour goes by, nothing. I need to see if I can make a res before it's too late, so I call back. I ask to speak to manager. Again, on hold for 9 minutes. Finally comes to phone, says they can't because they're booked. I don't understand why the host or hostess couldn't just look at the list of reservations for that time and tell me they couldn't fit me in. What's the point of the runaround if they're booked to begin with?  Awful impression.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2,2.84,2.92,3.004,,2.888
