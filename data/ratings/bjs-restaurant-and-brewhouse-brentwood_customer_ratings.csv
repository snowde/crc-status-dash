398,Valerie C.,"San Francisco, CA",213,137,43.0,2.0,2012-01-03,"Bar service: Four stars. Table service: ZERO! (More on that later.) Average stars earned: Two stars. First the good: Because of an hour+ wait for a table I decided to hit up the bar for a beer so as to make the waiting and subsequent small talk with my party more tolerable. Lo and behold: PYRAMID APRICOT ALE. ON DRAFT! So here I was in the middle of suburbs and the only thing getting me through this wait were two pints of beer and a feigned interest in the current football game. Both helped kill the wait time and before I knew it I was at my table. Should have stuck to the bar. On top of the wait for the table, the wait for the food was absolutely unacceptable. And when the food did come, the appetizers came out with the food, the food came before utensils, and our server was just an overall unknowledgeable, clueless mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=360,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.184,2.76
504,Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",3,18,1.0,2.0,2012-01-09,"I doubt we will give this restaurant another chance.  The first time we went there was only a month or so after they opened.  Although the food was fabulous, the service was not so great.  I thought perhaps they had new help and/or cooks. They do not take reservations but have a ""wait less"" system where one calls to set a time you and your party will be there.  I called at 4 or so and asked for my name to put on the list for 6 for a party of 4.  We arrived a little later than our friends and the place was just a madhouse. When my friend asked if we were on the wait list, she was told no. I walked in there and found a hostess and asked her what to do to find out if I was on the list and she directed me to a short line.  Thank God it was short! Anyway, I got to the desk and yes, my name WAS on the list and I was told it would be about 30 minutes but we were called within 15. That was nice.  However, it took 45 minutes to get our dinner!  All four of us were hungry and I swear I was ready to walk out of there and go to Mel's Diner (across the parking lot) and get a patty melt.  Again, our food was great but due to the slow service and the noise (get to that in a sec), we won't go back.  The acoustics in this place is a nightmare. It seems that it was purposely designed to increase the people talking.  My husband and I and our friends are all senior citizens with hearing disabilities. It was impossible to have a conversation in there. We had to yell at each other to be heard. NOTE: our waitress told the manager we were unhappy about the wait for our food.  He came to our table, apologized and said our dinner would be discounted.  It was heavily discounted and the only thing that we were charged for was hubby's beer and my friend's soup/salad.  The total came to $24!  That was very nice but as I said above, I doubt we will go back there since the wait less system is lame, the wait for the food is unacceptable and it is too noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=540,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.216,2.72

If a friend calls and wants to do something, the options in Brentwood are quite limited. So I always throw BJs out there hoping my friend would agree. And thus far, there hasn't been one friend that hasn't turned down BJs (har har). I've grown quite fond of their bar area that's well stocked with brews and the nice, courteous staff. Even the patrons are pretty nice, tipping their head as to allow the little lady to order before them. So kind.  As far as food, get the chicken lettuce wraps if you feel like being good. The sliders if you're feeling bad.

The first time we went the server seemed new; very nervous, forgot/messed up our order, & food took too long to get served. We waited over 40 mins & my mother-in-law was so upset that we cancelled our dessert order because it took too long. Yesterday we had dinner, our server was much better, but we had another over 40 minute wait. They were obviously not that busy being that it was a Tuesday night, as only a third of the tables were used. But really I don't mind waiting if the food is really great. It wasn't. It was ok. They admitted to the birthday celebrate that she was the third person who asked for ribs that night & they had none.  My husband asked for his steak well-done with no pink; surface looked burnt & a big corner was pink. I ordered the Maui pork chop, it was ok. I expected it to taste Hawaiian, just seemed like something I could cook at home. I finished my plate, nonetheless, because I was starving from a long day at work & a longer waiting at BJs. I know why they serve alcohol here, it's so you can be tipsy enough to mind the long waiting, mediocre service, & disappointing food.

BJ's makes all (except for gluten free) of their pizzas deep-dish. That serves me well because their crust is pretty good, moist, have some flavor, and not dry. I have also tried their BJ's Favorite and it was good as well. The breadth of their menu is as vast as lets say Cheesecake Factory but alas, I have only tried their pizzas.

515,Michael R.,"Antioch, CA",1,12,,1.0,2012-03-08,"I've eaten at several BJ's: san jose, walnut creek, fairfield, etc, and found them to be fairly decent, but every time i've been to the Brentwood, CA restaurant, we have a terrible time. My family went out to celebrate my birthday and we were seated immediately. Server was slow to even acknowledge us and ask us for our drink order. this is a wednesday early evening, btw, not a weekend.  Our salads come and the lettuce is the white part we typically remove and throw away, no green, yechhh. Later, everyone gets entrees except for me. I keep nursing my anemic salad waiting for my thai salmon and nothing.  waiter keeps saying, ""it'll be right up...""yadda yadda. My family finishes their meals and are getting ancy to leave when a kitchen hand arrives with a plate of jambalaya that we did not order and our waiter quicly intercepts him and directs him away from us.  FINALLY, my salmon comes and it is a bit overcooked and very dry.  No time to ask for a replacement since we need to get home, i ask waiter for some of the sauce that probably should've been included with the dish, not just in very trace amounts on the rice; this fish is hard to swallow it is so dry.  he takes off, i presume for the kitchen to get the sauce. Later, i hear him chatting with the table next to ours and give him a look like where is my sauce. i have stopped eating otherwise it'll be too late.  he takes off..returns and asks us if we want a refill.  I say, ""you're killing me, where is the sauce i asked for?!""...""oh yeah"", he says and eventually brings it and says he is going on his dinner break.  Finally we get the bill and are astonished at how expensive this mediocre meal was and leave.  before we get home, i look at the receipt and notice we were charged an extra $15.50 for a jambalaya. I now believe the little punk ordered his dinner on our bill and didnt think we would notice. I drove back and it took awhile for a manager type to make it up to the front and he credited me the $15.50.  We could've had a better time elsewhere and saved our money.

485,Karen J.,"Brentwood, CA",4,18,,4.0,2012-03-17,"Very thrilled another good restaurant was added to Brentwood. This one opened last September and seems to always be busy. We have figured out to go a bit earlier so we don't have those hour-long waits. I think the portions are fairly good sized, and while some things are pricey (like the pizza) I think it's mostly competitive. The service is really quite good. At least for us it has been. I have enjoyed the Chicken Southwest salad, a Chicken sandwich that is served with a garlic parmesan spread on the grilled bread (can't remember it's name) and the calamari appetizer is the hubby's favorite. I like the thai chicken won tons. We tried the Pazookie dessert once and it was too sweet for me, my hubby found the Beignet; fried pastry with vanilla ice cream and strawberries... he was in heaven. On the negative- it is WAY too loud in there. I worked concerts for many years so I've heard all kinds of music but when your table can't hear much of the conversation because everyone is talking over the music (which just makes the whole restaurant louder) they should really take notice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=500,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.384,2.64

395,Andrea S.,"Bend, OR",125,15,,1.0,2012-04-09,"Overall: Friends and I have given BJs another several shots. Having visited five times since my initial review, the verdict is in: BJs is a just another mass-produced culinary disappointment with a penchant for exploiting poor customer service and average corporate food. Customer Service: With the exception of one visit we made to the bar, in which our playful bartender gladly allowed us to re-name him to suite our sensibilities, each visit resulted in the return of lukewarm food, and a server who was either too busy to check on us or too green to answer questions or provide adequate service. Since my great fall on the freshly waxed floor (a Three Stooges moment that resulted in purse contents scattering and feet leaving the floor), I've spoken with the managers and staff about how staff walked over me without a second glance as I lay there. The response? ""Did you ask for help?"" My bad! I wasn't updated on accident protocol at BJs. Note to self: if ever visiting BJs again, bring Life Alert necklace in the event of another fall; that or a microphone and portable amp for announcement to staff to stop on by on their way through. Food: Got salt? The food is fair at best. Think Chilis with more seafood options. At these prices, I'd prefer to visit a local joint that's privately owned where I'm going to get real food rather than the seemingly microwave heated options with pre-packaged sauces offered here.  Beer: Still a good beer menu no matter how you slice it. My recommendation for those with a beer hankering is to sit in the bar area where the better servers seem to work. You'll probably get a better deal at Bev Mo for a lot of these, but let's face it, you don't always want to stay home. While it may not be enough of a reason for me to patronize BJs, beer lovers are not likely to be disappointed by the hoppy options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=360,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.084,2.6

491,Karen W.,"Antioch, CA",4,1,,1.0,2012-04-24,"I have never been to a Restaurant that assures such negligence with respect to how they operate their business, the fact that I'm not an isolated incident and Andrea S posted a comment on 4/9/2012 three days after I fell simply shows that BJS are not concern with the physical welfare of their customers; as a result I will never patronize this establishment ever again.  I'm truly upset and disappointed at the nonchalant attitude of the Manager Chris.  Thank you BJS for ruining my date night and my recovery after having surgery, your negligence has made my recovery more painful and frustrating.  It's taken me some time to post this comment regarding my experience at BJS Brentwood because I had wrist surgery and I haven't fully healed.  My husband decided to surprise me with date night on 4/6/2012 three weeks after my surgery. I was looking forward to getting out of the house although I had no idea where we were going.  We arrived at BJS Brentwood at 6:50 our reservation was at 7:30.  My husband and I checked in with the hostess at which time she said areyour other guest here,? Which was a surprise to me, my husband had taken the liberty to invite 2 other couples which we hadn't hung out with for a while.  Surprisingly we were able to find two seats at the bar while we waited for the other 2 couples to arrive.  We sat between to other tables; the volume in the restaurant was extremely loud.  However I was excite to be out and about with the prospect of seeing our four friends. The server came over extended pleasantries and ask if were ready to order we ordered from the Happy Hour menu, 2 appetizers a Bud light and a cocktail,15 mins later our food and drinks arrived, I took two sip from my cocktail hadn't yet touch my food and two of our friends Vanessa and Damon had arrived, they came over to where we were exchanged pleasantries, Vanessa went to ask the Hostess how long it would be for our table, just then another friend Stacey walked over to our table and we chatted for about 5 mins.  Vanessa motion to us that our table was ready, the two guest to the left of us said we are just about to leave if you want our table, I said sure thank you.  At this time Damon went to join his wife in the lobby.  Stacy took a seat right next to me to wait for her takeout order.  The two guest to our left said we are leaving shortly if you would like our seats, I said yes thank you so much, I told my husband  I'll let Damon and Vanessa know  to come back to the bar we would be more comfortable rather then have a booth. Case in point:  I made my way through the lobby to the table where Damon and Vanessa had just been seated, I said hey we just got 2 other tables in between us at the bar, lets just sit there; they were rather happy; more room, more space, plus Happy Hour prices.  I turned to walked away a few ft and bang I FELL REALLY HARD ON THE SLIPPERY WAXED HARD WOOD FLOORS; I tried to get up 3 times and kept slipping, I couldn't get any traction, Damon (a few ft behind me) rushed over and tried to help me up, the staff walk all over me and said nothing, next thing I saw our other two guest Kennan an Gina hurrying from the lobby with my husband franticly trailing behind them. I could see and hear the laughter within the dining room. Damon and my husband hoisted me up under my arm pits from the floor OMG babe are you ok?  I couldn't answer fast enough, as I tried to stand I felt the pain in my left knee throbbing; I said honey it hurts when I stand on my left knee, they assisted me over to the table in the Bar.  Reka our server seemed very concern she said OMG are you ok I'm so sorry, I couldn't speak, I'll get a Manager, the volume and the commotion at table was loud everyone was trying to make sure I was ok, my husband looked worried and was really up set, he said I was watching you walk back towards me and next thing I didn't see you, it was like you slip on a banana peel or something.   Manager: About a min or so Chris came to the table identified himself are you ok, I said I fell really hard 4 times, I don't know my left knee is throbbing, Stacy, Vanessa and Damon chimed in those floors are really slippery, (Vanessa I slip when the hostess was walking my husband & I to our table, if I hadn't grabbed onto the hostess that would have been me on the floor, Stacy I've been here several times and I almost slip on those HW floors.  Manager I'm sorry Mrs. Wright can I get you anything, call and Ambulance I said no I don't want to be more humiliated anymore than I already have been, He said have you had anything to drink, I said no we just sat down 15 mines ago, I took 1 or 2 sip from my cocktail its still full, the two guest to the right said they just got their food drinks, We have been here before and I have seen other people slip on those HW Floors.  I said to the Manager I'm not an isolated incident (no reply) those floors are very slippery.  He said can I get you some ice, yes please, msg cont:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=500,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.052,2.52

The take-out girl left one of the sandwiches in the heater but luckily I double checked everything before driving off and was able to go back in and recover the missing sandwich. So checking to make sure you have everything is logical but I didn't think of checking to make sure the portion size was correct. I should have taken photos because it was unbelievable how tiny the thai chicken mango salad and chicken a la fresca were! The salad was literally a handful of greens and 3 slices of chicken! Plus the other stuff it comes with but it was amazing how cheap they were on the greens and chicken. The chicken a la fresca was 4 slices of chicken (less than half a chicken breast), skimpy on the vegetables, heavy on the rice, no sauce and no arugula salad mix on top.

387,Theresa F.,"Anaheim, CA",28,64,9.0,3.0,2012-06-03,"I think the excitement and buzz over the brand new restaurant in town as now subsided. That also means that the staff at BJ's' should have their best practices conquered by now. I think as with any large chain restaurant your experience is largely dependent on your server, the kitchen staff and how busy it is or is not when you opt to dine there.  We are not strangers to BJ's as they are all over Southern California. We have gone to breakfast, lunch and dinner numerous times since they have opened.   We have only had two really bad experiences and in both cases, the on-staff manager was able to quickly resolve the issues. On one occasion after he took quick action to resolve our problem (dead fly wrapped in a  cob web in the napkin with the new silverware), it appeared he would have to spend more time adjusting the attitude of our server. On another occasion, though our server was still fairly new, it was very quite obvious that my fiancee and I would receive our food but it was going to be a loooong process and wait. When the food did come out, only my fiancee's came but not mine. About 10 minutes later mine came out and the restaurant removed it from our bill. My two long standing complaints with this restaurant and staff is this: 1.  I am not sure why it's a battle to have bread brought out with a meal upon request. Charge me for it. I don't care just do not cop an attitude. 2.  When I order the Spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, why is the sauce never consistent? If I am ordering the dish, I need the sauce too. That means more than 3 tablespoons should be a requirement for this dish. Every single time, this is a battle to get this right. By the way, marinara sauce is NOT spicy tomato sauce. Again, I do believe it's all dependent who the server is, kitchen staff and how busy but remember we are the paying customer. That means you do not have to agree with us but you need to work with us to ensure our satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=360,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.1239999999999997,2.52

It looked and tasted like it was the other side of a half rack that was ordered several hours ago and kept under the warmer waiting for someone to order the other half.    It was served on a plate the same size as they use for mini pizzas so I couldn't open the baked potato without it falling off the plate onto the table.  The waiter didn't bring me a rib cutting knife so had to wait 5 minutes and watch everyone eat until he brought one.   The ribs were dry and hard with the sauce baked on -  probably from being under a warmer.  (And I asked for no sauce.)

Pizza took forever, waitress didn't look like she knew what she was doing, it was the saddest deep dish I ever ate, and the management came out and tried to sell us on how they make their pizza's. An experience that made me never want to come back again. Fast forward a year and my son asks to go eat there to get their happy face fries... so we gave it another shot. Round 2: This time around was much better, not best, but better (jumnped 1 star up to 3). We were seated in a timely manner and the service was really good. We were informed of the special (dinner for 2 for $20) which fit exactly what we wanted to get. Ordered a medium deep dish (same as last time) and the included salad and pizzookie. Okay, now I know that when I want a real deep dish pizza, go to UNO's. Other than that the experience was good. We ended getting a large pizza at no extra charge and had some food for our dinner the next day. The kids loved the experience and the layout of the place is nice and clean. We will definitely go back again for our family dinners but will take a stab at the entree's next time around and avoid the pizza.

319,Lukey D.,"Oakley, CA",7,74,84.0,2.0,2012-08-14,"Each time I have been to BJ's regardless of the location, I have always been consistently pleased. Well, should I say until they built the Brentwood location in my neck of the woods. The place is always hopping and there is always a wait. Their call-ahead service makes that more tolerable though. Their food is all very tasty and tastes consistent from location to location. I can say the same for their libations as well. What is lacking in this location is the service. On the fourvisits I have made there, they have done the following: Visit #1: Forgot one of the entrees. (no, I really didn't need to eat. I just came to stare at others hungrily whilst they dined). My dish came after everyone else at the table finished and they in turn had to sit there and watch me eat. Visit #2: (it's the avocado issue again) The item I wanted clearly came with avocado. So I told the perfectly communicating server that I was allergic to avocado but that I wanted the dish with no avocado. She said no problem. The dish came with avocado, I sent it back to be redone. It came back a little too quickly. I come to find that they simply took it off and there was still a green smear on the food where it once was. Visit #3: Told the server upon arrival that it was my Brother's birthday, so that they would do their birthday thing and give him a birthday pazookie. She agreed. That never happened, no apology, nada. Visit #4: We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The entrees came out quite quickly and we thought they had just beat the appetizer. Waited, waited, no appetizer. When we questioned the server she stated that she would have it removed from the bill and that it appeared we had enough to eat on the table presently. No complaints about the food, drinks or anything else. Nor about any other location except this one. The servers in this location have been consistently bad. The tasty dishes and experiences at other locations are why they get two stars and not the minimum to write.

Last night 9/8/12 we went in around 9PM. It was nice that we were seated right away with no wait. Took quite some time to get drinks and orders in. The waitress did not want to wait for us to order and insisted on coming back. Keeping in mind a deaf friend was with us and may take an extra minute to order and verify. She was not having this. So eventually we ordered our drinks and appetizer. A little while later she takes the dinner order. Twenty minutes later dinner comes out. We were somewhat surprised as the appetizer had not arrived.... we figured she never put it in. Half way through our meal the appetizer comes out. Keeping in mind it was simple chips and spinach dip..... The chips and dip was HOT. It had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The dip was so hot it started to crust on the sides of the dish and was too hot to eat. Add that to the lack of refills and it just made for a less than stellar experience for the price.

On 10/02/2012 , Me and my sister and brothers went to eat at Bj's to celebrate after playing bingo. We were greeted by an extremely nice hostess that took us right away to our table. She chatted with us for a few minutes and left us with menus. That is where the service ""STOPPED"". We waited some time not knowing who our server was because no one came to the table for quite sometime. ( mind you we were the only table in the section) after about 10 min the waitress appeared out of no where to take our drink order. She seemed stressed out and short with words. No apology for the wait. After 20 more minutes of waiting for (just beer) no fancy drinks she popped up again and began to set the drinks down so hard beer was spilling. She walked away with out asking if we were ready to order. Going on 30+ mins already 2 more party's were set in her section.  She immediately helped them taking drink orders. My sister had to shout to her that we were ready to order. She ""sighed"" loudly and came to our table. She took the order and we asked to order more drinks and she said ill be right back. She never came back. My boyfriend and brother had to get up and go to the bar and order the second round or drinks... ""ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE"" .

Wait to get seated was non-existent but the wait for food was very long. I ordered a Thai Chicken Mango Salad, gourmet mac n cheese, and a cookies n cream pazookie. My parents got the Maui mahi mahi or whatever.  Mac n Cheese was way too salty. I thought it was just the bread crumbs but it was the entire thing. I had to send it back. The mahi mahi was good. Not enough for two people in my opinion but my parents shared it. My salad was really tasty. Not too heavy. The grilled chicken pieces were a little dry and not too plentiful but it was okay. I wish there had been more chip crisp things because I like the texture. The pazookie was delicious. I've never had the cookies n cream one before. Basically an oreo pazookie. So good. I didn't think the mousse they topped it off with was necessary. I think it made it taste too sweet and didn't go well with the ice cream.  Oh and I had a peach iced tea.

No restaurant should make their customers wait that long! I went up to complain to the hostess and asked to see a manager, and she assured me that she would come to our table. But of course, timing is not their thing and I had to wait it out until the same hostess passed by my table and AGAIN I had to ask to see the manager. Mind you, the food is still not here. I hear the hostess talking to our waitress and the waitress says ""I'm not sure, it should be ready by now, I'll have to go check."" ... it should be ready by now is an understatement. By the time the food came it was cold and had obviously been sitting around for the waitress for some time, and the presentation was completely off. Fyi, if you order something one day and get the same thing the next, chances are it won't be the same. This is called spotty service, or hit or miss. Finally the manager came by and apologized and she said she would take one of the dishes off the check, and when I got the check shortly after nothing was taken off. Never coming here again, and am going to tell all my friends the same. It's a shame because I really wanted to try one of their desserts.

The first time I went to BJ's was about a month after it just opened and I had a $50 gift certificate for the place. I went with a friend and we were seated immediately on a very busy night. Now, our waiter was a bit pushy and didn't even let us look at the menu for longer than 2 minutes before he asked us what we wanted to drink. In my head I was like, ""Dude. You have a 4 page drink menu. This is going to take a while."" but I ended up just ordering a water because I felt so hurried. After we got our drinks, the customer service flowed better and the food I had was excellent. I had a jalapeno burger with avocados and my friend had an assortment of seafood options. We also shared an appetizer and had red velvet pizookies between us for dessert. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I'm going to eat with my family and it's about 6:30pm. It took our waiter 15 minutes to even ask us what our drink were, an addition 10 minutes to get us our drinks which was just 2 waters and a Midori sour. Then we waited another 10 minutes to order our food. And get this, we waited 55 minutes to get 1 pizza. 1 large pizza took 55 minutes and everyone around us who came in after us was getting served by her. Except us. Now, I've been to pizza joints where I got quicker service than this. After we ate our pizza we waited even longer to just get our check. I think we left the place at around 8:30/9 which is unacceptable considering we were there so early and that we ate very quickly because we just wanted to leave at that point.

420,Amanda M.,"Brentwood, CA",9,2,,1.0,2013-01-05,"Wow. I have had the most awful week dealing with BJs. I was having lunch with my husband on new years eve when I went to go put my Iphone in my purse. However the Iphone slips off of my purse and into this small space between the booth and the wall. the space is about half an inch wider than my Iphone and it quickly becomes clear that it is stuck deep between the booth and the wall.  We tell our waiter what has happened and he reassures us that he will be informing a manager. The manager doesn't come until nearly a half an hour later and gives us a bent ladle to try and get the phone out of the space. He helps us for a short time and then is off doing manager things, Meanwhile, my husband is using all sorts of tools to try and pull my phone out of the small space but to no avail. On his last try he had the cellphone pinned between make shift tongs he had made out of two knives and he nearly had it out of the space when it slips from his grip, and disappears into the wall.  My husband and i spent an hour trying to get my phone out of the booth, only to have it slip further. So my phone was stuck in a wall. The manager apologizes, takes down my husbands number and assures us he will get back to us.  THREE DAYS LATER, it is decided that the booth will be cut open and my cell phone will be taken out. I understood, but was having a very hard time being without my cellphone for three days, but i figured one more day wouldn't hurt.  I return on the fourth day, when the phone was supposed to be ready and speak to a manager Ivan. Ivan quickly walks up to  me and says, ""well we have cut open the wall, and your phone was not there, and there is no hole."" He takes me over to the booth that they had cut open and reassembled only for it to be THE WRONG BOOTH! I told him that my phone was in fact in the next booth, to which he said, ""oh...uh.... we cut that one too."" Then Ivan has the nerve to say to me, ""maybe you left your phone somewhere else and just thought you left it here."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!! His superior, Rich, comes out and is flabbergasted that they opened the wrong booth, and Ivan tells Rich that they didn't in fact open my booth. So Ivan lied straight to my face about my booth being open and insulted me saying that I just ""forgot"" where my phone was. They decided to call the crew to come out again to cut the correct booth saying that it would be ready by tomorrow (Day 5 for those of you keeping track at home.) So I arrive on the final day. My phone is ready and I didn't get to even talk to the manager or get an apology or jack @#%$%. I am happy to have my phone ready, but i am furious with how I was treated and I will NEVER be returning to BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=420,2.64,2.53,2.53,2.18,2.574

Then to add insult, they serve me my salad 50 minutes post ordering and 1 minute later, served my entre. So now I have to mow through my salad so my dinner doesn't go cold. No such luck. My beautiful Mahi Mahi was ice cold. Then to top that off, the kitchen expediter took the liberty to add seracha chili to my meal. Thanks a heap. If it's not on the menu, do not put it on my meal!!! I didn't complain while there since I'm tired of having sections of my meal comped. Just get it right the first time and I will gladly pay the bill with tip at the end. Comping my meal means I didn't have an enjoyable time.  Corporate really needs to look long and hard at the manager of this one store. I've met the unkempt bed and now I know why this place is in trouble. If your manager can't take the time to dress appropriately for his rank, how can he run a successful kitchen? This time for sure, I will not be back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=420,2.6,2.52,2.52,2.436,2.552

Okay, maybe not the cleanliness/overall look of the place, but everything else is just so bad that I don't even care about how the place looks. The food is bland. They're always messing up orders. The prices are sky high for tiny portions. The (alcoholic) drinks have way, WAY too much ice. You're basically paying for a cup of ice. The wait for the food is outrageous.

490,Byron D.,"Concord, CA",0,9,,1.0,2013-03-11,"My wife and I went to BJ's in Brentwood yesterday, Sunday March 10 for lunch.  My wife and I have been to 6-7 different BJ's, but this was the first time at the Brentwood restaurant.  I have always liked BJ's for their food and especially their beer.  Piranha Pale Ale is my favorite.  My wife ordered a lemon drop martini with Absolute Citron Vodka and I ordered my usual Piranha.  A long time passes before our waitress came back to tell us that they were having a hard time finding the Vodka my wife preferred.  In  the mean time, my Piranha was served and it was warm!!!  I immediately told the waitress that it wasn't drinkable and sent it back.  The manager did come to the table to inform me that the glycol chiller for all the beers on tap had been broken all weekend.  He went on to say that all his waitstaff was instructed to inform their guests of this fact.  The waitress never mentioned this to me and in fact, when she came back to tell me about the problem with the glycol chiller, she had no idea what it was and couldn't even pronounce it correctly.  So, obviously the manager hadn't told at least my waitress that beer would be served warm.  Had I known that the beer would be served warm, we wouldn't have ordered anything, we would have left.      My wife's drink finally did arrive.  I drank water while we ate a flatbread pizza.  The part that really burns by backside, is that BJ's is a brewery and for them to serve warm beer is totally unacceptable.  I know there are refrigeration techs that work on call just for this reason and to be told that the unit had been out all weekend and couldn't be repaired is a bunch of bunk!!!  The manager made no attempt to comp anything about our meal or try to appease my total disappointment. He really didn't seem to care.  More like an ""Oh well"" attitude.  Don't think I'll be going back to that BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=500,2.48,2.52,2.52,2.468,2.504

309,Amber G.,"Concord, CA",107,132,136.0,3.0,2013-04-03,"Just a tip: Alicia is the best waitress there. If you ask to get seated in her section and there's any problems, she'll more than make it up for you. I'd gotten her a few times last year and saw her again last night and she's still super accommodating.  One more tip: The BEST time to eat here is when they're doing they're two for $20 deal. I like their FB page so I could see when it's going on. You and another person both get soup or salad, a medium pizza, and a pizookie for the price of just the pizza itself. That's the best time to try this place out and basically the only time I come. Oh, ok, one more tip: You can customize your selections... a lot. If you're torn between two pizzas, you can order half of one and half of the other. If you get a nice waitress, they will often let you switch out one of their gourmet sodas so you can try multiple ones for the same price. You can even do half a pizookie of one flavor and half of another, change the ice cream, and apparently even add hot fudge underneath for no charge.  The service is really hit and miss, but the food is pretty good. Unfortunately, they don't have my favorite pizza anymore (the Balsamic Portabello Pizza... omg), but they still have a few good things to get.  Tried the chicken bacon ranch yesterday and I really liked it - my husband and I both don't get a lot of ranch anything, but it was really well balanced. The Mediterranean pizza is good if you like those flavors. The buffalo chicken can be really good or just meh depending on how much sauce they put on. You can ask for light or heavy sauce and they will comply. I actually love the Cheeseburger pizza which is weird, because I was so resistant to try it. I get it with no pickles. The only pizzas I don't like are their more traditional fare - you can get a better meat and combination pizza somewhere else, for sure.  The specialty pizzas are the way to go. BUT, some days they are better than others. This place has a lot of inconsistencies in cooks. Tried the new raspberry nut pizookie - yum! I love the red velvet and the chocolate pizookie, and this now goes in my top three. Weirdly tastes a bit like raspberry muffins, but in a good way.  If you like broccoli cheddar soup, I think they have the best in town. Go Sunday-Tuesday and try it. SO good. That's my favorite thing on the menu. The apps are a bit expensive for the portions (although I love the avacado egg rolls, I never get them), but the small bites are really good money-savers. You can get a pretty big, yummy bowl of fancy mac and cheese for a few bucks. If you're on the cheap, it's not a bad bet.  I would suggest not ordering a drink here since their portions are small and my friends that have ordered drinks have had a lot of complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=320,2.52,2.54,2.54,2.732,2.532

Now the manager comes to our table and apologizes profusely.  He says he is going to make it ""right.""  Another 20 to 30 minutes for the food.  It was hot this time but there was no flavor and the presentation was bland at best.

495,Wellie T.,"Brentwood, CA",45,14,,2.0,2013-06-14,"Five of us went to BJ's to celebrate my daughter's 19th birthday this past Thursday. We called and got on the call-ahead list. Arrived at the restaurant and then waited 45 minutes to be seated. There were lots of empty tables around the restaurant. Our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later to take our drink and app orders. Then, we waited 45 minutes for the drinks to arrive and the drinks were wrong. One person ordered a Pepsi with no ice. The person who ordered a black cherry soda received their drink with no ice, as did the person who ordered the Pepsi. Another person in our party ordered regular lemonade but received a strawberry lemonade that she described as ""chunky"". I personally ordered a Diet Pepsi, which I normally drink on a regular basis. It was flat and tasted like expired Diet Coke. We didn't see our waiter again until our dinners arrived, about half an our later, with our appetizers. Appetizers should come out before any main course is served. Everything came out together. There are RAVE reviews about the avocado rolls but ours were super bland and were literally avocados inside a roll. No sun-dried tomatoes, no pine nuts, no cilantro (except the pinch that was dribbled on the plate). Blech! I ordered the chicken wontons buffalo style (which comes with celery sticks and bleu cheese) and it didn't come with celery sticks or bleu cheese. We also ordered the mushrooms and the reason I gave two stars was for the mushrooms. They were phenomenal. They were the only thing that was phenomenal or had any taste at all. For my entree, I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with Cajun shrimp. I've never tasted a more bland salad in my life. I was sitting there looking right at the shrimp, half of which seemed to be slathered in seasoning and the other half completely void of seasoning. Despite the apparent over seasoning of some of the shrimp, there was no kick, spice or taste to any of it. If you're going to name something ""Cajun"" it better have some spice to it! My daughter had the Reuben which she did like...but she is also a french fry addict and after a handful said they were the worst fries ever and didn't eat anymore. We ordered pizookies for dessert and again, the waiter got our orders wrong. The pizookies were good...you can't really go wrong with ice-cream on top of a cookie...but we all ordered different ones and the wrong ones were brought out. Every time he got something wrong (I lost count) I didn't say anything because it had taken so long to get anything to begin with, I could only imagine if he'd had to correct something. We'd probably still be sitting there. The kicker was that I told our waiter it was my daughter's birthday and I don't know if they don't do anything for birthdays there, but he brought out her pizookie with a candle on it and that was it. Big freaking whoop. All that aside, and the waiter screwing up our orders, etc. the reason I won't go here again is because the food is total crap. Boring, cold, bland, unseasoned, and just all together tasteless. I am actually writing this review the next afternoon because I took most of my salad home to have for lunch today. I honestly thought that maybe I was just having a bad taste bud night (LOL) and gave the salad another shot this afternoon. Nope. Nothing. I honestly feel like I just ate soggy cardboard. I will say though, in comparison to most other places, they give you a TON of shrimp...which would be completely awesome if it had tasted like anything.

She came back in yes a few minutes and we just did a quick pick since she was rushing us. When we ordered she then said OK just to let you know the kitchen closes at so and so time so if you want to put in other orders you do so at this time. We barely knew what we wanted to begin with. What made me and my friends mad was the fact that when we were eating she kept coming up to our table looking at our plates to see if we were finished, and once I ate pretty much the last grain of rice she took it from the table already. I understand it's getting late and you're closing but technically they still had 10 minutes left till closing.

What kind of atrocity is that to a poor old Pizza? The service was primitive. Our waiter acted like bringing water, bread and our food was something she never had anticipated doing on her job of two weeks duration according to her boss. We waited an hour for food, requests for fries took 30 minutes, a salad took an hour and the worst food atrocity in my estimation was the half baked and weird hand tossed thing called a pizza which even the manager said was sorry!

Another one had tilapia off the light menu. She said it was very good but it was also a very small portion. I ordered a dinner salad and it was really sad. All it was, was some chopped up head lettuce and a few croutons. I actually sent it back because I hate head lettuce. I expected for the price it would be a nice mixed green salad with Possibly some tomato, cucumber or other veggies on it. Overall the food is pretty good though. the only thing  really unpleasant was the noise level in this restaurant.

So we asked for a booster seat.

That took another 10 minutes . We finally order food.  Our entrees come out first. WTH? We have no silverware, no booster for the baby, no apps, no kids pizza or applesauce (which we ordered right off the bat). I had to ask more than once for the manager. She is apologetic and gets things under control. She took the apps off because they were useless and gave us a free pizookie. That was nice and all but really didn't make up for that whole disaster.  At least the food was pretty good. Or maybe I thought so because I was so darn hungry by the time I ate. The white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie was to die for.

Wedge salad was OK. (For those that enjoy Outback Steakhouse's wedge salad- Outback's is better.  I think it's the Balsamic Glaze they put on top that makes the difference.  The rib-eye was not very good.  I always eat my steaks medium rare and this cut had some rubbery fat and wasn't very tender. The Pazookie is always tasty.  It's a slightly undercooked cookie (just the way my wife loves cookies) and some ice cream melting on top.  Delicious. I also enjoyed the draft Root Beer.  For those that enjoy a good Draft Root Beer this was very tasty and had endless refills.

231,Flora L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,12,,2.0,2014-01-05,"If you're looking for a nice place to dine, stay clear from this particular BJ's, as a word of advice. There's nothing too spectacular about it (the food or the service), and the amount of cons heavily outweigh the pros of going there. It takes, at the least, 30-40 minutes for the food to actually make it to your table - and in most circumstances, that's just for your appetizer. Then when (and if) your entree gets to you, literally anything that gets put onto the grill/stovetop is slathered in oil and, ultimately, unappetizing (which should be expected, as the presentation of their food is also usually very unappealing). The last time I went there, I was with a medium-sized party. Waited and waited and waited for my California Burger, even as those around me (who ordered steaks and such that seem like they would take longer to make than my burger) began to get their orders. Everyone was served except myself; called over the waiter, and mentioned that I hadn't gotten my order yet. The waiter checked into the kitchen and apparently the chef had either overlooked, hadn't gotten, or had forgotten about my order and it was only THEN had he started on it. Basically, was already 40-45 minutes in, and no food. The only good thing I suppose about that was that a manager who was checking in on all the tables came over and we told her about it. She apologized, and took the charge of it off our bill and a free Pizookie. A free California Burger would've been amazing (despite the fact I waited nearly an hour for it), if not for the fact that the burger was unappetizing. Could only eat half as the whole thing was just so oily and mushy. At least the wedges were good...

Bar service was really good, at times, but the food made up for it. I had the Chipotle Salmon and it was cooked perfectly. Couscous and asparagus was as well done. Lastly, I got to check out the decor and woodwork on the way out so appreciate it if you get the chance.  I forgot to mention that the reason I almost passed it up was the Yelp stars.

We checked out the menu online and although it wasn't full of options, it was good enough to try.  We came shorty after 10am which was nice since it was still very slow. We sat in the open bar seating in a booth and ordered mimosas (which weren't that great even though the appearance was nice). Our food was brought out fairly quickly, but we didn't have any ketchup, butter, jams or anything for our breakfast entrees. We kept trying to get someone's attention and after 5-10 min our waitress (who I think was our waitress) came by so we could ask. It took another 5 min or so for someone in the back to bring us those things and by then our meal was cold. No one ever came back to check on us and we weren't offered another drink or refills until after we asked for our check to leave.  The workers were all huddled at the bar the whole time. Looked like they were arguing about something but either way, we felt the overall service was horrible. I was really disappointed since I never have a bad experience or meal at BJs.

187,Gustavo A.,"Emeryville, CA",269,82,23.0,3.0,2014-10-09,So I love Bjs. It's one of the best corporate restaurants out there. They always chose great locations and their food is amazing. I usually don't do reviews for a corporate restaurant but maybe the managers need to know that this place gives inadequate service.  I've been here plenty of times. As well as other Bjs state wide in California. And for me being in the hospitality/catering/restaurant business I tend to not judge but I also notice the small things. 90% of the time I have visited this location I end up waiting for more than expected. It's also a task just to get a hold of your server. Over all the place is great just like any other Bjs restaurants but the service here shows and makes this location an unpleasant experience. Haven't been in about half a year so I really hope they have improved.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=200,2.68,2.33,2.472,2.668,2.47

But other than this, we really enjoyed our food and service.  I had the guy big bite burger with the pretzel bun, delicious.  My husband had the ahi tuna burger, which he said was delicious. My daughter had the veggie pesto pasta, which was very good.  And lastly my son had the chicken tenders which were good.  We also really enjoyed the artichoke heart appetizer, but you must order a side of the garlic dip, so yummy!  Lastly we had desert which was the mint pie and the snickers pie, they were also very good.  So overall we had a pretty good dinner.  Kinda pricey, but I would go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=300,2.76,2.4,2.5,2.6079999999999997,2.544
182,D N.,"Alto, NM",29,22,11.0,2.0,2014-12-06,"The only reason for 2 stars tonight was the service, and maybe the not-so-cold beer. I've been here several times and the food is always good, and tonight was no exception! We ordered two appetizers, the fried artichokes served with a chipotle aioli, which my wife loved, and the corn fritters which I loved. The fritters were perfectly textured! My wife ordered the California chicken flatbread pizza, and enjoyed it's delicious simplicity. I had the jalapeño burger. The jalapeños were crispy fried, which gave it a nice crunchy texture, inside that juicy burger. Very good..!! That was the ""center"" of our experience tonight. The ""beginning"" and the ""end"" is where the two stars came from. After being seated, no one approached our table for some time. In fact, it wasn't even our server who finally took our drink order, it was some other server filling in for our station's server, who was too busy to even notice us. When she did come to take our drink order, we already knew which appetizers and entrée's we wanted to order, which can be challenging at BJ's, because of their extensive menu!  I ordered my favorite beer there, the Nutty Brunette, and my wife ordered her standard lemonade. My beer wasn't very cold when it arrived, which in my opinion is just wrong! It's a brewhouse for crying out loud, and beer should be served icy cold!  When our entrée's arrived, no one came back to ask if we needed anything, at all, until it was too late that is. I like mayo on my burger and it was not served with mayo. After waiting a few minutes, trying to flag someone down for mayo, I ended up using the chipotle aioli that came with the fried artichokes, on my burger, and it made the burger even more outstanding, so when someone finally came by to see if we needed anything, we didn't.  When our server came to ask if we wanted dessert, we said no thanks, but did ask for an ice water for me and a refill on my wife's lemonade. It didn't come. I thought she forgot about us. We didn't see her anywhere! Seriously, 15 minutes later we finally flagged down another server and asked if she could find our server, and tell her we would like to get our check.  A few minutes later, here comes our server with a huge tray of drinks, which included ours that we no longer wanted. After dropping off our drinks, she gave us our check, just as I handed it back with my credit card in it. Obviously, we were ready to leave! Rather than running my credit card immediately after emptying the rest of her drink tray, she stops at a table of 8 to take their dinner order first. Big mistake!  At this point, her tip has been compromised. No matter how good the food is, when the service is this bad, there's no excuse. Yes, it was 6pm on a Saturday night, but a person shouldn't have to wait for a Wednesday to go out to dinner just to get good service, in my opinion.  Hey, BJ's!.....Here's my two cents: Staff your restaurant sufficiently on a busy weekend dinner service, or next week maybe I'll just go to Mel's....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=200,2.8,2.41,2.488,2.44,2.5660000000000003

We ended up sitting at the bar area. It took 15 minutes for someone to a knowledge that we even were here. Even though there were waitresses and waiters walking by us. Even the manager walked by to talk to a table and didn't acknowledge other guests. So a server came by named fadie. He stated he would get us menus and be right back. Yeah that was a joke. He never got the menus. My wife had to get up and get them on her own from the front. So we started to look at the menu and decided we needed drinks. No waitress or that server around so my wife got up again and went to the bar. She asked for a beer and water. The bartender had an attitude with her because we were at the table.  Finally fadie came to the table and was how can I help you. I see you got menus. No shit. You could help us by treating us like customers. I told him that he could help us since we got our own menu that you promised and our own drinks. I even told him if he was really going to help or do we need the manager to help us. He took our order at 1022 pm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=440,2.92,2.64,2.532,2.116,2.7520000000000002

We were there to celebrate my friends birthday who was here from out of state. The whole experience was ruined as was her special dinner. So I did send a complaint email to corporate. I must say within minutes I received a phone call from Kyle (regional manager) who was so pleasant to speak with. He listened to my whole adventure and we talked about a lot of things that needed improvement. He in turn phoned my friend ( the birthday girl) apologized and invited our in tire group back at another date to retry their restaurant on them! Tonight we went there . We were greeted by Melissa (general manager) who watched over our entire table. She was pleasant and caring. All of the servers that helped us were on top of their game tonight.

The food leaves something to be desired, if its even made correctly. I have never once had my food come back the way that I ordered it. I am NOT a difficult person, & I do not ask for a lot of things to be excluded or added to my meal. Generally I try to find things that I am able to eat without doing any substitutions. I am allergic to a few items that can cause a serious reaction. I try to stay away from those types of foods because I do know that sometimes accidents happen. With that being said, I had ordered some sort of chicken sandwich that avocado on it. I requested that the avocado be left off. When the food was delivered my sandwich ended up having avocado on it. I sent it back and requested that the avocado and the top bun be removed As I am highly allergic to avocados. 10 minutes later my sandwich returned without avocado. When I lifted the bun I noticed that all they did with take the avocado off and left the bun that was saturated with creamy avocado paste. I tried to flag our server down several times and was not successful until the end of the meal. I ended up not eating and placing the sandwich into a to go container which I inevitably threw away. The other thing that really bothers me about this place is the fact that there's a different person that approaches your table for every stage of your meal.

We waited 45 min before being seated.  We decided to put it behind us. We were very discouraged and almost left. THEN WE MET OUR WAITER!!!  Christoper S. Was our server. Let me say he not only turned it around for us but made our friend love the place. He knew we were frustrated. He listened, apologized, and said would promise best service. Wow did he keep his word. He was on top of everything. Polite fast in delivery of food and as a special treat he gave us a small desert on the house.  If that is how he serves everyone then this restaurant needs to recognize the GEM they have!! Chris was the face of this restaurant tonight for us.  He made sure the food was perfect and it was very very good. Our drinks were always full and we felt valued as customers.  He's not even a manager. Just someone who loves his job, cares about his company and obviously loves people.  CHRIS you made our night. Thank you. BJ's you better recognize what you have and use him as an example for the rest of your team. He is the only reason why I am putting 5 stars. It's all for Chris, and the chefs who made our food.  Thx again guys and your hostess needs to GO!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=280,3.4,3.14,2.716,2.9960000000000004,3.2440000000000007

With that said,  our server (yes I'll say his name) Anthony was all but great, I wondered thr entire time if I or one of my friends offended him at all before I arrived 10 minutes after they arrived. Of course they didnt. I'll keep this part short but basically we were ignored, we had to flag him down for everything, everytime something was delivered he preceded to run away from the table without asking the rest of us if we needed anything, I couldn't believe he did this more than once, the resturant was not at all busy. ANOTHNY never checked on us after we got our meal, never offered refills on drinks...my friends diet Pepsi was empty for almost 20 minutes before she had to flag down the server. I myself had a glass of wine which I also not offered another glass on this half off wine tuesday, in fact I still had food in front of myself when the server dropped of the check. How rude. YOU NEVER DROP THE CHECK WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE STILL EATING. HOW RUDE, I asked for cracked pepper on my salad which he completey ignored, I then pretended to add more table pepper to my salad to see if he remembered.  It doesn't take it to be another server to realize  how god awful and careless this dude was. Made me sad. But we still tipped him at least 10 percent even though he did not deserve a penny. Really hurt how someone could be so rude.

189,The Ç.,"Oakley, CA",0,14,,4.0,2016-04-10,"I've been here many times and I wish I could give this place that fifth star, but honestly I've had too many occasions where the service was bad. The food is excellent and they charge only half for virgin drinks, which is why my friends and I continue to go back there, but there have been some problems with the staff. First of all, the server was really inattentive. She didn't take our drink order for like, 20 minutes. I was about to call the manager when she finally showed up. After she finally brought the food out we never heard from her again. The other servers were at least polite and filled our drinks for us on request. One of my friends is a vegetarian and usually gets a soup and salad. This was the first time we brought her with us, and they served her before everybody else and she finished before we all got our food. That's backwards. Her meal only took a minute to prepare and should have been served at the same time as the rest of us. Now I have to explicitly ask them to prepare hers last. Last time I went, it was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I had dinner there. I ordered a personal pizza with pepperoni and artichoke. It was expensive for being mostly bread, but the kicker was that among the artichunks there was one, single, solitary pepperoni. The server rushed off before I could stop him. I must have stared at it for a good minute wondering why somebody would make a pizza that way and consider it acceptable to serve and why the server wouldn't take one look at it and ask what was up before carrying it to my table and skittering off. I had to flag down a different server to get it replaced, and when I got the second one it had tomato chunks all over it which I had requested to be left out. The manager himself gave it to me and at that point I was more amused than I was mad. I opted to pick off the tomatoes rather than have it remade a third time because I was starving, but they threw in a free dessert and gave me a coupon for a free dessert on a subsequent visit. If you can get past the occasional major inconvenience, this place has awesome food and drinks though. Their weekend brunch is actually delicious.

Third issue, they came out promptly when we called the curbside number to take our credit card payment and then took over 20 minutes to come back with the food( btw we phone ordered our meal over 60 minutes ago at this point) they apologized for the wait and said it was because they were so busy, isn't the reason for take out/curb side to get a meal faster than dining in the restaurant?!? And they don't even provide any utensils!! They should NOT offer take out/curb side service if it cannot meet the restaurant service level or any decent customer service level!  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because we have eaten inside and had decent service with good pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=260,3.16,3.21,2.78,2.6320000000000006,3.19

She has just the right amount of attentiveness and her demeanor is delightful! We very much appreciate that once we've been served our bill, or even paid our bill, she still fills our water glasses and continues to ensure our needs are met. One of the delights of eating out is to linger, to sip wine and enjoy the company of others. It's rare to get continued service once the meal is eaten, but Ashleigh gets it. I understand that economically, it's just good business to move us patrons along and seat new patrons--but we visit restaurants as much for the whole experience as we do the food, the prices, or the atmosphere. In addition, I must rave about BJ's ribs. It's the only place I order them. Forget Lucille's or Black Angus - there is no competition. I order my ribs at BJ's ""dry"" (without sauce) but they are anything but dry - they are moist inside and slightly crispy outside: perfection! The rub they use is all you need.

But for a BJ's it should really only be 2 stars.  The good: - Friendly and attentive service. Others here on Yelp seem to disagree, but ours was really good. - Clean and new looking premises, interior, bathrooms. The bad: - Caesar salad looked good, but in no way tasted like one. Just couldn't figure it out. Disappointing - Deep dish pizza (that's why I come here for) was bland and doughy. If we had had more time I would have sent it back to the kitchen. - Asian dinner salad looked like a mediocre mini salad from your favorite fast food place. In fact, it was just a bit bigger than the Caesar side salad. After expressing my deepest disappointment I got a new one. But even that looked skimpy. Weird.

117,Sara H.,"Oakland, CA",93,120,1.0,2.0,2016-06-15,"I, like many of the reviews here, am sorely disappointed in this BJ's location. I sincerely believe they are so corporate, that they just don't care about service. I am well-versed in this location as I have been here at least 5 times. I come back for the GF pizza and GF beer, but when I do, I expect nothing less than HORRIBLE service every single time.....at least I'm never disappointed! The first experience I had was with their takeout. They have a little door to the left of the main entrance to go through in order to get to the takeout/pickup area. I didn't see it and walked through the main entrance. I walked passed the two hostesses, they pointed out the pickup area and I walked over to an empty area....no one there to help me. I continued to stand there for what seemed like 5 minutes. I tried to stop two people who happened to be walking by and I know they heard me, but didn't even acknowledge me. My friend and her boyfriend came in after me wondering what was taking so long. They both tried to get someone to even look at us and nope. Finally someone walked out from the kitchen and assisted us in paying. My most recent experience was two weeks ago. I went there with a couple of friends who were in the area visiting. I prepared them by making sure they knew this was going to be a very long meal. It was 9pm when we arrived on a Sunday evening. There were no other customers in our seating area and the server confirmed we were her only table. We ordered alcohol and it was served 20 minutes later. One of my friends couldn't decide what she wanted so the server left and didn't come back until 20 more minutes later. By this time, we are ordering more alcohol, appetizers, and our meals. 25 minutes later, food finally comes out - but it's all the food; our appetizers and our meals at the same time. We ordered drinks one more time before the end of the meal. We have now been in the restaurant for about an hour and 20-25 minutes. No check brought to the table. I ended up getting up and walking all the way to the hostess stand in order to pay the bill. Needless to say, that bill was around $125. I tip nicely and would have easily given her at least $30, but I don't tip nicely with horrible service. The thing that worries me the most is that corporations come into small cities like Brentwood, don't do anything about their service, and when people no longer wish to settle for that service, instead of changing, they close the store and leave the city in financial peril.

The reason for the bad review is because the ranch that came with my man's buffalo wings had a piece of IDK what... I wish I took a picture of it but it was just nasty I pretty much lost my appetite. Our waiter said it looked like a piece of calamari (which we DID NOT order) but because my man found it because he chewed on it he said it had to be HELLA undercooked because whatever it was felt like a rubber band.

I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and my husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were very good, and our food came out fast, fresh & hot.  *Waiting time to be seated was about 10 minutes, which was good for me. - CONS: *I highly disliked our waitress. She BARELY came to check on our table, and we waited THIRTY MINUTES for her to come, because we had finished our dinner. I needed a box and we wanted to order dessert. I had to ask the hostess to track her down.  *The bathrooms are disgusting, there's only about 4/5 stalls and they. were. FILTHY! We came to dine here on a Sunday, around 8:00 pm. I usually don't ask to speak to the manager of restaurants, but I'm definitely complaining about our waitress' lack of customer service and hospitality. I understand if you have a lot of tables, but tonight was fairly calm & we should not have to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to check on us, sad to say we didn't order dessert. I spoke to the manager, a nice man - and he apologized and explained to us that it was a miscommunication due to our original waitress going on break. He offered to buy us a dessert to go, on the house but we declined. He also asked if there was anything he could do to make it better, but I said no. I simply just wanted to let him know that we were unhappy with the service. I did explain to him though, that everything else was fine as far as food went. Probably won't come here for a while again. Sucks because we're new parents and this was one rare occasion where we were able to leave our baby with family to enjoy some quality time out to dinner, without our little one.  I wrote this review while still sitting at our table, waiting to pay for our food. The manager took our cash to pay for the bill, and I asked him if I could get a little box to put my leftovers in. The waitress came with a receipt and our change, apologized but didn't bring a box.

We had one of the best servers I've ever experienced - wish I could remember his name so that he could get kudos. Hopefully this means their service is improving and not that it was a lucky night and we got the best waiters in the county.  The food is still so-so in my opinion, but adequate. We mainly go for the ice cream cookie desserts which the kids (big and small) love-love. THANKS FOR THE GREAT SERVICE. I've raised from a 3 star to a 4 star. ______________ Let me start by saying this is a complaint. With that said, BJ Restaurant in Brentwood has a great atmosphere and is in a very good location; their staff are friendly. It is a good place to have a drink or a couple beers (Brewhouse) if you are so inclined while waiting for your food. I think this is why they are still in business.  I've been there a number of times for special family occasions - typically a small group. The wait before and after seating is agonizing if you go with an appetite; this last time despite trying to be ahead of the curve and ordering in advance online, apparently their online system was not working properly at their end, the order was lost and there were all kinds of problems straightening it out - it took 45 minutes for the first sight of food, another 20 minutes to get the main course. Our salads were served without utensils - it took three requests to finally get a fork, the hostess at the front desk was not at all helpful, the server seemed overwhelmed and his backup person ditto. This was mid afternoon, intentionally planned to avoid dinner (or lunch) rush and there were many tables and booths vacant - maybe less than 50% capacity. Because of the apparent disorganization I think perhaps there is a management problem. The servers were trying hard to do their job... with a smile, however, the good service mark was seriously missed. This is a fun place to go but you decide if you can endure the wait and possible service problems before finally getting a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=180,2.6,3.05,2.908,2.192,2.8699999999999997

I've only been to this BJ's one time for dine-in, once for order out, and then I tried to do curbside this last time. No where did curbside tell me I had to call a number before I could pick it up, so we sat there looking like an idiot for a while waiting for a food. Meanwhile our food is getting cold and nobody even called to see if you were coming yet. So the pizza that we always order was less than appealing this time. There was almost no sauce, it was crispier than a cracker, and couldn't even to the edge pieces. I was really disappointed with the pizza and I spent almost $100 period I was too tired for my day at work to bother going in to make a complaint. And I also asked her Ranch, and they never gave it to me. That's actually the second time that's happened to me there. And then when I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, I told the waitress that it was for my kids and I wasn't sure about it cuz I never ordered it before. I asked about size, but I didn't realize there was red pepper flakes. I would have appreciated her to take notice when I said it was for my kids, and she could have told me that it is spicy.

The food was okay and it was served to us in an adequate amount of time. However,  the server was rude and demeaning. I came in with my younger sisters and as soon as we sat down I could sense that the server was not thrilled to be serving us. When I explained to her how we would like our checks split, she became very condescending and rolling her eyes at us. We were a large group and we all ordered different things so just to ensure it wasn't confusing I thought it would be easier if I explain to her. She basically blankly looked at us and interrupted me in between my sentence and said ""So we're just splitting the check! That's what we're doing!"". I said yes, and then proceeded to tell her in what way we would like it split. She interrupted me again and said ""You're confusing me!"". Once she walked away, we spoke about how rude she had been and it turns out she was behind us and mostly likely heard what we said. Later on, when she came back with the check she was definitely more polite than she had been earlier.

ATMOSPHERE: Very nice atmosphere.  It is trendy and loud.  I like restaurants that are loud because that way other people could not easily listen in on our conversation.     SERVICE: Finally came back here with my friend for lunch.  The server was attentive in the beginning and she even poured more iced tea for us without asking which was nice.  After my dessert came, our server brought over our bill and I asked her for water since I drank all of my iced tea.  She took our payment but never brought me water.  I was so thirsty after eating the pizookie that I needed some water.   FOOD:  - Lemon Thyme Chicken $11.25 - 3/5.  Served with brown rice, sautéed red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and roasted brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.  The sauce was a  little too soupy and tangy but good.    - Clam Chowder Soup - 4/5.  Good flavor.    - Roasted Salmon Peruvian Quinoa Bowl $15.95 - Sautéed red onions, quinoa, sliced mushrooms, sautéed spinach, seasoned tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.  There was quite a bit of spinach.  Salmon was cooked just right.  - Salted Carmel Pizookie - 3/5 (cookie baked in a pan topped with Vanilla ice cream) $7.50.  Too sweet and it's quite small.  It cooled too fast and the cookie got too crunchy.

No option for the donor to give all of their credit card information over the phone and Order directly with the restaurant. Most people prefer to pay with credit card.

3,Bill F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,20,7.0,1.0,2017-11-06,"We are longtime patrons of BJs, having lived in Baton Rouge and Albuquerque prior to Brentwood.   We had always enjoyed the extensive menu offerings and good drink selections.    We were happy to find your location after moving here in 2015. As you can see from our activity, we would typically dine in 2-4 times a month, whether appetizers and a drink, or more recently enjoying your Prime Rib offerings.      I am vegetarian, and have enjoyed the expansive list of items you offer.  We write at this time as we have seen a recent and notable decline in food quality and service.    Whereas a year ago we would tell friends and family ""BJ's is A+- great servers and awesome foods"", we find ourselves actually shying them away, having ourselves experienced more than a fair number of failures in service and food quality. Of note, the recent cited visit has made us to decide to make the drive over to the city for offerings or out to Tracy for the TX Roadhouse.     Service has slipped- booths are dirty, even at 4pm- sticky and wiped with towels that are stagnant.    We used baby wipes to wipe the smell from our own table.   I requested to know what the guest tap of Speakeasy Brewery was, as I saw it listed on the board.   Our server actually argued that I did not read it right, and repeated the BJ brews.   I asked her to read the board and find out what the varietal was.  She did, and 15 minutes later, we had the drinks on the table.     15 minutes.  We then ordered Root Beer ribs and Siracha Brussels sprouts.  We got cold ribs with almost no sauce on them, and straight mayonnaise on the Brussels sprouts.  Having ordered them often, we know how they are to be presented.   After arguing with our server that it was not ""siracha mayo"", she brought a bottle of siracha to the table- not a small cup, but a half bottle, grease covered, from the server station.          My wife ordered the Prime Rib dinner, medium rare.   Came out looking great in color, but was ice cold- potatoes, meat.    Asparagus was woody, cold and shriveled.   She sent it back.   Second round comes out 15 minutes later, same thing. Cold.     Server argues it came right out of the oven.  We asked her to touch it herself.  She did, and agreed it was cold.  My wife declined a third attempt, and asked for a French dip.   Guess what-  cold.   Au jus, cold and crusted with fat on the top edges.  Fries- recycled?   couldn't tell, skipped it.    Server ""comped"" the sandwich and said there would be no charge for the prime rib plates..... really? I ordered the lentil soup- it came warmer than usual, maybe 110f.    On my last three stops, the stop was always cold and sent back.   I requested they microwave it in an attempt to get them to understand the cauldron was cold.    I also ordered beet and arugula salad.   Came minus the roasted almonds.   We were too tired arguing with the server to point it out. Manager on the floor? No where to be seen.    Servers- standing at the server stations BSing.   Hostesses?  Looked like High School girls gossiping at the front.    We have seen this get more and more pronounced each visit, and now feel unwelcome and unsatisfied returning.  By the way, it was not busy when we were there, but it was a Friday and the World Series game was just starting.    Lot of missed opportunity to serve food and beverage----        We actually went to Mels and ordered dinner- my wife having been served nothing edible at BJS. Just thought you would like to hear from a long time, multi store, customer who probably wont come back.    *********update ********** Manager called Day after I wrote this (had emailed a copy to the two co owners) ""Sorry sorry sorry"".   Excuses and admitted problems.    That was it.   Pretty obvious the place has gone down in the past 6 months.     Excuses and requisite sorrys We take the drive to WC and hit Pizza My Heart.    Better Pizza, much cheaper, great staff and small but good beer selection.   Great rewards program.  Pizza by the slice or whole pie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=20,2.6,2.61,2.884,1.7320000000000002,2.606

We had the same issue with a few other condiments and sides we ordered, and we never got the plates we asked for when the appetizers came.  The worst part though was my food. I ordered a chicken sandwich that looked good on the menu. What came out actually looked like a chicken strip in the middle of a large bun. The cheese and dressing that were supposed to be on it were missing as well. I asked for the manager and she agreed that the sandwich looked ridiculous and she apologized and said she needed to have a talk with the chef. She asked if she could get me something else, and reluctantly I ordered another (different) sandwich. That sandwich finally came when we were leaving, which was about par for the rest of the visit.

24,Isaiah G.,"Pittsburg, CA",8,320,536.0,2.0,2018-01-08,This place is in a big outdoor shopping center. Parking is a little busy. This place is huge inside and they have a small waiting area. I had previously been here to the bar area. The bar area is ok and they have plenty of seating. There is a lot of tv's all around the place. We decided to come here for my sons birthday lunch. It was Thursday and was pretty busy. The appetizer was well sized portions but it tasted like frozen microwave food. The chicken sandwich I got was way too greasy. When we were done the waitress was talking to her friend and it took forever to leave. The bill was $60 for three people. I thought was a bit high for the type of food. This place is good to go to if you want to drink and are buzzed that food taste no longer matters. Sorry two stars for the portions of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood,2.04,2.6,2.836,,2.3760000000000003
