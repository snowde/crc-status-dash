Love their homemade root beer, it has accents of vanilla and licorice if you like root beer it's a must try. I also like that they have mini appetizers. Another reason to try BJ's is the Pzookie! Warm fresh out of the oven large cookie served with ice cream!! YUM YUM! They also serve their own beers if you enjoy beer drinking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480,3.2,3.3,3.3,2.768,3.2600000000000007
695,lindsey a.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,4.0,2.0,2012-02-16,"I LOVE the food here but this location is the WORST. It's close to my house, so it's convenient but I'd definitely rather go to the Glendale location, and here's why: -The first time I went here, we were seated and our sever never showed up to our table. When I say never, I mean never. We waited for 30 min since it was busy, and then called over a random server to see what was up. She said she'd find our server and send them over. Didn't happen. We called her over again and she ended up taking our order out of pity, even though she was slammed. Naturally, the service sucked since we weren't her table. We never met our real server. -One time, we were sitting in the back and a COCKROACH ran across the wall. I freaked out and got up. The manager came over and said he couldn't see it but asked us if we wanted to move (Um, no, I want to stay and dine with it...?). He placed us a few seats over which wasn't really far enough. I was sketched out the rest of the meal. We could see out of the window that the dumpster was close to the booth we were sitting in, so that's definitely where it came from. -Another time, when eating the spinach artichoke dip, I bit down on a huge chunk of GLASS! We could see that the dish the artichoke dip was in was cracked and missing a big piece,  about the size of a quarter . The piece was now in my mouth. The waiter didn't seem too worried. He kind of apologized and took it away. He didn't replace it, even though we were only half done. He ended up giving us the appetizer for free but that's all. Now, I'm not one to expect free stuff from places but I felt like this matter should have been handled a bit better. For all they knew, I could have cut myself or went home and filed a lawsuit. They treated it like I complained that the dish was cold or something.  Every other time I've been here the service has been super sketch.  So why do I keep going back??! Because I am obsessed with their BBQ Chicken Salad!! It's my favorite salad ever. Their food is always good. I've never had anything bad from BJ's (except service). Their beer is amazing too. **Oh and a little tip: When you pull up, there's a valet man who wants to take your car. Valet is  optional!!  Just tell him you want to self park and drive 3 feet forward into the lot. Most everyone thinks you have to valet so they pay money to have this man pull your car up a foot and park it. Unless you're the laziest person in the world, save your $3.50 and park it yourself.   After the glass incident, I switched to the Glendale location and haven't had any more problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=720,3.08,3.31,3.31,2.504,3.218

446,Candace L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2883,1503,3011.0,4.0,2012-03-04,"3.5 STARS BJ's is a great chain restaurant - pop in for a pizza (they now have whole wheat crust, which is wonderful) I love the deep dish with big chunks of tomatoes. Have a beer and order a pazookie and you are good to go! They have a HUGE menu! I'm sure other things taste fine but I go here and keep it simple. This is a very casual place to pop in for a quick bite to eat, good for families and kids. Recently discovered this is one place JBHS Show Choirs go to get their grub on after shows - way to support the local Burbank businesses. Part of me imagined the entire place breaking out in song and dance with all of them there but it's more like them just being teenagers. I like to take my son and his friends here before or after catching a movie at an AMC in Burbank. Parking is a little annoying - not sure what the deal is, sometimes its valet, sometimes its free valet or sometimes there is self parking up top in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480,3.08,3.34,3.34,2.6399999999999997,3.2360000000000007

My last visit may be my last. I understand that it was really busy, Friday night, etc. It took my waiter 25 minutes to make his presence at our table. The pictures on the menu of the food are very deceiving (my mozarella and tomato salad was half of what I thought it would be) and the portions are super small, yet the food is so expensive. What I did have here though, was very good.  We sat by the bar, which was a huge mistake. This place is where drunk men that are going through midlife crisis' go to to be loud and annoying. I almost put an axe to the chair he was sitting in so he could fall and hopefully hit his head. Not to mention, the stuff he was talking about LOUDLY was quite inappropriate. Had I had kids with me I would have taken it upon myself to tell him to shut the hell up or leave. I really do think that the staff at this place should have taken it upon themselves to ask him to shut up or to leave. None of them said a single word to him.

689,Angie C.,"Mountain View, CA",43,152,1.0,1.0,2012-03-06,"I went to another BJ's Brewhouse in northern California this weekend that made me recall the absolutely HORRIBLE service from the Burbank BJ's. When I relayed the story to my friend, she advised me to share it on Yelp as well. 1st horrible experience: I threw a surprise party for a friend. I made the arrangements with the general manager three weeks in advance, down to the last detail including that there would be multiple checks, the party guests would need to be seated immediately even if the entire party wasn't yet there (it was a surprise, after all), and that I'd be bringing a cake/candles for the birthday girl. The morning of (Saturday in September 2010), I brought in the cake and candles and confirmed all the details with the host staff and management. Everything went smoothly for about an hour, and then things fell apart. It took more than two hours to split the checks, even though I'd offered from the start to help the servers divide them up and keep them separate. During those two hours, NO ONE came to check on us. Plenty of people wanted dessert and alcoholic drinks, but we couldn't even get anyone to bring water. I asked the server THREE TIMES for the cake. When she finally brought it out, she plunked it down in front of me (still in the box with the candles in a bag on top) and walked away. The most frustrating part was talking to management as this was happening. I was mortified that my guests were unable to leave whenever they felt like it because they didn't want to stick me with their bills. We were all stuck there for several hours with no drinks, no snacks, and no birthday celebration despite it all having been arranged in advance. When I pointed this out to management, he repeatedly apologized. Nothing more. I finally had to ASK what steps were being taken to fix the problem, and what they planned on doing to compensate us for the ruined party. After about 4 hours in the restaurant, we finally had an acceptable solution and got to leave. I was satisfied with the resolution and even came back a couple times (with non-memorable experiences) until my next horrible experience. 2nd horrible experience: This time, it was MY birthday. I was stuck at work, but wanted a to-go lunch from BJ's. I called in the order and left to pick it up. The problem with this restaurant is really the parking layout and the valet service. When I pulled into the parking lot, the valets had parked cars in all the to-go spaces. The valets directed me to a non-existent spot at the back of the lot, and I had to circle the block and re-enter the lot. Then the valets directed me to a second non-existent space. I circled the block again. The third time, I was getting pretty pissed. The valets told me to park in the handicapped spot. I told them no. They told me it was the only way I'd be able to get in at the moment, and that they did it all the time with no problems. I told them they'd be responsible for paying for any parking tickets and parked, furious.  Sure enough, a driver who actually had handicapped placards stopped me and asked why I'd parked there. Frustrated, I explained to her that the valets had told me to do it, and all I wanted to do was get my damn lunch. Wouldn't you know it, that lady called the police on the valets? Apparently she was a regular at this BJ's and was tired of the valets taking up to-go spaces and then telling to-go orderers to park in the handicapped spots (how does this become standard operating procedure?!). The valet rushed in after me, grabbed my keys, and reparked my car before the police arrived. When I mentioned what just happened to management, and the fact that this was two horrible experience related to birthdays in just a few months, I got a very nonchalant apology. I had to chase corporate customer service for MONTHS to get a response. I wound up getting a gift card for the aggravation, which I promptly used at a DIFFERENT BJ's location. I will never be returning to this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=720,3.0,3.29,3.29,2.244,3.174

It's like the trading pit for commodities in Chicago. Why is it so bloody loud?  Also, ever notice and this is funny, they never, ever have the beer you want. Ever.

Pros: - The Food.  Other than the pizza, everything on the menu tastes SO GOOD.  The flatbread pizza is great, but the regular pizza is below average.  I recommend the Chicken Parmagian or their pastas.   - Outdoor seating on a sunny day during lunch. - Extremely low prices for lunch specials. - Their brewed beers deliver a strong buzz.  Porter is too strong, too dark though. Cons: - Valet parking during lunch, but it's totally free, and you can park a block away to the south on the street for free, fairly easily. - Pizza doesn't have enough sauce. - Some of the indoor wrap-around booths are uncomfortable to sit at.  Stick with the classic table and chairs, or sit outdoors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=620,3.04,3.3,3.3,2.512,3.1960000000000006

Although I didn't have any last night, the pizza is the only thing I'd recommend if visiting a BJ's. It's fairly decent but not traditional Chicago style pizza. The best comparison I can make is Pizza Hut's pan pizza (I figure nearly everyone has tried that at least once). Thicker but not as dense with a chunky marinara sauce and overall better ingredients. Whatever you do, DO NOT order that ""Greek"" pizza. One of the worst pizza's I've tried in my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that bitter mess. The Pizookie(?) is a solid dessert.   As a rule, most chains I review receive 3 stars as long as they're clean, consistent and efficient. A few years back we had our credit card information lifted and we have a strong suspicion it happened here. I can't prove it but I'm still knocking a star off because I have a feeling I'm right after retracing our steps. If I could, it would have received one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=560,2.68,3.16,3.16,2.408,2.9680000000000004

It was only 109 in Burbank today).  But that's fine.. the wind was slowly settling in.  I was told they had my table and were just cleaning it up and they'll be right with us.  Approx. 15 min. later, I jokingly went up to the same guy and asked, whatever happened to that table for Kim??  He gave that look of, ""Crap.. where did that go"". After a moment to regain his composure, he had us follow our waitress out to the back patio, So the work begins.  We all just sat down, no we don't know what we want for drinks (there's 5 pages of drinks) and no we aren't ready to order appetizers (again.. 4 pages min and we hadn't even opened the menu OR ordered our drinks!).  But thank you.  Little chit chatting  then spilt glass of water.  Oh the table is up in commotion.  LOL!  Waitress back.. so can I get you drinks.  Well, we just had an accident.  Um.. No not yet.  Thank you. Wait.. could we exchange this table for a stable table?  This one's wobbly.  Eyes roll, kids help.  New table in place.  Thumbs up! OK.. is everyone ready to order drinks?  Yes.  Start with the kids (the ones that look like line backers), work around.  Water with lemon.  Blonde Beer. Hefenweizen, couple pops.  Cool...  No appetizers?  No No thank you.  Oh wait, hello?  Um.   Whoo hoo..  Miss??  Waitress comes back, yes?  Do you sell potato skins?  Yes.  Well we would like an order.  Yes please. Thank you. So you ready to order dinner.  Yes.  Finally.  Please start with the kids (I think they've become full backs by now).  Couple root beer floats, fish & chips, pizzas, burgers, etc.'Great!  Um. could I get a refill of my lemonade.  uhh Sure. Food came.  Everything seemed to par.  Fish and chips were quite nice.  Not to oily.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the thin cut fries!  BONUS!!!  Root beer floats were awesome!  Pizza.. eeehh.  Nothing to write about here.  Overall food decent.   Can I get anything else?  Everyone no no no no... um, yes.  Um hello.  yooo hooo.  It's ok.  No, what is it you want?  WAITRESS!!!  Did you want a drink.  Yes... Just a beer with my pizza.  HELLO MISS... yes?  Yes.. she would like a beer with her pizza.  Ok.  Beer first.   Tick tock tick tock.  Ding.. there's the pizza.   Here's some extra root beer for your floats.  Cool, thanks.  :)) Holy crap!!!  No one told me don't mix the root beer float mix with the soda!!  Bwahahahaha!!  It was like a mentos and coke explosion!!!  Damn it.  LOL.  We need more napkins!!  Next.. is there anything else I could get you?  Um yea.. we had another accident.   We need more napkins.  Ok  20 napkins later.  We're good. Are you Gil? Yes.  Here. Sets down a mini pazookie with no candle.  Walks away.   Wow.. really??  We come here with 9 people to celebrate our friends birthday and our waitress apparently doesn't have time to sing or even smile!  Hell.. a candle would of been great!  We have been here multiple times before to celebrate birthdays and we've always been sung to.  Matter of fact the other group outside seemed to have had 2 birthdays sung to them.  What are we chop liver?? Fast forward to checks.  Mine has someone else's item.  Theirs is missing it.  Can you fix it?  Waitress (Rachel) states, can you just put the payment in so I can take them.  I have like 6 other tables inside.  WOW!!  So we just settled up with each other and when she came back she decided she would change the bills to the correct bills.  Ugh.. ok, no worries.  OH WAIT!!!  They added on 17% gratuity to the bill.  Now mind you, I don't mind gratuity being added to groups.  Especially when they've gone through the trouble of at least trying to keep our bills separate.  But what is really starting to bother me is waitstaff NOT STATING there has been a 17% gratuity added.  And then to top it off, they have an additional tip spot to tack on a higher tip if desired and total.   Thought about putting a number in there and subtracting it!  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!   Listen BJ's Management.... hire waitstaff that can handle groups or don't give them to the groups and then give them 6 other tables inside!  Apparently Rachel doesn't like that!  Also, its just sneaky.. make it policy that if you have added tip, make the server state the fact.  It makes for good practice and honesty.  Probably the deal breaker for us ever going back.   :( Thanks for letting me share.

But this Burbank location provided the worst experience that I've ever had in terms of quality of food - I would've gotten better food digging through a trash dumpster behind any of the other restaurants in Burbank. I visited this location a couple Saturday ago with my wife, and decided to order wings, pizza, and a pizookie. The wings were delicious as always, but that's where the fun stopped. The pizza was undercooked by a significant margin and all I could taste was dough. I asked for a replacement, and the replacement took over half an hour to get, which wasn't the worst of it. This time they overcooked the pizza and made it into a hard, crunchy cookie that I could have easily thrown through a brick wall. And just when I thought the meal couldn't get any worse, out came this undercooked pizookie that was nothing more than raw cookie dough covered with ice cream.  All in all, a pathetic effort by this Burbank location.

The last time I was there was maybe a week ago. We got a pitcher of the Nutty Brewnette (if you like New Castle), this is the one you should go for). I wanted some fries and some chicken fingers, which is only on the lunch menu. They were nice enough to accommodate it, but when this order came....it was like warm. Like it's been sitting on the counter. So I asked if I can have it fresh and the next order was hot on the ouside, but hard/warm in the inside (like it wasn't cooked through). I didn't want them to spit in my food so I just decided to shut up from this point on. We also ordered the blackened chicken cajun pasta. The garlic bread is not a bread. It's a huge crouton.  The visit before this was worse in the summer when we sat outside. The server completely forgot about us. We ordered Martini's, appetizers, and the main dish (it was jut two of us). The main dish came. I was in shock, because we didn't have our drinks or utensils....and then the appetizers arrived, and then our Martini's. During this time, I continued to ask for utensils until I stood up to go ask and pick it up myself. I never get upset or complain, but I had to say something. I said, I normally would like my Martini and appetizers first before my main dish. The server's excuse was that it wasn't his shift and he was forced to cover....I just kind of sat there listening to him complain thinking....so what does this have to do with me and how are you going to fix it? He didn't care and it really upset me so I had to tell the manager. The manager just said he'll give us one of the dishes on the house in the attitude like as if he's saying, ""are you happy now?""

As the manager is apologizing, our server came out with my (correct) burger.  however, now my steak fries had changed to the string fries.

Our meal started off with some of the Calamari and dipping sauce.  Then to our main dishes which where the Bacon Cheese burger for me, and a patty melt for her.  Both with the potato wedges and some dipping sauce.   To drink I had the Cream Soda which was really tasty, and my girlfriend had a few cocktails.   The food was good, the service was fast, and the Atmosphere was quiet considering there were a few groups of people inside throughout the restaurant.  Our waiter was pretty helpful and stopped by to check on us a few times, and offer some suggestions on appetizers, drinks, and desserts.

I have always sat at the actual bar or one of the surrounding high top tables. I don't really care about the whole service aspect of the dining room in corporations such as this one. They always seem to coddle you, filled with fake enthusiasm and try to push things on you that you have no desire for. The bar area is easy, laid back, chill. Plus during breaks in conversation, while say your friend went to the restroom, you can catch the scores to every game.      The happy hours are pretty decent here too, there are two of them. One during the traditional hours one would normally be use to seeing post work, as well as the reverse happy hour that starts at 9, i think, and goes til closing.      The food is decent, better than I anticipated actually. The beer is great, I really enjoy the red, and usually stick to this over the others. Although the last time I was there I noticed something new, guest taps!! And quite a lot to boot too. I was surprised as well as curious and made a mental note to look at the list next time.      The service has generally been great, smiling happy servers that seem genuine rather than acting as if they care.     Remember to stop for cash for the valet. The first time I came here I was driving my manual transmission Mustang and opted to park it myself in the structure. The ramp that leads up to the top floor is steep as hell!!

832,Rhonda C.,"Sylmar, CA",51,13,,2.0,2013-02-11,"I had eaten at BJ's once before - We were seated in an alcove at a large round table next to a door to the patio dining area.  It was cold out (it was April) and the constantly opening door made it cold inside.  It was not diners who were coming in and out, but employees - management could not be bothered to seat us elsewhere even though we asked.  There was also an unpleasant smell.  I ordered the Tuscany Pasta with grilled chicken that evening - what came was burnt chicken on a bed of pale angel hair pasta.  There were pale tomatoes, which tasted acidy.  To give credit, the waitress brought parma cheese, garlic salt, etc, immediately and exchanged the burnt chix for a fresh piece, so I figured it was a one time thing.   Last night we had a family dinner, and ended up at BJ's.  We ordered our drinks and an appetizer from one waitress who handed us off to another due to required breaks.  She seemed to have it together and was very attentive and nice - we did not see her for the rest of the evening - we were there for 2 1/2 more hours.  The second waitress seemed to be lack luster and apathetic - took our order and went along her way.  It took almost 45 min for a third server to bring our soups (4 ordered soup - 3 soups arrived).  He brusquely served us and when asked about the 4th soup, he said ""let me get your server"" and walked away. . .it was about 15 minutes before our server showed up and by that time the main course came out.  When I asked about my soup she stared blankly and asked what kind of soup was it. . .she was not one of the two waitress serving the entree's and was just standing there.  One of the other servers was bubbly and apologized and explained the kitchen ran out and was making more!!!  But by that time I didn't want it - why would I?  my main entree was there!!!  My entree was Tuscan angel haired pasta and remembering what happened the last time, I ordered it with grilled salmon.  It was burnt to a crisp!!!!  I immediately called it to the servers attention and she again stood there.  The thin blond bubbly one whisked it away immediately and said it would be fixed.  I was hungry and annoyed!!!  The manager came over and kept asking if I wanted the soup.  Of course not - I just want my food already!!!  but he insisted I wanted the soup, so I would have soup!!!  The main entree came back out within 5 min, salmon was perfect this time, but pasta was missing peppers and pine nuts. . .I decided enough was enough and asked Apathetic waitress for garlic - she left and came back to ask whether whole or powder. . .Bubbly girl came back and gave me both.  Manager came again to say he was sorry, and offered a couple of deserts for free.  Great - my choices were pizookies with ice cream and a berry crumble with ice cream.  Apathetic waitress came back to take our dessert order - my children asked her regarding anything sugar free for desserts - She said ""ice cream"".  When my kids said, no - she is diabetic, anything else - Apathetic girl turned and walked away.  Then turned around, said ""i'll ask the manager"" and walked away.  Bubbly blond girl served us the one dessert we did order.  We never saw the manager again and when I tried to get Apathetic servers attention, she was in the middle of a group of servers, wildly waving her hands, while the other servers ackwardly glanced in our direction.  Finally she brought the bill and never came back for it.   I don't think we will ever visit again. . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=840,2.48,2.84,2.84,2.6320000000000006,2.696

430,Rick S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",541,1619,11938.0,3.0,2013-06-10,"BJ's is a reliable chain, the pizza is okay, but the deep dish is not similar to the Chicago styled pizza I've seen replicated at Zachary's in the Bay Area, in that it's more like thick crust than a saucy pie, but if you like a greater ratio of dough/bread than the thinner crust, and like your pizza soft, then you may love the pizza  for those properties. I had the Jambalaya which is $15.95 and is a generous portion with sausage, chicken and shrimp and has mild spices, so not too hot (you can add your own hot sauce if you want to too) and is zesty enough to appreciate the flavors without the heat killing the dish, which is what I like. The french fries are thin ('tho they offer wedge versions too) and have the look and taste that makes me think they're fresh cut (as opposed to frozen), which is always nice. The hamburgers, I believe they cook to order, or at least ask you how you'd like it, which is always nice.  It's a decent size too (and comes with fries). The Poke (Ahi/Tuna) dish was good, and has a generous portion of fish with avocado on crisp crackers. The waiting system is buzzer/pager based and the wait isn't that bad when they're crowded.  The service is good, and the positions of the TV's are good, so you don't get a neck cramp trying to look at a TV screen, since there are pretty much TV's from every angle, which is nice. It's located in the more busy part of Burbank, near the Media Center area, and they do have a parking lot, either pay $3.50 for Valet, or there's free, but limited (however achievable with the right timing, patience and parking karma) FREE parking in the adjacent structure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=380,3.0,2.79,3.164,2.252,2.8740000000000006

A. Joke. It's not convenient. It's not fast. And it certainly doesn't make sense. So one evening, we decided to order take out for said pizza. We placed an order online and saw they had curbside pickup. Sure, why not. When our pizza was ready, we drove to the special parking spot in front of the restaurant and called the number on the sign. The guy who answered said, ""Let me guess, an order for Dave.""  Me: ""Um no, this isn't Dave."" How about less guessing and more getting the order right. So we told him our last name and he said they'd be right out. Now in this time, another customer had parked next to us, walked into the restaurant and returned 5 minutes later, food in hand. Ok, so we chose the wrong take out method. When a server finally came out with the food, I handed her my credit card. She had to walk back to the restaurant to ring me up, then back out to give me the receipt. What, no mobile credit card reader?   Sigh, I don't know what I was expecting but it sure wasn't that.

We got seated close to the bar which is fine because it was far from the kitchen. The sound level can be a little noisy but that is to be expected at a place such as this one. So really it was no biggie! Next here comes our waiter, he asks us if we would like to order some drinks to start. seeing as we don't drink we ordered a coke and a sprite with no ice, about 5 sec. Later here comes out waiter with the drinks. He then says he will give us some time to look over the menu. We were seated about 5-10 minutes before our waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order which we were. We ended up getting a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza and a side of chicken strips. Surprisingly the order arrived very quickly and was very hot. Also the food we got was just the right amount for us (2 people). So we began to chow down and our waiter comes over about 2 different times and asks how our food is. The food was really good. The pizza though is the topping on the cake, it is so delicious and piping hot I might add. So when we were finished it was almost like our waiter was watching us, because he came over and took our plates from us and offered dessert but we declined as we were going up the street to Yogurtland! Then before he got away we asked him if we could please have our check and he handed it to us. Our total was right around $27.00 which is not bad if you think about it.

457,Destiny C.,"Glendale, CA",60,253,51.0,3.0,2013-08-30,"I visited this location yesterday with my daughter and the bf. Three things stood out to us; the hostess, our server and our food.  Our visit started off and ended poorly with the hostess. She seemed distracted and made us feel unimportant... like, she had better things to do than greet us. There was no one else standing in the waiting area so I'm not sure what she could have possibly been distracted by. Then again, when we left the restaurant she didn't bother acknowledging our presence. She brushed past us... as if she still had something better to do. She wasn't with a guest either time that we encountered her so there really is no excuse for her rudeness and lack of... hosting. Someone yelled across the restaurant to thank us as we were leaving so we weren't the only ones who noticed her complete lack of friendliness.   Unfortunately, our pizza was pretty terrible. I am a big fan of BJs pizza and was very disappointed by what we were served. We ordered an appetizer platter, which was absolutely delicious. The pizza, however, did not live up to the same standard. My 2 year old daughter is a huge fan of pizza (as most toddlers are) and she didn't even eat it. The pizza was grossly lacking in sauce and cheese. It tasted as if we were just eating bread. I can get a large pizza for $5 at a pizza chain. When you walk away from a pizza restaurant having spent $50 on 1 pizza and an appetizer, you expect good pizza. I think this is the first time pizza leftovers have survived breakfast in my home.  The good news is that I was very impressed with our server. His name was David and he was possibly the best server I have ever encountered. I was a server for 7 years, it would be fair to say that I have high standards and David exceeded every one of my expectations. He was incredibly friendly and attentive from the moment he approached us. I cannot say enough about how impressed we were with the level of service he provided. You can thank him for 3 stars instead of 1 or 2!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480,2.44,2.69,3.056,2.8280000000000003,2.59

796,Brittany B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",191,1064,133.0,3.0,2013-09-08,"Really nice servers but a few quarks that make the experience more of a three. I love BJ's in general, as far as chains go. The in-house brews are a treat, and the non-alcoholic homemade drinks (like root beer, cream soda, and orange cream soda) are a nice plus if you are with a group that is not in for imbibing (as was the group I was with). But when we arrived with our party of five adults and two kids, they placed us in a booth that was really meant for 5 max. We had to ask them to move us, which they promptly did, to a table in the bar area. But, really, who puts 7 people in a booth that small, especially on a very hot day and when tables in the bar are plentiful? Service was great, orders taken fairly promptly, and refills kept a-comin'. There was a situation where two of the men in our group ordered bowls of clam chowder and got bread bowls instead, a minor mix-up. But towards the end of the meal our server went AWOL for awhile. This is less felt when you are with a big group and everyone is talking, but I noticed it. It was the very moment that my 6-year old wanted water to finish up his meal, and it took awhile from that point for our waiter to stop by so that we could ask for it. It was brought promptly from the point we could request it, and shortly after there was a shift change, so that could have been the reason. So even though the waiter was nice and helpful, just enough funky business to lose this place a ""4"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=780,2.44,2.67,3.064,2.7640000000000002,2.5780000000000003

First we ordered the Best beginnings appetizer combo, I tried everything but the avocado egg rolls. The Santa Fe Spring rolls were my favorite. The mozzarella sticks were skinnier than I am used to, coming from Wisconsin where we love our cheese. I was very impressed once I tried them though! We also got the chicken pot stickers, which would of been good if they hadn't sat under the heat lamp waiting for our other appetizer to arrive.  They were just a little crunchy on the outside.      Our waitress was really great at telling us what she recommended and was always on time with our soda refills, which is a must for us! We really hate to wait for refills :)     Next, I ordered the Blonde Fish and chips. Best fish I have had in awhile. Just squeezed a little lemon on them, and they were perfect! Even my husband, who is not a fan of fish, decided to try it, and fell in love! Said he may even order it next time!  All in all, very, very pleased with our visit.

329,Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3414.0,2.0,2013-10-13,"It's very rare that I give One-Star rating to a business, but when a very important person in my life wanted to enjoy dinner with her son and service is lacking, then the low rating is deserved. This is for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Burbank. Usually, once a week, I take my mother out to dinner to catch up. I had been frequenting the Burbank area more often and I had already gone Barney's Beanery. So, I wanted to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewery. Its located just a couple blocks south of Barney's, but right next door to Black Angus. You have two parking options: Valet or Self-Parking. It will be quite tight at the entrance and exit if you have a pickup truck. My mother and I had come in during a Thursday Night Football Game and ALDS Game. We were seated at third booth from the entrance just at the wall of the bar area. The lady who seated us told us that our server would be right with us. After five minutes, I was wondering where our waiter/waitress was. In about 10-15 minutes, three different parties were seated and their drinks ordered. I flagged down the next waitress that would walk down the aisle. I got a waitress and I told her that this was unacceptable for my mother and I to wait. She said that she didn't know where the waitress for the area was, but she was the only one serving the area. So, that did not make any sense. She had served three other tables, but neglected my table. I continued on to be a customer because my mother wanted to enjoy her meal with me. However, I was already upset by the fact that the other tables were served their drinks and food and it seemed like we just walked in right after. Normally, I would just walk out, but I wanted to see if there were any other pros that would make this up. There was just one. My mother just a lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a BJ's Irish Root Beer ($8.25). The reason why I ordered the BJ's Irish Root Beer was because, she saw a review next to the drink with the name: Ryan M. So I ordered because she spotted it out. Right after ordering our drinks, I told the waitress I am not waiting any more and order right now. I ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer ($16.95) and Crispy Thin Fries ($3.25).  I still was quite upset and to tell you the truth, the food didn't calm me down. Best Beginnings was very delicious. Best Beginnings had Spinach & Artichoke Dip with chips, Avocado Egg Rolls, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, and Mozzarella Sticks. Each had their own sauce which can compliment any food. Sometimes, I would dip the french fries in the sauce to mix it up. As I mentioned before, I was still upset and the food did not do the job. The waitress was who did take our orders was going on break. I did get her name, but her replacement, Lidia did better job in a few moments than the previous server. So, its not a one star review, but a two star, just for Lidia. I am not sure if she was aware of the situation before she took over. She complimented my watch and asked for my million dollar autograph when I forgot to sign the check. She deserved the tip because she did her job very well. The incident happened a few days ago and I emailed BJ's Corporate Office for a response. Let's see what happens. I was not particularly fond of what happened, but I couldn't show it to my mother. I know it was a memorable moment for my mom, but for me it was a service nightmare. So, I won't be coming back here until I get a response from BJ's Corporate Office and see how they can correct this service flaw. Yelp!

I'm allergic to pork so good thing I know the difference in how they look before I take a bite.  That dish also comes with wedge cut fries, which some days you'll get about 8 fries total. It's really pathetic looking even on the small dish it comes along with the sandwich on.

After 20 minutes and the whole table was feeling bad about eating in front of him without his food, we still were basically finished with all our meals when they brought out his burger and fries out.  He took one bite of the wedge cut fry and spit it out like something was wrong. He said something wasn't right and we all smelled them and compared them to someone else's and they smelled like burnt hair or burnt plastic. We actually took 2 home in a ziplock bag  like CSI in case he got sick. The next morning they smelled fine. Overall this place gets tons of business and is always crowded for big events and yada yada, but their food is awful, and their service is non-existent just like the marinara sauce they were suppose to put on top of my brother's spaghetti.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480,2.88,2.75,2.972,2.02,2.8019999999999996

469,Jay D.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,2,,1.0,2014-02-09,"From start to finish my experience at this BJs was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.    As I walked in to the restaurant with my family I knew I should have walked out, but I figured I'd give it a chance.  Starting with the hostess, no smile, no welcome was offered, we weren't even asked how many in our party.  The hostess had the ""I don't want to be here"" look.  Two other hostesses, one may have been the manager, standing there gossiping with her employees.  We were sat down right away which was a plus; however, we had to wait about ten minutes before our waiter took our drink order, by that time we were ready to order our food.  If they are going to make you wait that long at least offer a snack.   So we placed our orders and as I expected the food took some time to arrive.  If you've been to this place you know it's a good size restaurant. The main bar was some what busy, the party room/bar was empty, the dining room we sat in did not look completely full so I'm not sure what could explain the slow and poor service.  Our food wait time was about thirty to forty minutes.  Our waiter came by once to tell us or food was on the window and they were waiting for runners... Really, WTF, you tell me the waiter can't bring us our food.  To top it off, the runner tried to deliver our food to the wrong table, we tried to tell him it was ours but he had to go back and check.   Let's talk about the food, maybe it was the long wait that left a bad taste in my mouth but the food wasn't worth the price.  I ordered a Deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was good but the pizza looked like it went through spin cycle. Limited toppings, dried up sauce, cold from sitting on the window probably fifteen minutes.  The wife ordered a salmon dish. Of course it was cold and the flavor bland... You could smell the curry but couldn't taste it.  My son had the chicken scampe.  This one was OK taste wise a bit cold.  Service throughout was nonexistent. Asked waiter for Tabasco and a refill... Took a good seven minutes to get the refill and I never got the sauce. Not sure about this place maybe they had an off day but I doubt it.  You can't hide poor service.  Probably why half the place was empty during lunch hours.   If you decide to visit this establishment I hope your experience is much better than mine...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=420,2.6,2.74,2.964,2.084,2.684
712,Gil G.,"Burbank, CA",0,57,,1.0,2014-02-14,"Never again. I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup. I kept finding chunks of inedible... stuff in there. I tried to eat around it (because I was hungry). Finally, there was a big enough piece so that I could examine it. It looked to be wood. I found several other chunks in there as well. Waited FOREVER for the waitress to come by so I could say something. Someone else brought my entree (and, at that point, I didn't really feel comfortable eating it), so it wasn't until the end of the (uneaten) meal when she came by. I told her about the wood in my soup. She PICKED UP THE WOOD with her bare fingers and closely examined it. Pulled it apart to look at the fibers, ran her fingers over it, etc... Again, it had been in my mouth. Then she declared it wasn't wood and that it was probably part of an artichoke that had fallen in the soup. I eat artichokes all the time, and it wasn't that (and it was all throughout the soup), but whatever. I waited her for her apologize and offer $$ off the bill or something. Nope. No apology. She didn't even take the price of the soup off. I was furious but didn't want to ruin my date by bitching about it, so we just paid & left. Never ever again. The next week, I went to a similar, but different restaurant in Burbank. My husband's spoon had a weird sharp ridge on it, so he mentioned it to the waiter (I know it sounds like we go to restaurants and bitch a lot... but we really don't!). The waiter brought him another spoon. Later, the manager came over and was SUPER nice! Very apologetic (even though we assured him it wasn't a huge deal), brought us free dessert, and then took 50% off our check! All without us asking!

First off, forced valet.  Grr.  I hate that. I know it's necessary at times but it's a layer of annoyance that will deter me from coming here.   Secondly, food was just ok.  I had the Cobb salad (ok, but missing key elements of a Cobb salad, it was more of a hybrid salad) and clam chowder.  I took a spoonful of chowder and looked at my spoon- chocolate was embedded on the soup spoon.  Gross.  Those pizookies are pretty popular I take it, but not mixed in with clam chowder.  Took awhile to flag someone down to replace it.  My coworkers food all looked fairly ok though.  Burger, BBQ platter, chicken pasta dish.  Maybe I should have gotten one of those dishes.  One of my coworkers is all about their beer, and at the end of our meal found out he could buy a bottle.  Our server charged him separately, no problem. However the server then disappeared for about 25 min while we all wondered if he would come back with this bottle of beer.  He finally appeared with the bottle of beer, so we could finally leave, with little explanation of why it took so long.   There's so many options in downtown Burbank for this kind of food, so I'm bummed that this place couldn't wow me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480,2.48,2.74,2.94,2.408,2.636

The hostesses were great.  Friendly and helpful in picking a table with easy access for one person in our party who has some difficulty getting around.   Waiter came to our table immediately, and although he talked a mile a minute and mumbled which made him hard to understand, he was very friendly.  Drinks were fine.  Appetizer (Chicken Lettuce Wraps) was just okay. Waiter changed as our original waiter went home...but the new waiter was very nice and very personable.  He answered tons of questions. We ordered our food for the five of us.....and then we waited....and waited....and waited. We finally asked about our soup and salads that came with our order after about 25 minutes.  The waiter made an excuse about waiting for the soup, and then showed up about 5 minutes later with our soup/salad.  Cesar salad was blah.  Not much flavor in the dressing.   Our food came about 20 minutes after that.  Yes, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Buffalo burger was cold.  Moroccan Salmon was cold.  Santa Fe Rolls were cold.  Pizza was cold.  Quesadilla was cold.  The only thing served to us that was hot were the beans that came with the quesadilla! One item was ordered with no avocado, but came with avocado.  The pizza which was supposed to have mushrooms, didn't even have the mushrooms.   Our meal was pathetic.  We started to send the food back, but the waiter didn't seem confident that we would get it back any time soon.  So, most of us ate the cold food.   Except for the one in our group who hadn't wanted to go there at all....he just sat and shook his head saying ""Told you so!"" and wouldn't even touch his pizza.    He couldn't get out of that place fast enough.  Skip the pazookie!  Not worth it! The waiter did send the manager to our table and after expressing our disappointment, she did comp the entire meal.  The ENTIRE meal.  We certainly didn't expect that!

413,Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6.0,2.0,2014-02-17,"Used to come here a lot for the food back in high school and everything was great, would have gave them 4 stars back then. Went back recently for lunch and sever dinners, all pretty lackluster experinces.  Food: Same as with any other BJs really. Usually go with a burger or the pulled pork sandwich, if it's a large party we usually grab a couple pizzas and share. Burgers are juicy and delicious, the sandwich is also great, might be my favorite thing there. Pizzas to be honest isn't that good, crust is a little thick and there is very little topping. Toppings arent spread out evenly so someone can have like no crust and lots of topping when someone else ends up with all crust. The beers are tasting, big fan of the Piranha Red. And of course the pizookie, thing is delicious. Keep in mind the party platter is tempting to get but it is rather huge, takes about a good 6-8 people to finish.  Service: Here's where the downfall of this particular BJs. Service used to be good and consistent no matter the time or rush. Now the service is poor even when its not crowded. Food takes a while to come out and not everything is brought out at once, some orders are messed up and drinks take awhile to be refilled. And before all that the seating process is a little unorganized. They tell us 15 mins but then after those 15 mins they tell us another 10 and it continues for a few more times.  Location: Pretty good location right off the 5 freeway. Also kind of away from the more congested area of Burbank. Once you enter you are met by the valet drivers, you can leave your car to them for a couple bucks or you can drive pass them and find self parking on the second floor of the structure. Be careful of the ramp leading up to the second floor, its a little tight and steep.

Then everything went downhill.  We don't see our waitress for 30 minutes. The salad my husband ordered finally appears at 3:35, brought out by someone other than our waitress.  Baby is starting to get fussy now and a quick afternoon bite is turning ugly fast.  We get water and soda refills at 3:45. Realizing this just isn't going to work, 50 minutes after arriving, we ask to have our order to go.  An hour after sitting down, we now have our food.  Sure, the service was slow, but at least we have our food.  We get home, get the baby settled down for a nap, and go to finally eat. *sigh* the disappointment continues.

552,Logan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,3.0,1.0,2014-09-04,I tried to come to this location this afternoon. The parking valet blocks off 80% of the parking spaces available there for paying valet customers. They told me I couldn't park on the ground level and had to park upstairs in their garage structure. Their second level parking had half of the parking blocked off as well. There were no spaces available and when trying to go back to ground level I had no choice but to exit the same way I took going up. There was no separate lane from ongoing and in going traffic. It's a really dangerous move to try and cause accidents. Shame on you for hogging all the parking. I will never go here due to crappy unacceptable parking ethics by your valet people.You will lose customers daily to Black Angus right next door.

Seemed like a smaller location but they still had a good amount of seating. There are a lot of walls/columns so it feels really sectioned off and the layout isn't super open.  Thankfully I have never had to wait super long for a table. Service has been pretty good and the food was consistent with other locations. Highly recommend their deep dish pizzas (Great White is my fave!) and their pizookies (large baked cookies with ice cream on top) are a must! I love their Oreo one :) The only reason I was really turned off from this BJs was the valet-only parking. $3.50 to have a guy drive my car into a spot that was literally right in front of the restaurant. I could have done that myself and saved the $$.

337,James H. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,149,33.0,3.0,2014-11-12,"With Elephant Bar closed, BJ's is our local go-to for lunchtime catering when we burn out from burgers and need a wide variety menu. Service has always been excellent wherever seated (and the place is quite big for huge parties, if needed.) Bar area has lots of TV's for sports, if that's your need of the moment.  The food is pretty much middle-middle. Nothing really bad, nothing constantly craveable. I seem to like the entree salads the best of the mix, especially their version of the crispy chicken style. Standard pizookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter, caramel) seem best. Their seasonal ones are kind of hit and miss. The Chicago-style pizza never quite has been close, but it's a puffy crust semi-deep dish style that's edibly filling, as long as you're not expecting Giordano's. Fries come both julienne thin and wedge cuts, and are pretty good when topped with the works (chili, cheese, bacon, etc.) or the new Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde version. Have had fun with a Double Deluxe burger - which is best split into 2 open-faced versions since thats about 2/3 of a pound of meat. Not really a date night kind of place, but more like I want more like a Marie Callendar's without pie. Not Claim Jumper or Cheesecake Factory portions, but bigger than average. Vegetarians/Vegans might find it tough here - stuck with salads holding the cheese and bacon bits, or the some of their soups.  Beers are plentiful and include the microbrews and a fun sampler flight. Full bar, otherwise. Of course, Biersch, BBG, Black Angus, Barney's, Granville,   are up the street, so you could go nuts at happy hours bouncing from bar to bar to bar to bar to bar in downtown Burbank.  But for a sit-down-watch-the-game over huge nachos, or bring the whole family for a one-size-fits-all menu - no problem here. The valet parking has to do with the proximity to the big office buildings next door tending to take extra spaces whenever they can get them (none of the 1st street business buildings seem to actually have enough parking for ALL of their tenants). For evenings, you could always walk from across the street from the BofA parking, or any of the multitude of free parking multi-story lots if you're doing a night on the town in Burbank. Lunch hours, I'd stick to the streets along Angeleno, or the lots.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=360,3.28,2.82,2.78,2.636,3.004

It was obvious they had not even been greeted yet. In the 5 minutes it tool for someone to finally acknowledge either of our existences, two employees stood at the take-out desk and did not say a word or look for anyone to help the people standing there for so long. Several other employee's walked by at that time without even a hello. The hostess finally showed up and could barely finish a sentence, it was bad. So we get our seats, have our server take our drink order (we had ordered the food in the app already). He bring our fries and leave, we had also ordered chili. About 5 minutes later he comes back and asks us if we also ordered soup. We confirmed and 5 minutes later finally got that as well. Did not see him again until we were ready to go. Further, he too seemed to be unable to talk very coherently. My guest and I were quite  sure most of the staff had been partaking in some booze on a slow night.

471,Greg O.,"Mountain View, CA",0,6,,4.0,2014-12-02,"I get that this is a chain restaurant and there is nothing super individual about it, but when you are looking for a known quantity there is something to be said for a straight forward place where the food is the same no matter which one you go to.  That was my experience here and it was a good one.  I sat at the bar to watch MNF and was very happy with the bartenders.  Nika poured a great drink and gave me some good recommendations on the happy hour menu.  I had wings, a flatbread, and sliders (all small portions on the happy hour menu) and it was just the right amount for the duration of the game (I spaced them out).  The flatbread and sliders were what I expected and were good, but the wings were perfect.  For the true buffalo wing aficionado, they had just the right amount of sauce and were still crispy.

Entrees: You really can't go wrong with the food. Pastas, Seafood, Burgers, Salads, etc. You're almost sure to find something you like. My friend and I both got burgers and sandwiches, and they came out really good. I was offered the option of thin-cut or wedge fries, I chose thin cut, but they came out with wedges instead. They messed up there, but it was not a big deal cuz I'm not too picky about my food (unless I really don't feel it that day or hate it) Parking: This BJs is ridiculously busy, and the parking can suck. There's a small 2 story lot next to restaurant where you can park for free (if you can find a spot!), or you can pay valet ($3.50?) to park for you in certain designated spots.

Upon arriving, it was obvious the place was super duper packed seeing people stand around in the lobby area. We get it hence it was a Saturday night. When thy bf and I walked to the counter to check in, the lady w/ the curly hair didn't even look up but instead said, ""I'll be right w/ you"" typing away at her computer.

We ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was on point, but the cajun pasta hardly tasted cajun-y and just tasted like a tomato pasta. When we informed our server about this, she brought us dried red pepper flakes (the thing you put on your pizza) after 10 minutes. That didn't help. So we asked for hot sauce (another 5 mins) and barely finished half of the plate.

352,Brandon G.,"Burbank, CA",59,2,,2.0,2015-01-14,"If I had to summarize my entire experience, it would be blah. I saw on   that BJ's was running a promotion for buy one entree get one free. I saw the yelp reviews were pretty low, so I went in with VERY LOW expectations. I figured I would just have a nice Tuesday night dinner, and it'll be pretty middle of the road, but overall decent experience. I walked and get seated. The bar looked great, the actual interior of the restaurant is very nice and fun, lots of tvs, nice art/wall features etc. We're seated, my waiter was very nice dude, but when I asked what he recommended, he didn't really seem like an expert on the menu. I asked what he liked, he just told me what he saw go out of the kitchen a lot, and he basically just read off the menu the descriptions of dishes etc. So that wasn't that reassuring. I ordered one of their pizzas, half BJ's special or whatever they call it (it's their ""famous"" combination) and half chicken bacon ranch as just something ""out of the box."" My girlfriend ordered seared scallops, so I figured it would be a pretty easy 2 dishes to knock out. I ordered a beer, and it took 10 minutes for it to show up, and it was served in the cold glass, but  the beer wasn't TOO cold. I've never waited that long for a beer to be poured into a glass, and then it's not at a proper temperature? I can deal with the wait if they were slammed, but this is a Tuesday night. There was a decent amount of people in the bar area, but the rest of the restaurant was empty. Also the temperature of the beer is not the servers fault, but more of the brewmaster, bartender, or whoever was in charge of the kegs. Besides the wait and the temperature, the beer was OK, nothing great, but if it was at a colder temperature, it would be much more enjoyable.  When we got the food (which came in a reasonable amount of time compared to the beer), I was immediately disappointed with the quality. My pizza, although advertised as deep dish pizza, was really a pan pizza (with actually pretty thin-for-pan pizza size) absolutely covered in toppings. Every square inch had some sort of pepper, pepperoni, sausage etc. And the toppings were very meh in general, nothing really too fresh, the chunks of tomato's on the Bj's signature side tasted like they were canned or preserved or something, it just didn't taste fresh. The dough was also very doughy (not too crisp) and flavorless. I mean, the pizza wasn't terrible to eat or anything, but for $20 price tag its insanely overpriced. It really really reminded me of Pizza Hut quality, except sloppily put together. That's right, a phoned in Pizza Hut pizza with a $20 price tag. Yuck. My girlfriends scallops were an absolute joke in terms of size. They were pretty rubbery consistency, and were VERY small and thing, as if they sliced them in half to yield more on the plate. Again, the taste of the scallops weren't BAD, but the ingredients and the amount of food were less than average, mediocre at best. Overall, even with the promotion, I would have rather gone somewhere else for dinner that night. I think it's complete garbage that those entrees were $20 (for the pizza) and $15 (for the scallops) when you use terrible ingredients, sloppy presentation, which screams to me overall cheap business practices. My service was decent, the waiter was nice and friendly, but he wasn't that knowledgeable about the menu, and the beer was very average for a place that supposedly has signature beers. Personally, it offends me for a restaurant to fool people that it's more high end eating and cheap out on the execution. I can go down the street and pay half the price and go to places with nice food.  There are much better options in downtown Burbank to eat... go to any of those other places. ANY OF THEM. If you want to go to a place similar to BJ's but uses good ingredients, go to Gordon Biersch on San Fernando, which has similar prices but MUCH better selection and ingredients (like night and day difference.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=320,2.88,2.92,2.776,2.504,2.904

The PLACE: The restaurant has a great layout.  It's perfect for dates, big groups and game nights. The FOOD:  I have ordered so many items from the menu but I'll mention a few that I love and a couple that are...meh. Appetizers - My favorite appetizer is the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.  They're mouth watering good.  The mushrooms are juicy and the spinach filling is full of savory cheesy goodness.  The lemon pesto sauce is a beautiful compliment to the mushrooms.  I have to plead with myself not to lick the plate clean, lest I lose my date's interest. lol...  My second favorite is the Ahi Poke.  The tuna is fresh and the poke sauce is to die for!  Lastly, the hot wings.  The hot wings are great.  They are crispy with a nice light salty batter with sauce on the side.  The celery is fresh and the ranch is a good quality.  The wings are great to share and pair well with pretty much all of their beer choices. Entrees - My favorite entree has to be the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  The glazed mahi mahi is oven roasted and served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice mixed with a spicy soy ginger sauce then topped with slivered snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds.  The fish is always cooked perfectly.  The rice mixture is sweet and savory and light.  During my last visit I decided to try the Prime Rib (Just under $20).  I asked for it to be served medium rare.  I ordered it with seasonal veggies and cheese mashed potatoes.  When it came out, it was well done, the potatoes were fine but the veggies were under cooked and were 90% sliced carrots, green beans and Asian peas.  Normally, I don't care and I will eat whatever they give me.  But at $20, I really wanted something I would enjoy so after showing the waitress the steak (she saw the issue right away and offered to get it fixed) I asked her if they could give me rice pilaf instead of the veggies.  They were so kind and apologetic about it.  After the waitress left with my plate, the manager stopped by and apologized as well.  He was really awesome.  When it came out, the waitress asked me to check it while she was there, so I cut into it and it was PERFECT.  I mean, the steak could be in an educational book to show exactly what medium rare should look like.  It tasted, awesome!  The taste was something that merits being a $40 steak.  It had really good seasoning and was so juicy.  The rice pilaf was scrumptious as well.  It was cooked perfectly and had a really yummy chicken broth taste.  The potatoes (while a bit pasty for my liking) were very tasty as well.   Dessert - The Pazookies are a must when you come to BJ's. The cookie is fresh out of the oven and the ice cream is so creamy!  I am always too full to get one after a meal, so I will go JUST FOR ONE .  If you haven't tried it, you must!

I personally love this specific BJ's because it's so huge. You never have to wait for a table. I'm also a fan of the layout. There are a few different rooms so it doesn't feel like you are surrounded by people.  I've gotten so many things here, but I would say the ""Great White"" pizza is my absolute favorite. The personal size is perfect. I don't even like deep dish pizza but I just love it.  ALL of the appetizers are phenomenal. You really can't go wrong. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza dip though. I've made pizza dip before with basically the same ingredients and it's no where near as good as theirs.  This really goes without saying, but the pizookies are life changing.  I went this morning and was happy to find out they have a weekend brunch menu. I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza and it was really good!

Wanting a little sun, we opted to sit on the patio rather than the dimly lit restaurant so the seating was quick. We ordered a couple of lunch specials and drinks. The food (personal pizza, salad, sandwich) was your standard BJ's quality food. Wedge salad, potato wedges, chicken tenders, and of course the small pizookie were good, but the pulled pork sandwich didn't have enough sauce on it. From this visit I've now noted that they've gotten on board with smaller drink portions, so I got a half pint of their Berry Burst Cider since it was still midday.  The service was fine albeit laggy, but put me on the list of others who have issues with their valet parking. Being first time visitors, we pulled into the lot thinking the only option was valet because of their sign. If we knew self parking was also an option we would have tried that first, or at least nearby parking.

135,Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,948,1538.0,3.0,2015-02-25,"This review is for BJ's beer dinner event. Several times per year, BJ's holds beer dinners, highlighting a special brewery. This time it was Rogue Brewery from Oregon. The dinner is 4 courses with 8 different beers to try - 6 from Rogue and 2 beers that they brew themselves. The cost is $30 advanced purchase, $35 on the day of the event. They started with the lightest brew (good chit pilsner - yes, that's the name!) and progressed to the richest one (double chocolate stout). They served a variety of ales in between. Each beer pour was about 6 oz, so drinking a full 8 of them would have been way too much. They were very generous with their pours (sometimes offering seconds), and it was nice to be able to taste so many different beers. Unfortunately, the food was lackluster and boring. They started with 2 appetizers - crispy, fried artichokes and chicken tavern-cut (thin crust) pizza. The entree was cajun pasta. The apps were tasty enough but nothing special. The entree was horribly bland with a minimal amount of chicken and overcooked pasta. Dessert was an individual sized peanut butter pizookie (basically a big chewy cookie) topped with vanilla ice cream. If you like their pizookie, this is right up your alley.  The amount of beers to try was impressive, but the food left a lot to be desired. I'm glad I tried it, but unless they elevate the food, it will be my last beer dinner here. parking -limited free self parking or valet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120,2.92,2.89,2.792,2.604,2.902

We did a reservation for 18 people and did call two days ahead of time. You would think the management would be decent enough on holding a table for 18 at 6PM. I understand that most chains/restaurants are busy, but what's the point of reserving if we're going to end up waiting the exact same time as people who just come in?  Anyways, our reservation was at 6, but they decided to sit people in that area and they obviously can't kick people out of the restaurant (which is understandable), but when you have a reservation and we warned them we got 18 people. I think those tables should of been saved at least by 5PM.  So we pretty much waited for our table for about an hour and a half Yes, an hour and a half to get seated. Let me just name the issues we had at this place in numerical order. 1) We got to our table around 7:30. Thank you for the ""complimentary appetizers"", but this doesn't sum up to your customer service. 2)It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks. 3)We sat at our table staring at each other because we couldn't find our waiter and didn't take our orders about 30 minutes later. 4) Food took about 45 minutes - 1 hour to get to us. The 1 hour entree was done, but given to a different table....and when the entree came, it was made incorrectly.  We spoke to a guy in a plaid shirt and all he said was ""okay.""

First, they only have valet parking, but I thought to myself it was sort of nice for a day of celebration.  We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice and took our order promptly.

OK I'm a little confused but I understand these things happen so I just alerted the waiters and asked for a new salad.

We were seated right away and our server took our drink orders. Half an hour passed and they barely took our order for appetizers. For that length of time we had already decided what were gonna have as our main course. 2 parties came after us and they have already been served their appetizers while we were still waiting for ours. I called our waiter's attention to ask what was going on. He said its because we ordered steaks and those take a little bit of time. I said, ok thats understandable, but the appetizers shouldnt take that long. Then he said he was gonna check. Couple mins later the Manager (Im assuming she was the Manager) approached us and she was very nice and she apologized and that she saw the time of our order and she didnt know what happened either as to why it took so long, according to her, the appetizers that we ordered shouldnt have taken that long. She was very polite the whole time and I respect that. All in all, we probabaly waited about an hour and 10mins just to be served appetizers.  Now the food.  The quality of the Calamari rings was wack! It tasted different, it used to be light and crunchy, now its all greasy and chewy and it was a little bland. We had the Gourmet Mac n Cheese and that was good, also the fried artichokes, I didnt like those very much. I ordered the Ribeye steak medium well with the side of filaf rice and chicken tortilla soup. The chicken tortilla soup was a bit salty. My cousin who came later ordered spinach dip and chips. Refer to the picture i posted of the tortilla chips of how greasy they served it to us. Dont they let it sit on a napkin or at least shake of the residual oil? Idk if the regular main cook was off that day or whats going on?  By the end of dinner, I got the bill and they waived all our appetizers. They only charged us for the main course and the drinks, which I appreciate, thank you BJ's, but I didnt come to get free food. I am more than willing to pay, obviously, but service sucks.

Picks up the pizza, comes home, and on our Sweet Pig, there was very few 'sweets' or 'pigs' meaning very little pineapple or ham.  There was also hardly any sauce on the pizza so it was super dry and a thin layer of cheese.  Again, I worked at BJ's and never saw a pizza look like this.  Then, our chocolate cookie for the pizzookie was burnt to a crisp on the outside, and raw on the inside.  What the heck?!   This is not cool ever, but for someone's birthday meal?  I call BJ's and ask to speak to the manager.  I really want to remember his name correctly, I believe it was Mark (he was fairly new and had only worked at BJ's for a few months.)  Mark turned the whole situation around.  He was extremely apologetic and asked us to come into the restaurant as his treat to compensate for this nightmare of an experience.  We worked out the day and time. Came in and was seated.  Our server was very friendly, but pretty slow and forgot several requests (lemons for our ice water, to go boxes etc.)  We touch base with Mark and he did a great job dealing with us.  Meal was on the house and a bit of faith was restored in the Burbank BJ's location.  Good to see it's not going down the tubes 15 years later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=200,2.56,2.9,2.804,2.316,2.7640000000000002

And 5 minutes later someone else brings a full rack and said here is your full rack. No idea what happen there. However that half rack they brought out 25 minutes later we didn't touch because we were ready to leave!  Second time:  Waited 5 minutes for a someone to approach us for menus. We order drinks and appetizer as soon as she came. Following another 5 minutes we ordered wings it took 40 minutes!!!!! We asked for the check the same time the wings came.

Can't go wrong with their oreo poozokie and their deep dish pizza's! My family was in town and staying at the Marriott in Burbank, walking distance to this location. We figured why not grab some dinner there. We all love this place, so it was perfect. I called ahead to make sure we didn't have to wait too long, since it was a Friday evening. We got there, put our name in and only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated in a big booth. Perfect! Our waiter was great. He was super attentive and I could tell running around to make sure everyone was pleased, but apparently there were some kitchen issues. I'm glad we opted away from ordering a deep dish pizza (got the flat bread to start, which was good), because the large table next to us had ordered 2 large deep dish pizzas and apparently had been there for almost 2 hours waiting. They were accommodating, giving them free salads and making sure they were happy, but still!  My dad got the fish and chips, and my mom and I decided to split the avocado egg rolls and the shrimp scampi. She had ordered it before and enjoyed it, and I had been wanting to try it. When it came out, it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I'm not one to send food back, but it was horrible. No flavor at all. I felt bad since I knew they were stressing out with the kitchen issue, but I also didn't think we should pay $17 for something we didn't touch more than a few bites. The manager came out and was nice. Asked if we wanted to try something else or would like a poozkie, but at that time it was late, we had an appetizer and ate the eggrolls, so we were fine. We also didn't want to be stuck waiting for anything else.  I'm not sure I would go back to that location, but I will give this place 3 stars because the service was great.

Our server was the nicest guy ever. Friendly demeanor, patient, and didn't get our orders wrong (argh! I wish I remembered his name to give him credit!). When he found out that it was a reunion, farewell, and late bday celebration all in one, he was like ""I usually don't do this but..."" When someone says that, you can't help but be curious. He offered to make us a 'pizookie platter'. What is that you ask? Well, I'll just say, It's a monster. It's 4 cookie flavors in a large pizza pan topped with a mountain of ice cream. None of us could finish it (I regret nothing! NOTHING!). Other than our main waiter, other servers were nice and helpful when we asked them to take pictures of us. Our main food and drinks were great, no complaints there. Get the fish and chips (extra tartar) and the berry cider (Jerry Berry, I think it's called).

I get that it's Sunday and you had a busy turn around. Honestly I saw three hostess. I'm sure one of them could have checked the restroom.  The food: We started with Avocado Egg Rolls. They are my favorite and the real reason I went to BJ's last night. The avocado tasted old.  Ordered Wings Extra Hot and sure enough they tasted like traditional. Sometimes it happens so we ordered one more app hoping we'd hit a good one. The Calamari was not Crispy but in fact was SOGGY!! We should have said something earlier but we were starving. I did not want to wait for a remake. Last but not least shared the Jambalaya with Angel Hair. The plate had water in it from the pasta which diluted the flavor. I asked for a side of Cajun Spices hoping to make it better but by the time I got it my food was cold.  I spoke to a manager ( Tall, Slim, Caucasian, Male, & used to work at The Cheesecake Factory) and clearly he didn't really care. He made us feel as if we were out to get a free meal. When we mentioned how we've been coming to Bjs for years, even though we didn't have a premiere rewards card. (Simply because I don't really care for one) He would continue to justify the reason behind each plate mistake. We also mentioned how we haven't had food all day since we were on a long ride home, he said he hadn't eaten all day either. I never speak up to a manager for this reason and yesterday was the first time I ever spoke to a manager with a complaint. It was a total waste of time.  What a failure!

Her bright smile, welcoming personality, and charisma made us feel right at home. While perusing the menu I couldn't find the stuffed baked potatoes. Rebecca assured me that they do still have then on the menu, they are just on the lunch menu now. I was elated, since I had been craving that dish for weeks, and was looking forward to finally getting to go to BJ's so I could have it.   Throughout our meal Rebecca was very attentive and always there whenever we needed anything.  Towards the end of our meal we overheard a regular asking our server how she liked married life. So when she returned to our table we inquired if she is newly married? She told us that she just got married in May. We informed her our wedding was just 3 weeks ago. We congratulated eachother and it was a bonding moment.

I explained what was wrong, and she said she was sorry. She wanted to know if she can get us anything else, we explained we were done and we didn't want anything else (after seeing that we don't have appetite for anything else) she said ok, and only took off the fettuccine Alfredo.

136,Regina P.,"Burbank, CA",16,70,48.0,2.0,2016-02-08,"BJ's has really declined in their service and quality of their food.  On this particular visit, my dad ordered a steak to be well-done and was shocked to see how raw the meat was (I posted a photo). At first, he tried to forget about it and dunk the pieces in some A1, but the texture was chewy and tasted bloody. So, as you can imagine, it was difficult to swallow. I called to speak with a manager and I was surprised by the lack of reaction to my dad's raging red steak. He tried to be reassuring by insisting that my dad was always welcome to have his meal sent back to the kitchen to be fixed. I explained to the manager that my father was a diabetic and couldn't wait for the restaurant to get things right on their second, or perhaps, third try.  I didn't appreciate the direction of our interaction. I felt as though the manager was simply shrugging off the incident as something that happens sometimes, instead of taking full accountability and apologizing on behalf of their error. Although I made it clear that there was no excuse for the raw steak, it still felt like taking it off the bill was pulling teeth for this guy, (though it should have been a no-brainer).  It's unbelievable what customer service has become. I feel like this restaurant needs to be more willing to take responsibility for their mishaps and not try to smooth things over by offering a free pizookie. You can't buy a consumer's loyalty with a hot cookie and vanilla bean ice cream, even if it does sound tempting.  Simply apologizing and not making excuses for your staff's error would've sufficed. Speaking up about the quality of food being sub-par shouldn't be taken lightly. My parents don't go out to eat much and they shouldn't have to settle or wait forever for the staff to get it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120,2.52,2.56,2.736,2.3760000000000003,2.544

I asked the girl after I finished my order how long it will take, she responded about 15-20 minutes. I go and get there around 820 and call in to say I'm here for pick up. One of the waiters comes and takes my card and says we are running a bit behind, it will be like 5-7 min longer. I go ok another 5-7 min isn't that bad. He comes back 10 min later with my card and says the kitchen is backed up and it will be another 5-7 min. At this point I am contemplating to just cancel this order because it's 840 at this point and it's taking too long. I decide to wait anyway and until 852 I call in to cancel and they said oh it's on it's way out sorry for the wait. They brought the order and for the wait they gave an extra order of fries. Nice but it literally took 1 hour from order inception to pick up. I might as well dined inside had I known it would be that long. Isn't the purpose for curbside pick up to be less of a wait time? I know there are glitches here and there and kitchens run a bit slower, but I believe 50 minutes is too long for curbside.

372,Stephh F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,24,14.0,3.0,2016-03-25,"Yes most of these reviews are right service is usually always slow, sometimes the waiter/waitress is super nice sometimes they seem like they do not want to be there at all. So service is 2 out of 5 stars just because of the few friendly ones. The food used to be the best I've ever had even in more expensive restaurants. Their cheddar mashed potatoes are always great as well as the grilled asparagus and I can't forget the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. However, I used to absolutely LOVE the rib eye steak. It was never even close to being bad but recently these past couple of months the steak is usually disappointing. Sometimes it's ok but most of the time is dry and flavorless or cooked to well (I ask for medium) and rarely do they make it amazing like before. I've even sent back the steak a couple of times and it would still come back horrible. Food used to be 5 out of 5 stars now it's barely a 2 just because of the delicious side dishes and desert.  The beer on the other hand never disappoints, I always get the  jerramiah red (something like that) and at first it tasted kinda funky but now I crave it once in a while and would even come here just for the beer. So 4 stars on that. Last is the wait time before being seated, the parking lot is a little weird valet is only 3.50 but most of the time unnecessary. And what a lot of people don't know is that you can call in to be put in the wait list as long as you get there within 30 minutes. I usually do that and get seated within 10 minutes of going in or sometimes right away. Plus the girls in the front desk are usually very friendly.

213,Uncle L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",228,98,,2.0,2016-03-27,"This place is the very definition of mediocrity as far as eating at any sort of chain restaurant. (Yard house, TGI Fridays, etc) Typical ""wait staff doesn't give a shit,"" sat for 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Another 10 minutes at least til the drinks came. Waitress barely checked on us, didn't see her again til we were ready for the check. (Had to flag her down every time) Food was bland and thrown together; boneless chicken wings looked and tasted like they had come out of a microwave. (They barely took the time to toss them in wing sauce, most of them were half covered) No presentation, no passion whatsoever. Just everything thrown onto plates like you got up at 3am and nuked leftovers, then sat down to watch an episode of Roseanne until ""the spins"" wore off because you drank too much.  The lighting in this place sucks, I don't know why it's so bright. It's a lot of rocks & wood ""ale house"" motif, yet have it lit up like a surgical theater. I don't know why there was a 20 minute wait when easily 1/4 of the restaurant was obviously available for seating, empty tables and even whole sections all over the place. The parking ramp is a nightmare, it's horribly designed and way too small.  Trying to eat out anywhere in LA is just abysmal, the service sucks 90% of the time anywhere you go, because it's people that don't give a shit about their job or the customer service, they're just there until they find something better or get that role in a sitcom they moved here for. This BJ's reeked of that attitude, ""sit down, eat, pay, get the fuck out."" It had all the ambience and passion of a school cafeteria.

We obviously told the server and she didn't fuss or anything and she kept apologizing.  Now for the food itself, it was pretty meh. Nothing too special. The burger I had was cooked to my liking but lacked in any sort of flavor. My friends said the same thing about their food. The only thing we all agreed was good was the wings we got as an appetizer. Our drinks were also way too sweet, hence the need for water. We unfortunately didn't get the infamous pizookie because it was getting late and we all just wanted to go home.

I went yesterday again and i ordered chicken alfredo and a lemonade. The chicken alfredo was so good! It's a large portion i couldn't finish it so the price of 15.95 is not bad at all. However the lemonade was not good at all. It was sour.  Service was very great very welcoming young lady and had no problem exchanging our cold food.

Not sure why I haven't written a review yet, but I really needed to after my last experience. We came here last Thursday after my brother's pinning ceremony and figured this would be a quick and smart place to go and have a celebratory dinner. We walked in with 7 of us. They just needed to set the table & had us seated right away. Our server was Jan & she took care of us entirely. Everyone got their own thing, but I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. I always always always get the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms when I'm here. It is so freakin' good. Highly recommend!!!!!!! My parents shared a rack of ribs with their side soups. My brother got the jambalaya. I'm not sure what the rest of our group ordered, but everyone was happy. No complaints. Everything was delicious. I tried some of my parents' & brother's order and everything was cooked & seasoned well. Our server even offered a complimentary pazookie to my brother as we were there celebrating him as a new college graduate. How sweet & kind of her! It was such a special day for him, so I thought it was extremely thoughtful of her to do that for us without us even asking!!!!!!!!!

And the selections of veers and occasional local featured beers is always refreshing. Usually don't have a complaint about this place, which is why we return even after the mishap I'm about to explain. Now... one of their downfalls is an obvious breakdown in the kitchen. For a family who does not eat beef, it was disheartening to be served clam chowder bowls with chili chunks in it, not once but TWICE in the same meal.  Seems like some jack ass in the kitchen did not give enough thought to cross contaminating the soups, and after being told by the manager that he changed the entire clam chowder container, the replacement had chili beans in it too!  After pointing this out, I ordered a grilled cheese with shoestring fries and they attempted to charge me for the soup AS WELL AS the grilled cheese. Needless to say, a simple discussion with the waitress and she made sure all of it was removed from the bill.  It seems like over time, this place is starting to struggle with basic food prep errors, but still a great atmosphere overall.  And despite some of their pitfalls, management usually goes out of their way to fix issues and make accommodations to show their apologies instead of it just being lip service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=240,3.28,2.89,2.816,2.1879999999999997,3.0460000000000003
268,Cody R.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,4,3.0,1.0,2016-04-24,"Let me just start this off by saying what wonderful things we had heard about BJ's Brewhouse. My boyfriend is a beer connoisseur, and was excited to go to a local brewhouse. We go out frequently, we enjoy divulging in new foods, drink & experiences overall.        That being said, we were extremely disappointed in Burbank's BJ's Brewhouse.  We sat down at an unset table, I am a server/bartender myself so we always are the first to be understanding of other circumstances, busy restaurants, oversat severs etc. so no big deal to begin.        When our waitress did come over, neither of us were quite ready to order but my boyfriend ordered a beer none the less right away, then pressingly asked if we had decided on appetizers or entrees, we had sat down 2 minutes prior - who would have been ready to place drinks, appetizers & entrees at that point?         His beer came and I ordered one for myself and a small appetizer right after. Our appetizer came before my beer did. She asked again when she dropped off my beer if we were ready to order and did not ever ask how the appetizer was. When at that point, no we were still not ready, she seemed annoyed with us. We ordered fried artichokes with a lemon aoli, the artichokes inside were barely cooked and slid right out of the fried battered around it. Again, we were unimpressed and said nothing. She came back and put our orders in. My boyfriend got the Chicken Barbacoa and I got the Chicken Bacon Siracha Mac & Cheese. When our meals came, they looked nothing like the pictures inside the menu or the descriptions that came with it. They were half the size of the portions shown. We never complain so again, we tried our meals encouragingly and were thoroughly disappointed. My entree had no flavor, the bacon was barely cooked, and I kid you not came with three pieces of broccoli. My boyfriends came with one tiny speck of cilantro and no yogurt crema sauce as it had implied.      In the midst of our meals, our waitress came over, asked how the meal was & offered us dessert while we were still eating.. We declined and ""finished"" soon there after. We waited 15 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we were finished. We waited another 10 minutes for her to return with our check.       We go out very often and are always kind and understanding, but this was such a let down for us. We went in on a Sunday, the place was not extremely busy, and no part of our meals were appetizing or what they appeared. Had we not been starving, we wouldn't have even eaten half of them.      Overall, I can only give BJ's one star, and I do not even think they deserved that. There are so many wonderful places in Burbank, and we will absolutely never be back.

She asked the waiter why they didn't have fountain soda water and he said I thought you wanted mineral water, she replied that she wanted either or, as she originally told him.  We placed our order right after.  I ordered my favorite buffalo chicken pizza no ranch, my friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza no ranch no onions and my other friend ordered the BJ's special (I believe it is called)pizza.  I also placed an order for avocado rolls.  We got the avocado rolls like 10 minutes later, awesome, while we wait for our pizzas!   It was around 10:35 when the waiter came out to tell us that they had burnt our pizzas and they were working on getting new ones out....we were already flustered for waiting so long, but whatever at least he came to tell us.  We got our pizzas and mine or my friend looked NOTHING like the buffalo chicken pizza (as we order this frequently) it had chicken, bacon, cheddar, and who knows what else..... def not what I ordered, but was not going to ask for a replacement and wait 45 more minutes!  I told the waiter that that is not what I had ordered and he swore it was, he said there was nothing else he could do... wtf? ... the the ""buffalo chicken"" pizzas not what we asked for the the BJ special pizza was cold!  We were so upset and disappointed!  This has never happened here!  The waiter told us he spoke the manager and that our meal was comped.  We ate what we could as my pizza still had some burnt on it... and left, but before we left we spoke to the manager and he didn't seem to be in the know prior to the incident.  I hate when you plan on a good meal and it turns out to be a disaster!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=300,3.2,2.82,2.8,2.116,2.9720000000000004

217,Alysha T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,51,31.0,1.0,2016-06-08,"Let's start off the review with how we got seated in a pretty crappy section, right by their extra back door and a servers pos station.  Every other minute a busser, a server on a smoke break, or a customer being directed out by servers. So every 5 seconds the light was shining in on me and my boyfriend face and eyes, the constant door opening and shutting was getting pretty irritating because the light was in and out of our eyes every other second and it was actually getting pretty warm too. OH And the kicker was how loud that table was, the servers literally yelling at the pos station behind my head, the ridiculous noises  coming from outside, and the overall noise of the restaurant. Ok whatever, not that big of a deal right?  My table was sticky, ok still not a big deal.  Our server was polite, and suggested us the queso dip, it came out DELICIOUSSS. What wasn't delicious was the fruit fly/knat that was in it. Ok whatever. It happens. It's a knat, it's tiny it happens when doors get opened. We've all eaten worse. No big deal for me, and this queso dip is the bomb.  We get our I believe it was some sort of guacamole bacon or avocado bacon burger, it was pretty basic nothing special at all, and rather bland to be honest, patty did not seem seasoned with even salt or pepper.  We also had a meat lovers pizza of some sort, also again basic, on the greasy side, and the crust was on the rubbery spectrum of crust, and wasn't delivered with any sort of utensil to actually cut the pizza just our butter knives and forks with our silverware, although servers were constantly behind me not one of them would stop talking to each other long enough to realize I've had my head turned waving my hand in their face asking for some sort of pizza cutter or anything really, that was more helpful to actually cut the pizza.  Once I was finally noticed they sent a server running to grab one she then sliced it for us.  Now desert, the whole reason we all come to BJS right! We now have another server a very awkward, timid server, we basically had to offer ourselves a menu to her, to choose our pizzookies! We got a trio, they sounded amazing and I've eaten at a couple different BJS and have always had the best experiences with their pizzookies,  The only issue was that the cookie was barely luke warm at most on arrival. It reminded me of a sad microwaved Von's cookie that lost any sort of the heat by the time they actually got it to the table.  Kinda bummed, considered still going back for desert again sometime. Until it hit about 10 PM and I felt uncomfortably sick to my stomach, my boyfriend was asleep and woke up around 12 AM feeling exactly the same, and now I'm sure we will NOT GO BACK to this location whatsoever and possibly the chain as a whole because of how bad this experience was, during, and after.  You would think with SEVERAL quality restaurants in the area and a couple opening with outstanding reputations, they would really amp up the service and standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=200,2.6,2.77,2.784,2.436,2.702

NO ""manager"" came to check our table and orders. He only appeared after I complained about the SLOW kitchen service and he being the manager was not making sure his customers were taken care of. He never offered any bread or something to eat while we waited so long for our food. In hindsight, if we had known it would take so long to get our meals, we should have ordered appetizers. Never did we expect to wait 1 hr 15mins after we put in our orders. He did offer to comp the 2 extra late meals, but this won't resolve their internal problems.

Who would say no to a BOGO free offer? Not me so I'm in for another visit and tag along a coworker to share the promo.  We were promptly greeted and led to our table. Although there were several tables in the front, we were assigned a table to at the farthermost section where the bar is so we requested a table nearer the main dining area. They obliged without any objection. We ordered a salmon quinoa bowl ($12.50) and a chicken pesto pizza ($15.50). The salmon was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside. The quinoa and the vegetables were also perfectly cooked. The same goes with the pizza which came with chicken, tomatoes and artichoke. We really enjoyed both the meal so we finished them all. The restaurant is huge and has many tables divided in different sections to give privacy to diners. Customer service is always great every time I come here. The only reason I took off one star is the issue with valet parking. I would fully understand if there's limited parking but on the contrary, there is a huge inside parking lot. As a matter of fact, cars are just parked near the entrance.

The wait time was only 2 minutes even though they were tremendously busy, props to the table turn around ratio for that one. Only reason I took off a star was because of the ticket time... The kitchen was taking awhile. 30 minutes for 3 dishes? Seems crazy. I know it's hard to plan for the right number of cooks, but it seemed as if we were waiting for awhile. The manager even came by to another one of Alec's table to apologize about their food taking so long (even longer than ours).

I've never in my life had such horrible service at any restaurant, like I did last night. I was disrespected as a customer and I will never come back here. After being seated, 15mins go by to order drinks. He messed up our drink order, with no apology. After that, another 15-20 mins to get an order for appetizers. Another 20min goes by, we want to order our meals, hes nowhere. Up to this point, he never checked on us to see how we're doing or for refills on drinks. We finally order our meals, my boyfriend ordered a Medium bbq chicken pizza. When food was brought out, a ""mini"" bbq chicken pizza was brought out. No apology, & he went to get a new pizza. Everyone else finished eating before his pizza was brought out. The pizza came out all doughy with barely any toppings. I called his attention for a box, and with attitude he brought one. I also said our service was really bad. We all needed refills and he never asked the entire table. He defended himself and said, ""I did ask everyone, you just weren't paying attention"". He was very rude the entire time we were there. Being extremely busy as a waiter is understandable, but there's absolutely no excuse for his rude behavior to a customer. I did ask another waitress if I can talk to a manager, but no one ever came. This type of experience needs to be addressed to the waiter himself and all staff.

Last weekend, a small group of us (5 total) came in for a birthday dinner at around 6:30pm. We were seated at a high top in the bar area since there were lots of empty tables. We got our drinks in a timely manner and proceeded to order our entrees (a salad, a small plate of wings, chicken tacos, lemon tyme chicken, and a burger). We talked and hung out....and realized that AN HOUR has passed by and we haven't gotten our food yet. Checked in with the server, and she assured us the food was on its way. 15-20 mins later, the food arrived, except for the burger. The 4 of us were almost done eating when we had to remind the server that we were still missing the burger. 20 mins later, the server came over with the burger, and to collect our empty plates :( A very nice manager came over and asked us if our food was alright, and that he would take off the burger from the bill and offered us complimentary Pazookis, which was unexpected! We probably should've left at this point because the 3 mini pazookis took well over 30-40 mins to arrive. The whole dinner took about 2.5 hours, and the restaurant wasn't at capacity by any means. When we were finally able to flag down our server, we were charged incorrectly, and the desserts were charged as well. At this point, instead of having the bill fixed, we bit the bullet and paid it so we could leave as soon as possible. Bottom line: It was probably a warning sign when all 5 of us started to realize we've all had horrible previous experiences here and traded stories.

However, the order was not what I was expecting. 2 burgers were ordered with no tomatoes, they both had tomatoes. Some people are allergic to tomatoes. 1 burger was ordered on sourdough. Their ""sourdough"" was regular sandwich bread with grill marks on it! 1 burger was ordered with cheese (which is $1 EXTRA!) and there was NO CHEESE! but we were still charged for it. The pazookie was extremely disappointing. I've had delicious pazookies before so I was very excited to indulge and share it. When I opened the cookie, I was shocked!! The cookie was burnt and tiny!!

371,Vicki M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,1.0,1.0,2016-08-16,"We were here 2 days ago for dinner. My great nephew wanted to come for his 18th birthday. There were 7 in our group. We waited a short time to be seated, then we were lead back into a corner booth by a side door and a server station. It was over 100 degrees out and most uncomfortable where we where sat. People kept going in and out of the door, letting the heat in. No air flow back there.    It took awhile for our server to come to our table, were he said he would be right back. He came back and took our drink order, one was wrong. It was corrected. He took our order. About 30 mins later, he brought over a server who he said was relieving him for a break. Another 20 mins later...still no food!!! We called over someone to check on our food. About 10 more mins the food started coming out one by one. It was like our food sat for a long time and was reheated, because the sandwiches had hard crust edges and the ham was hard! The kids pizzas had cheese melted in the plate. My potato wedge fries were burnt to a crisp! Should have taken a picture. They brought out some new ones, but they were taste less. Finally, the last pizza arrived almost 10 mins after the first person was eating.     There was no apology from our server or reason why this happened. We finally had the manager come over and by then I had already told the server to bring me my ticket, cuz I did my meal on a separate check. I had been there way too long and needed to drive a home, which was 30 minutes. I knew the rest of my group wanted to get dessert for the birthday boy, but I had to go. The manager said he could give us a gift card to make up for the poor experience, but since my card had already been ran he could not help me. The rest of the bunch got a $25 card for a bill that was over $90, not including tip. Unfortunately, I will not be going back there, and I was born and raised in Burbank.

131,Melanie W.,"Studio City, CA",378,25,101.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"We came here last weekend and once again regretted it.  I'm not one to complain but sometimes you can become so annoyed and disappointed with a place that you really should say something. When we walked in it was pretty empty and quiet with tons of tables open in the front and back.  There are two separate desk areas in the entrance.  One was empty and the other had three people behind it talking. You could tell that they weren't servers because of their attire.  We stood there as they continued to talk and ignore us and waited until I tried to get their attention.  Someone suggested that we could sit at the bar table tops for happy hour if we would like and we declined because we wanted to sit more comfortably than teetering on some tall stools with tables. More confused conversations ensued and they asked if we would like to sit in the back of the restaurant and we requested to sit in one of the booth areas near the front. They told us that we would have to wait until the hostess returned to seat us and 'make sure that it was 'okay' so we sat down and waited. We were the only two people waiting to be seated.  Five minutes later (finally) this extremely busy hostess in this empty restaurant showed up and asked us if we wanted to sit in 'happy hour' and again we said no thank you can we please sit in the front and she said that's happy hour and I asked about the booths and many tables beside the happy hour and that's when she said I'll have to ask someone first and then she asked  'Would you like to sit in the back?' REALLY?  Seriously? Umm, no.  1st thing-We already had this conversation with someone else   2nd -that's where you should put large parties and families or for when they have a fully packed restaurant. Why would you put a couple of two in the back of a very big empty restaurant? Especially if they already asked to be seated in a different section already. It's insulting. Listen, I know the drill.  You have servers in certain areas and it's your job to farm tables for sections and their servers. I get it, but don't put guilt trips on customers because they don't want to sit there and try to make them feel like they are being difficult.  Unacceptable. Smile and say of course. Next we get our waitress who was a bit intense.  She seemed irritated or something. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer (they never came out) our server didn't even notice until after our salads and we were eating our meal. (Another thing that I would like to mention here is that the wait staff doesn't even bring the food to your table and I know that's common now and I get it-but the waiter or waitress should always come over and make sure everything is thumbs up) Plus how can you be soooooo busy when you don't even have to bring out the food???  Seriously?  I just don't understand.  I was a waitress in one of the busiest restaurants in town. She was nowhere to be found 95% of the time. When she finally realized it she said 'you still want those wings right?' and I said 'no, it's okay' and she got irritated and huffed off.  This brings me to the food. Every meal that I've had has always been sub-par.  Everything tastes very bland and mass produced.  There's not a lot of love in what they serve, or a very good palate. The selection (book) menu doesn't feel right.  It's way too large and Overwhelming-while the food is Underwhelming. The golden rule is don't try to do everything just do some things really well.  Anyway, it was my man's birthday and still trying to make the best of the situation we ordered the cookie with ice cream. I think they call it a Pizookie?? it came out hard as a rock.  You couldn't even put a fork in it.  It was terrible.  The whole experience was terrible. Like a bad dream. The hostess was difficult.  The waitress was difficult and the food doesn't cut it.  Their only saving grace is their beer selection. I'm not going to name our server because I don't want to point her out specifically-but her attitude stinks.  Maybe one of the managers will note that she was working the front bar and seating area last Friday.  Maybe she was in a bad mood that day but who cares? not us when we're trying to have a nice dinner. I've worked in two different restaurants and the first rule is to leave your emotions at the door. especially if you want to make money. Her attitude is affecting your business because we won't be coming back.  Any suggestion that I would have is to change your staff or do some retraining and remind them that they are in customer service. They seem to be more preoccupied in conversations with co workers and giving attitude more than making a pleasurable dining experience. Also try to make a better smaller menu. We go to dinner three times a week and we've given this place more than a few tries and this was our last.

Well, what used to be a spot to visit on occasion, this experience will definitely deter from that. Our food took quite a long time for a couple of sandwiches, one cold and one hot. When our food finally arrived, my french fries weren't what I ordered and my sandwich was cold. Sarah was kind to send it back to the kitchen and bring me hot and fresh fries while I waited for my fresh sandwich. I had ordered it WITHOUT BACON, I want that to be clear from the get-go! When my sandwich came back, it was hot but had bacon in it. That was unfortunate. I brought it my server's attention and she apologized profusely. She asked if a wanted another one and at that point, it wasn't worth it. I ordered the salad I should have ordered to begin when perusing the large menu of options. The manager came over and said ""I heard there was a problem with your sandwich and we'll take care of it for you."" I told him how the first one was cold, and the second one had bacon in it. He quipped ""It didn't."" Shocked by how the 'customer is always right' didn't apply, I said, ""I know it did, sir."" He said, again, as matter of factly, ""I'm telling you didn't."" Appalled by how rude this man was speaking to me, I said, ""I'm telling you that it did."" And he then had the audacity to say, ""it was probably an overcooked piece of chicken that you mistook it for."" Whoa, are you kidding me? So now am I not only ""wrong"" but it's okay to serve a guest overcooked meat?! Wow. I tried to keep the smile on my face and not the show the disgust I felt in the pit of my stomach. He then walked away.  Off the look of my friend, who was equally mortified, I asked if I had come off to him in any way that would warrant him to speak to me so passive aggressive and condescending, and she said ""no."" I flagged our server over and thanked her, and mentioned that the manager had come over to address the food issues, by being beyond rude to me as a customer and basically called me a liar. She also was extremely apologetic. So sir, I now know you're the GM of that location and I will let your corporate office know what a jerk you were to a customer. The fact of the matter is this, I don't go out to eat often but when I do, I expect great service from top to bottom. The kitchen doesn't have it's stuff together because they messed up the order three times. Your food runners should get the food to the table faster so it's hot when served, then I suppose this situation wouldn't have happened to begin with.

Originally we were seated by the smaller bar in a smaller 2-top booth, but we were uncomfortably warm sitting there so we asked if it was possible to move to a different spot (in which case we were moved to a bigger booth close by with a much better & comfortable temperature.  We were told about the 2 for $25 deal so we pursued it and Adam was very willing to explain what we could get. We ordered the 2 salads, a medium pepperoni w/ jalapeños and bacon, and a Cookies N' Cream pizookie. All of it was amazing and it only came out to $25 plus tax. Of course had to get a pitcher of their delicious Brewhouse Blonde Pale ale so our bill came out to roughly $47 or so.  I was a little disappointed in finding out that I wasn't credited my BJs rewards points as I had asked, but maybe I will contact the restaurant in hopes to getting them back, haha.

I have been in this restaurant numerous times and the service has always been slow but last night it was shambolic. We were a party of nine, got seated almost immediately and the place wasn't particularly busy. The service was typically slow but within the realms of being tolerable. However, when our food eventually arrived, the items that come with fries were served without the fries and our server explained the fries were not ready but would be out shortly. So four of us sat there with half our meal, one of the meals was supposed to be fish AND chips (which didn't come with tartar sauce). The fries did eventually get served. One diner ordered a steak, cooked medium and it was served rare so that had to go back to the kitchen. We waited ages and had to ask our server where the steak was before he fetched it and by that time everyone else had finished eating. There were a lot of other fairly minor things that spoiled the experience but I won't list them. We complained to the manager and she was very apologetic and deducted the four items that came with fries from our check. The food was decent, the server was doing his best but he was new and it wasn't entirely his fault.

The service: From the very beginning at the hostess stand was below mediocre. There was a 20-25 minute wait that turned into a 35 min wait. That's not the problem. There were at least 12 tables open yet 20 people waiting to be seated. None of the 4 people at the hostess stand had a welcoming attitude. Then I noticed people after me were being set first. Annoying.  The waitress: For whatever reason the waitress had a new hire shadowing her (the standards must be really low). She was sweet but not great at what she does. But then again maybe she was just busy.... but still you're a waitress. Another waitress had to bring me silverware and she acted as if I'd ruined her day.  Outside of taking my order, she checked on me once which I then asked for my check. It took 10 minutes to get it. Then I have her my card right away... another 10 mins. It was really difficult to only tip her 20% of the check (because it was a $25 check). I normally would leave at least 50% if not a 100% tip for such a small check (especially since it's the holidays).  The guy shadowing though, seems like he will be great at serving. He came by a few times on his own accord while walking by following the other waitress.  The food: While didn't expect a Michelin experience the food was very basic and tasted like something from a cafeteria. My 9 year old said that this place deserved only 2 stars because of the long wait and basic tasting food.  Anyway...

One of the last times we came to this restaurant there was a super long black hair in my boyfriends salad which was met with zero empathy and I felt like I was begging for a fork. Tonight just further justified my last review. First I was told to input my phone number so I could be texted when my table was ready. We grabbed a drink in the bar and when our friends arrived the host told us they had tried calling us for our table a while ago. Why did I put in my number again? Anyway, the waiter was so absent from the table it was unreal. It was at least 20 minutes between sightings and some of those weren't even for our table. We waited a good 20 minutes for our first round and another 20 for the second. There were no napkins or utensils on the table. We had finished our appetizer and they were finally bringing the food out before I even had the opportunity to ask for them. Then he only brought 2 utensils even though there were 4 of us at the table. If he had been more attentive he probably could have sold 2 more rounds of drinks but we didn't see him often enough. It felt like we had to ration the drinks we did have because who knew when we might get more. The restaurant was busy but I didn't see him serving any other tables until they sat a large party nearby (which he shared with another waiter). Whenever I looked around he was nowhere in sight. Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant if not the worst. The only reason I keep coming back is because the food is, for the most part, (minus the hair) very good.

Waitress brought drinks right away and took our order then proceeded to flirt with a table in the bar which seemed to be her friends from high school, was not surprised. Salad and soup came out a little slow but not horrible. Now is when it gets exciting. The food expeditor brought out our food and gave it to the table across from us. The table accepted the salad which was a BBQ chicken salad but turned away the flat bread pizza. The other table started to chow away at the salad and made comments that this does not seem like what they order and we laughed. About 10 mins later our waitress decides to pull away from her high school friends and comes by our table and asks ""is there anything else I can get you"" ummm yeah what about our meal? She was dumbfounded with a blank stare. She obviously was not paying attention to anything but her high school boy friends. She said she would look into it. We waited another 20 mins with twice asking the pre occupied waitress where are meal is and she only once went back into the kitchen as she was too enthralled with her ""friends"". Finally we ask a different waitress and another waiter to get the manager and nothing for 10 mins, NOTHING. Our waitress walks by and we ask her for the manager and he/she never shows. We get up to leave and I mention to the front desk that we are leaving and to let the manager know since he can't be bothered to come talk to us that we are leaving and he can take the salad and soup off of our bill. And now the plot thickens..... As we are waking out the door a young deer in the headlights manager comes up and ask if he can help us. We explained everything to him and he says "" well I just got here at 5pm and have only been here for 9 minutes and proceeds to pull out his smart phone and show me the time, really? REALLY manager Mark? Wow no apology, no solution nothing. I ask him if there was no manager on duty prior to his arrival and he says he didn't know. Again, really?

This place was the nightmare you always hear about,  but have yet to experience. Where do I start? After a 30 minute wait, we were seated in the upper corner of the place. The waiter was a nice guy, attentive to entering our order. I assume he entered the selections correctly on his tablet device,  but it started with my daughter getting a strawberry lemonade when she asked for a regular lemonade. She's particularly self conscious about attention and makes it clear, even though it's wrong, ""it's fine."" Our order staggered to the table, yet one thing after another was wrong. My burger was cold and lacked the normal amount of mayonnaise and also the tomatoes I requested on it. Mayo lettuce tomato and cheese is simple, yet their kitchen showed that they could screw it up on another level. Then came the pizza we ordered, oh wait, the delivery person, not our waiter,  gave us someone else's pizza. Our waiter came over and took it back. About 10 minutes later,  the waiter was heading our way with what appeared to be our actual pizza. Somewhere on the stairs up, the pizza dropped to the floor just 15 feet away from our table. He apologize and said they would get working on a new one. By the time we were eating it, most of the place had left for the night. In the end, the $13 burgers sucked. The baked Ziti was bland and left much to be desired. The right pizza took FOREVER. AND it seems that the management was like a absent landlord. After the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant,  there was zero contact about how they would make it right. How can management be this oblivious to such horrible service? Instead we received our bill which exceeded $90, zero courtesy credit for the messed up order or the complete inconvenience of the pizza issue, or the horrible burgers. Go here at your own peril.

51,Shirley T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,16.0,1.0,2017-06-09,"So am writing this review as we leave the restaurant. There are a couple of things that went wrong with today and most of it has to do with the long wait and service. I would normally not mind such things but it is different when I see the staff chatting and having personal conversation among each other and several empty tables. First we put or name in for a table with the girl at the front and was told 15 minutes, no problem. Then as we are sitting there with no one else waiting, it seems the girl at the host table leaves and the gentleman takes her place but not before chatting it up for about 15 minutes. We continue to wait another 10 minutes or so and the gentleman asks us if we are waiting for take out. I tell him no and that we are waiting for a table. He then says ""omg why did no one tell me, let me get you a table"". Apparently the girl didn't notify him of our wait.  Once we get a table we sit there and look at the menu without getting acknowledgement. Normally I wouldn't mind especially if it is busy but we had quite a few tables around us that were empty. We figure out what we all want to order and are still waiting. By this time a little less than 10 minutes have passed. Our waiter then comes over and tells us he will be right with us. Then a few minutes pass and another group gets seated next to us. The waiter goes to them and gets their drink orders while we are still waiting with no drinks or having put any orders in. We then see the waiter go in and out of the kitchen several times and stop to have personal conversation with coworkers. By this time it has been a little under 15 minutes of just sitting at the table totaling about 40 minutes. By this time we were done and angry so we walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=60,2.76,2.26,2.464,2.2760000000000002,2.46

It took 15 minutes from the time we sat down before they even asked about drinks, took our entire order. My wife's beer came relatively fast, our cheese sticks came out. We had to ask for the two remaining drinks, one water and one strawberry lemonade. Explanation, they had to get the lemonade from the back. But how long does it take to get water. We had a coupon for a free appetizer and two gift cards. We ordered two deserts which they comped because of the slow service. I reminded them of the free appetizer when I gave them the gift cards. I estimated the amount of the check, when I got it back I owed $16, but they could not get the one gift card to work because of system issues. The amount was higher than I expected, I asked for the check, was handed the wrong one, we were a table of three adults and I was handed a check with kids meals on it. I finally got the check and saw they had not take off the appetizer. We went over the check, the free appetizer and the one gift card, we estimate a credit of $4. I left an $8 additional tip.

31,Jem K.,"Irvine, CA",3,145,380.0,2.0,2017-07-30,Came here around 430 and they said 10-15 min wait. i looked around there were alot of empty tables. So we just assumed not alot of servers to cover the whole area. So we waited and waited and waited... and we finally got called after 30mins.:)  Food: Great white Deepdish pizza 14in. - dont expect Chicago deep dish. It's ok. a bit salty. Enough to feed 5 people with 2 slices for leftovers. Avocado roll - my favorite dish! 2 rolls had the spicy taste to it.. some just had plain avocado. i remember it being really good but today it was ok. I mean... i'd order it again.. today just felt off maybe? Calamari - crunchy good ol' calamari. Deep it in marinara. Yum.:)  Shrimp and asparagus pasta - bland. we smothered it with cheese and crushed red peppers. Had like 3-5 pcs of shrimp? Dry and a bit undercooked. Will probably not order this again. TIP: if you download their app and use mobile Pay... U get to free mini pizookie!

I use to go with a couple of friends every once in a while and when i did go we would usually get ignored by our own server because he is way too focused on the bigger party next to us. Mind you i always tip 15 percent and i always try to be polite because i use to worked in the food industry but the people working at BJ's lack proper training. Not only do they ignore you but the one time i go with my family to celebrate a few day after my sister graduation they made us wait a hour for our food because the system went down and instead of apologizing the server had the guts to tell my cousin waiting a 1 hour and 30 min for a party of eight is the norm and gave a lot of attitude when we ask when is our food was coming. Not only did the food came late but it was also cold. To stop us from leaving the manager promised us to give us a pizookie on our next visit instead of there and now and when we asked if we can get a coupon or a written agreement he told us he told us he would honor his word and when we did come back he lied to our faces and said he does not remember that and played ignorant till we left. All in all the service is terrible unless your in a big party, the manager is a liar, and the food is not even that great it comes out lacking flavor, cold, and might have egg shells in it. BJ is expensive for no good reason when the service is terrible and the food is not even that great.

I'm sorry to say that the Parmesan crusted chicken was not prepared in the same way that it is prepared at other locations. Lemon cream was cold, poorly blended and inedible.

FOOD: the quality of the food is nothing like it used to be, I used to order the Parmesan chicken or fettuccini Alfredo, they were made to perfection, and ALWAYS hit the spot. Well not anymore! Not sure why the Parmesan chicken has dry tomatoes sprinkled over it now, still a bit pink and bland! The mashed potatoes used to be covered in a delicious sauce, not anymore.  It seems like they cut back on a lot, especially the warm delicious complimentary bread and butter they used to serve. We were super hungry so we ordered bread to eat while we waited. cost (5.99), but our food got there first! So it was pointless and we canceled it. The grilled chicken pasta, is not what it used to be. It taste like pieces of chicken that were frozen, warmed up and tossed over pasta. Not the fresh off the Grill tasting chicken Over a creamy Alfredo pasta I remember! I won't get started with the pizza =(  WAIT TIME: took way too long to get our food considering it wasn't busy. We were seated right away, and there were plenty of empty tables. How ever, it took about 40 min to get served!

I ordered the prime rib dip with white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got the sliders with French fries. The girl ringing us up was very friendly and accommodating. However, when we got back to the hotel to eat I was unpleasantly surprised. My prime rib dip was bright red in some spots and then gray in others. It looked extremely unappetizing. To top it off my mashed potatoes had MOLD on them. Yes, mold. I immediately contacted the restaurant and waited on hold several minutes to speak with a manager. I explained to him the situation and even offered to bring the food back. He then argued with me and said that they cook their prime rib to medium rare and if I brought it back he could cook it longer for me if I wanted. I said I would just prefer a refund and he said in order for me to get a refund I'd have to come back and he would have to reauthorize a charge for the entire meal on my card again (which would come off who knows when) and then I would get a refund (who knows when). I declined and he said he'd have his manager email me a gift card in, also, an undefined amount of days. I am now disgusted, without dinner, and without a refund.

My youngest daughter did not like the pizza so I had to order solders for her.... not only did it take another 35 minutes but the server brought it in a to go plate knowing that we were waiting so could eat. This was just the beginning.... the server was nice about it and it was ok. Our total came out to 55.37. My mom gave 20 cash and I told the server he could put the rest on my card. Well I checked my account today and I was charged THREE times! One for the total 55.37, the second for 20.00 and the third for 34.37 I was furious because they didn't even tell me.

28,Evelin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,13,1.0,1.0,2017-12-28,Because we got seated and literally every waiter just passed us by and ignoring us. This is not the first time we been treated like this at a BJS the waiters only care for the nice dressed  people vs anyone else and dont care  if a client waits there for more than 15 mins to just get even asked if they want water. This place needs to rethink on how they treat i guess regular clients.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=20,2.0,2.23,2.256,,2.1380000000000003

7,Allen A.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,12,1.0,1.0,2017-12-31,"I was planning to eat across the street but the wait was to long so we decided to eat here. My wife had the salmon and I had the pork chops with a bowl of claim chowder. Salmon was good but her veggies were very soggy. As I was eating my pork chops I notice the farther I ate to the center the more raw it got. At this point I did talk to the waitress and she said after she talked to the cook that they cook it to 165° and if you want it cooked more you must request it? I just want it cooked, she didn't even look at my food just trusted what the cook said. Come on customer gets raw food on his table get the manager and look at the food,  It's that simple. dam I should have read yelps reviews before I came here. My mistake!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank,1.92,2.27,2.256,,2.1300000000000003
30,Jay W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",144,1,,1.0,2018-01-01,"So me and my friends go to Bj's for food after universal and this was the closest one. We've been to BJs before and we thought it was great so we just hopped over to this one because we were starving. This was undeniably the worst decision of the night. Keep in mind we're just a group of four college kids and wanted food. The first thing that happened was the cups they brought out were plastic. At first we thought it was just like whatever but we looked around and someone ordered a drink so I thought that was why they got a glass. But after looking more I found that everyone else who ordered water got a glass except for us. The waitress came back and explained there were no cups left and that was fine until the party who just sat down right after us got their water and it was in a glass. Second when our food came out my friend and I ordered the exact same thing but the difference was that his platter had the full dish on it while mines had 4 pieces of broccoli and noodles. I searched underneath to look for the rest and found none so I called the waitress and I was surprised to see her serving the table behind me. I made sure she saw my hand raised for help and thought that she would come after only she left for a couple more minutes before coming back. Alright so whatever that's all fine. But once she came and. I notified her that there was barely any broccoli while showing her (literally moving it all around and lifting the noodle) she said ""oh it's under the noodle"". To which I just lifted it again and asked her if I could have more. I thought this would be the end of the trouble but after she brought back my plate of food and I began to eat I discovered a clump of undercooked pasta in it. I thought it was just me being picky but I wasn't feeling like finishing so I asked my friend if he wanted the rest and he ate it and said it tasted funny and that the other one that was brought out tasted a lot better. At this point I gave up on the dish and just wanted to leave except my friends wanted to get a pizookie so I just went along with it. Only when we ordered the pizookie we asked for a refill on the water. Only the refill never came and for that matter, no one ever came around to offer us a refill on our plastic cups of water. That's the end of my story of the night. Hopefully this was just a minor problem because their a new startup(according to yelp) but if I were to be honest, the only reason I gave a 1 is because yelp won't let me give them a 0.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=20,1.88,2.23,2.244,,2.0900000000000003
1,Chris S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2018-01-01,"Honestly this is the 3rd or 4th time this place has let me down. I came last time and the same waiter messed up my friends drink and switched it with a couple that was behind us, only reason we knew it was her drink, because there was lipstick on my friends drink. Then we told the waiter ""hey this is the wrong drink, it's not my drink"" he said its your drink and began walking away. So that was like in September 2017 idk what day. I kept it cool cause I like bj's but TODAY IM WRITING A REVIEW BECAUSE I CAME IN AND GOT THE SAAAAAAAAAAAMEEEE DUDE.!!.! Like bro quit alrdy.... right off the back I knew it was him.. stayed quiet and told my girlfriend about it. So I ordered a burger then I got my food and asked the server who brought it, hey can I get some ranch, he ignored me and I saw him help somebody else. Ok that was annoying and I'm waiting nearly 15mins after getting my food with no refill or ranch. So I drank my girlfriends water and ate my food then this dude still has the NERVE to bring me RANCH.?!?!? All I gotta say is I'm NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER COMING BACK.!! I'm mentioning to all my co workers and everyone I bumped into in Burbank.! #TheyNeedBetterCustomerService",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank,1.88,2.23,2.244,,2.0900000000000003
19,Nav B.,"Irvine, CA",239,2,,1.0,2018-01-06,"Upon our visit to this BJ's location, we were seated at a dirty table with no utensils. It took 15 minute for the waitress to get our drink order and another 10 to bring us our drinks. The food was cold and we were offered sharing plates when we were almost done eating. We finished eating and it took the waitress another 20 minutes to come take our dessert order. The pizookie came out cold and hard. To add onto that, we were not offered a refill on any of our drinks. We waited for the waitress to pick up the check, yet it took another 20 minutes and we had to go up to the front to see if we could pay there. Extremely dissatisfied with the experience and will never come to this location in the future. Also the waitress seemed like she did not want to be there and gave off a very unpleasant vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank,1.76,2.19,2.232,,2.0180000000000002

He was really friendly and understood us and was just genuinely happy to help! Also, my incredibly picky mom loved her food so bonus! And my vegetarian deep dish ziti was perfect.

16,G H.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",1,29,1.0,4.0,2018-01-10,"On a family vacation. Stopped here just because we were driving around looking for a place to have dinner. Dinner was great!  We had Fire Roast Chicken Barbacoa, Chicken Alfredo (good size portion), create your own pizza (deep dish), BJs Brewhouse Classic Pizza (thin crust) and the Mediterranean Pita Taco. Food was very good.  Service was fast. Friendly waitress. Good family atmosphere.  Create your own pizza was over priced (yikes!!$16.50 for a small!!).  Overall, good place to stop. Note to BJs:  take a brush to your sinks in the bathrooms. Gross!!!  In less than 5 min they could look decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank,1.84,2.2,2.232,,2.056
