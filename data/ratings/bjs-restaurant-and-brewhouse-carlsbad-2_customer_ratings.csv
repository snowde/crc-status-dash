548,Anna M.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,53,,4.0,2012-01-06,I have been to a few BJ's Breweries in various areas and they all seem to be consistent with their food. Their Great White Pizza is delicious. I came here for a late lunch and sat in the bar. Their beer was discounted (happy hour???) and the Avocado Egg Rolls are flippin' fantastic. I am giving it a 4 star because I am not entirely blown away by their beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=600,3.48,3.22,3.22,3.2800000000000002,3.3240000000000007

551,Robert L.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,5.0,4.0,2012-01-22,Great food and awsome lunch specials.  Service is usually GREAT but they can get a bit overwhelmed.  We go for luch at least twice a month.  Great burgers and their Ahi salad is to die for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=600,3.48,3.24,3.24,3.2800000000000002,3.3360000000000007
658,Glenn C.,"Vista, CA",64,120,216.0,5.0,2012-01-23,"Five stars...lofty I know, but hear me out! BJ's has a winning combination that simply cannot be ignored.  Its lacks that home town, eclectic feel that so many, including myself cherish.  Its not super high end or dirty cruddy.  Its just right.  BJ's is the kind of place that caters well and respectfully to a family as well as making it a grown ups paradise to watch the game or other significant sporting event on the HUGE screens.  If you are looking for a frat party you need not apply, SoCal is replete with that type of establishment and this one is NOT one of them.  I do not have a family but I enjoyed watching the playoffs with my wife over their delicious spinach and artichoke dip.  The food is always hot and delicious.  I favor the specialty calzone for two just don't forget to ask for a little extra marinara.  They have a decent selection of micro brews that make for an interesting and fun evening with some friends while you watch the game.  The Ahi poke is also great and they do not skimp on the ahi so wifee loves to get the poke... Happy hours that are worth the time and effort are not as common as they used to be but this is one of them.  Worth the time to check out the happy hour hour specials.  I enjoyed 1/2 off select bottles of wine on one evening and some shared appetizers as well!  Bottom line is if you are a mature adult that still enjoys a good time and doesn't mind a few little ones around then this place is awesome for its atmosphere, decor, food, service and BEER!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=560,3.52,3.28,3.28,3.3480000000000003,3.3760000000000003
471,Tammy C.,"Encinitas, CA",222,64,,4.0,2012-01-24,"This place gets pretty busy throughout the day, but I haven't had to wait too long for a table. I like going to BJ's with a big group, because it's easier to share a pizza. The best deal they have is the 2 for $20 deal. This includes 2 bowls of soup or salad, a medium pizza (upgrade to large for about $3) and a pizookie of your choice! This deal easily feeds 3-4 people. The pizza here is the best, they have many flavors and you can get two different kinds on one pizza. My favorite part of the pizza is the thick crust. The reason BJ's is famous is for their pizookies, which are delicious oven baked cookies with ice cream on top. My favorite pizookie is the cookies and cream one! I only recommend going to BJ's with the 2 for $20 deal, because it can get pretty pricey without.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=480,3.6,3.3,3.3,3.184,3.4200000000000004
461,Susan W.,"San Diego, CA",61,94,1.0,3.0,2012-01-31,"I've been to many different BJ's over the years and the food, while not mind-blowing, has always been consistently tasty.  Went to this specific BJ's, after running the Carlsbad. We didn't have a reservation and our group mushroomed from 7 to 9 to 14 people!  The manager was very accommodating and was able to get us all seated together with only about a 15-20 minute wait; it was after the Carlsbad half and full marathon, and it was the AFC and NFC championship games, so it was pretty packed.   Disclaimer: I've been known to get cranky when I'm hungry so you can imagine the feeling of uber-cranky after burning several hundreds of calories running a half, so take my complaint with a grain of salt if you want!  Our food took about 40 minutes to come out, which is a long time to be waiting at this type of restaurant.  Our waiter also never once said anything acknowledging the fact that our food was taking so long either, which I find annoying.  Also, our waiter was really slow with things like water refills...though interestingly, was always keen to find out if we wanted more beers! lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=480,3.56,3.29,3.29,3.1160000000000005,3.398

My favorite times have been with my hubby when we go to get some drinks and share the Mediterranean pizza, which, by the way, is DELICIOSO! It has pesto, chicken, feta cheese, and pepperoncinis... Ummm to die for!!!! I also LOVE their avocado egg rolls.... Which are AMAZING.  They have a great selection of their speciality beers, as well as margaritas, mojitos, sangria.... Etc.  They also have a light menu option, where some options include chicken pizza, and fish tacos. I've had both and have not been disappointed. They usually get busy, do if you're going on the weekend I suggest calling ahead of time.

210,Lindsey P.,"Carlsbad, CA",511,412,454.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"AIGHT. Nothing special going on here. Taking the craft of pub-ish style food and brewing beer and commercializing it. I haven't been unhappy with any of my visits here, but also haven't been impressed by anything in particular.  I'm glad they opened in Carlsbad, but would be cool if they had local beers on tap and local produce (ummm...the strawberry fields are literally seconds away!). That would really set them apart from all of the other touristy things to do.

588,Rachel S.,"Brisbane, Australia",305,192,253.0,2.0,2012-03-22,"I feel like the concept of this place is more appreciated than the food and service. Yes, the bar is trendy and open til 1am on some nights and the building is huge with high ceilings and decorated walls, but the food is just average and the service is nothing special. I went to BJ's to celebrate Valentines day with my boyfriend, I ordered a pasta dish which was supposed to come in a creamy marinara/alfredo sauce, sounds good but I can't have dairy so I asked for just plain marinara and even explained that I really can't have dairy and the waitress seemed confident that they could help me out with that.  Of course, my pasta comes out, in a creamy orange sauce. I didn't eat until the waitress came back and I showed her my pasta, she first said ""Are you sure this is creamy?"" and then she was like ""Oh yea it is, sorry about that"" and took it back for me which was nice.  Honestly the wait wasn't worth it, the pasta was average and I could make it at home, overcooked noodles are my specialty. My boyfriend did love the Jumbalaya he ordered though! Also, we ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer, which were VERY good, but we paid about $10 for a TINY bowl of the chicken which barely fed just the two of us. More recently, my family and I came to BJ's to show our relatives from out-of-town what this place was like (they love Cheesecake factory so this was the closest thing to it). The service was HORRIBLE. There were 8 of us and each couple ordered an appetizer, so we had about 6 appetizers ordered, the appetizers came out right when the main courses did which left us with literally no room and confusion on what to eat. We let the waiter know that we were not happy with that, so the manager came to our table and told us we didn't have to pay for the appetizers, which was really nice! One of the main courses, didn't come out at all, so my poor grandma had to sit and wait for her fish and chips to make their way to the table. When the bill came, we were charged automatically for the gratuity because we had 8 people, which they didn't deserve. My brother-in-law wanted to pay for his meal seperately which was fine, but when they brought him his reciept, they over-charged him by $6 AND charged him the automatic gratuity! Which made no sense because he was paying for only his meal and my sisters, which equals 2 people BJ's! TWO!!  We left pretty unhappy, my dad swears he'll never go there again. I will, because I LOVE the Pizookie's, but that's about it :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=580,3.52,3.27,3.27,3.1120000000000005,3.37
406,Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48.0,4.0,2012-03-22,I was taken for a Lunch to BJ I had the chicken salad I gave 4 stars is because when I asked for Olive oil as a dressing they did not have it. The salad was delicious and to drink I had the Arnold Palmer . Parking here is tight at Lunch time as the area is full of automotive dealerships. I had ordered the sesame seed chicken but I though I just got the plain chicken salad. The portion was enough to fill you up.

I don't drink beer but I got my father to go here and he loved all the different beers they had on tap that was the restaurants own crafts.  The only down sides to this restaurant is that  1) your waiter can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they're nice and other times they're rude.  2) I've had certain food items like the ribs, be out of stock, or whatever they call it, twice before. Both times, the waiter didn't come out and tell me till after waiting for 10 minutes. 3)The parking lot is somewhat tight and can get packed very easily. 4)It gets very loud in here and although they have maybe 10 flatscreens up in there, usually it's only sports and more than once, it was the same game on every single tv.

The cookies they have are Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Red Velvet, Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate. The ice creams are vanilla and chocolate. I am absolutely positutely sure that any combination of cookie and ice cream is ridiculously good! In case you're wondering, yes I did eat my dinner first.  I had the grilled chicken club sandwich with wedgie fries.  The sandwich was good, great value with fresh ingredients.  I did only eat half of the sandwich, in hopes of having dessert.  The other half was still good when I toasted and ate it the next day for lunch. Service from our two waiters was ok. I say just ok because I had asked the female waitress for more hot water, she forgot so I asked the guy for more hot water and a take-out box. He brought the hot water but forgot the box.

310,Jennifer D.,"Carlsbad, CA",93,172,69.0,2.0,2012-06-23,"I have been to this location a few times before but nothing stellar enough to yelp about. Our visit last night will probably be our last as it resulted in me complaining to the manager and I NEVER do that. We were seated promptly on the patio outside, it wasn't too crowded yet as it was only 5:30.  Our waiter came (I will keep his name private as to not embarrass him, but it rhymed with ""Lyle"" and started with a ""K"") and took our drink order, all nonalcoholic but one and all arriving 20 minutes later. As he took our order, he would repeat back the items we ordered and they were not correct. For example, I asked for potato skins, and he would say ""OK, and an order for fried artichokes?"". NO LYLE, that's not what I said. The potato skins were way over cooked. The calamari was OK.  The best was when our table was littered with dirty dishes and empty glasses because he hadn't come by to clear them or offer us a refill, and another server comes whipping out of the patio door with a pizza and says ""Um, can you move your stuff out of the way, this pizza is hot and heavy and I'm about to drop it.""  You know what, no, I can't.  How about you bring that pizza stand thingy and some plates before you come out here full speed with a pizza and threaten me. Lyle comes by now to check how everything is. Well, my husband hadn't been brought his dinner. Any restaurant knows you serve the entire table at the same time. This is when I call a manager over. He apologizes and offers to comp husbands dinner. When the check comes, no comp. So of course, that's another 5 minute wait and then another 10 minutes for him to run my credit card and then bring me the slip to sign...with no pen. Find a new job, Lyle. For a chain restaurant in a busy location (across from the company stores outlet), they need to make a better effort to hire competent waiters who can handle the vast menu and heavy flow of people. They line to get in was bananas when we left.

I have been to fine dining places and never have been treated as i was treated here. Jennifer was our waitress and she was on it. I thought it and without asking she delivered. I could not believe it. The food was great I had ordered ahi salad and a pizza. The ahi salad was crispy and the ahi had a great taste. The pizza had just the right amount of sauce and toppings on it. The dough was crispy but not hard and not too chewy in the middle. i would get down to 1/3 of my drink and before I could look up to find Jennifer she was already on her way over to fill my drink. I have gone places (not going to mention any names....Jays Gormet)  that i had waited 20 minutes to get a water. I was so impressed by this waitress I asked her to send her manager over. She looked at me so puzzled, didnt argue just went and got him. When they both came back, she started walking away I stopped her and asked her to come back. She looked so stressed. I started telling the manager how impressed I was and this is by far the best service I have ever received. I continued on and on (so did the rest of my party) by the time we were done she was smiling from ear to ear. We left her a 50% tip.  Here is the bad news....

My first instinct was to make reservations at Pacific 333; however, when I called at 5pm they told me that 8 pm was the earliest I could get our party of 7 in. With relatives still on the road at an ETA of around 6:30 pm, I called BJ's and made a reservation for 7 at 7pm. When someone answered the phone with ""whats up"" I should have just hung up. I asked if she could take my reservation and she said ""yes"", and then started telling me about some call ahead policy that they have. Apparently, they will take your reservation but you must call ahead 30 min early? I told her we would be there at 7, and I did not want to call ahead. She said that would be fine. I was happy that I found a place to eat on a Saturday night with such a large party and at 6:30 we all loaded up and drove down to Carlsbad. When I got there the hostess informed me that because I did not call 30 min early, we would have to wait 30 min. As I stood there holding my 5 wk old baby's car seat, I could feel my wife's family's anger. ""Why didn't we just go to Pacific 333 if we were going to have to wait?"" Finally, they all insisted that I go speak with the manager.  As I started speaking with the hostess and manager I noticed that my reservation was in fact noted.... on a napkin! The manager told me it would be less than 5 minutes and we would have the next table. And we did.  Overall, the food was decent and the beer was good. The manager handled the situation well. I know they were busy and we were a difficult goup to handle, but I just have such an angry feeling towards the whole situation that 2 stars is all I can give.

558,Edward H.,"San Diego, CA",25,59,6.0,1.0,2013-01-20,"This review is primarily for customer service and not for the food.  Following a movie outing in Oceanside, we decided to call in to BJ's to order a medium pizza.  Bear in mind, this is a Sunday evening after 10pm.  Since they're open til midnight, it was one of the few places still open serving relatively good food.  My wife called the take out number, the hostess answered and put us on hold.  While this is going on, take into account that we're driving from Oceanside to Carlsbad...  End result: We drove all the way from Mission Road, Oceanside to BJ's on Paseo Del Norte and NO ONE picked up the phone to take our order.  We were left on hold for 5-10 minutes.  Poor customer service. As we walk in, we're finally greeted by an employee and we explain our situation that we were put on hold and no one ever picked up.  No apology.  This individual went ahead and took our order (Ryan - from the receipt).  While waiting for our order (10-12 minutes), I noticed the restaurant wasn't busy, so I found it odd for the lack of attention.  Also during our wait, someone called the take out line and the hostess answered again, putting whomever on hold.  The same individual (Ryan) picked up the phone and based on what I could hear (i.e. loud enough for anyone to hear), it was a personal call.  So if someone else had been trying to place an order, would they have gotten through?  Made me wonder if this was why we were on hold for so long.  Extremely poor customer service.  Don't think I'll bother calling in an order here....as my wife mentioned she had to wait an extremely long time in the past also.  It might be better to drive up a bit and give Bistro West or Hensley's our business....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=600,3.56,3.53,3.53,2.02,3.5420000000000003

560,Mary H.,"Oceanside, CA",1,28,,1.0,2013-01-26,"After reading some of these reviews, I have to think if we are talking about the same restaurant. I know that sometimes it is just a bad day etc. and sometimes it should be brought up with management so they can make it right that same day. So with that being said I was just there today sat 1/23/13. So maybe management will address what they can if they see this and they should. My husband will not let me send any food back and hates if I complain.  We started out there today early got there around 11:45 am and it was not busy and got seated right away. Our server was ok, I ordered a glass of chardonnay and got interrupted by my granddaughter and forgot to mention was type. Server brought me the Barefoot house wine and I sent it back, I told him in a nice way it is always better to ask than to assume and of course to up sell :) He was nice about it and we joked that I may have looked like a Barefoot wine girl, but I like Kendall Jackson.   Anyways on to the food....the reason why we are there right???? Our food was so bad that my husband finally admitted it when we got home later today and we will never, ever go back.  I got sick from my food and missed most of Disney on Ice and my husband also got tummy ache, but not as bad as mine if you know what I mean.  I had a quarter of his burger and it was cold and just not good. It tasted like they did not clean the grill in a while and was kind of a rancid taste, which in my opinion what caused the stomach issues.  We also ordered the avocado rolls and they were also cold and just not good, no flavor!!!! French fries were also cold and horrible skinny tasteless things.  The manager of this restaurants needs to address the old food on the grill issue because that is the same as leaving food out and that is what causes food borne illnesses.  The kitchen staff should be talked to and opening management needs to check on this and make sure they don't have a case of the lazy's and getting people sick.   This may seem harsh and one should not rush to judge, but I have worked in restaurants long enough to know that if the entire order is cold and two people get sick then there is probably more people having the same issue with this establishment and management needs to address this right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=620,3.32,3.45,3.45,2.18,3.398

There were tons of empty tables and lots of servers walking around but the 3 hostess said it would be like 15-20 minute wait. We saw there was 1 table sitting outside and we asked if we could sit down out there any faster and they said no. So we literally waited 20 minutes to sit down and watch the hostess gossip among each other than try to seat people.  Once we sat down we waited around for a really long time. I understand if there isn't servers available but when you see a large group of them standing around computers and not working their tables that can be a little frustrating.

This review has nothing to do with food or anything but it does have to do with the LOUSY HOSTESSES who answered the phone when I called in and even when we arrived. I'm hoping a hostess gets re-trained so that Bj's doesn't have to suffer this type of ""bad representation."" I called ahead because Bj's has a ""call ahead"" concept. I understand it's not fool proof and I get that but every Bj's HAS this & even promotes it with business cards at the front... including this bus. However, this particular Bj's....is a sham. or maybe it's just the misinformed hostess.   When I called....the silly hostess told me they didn't do ""Call Ahead"" at this time because they were too busy, the wait was an hour..It defeats the purpose of promoting ""calling ahead"" when you don't accept it at certain times.. I don't know why this irritated me but maybe it's because it just didn't make sense. I go to my local Bj's (in another area) almost 1-2 times per month, never have they refused call ahead. Ok, next mistake.. I asked about the 2 for $20 deal. Bj's glorious deal that makes me love them that much more when they come back with this offer every few months. She said they don't offer this either at this particular location. Even after I asked her ""are you sure about that because I saw it on the website.."" she quickly reassured me (without even confirming with anyone around her or a manager) that they don't do that at this particular Bj's.  If your nation-wide website says you have something & you ""supposedly don't"" then you're probably not up to the Bj's standard. =( Anyways, we arrive, put our names down and given a 20 minute wait time..(I wonder if this is still ""too busy"" for call ahead... ) Then their system crashes and they go around with pen & paper to make another waiting list. Accidents happen and working in the service industry myself I understand that technology sucks sometimes... However,  there are 3-4 hostesses, it took them a while to get their act together, no sign of management....and they finally seat us 45 minutes later. Even after all this, they didn't apologize once to us... Our waiter quickly rectified all mistakes aforementioned by saying that the deal was still on til the 29th and he was VERY CONFUSED as to why we were told otherwise. He went to the hostesses desk and actually ASKED them if they knew that we were doing this deal.

Fish & chips I had were good; the fish pieces were of a good size and the skinny fries were done just right.  Wife had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon which looked nice, but tasted rather plain, despite the 9 spices it's supposed to be flavored with. Usually when we drive by, this place seems to be really busy but on at 1pm on a Friday, there was only a 2 minute wait which is fine by me.   Menu here seems to have pretty much something for everyone.   4 stars because while the food I had this time and the black and bleu burger I had last time were good, it's not good enough to be great.   Still worth coming back for though, especially since I see they have deep dish pizza here and short of going to San Diego for it, deep dish is hard to come by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=380,2.56,3.26,3.26,2.768,2.9800000000000004

I was so excited when they built one close to me here in Carlsbad. Normally, I never take the time to write a negative review. However, I have received VERY poor service the last two times I've been here and have not felt appreciated by management whatsoever when I've raised my concerns. I went here this past week to celebrate a friend's birthday and it took over 3 hours for us to receive our dinners. There was 6 of us, so not a huge group to accommodate. The drinks appetizers were brought out at different times (one by one it seemed). Half of the dinner orders were taken and the waiter did not come back for another half hour to take the rest of our orders.  The worst part of this experience was by far the treatment we received from the manager. Her attitude made us feel very unappreciated and the best she could offer us was to comp the cheapest item on every check (which came out to taking about 5 dollars off of our $40 bill). I believe some reevaluating of the management staff needs to take place at this location.

My group of 7 adults + 1 baby waited about 15 minutes. Since we were all hungry, we perused the menu while waiting so we could order right away. Once seated, we started with calamari. Once we were done, the plates were cleared and it felt like we were forgotten about for awhile because it took forever to get our entrees. I went with a new dish, the Moroccan spiced salmon, and it was just ok. It smelled great, but I was disappointed by the portion size. For the price, I expected more food. Also, I had no spoon, but the dish was soupy because there was so much sauce, so it was hard to pick up the couscous. My bf went with the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tastiest thing I tried all night. They had good spices and even had a bit of a kick. The noodles were bland.

That drink is normally $10 no more than that, so I went ahead to choose a different drink that wouldnt cost more than their expensive pasta dish.

Only had to wait a short amount of time to be seated. We asked for first available and was seated on the patio. Our waiter was busy so another waiter came by to take our drink and appetizer order. He returned with out drinks and checked back a few minutes later to ask if our waiter had come by to take our order. He hadn't, so this waiter took our order. A few minutes later our real waiter came by to check on us. We had already got our salad and drinks. I really liked that they worked as a team to get out order going so we didn't have to wait as long to order and to get our food.  We ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad to start. It was good but I prefer the one at Cheesecake Factory better. This salad was mainly lettuce with small amounts of tomatoes, black beans, chicken, and topped with onion rings. The BBQ sauce was very sparse and the ranch was very light.  The salad wasn't very saucy in sections, kind of dry.  For our main dish we ordered the Deep Dish Sweet Pig.  It was delicious!  The dough was  very thick and crunchy. Great flavors. Tons of ham and pineapples.  Dessert we shared the Pizookie Trio. So sad that we could not get the Peanut butter s'mores with the trio, so we had to choose another flavor. We went with the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Triple Chocolate, and the Salted Caramel. The triple chocolate was by far my favorite.  I'm pretty sure they gave us a regular peanut butter instead of the salted caramel. It tasted peanut buttery and had no caramel.  The white chocolate macadamia nut is very sweet, especially compared to the Triple chocolate.  Overall, service was good except for our dessert mistake. I can't wait to come back and try the new s'mores pizookie.  I would have given them a 4 star except they made mistake on our dessert which was a bummer since we were excited to try the salted caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180,2.92,3.09,3.216,3.1480000000000006,3.022

And the Pizzoki (probably not spelling it right) are fantastic.  They are basically a cookie, freshly baked in it's own little pan, with ice cream on top.  You can get one large one, or a sampler of 3 different ones.  (What most people don't know is you can also request just 1 of the small ones, which is usually enough to give you a taste of dessert, but not too much!) For those who are beer drinkers, there are a huge assortment of beers available, and their bar there is really attractive, with the bottles arranged beautifully and backlit. All in all, I think BJ's does a good job for a ""chain"" restaurant, and enjoy the smaller and low cal dishes offered there.

Our beer pitchers that we ordered got mixed up and the food that came to our table wasn't even mine. But I ate it anyways not realizing.  My food was good but everyone else said their food was eh. The ribs were subpar and not worth $22 and the steak was dry.  On top of that we kept getting food delivered to our table that we didn't order. I understand it happening one or two times but it happened 5+ times. No idea they could have that big of a mix up but they did.  Overall the food is eh. Not worth the price! At. All.

Congratulations that Hooters kicked your butt today for politeness,  timeliness,  efficiency,  the list goes on. Not only did bartender Johnny confirm that swapping pasta for brown rice was okay, he said a half & half (lunch dish w/salad) would be cool (smaller portion of chicken lunch & small version of a wedge salad). Okay: DONE, or so I thought.  After awaiting any attention to sampling two beers--he pitches immediately upon my sitting,  I thought, ""hey, it's Veteran's Day--kinda busy"" to myself. Whatever. After multiple delays and just being flat up ignored (the 2nd beer taster, my box later)...I was just over it. 'Peista resistance': the fact that I was not only charged for my FREE lunch (yes, I flashed my ID right away), I'd been UP-CHARGED. Seriously?  Because it's not uncomfortable enough to have to mention he screwed up, he charges me MORE?  I alerted him to this faux pas, and he makes me wait (again) a really long time & takes other orders,  and more while I'm waiting for the remedy. Okay, now you're just being a jerk & I'm seething at this treatment ON VETERANS DAY. After attempting to flag him down for a (leftover) box,  I gave up & asked the other bartender.  I hated to bug him, he had other folks to attend to, yet didn't have much choice. As it was, I had to remind him too. But at least he brought it.  By now, Johnny STILL had not come over to explain that had he adjusted the bill.  Idk, I'm thinking 15 minutes after pulling 'that',  you're just not great service staff.  I decided there's no way I can't tell a manager. I write a note on my bill (that this guy took no time whatsoever in sticking in a rock glass in front of me) stating a GM should call me ASAP bcs they're getting Yelped. Did I mention the two young,  male GIs next to me had proper bills & didn't have to ask for correction?  Yeah. And the interesting fellow drawing Batman on his digital tablet next to me--Johnny had time to look at his other drawings to where the guy offered him, ""wanna see my son?"" Lordy. Helloooo, customers waiting--aisle five. And this bartender also explained to someone who queried why it was so busy, ""it's the free meals for veterans"". Wow, jackaxx: a) you're welcome, b) sorry WE have inconvenienced you. Manager Anthony followed me out to see what happened. I told him the whole situ & how I   $$ in the rock glass & asked if he approach me based on the note passed to a waitress. I let Anthony know that if my note didn't surface,  they have a 'bigger issue'.  Anthony was great, and most the staff was on their game, yet this isn't the kind of thing you can 'gift card' away.

Last night was the last straw. I ordered curbside to go.. And ordered online. After I realized I punched in the wrong date to order, I called. An employee picked up the phone and said they'll cancel in and order when I'm ready and hung up. besides the fact that the person hung up, I ordered again. Now with the right date. I drove to the restaurant, a man comes out. Sounds like the same guy on the phone- and asks for the name.. Goes back in and pulls out receipts- and says that they have nothing made for me since the orders ""merged"" He sounds like the same guy on the phone.. He seemed really apologetic, and informed us he's the manager. He asked us to wait 10-15 minutes. Which we agreed to since we already drove there and were hungry. Needless to say I was very forgiving,  and polite. He threw a burnt pazookie In for free. I was thankful for that since I ordered one and it was free. I didn't know the pazookie was burned and charred. I didn't know that the burger we ordered is the wrong one and screwed up the side on it too, how can you get it wrong when you have two identical order at your hands?

188,Joe S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,2.0,2015-07-25,"I really wanted to like BJ's.  Having just moved to Carlsbad, my wife and I have been trying to find a casual place with good food and drink and a friendly atmosphere for our two young kids.   The atmosphere is nice.  We have no complaints with this or the service.  Even though the number one complaint with this restaurant seems to be the service, we haven't experience anything resembling poor service.  My biggest gripe is with the food.   I'm a big salad guy.   I know it's not very manly and I do eat red meat from time to time.  I usually seek out an ahi tuna salad if I can find one.  BJ's has this along with a few other good looking salads (at least from the menu perspective).  I ordered the ahi salad for myself and my wife hoping for the best.  What came out of the kitchen was one of the biggest abominations for an ahi tuna salad I have ever seen.  Where do I start.   The greens: browning on the edges, drenched in dressing that seemed to be applied at least an hour or two ago.  The tuna: you simply cannot cut slices of tuna hours ahead of time and expect them to stay fresh.  The tuna had already started to oxidize and turn brown.  Nothing close to the nice red color you usually see at good restaurants. The avocado: overripe and oxidized brown just like the rest of the ingredients.   I was hoping this was an anomaly.  The salads had obviously been prepared some time ago and stashed in a fridge.  You could tell because all ingredients (including the bowl) were all at the same temperature.  Kinda like when you order a salad from McDonalds.   The rare tuna should be served closer to room temperature than the salad for best flavor.    After expressing our concern to the waiter, he apologized and brought out two new ahi salads.   Prior to bringing out the salads, I politely asked the waiter to have the kitchen make two fresh salads instead of bringing us soggy salads from the fridge.   To our horror the new salads looked the same, if not worse than the previous!  Unbelievable!  I've come to the conclusion that BJ's likes to cut big corners by preparing dishes ahead of time and simply reheating or pulling dishes out of the fridge.  Items are not being made to order.  Another small nit picky item is with the soup we ordered.  I asked the waiter to have the soup brought out with the entree salads.  Not 2 minutes after we order, the soup is brought to our table.  I tell the waiter that the soup will be stone cold by the time our salads comes out.  He takes the soup back and brings it out with the entrees. Here's the kicker.  The soup is cold!  Like they left it in the kitchen while the salads were prepared!  Better tomato soup can be had at Panera.  At least they will bring it to you piping hot :) Long story short, we left hungry having not eaten dinner.  At least we didn't have to pay for the gross salads. We won't be going back...which is a shame.  I wanted to like BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=200,3.32,3.44,3.196,2.6640000000000006,3.3920000000000003

269,Brittny K.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",1,31,17.0,1.0,2015-08-24,"By far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had!! I called and made a reservation for 8:30 last night, the lady said she would do a courtesy reservation for us this one time, which I appreciated. It was a little busy when we first got there, which meant waiting 15 minutes past our reservation time. Our server Dave was very personable and friendly. I told him that I had the mobile app, and we would be ordering on the app so we could get 20% off our check. We ordered our food right away, which was calamari for our appetizer a large shark pizza and a full rack of ribs with a side of clam chowder and a baked potato. After ordering we asked Dave to bring us some bread for our grandma.  15 minutes later, he came back and asked for my BJ rewards number because our order wasn't showing in their system. He leaves with my number and comes back and asks for my phone to scan the barcode, I give him my phone and remind him that we were still waiting on our bread. He comes back with my phone (no bread) and said it was too small to scan, so I gave him my sisters phone to use instead. This time, Scott, who is the general manager? comes with my sisters phone (again, no bread) and says there is an issue and my account number is showing invalid. (which I found puzzling considering I had received email confirmation for signing up, and email confirmation for the food order we had put in). He verbally took our order so we wouldn't have to wait any longer, and said he would get the issue fixed with my account, that way we would still receive our 20% off discount. Considering my step mom who is pregnant and my grandmother who is 82, waiting an hour to get something so simple resolved was annoying and a bit pathetic, so when our server finally came back, we gave him a hard time about still not receiving our bread, and jokingly (but seriously) said our food better be fresh since we had been waiting so long.  He finally comes back with 2 slices of bread and our calamari appetizer. I didn't try the bread, but the calamari wasn't crisp and fresh like I know calamari is supposed to be, however we were so hungry that we wolfed it down.  Finally he comes out with our pizza, ribs and baked potato and asked if he could grab anything else for us. We told him we were missing our clam chowder, so he apologized and went to go grab our soup. As he's in the back, my dad is looking at his ribs and notices something is missing. I'm serving the pizza to my family, and I notice that it's extremely soft. I take a bite of mine, and it's freaking raw and cold. The server comes out, and my dad asks him if he notices anything about his ribs, and the server said it looked burnt and was plated horribly. My dadagrees, but states there's still something else missing, and takes his knife and taps on the top of the rib and asks the server again if he notices what is missing, A little confused, my dad helps him out by pointing out that the meat on the bone is missing. LIterally, the $25 rack of ribs was all bone, no meat.  The server apologizes and goes to get his manager. (Mind you, the general manager never came back to give me status on my account). So LUIS the ""assistant manager"" comes out and rudely asks whats going on here. No, ""I'm sorry I heard there is an issue with your meal, how can I help solve the problem"". My dad explains to him the situation, points out the bones we received and the raw/cold pizza. The guy rudely starts making excuses for the restaurant and asked if we want another rack of ribs instead and another pizza. Frustrated, my dad told him that he was pissing him off because of the excuses he was making and the way he was talking to him. He interrupted my dad and told him not to cuss at him (sorry, I didn't catch the memo where pissed meant you were cussing at someone). My dad then asked for his title, and said he would prefer to speak to Scott, in which Luis offered to go get him. When my dad asked if he was still here, Luis said he had left already for the night (so he basically lied) My dad went on to say the chef should be fired and the guy again interrupted my dad calling him rude.  At this point, I am pissed at the way he's speaking to my father, so I tell Luis how extremely rude HE is being to my father, and how insincere he is over the sitatuation. I explained we had been there for over 90 minutes, and before I could get another word out, he starts interrupting me. I told him to not interrupt me, and what horrible customer service this was, and that we would not be coming back to their restaurant, and I will be in touch with the general manager in regards to his failed ""attempt"" to rectify the situation.  As we leave, my family is walking to the front, and the ""assistant manger"" cuts them off and walks infront without an ""excuse me"" or ""you go first"" or any sort of apology for the time wasted at the restaurant. To me, that was just past the point of disrespectful and blatantly rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180,3.08,3.35,3.144,2.5320000000000005,3.242

I'm not a deep dish pizza person but i do really enjoy the parmesan encrusted chicken here and the entree size is large enough to enjoy as a second meal.  Overall, all of the food here is good which is impressive which such a large selection.  The kitchen must be bustling! As implied by the name, BJ's also has a long beer list.  BJ's brews a wide variety of beer which are good but nothing that I crave.  They also have a full bar for those wanting a non-BJ's beer, cocktail or glass of wine. When this location first opened I found the service to be good but on recent visits its been dismal.  The worst service is if you sit on the patio because they seem to forget you are out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=60,3.04,3.31,3.168,2.9920000000000004,3.202

Our waitress comes to take our order for drinks, and at that time were ready to put in our food order too. I was still giving this place the benefit of the doubt with it being busy,  and  our waitress being overwhelmed with other tables. I ordered the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, my mother in law had a tortilla soup. A guy server came by to drop her soup off. He asked if she wanted lemon in her soup before she could say no he already started adding it in the bowl. He touched her food and took it out.  I've never seen something like this. It's not sanitary or professional in my opinion.  He then dropped her spoon down in a rude manner. Once the rest of the food came out I asked the waitress for some ranch. When I finally got it i was practically done with my food and didn't need it anymore. The burger itself was good nothing special, the fries weren't even hot. My drink wasn't refilled and she didn't come and check on us or apolozie or anything. At this point were ready to leave. Presented credit card faced up in the black book so she could see it,  5 minutes later it's picked up. Night times are not their specialty, last year was the last time we were here.

Hate giving out anything less than 3 stars, it's really gotta be a crap experience for me to not give at least three.  Went for lunch this Monday 10/12/15 around 12:45/1 pm with my parents. Was greeted by the hostess who was fine, got sat immediately- which is about THE ONLY perk of this lunch.  Our server was honestly, garbage. I used to serve; did it all through college. I say that only to serve the purpose that my harsh criticism does not come without weight and experience. He was hurried, rude, not knowledgeable of the menu, forgot things I had asked for and just generally seemed like he would've rather been anywhere else than at work. He didn't know anything about the beer selection, couldn't offer recommendations and rolled his eyes actually when my mom was ordering.  On top of the, ehm, ""stellar"" service, we got food that was beyond bland. Very unexciting. I don't know if it's because our amazing server decided to leave it under the warmer for 15 minutes or what but everything just tasted...stale. I got a half and half flat bread (California club and roasted vegetable goat cheese). The bread was lifeless. The ""goat cheese"" if you can call three tiny white balls literally the size of an eraser on my flatbread a goat cheese flatbread, then it totally lived up to its standards. It tasted like it had sat out for a week. My moms sandwich plate was loaded with shoe string fries that tasted old! Not salty, not warm, just gross. My dad was the only one who got anything worth while. The BJ's barbecue lunch platter which he enjoyed and it actually smelled like it had just been cooked so I'm sure that's why.

The sauce was a sweeter kind of BBQ sauce, it was good, but I think it would be better a little spicier. I could only finish half of it because I had a lot of fries on the side. The soda was pretty good, and after I finished it the waitress asked if I wanted to try one of the other flavors. I tried the black cherry soda, and it was much better than the vanilla one. The menu says they're made with real sugar and brewed by them, so I thought that was pretty cool. The service was good, but a bit slow because of the whole veterans day thing.

I added a dash of salt, but didn't mind because I rather it be under seasoned and not over seasoned and salty. Asked for medium rare and got medium, which is ok too. I always order more on the rare side because it can always get cooked more if too rare. Can't undo over cooked steak.  I highly recommend signing up for their rewards programs.

Honestly, I'd rate them a 4. I've had REAL deep dish in Chicago many times and in other places. This was very, very ""bready."" I had the pepperoni supreme. It was good, but the overload of bread/crust just stuffs you quickly. I'd argue that it's not made fresh on premises. So, they need to work on that. I would get something else next time.

I like variety and sometimes in the mood for different things, but more than not, when I find something I really really like, I go to that place specifically for that.  BJ's is my place for deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  However they do have an amazing baked ziti dish, that is super greasy, but so good (that's my 3 stars).  It has been the ONLY meal that comes out hot and seems somewhat fresh.  The pizza is always luke warm, but by the time it comes out (because with like 4 other couples in there, they must be slammed in the kitchen) I'm so hungry I just eat it, instead of making the family sit there and wait for my food to come out after they are already done.

157,Teresa R.,"Vista, CA",3,5,8.0,1.0,2016-05-18,"A friend and I decided to swing by this place last night for the 2 for $25 they advertised.  Came in waited about 10 minutes or so to be seated. The waitress who initially helped us, I was given the impression, was rushed and not too concerned for our table. She took our drink order as well as noted we were in for the 2/$25 deal and rushed off. It was a tad busy when we arrived, however, I've seen this place at peek traffic time before and had far better of an experience then. It had most definitely thinned out by the time our table was taken over by the second waiter.  We received our drinks (2 sodas and 2 waters) and our salads soon followed. At this time she introduced us to Chris whom would be taking over the table. He seemed pleasant at first but as the night wore on proved to be inattentive and scattered.  After our salads we waited a good 30 minutes for the main dish to arrive and when it did, it was a bit overcooked and cold. At this point we just didn't care as we were already hungry. The waiter checked in maybe once with us before he brought the check. Now, this deal comes with: 2 salads, a choice of pizza and a pizookie to share. If sodas were added they were advertised to be a charge of only $1 each... Clearing that up, when we received our check we had not received the dessert yet. Chris was informed of this, yet as the waiter taking over a table it is his responsibility to take care to know these facts before closing out the bill. He expressed to us he wasn't even aware of what we had ordered and left. It then took about another 20-25 minutes to get the dessert. We received the check again and realized we were overcharged for the sodas. We paid the bill as it was considering we had been there nearly 2 hours when it was meant to be a quick dining experience. This is more so a review of service. I would come to this location quite often and would hold various business meetings here as well. I was astounded by the lack of care of the staff. They seemed more concerned with carrying on personal conversations rather than attending to the customers whom are the reason they have a job in the first place. I am sorely disappointed with the conduct displayed within this organization and it has not only been displayed to me as of last night. I have been coming here for years but am now having serious doubts as to the direction this company is headed.

We called ahead a time and made a reservation for our party and arrived at 0830 on the dot and were seated at 0927, no service just sitting there waiting nothing else. So after the long wait tried to forget about the wait since it was for a celebration and I ordered the beer sampler, fried calamari and the chicken bacon ranch Pantai. The beer sampler was great had a good selection to choose from and honestly it was enough for the night for me so worth it. The calamari was decent but they forgot to add one of the dips and lemons. I only bring this up because someone else in our party also ordered it and got it perfect with everything I had to ask the waiter to get just the other dip. Once the chicken bacon ranch Pantai came I was excited to try it and was immediately defensive when I saw just the 2 pieces of it and no fries. Again someone else ordered it as well and got the order with their fries and when I asked the server if my fries were coming in a separate plate or something he lied saying they ran out and were making more, he delivered the other Pantai right after that statement. Poor poor service, the food is okay to say the least dried and with Ordinary flavor nothing special. The best thing is the beer which is great to enjoy with friends besides that I highly do not recommend this place. Not trying to rag on this place for petty things but honestly when everyone else but you get their orders with no issues and you repeatedly get yours screwed up it begins to dawn on you and honestly make it seem your not an important or valued costumer.

150,Eric E.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,7,1.0,2.0,2016-06-08,"Super bummed to be leaving this review...  I want to make it clear that I have loved this restaurant for years and have been to a ton of locations.  This was my first time at this location and not a good experience for me.   Short version : We had unkind, poor service that took well over an hour to have just soup and salads for lunch. My experience: I was meeting up for a quick lunch with a friend and arrived first.  I told the hostess that there would be two of us for lunch and she kindly asked me to wait at the top of the stairs (I was expecting to be met by someone who would then take me to table).  I waited there for about ten minutes, when my friend arrived.  She asked if I'd requested a table and said yes, the hostess asked me to wait here.  A few more minutes went by and the hostess finally approached us and asked if we'd been helped.  I mentioned that she asked me to wait here. Off to our seats!  Finally (elapsed time ~13 minutes)...  It was a nice day so we sat on the patio.  We discussed possibly getting a pint of the newly advertised beer and chose our food.  We sat patiently as we awaited our waitress.  Our waitress came to take our drink orders (elapsed time ~20 mins).  We asked to try to the new beer and placed our food orders -- unlimited soup and salad lunch and a cobb salad.  She said most who have tried the new beer haven't liked it, but I am a big fan of BJs beers so I thought I'd give it a try. Our food, water, and beer samplers arrived (elapsed time ~45 mins, mind you we each have hour lunch breaks).  The beer was bad.  We didn't order any after the sampler.  The food was pretty good, as to be expected from many visits to other BJs locations.  Unfortunately, because it took so long to get our food, I was unable to enjoy the ""unlimited"" aspect of my order.  We requested our check and a to go box for the rest of my friend's Cobb salad.  We kindly mentioned we needed to get going because our lunch breaks were over (elapsed time ~55 mins). My friend's schedule was a bit more strict and she called into work to let them know she'd be late.  We both work within less than a mile from this location.  After about ten minutes, she went inside to ask for the check and box.  During this time, guests at a nearby table had gotten up and left, having waited a considerable length of time for service.  My friend returned and said that our waitress, of which we'd had several, was just inside chatting up the hostess.  A few minutes later she set the check on the table and walked away, as we both sat with cards in hand, expecting to just give her our cards. Our waitress returned and took our cards (elapsed time ~65 mins).  She came back in five minutes later asking if we wanted to split it down the middle.  This was the worst part, it took another five minutes for her to return.   Conclusion: As I mentioned from the start, I am super bummed to be sharing this experience.  Now, I understand that occasionally there are staffing issues.  Occasionally someone is having a bad day.  Therefore, I will definitely be giving this place another chance, especially since I have enjoyed other locations so many times.  I hope they earn my confidence back the next go around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=140,3.04,3.17,3.228,2.472,3.118

175,Chris G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2016-06-25,"You won't believe this but this is the honest truth.  Coming home from long day with kids at water park, my family and our friends took our kids for a late night (9pm) dinner and dessert here on Saturday. None of us had ever had any negative experiences here before but tonight was all-time.  There was a 30 min wait...at 9pm!  So we snatched a big booth in the bar area.   As the busser finished cleaning and wiping down table for us I noticed what I thought to be a piece of lettuce on the floor under the table. I used my shoe to brush it to the front so that the bus boy would clean it up.  To everyone's HORROR it was a used CONDOM. How does that get there??!!!  To be honest I can't believe that I must tell you that we stayed to eat after that.  We called the manager over and while he cleaned it up with broom and he apologized, he actually did not seem overly apologetic nor did he offer/comp us anything.   If I was in his shoes I would be absolutely mortified!  We never saw him again that night.   Rest of the night: Service was very slow but we were in the quasi bar/lounge area so I could understand that a bit.  Food was average at best.  Ordered a small deep dish bbq chicken pizza. It was warm at best and not that tasty. Mostly bread With very little bbq sauce or cheese .   I ordered a beer but I had to remind the waiter 5 min later that he had not brought it to me...and we were in the bar!!! Both families ordered a pizookie dessert.  It is a cookie warmed up with 3 scoops ice cream. Our ice cream was nearly fully melted by time it arrived. It was ok but way too sugary for my taste.  My daughters clam chowder bread bowl was good.  I still cannot believe that nothing more was done for us regarding the used condom. We hoped that the table before us played a joke but the reality is likely that employees got it on after hours the night before.  #Classy! I had to come back to edit after I read a few recent reviews. After 1 review from 2 weeks ago mentioned how dirty the place was the GM replied on Yelp by saying he was sorry that their ""usual gold standard"" wasn't experienced.  Wow!  I've never seen dirty used condoms in a booth before!  Is that the gold standard??  Cmon man.

So the 4 top all had drinks while we had not even seen a server. At the end it flipped flopped, we got our checks while the four top had not seen there server since their food was dropped off. They also forgot two burgers, everyone was eating and I noticed they didn't say anything about how long do I asked. She hadn't even noticed she didn't bring them. Apparently they were given to another table. They got their burgers while everyone else was done eating. In general we spent too much time just waiting for service. We would have to flag random servers for assistance. Restaurant wasn't even that busy and they couldn't of been that short if servers had time to chat it up with the host. I don't know what happened, I don't know if the host messed up communication or what but regardless the servers were not on top of their tables.

I mean, I've come here often enough, typically out of indifference to someone else's choice.  As far as chain restaurants go, you could do much worse.  Everything I've eaten here has been average or a little above.  Most appetizers are precooked, frozen, heated to a hint over warm, and served with bottled sauces.  Food is salty and sweet, not much spice or acid to help cut through any of the grease.  But all pizzas are still a step or so better than you would get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, the burgers and chicken on par with your local Chili's. All of this together may sound like the makings of a three or even three and a half star review, and I would leave it there if not for one thing ... those damned Pazookies. Moist, gooey, sugary sweet, laden with cold and melting ice cream, and served in a variety of flavors that seem to cycle with current tastes.  Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, good ole' Chocolate Chip or Peanut Butter, these things are basically half baked cookies with a couple scoops of something on top and there's no leaving BJ's without getting one.  Typically the outer edges are burned, difficult to get out of the pan without forceful scraping, and when you do your spoon gains that tangy aluminum taste that makes your face sour up.  The rest of that Pazookie, though ... damn. Honestly, BJ's is probably best around happy hour, a drink or two, maybe an appetizer, and a tableful of Pazzokies while you laugh with friends and keep clicking on nearby PokeStops.  Do dinner if you have to, but don't leave without that hot cookie and ice cream and you can go away with a bit of a smile and a fairly happy stomach thinking this place is the weak four star place that it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=20,2.92,3.1,3.228,3.056,3.0280000000000005

173,L V.,"Vista, CA",1,15,2.0,2.0,2016-09-30,"This was unfortunately a very poor experience and the only reason they get two stars tonight is because the food actually does taste decent as far as restaurant chains go.  We had two kids 6 and under with us and were told 15-20 minutes for a table; this was a HORRIBLE gauge of time because the restaurant was packed. We waited an hour. 30 mins into the wait my sister went up to check on our position on the wait list and ALL THREE hostesses ignored her for five minutes before acknowledging her presence at the hostess booth, which was literally one foot away from their persons.  When we FINALLY were taken to our table an hour after arrival, one of the very very tall waiters was walking through our party to cut us off and get to a table as we walked to ours, almost kicking one of our kids because he wasn't even professional enough to wait for us to pass. RUDE.  We asked for drinks while the person who seated us blindly recited the drink menu and ignored our request before telling us our waiter would be by to serve us, and then walked off. When our waiter came 15 mins after being seated, to our chagrin, it was the really really tall waiter who almost ran one of our kids over. He didn't smile; he barely seemed pleasant. We hurriedly gave him our drink order, kids food order, and our appetizer order so we could take time to discuss entree options and whether we wanted to eat there or not. We waited another 15-20 mins and I finally had to flag someone down just so we could get our drinks. It took another five minutes before he returned with the drinks (along with six other tables drinks), and by that time our kids were falling asleep, no food for them had been served yet. It was Mac n cheese and a mini pizza. This isn't a delicacy requiring more than 10-15 min of cook time and plating.  We decided we were not going to order food, no one seemed to care, our waiter barely cared that we voiced concerns over wait time for meals, which was why we were holding off on getting food for ourselves.  When our food finally came, it was two small mushroom appetizers that were lukewarm, which meant it had been sitting out waiting to be served for a while. It was good but disappointing to find it wasn't hot and fresh.  We ordered via app Chilis to Go while we waited for our check.  Terrible service tonight, we've eaten at this location many many many times and spent hundreds of dollars, it's sad to see that as of late the quality has been unimpressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=160,3.24,3.12,3.236,2.8560000000000003,3.1680000000000006

Usually it's a week night dinner or a lunch on a weekend afternoon. We ALWAYS sit in the bar. First come first served seating. They even have booths available. The menu is huge, just like a cheesecake factory, so be prepared to be overwhelmed there. I always used to get giant baked potatoes but sadly that is no longer part of the menu. The most recent occasion they were advertising a $10 off of $35 food order. We over ordered a bit so we could make that threshold and bring some food home. We weren't drinking their delicious beers this time and had an iced tea and diet coke instead. The waitress was quick to bring a refill sometimes even before we had finished the first. Which was really nice. We ordered a mini deep dish pizza to share with the works. They were 1/2 off during happy hour. This was REALLY good. Way better than I expected. My husband ordered something new off their menu, a peanut soba noodle bowl. What was so nice is it came out with fresh veggies, big green pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots.

124,Dan R.,"San Diego, CA",78,17,,1.0,2016-12-11,"I went there yesterday with my fiance and future mother-in-law. We ordered some beers a flatbread, deep dish pizza and a salad. The side salad was perfectly acceptable however when the pizza came out it went downhill. The deep dish pizza was lukewarm at best and if you rang it out im pretty sure you would wind up with a gallon of oil. Pizza regardless of type does not need to be prepared this way. The flatbread came out cold. When my mother in law asked the waitress to fix it, she brought it back, heated it up for a few seconds and it was back on the table. Now I am well aware that with chain restaurants like this, heating up frozen food, as this flatbread clearly was is common practice. However I do not want to have the food taste like it was frozen. It was rubbery, impossible to cut and tasted horrible. Then the waitress brought us the check. As we were putting in our credit cards she rushed back out saying she had forgotten to add two five oz tasters to the check. I get mistakes and have no qualms paying an extra five bucks but on principle if you make a mistake at a restaurant then you should own it considering the horrible food and novice service.

123,Mikayla G.,"Oceanside, CA",4,24,22.0,1.0,2017-01-13,"I am really disappointed with my last 2 visits. Last Monday we came and got a trio pizookie to go but when we got our order the ice cream was on the hot cookie (so obviously melting), so when I brought it to the waiters attention they took it back. Instead of providing pizookies that hadn't been topped with ice cream all they did was take the ice cream off and put it in a to go container. Not a huge deal but it's frustrating. Then last Sunday, we ordered a medium BJ's classic without mushrooms. When it was delivered (not by our waiter) we noticed the mushrooms and asked that they be taken off. Our waiter then delivered it again, announcing no mushrooms. We started eating it and found that it still had mushrooms. Apparently it was taken back and the mushrooms were just picked off. So they only caught what they could see. When we complained, he offered to take it back and get a new pizza. The new one came out and he was apologetic and said we will ""take it off"" so when I got the bill, I was very surprised that what they were taking off was the pizza that they got wrong twice not the new one.

145,Beckve B.,"Temecula, CA",1,14,13.0,2.0,2017-01-13,"Overall the experience was so so. If you're coming strictly for the service I wouldn't hold your breath, if you're coming strictly for the food- it's not that great I would consider going somewhere else. I first started with a wait of about 40 minutes to get in, understandably as it is a Friday night. However, once we were finally seated it took too long to get appetizers and our meals. Our first appetizer came and was actually incorrect- we requested our boneless wings however we received wings with bone in which was not what we had requested. The meals themselves were okay. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon which was good but the snow peas had a very tarty almost sour sauce which actually hurt my stomache. The children ordered corn dogs, chicken strips, and mini burgers which they consumed without a problem so I'm assuming all was fine. However my husband ordered a shrimp jambalaya with chicken as a substitute and it was bland. The cook simply put a lot of spices on the plate rim itself so as not to put it in the food. We had to constantly ask our server or look for our server for things we needed such as ketchup, refills, napkins etc. We waited about 20 minutes after the meal was completed in order to be able to receive our check to go.

187,Baylee O.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,1.0,2.0,2017-01-14,"Tonight I ordered 2 pizzas using the online ordering service. The website seemed like they made it really easy to get what you want. I myself ordered the Mediterranean with the chicken and pepperoncinis on one side only. When we got there everything seemed to be running smooth but thankfully we checked the pizza before leaving. Chicken was on the whole thing which is not doable as I am a vegetarian. Our curbside attendant was polite and apologized and clarified what we wanted and went to go have it remade. Well the new one comes about 20 minutes later. Still wrong. This is a negative review towards the pizza chef and preps as it should not be this hard to make a $30 pizza right with one try let alone two. While I was extremely disappointed with the chefs, Dalton who helped us did an amazing job. He had a great personality, was funny, apologetic, and asked what he could do to make this right. Way to go Dalton! Horrible job from the chefs as the pizza was wrong and honestly not even good.

The rest of the food is ok, but the deep dish pizza is pretty darn tasty! The buffalo chicken pizza is one my favorites. Also if you sign up for the rewards card you get emails that give you some good rewards. Sometimes its a free pizookie and sometimes it a buy one entree and get one half off or free. Also they notify you about the beer and food pairings.  The beer and food pairings are pretty cool! I have been to a few of them over the past years and each one has been different.

The only good thing was plenty of parking spots.  Why the 2 stars? - on Sunday around 6 PM, the wait was over 25 minutes for a party of 2. They initially said 10-15 minutes but it took 25 minutes.  - overpriced food (most of the entrees were between $11-20); medium pizza for $21  - food was mediocre: our tomato bisque soup was not even warm and tasted like it came out of a can; our pizza was super greasy, had no tomato sauce, and had minimal toppings (we got only a few pieces of each topping); our salad only filled half of the plate. - lack of service: our server was clearly waiting too many tables; we had to flag him down for extra water, napkins, the check and a to-go box. he was nice but did not check in with us at all.  - love their pizookie but the size had not changed over the years but the price keeps going up! it's now $7-8 for one pizookie which can fed 1-2 people depending on how hungry you are at the end of your meal.

61,Ryan M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",158,27,4.0,1.0,2017-03-26,"The management at this place is a joke!!  I just moved back to San Diego from Hawaii.. Naturally, I'm searching for jobs. I had it pretty good in Hawaii, in terms of work. I owned and operated my own dive company. I have been very successful at selling myself throughout my life, in part due to the 18 years of sales and customer service experience I have obtained through hard work and an unparalleled work ethic instilled in me by my late father.  Last week I came across a job posting from the above company, it was 3 days old, and had several position attached to it. I applied for everything except the bar. With the 8 years of experience in the food industry I have done damn near everything in a restaurant except work the bar.  Immediately following completion of the online app I called the establishment and spoke to Jack. He informed me of what position were still available and asked me to come down and speak to Phong the following morning at 11am. I arrived 10 minute early, waited till they opened and was told right away that Phong wasn't working this day. So I spoke to the Kitchen manager, who didn't give his name and didn't really care to speak with me. He brushed me off and pretty much told me to come back another time.  First off.. my time is just as valuable as yours Mr. Kitchen Manager.. At this point I was discouraged, because I have never sat through a proper interview and not been offered a job. I wasn't about to just waste my morning by going home without talking to someone. So I asked to speak to the opening manager. Who is a complete tool by the way. His name was either Ruiz or Luis idk I didn't really care to record his name in my memory banks because I waited an hour for him to come and talk to me. He didn't come and talk to me out of professionalism that much is for sure. It was out of courtesy because I sat there as long as I did. This guy couldn't even tell me what positions were available.. he also said that he didn't think I had enough experience without even looking at my resume. I think he assumed I was some fresh 20 year old with no work experience (judging from the way he was talking to me) not a 32 year old who has been working since he was 15. Granted I look a lot younger then I am because I live a healthy life style. He made it seem working at BJ's is the peak of a career in the industry. I didn't even bother following up with these clowns. Before I left I took a look at some of the kids they have working there and chuckled because I know I can run circles around them. Rest assured the very next place I went to hired me on the spot. uhhh, because he looked at my resume!! I use to frequent BJ's in grossmont and always favored it as one of my favorite places to eat.

Arriving back at the hotel, I realized that we were also missing the toppings for our baked potatoes that we had paid for.  The food was okay. Steak was good and cooked correctly. Baked potatoes were dry without the toppings. Tomato mozzarella salad was bland and tomatoes under ripe.  I did feel sympathy for the guy behind the counter that assisted to be training the young woman.

8,Monica T.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,135,231.0,1.0,2017-07-24,"I was very disappointed at my visit here. I figured there was no way BJ's, a huge and reputable food chain could ever have such a low rating; that was until my visit last night.  We arrived and we're seating right away. I should have read the signs the universe gave me when we arrived. The hostess with an overloaded amount of make up took our names. This was followed by another young lady who seated us. I said we had 5 in our party, and we were seated at a table for 4. We told the hostess she was missing a chair, so she sent us back to wait until the tables were reconfigured to accommodate our party.  We were finally seated and our server asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for water and beer. The first round of drinks were correct, however the server did not notice when our drinks were empty and needed refills. When ordering a refill of a beer, the server brought the incorrect drink. We had to walk up to the bar to exchange our beers for the correct ones. We waited before doing so however our server was no where to be found.  We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Unfortunately the breading was missing on a few pieces and the breaded ones tasted like the calamari was fried in recycled oil. When we received our appetizer, we had to ask the hostess for utensils because we were never given any when seated.  My son ordered a steak. He told the waiter he wanted medium rare, I told the waiter no, medium. My son received well done. The waiters response ""you told me medium well"". We asked for a new steak because it was certainly over cooked. That was the first time we realized we may have been irritating our waiter. My son also ordered a side of macaroni and couscous, and a second side of just couscous. When his food arrived, it was both the same macaroni and couscous. The macaroni and couscous tasted like soggy left over couscous thrown into macaroni. The cheese tasted like the nacho cheese you eat with nachos at a baseball game. The kicker- the credit card fiasco. We were ready for our bill and the server said he would be back with our (separate) checks. We waited and waited, and tried to flag down someone. I felt bad we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours, waiting for a majority of the time. I never like being ""those people"" who sit and hold up a table, however there was no one waiting for a table and there were plenty of empty ones.  We finally received our bill, and gave the waiter our credit card. When he returned with the receipts and cards, the bill changed to our card was incorrect. We noticed another guy flagging down the same waiting with the same problem; our credit cards and charges were mixed up. There goes another 20 minutes trying to find our waiter to settle our credit card Fiasco.  There is no way I would ever return to BJs. The server seemed annoyed with us correcting him and I felt bad at first but then I think about how much attention he really gave us. We had dirty plates from appetizers on our table, and we had to request our plates get taken away. It's one thing to mess up once and be sincere about it, it's another to make patrons feel like we are bothersome to you.

43,Aria S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",46,5,,5.0,2017-08-06,"I haven't been to a BJ's in years because I'm allergic to gluten. We were looking for a decent dinner that the kids would enjoy, too, after Legoland.  And it came up first on Yelp.  They told us a 45-minute wait to seat a group of 9, and the kids were starting to squirm.  The GM recognized our kids and my husband from the neighborhood (nice surprise) and bumped us up in the queue, so we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Very cool! Our server was a trainee and she did really well.  She was funny and made us feel at home.   Good food does take a while to come out, and the kids were starting to melt down after the long day.  When it did come out, everything was hot and delicious.  My sister and mom ordered wedge salads that were just the right size for starters.  I ordered a gluten free pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. It was good for gluten free.  GF crust is usually cardboard, but it was soft and chewy.  My son got the kids deep dish cheese pizza, no tomatoes (thanks to the servers for warning us that all pizzas come with chopped tomatoes - he would not have liked that).  My daughter ordered the kids sliders with salad.  My husband ordered the hickory brisket barbecue burger, which he really liked.  The GM also hooked us up on the bill, which was much appreciated after a day at Legoland.  Thank you!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=40,2.48,3.08,3.104,3.3800000000000003,2.8400000000000003

I also came into contact with a new employee named Connor who was a busser if I remember correctly!

7,Johnny C.,"Central West End, Saint Louis, MO",0,26,40.0,5.0,2017-12-31,This a must go when visiting Carlsbad outside San Diego. Their BBQ IS TASTY! The menu is packed with so many amazing appetizers and dishes. Best of all they are a brew house with beers for all taste buds. Today I am having a Black Velvet...with BBQ ribs on the way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2,3.4,3.16,3.152,,3.2560000000000007
24,Lindsey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,10,,5.0,2018-01-05,"This review is for the brussels sprouts only. They are TO DIE FOR. We go to BJ's for this dish only, so I can't speak for the rest of their food but their brussels are seriously out of this world. So crunchy and crispy, and the honey sriracha sauce is perfectly balanced. We always ask for extra sauce! According to their nutrition facts they're actually not that caloric, but I am very suspicious. I don't think there's any way to achieve that delicious crispy texture without deep frying. But they're worth it. Make sure to get 2 orders if you're dining with more than one other person! They go quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=20,3.56,3.16,3.156,,3.3200000000000007
6,Taylor S.,"San Diego, CA",239,5,1.0,5.0,2018-01-06,I was super happy with everything tonight! We had two very very excellent waitresses! I asked for suggestions on the menu and got great ideas. I even asked one of the bus boys and he gave me details of what he likes. I got the deep dish five meat small pizza. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food but I'm stuffed. They brought out great birthday pazookies. Great service and good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2,3.6,3.17,3.16,,3.342
0,Krysten S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",279,67,78.0,4.0,2018-01-07,"Came here for an easy dinner/get together with a few friends on NYE before we hit the bars. It was pretty busy with young people who probably had the same idea. The server was really nice and attentive but you could tell he was a little stressed out with how busy the place was.  Drinks were okay, not super strong but not weak, it is a family friendly place after. I tried a Paloma which was refreshing just super sweet. Food wise, everything came out relatively hot and altogether. We had the Parmesan chicken with lemon thyme sauce, chicken fettuccine, salmon, spinach artichoke dip, sriracha Brussel sprouts, queso and fries. Everything was pretty good, just kind of normal food, nothing special you know? The chicken was crispy but needed more sauce, the pasta was pasta, it's hard to mess up. The salmon was very good with the asparagus and the apps were just kind of meh. It's the same experience you'd get at any chain place. However, the atmosphere, the friends and the service coupled with easily good food made this 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2,3.64,3.16,3.156,,3.3520000000000008
