I've never had a ""great"" meal, but that's not really what you're paying for or should expect.  Everything is pretty ordinary, salads and appetizers are alright, entrees are alright. Service and environment is good typically, and they have some really good beers and good specialty items. Their draft root beer is amazing, and I would end every meal with a BJs pazookie if doing so meant I wouldn't drop dead from heart failure at 35. I like their burgers pretty well, but they took their classic burger off the menu, which was a bummer. It was really good, so that's too bad.  It's a good place to watch a game or to grab a bite if you're in Chandler, but it's never going to wow you.

286,Julie S.,"Tempe, AZ",3,26,,1.0,2012-02-26,"I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much. First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience.  We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope.  First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down. To make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.   I spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=240,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.0120000000000005,3.84

I'm not really sure exactly what benefits a  title like ""Duke Of BJ's"" would get you.  Perhaps it might get you out of a speeding  ticket or get you backstage at a classic rock  dinosaur reunion show but you might end up having to ""prove"" your credentials. So anyway this place is never my first choice but it gets voted in our rotation so I'm a regular  here. The lunch special tacos are light and make for a decent lunch. The miso salmon is also good although a bit pricey. And I must say the Chicken Parmigiana is also quite  doable. Came here once for a happy hour and appetizers were meh. Also, you never know what level of service you'll get.

We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery, but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here.  We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions. I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus.  It came with white horseradish and was delicious!  My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad, and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries.  OMG food was so good! Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked, and everyone here was happy.  I would love to come here and drink, as they have an awesome drink menu, but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom, I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here! I will say, the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside!

The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture.

210,Mizz jazzi ladi L.,"Chandler, AZ",12,13,2.0,5.0,2012-07-21,"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant..... This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw ""Brave"" Great Movie)  Anyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy....  The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip)  So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color.....  Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal.... Last but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about.....  Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=180,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.4440000000000004,3.6800000000000006

Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh?  Also, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh? All in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the ""Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad"" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious. No other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot).

It's actually on the mall property, so it's easy walking distance from the mall itself and the nearby Harkins theater. I recommend hitting them for happy hour between 3-7 weekdays and then taking in some shopping or a movie. The menu is rather extensive and most of the offerings are quite tasty. The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out, and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food.  Some of the beers really stand out, and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place.

There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to ""toss the wings in sauce"" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large. This place is a hit because of it's location and it's  atmosphere.

I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entrée. I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fiancé had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty, it had a combination of cheddar cheese, dill pickles, ground beef, bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fiancé's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty. We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm.....

It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision. There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one. I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here. Overall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back.

The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!   Ok, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....

They're not you-call-it-wells, they're you-call-it-anything, so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer, so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4. We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so ""happy"" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy. Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a ""deal"".

Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate. Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud.

I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does.  So, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen. OK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit. I started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased.  So where does this leave me?

I may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.

The food isn't terrible, but the service usually is. Just about EVERY time we order, one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing, we are over charged, the person taking the order doesn't have a clue what they have on their menu, it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the ""delivery charge"" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact, the last time we ordered, we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should've been included in our meals, (fries, salads, soups, etc.), the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here. The food was nasty, cold, rubbery and some things were missing. I don't know how the dine-in service and food is around lunchtime, but I can assure you that they need to do some serious adjustments to their take out/delivery!

The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our ""contraband"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers.

About 1 year ago, I was there and ordered an appetizer, salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new ""hot"" one. When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago, I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot.

86,Jeannie C.,"Phoenix, AZ",189,14,30.0,1.0,2015-05-06,"One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER.  1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more ""Cajuny"". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible.  2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeño burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns? 3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes?  Worst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta.

A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given.  Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more.

Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid's meals. C likes fruit so I said fine, add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes.

153,Coco K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,2015-09-09,"The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management.  My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM.  The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night, they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible.  When I inquired as to what had happened, the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system, the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM).  The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened.  His demeanor was less than encouraging, no apology was given, and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait.  There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error.  Looking around the restaurant, I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made.  Instead, he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes).   Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years, there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating, or at least somewhere to sit, offered some seating at the bar, maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children, or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat, vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least, a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals).  My true disappointment was not that a mistake had happened, but rather how the situation was poorly handled.  We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change, but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager, my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly, that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly, a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location, thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was.  I would suggest a bit more training for the staff, not just for the hostess stand employees, but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader.

13,Kat P.,"Mesa, AZ",68,188,377.0,3.0,2016-03-19,"BJ's Brewhouse Chandler is located at the mall. We met some friends here for dinner on their suggestion.  Being at the mall during spring break is not my idea of a good time, so there's that. Parking was a nightmare. Wait time was very short, and the restaurant itself was busy but not too loud.    was great. We started with calamari and salads. The calamari was very salty, but was cooked well, so as not to be rubbery. The Caesar salad was great.  Before the main course,  I ran out of water. Where's the server? Who knows. Eventually I see her and beg for some. The entrees arrive with perfect timing. Our friends order jumbalaya and the shrimp asparagus penne. I also chose the penne, and my husband the Mahi Mahi with shrimp on couscous. He really enjoyed his meal, as did I.  Then, I ran out of water. I steal my husband's. I run out of his water. I don't see the server until everyone is dine and she offers the dessert menu. I drink my water refill in one second flat. We're not quite ready for dessert, bit are chatting and randomly glancing at the menu. For all the mad - dogging and dessert preasure, you'd think that I could get a flippin' glass of water! We eventually order the Pizookie trio, sampling the macadamia nut,  Ghirardelli triple chocolate and the salted caramel. Holy chocolate balls these were good!   And then I ran out of water. She drops the check before the dessert comes. Some other dude brings dessert. She promptly collects the check and we never see her again. I have imbibed everyone's water. The server was nice enough, but seemed more intent on rushing us through, maybe to get off in time? I'm not a pain in the butt, and I've been a server, so I'm polite, not needy, and tip really well, so I don't think watching the beverages of your tables is too much to ask. And then...the restroom. Going into the restroom felt like a transporter into a bus station bathroom...in Mexico. It was beyond gross. One stall was locked but appeared empty. A staff member had locked herself in another and was on the phone professing her love to her man in Spanish. That left the hc stall. Feces covering the toilet seat, toilet paper everywhere like a bomb went off...just gross.  My husband said that the men's room was worse. He said that is was flooded from a toilet and also in severe disarray. While we enjoyed our food and company, we will not likely come back.

There is a continuous pressure on selling more even while you're still eating, yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses. I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here. On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us.  Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests.

You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests. They were too busy chatting with one another. Being in the customer service industry, I find this behavior and actions completely unacceptable. Those two, Bailey and Tyler, certainly make it easy to decide not to come back.

The food was good, not out of this world but good. To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger.

He was attentive during the meal. The pub/bar food is actually good, unlike some breweries that have great beer but only mediocre food. I had the double burger loaded with onions, cheese, a house made bun, and a side of onion strings.

We were seated and after we got our drinks, our server disappeared for a good 10 minutes before she showed up to take our order. The food... Oh man, my girlfriend ordered pasta(forgot the name), it was so undercooked and tasted like it was froze and microwaved. I wanted to return it back to the kitchen, but it was too much of a hassle to find the server since she disappeared again. I bought the bison burger, which was good. We tried the dessert and that was amazing.

She answered all my questions and asked in the kitchen to check that the bread bowl was vegan. They had a vegan option labeled on the menu, a lentil soup. They also had other plates that could be made vegan. I ordered guacamole and the soup. The appetizer came out quickly and was great. Our food came out really late and they mixed up my order but the manager came out and apologized and checked in with us. The food was really good, pretty filling. It's a good place to go for big groups and for a nice dinner. Everyone in our group found something they liked on the menu and everyone ended up happy with their meal.

This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate, not in the pan, and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio, and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter, (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again, but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times, and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead. On all three occasions we came it seemed like our servers were the only ones doing anything. The food runners and bus boys stood around gossiping and twiddling their thumbs.

The pizza is good which is why it gets three stars but when we went last night I just couldn't believe how long it took when she was not the only server working. You would think when you are serving so close to your managers or leads that you would be working better to show your strengths but this was terrible. She not once ever refilled my water even after asking and putting it out for her to see. She never once looked at how I never touched my Awful margarita and said hey I noticed you haven't touched your margarita is everything okay? Nope not once. My fiancé asked for a side of ranch and we definitely never got that either. I seriously couldn't believe how little this server cared. Definitely will not be back anytime soon.

22,Jacky C.,"Tucson, AZ",242,57,108.0,1.0,2017-10-16,"STAY AWAY! If you're debating between a few restaurants and this is one of your options, you can cross BJ's off your list and I'm sure you won't regret it.  My family took my bf here for his birthday.  We were seated immediately and the server came over in a timely manner. He had no knowledge of the menu- he kept offering items that were not even on the menu and then saying ""Oh sorry never mind you can't get that"".  The food was mediocre at best.. rib eye, mahi-mahi tacos, chicken sandwich were all overpriced and it seemed like the quality was not what it used to be- More bland than it was flavorful.  Anything we requested from our server, such as an extra ranch or drink refill, were forgotten about.  The server ID'd my bf when he ordered a beer and noted that it was his birthday the day before our visit, but forgot it when it was time for dessert and we had to remind him.  We ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The server informed us, to my bf's disappointment, that they were out of vanilla ice cream and will have to give us chocolate instead. My bf is not a fan of chocolate (what a weirdo, right) and passed on the pizookie but they brought out the cookie anyway. About 5-10 mins later, we see dessert plates being brought out with VANILLA ICE CREAM. I guess they restocked but we were not informed, received no apology and the server had made no effort to make things right.  To top off our amazing experience, my bf, my sister and I ended up in and out of the restroom all night from 2 in the morning til now thanks to the mahi-mahi tacos we decided to try. If I had to diagnose that, I'm going to guess that we've got food poisoning.  I called the manager on duty this morning to explain everything that had happened to her and she had no sympathy or desire to make things right.  Don't waste your time or your money! There are sooo many other options than a place that has no respect for your needs or your time. You. Deserve.

39,Shawna A.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,2017-11-30,"BJs was a place that my husband and I frequently would visit, mainly due to the late hours they have. We routinely pick up food from here and have given this restaurant multiple chances after they CONSTANTLY mess up our orders and finally, enough is enough, and I can't see a time when we're coming back. Back on Veternan's Day my husband and I picked up food to go; my order was severely messed up (missing toppings, wrong side), and I called the restaurant to let them know. The worker was apologetic and said we would get refunded; I gave our card number that it was purchased on and three weeks later, still no refund. Obviously, refunds don't take that long so we went back into the restaurant to ask about the refund. While we waited for a manager, one of the chefs came out and discussed how ""crazy"" the restaurant was and busy on Veteran's Day, and they messed up a lot of orders. I chuckled inside because I was thinking, first of all, a restaurant should be prepared to deal with demand, secondly; you mess up our orders all the time. Eventually, the manager came out who really seems to be like a nice guy; we have talked to him several times due to the multiple times our orders are botched. He offered us either our money back or a $25 gift card, so we accepted the gift card and left. Later, we wanted to grab dinner, so I ordered food from BJ's on their application. I ordered a sandwich and a turkey burger and within minutes my cell phone rang, it was BJs saying the order had come through as a large pizza and that the cooks in the back thought it was odd that a pizza had mayo on it, so they figured something had happened. What was confusing is the fact that they assumed it was a pizza, but they said all the customizations we added to our order were visible. My husband made sure they could see all of our customizations, asked about them, and they said they had the order correct, and it would be ready for pick-up shortly. When my husband went to pick up our order, after being in there for 20 minutes or so, he saw the turkey burger had a side salad with it. He questioned the worker saying that wasn't right, and she argued that the turkey burger comes with a side salad WITHOUT dressing. He said I know, but my wife changed her side to fries (why would you argue and what is the point of customizing an order if they can't get it right?). My husband then was obviously skeptical that the rest of the order was right, and he asked if the turkey burger had onions on it (I love onions and previously when I ordered the turkey burger they left onions off, which is stupid because one of the toppings it comes with IS onions), the worker replied that onions were on it because it comes on it. Well, thankfully my hubby is smart or just knows how bad they are, so he asked for some onions on the side. Anyway, we get home; I go to look at the toppings on my turkey burger and sure enough -- no onions. I could go on and on about all the times that they have messed up our order, and even though we had a gift card, we still paid too much for service and food like this. One other example, one time we placed a take-out order and ordered a specific pizookie - the restaurant wasn't able to see what flavor pizookie we wanted, and what flavors of ice cream, so instead of calling us, they gave us whatever they wanted (are you kidding? Prices are way too high for this kind of service). We are very loyal customers, and we won't be coming back anytime soon. Something with the way this restaurant runs is severely broken and obviously nothing is fixing it. The sad part is this was our first time being back since they messed up our previous order, and here they go again getting it wrong. It is sad that places like McDonald's mess up my order a lot less than a place that is much more expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler,3.24,3.59,3.508,,3.45

I have frequented this restaurant more than most people have, and have yet to have a bad experience. Honestly, it is hard to go wrong ordering anything off of the menu, but there are a few things which I highly recommend: the avacado rolls (warm, fried, slightly spicy, and a little messy), tortilla soup, ANY of the beers, the flat bread pizza, any of the burgers, ribs, french dip, and the pastas. This place is huge, so I have never had to wait long for a table. I would advise making a reservation ahead of time to skip the line (if there is one). It is also located close to the mall, so this place is a good stop for lunch or dinner (or both)! Great for groups and company outings.
