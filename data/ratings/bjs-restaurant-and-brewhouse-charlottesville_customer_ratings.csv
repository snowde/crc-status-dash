My friend got a very over dressed chopped salad. The best thing we had was the brussel sprout appetizer - very good! Still needs some work - but I understand they are newly opened.

67,Samantha J.,"Charlottesville, VA",43,6,,2.0,2016-11-11,"First, let me state that my experience was not terrible, it did leave much room for improvement.  I understood it was Veteran's Day and there was an abnormally large crowd that came in at one time.  But that was the issue, we waited 5 minutes looking at an utterly confused hostess trying to figure out how to seat everyone.  At first, I pondered - if they just opened, why wasn't the manager in the front helping this poor overwhelmed staff member nervously figuring out who to address first then who to sit first.  Well, we were sat and waited for almost 15 minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders.  Several staff members wandered in a lost daze, as I'm positive that servers were trying to figure out that groups were all sat down at once.  Our server was nice, apologetic, and explained the situation that nobody told her that her section was seated.  Of course, we weren't too bothered and proceeded to give our order.  Her section seemed to be filling up quickly and she went to attend those tables, but we understood.  We got our drinks but we also requested water as well because it was slightly warm in the building.  We requested water twice with our server and though we chalked it up to her forgetting our requests since she had a number of new tables seating in her section - after waiting for so long, the manager came by and we insisted on getting some water since our drinks that we did have were empty.  He immediately got it and then finally our server (freed from her other tables) came up with the waters we requested when we gave our order initially.  I talked with the manager and let him know our criticisms and though apologetic as well, speaking to the manager - we were only given an excuse to why things seemed so disorganized and we shouldn't blame the server or hostess for that.  I wasn't mad at all with them, I knew that this was a managerial fault and while he admitted that, a simple ""sorry that we've inconvenience you.  we hope to do better"" would have been sufficient, not the assumption that we were blaming the staff that were doing their best to work around the failures of management.  Other than that, the food was delicious and filling.  The staff were friendly, but there is definitely room for improvement.  Being sympathetic to new business awkwardness with having new staff and trying to figure out the flow of the general public on busy holidays, I hope that this review is a learning opportunity rather than a harsh criticism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville?start=60,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

56,Cherry F.,"Toano, VA",0,13,,5.0,2016-11-13,"Saturday night we called ahead for seating. Got there and found out they actually text you once it's ready but that was unclear during the phone conversation. They were packed and customers were angry at the wait and apparent confusion that followed. We waited 45 minutes in addition to the 15 minutes call ahead but the staff was nothing but charming and emphatic.  Once seated serving staff was amazing and instantly brought our starving children individual bread and fruit. Lifesaver. Ordered appetizer nachos (good), ahi tuna salad (good), baked ziti (excellent), jalapeño burger (excellent), boneless wings (pretty good) and baked cookies (yummy). Yes, getting seating is disorderly but they will figure that out. Servers were great.

My salmon was super salty, my daughter had Easy Mac, our friends thought the pizza was good, ribs needed a knife and fork to pry them off the bone, aka not good, and the burger was ""ok"". Server had NO CLUE about the menu- I asked him if a salad came with my salmon dish, he said ""I'm not sure"". He came back to ask which sides we wanted  with the ribs (he didn't know any sides came with when we placed the order) so we asked him what the choices were, to which he said ""I'm pretty sure there's a potato or some soups or a vegetable""... gee, helpful. He was very nice, but very uneducated about the products he was selling. I won't even mention his lack of beer knowledge in a brew house.

A lady brought it out with two very dirty glasses with lipstick stains and dirty finger prints on them and set the bottle down on the table without ever opening it. Everyone seemed super confuse of what to do with that bottle of wine at the table. Finally, she was getting trained on how to open it and serve it at the table while we all watched. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and no cheese (I'm allergic to dairy). The dish came out much later than everyone else's at the table, covered in cheese and no chicken. Our waitress took it back to fix it. It came out the second time with no cheese AND NO CHICKEN. At this point I didn't even want to eat anymore. I just asked for my chicken on the side. One of us order mozzarella sticks and said they tasted like they were made an hour ago. Very disappointed. With all of the mistakes made, we never saw the manager about the matter.

There was great interactions not only with my server but other servers and managers also. I'm a business owner in the food industry and I know that customer service is key to a successful business. I have it 4 stars based on the service however the food is another story. It is your typical box/frozen food that big box restaurants use. Being in Charlottesville which is known for local fresh farm to table food at most restaurants I was disappointed. That's what I expect when I sit down for a meal. Other than the box/frozen food it was a great experience and atmosphere.

Little bit of confusion during the hand-off from the hostess to the server, but it eventually worked out. Our server seemed to be pretty hurried, but she was nice and tried to be as helpful as she could. Started with the brussels sprouts for an appetizer, and they were amazing. Perfectly roasted and not oversauced. Dining companion ordered a Santa Fe Salad, which was massive. Unfortunately, the avocados mentioned in the menu somehow didn't make their way into the salad. Same for the roasted red peppers. And the kitchen went a little heavy on the dusting for ""presentation."" I ordered the California Chicken Club, which was pretty good. It was kind of light on the avocado as well, so maybe the kitchen was running low on stock when we were there. We finished things off with a Salted Caramel Mini Pizookie, which, as a grown-up, is a word I feel weird saying out loud.

I ordered the sliders which turned out to be one hamburger patty cut in quarters so you had this triangle sitting in the middle of a slider bun.

42,Kim C.,"Charlottesville, VA",43,5,1.0,1.0,2017-01-06,"We live close by and have given this place many chance based on the convince of their location, but continue to be disappointed. To start, their call ahead seating doesn't work, and they almost always tell you 15 minutes but it could range from 20-60 minutes. We alway give them a heads up that we have a toddler and it never fails (4 out of 6x) they sit us at a high top, which a high chair doesn't work. Don't order steak if you like it cooked a certain way, their rare steak is not the industry norm. Management did speak to us and apologize, unfortunately it wasn't authentic and we could see his irritation with us.  They do have Moscato! Our waitress told us they didn't but then heard another table order it. She apologized but still brought me the same drink as she did before. I didn't bother to let her know because at this point I need the alcohol!  Our most recent visit the fish tacos were still frozen! They comped those 2 meals but our friends ended up leaving hungry. During this same meal I asked our waitress for extra sauce, which she forgot. When the manager was at our table about the frozen fish I asked him for the extra sauce. He quickly defended the waitress and said he heard (sure) her order it and should be out any minute and said he'd be by shortly to make sure I got it. 15 minutes later I finally got it when I didn't need it. Management never came by to check on us during the 15 minutes. I will say we are going back, not that we are choosing to, but because everyone we are friends with seems to wanna try this place. And honestly, we keep hoping each time they will have made some drastic changes, I'll let ya know if they do!

I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and was glad to see the tentacles were included.  Most other restaurants in town serve it without and I always wondered why...the best part. I had the spicy peanut chicken w/soba noodles. It was delicious.  Server kept checking to see if all was okay. My sister-in law had the baby back ribs w/ fries. She said they were good and mozzarella sticks. I tried one and thought it was pretty good. Our friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  It looked good but she ended up taking it home and ordered the same for her husband. So I assumed she liked it. My sister -in law ordered the same cheeseburger to go for her hubby. The restaurant was probably a little over half full. Our server got kind of busy but still had plenty time for us.

However, it took a very long time for our food to come out. Once it got to the table, I was a little disappointed. I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and was excited for the dish of chicken, brussels sprouts, and brown rice. However, the dish was so filled with a lemony broth that it resembled soup. The chicken was tender and flavorful and the sprouts were well cooked, but the excess of broth ruined the dish for me. My sisters both ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and thought it was good, as did my dad with his burger. My mom ordered a deep dish cheese pizza and said it had lots of tomatoes, but was really nothing special. On top of all this, it also took forever for our check to come out, and 2 out of 3 stalls in the women's restroom were out of toilet paper.

He also got the golden beet salad. Very good. Got a very rare burger but it was delicious. I got the ahi tuna salad. ( hold the wonton strips) Tuna had no seasoning but there was wasabi on the side of the plate which helped. Salad and dressing were delicious but a bit overdressed. Next time will ask for dressing on the side.  We both got mini pizzookis ( molten cookie dough in a pizza pan with Ice cream on top) for dessert, mine gluten free. OMG. Cookie was the perfect combination of crunchy and gooey. Restaurant was very noisy with March Madness game on, music playing, and boisterous customers but fun. Our server was very sweet.

It took a very long time for our food to come out and our server didn't even check with us once if we need more water or anything until we called her.

Eventually we got tired of waiting for her to come back and get the bill that we just went up to another server and paid with them.

To be brutally honest, BJ's fails in all these major categories. I would be confident in stating that it's one of the WORST restaurants in this town. I mean it's embarrassing that a ""restaurant"" (more like a chain food feeding trough) like this is allowed to inhabit space in a town like Charlottesville, a foodie paradise.  Now, onto the food. The food is overpriced and awful. It's clearly microwaved and cooked in convection ovens, and is either incredibly bland or over spiced. If you want to eat microwave oven pizza and broccoli cooked in steamer packs, then this is the place for you. Also be sure that it's cooked how you originally asked for it, as it's usually made incorrectly. The service is so horrendously bad as the servers are poorly trained, inexperienced, or clearly just don't care. Whatever the day, something always gets messed up, or they've run out of something, or it takes forever to get your order of whatever. The only semi-decent thing to be salvaged is the beer and cocktail menu - but one can find just as good at another restaurant. The servers are clearly stressed out all the time and the management seems poor, as the bad service seems to be a direct result of bad management. Just sitting there is depressing because the atmosphere feels affected by the frustration of both the staff and other customers.  Overall, there are actual good chain restaurants to visit like Travinia and Sedona. Hell, even Mission BBQ right next door is a tremendously better option. Never again will I waste my time and money coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
14,Mike J.,"Greenbrier West, Chesapeake, VA",0,2,3.0,5.0,2017-10-24,The beer hit the spot. We each had a flight of four beers and we were happy with all of them. The seared I he salad was wonderful.

16,Ashley H.,"Richmond, VA",0,3,2.0,2.0,2017-10-26,"We had high hopes when we went here. We were seated immediately and they were not all that busy. After being seated we sat for almost 30 minutes without being greeted, I had to go to the host to tell them we needed to be served and we still we not helped right away. They did take care of a free appetizer but nothing including the food was better than average. We had high hopes and it was a huge let down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
2,Lewis W.,"Ruckersville, VA",1,65,37.0,4.0,2017-10-30,"We had relatives come from out of town and one is sensitive to gluten. Looking online we found BJ's had an extensive gluten-free menu, so we thought we'd try it.  Everyone seemed happy with what they ordered, I got a half rack of ribs, baked potato, & mozzarella and tomato salad, a ""special"" at $18.95. The salad had a nice strong balsamic sauce, but I think the potato was microwaved (or it may have just been reheated in the microwave) and the ribs were just average but not terrible. The service was okay, they definitely tried, but it could've been better. We'd go back to try other things on the menu but I thought it was a little pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
30,K T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,5,,2.0,2017-11-06,"We really want this place to improve, but after several visits, it still suffers from service issues.  The staff is friendly, but service is GLACIAL.  There will appear to be plenty of servers on staff, so perhaps the problem is lack of good management.  Food is decent, and places in this category are desperately lacking in Charlottesville, so we want them to succeed- but this is not the place to go if you're in a hurry, whether it's a weekday or a weekend, even if sitting in the bar.     Updating 2 months and at least 3 repeat visits later - wow.  Every time we go here, it's a different waitstaff and manager crew, and yet somehow - still no improvement.  Tonight we waited 40 minutes for our bar drinks, and our appetizers arrived well before those drinks. Our son ordered a bacon cheeseburger and somehow ended up with a plain burger, no toppings whatsoever.  Our waitress was not to blame- she even said she would (and did) stand at the bar until our drinks were ready to bring our.  This restaurant always staffs the bar (that serves the entire restaurant) with only one bartender, so the bar is always behind- whether it's a slow night or a busy one.  Who knows what's going on in the kitchen that we had that burger breakdown.  Manager was apologetic but ineffective, and c'mon folks, how many chances should we give you??  I think this Cville family - who eats out often and is always willing to give the benefit of the doubt-  is done trying.  The two stars are generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

5,Gayle A.,"Front Royal, VA",4,2,,1.0,2017-11-26,"Had the Santa Fe salad. Good flavors but the majority of the lettuce was the rib part of the romaine instead of the leafy part. I tried to ignore it, cut it up into smaller parts, etc. but was left with very little content.  I've had and made enough salads in my life to know this should not have been served that way. I did eat what I could b/c I was hungry, but when the server came to remove our plates, I showed her what I wasn't able to eat, which was size able.   She whisked it away and I heard her telling a manager about it as I went to the restroom. No compensation was offered and because of that we won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
1,Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,668,,4.0,2017-12-15,"My experience with BJ's Charlottesville is much more positive than that of some of the other Yelpers. In general, BJ's is an absolutely reliable chain. The room is good. The food is good. There are a ton of good-for-you items that also taste good.  So your mouth and your cardiologist are both happy. I ate here with another experienced BJ's veteran.  Both us got normal BJ's food - which means first rate.  Both of us felt the C'ville was more or less the same as other national BJ's. Service was a little slow - but nothing out of the ordinary. But basically we ate well. So I am writing a four star review - and my dining partner would have done the same. If you read other Yelper's reviews, You get some people who like the place - and some people who moan and groan about terrible service and miscooked food. In the bad reviews, the horrible-terrible stories occurred not so long ago. It could be that there has been a recent management change - and things have been repaired in the last few weeks. It could be that we got lucky and the C'Ville BJ's under normal conditions is a much worse place. It could be that BJ's Charlottesville got unlucky and drew a pack of unfair Yelp reviewers. (Hey, those things happen.) My best guess is that this particular BJ's had some difficulties during the start-up period - but it is pulling out of the slump. If you want, you can wait for more Yelpers to write reviews, and then go in only when there seems to be a run of good reviews. Or you could take your chances now. BJ's was absolutely fine when we were there. My guess is that your experience will be much the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
0,Howard S.,"Chicago, IL",1,107,,3.0,2017-12-27,"Every review here is absolutely true.  In general the food is good, the staff is friendly but lazy and inattentive, the place is clean, the drinks are good and the prices run from a little high but reasonable to kind of outrageous. First the outstanding: The sriracha brussel sprouts appetizer is fantastic and at $6.50 it is an outstanding deal. Next the good: The weekend prime rib deal is a DEAL Then the bad: The staff tries but is totally discombobulated, ill trained and generally missing in action. But they are SUPER friendly. The worst: They are 86 on a lot of items on a regular basis. Don't advertise a beer if it's out of stock, take the plaque of the wall. If custom sodas are your specialty don't run out of black cherry soda.  And don't expect to get a bargain. We usually get one appetizer for 4 people, 4 entrees, 2 beers and 2 sodas, and it consistently comes out to between $35 and $40 per person with tax and tip. But a BIG part of that is the high taxes in Charlottesville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
11,Erin J.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-08,"This place is absolutely terrible. Went here with a group and never coming back. Ordered a glass of wine, and all I got was the decanter and no glass, so I'm awkwardly sitting there while my friends are all having their drinks. Servers looked like they clearly didn't want to be there, which showed in the terrible service and unprofessionalism. We also got their ""craft beer,"" which was nothing but watered down tasteless garbage. One of the other Yelpers here wrote that their beer isn't fit to serve as detergent at any of the actual breweries in Cville - absolutely true. What's even worse than the beer is the food itself. Overpriced and gross. You can stay at home and have your TV dinner for a fraction of the price. Our server couldn't even get our orders right, and was totally inattentive. Saw the general manager, who looked to be about the size of Jupiter, waddling about. Did nothing to remedy our bad experience. Honestly the worst restaurant I've ever been to. With so many better options in Cville, save your money and don't come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-charlottesville,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
