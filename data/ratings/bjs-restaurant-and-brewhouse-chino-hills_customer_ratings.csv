My Wife has Celiac Disease which is an allergy to most grains. After waiting for about 20 minutes for a seat in the bar we were seated and placed drink orders. In the next 10 minutes we were asked if we wanted to order drinks by three more servers. We finally told one of the servers that we were still waiting for a Beer and a Margarita, We finally got them. My Wife ordered the Gluten Free Pizza and a salad. The salad was served with croutons on it (dried bread) which had to be remade, I was finished with my salad by the time they brought one without croutons for my Wife. Her salad was delivered at the same time as her pizza and my gumbo came after she had finished he salad and two pieces of pizza. After we were finished we couldn't find our server to get the check, found out that her shift had ended and she went home. The manager had to find the bill and we were finally out of there fifteen minutes after we were done eating. I have eaten at B J's all over the country but won't go to the one that is three minutes from my front door. This was the second time I had very poor service at this B J's.

It was only AFTER telling the waitress that we would never return, that the manager took care of our check.   I wish I could give zero stars, but I will have to be satified with the one star and say that ""I will NEVER return to this restaurant"".

At last, BJ's. They stay open until midnight, definitely no nightlife crowds, no parking impossibilities, nor creepy neighborhoods. Just right for old fogies like us.

I opted for trying the beignet. Still hot from being freshly fried, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon sugar that had crystalized into a thin crust, then topped with a little ice cream, whipped cream, slices of fresh strawberries, and strawberry sauce.

We placed our name and were given a pager. On a Sunday busy as usual. We were seated in the designated time frame of 15 minutes. This is all that went right. Our hostess a young girl very flighty in her 20's sat us at a 4 person table. There were 6 of us. We asked her why and she said nothing. My wife went back and said that the table was too small. She replied to her co-worker that they shouldn't have been sat there. She did it and blamed him. We were directed to the main lobby to wait again. After 15 minutes I asked about our wait time as they took our pager from the previous round. The man at the desk asked my name and didn't know we were waiting. I asked the hostess when she returned and she said ""oh they are still here"". Should have left then. Orders were taken relatively efficiently. 4 of my family members said their food was ""ok"". They ordered chicken, a burger, pasta, and a pizza respectively. I ordered a three meat deep dish pizza. One of the worst I have ever had. $14 for a small. It had no sauce. Meat, cheese and tons of dough. No sauce! Extremely dry to place it mildly. I tried but sent it back after a few bites. Drink refills were non existent without major prompting. My wife ordered angel hair pasta that was bland and the shrimp with it were so spicy it was not tolerable. I tried one shrimp and it was very spicy. I downed my drink and was told over 4 times that another tea would be brought. They removed my wife's glass and said they would return. Never did. She had to physically leave our table to get his attention. I returned my pizza (if that was pizza, I'm not sure). My waiter asked if there was anything else I wanted and I said another tea would be nice. He never returned until I asked for the check. The manager came and spoke to me directly and asked the same.

330,Rollence P.,"Pasadena, CA",18,47,4.0,1.0,2014-07-28,"This review is for the service and not for the food. Our waiter was ""Don"" (Donald was the server name on the bill). I will refer to him as Mr. Smug.  When Mr. Smug approached us to take our drink orders, I asked him if there were any shareable salads.  ""You can share anything on the menu,"" was Mr. Smug's reply. Really? I did not know that. Thank you for enlightening me.  For those of you who don't know, BJ's menu is as thick as a user manual for an electronic device. I figured that the waiter would be more knowledgeable and would save us time with a recommendation since I only saw small side salads while there were ""shareable appetizers."" He finally directed me to an area in the menu that served salads as an entree which would be bigger than the other salads that I was looking at. See, it wasn't that difficult.  Right, Mr. Smug?  When he brought our drinks over, he proceeded to throw the coasters on the table like he was dealing a deck of cards minus the accuracy and finesse. When one person from my party started to move her coaster closer toward herself, Mr. Smug started ""Hey, hey why are you moving the coaster farther away from me? I have to reach over now!"" I thought he was joking because we were a party of four in a booth (Yeah, I know. LARGE party). And Mr. Smug appeared to be at least as tall, if not taller than me at 6'2"". Long reach. If he was trying to be a comedian, then he needs to keep his day job. Wait, this IS his day job. Hmmm... After we finished our mains, the table was clear and we were ready for dessert. Mr. Smug comes by and places the check at our table. I didn't ask for the check. And the dessert did not come with him. I then mentioned to him that we still have dessert on the way.  ""I know."" He said. Awkward pause.  I then mentioned that I didn't ask for the check and since he ""knew"" we weren't finished eating, then why bring the check?  ""So you don't feel comfortable with the check at your table right now?"" Mr. Smug asked.  Another awkward pause as I am still holding the check up in the air for him to take it, ""Ah, I would like the check when we are finished eating. Thanks."" He then proceeded to mention that during lunch, they tend to bring the check earlier because some people are in a rush because it is their business lunch hour etc. We were wearing shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops. I guess that screamed ""We are in a rush to get back to work!""  ""Do you bring the check even before all courses have been served?"" I asked.  ""Yeah, for lunch it's policy."" Mr. Smug replied. ""Wait, so during lunch, bringing the check before are all courses are served is policy?"" I verified. ""Yeah."" Mr. Smug said.  That seemed strange.  After our meal and our check, I spoke to the manager asked about this ""policy."" To credit her management skills, she was lovely and not defensive at all and somewhat apologetic. She mentioned that the wait staff can opt to bring the check earlier if they ""read"" the customers might be in a rush.  ""The check can be brought either with or after the last course."" (paraphrasing what she said).  I asked, is it ""policy"" to bring the check before all courses are served?"" ""No. It is not policy. There is no policy for that. The servers need to 'read' their customers."" She replied.  I told her that Mr. Smug's tone towards me and my family was somewhat disprespectful. And he could have answered all of my questions in a different way, but he chose the snarky path instead. She wanted to offer me coupons, but I don't see how that could correct the situation, so I kindly declined. What she failed to do was to mention what she would do about my concerns with Mr. Smug's service. I don't want him out of a job. That's not my goal especially in this economy. Just treat people with decency. That's all. After reading some of the other reviews regarding customer service, I guess I am not an anomaly.

For perspective, whenever the last person in my party is finished with their meal, I'm quick to ask for the check -- I am conscientious about making the table available for others who are waiting.  So, when a restaurant is only around 60% filled, I don't expect or appreciate being hurried through a half-eaten meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=240,3.48,3.19,3.19,2.732,3.306
427,L L.,"Corona, CA",197,25,,1.0,2014-08-14,"One time I came to this location and had the ABSOLUTE worst service that I have ever experienced before. My mom and I came here and asked for a booth one weekday night. The hostess told us that we had to wait extra, which we replied that we didn't mind. Another group came in and asked for a booth as well, and they were seated right away at a booth. So we went to ask about our table, it had been 20 minutes since we put our name down. They said our table was ready and sat us at a table top, not a booth. We had waited 20 minutes for a regular table... We politely reminded them that we had asked for a booth, so we stood in the restaurant while they cleaned a booth for us. Then the waiter came and dropped off the menus, but did not acknowledge us or ask for our drink order. He went over to another table to go talk with some girls who were just seated right after us. It took another 10 minutes for him to come over and FINALLY acknowledge us, and get our drink order. Another 10 minutes and our drinks didn't come yet, but the girls' table already got their appetizers and drinks (because it had been 20 min since we were all seated). Finally, after 50 minutes of coming into the restaurant, we were upset. We asked the hostess at the front to speak to the manager. She got the manager (shift manager) and proceeded to tell him (while we could hear her) that we were rude and impatient. So we went and talked with the new shift manager, told him our story and that we were leaving but that we wanted to let him know that we would never come back. He apologized and gave us a complimentary gift card, and spoke with the rude hostess and waiter.

Endured the 35 minute long drive from near the OC to meet up with a friend coming in FROM Victorville, so this was our half-way point. Not much else going on in this large commercial area except for several more restaurants, so not sure if this is THE restaurant row. Got three appetizers to share -  nothing terrible nor outstanding, just good food. Ahi Poke: wish there was a way to get this as a meal sized portion - maybe double the ahi? It was very good, chunks of ahi and avocado, dressed lightly and served with a few (like 5 or 6) tortilla chip triangles. Sliders: 4 mini burgers to a serving, with cheddar cheese, a two to three bite per person appetizer.  Bread was grilled and toasted and was nicely crisped. They could not accommodate a request for blue cheese on one of them. Burgers were a tad too well done for my taste, but it was going to be shared so did not request medium rare.  Served with your choice of potato strings or wedges, dill pickles and a pile of shredded lettuce.  Calamari: slightly less crispy than I desired, but still tender calamari rings and tentacles, served with a white dressing and  marinara on the side. Not sure if the white dressing was tartar, ranch  or blue cheese ( not detectably different in taste).

The few things I would change with this place (which probably isn't possible with the current layout) - their bar area needs to be a lot bigger. It takes a good 20 minutes of waiting sometimes to be able to snag a seat up on that level.

192,OldSchool IE ..,"Chino Hills, CA",1,23,48.0,3.0,2014-11-30,"If this was a few years or so back, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse would have been 5*.   Today at most 3* and this why: 1.  Although the Chino Hills location is newer compared to Covina, Covina used to have brew operations.  If correct, many BJ locations a few years back brewed on site.  This is no longer the case.  Now, all beer is shipped in from a single location. Understanding this was a business decision, it thwarted the local brewers ability to make many great ""one-off"" offerings.  I remember getting a beer that may only be brewed in Covina for example.   Local brewers would experiment with different concoctions which is no longer the case.   Chino Hills (which did not brew) may be the closest location to me, but it was the unique offerings that led me to go out to Covina and other locations.  I actually enjoyed visiting multiple BJ's within the region.   2.  BJ's KILLED their happy hour menu about a year ago.    One thing that my family enjoyed about Happy Hour was they had a solid happy hour menu with great offerings, portions, and price.   This is not longer the case with a menu change last year with many items we've enjoyed scratched!  Also portions were cut down to size with price increases. 3.  About a year ago, BJ's took away my NUMBER ONE ITEM I LOVED ON THE MAIN MENU; the Open Face Chili Burger with wedge cut fries! If not visiting BJ's for Happy Hour and resorting to the main menu, I always got the open face Chili Burger.  The Piranha Ale made Chili was ""BOMB.COM!""  The only time I can get chili now is during lunch with the Giant Stuffed Potato or in a Sourdough bowl.  Both very good, but it's not the same as having that open faced chili burger I loved so much. All these changed happened right when the Chino Hills location got up and running.  I recall the server in Chino Hills stating that Chino Hills was a test place for the so called ""CRAPPY"" new and more healthier menu.  BJ's wanted to change their image ... personally I don't know why?   Maybe they wanted more of a wine crowd. Ok, on to today... my family and I frequent BJ's at least once a month (used to be 5-6/month) mainly for a change up from other now better gastropubs and the seasonal beer offerings which two of my favorites are the Pumpkin Ale and Grand Cru.   I can drink their Grand Cru daily; it's that good if into Belgian style of beers.  Their pumpkin is always solid, but since going to consolidated brewing I recall one year they had it forever while another another they ran out fast and we missed it. Consolidated brew operations don't bother me as much the menu change last year.   It's really the menu change; especially happy hour menu, that caused my family not to frequent BJ's as much as we used to.   As I write this, I still can't believe they killed what was an awesome happy hour as well taking the open chili face burger off the menu to make way for more healthier items.   When drinking a good beer, I want hearty good beer food.  With that menu change they should be making wine instead of beer; seriously! Bring back the OLD BJs!   Bring back the Open Face Chili Burger at least!   How can you scratch something that was made with your own beer product.   If I want something more healthier, I'll go a few buildings down to Souplantation!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=140,3.28,3.22,3.22,2.7960000000000003,3.2440000000000007

Food was good and came out relatively quickly for a large group.  We did want to split the check and that part was the only negative and the reason for my three stars versus four.  They had us do one large check then try to denote who's was who's and then split it out - it took over 35 minutes to get that to happen.  I recommend not trying this here and some how dividing your large party differently when you have the orders taken as it was a mess.  Not the servers fault as he was helpful but it just honestly took way too long All the kids were happy with their kids meals and the portions and flavors of the adult meals really hit the spot after a long day of softball.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=200,3.32,3.21,3.21,2.7,3.254

No more mention of well drinks but a 1$ off cocktails and draft beer as well as glass of wine. If you were to compare the old & new happy hour menu it is a little vague & will keep the servers busy answering questions. I preferred the old one because you didn't need an actual menu to see the shareable appetizers it listed them on the table and under each price range.

When we walked in we weren't greeted because there was no one at the hostess station (odd). Stood there for a good 3 minutes before being approached, and we're finally seated.  A waitress finally came to our table and we all knew what we wanted; pizookies. While talking to the waitress we learned very quickly that she had a sarcastic attitude. (sidenote: we're a cool group of ppl we can take a joke and all have a sense of humor.) But for whatever reason she kept coming at my friend, a female, for no reason. It was to the point where my friend asked us, 3 guys 1 girl, did she come at the waitress a certain way or was every statement/question that was made valid, and if she (my friend) had an attitude? Needless to say we reassured her that she did nothing wrong and that it was the waitress... Finally our pizookies came. These were great! I had the trio: salted caramel, chocolate chunk, and triple chocolate! PERFECTION. To be honest this was an overload and probably could have put me in a diabetic coma lol.

The workers charged the batteries in hopes of finding us one day. They knew who to look for because our family picture is the screen saver. We are crazy grateful and still can't believe it.

Additionally, the bar gets very crowded, but I think that's all a testament to the quality of food and the atmosphere. We generally order ahead and I pick food up on the way home from work. This location has a separate counter for take out orders, so you can avoid the hectic-ness up front. They also have curbside delivery - you park, call them, and they'll bring the food to your car - if you're lucky enough to get one of the 3 curbside spaces.  BJ's has a very extensive menu and though the sandwiches and fries are good, we generally stick with the pizza. You really can't go wrong. The Mediterranean and the White pizzas are our go-to's.

151,Jeffrey R.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,159,7.0,1.0,2015-12-18,"What a disaster. My wife, and child went to BJ's and saw they were pretty crowded. Typical for a Friday night. Wait was 30-40 mins but we saw a family leaving from the bar area. We went over and were able to grab their booth as they left.   Waitress was super friendly, came over, cleaned the table and took our drink orders.  3 waters, 1 beer and a Sprite.  The drinks came quickly and the waitress said she would be right bak to take our orders.  That was the longest, ""right back"" ever. Our waitress never did come back. In fact, we never saw her again. After 10 mins of waiting for her to return, I got up and asked the bartender where our waitress was. He shrugged, so I asked if I could order our dinners through him. He said he couldn't, we would have to wait for our waitress.  Makes sense, right?  So I went back and sat for another 10 minutes when a waitress went and helped the booth behind us. I stopped her and told her we needed to place our food order.  She told us she wasn't our waitress, but she would find ours.  5 mins goes by and the waitress who went looking for ours returned, with an attitude and said, ""I guess I'll be taking your order.""  Oh, sorry.... we are the one's waiting nearly 40 mins to place our order and you are the one being annoyed??  We placed our order which was a childs mac n cheese, one of those cookie pies, a chicken balsamic plate and a ribeye steak.  Another 10 mins go by, no water re-fills, no asking for another drink, nothing.  We saw our waitress but it was obvious she was intentionally avoiding 1/2 the tables...  I finally walk up to the bartender and ask if he could check on our food.  After our waitress saw me talk to the bartender, she came over and asked if everything was alright. I told her we have been at the restaurant for almost an hr. and we needed more water and our dinners.  She left and came back asking, ""I'm sorry, what did you order again?""  Really??  We repeated our order and I asked what the problem was.  She walked away, cam back and said she was sorry but the kitchen lost our ticket.... I couldn't believe it. So, we ordered again. Within 5 mins we got what was supposed to be our dinners, except my daughters mac and cheese was ice cold, my chicken looked ok from the top, but for some reason I couldn't cut it. When I flipped the chicken over, I saw why. The bottom wasn't overcooked, it was char burnt. The knife wouldn't even cut through it.   My wife's steak looked perfect, but since her family couldn't eat, she said, ""Lets go.""  I couldn't agree more.  We told the waitress we were too annoyed and frustrated and wanted to leave.  She left and brought me the bill.... LOL.. oh my gosh... I told my wife I would meet her in the car and she took my daughter and left.  I told the waitress she was crazy if she felt the need to give me the bill.  She said she would get the manager. I waited for 5 mins and no one came. I got up and left....  Whats happened to this place? We used to really enjoy coming here.  Oh well, Im sure they don't need our business seeing how busy they are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=180,3.56,3.3,3.228,2.084,3.4040000000000004

Then the GRACE M. came up to me, telling there is no bacon, they will bring out later. It never came.  I decided to send the burger back. GRACE M. never offered me something else to eat. It took a manager to come up to me and offer me something else. But I was not going to wait another 20-30 minutes. Overall, the experience was terrible because of our waitress, GRACE M.

161,E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17.0,1.0,2016-04-08,"Congratulations BJ's, well at least this one. You are the first ever restaurant to get a 1 star..... whaaat! A BJ's, just keep reading and I'll explain.  First of all I like this franchise as a whole, pizza is good and I've had good times with friends at other locations.... but this one just plain out sucks. If you follow me I review pretty fairly, I give credit where credit is due, and owning a restaurant I know can be difficult. So I don't like giving negative reviews cause it brings the hard work of the owner down... but this was just plain out sad. We didn't even eat. Ok so here's what happened, my parents had to catch a flight so any restaurant with a 20+ minute wait we couldn't go to. So when we came here, we actually got seated immediately, so plus on them.... sadly that only plus isn't enough to even give it a 2 star. When we got seated, which this part was a minor gripe, my jacket got dirty from some sauce left on the table. Ok so I get it, if a waiter/waitress misses a spot on a table. For a place like this, it happens, I'll let that slide. If it were a higher end place then it's a bigger deal, but here it's not.  So we waited....and waited...and waited. Remember that whole ""cause my parents had a flight thing"" so anything past 20 minutes we couldn't go too! We waited for over 25 minutes. To our frustration, we asked a waiter if someone could help us. He looked confused so he said he'll get someone.... 10 minutes later still no one. So that was a 35 minute wait and still no one, not even to ask how we're doing. So we left. We were gonna be late.  I can see someone in the comment saying ""if you were in a hurry you shouldn't have gone there in the first place."" Well yeah you are right.... that's why we ask the hostess in the front how long the wait is. If we get seated immediately, then that means all is good and you shouldn't have to wait an additional 35 minutes for someone to come and assist you. Even if we weren't in a hurry, that's just sad. So we didn't eat and had to get something quick instead somewhere else. We just stormed out, they didn't try to stop us, which shows they didn't give a damn. So why should I? Epic fail, I'm never coming back to this BJ'S ever, and I live practically next door to it. I'd rather order pizza delivery than come back here again cause of how sh!tty the service was... if you even want to count not attending to your customer service... look I'm even cussing, that's how pissed I am.

First the hostess at the front stated the wait will be half hour and this was 7:38pm and we got seated at 8:42om.  Our waitress is Kristen T.  When we ordered appetizer ""calamari"" the portions were much smaller.  Our waitress Kristen said the portions are made smaller because the customers don't finish the calamari.  Then we got our Dinner we ordered the cherry chipotle glazed Salmon.  Now this dish I usually order all the time.  My cousin tried this dish as well.  When the other server gave us our dish,  I noticed and was also surprised that it was half the portion.  So I got the menu and compared our meals to the picture from the menu, and it was truly less than half the size.  I also explained to my family I usually always order this and that this is the first time I had it like this and so small.  So when Kristen our waitress came by I had asked her did they also make this dinner smaller too?  Kristen said that the portions are the same but used a different dish.  So I let Kristen know I usually order this and no never had it served like tonight.  She replied I will let my manager know about your meal.  So minutes after Roxy introduced herself, and she asked about our meals so I had  explained to her about the portions of our salmon.  Roxy responded and said I wish I saw your meal and what can she do?  I replied to her that she should let her cooks know that they're not making the right portions for this dinner.  So she apologized and walked away.  Than Kristen came with the bill and let us know they charged us half for the two salmon dishes.  I started writing this review and another manger Ryan approached us, and he said he sees I'm doing a review and he asked how many people follow me, and I said many.  I explained again everything again and he asked me what can he do to make it up to us?  I replied to him that the bill has been paid and that my family member paid it already, & that I felt we shouldn't of been charged for   the salmon dishes. he took off both the salmon dishes. Overall BJs made up for their mistakes but let's hope they don't cheat other customers the portions of their meal, and the managers should of address this situation correctly and right away.  Why should anyone have to write a review to get things corrected, or base on how many followers.  I will go back to BJ's and hope this cook, or cooks don't make the same mistakes, and that the portions of the appetizer are made less because customers don't finish the appetizer dishes.  Based on waitress Kristen T excuse for the portions of their appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=140,2.48,2.98,3.132,2.216,2.7800000000000002
223,Ryan J.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,2016-05-21,"Terrible management. I took my family to BJ's last night for dinner. My wife and 3 girls. They gave us a booth near a side door in a room with a large party set up. As the party started to arrive they opened a back door for the guests to come in. This allowed cold air to flood into the room. I wouldn't normally care but we had our infant daughter with us and the cold air was blowing right on to her. I got up and asked the manger, who I later found out was named Ryan, if he would close the door. He rudely and arrogantly told me they would close it when all the party was there. This was a large party. The guy was a jerk. Apparently my family and I aren't as important as the large party. Having worked in restaurant for a long time I would like to give Ryan, the short manager with glasses at the chino hills BJ's some advice on how to handle this next time. When your guest comes up and asks for the door to be closed because he and his family are uncomfortable you can do these things. 1. Politely explain the situation, that the party has many older guests who have trouble with the stairs and that he will do his best to close it ASAP. 2. Offer to move us to another table. 3. Have one of your employees stand at the door and open it for the part as they come, this way the door doesn't have to be open for 20 minutes. 4. When your guests come up to you ask for anything, Try not to be such a smug jerk, remember that we are spending money at your restaurant also. You are in the service industry, try and remember that.

90,Anita W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",463,140,94.0,1.0,2016-06-27,"My friends and I came here for dinner about a month ago and had a really bad experience.  Let me start by saying that I have been a little dissatisfied with BJ's recently.  They took my favorite salad off the menu, they changed some other items on the menu and their service standards seem to be slipping.  Hence the reason why I had not been to BJ's in a while until the fateful night in May.   My two best friends from high school and I had a little impromptu get together one night.  We decided to run out to get something to eat.  We got to BJ's at about 8pm and were told that we would have to wait for a table.  No problem...but hurry it up, we are starving and by the looks of us we haven't missed many meals and I'm not about to start now.  We got to our table and the server came to take our drink orders.  We had our orders ready for him because we were starving (did I already say I haven't missed many meals in this life?).   The drinks were delivered and we settled in to wait for our meals...and wait....and wait...and wait.  At about the 30 minute mark we asked our server to please check on our meals.  He goes into the back and the manager, Karen, comes to our table a little while later to tell us that our pizza was dropped on the floor.  We explain that we are hangry and she says she will bring out an appetizer to our table.  She gave us a few ""quick"" options and we chose a spinach artichoke dip.  She told us that it would be right out.  Okay!  Bring it on!  Fifteen minutes later and the dip is delivered to the table.  We all take big dollops and put them on our plates.  We dip a chip and take a bite.  NO!  The dip is stone cold.  Literally had been dumped in the bowl from the refrigerator and brought out to us.  No attempt to heat it at all.  We ask our server to please get Karen, and she comes to the table and apologizes.  Then she asks us if she can bring us more.  Um, no thanks.  We then asked her where our pizza was because she last came to our table over 20 minutes ago to tell us that our pizza had been dropped on the floor.  Off she goes to check on the pizza. Another 10 minutes go by and our server brings our pizza out.  We all take a slice and note to each other that, while the pizza is hot...it is not steaming hot.  It has obviously been sitting in the pass for at least five minutes.  We fell on that pizza and ate like we had just been held prisoner somewhere and only given water and bread for a week.  Karen checks in on us and we tell her that we don't think we should have to pay for the pizza.  She tells us that she will ""do something for us.""  At this point we are beyond angry and we mention to our server that they need to take the pizza off the bill.  He is unimpressed with us and tells us he can't do anything about it.   My friend then gets up from the table and goes over to speak with Karen.  She tells her that we have been at BJ's for over an hour and a half, and this meal was mediocre at best.  She explains that she was a server for a long time and her dad was in the restaurant business her whole life.  Karen finally capitulates and comps our pizza.  We paid for the drinks we had and left the server a nice tip (even though he had a bit of an attitude).  Bottom line, this further solidifies to me that a restaurant I used to frequent will no longer get my business.  I don't know what has been going on with the menu and service except that BJ's has probably grown too fast for corporate to keep up their standards.   I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=80,3.04,3.06,3.14,2.052,3.0520000000000005

My waitress (Grace M) acted like we were a burden on her life from the second we were seated. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she was having a bad day, I work customer service as well so I know Monday's aren't always the best but Jesus. Not one smile, not one you're welcome or no problem, nothing. I spilt a drink (accidents happen to the best of us) and I told her about the incident hoping she would bring extra napkins considering I used our only two cloth napkins to attempt to clean the mess, nope, no such luck. We sat at a sticky table, our food, napkins, phones soaked from the mess. Her response was ""would you like another beer?"" Like um no I would like a napkin but yeah the only thing she came back with was our check. At that point we noticed her and another waitress standing around and talking and looking directly at us. Okay so now we want to talk about customers to other waiters? I asked to speak to a manager and his only resolution was to discount our items to happy hour price WHICH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ALREADY HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED TO THAT PRICE. Awful experience, awful service, and I will never come back. So be weary if you come during happy hour or have this woman as your waitress.

I have never in my life had something like that happen to me.  At that time my fiance suggested that this be the last time that we dined at this location, but I wanted to give it another try, and this recent time we once again did not receive the best service.

The waitress and bartender did do well as one mistake is absolutely tolerable on their side of this experience in my humble opinion But as a Date Night seeking Customer  if I was in the pizza business I would make sure that my main focus as a manager would be not to be a "" social butterfly at the rail by the wall""  and focus less on damage control and more on food preparation to ensure the we served HOT,Properly prepared Wings and Pizza ( which I am Positive BJ's corporate folks pride themselves on) so our customers can leave with food in the belly and a thought that we would return to this spot again on the next search for "" A good Meal"".

We go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse of course! BJ's has been a great partner in the communities to military and first responders for years, and they even have a parking space reserved for combat wounded veterans...very cool!   Now to the drinks: We started with a four taster custom brew-set with the Blonde (light and sweet), Hefeweizen (malty deliciousness), Red Ale (smooth but strong), and the Goliath Imperial (9.0 ABV). I must mention that our server, David M., created this sample, and his assistance with the selections was spot on.  I ended up ordering a pint of the Red Ale afterward because it was perfect and less ABV than the Goliath Imperial.  Now the food: We ordered the Sriracha Brussel Spouts, the 10 Piece Bone-In Wings, and the California Club Flatbread Pizza. OMGoodness, the sprouts were tangy, earthly, and the fried corners were delicious. If you have not tried the sprouts, please do yourself a favor and experience greatness.  The wings were great, and the flatbread was good. We finished most it and took the rest home. Now to the service: This was the BEST service we have experienced in a long time; anywhere.

Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to air my complaints about the very poor managerial service that I received at your restaurant in Chino Hills on the 15th of October which have spoiled our high expectations of your restaurant and eventually spoiled the evening for my family. We were a party of 12 arriving at approximately 10 pm.  Kassandra, our server took very good care of us the entire time.  Karen Keys, manager on duty, however, did not.   After completing our late dinner, we ordered 1 pizookie for all to share.  My niece took a bite and unfortunately spit out a large piece of glass.  Mind you, we all took bites that may have had small pieces of glass as well.  We informed our server who immediately reported it to Karen.  Perhaps the worse part is when Karen approached our table with an unnecessary comment/question, ""Who's the lucky person?"". My husband expressed his disappointment and we all wished that she had been more apologetic rather than sarcastic.  After stating that she wanted to take care of half of our bill, she gave my niece a $25 BJ's gift card and took off 2 appetizers from our total.  Not quite half, as our  total was $192 including tip. Instead of having to speak with Karen again, we opted to just fill out the incident report and leave the establishment.    We dine at this particular restaurant quite often, but sadly, I don't think we'll ever return.  A good number of our party have either worked at a restaurant or are currently working in the restaurant industry.  We believe in giving and receiving great customer service.  We were appalled at the way in which this incident was handled.  Working in health care myself, I know that this incident has the potential of causing great harm.  Having said this, we do not take this incident lightly.  We are upset and hope you can rectify this situation.

Flavor was alright. I wanted to try something new and this was the lucky pick. I thought the fish was a little overcooked. Can't say I'd order it again...

I like their deep dish pizza, jambalaya, and recently tried their deep dish ziti. The ziti was pretty good and filling, though there was a lot of oil at the bottom of the pan equivalent to 1.5-2 shot glasses of grease. I'm guessing it's from all the cheese and tomatoes in the dish. Despite the pool of grease, the taste was good but not mind-blowing.

122,Becca D.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,143,59.0,1.0,2017-06-30,"Came in on a Monday at around 6 pm and it was a nightmare. We waited over 30 minutes for our table of 7. When we were seated, we were put in a corner of the restaurant where there were tons of open tables (we were wondering why we couldn't have been seated there earlier?).  The waiter took our drink orders, most of us got water with lemon. He brought waters without lemons, and when my aunt tried to ask him about the lemons he answered quickly ""I'm going to bring you guys a bowl of lemons."" Okay, sure. He takes our food order. And then time passes... It took atleast another 35 minutes for us to get our food. Meanwhile, we were absolutely freezing. Its summer and hot so no one brought sweaters, but it was FREEZING to the point where it was super uncomfortable and my cousin and I were trying to use our napkins as blankets. We tailed our waiter down(wasn't the easiest) and asked to turn the air down and he said he would tell a manager. Not sure if it happened. When the food finally arrived, I asked again about the lemons, and the waiter says ""oh I didn't see any back there but I'll double check.""  Next time he comes back is maybe 10-15 minutes later and says ""don't want you guys to think I forgot about you but there's no lemons."" Lol I don't know how a full bar + restaurant would be out of lemons...  When he came to pick up our plates we put in an order for a pizookie + a bday pizookie.  Then we waited some more... Another 20+ minutes... And he walks by and is like ""you guys haven't gotten your pizookies yet?"" And then our pizookies came out maybe 5-10 minutes later.  Overall I felt our server was not being genuine and was being really careless. We were at the restaurant over 2 hours because each step took over 30 minutes. Never returning to this location.

I've seen anoyher waitress go to her tables 3-4 times in the hour that we were there, and ours only came by once after taking our orders. Food took so long that we had to request it to be boxed right away because we were out of time (had to go back to work). Her response was that the kitchen was busy because there was a party of 50. Now, that was true, because there was a baby shower going on near us. But when we looked, they were all done eating! I even heard the host thanking her guests for coming and they were passing around the dessert....excuses excuses And i doubt that those people walked in with a party of 50. They prob booked the place well in advance. So that means the restaurant should have made sure there was enough staff on a SATURDAY to accommodate for the regular Sat business and the party of 50. The food in boxes finally came. When we checked, the fries were soggy already...so...the food had been sitting there, just that nobody brought it to us...ahem. My friend ordered no onions for her brisket burger, waitress repeated it back twice. When she got her burger...full of onions, the patty looked like someone took a bite cuz it was small and didn't even fill the burger, brisket off to one side, bacon on the other side....not appetizing. My Santa Fe salad with salmon...salmon tasted great...but where's the avocado? For an $18 salad that listed avocado in the description....I expect avocado. Definitely an off day for BJs...the waitress and the cooking staff.  The restaurant was moderately full, but there were still few empty tables and no wait....so they should be able to do better than that. We did see the manager go to the table next to ours and apologized for something, and offered a free salad or drinks or something. So again...bad day Chino Hills BJs?

This was my first visit to this location after being a regular at the Brea location where the service is better. First off I have to say our Server was very nice and came by often to ask how we were doing once we received our food.  Here are my pros and cons about this place which I visited last night Friday 08/11 Pros:  Friendly Server Friendly Bartenders Decent parking for a Friday evening Air conditioning temp was very cool Cons: Hostess girls in front not to friendly, seem to pre occupied Hostess (s) informed us 25-30 minute wait, it took 45 minutes to be seated Once seated and ordered drinks for party of three it took TEN minutes to get our beverages Tortilla soup was barely warm, almost room temp. I've had much better. Food when brought out by another girl took long, no steak sauce or bbq sauce for ribs I can go on but I won't.... To the Manager...HIRE more Kitchen Staff especially on a busy Friday evening which is a very busy day for eating establishments. Don't pinch pennies, think of the Customers time and happiness while having the Server apologize for LONG waits.

I placed my order and received an email telling me to park in a designated parking for curb side delivery and call the number on the sign so I attempted to do just that. When I got there, there where 3 parking for curb side which were all take with no one in the vehicles. I parked next to those parking spots and tried to call the number, the number said all circuits where busy so i called again, same thing. I got out of my car and walked inside thinking there was something wrong with the phones and that was why the people in the curbside delivery spots where not in their cars; no one was in line at the pick up register or on the phone.

Foodwise, BJ's offers a ridiculous variety.  This is not fine dining, but if you're with a group with diverse tastes, you  can be pretty certain each person will find something suitable on the menu.  They do have a selection of lighter fare for the calorie-conscious, as well, and those items are not lacking in flavor and are also very filling.  Most salads and bowls can also be ordered in a half portion. Kids have a variety of choices here.  Our two typically order buttered noodles with fries, but there is a kids menu available.  They even offer a kid-sized pizookie, which you will feel less guilty about eating. This is a great place for those who enjoy adult beverages, as they have their own brews and also offer signature cocktails.  When it comes to drinks, their berry cider is my favorite.  I also really like their sodas; their homestyle vanilla cream soda is the best I have ever tasted.

Patrick, our waiter, started off the evening nice by taking our order almost immediately. My boyfriend and I ordered avocado egg rolls, the 5 piece ribs, and fish and chips. The first sign of a problem with our order was when they brought out an extra appetizer of avocado egg rolls. We thought they just brought the extra ones to the wrong table and didn't think much else of the situation. (Patrick put in 2 orders of egg rolls instead of egg rolls and my ribs). My boyfriend's food came out, he finished eating, and I still hadn't gotten my food (an hour after he got his food). We aren't the kind of people to make a fuss about something not going our way, but were pretty upset when we told Patrick that I still hadn't gotten my ribs and he nonchalantly replied, ""Oh, I might have forgotten to put those in. Let me check on that. If they're in the back do you want me just to box them for you?"" Umm....what?! He comes back and said, ""Yeah, sorry. That was my fault. I forgot to put those in. Do you want me to put those in now?"" My boyfriend cut in and said we'd just be going. Patrick asked if we'd like to get a dessert. Thanks for the offer? But no! At that point, my boyfriend and I were pretty irritated by the lack of remorse. He didn't even offer to talk to his manager about it. Long(er) story short, we spoke to the manager who probably cared less than Patrick, and we left to get me fast food since it was already almost 9pm and I was, as you can imagine, extremely hungry by this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=100,3.2,3.08,3.076,2.404,3.1280000000000006

My mom ordered a side of chili and fries which they brought out her chili with everyone else's salads for some reason, and then her fries came out with everyone else's entrees.  All of our entrees came out room temperature or cold. A few of us just put up with it because we were starving, but some others sent their food back. One of our guests had a salad that was so drenched and soggy that she couldn't eat it. It seemed like it was made and sat around until all the other food was ready.

A young lady, very polite, seats us after a while.  Our server takes our order pretty quickly, but it takes quite a while to get our order.  We ordered ahi salads -- which took a long time to get -- and a mini pizza that looked and tasted more like bread with cheese on it; it was lukewarm.  I had to ask for napkins.  A very RUDE girl brought out our order to us.  We kept saying thank you and she just stood quiet and was awkward.   If you hate your job, you should quit. Then I notice we did not have forks.  Our server did not bother asking how everything was.  I got his attention to get ""forks, please.""  SERVER:  ""Oh, you need forks?  Okay.  No problem.""  Really?  Of course we need forks. How else would you eat a salad?  I hope it's not a problem either to bring forks.  While we are waiting, we see the rude girl again and ask her if she can check on the forks and told her our server said he would bring them, and her attitude was he will do it.    The salads did not taste like the ones I had before because they were missing cilantro, green onions, red peppers and few other ingredients.  I looked at the menu to verify this, and I was correct.  I told our server, who offered to have new ones made, I said no thank you because we needed to get going soon.  THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN LONG ENOUGH, but I did not want to be rude.  Our server never asked me if we needed refills.  Oh, wait, he did when he gave us the bill.    He took one of the salads off the bill, but that is not what we were looking for.  We came here to eat and expected what we ordered to taste good and to be prepared correctly.  How hard is it to make a salad and the pizza you are known for?  What really got to me was the overall rudeness of the staff.  Our server was polite, but not very good at all.  We had to ask for napkins, silver, and never got a refill or a ""how is everything?""  I am surprised because I have been here when it is busy in the evening and the food is better and servers are way more polite.  Perhaps you need to brush up your daytime crew.  If people take the time to come in to your restaurant and spend their money, you really should not behave like a bunch of rude people who do not want to be bothered.  Without customers, you would not have a job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chino-hills?start=60,2.96,3.18,3.048,,3.0920000000000005
