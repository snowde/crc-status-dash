100,Denver L.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,98,13.0,4.0,2012-02-20,"Craft Beer, Craft Soda's, Deep Dish Pizza, and a piece of heaven called a Pizzokie. Hold on just a second, I'm drooling again. Sunday Beth and I took her nephews to BJ's for there first time. When i lived in OK this was my go to for Tuesday night. Glad to see that this chain doesn't lack in flavor based on locations.  Craft Beer The craft beer selection is very unique, they have a variety from a porter, to a nut brown, traditional wheat, a rye, etc. My favorite is the Nut Brown, a smooth malty beer with a slight roasted grain flavor. Not to hoppy, not to malty, and after a few gives you a case of the grins! I also enjoy the berry cider with desert, a nice sweet cider that compliments very well. Craft Soda's For those of you aren't in the know this place also makes 3 soda's. A root beer, black cherry, and orange creme. The root beer is by far my favorite, this is one of my top 5 places to get a craft root beer in the US. The black cherry is ok, i would wish for a more cola flavor. This could be a competitor for Dr Pepper if they would just listen to me, LOL! The orange creme is not quite a cream siscle flavor but close. This is very nice as a float, HINT HINT. Deep Dish Pizza Let me start off by saying this is not traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. This no way take the place over my beloved Gino's Pizza in Chicago, but its right next to it. I have had every pizza on the menu and so far all i dislike is the sun dried tomatoes on top. After the second pizza I started to remember to ask them to remove them. My favorite is a tie between pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, Or the denver classic pepperoni, pinapple, and jalapeno. Other entree's The appetizers are always nice and fresh, my mom LOVE the seared ahi. they have many choices on the lunch menu that are very reasonable priced. The salad and pizza for under 500 calories is by far a great way to not overfill on lunch. They have have a light menu. The chicken fresca is very nice and light, my favorite is the Tilipia which comes with rice pilaf and salad. Being allergic to olives i leave the tapenade off. Kid's meals One had spaghetti with rice and rootbeer, while the other went for hamburgers with fries and orange juice. Not sure if they were starving, but they have heard me talk about this pizzokie long enough that they devoured there meals fast. The waiter was also very nice and brought there meals out earlier then ours.  Pizzokie So by now if you dont know what this is take a moment to find a seat. Imagine if you will a 4"" or 6"" thin crust pizza pan. Imagine that pan being filled with your choice of cookie dough, chocolate chunk, peanut butter, oreo, red velvet, oatmeal raisin, triple chocolate, or sugar cookie. Imagine that going into a 410 degree oven and cooking till it was just done enough, but still nice and gooey. Imagine 2 scoops of french vanilla being place on top. I guess i now know why the boys ate there meals so fast! My favorite is the oreo, but the both love the chocolate chunk. They have other deserts like an apple berry crumble and a beneight with strawberry topping. But my heart belongs to my oreo or red velvet pizzokie.  Happy Hour they do have a happy hour menu and pricing at the bar. Its generally $1 off beers, but on tuesday its 50% off wine night. Now you know why this was my tuesday :) Parking was easy enough with this location being in a mall, service was fast and friendly. The bartenders are always chatty kathy when you want them to be. Its just a great place to get to hang out and enjoy. And since cincy doesn't have alot of craft brewhouses, this is a go to me for even though its a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cincinnati?start=100,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

We arrived around 120 and the restaurant was semi full with some business lunches and just casual lunches between friends or relatives.   We both decided on a burger and I had the Jalapeno burger with shoestring fries and a nutty brown ale and my friend ordered the BBQ bacon burger with shoestring fries and a seasonal beer. We each requested our burgers medium rare and they came out medium well and the fries were not seasoned.  Service was good, but kind of in a rush as she stated ""My shift is ending now, I have to leave"", but offered us more water before she left.   I had been here before with my dad for lunch and I have ordered a pizza before and it was OK.  It would be awesome if this BJ's location would brew on site instead of ordering it in from the BJ's in Columbus or Cleveland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cincinnati?start=100,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.016000000000001

69,Scott N.,"Hayward, CA",151,436,686.0,2.0,2012-04-06,"I was excited. My sister and brother-in-law were in from Houston. BJ's is a chain. My brother-in-law has eaten at BJ's in Houston, Daytona and Jacksonville, multiple times in each city. They recommending eating at BJ's and I had very high hopes. The beer was good. I like a restaurant that brews their own beer. I don't know that I can say anything better than it was good. It wasn't really memorable. The artichoke spinach dip tasted a bit like paste. It was seriously lacking in flavor. My sister's clam chowder was cold. Stone cold. The waitress said something like, ""I wondered about that"" as if she wasn't surprised it was cold. Hmm.. then why bring it to the table? My brother-in-law loves the original roast beef dip sandwich, so four of them were ordered around the table. Two were sent back because they were.... you guessed it, cold! Sandwiches and fries... cold. Really?  I was asked if my sandwich had caramelized onions on it. All I could say was if it did, I didn't taste them. I hadn't read the menu close enough to remember the sandwich was supposed to have onions. Oh well, by that time it was already gone while two other members of the group waited for theirs to be heated up. So maybe it was an off night... a VERY off night. My sister and brother-in-law have never had a bad experience at a BJ's in other cities Last night was a first. Finally, considering we had to send three items back to be reheated, no mention was made when the bill came. No compensation or acknowledgement. No coupons to come back and try again. No discounts. Sorry, when food needs to be sent back, something should be done to make amends.  The menu is HUGE, so I'd say it's worth another try, but it's not at the top of my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cincinnati?start=40,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

We had the distinct misfortune of staying at the crappiest hotel in the area (The Atrium, in case you were wondering) during our first trip to Cininnati and Dave turned our view of the city right around with his positive attitude and willingness to tell us about all of the great things in his hometown. We also traded tips on beer and experienced some great local flavor. The food was delicious too, but Dave really made the experience.

The name (whether sophomoric or just ill-advised), mall location and novella size of the menu all scored no points with me. But the beer options are terrific, not just the house brands (the kolsch was very impressive; the porter more like a cream stout which is not my thing) but also a great selection of other craft brews and imports on draft. And the menu doesn't just offer greasy bar chow or rehash tired, mediocre dishes as so many mid-priced chains do. It also offers a lot of variety, including a very large section of healthy fare, and everything we had was well executed.

The beer is pretty good as well.  I think the price of a pint can be on the higher side, so I was happy to see a happy hour special mentioned online.  However when we sat in the restaurant section, they informed us that the happy hour typically only applies when sitting in the bar area, but they would be willing to give us the discount this time.  Oh thank you so very much, I can't believe how gracious you are to give me the happy hour that is advertised for your restaurant, especially when I'm going to be giving you more money by ordering full meals rather than just drinking at the bar.  I've been to a few places that pull this stunt and it irritates me every time. Also, they recently introduced their new ""Premier Rewards"" program.  I was intrigued and signed up to get the points for that visit.  In yet another move to defy logic, BJ's Restaurant & BREWHOUSE only provides you with reward points on food purchases, NOT for beer (even if you order both).  For a restaurant that sets itself apart for brewing its own beer, you'd think they'd include that in their rewards program.  Not the end of the world, but again, irritating.   Overall, I'll be back, though it isn't top on my list.  But I do like the beer and food.  And should the ""restaurant"" refuse the happy hour price next time, I'll just walk the few paces over to a bar table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cincinnati?start=80,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.1800000000000006,3.5200000000000005

62,Tabitha W.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,401,960.0,3.0,2013-08-27,"This meal started out pleasantly enough - we had Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms from their Snacks & Small Bites Menu. For our entree we decided to go with a Signature Deep Dish Pizza. When the pizza arrived, we seriously asked the waitress if this was the deep dish - we thought maybe they'd given us hand-tossed by mistake?  When I hear 'deep dish', I think Chicago-style, a la Giordanos. I'm talkin' serious cheese, flavorful sauce, and a hefty pie that's just brimming with toppings. The cheese here was sparse, the overall pizza was flat and disappointing, and there was hardly any sauce.  I ended up asking for a cup of sauce on the side so it wasn't like I was just eating bread.   To be fair, this is how BJ's describes their Signature Deep Dish, ""A culinary masterpiece - pairing our flavorful, lightly sauced bakery crust pizza with BJ's signature blend of five cheeses and unique combinations of toppings and flavors to inspire all of your senses."" I don't know - the lightly-sauced part was accurate, but I still was expecting more. So, it's not meant to be Chicago-style, but it was just way too bread-y for my tastes and I needed more sauce, more cheese, more flavor.      Despite the overall disappointing pizza experience, I very much enjoyed the small bites.

When I get a bleu cheese burger, I want it smothered with bleu cheese. Anyway, you don't go here for the food, you go here for the beer! So I sampled all of BJ's own beer styles except the light beer. Because you gives a shit about the taste of light beer anyway, am I right? What I found is this. All of their styles are good but aren't as good as other breweries versions of the style. Except for 1 case. The ""BJ Brewhouse PM Porter"" was fantastic. I give that beer alone 5 stars. Its an exceptional porter. So, in conclusion, go there and its fine. Especially after a movie. But if you don't know what beer to get, I recommend a million times over, the PM Porter.

The service ranges from good to outstanding, with a couple of servers starting out super-attentive and sort of fizzling out at the end when it came to refills and the check. That being said, I am frequently the chick being a total pain in the ass with special diet and substitution requests and I chug diet Coke like I've been doing calisthenics in the Sahara, so it's not entirely their fault. Last Sunday our server Salvador was way above par, never letting our drinks dip below 3/4 full and handling the aforementioned ass-pain with friendliness, efficiency and accuracy.  Definitely one of the best servers the beau and I have ever had. BJ's also makes a great date night spot, especially if, like me, you're consistently low on funds because you don't budget well.

37,Macy M.,"Franklin, TN",33,60,233.0,4.0,2015-04-12,"Stopped in here on the way to Ikea. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. This is a great place for groups, as there is plenty of space. The menu is extensive (appetizers, salads, speciality pizzas, burgers, entrees, light menu, etc). They also have a separate lunch menu (M-F) with great prices. They also brew their own beer and have many unique cocktail choices. My boyfriend tried the new Committed IPA and really enjoyed it!  We started off with the corn fritters. Great appetizer and only $3.50! It's a nice starter and enough to share without being too filing. They are soft on the inside and nice and crisp on the outside. They have a good amount of heat from jalapeños and are served with a creamy sauce and corn, bacon and green onions on the plate.  I had the honey crisp chicken salad with blackened chicken instead of chicken tenders. Nice light salad! The salad dressings are good, and they have a good variety. The blackened chicken has a nice spice.  My boyfriend had the crispy jalapeño burger.  It was served on a grilled bun, which is always a plus! The jalapeños were nicely fried and topped with a creamy sauce with a nice kick. Overall, good burger. The fries and wedges are great too! (He did 1/2 and 1/2.)  For dessert, they're known for their pizookies (deep dish cookies). We didn't try one here, but I've had them at another location, and they're amazing! You can even do a sampler trio.

My husband was never offered a refill even though his drink was empty before he finished his meal. She seemed a bit more personable with the tables around is. Not sure if something about us offended her, if it was because I suggested my husband have his burger cooked to medium instead of mid rare or because we didn't order alcohol.

If I was there for a typical dinner, the noise level would have stressed me out. Along with the 2 kids that were running around (nice parenting). Our server was awesome - he was always on top of things! We got chips and queso  (with the pale ale chili) - it was really frackin' good. Super cheesy and the chili swirled in nicely. My husband got the pig Flatbread (something like that!). He really enjoyed it. I got fish'n'chips - the fish was awesome. Light but crunchy breading. Loved the smaller pieces too. Fries weren't very good but my husband had no issues finishing them off. And because we starved ourselves all day, we got the Pizookie trio - peanut butter, cookies and cream and chocolate chunk.

Sadly, I'm not of age to drink so I couldn't take part, but it was still pretty to look at. The host when I came in ( 8:30 on a Friday) was super nice and told us our wait would be 15 minutes. It ended up only being 10. When we were escorted to our seat we sat there for about 8 minutes until we had a server approach us. I could tell our waitress was busy so it wasn't anything to complain about. The sad thing was that she was very inattentive. She checked in with us about 3 times. Once to get our drinks, once to get our order, and once to bring out our checks. When I go out I expect to have polite conversation, and have a connection with my waitress. We were there for an hour and fifteen minutes, I expected to be checked on 4 or 5 times.  Now for my thoughts of the food: We got the mozzarella sticks for the app, and it was average. The marinara sauce was bland but when you order mozzarella sticks you can't expect a 5 star experience. My entree was the Bacon Guacamole burger. First off the guac was pretty good. And I know good guac ( I work at a chipotle ;)). The burger wasn't anything exceptional. It tasted like a Jack Daniels burger but with a lot less flavor. Also? It wasn't hot. Like it was kinda luke-warm but not hot.  For dessert we got the Pazooki and it was by far the best thing we are all night. It's a cookie in a cake tin covered in Ice Cream.

Delicious and a bargain at $4 (happy hour?).     My friends arrived and we were promptly seated. The well versed waiter handed us menus that were the thickness of a Harry Potter book. I'm always suspicious of a 12 page menu. Keep it basic I thought. Ben and I had burgers , Lindsay had deep dish pizza. My burger was ok. I found the meat oddly seasoned. The deep dish pizza looked very doughy and crust heavy, sauce and toppings on the light side. We concurred the food was serviceable, but overpriced for sure.

The waitress never let my water reach below half empty, I was impressed. It was busy but not crazy. We had our food within 15 minutes.  The menu is extensive, maybe even almost to big. They offer a wide variety of cuisine. Everything from Mexican to Italian. I decided to go with the Maui Maui tacos off of the lunch menu. They were great! Very filling and light, so I didn't feel awful afterwords.  All in all I would recommend this restaurant for a work related lunch or a date night dinner.

At some point the waitress notices and says that a manager is working to get the food ready (We saw him walking around instead, actually). My burger came out lukewarm. We definitely got the vibe that they forgot an order. The manager brings out the food and doesn't mention anything about the wait or about why he was supposedly preparing the food.

Had a sampler of their stout, porter, red and lager and all were very very good. My grandma has the mahi mahi and shrimp in a creole sauce. She loved it, and I thought it was tasty. I had the southern comfort crispy chicken sandwich with ham. I have to say I was disappointed. The chicken was small on an oversized bun which means most of your bites are a lot of bread. Is was advertised to have creamy Alfredo sauce and Dijon mayonnaise with bacon. Bacon was under cooked. Barely any Alfredo sauce. I thought it would be dripping off the sides similar to a good barbecue sauce sandwich. Nope. I think it was wiped on the bun like a condiment. Not impressed. Didn't eat it. Mgr took it off the bill. Other issues that kept me from giving more than a 3 star include my first menu has some nasty spaghetti sauce inside the 3rd-4th page. Gross! Had to ask for another menu and go wash my hands.

It was tasty but some of the artichokes had that chewy outer layer which is not a good texture in a dip. I had a chicken entree that was low calorie but high in flavor. It included brussell sprouts which I love but can't find very often at restaurants. My husband had ribs that were tender and well seasoned. The macaroni and cheese was made with quinoa and was delicious and creamy. Priscilla inquired about drinks when our glasses were low which meant we didn't have to interrupt our meal to flag her down.  Dessert was a Carmel sea salt cookie covered in ice cream...also yummy.

Service: hit or miss, today our server was actually fantastic - they use a point of sale ipad type input device at table side so they can readily deal with all the adjustments to meals that my and my family make.  However, I have certainly had times with mediocre service. Food: watermelon and feta salad is perfect in the summer, burgers are fine however my burger i ordered at medium today was definitely under.  Pizza's are fine however in comparison I think dewey's / pies and pints do a better job of the pizza and beer combo and mad tree does a far better job.  Pizookie cookie desserts are delicious but also approx 8 billion calories per.  The jambalaya is undoubtedly my favorite and a winner Beer: for commercial brewery/chain brewery actually pretty solid - I'll admit I tend to stick to the ambers and wheats - not a big IPA fan.  Overall pretty nice selection  Price is reasonable, and it serves the purpose for me - a nice sunday spot where my family can feel like they are getting a decent post church lunch while I mindlessly say yes to whatever conversation is going on so I can watch the bengals game",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cincinnati,3.32,3.58,3.58,,3.4760000000000004
