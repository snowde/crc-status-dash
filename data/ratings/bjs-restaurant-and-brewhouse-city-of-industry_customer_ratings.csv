292,Mantis T.,"Goodyear, AZ",12,16,10.0,1.0,2012-01-10,"*** Just the facts here *** The service I've received was horrible! It was all thanks to our server Bruce. I decided to eat here with my wife on my lunch break. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food around 12:15ish. Our food ( 2 orders of chicken quesadillas ) was served to us at 12:42pm ( A lengthy wait, did they have to kill the chicken?). Our server Bruce only came to our table twice, 1st time to take our order & the 2nd time to give our check ( we had to flag him down to get the check ). Not once did Bruce come to our table or pass by to check up on, he didn't even refill our drinks ( Big taboo for me )! The only employees around us were the bus boys who tried hard not to make eye contact with us. I had to get back to work and we left the establishment at 1:03pm with no tip for our server Bruce.  I called the establishment around 3:30pm later in the day and spoke with the manager Tommy. I asked him about the restaurants soda refill policy and he told me that ""it was unlimited refills"". Then, I told Tommy my experience at his restaurant earlier in the day with his employee Bruce and his ignorance to the restaurants ""unlimited soda refill policy"". Tommy apologized for the poor service that Bruce had given me. I told Tommy; ""I understand that it was busy during lunch but this was the worst service I've had at your restaurant"". Tommy immediately replied; ""We weren't busy at all during lunch today and I apologize again"". With Tommy stating that it wasn't busy during lunch, it solidified my decision to give this establishment 1star. The taste of the food would've bumped the rating to 2 stars but with the poor service any food would leave a foul taste in your mouth. So a message to you Bruce: FUCK YOU!!! God gave you 2 perfectly working legs, so use them properly to do your job you lazy bastard!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=320,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.02,2.96
356,Robert M.,"Chino, CA",65,285,2.0,4.0,2012-01-12,"BJ's is a BJ's is a BJ's, right? Well, sort of. But I do really like the design of the bar here. It doesn't seem to be a crowded BJ's; Sunday playoff games last weekend did not bring many sports fans, at least. They have a nice array of guest taps; not always the case at BJ's. Since   they centralized brewing and one can't get much in the way of variety or experimentation other than a regular seasonal any longer, it's nice to have a choice of Green Flash or Lost Abbey and some other good ones.  The service on the few occasions that I've visited has been cordial and effective. I also appreciate its proximity to Costco, making the up-to-2-hour wait for a tire rotation less painful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=360,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.384,2.96

291,Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,375,844.0,3.0,2012-02-15,"The only variance between this BJ's as opposed to all the others is its service and location. Prices are the same, ambience is the same, food is the same (mediocre at best with the exception of their infamous pizookies). With that said, BJ's is a nice place to chill for lunch and after work. I came here with my coworker for a late dinner, and we were seated right away by a tired (??) waitress who seemed to have no energy at all other than to just ask how many and if we'd like to sit at the bar. Quick run-down?  Location: Awkward. Not much parking space. I could imagine it getting packed and for it to be a nightmare to try to find parking during peak hours. Atmosphere: Relaxing, cushion-y booths, dim. Separated from the bar.  Food/Price: Very huge menu of food. Extensive menu of alcohol. Decent prices. I had 2 appetizers and a pizookie while my coworker had himself a pizza with a beer. Price came out to be under $40. I had the red velvet pizookie for the first time, and it was...interestingly sweet; the ice cream was undeniably delicious though. Small Cesar salad was a-okay. But there's usually nothing special about salads anywhere anyway. Service: Our waiter liked to socialize, and there's nothing I enjoy more than late night small talk. The only problem was that when he brought me my chicken lettuce wrap, all that came out was the lettuce, dips, and carrots. Was I just supposed to eat the lettuce with carrots and dip 'em in the sauce? I'm not a bunny. My coworker asked him for it, and he seemed genuinely sorry that he didn't notice it earlier. We left close to 1AM which was their closing time, although they did drop off the bill maybe 40 minutes (during our meal) before. I hate being rushed to leave, but I really liked our server so I tipped him a little over $12 (yeah, he was that nice!). Overall, 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=320,2.92,3.2,3.2,2.444,3.0880000000000005

In one of the first occasions that we had placed an order, they didn't provide me with the bbq dressing for our bbq chicken salad and our pizza was incorrect. This wasn't the first time that they had forgotten something out of our order so I had asked them to please double check and make sure that everything was in there, since they kept getting the orders wrong. Sadly I showed up back to my work place with no bbq sauce/dressing for the salad (which was the most expensive thing in our order), semi cold pizzas and no utensils for our lunch. I decided to call since this wasn't the first time and inform them that the dressing wasn't included and make them aware to double check their orders. Who I spoke too claimed to have been the manager and actually had the decency to ask me to drive back to pick up the dressing?!!! REALLY??!! CMON! This should have been taken care of  the first time before I left and you asking me to go back to pick it up was rude. She then offered to send me some gift card to compensate for the dressing. No one at work ate the salad since its not that great missing the dressing. We never received the gift cards either. I then proceeded to write a letter to corporate about their customer service and I sadly never heard back from them. I was disappointed that they do not double check their orders. I would recommend anyone that picks up lunch here to check their orders before leaving the restaurant or they will ask you to come back to fix it. The good thing is that they do have other things other than their over doughy pizzas. Sadly when I think of BJs I think of pazookies and pizza and their pizzas are sooo not recommended from here. We've ordered a variety of them but for some reason they aren't that good, at least not to go. We also stopped ordering the bbq chicken cobb salad and stuck to the regular BJs cobb. We do not order the pizzas any more and we stick to their sandwiches which to my surprise have always been well prepared and don't lack on flavor or ingredients. They all have been satisfying and good enough to keep us coming back ordering the a la carte style. As for customer service, I do not pick up the orders anymore, I just place them over the phone and so far at least over the phone, they have been friendlier and more helpful (their party platters changed recently and the lady that helped me over the phone was really helpful and especially really patient). Bjs cobb salad is good. As for my favorite sandwich so far from them I would say the roasted turkey cobb.

In my opinion, the food doesnt live up to its expectations, and I do not have a reason to go back again.  Today I had dinner with my boyfriend, Tuesday night at around 6:30, and there was no wait. We were quickly seated to our cute two person seat. Right next to us, there was a ""bachelorette"" party going on. A dinner of about 15 ladies in their 20's. They were crazy. And throughout my dinner, they were driving me nuts. Why doesn't BJ's have a special room for them? I'm trying to have a nice dinner myself, I do not appreciate the loud drunk ladies throwing a semi party.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and the BBQ chicken pizza. But guess what. They gave us the wrong pizza. Our waitress was very.. kurt. No words really. Short answers. And obviously did not hear our order correctly. We were hungry, so we dug in. The egg rolls were dry, stuffed with avocado, and nothing else. What about some carrots, onions, some seasoning? Nothing. Very disappointed appetizer. These egg rolls are much better at California Pizza Kitchen. The pizza, was also very disappointing. Instead of the BBQ we ordered, we were given Buffalo something... and it tasted weird. Awkward, as if I was eating buffalo wings on my pizza. Not very good at all. I was a little disgusted with the food to even get dessert, a pizookie. Which was the main reason I wanted BJ's tonight.  We ended up paying very little tip for the poor service, and incorrect order of pizza.  I still have never tried a pizookie. But even then, I will try the dessert and only the dessert.

Anyways, at the end we get our bill and notice we were charged for extra stuff (which happens) so the manager fixes it and says ""OK, this is your new total,"" So everyone pays and once we have the amount they all start leaving since their parents were there to pick them up. Now It's just a few of us left and the manager comes back and says ""Oh! sorry I forgot to add tax and tip."" Uh....everyone is already gone and he said ""this is your new total."" It's not our fault he messed up. Finally we had enough and my friend let's him know it. She wasn't going to bring up the rude waitress but we had enough.

Our waitress was only waiting on two tables but we were there for over 2 hours. It took a little over a half hour for our orders to be taken, about the same time to get our food, then what seemed like FOREVER to get our bill which we only got because someone had to get up and find our waitress and ask her after we waited for about 45 minutes AFTER we finished eating and plates were already collected.

If you have limited time to eat your food and need to head to the office, either get your food to-go or go somewhere else.

My coworkers and I used to come here for happy hour from time to time, until about a month ago when the manager told us we were cut off after TWO pitchers of beer between EIGHT people in the timespan of over two hours. For being too loud. NEWSFLASH: it's the bar area, people are talking, people are watching sports, it's gonna be loud, PERIOD. We're a large party talking in a noisy-ass room, we have to raise our voices just to be heard by the person sitting across from us. So chalk it up to one bad manager with a stick up his ass. Returned last night to the BITCHIEST waitress I've ever had the displeasure of encountering. I arrived after the other four members of our party. We asked for another plate because the table had been set for four, silverware because there was NONE,  some napkins because we hadn't been provided silverware so no cloth napkins (such simple logic), and a glass of water. This waitress had the audacity to roll her eyes at us and say with not a small amount of attitude, ""Is there ANYTHING ELSE I can get for you?"" I'm sorry we're a party of chatty Asians asking you for things you should have already provided us (or at the very least not have been surprised to be asked for), blondie.  No need to get all uppity. I wouldn't be surprised if she spat into the water, that's how venomous her attitude was. Doing things like sighing so hard I could see her doing it whenever she approached our table. The worst service I've ever experienced from any BJs. In fact, one of the best servers I've ever had there, consistently, was a waitress who looked really high. I don't want to say she definitely was, because hey, maybe homegirl has red eyes from allergies (on at least 2-3 separate occasions...), but if she WAS, maybe the other wait staff should follow her example so they can CHILL THE F OUT. Also the food is super greasy and the pizza toppings aren't fresh.

The first sign that we may have made a bad call was when we gave our name to the servers for a 10-minute wait... and after seeing everyone else's names called that were after us, we asked to see if we'd been skipped.  Their response: ""Oh, we called your name sometime ago.""  Um, we were in the lobby next to the desk - we WOULD have heard it. The second bad sign was with my order.  While Kathy's California Burger and my Jalapeno Burger turned out ok (along with the fried artichoke hearts), I had asked for the skinny fries - and I got the potato wedges instead.   Don't get me wrong - the burgers were very filling (if not overpriced).  But while your orders come out quickly, the service at BJs leaves much to be desired.  In fact, one could say that we didn't get a happy ending from this BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=140,2.96,2.89,2.89,2.9840000000000004,2.918

Ordered a pitcher of their phiranna, shrimp pasta, mozzarella sticks, and a Pizza. I've had the phiranna at brea and it was amazing. At this location it tasted completely different. Super bitter and it didn't have that sweet after taste it usually does.  Food took about half an hour to come out. For being so empty I figured it'd come out alot quicker. Waitress was too busy chatting up with her friends in the table behind ours. By the time the food came out it was cold. The pizza was cold, pasta had cold spots, and we never even got our mozerlla sticks. Whats the point of ordering an appetizer and get it as desert? We ended up cancelling it.  This is the only time I've ever not left a tip. Maybe the food taking forever wasn't our waitresses fault but she sure as hell didnt do anything about it since she was too busy conversating.

I'd never been to BJ's but my fiancé has and gave it rave reviews so I wanted to try it out. Total flop! They told us it was a 10 minute wait to be seated. For a Friday night, it wasn't that busy so I just assumed they were short staffed. We decided to have a seat at the bar and prime the ol' pump. I ordered a Modelo and my better half ordered a michelada. Now, a michelada is half beer, half spicy clamado then done. It was horrible. Too much spice, too little tomato juice. Ordinarily I don't bitch about drinks in reviews but for $9 for something I can make at home for far less, I have certain expectations. They weren't met. So, we continued waiting for a table. After 15 minutes, I went over and asked the host if our table was ready and she said yeah, we called you. Oh really? How? Did you send out carry pigeons and we happened to miss them? Didn't hear our names shouted, they didn't give us a buzzer thing, nothing. So we finally get seated. We sat there, decided what we wanted and then waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for a server to show up, all the while, numerous servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. So Michael finally came by, didn't offer us water, took our order and disappeared. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and Buffalo style chicken wontons, and the chicken bacon ranch pizza. 20 minutes later, a different server brings our pizza to the table and asked if it was ours. We said yeah, but we want our appetizers first (DUH!) so she offers to take it and put it in the warmer for us. Literally a second after she leaves, a THIRD server brings our apps. Both tasted fine but were lukewarm. What the hell is going on around here!? Michael then asks if he can bring our pizza back, we say yeah. The pizza was good but lacked the right amount of ranch to balance it with the bacon and chicken. Overall, the food was better than average. But for the cost, it should have been really GOOD.

There's nothing spectacular about the place but the food is consistently 4 stars. This location is one of 4-5 that I've visited and its my least favorite so far. I had a case of bad luck when it came to my servers. Yes servers with an ""S"". Over the course of 2 hours I had four, yes four different servers. It was really annoying bcuz I had to repeat everything several times to several different people. I was rushed the entire time. I was there on a Sunday evening so they might have been under staffed but the rushed feeling isn't a good one for me.

I had the Italian Chicken Parmesan this time and the Spinach Artichoke dip for an appetizer. Both were perfectly high in calories and finger lickin' good. No complaints there!! Actually I lied...I do have one small complaint. My friend ordered the fried wontons as a starter....what a joke. 3 little tiny fried things with almost nothing in them. Stay away from the wontons.

We usually go to the Chino Hills or Brea locations but were at the Puente Hills location last night. The night started out a little roughly - my beer took a very long time to come and my fork was dirty (looked like someone already ate a pizookie with it) but it was nothing worth complaining about. However, when our food came my mom's Mahi Mahi was so overcooked that the edges were burnt. She gets this every time we go and knew that it isn't usually cooked like that so she sent it back to be remade. Then our friends started eating their pizza only to find that they forgot to put sauce on it. When the waiter returned with the new fish, we saw that it was once again burned on the edges and overcooked. We asked to speak to the manager about our food so he brought him over. We informed the manager of the fish and the pizza. He offered to bring out a new pizza but since they were hungry they said it wasn't necessary, but if he could just bring them a side of sauce. He told us he would personally go get the sauce and NEVER CAME BACK. My mom did not eat the fish, they left the rest of the pizza and at the end of the meal the manager brought us our check with a 20 dollar comp card ""to be used at our next visit"", said nothing about the sauce he never brought, and didn't even ask how the rest of our meal was. He seemed eager to drop the bill and leave. When we looked at it we saw that he charged us for the fish and the pizza anyway. We told our server that he never even brought sauce and we didn't eat the fish and he was understanding and said he would take the bill to the manager to be fixed. When the waiter finally returned nothing about the bill changed and he just apologized again about the food. We put the 20 dollar comp card in the bill and told him to use it now because we would not be returning. The manager never returned to our table and said nothing to us when we passed him on our way out. We are not usually the type to complain, but I asked our waiter to inform the manager that I would be complaining about him specifically because his managing skills were awful and he did nothing to redeem a very disappointing experience. We are always happy with our visits to the Chino Hills and Brea locations but because of that manager we will not be returning to this location and we will advise other friends and family against it as well.

I recommend the flatbread and the bruschetta. They are very lite and refreshing, not too heavy so you can still get your buzz on. They have $4 beer and $6 wines which include La Creama Pinot Noir, one of my go to wines.  Sports are always on and on huge TVs over the bar.

Good place to get a drink as they have many varieties of beer, but I am no drinker. Food was alright, nothing special. I ordered the California burger cooked medium with a side of wedge-cut seasoned fries. Burger arrived more of a medium-well and the fries were on the well-done side. The burger itself wasn't bad with the included toppings. Service was above average as the waitress came around twice to fill our drinks and brought out lemon wedges for our water when asked.

100,Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",1021,358,4410.0,5.0,2014-03-30,"My boyfriend and I came here on a late Sunday night because we were both hungry and wanted something different from what we would normally eat. We waited in the front for a few minutes until someone finally tended to us and seated us.  Kayla was our server for the night and she was amazing. I've been to BJ's a few times before at different locations, and I've received good and bad service. But Kayla was refreshing to have; she was very sweet and attentive to us. She gave us recommendations, and told us about the specials the restaurant was having. My boyfriend decided on getting: Ahi Poke appetizer - $10.25 Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza - $15.25 Seared Ahi Salad - $14.95 No joke, our meal was huge. I really love how decadent and comforting their pizza is, so I only order pizza whenever I come here. I ordered the small so I could bring back left overs for my brother to eat, and have some for lunch the next day. My boyfriend has been hooked on Ahi Tuna for the past few months, so that's a perk for me too since I also like Tuna.  The Ahi Poke ($10.25) was good; poke tasted freshly tossed and didn't seem like it was sitting in the marinade for too long. The avocado chunks were huge, and they were the big haas avocados, so they tastes very rich and a perfect balance to the smooth texture of the tuna. It wasn't any special sashimi grade, considering that it's BJ's, but it was good. It was a pretty good portion of tuna, and it came with a side of 8 won ton chips.  The Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza ($15.25) was pretty good. I usually just get the combo, but the garlic was definitely savory. I was just expecting garlic seasoning on the pizza, but I saw some chunks integrated into the alfredo sauce in the pizza, so that was awesome. The toppings to pizza dough ratio wasn't well balanced in my personal opinion, but because the crust was sooo unbelievably buttery and flakey, I won't complain. I got more full from the dough itself than the overall meal. I ate about 2 slices and got full. My boyfriend really liked their alfredo sauce, so another perk! The Seared Ahi Salad ($14.95) was such a huge portion! It looked as if it as easily 2 salads in one. Personally, I'm too cheap to be spending $15 on a salad from BJ's, at that rate I would have just ordered a pizza. The seared ahi was just okay in my opinion. The texture itself was a bit mushy, so it wasn't as fresh as the poke earlier, but the overall dish was good. The dressing was delicious, however the salad itself was overdressed. The avocados, greens, and overall flavors were very generous and my boyfriend and I thought we could've just shared the salad and an appetizer and we would have been full already! We also signed up for their rewards programs, and I guess once you sign up it includes a free pizookie? This was actually the first time I went to BJ's and didn't get a pizookie because we were so full from the salad! I guess we'll save the freebie for another time :) Overall, we both had a great time at Bj's, and we left with way more food than we intended to. Kayla, you were great! She made us feel very welcomed, and our glasses were never left half empty.  We will definitely be back at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=120,3.2,3.21,3.21,2.868,3.206

They've also lost plenty of their loyal customers last night.  We called ahead to book a reservation for a graduation party since our party was more than 7 . The hostess would not let us book an appointment simply because she said there wouldn't be a wait. That's not the point a reservation. It's supposed to give the kitchen and staff the heads up that there's a big party coming in. We waited more than an hour for our food while others around us who came half an hour after us, got their food. Half of the people at our table receieved ice cold pasta and mine was missing meatballs.  Take 2: 30 minutes later the pasta was hot, but my meatballs were cold and mostly fillings. I asked for meatsauce but I got marinara.  One star for the manager stepping up and apologizing without giving excuses or blaming others. Also, he took off 50% of our total bill since he saw how upset we all were ( we even turned down free soup,  salad, and dessert). We just wanted to go home after 3 hours of chaos.

Maybe I'm just not a fan in general of deep dish unless it's the kind of deep dish they serve in Chicago Fire in downtown Sacramento. I was very disappointed with BJ's Ahi Poke appetizer. Just didn't taste right at all. I should have given it back, but didn't think to. The wonton chips were perfectly fine. However the tuna was just really sad. Tasted like they just mixed some green onions, d-grade diced tuna sashimi, and tossed it around in some bland soy sauce, then topped it over a bed of finely chopped cabbage with sesame seeds. By far the worst Ahi Poke I've ever had. You would think that if a chain restaurant offered something like this, they would make it an appealing item to order. However, it tasted like this dish was a complete afterthought. Just seemed like there were so many missing ingredients. Even my friend was disgusted by this dish.

This is a place my dad likes and the only time I've been is when my dad and grandma want to eat out.  Generally-speaking, the service is pretty good. The food is ok. The Scallop entree, even with no sauces and no butter whatsoever was pretty good.  For me, the downside is a huge restaurant filled with people, loads of kids and huge families, which can translate into a loud and chaotic-feeling dining experience.

The server wiped it down so no problem.  Ordered our drinks... Took at least ten minutes to get them.   Ordered our food when the drinks came cause I was afraid I wouldn't see my server again for a lengthy time.  I ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi. Then came the wait. About 30-35 min later our food arrived and our server was running around, we hadn't seen him since we ordered our food.  The mahi mahi was dry and a little burned on top. I'm sure that's why I waited so long for my food, cause it was drying out from being overcooked.  Would I order this again? No. Could service had been better? Our server Alex could have come by earlier to at least give us a status of our food.  The only saving grace was when our server went on break and was relieved by James. He made sure to check on us and get us refills and just ask ""if everything was OK"" when he did actually ask us, I wasn't in the mood to bring up the fact that my mahi mahi was dry and overcooked.  Long story short, don't come here if starving and you don't mind waiting for your food for a long while.

It was a Saturday night, it was quite busy but we noticed that there was nobody sitting in the outdoor area. We asked if we could go sit there because it was too cold inside and they accommodated us quickly.  Too start off, I ordered a cocktail that was created at one of their other restaurants called ""A drink like that"" which consisted of Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151, Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Blue, Sweet & Sour, Sierra Mist,  and Grenadine. After perusing through the menu we decided to order the appetizer Avocado eggs rolls and a deep dish BBQ pizza to share. The eggs rolls came out quick and were very delicious. Nice and crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside as you would expect it. I can see myself just ordering this and be satisfied.  The pizza was also delicious and very filling, we could not finish it. The server was very nice and friendly, though since we sat outside the service was kind of slow since there was no dedicated server to check up on us.

The wings were soggy, and for being ""XXX"" hot, barely had any flavor, in addition to being lukewarm.  i would venture to call the wings gross even.   And finally, the pizookies were tasty, but again it was evident that they were sitting out for a bit as the ice cream was runny and some serious ice runoff had begun.  The server gave the excuse that she saw the pizookies but wasn't notified to pick them up (whatever that means).   In any case, the poor service here is a sign of some serious management flaws.   Get your act together, BJs of Rowland Heights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=200,2.44,2.96,3.0,2.02,2.7520000000000002

113,May L.,"Pasadena, CA",50,93,14.0,1.0,2015-12-22,"My first server stepped out of the segregated south and treated us like second-class citizens. It wasn't busy and waiting ten minutes to be acknowledged seemed like an eternity. When he finally came to our table, he glared (yes! Death stare style) at us, without any glimmer of smile, introductions, apology for the delay and took our order in the most condescending tone. If we were out on the streets, a beat down would've ensued. That's the vibe we got at our table. Scary! Management finally sent me a new server. She was friendly but her runner nearly threw our plates down.  Wow! Their tantrums are far better than my kids' soap opera rage. Five stars for novella-show quality attitudes...In the service industry, it's an epic fail!  Management didn't offer any concessions when the bill came. Even complimentary iced teas on a $100 bill for lunch would've shown good faith.  Service should've been done right the first time. Considering the surreal nature of the poor service, it's a negative 5 stars. Manager switched our server, who turns out friendly. 4 stars. Average the two: 1 star  Although smart establishments would go out of their way to ""take care"" of their customers, lack of concessions are not within norm of any dining experience. If it is part of a restaurant grade, this review would downgrade to a negative star rating. The food was mediocre, at best. My favorite item is discontinued: basil tomato pasta. The calamari was skimpy and the rib eye was charred on the outside. Real chefs know the difference between burning the outside of a steak versus properly searing it. You can tell it didn't rest in room temperature and was thrown on the grill half frozen. The rice pilaf was still hard and 1/2 cooked. My soup arrived lukewarm. The burgers were haphazardly stacked together and the patty was not seasoned at all. That's a sign of complacent standards in the kitchen. Taste in my mouth: meh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=120,2.4,2.81,2.964,1.988,2.646

Restaurant not even full, our server takes about 7 mins to greet us. Once she gets to us we are all ready with our order so that she didn't have to get the run around. Well here's when the sh** show starts. The food runner who drops off my beer places my beer at the edge of the table then decides to go grab coasters and literally throw them on our table, not place them he stood 2 feet from my table and threw them. I wanted to get up and tell that guy with the beard off so bad because that was simply rude. Then when it the food is finally up, my partner starts to roll up his noodles and a piece of plastic comes from within the dish. DISGUSTING!!! Now for the best part once we told our server that we wanted it remade, she stops and makes a face as if it was an issue. I didn't know your job of taking orders was so hard.

I decided to take them here...  Our server was wonderful, however, the reason for my single star review is for the boy that brought our food.  When I placed our order I specifically asked for ranch on my salad, and EXTRA ranch ON THE SIDE.  When the kid brought out the two plates, I immediately noticed there was NO ranch on the salad, he seemed as if he was in a hurry so I informed him that there was no ranch on the salad and that I had asked for ranch and ranch on the side. He looks to me and says, ""Yea, well I only have two hands"" then walks away, I was in disbelief in his response that all I could say was ""OH"" as he walked away after just having processed his response, I was pissed because my parents noticed how rude he was, my father blamed his age and told me not to make a big deal out of it, but I just cant!!!  He had to be handled, his age is no excuse for his behavior.  He brought A SINGLE RANCH with his TWO hands, didn't say a word, set it on the table and left. I wanted to say so badly, ""YOU HAVE TWO HANDS BUT BROUGHT OUT ONE RANCH?!"" But my parents were present so I had to maintain my good girl behavior.  Shortly, after that, I walked straight up to the receptionist and asked to speak to a manager. I waited there for a good while, manager was a no show. The girl finally came back out and told me that I could sit back down and the manager will walk over to our table. twenty minutes finally pass, our food came out, manager finally arrived and listened to what I had to say, she seemed as if she sympathized, but I doubt it. I've been a manager in customer service work for years and I know that customer service is critical in a striving business, I understand that a customer's satisfaction should be the utmost priority, she did not attempt to make us happy, NOT that I was expecting anything for free. But she could have at LEAST asked if she could bring us anything.  ten minutes passed and the kid comes back to the table he tells me that his manager told him that he was being rude to us, he looked at me and I straight up said the same thing I told his manager.  His response: ""yeah Im just tired I guess""  Uhh, really? I'm a full time student AND work 12-13 hour days the days I don't have school--so, being tired is NO EXCUSE!  Might I add, he was walking away while I was still talking to him, so I guess he is just a tired incompetent kid.

We got seated at about 7:11 and we ordered our food shortly after. Our first server Steve went on break and our next server Kenny took over and introduced himself. We waited for about 20 minutes and our server came and told us that our food would be out soon. However, time continued to pass by and 10 minutes later he came again to tell us our food would be arriving soon. ANOTHER 10 minutes passed by and my friend asked where our food was and he told us he would find out and send the manager over to us. The manager, Taylor, came over and explained that our food was given to another table, that it food was being remade and that it was at the top of their priority. She said it would only take a couple more minutes and then asked us if she could get us anything. However, it seemed kind of useless to order an appetizer when our food would be coming out ""soon"". She wanted to let us know that this did not usually happen. However, she didn't really offer a solution or proper closure to the accident. We told her we were fine and we continued to wait for our food. After about 10 more minutes of waiting, Kenny, our server told us that he was sorry, our food would be out right away and that he knows that it sucks for us. Yes. It did suck. We didn't need to be made aware of that fact. So of course, we wait some more and finally after over an hour of waiting(total), our food comes.  The food was okay. Nothing special. Definitely not worth the amount of time we waited. We didn't order dessert because the amount of time we might have had to wait for it would be frightening. My friend asked for a box for her food and it was not given to her so she had to ask another waiter. We asked for our checks and we paid our bills separately. My meal came out to be $17.71 and I paid with a $20 bill. My change came back as $2. My other friends did not get full change for their meals either.

Its just unreal how poor this experience was.  No one was yelling or being rude to her, we just wanted to leave in peace at this point.  Of course, our bill is wrong, and we have to get her attention to fix it.  Whole experience took 1 hour and 45 min, without eating a thing...   And again, what really irked all of us about this experience was how unapologetic she was.  If she had just showed any customer service, where I could really see it wasn't her fault, I would've been fine about the whole experience.   But unfortunately, this experience has left a poor taste in my mouth for BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=40,2.28,2.43,2.868,1.924,2.37

We got a table right when we walked in which was good because I'm a person who hates to wait for a table especially if I'm starving. But we got sat down and it took someone 20 min just to ask if we wanted water. That's just bad customer service for me. I asked the waiter for a discount because no one should wait that long to be asked for a cup of water.  We ordered our food right there and than & got our food fast but it was just the worst experience at this bj's. & the general manager was thoughtful and took 10$ off our check.

The only ""good"" thing was us not having to wait long for a table. Everything after that was HORRIBLE. EDWARD G, our server, would throw down his notepad on our table while we are ordering & roll his eyes. Then while my friends & I would be in a conversation & EDWARD would come by it's like he would get angry & flip his hand then walk away. We had to ask for EVERYTHING (refills, napkins, utensils, refills AGAIN) it was really unpleasant for him to even come to our table at all. Finally we waited for our check & that was a whole 20-30 minutes more of my time wasted!! Finally when we go to pay they end up charging our card the wrong amount. They claimed they voided the transaction but that was all of the money we had on the card & they said the money would not come back to the card for a few days. Sooooooo how are we supposed to pay? The manager said the card would get declined & stated she didn't know how we are supposed to pay & it has NOHING to do with them. She basically said it's your problem, figure it out. Did she forget THEY charged US the wrong amount?? We never consented to that amount. By the way we arrived no later than 9:30pm the time was already 11:45pm & they close at 12 am....... LUCKILY a friend was there to spot our group. I regret not just walking out. This was the worst of the worst experience I have ever had my whole life!!!!!!! NEVER EVER GO HERE!!! 0 STARS!!!!!!

Thyme Chicken w veggies- not bad Avocado egg rolls- creamy Delish, the sauce is a bit sweet but it complements the dish well. As I waited she went above and beyond for a hungry pregnant woman.

Most of the servers (I've been here many times and have been served by most of the regularly staffed waiters/waitress) do not know how to smile, make eye contact or even give an inviting hello. It seems like many are so stuck up! It baffles me how so many people are staffed here and no one seems to even want to be there. I'm not a hard to please customer but I do know what's to be expected in proper customer service.  I can't even list the amount of faults this location has bc it will be never ending.  However my last experience was far too much. My sister and I spent over 2+ hours on this specific Monday night waiting and waiting for just 1 pizza and 1 pizookie. Our waiter never did care to help us and never offered us refills or brought utensils after bringing our food so cold and late. (We waited so long we just ate without even caring for the temp) yada yada. Not cool. We also ordered a pizookie and waited and waited and when I made eye contact with the waiter he was was ""shocked"" that we hadn't received our desert and came back with a almost black cookie! SO hard and cold! And said ""enjoy"" !?! It was so unbelievably burnt and he still brought it out thinking it would be presentable?! Wow.   I practically chipped my tooth trying to eat that ""pizookie"".  Oh well. The experience wasent as shocking to me bc I've had many experiences like the one mentioned above at this location.  I have spoken with HR or whatever or wherever they're complains go to with no help at all.

My boyfriend and I chose to visit on a Sunday night after both of us had worked long, hard shifts in the customer service industry. We were looking forward to a nice meal but unfortunately this was denied us by our terribly rude server, who will from this point forward be referred to as Man Bun. Our appetizer and waters were delivered in a timely manner but everything else just plummeted from there. Man Bun treated us like we were an inconvenience and didn't seem to care about doing his job. Our drinks took about an hour to be brought to our table, even though I could plainly see my drink sitting there getting warm as our booth was less than ten feet from the bar. No silverware was brought with our plates and Man Bun had disappeared. I had to flag down a passing server after being ignored for 20 minutes. My boyfriend's beer took more than an hour to make its way to our table, because that's how long it took our server to put in the order. During this time we actually attempted to flag down the manager, who willfully ignored us, and walked away. Man Bun didn't start providing decent service until we were finished with our meal, ostensibly because he was worried about his tip. It was too little too late for that, as I refused to leave a tip for the privilege of being ignored. In lieu of that, Man Bun received a hand-written note about bettering his service skills. It took away my appetite, and as I sit here eating my leftovers, I can only reflect that the food is much more palatable when not paired with horrendous service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry?start=160,2.68,2.37,2.784,2.244,2.494

Once he heard that, he didn't so much as make eye contact with us the rest of the night and he was extremely rude. The tip of the iceberg was when he left the check he told us to let him know if we  needed anything (even though his attitude showed he really didn't care) and my friend immediately said ""oh, excuse me, could we get a box, please?"" And he CONTINUED walking away without even acknowledging her request (mind you he stopped at the booth next to us and the restaurant WASN'T even busy) and I was fine with it at first, because I thought he hadn't heard her, but when he came back with the check he had her box and it was clear he was just being a jerk. The only time he was even near cordial to us again was when he tried to make small talk as he handed us the check.

But as the night went on and more people came to join us for our going away get together for a great friend and coworker things started to deteriorate. We asked to have separate checks and for the first couple hours it was fine, then when our server was off, they could no longer give us separate checks.  One of our party waited 30 minutes for his drink, another was closed out then told they didn't pay and another was over charged 3 extra beers. Maybe your staff should be trained a little more or get more staff. Better yet we were told that we would either have to move inside if we could find tables or if we stay out side we would not be served because no one on the wait staff wanted to serve us. No one wanted to serve us I asked again to be clear and was told twice yes that is correct. If we were to be served at all then whatever tabs we had at the bar would be combined and we would no longer be able to pay separately. When some of my party who had tabs went to pay their bills, found that the bill had already combined and when the paid it remained on the combined bill. So, now your telling me that your computer system can't handle subtracting a payment or is it your wait staff that can't?  This coming from a manager also stating that his server was doing us a favor by giving us separate checks in the first place????? WTF!!!!!! If you don't want to serve paying customers on the patio after a certain hour, then don't offer to seat them at the patio. Seriously, if your under staffed say so.... we would have understood. We work in retail we understand being busy and understaffed. I would suggest if your mgt is  going to flat out lie to a customer come up with something better than our servers don't want to serve your party because it's too big.

11,Karen K.,"Alhambra, CA",601,640,607.0,3.0,2017-07-29,"There will always be a need for mediocre pan-American restaurants like BJ's.  They can cater to large groups, and a diversity of different dietary needs and tastes at a price that is reasonable.   I've been to this BJ's a few times throughout the course of my life, and it appears to be relatively consistent with the quality of most BJ's.  They were able to cater to a large group with relatively no hiccups.   I ordered the Sirloin Steak, medium, with a side of cauliflower and a side of brussel sprouts.  The Sirloin was a tad bit more medium well than medium, but it wasn't bad.  It was about a palm-sized, fat chunk of meat with no unpleasant bits of fat, or bone, or tough bits.  Although it didn't have much circumference, because of it's width, I surprisingly could not finish it by the time the rest of my coworkers were done with their meal.  It made it's way into my midnight snack itinerary.  It was very consistently meat, all the way through.  There was a rosy hue in the middle without a trace of blood.   The Siracha Brussel Sprouts, while not being the best brussel sprouts I've had at an establishment, were surprisingly good for BJ's.  There was plenty of it, and it was well cooked and flavorful, but not too spicy (if you are a light-weight).  This was my favorite part of my meal, and I will order it again.   The Curried Cauliflower wasn't as tasty.  They had a bit of curried flavor and lentil, but it overall did not match with any of the flavors on my plate, and were probably one of the more disappointing curried dishes I've tried in my life.  I make a better curried cauliflower and lentil at home.  I would pass on this side, especially considering it is a premium item, and costs a little bit extra.   I skipped on the pazookie, this time, but BJ's is known for it.  It is a thick, super sweet, monster sized cookie that was meant to be shared by at least 3 people.  (It is much too sweet for any less than 3, in my opinion.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry,2.32,2.41,2.624,2.604,2.374

They were extremely extremely dry and hard to eat, very tough, not worth getting at all in my opinion but everything else was delicious, my burgers, the fresh batches of fries that kept coming out everytime we finished -  My peach drink was also very good but the only thing that bothered me was they don't mix it well with the tea and I didn't know so I slurpee a ton of syrup on my first try.

I ordered the chicken with soba noodles. It didn't look anything like the photo.

My family loves it. However after this incident we will no longer be coming back. The manager was rude. I was very disappointed. The staff always follows the leadership. If they have such a rude leader, they will service clients in the same manner.  I will be getting in contact with corporate to discuss this issue considering this gift card was purchased from BJs. Do not come here if you want to have a nice family dinner where the manager actually does his job instead of making you more upset.

We ordered ahead of time on their app just so we can save a little bit of time, but nope. Not the case.  We were originally going to be seated at a really small table, but we wanted a larger table and the hostess offered to push two tables together for us (not very nicely, imo). We asked about the booth and we ended up getting seated there, but the hostess clearly showed on her face that she wasn't happy about having to move the menus, even though we told her we already ordered via the app.  Finally got greeted by our waiter and again had to tell them that we already ordered through the app. He jotted down the order/premiere card number and said he's going to get that started right away. We waited for a while and still nothing came. Because we're on a one hour lunch, we were short on time. At the about 12:35, we followed up on our order and was told he's checking up on it. Within 2 minutes, 4 of the 6 items showed up, but weren't hot. We had two lemon thyme chickens missing and followed up, but were told that ""it's being prepared"". About 2 minutes later, a woman who seemed like the manager came out with our food and said they were having ""system failures"" and the food had to be punched in manually after. Which means that they forgot our order initially... and probably forgot to bring out the food because the center of the chicken was warm.  The food itself was mediocre. The lemon thyme chicken was way too salty and the brown rice underneath was really soggy from either the veggies or whatever sauce they had from the chicken.   In the end, we did get a 20% off discount, but for majority of this, nobody really bothered to tell us what was going on and they were not very apologetic about it either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry,2.68,2.57,2.62,,2.614

It is just not worth the price you pay to get it so inconsistent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-city-of-industry,2.64,2.67,2.632,,2.6580000000000004
