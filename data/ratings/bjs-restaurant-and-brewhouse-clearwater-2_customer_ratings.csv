If you're looking for American fare (burgers, deep dish pizza, salads, sandwiches), there is a vast selection on the menu...it might take you a while to make a selection.

45,Richard N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",36,141,27.0,3.0,2012-06-29,"I've eaten at BJ's a few times, and each time I go I inexplicably find myself liking this place, even though the food is very average. I've tried the pizza, salads, fish tacos, the loaded baked potato, and several of the appetizers, and they aren't bad, but the food doesn't wow me either. I give it 3 stars because the food really drives my ratings, with everything else adding a little bit to the experience. The only exception is the avocado egg rolls appetizer. These things are ridiculously good, with a tamarind dipping sauce. It's worth going here just for this! I could order this and have a couple beers and be very happy. Their beer selection is excellent with many imports, craft beers, and the regular domestics. Their own beer is very good and I have tried the Stout, the Red Ale, the Pale Ale, and the Porter, and I've liked all of them. It's a chain with a warehouse feel to it, and it's generally very crowded in the evenings and you have to wait. It's nicely decorated, clean and slightly upscale, and I have enjoyed my visits. I just wish the food was a little better.

I hear that the service at this establishment is not indicative of the other restaurants in the area, which is a complete shame.  The food is very good.....the service is plain ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2?start=100,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404

62,Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,741,216.0,3.0,2012-11-29,"I've been for dinner a few times. I like to start off with the brew sampler where you get to choose from a selection of 4 mini beers from the tap. They do have a great selection of different beer, but that's what I would expect from a ""brewhouse"". As far as food options, I've tried the chicken caesar salad. The dressing was excellent, but the portions were very heavy on the lettuce and very skimpy on the chicken. Meh. Also I have tried the gourmet mac and cheese as an app which was decent, but the hair that I found in the bottom of the bowl was most certainly an unwanted ingredient (this was my last visit there). On the other hand, the pizza is probably the best thing I've had here. Excellent flavor, soft thick crust and overall cheesy goodness make it worth another try. I am in the middle about this restaurant, hence why I gave it 3 stars, it's something everyone should check out, but I'm not head over heels crazy for it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2?start=140,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
60,C L.,"Clearwater, FL",8,54,36.0,4.0,2012-12-17,"For some reason, I thought I wasn't going to like this place, maybe thinking it was just a sports bar, but I'm giving BJ's a 4 star rating with limited exposure at this point.   When we looked at the menu, I was excited to see that they had ""snacks & small bites"" in one section of the menu.  I enjoy tapas like food because you can try more things and not get too full. So, we've eaten there twice, and I think we got the same thing both times.  I got a ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad"" snack or small bite, and the ""Angus Pot Roast Sandwich"".  The mozzarella and tomato salad was good, they use the small balls instead of slices, but everything seemed fresh and the size was perfect for one person. The angus pot roast sandwich rated ""delicious; should I have another""?  It's downsized from what you might expect, but the price is less as well.  Like I said, the small plates are nice.  Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables.  (I stole that off of the website).  Very, very good! We also split (on the second visit) the ""crispy fried artichoke hearts"" and they were fried perfectly.  Parmesan cheese was sprinkled over them and a garlic aioli accompanied them in a small bowl.  Not a fan of mayo products, I ate them without, and enjoyed them much. I don't know if you're a soda drinker, but I am particularly if it's something special.  Well, this place makes they own soda, and I guess they make 3 or 4 kinds everyday.  I tried an ice cold glass of their black cherry soda (OK, so I had 2), and that was spectacular!  Then they ran out, so I had a glass of their orange cream soda, which was really good too. So, we look forward to returning and trying something new (after I have that pot roast sandwich 1 more time)!  Did I mention that was a very good sandwich?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2?start=140,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

80,Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211.0,1.0,2012-12-18,"Well here it is -- my first ""one star"" review on Yelp...   I like B.J.s Restaurants.  I like the location in Pinellas Park a lot.  I was excited when they opened the Clearwater store so close to where I live. Each time I have gone, this location has been a disappointment.  The food is good, but the service is always marginal at best, and the prices are high for what you get.  I have been to the Clearwater location a few times, and each time I wonder if I will ever go back. Tonight, however, took the cake.  First, we tried to order two of the ""2 for $20"" specials they have been advertising.  At first we were told it was only one per table.  Really?  That seems ridiculous.  Then they decided to accommodate us by giving us two checks so they could give us two of the ""2 for $20"" specials.  O.k., whatever. Well this became a problem because we wound up eating in shifts -- two of us ate our dinners, and then the other two ate.  All in all, it took about two hours for dinner.  Not a good experience--caused by a work-around to a stupid policy. Then our waitress, who wasn't very responsive all night, disappeared.  With the two hour mark approaching, we asked someone else to take our check.  A third server then came back with the check and was very condescending--like he didn't want to work someone else's table.  My wife didn't care for his attitude and didn't want to respond to him, and he repeatedly harassed her about whether there was a problem until she said she didn't want to speak to him anymore.  He then argued with her and said she was being rude!  His true colors came out when he then condescendingly referred to my wife as ""Honey.""  Who does that?  Unreal. We complained to a manager on the way out, who took the server's side and basically asked us to leave -- saying that he didn't need customers like us.  I have never been treated like that in a restaurant before -- ever. Clearly the service we received at BJs is a product of poor management and poor training.  The conflict at the end of the meal could have been avoided if either the server or the manager had any people skills whatsoever. I am done.  I am sending a complaint to BJs corporate, and I am not going back to that location ever again.  If you go -- don't say you weren't warned! Updated on 12/19 -- Determined not to let that outrageous behavior stand, we contacted BJ's corporate office.  A regional manager returned our call and was extremely apologetic and agreed no customer should ever be treated that way.  I think this is going to be addressed.  Kudos to BJs for a good response.  Further evidence that BJs is not the problem, but this location is lousy--at least for now. Updated on 12/26 -- BJs corporate sent us a letter of apology and a $50 gift card.  That doesn't change my analysis of this location, but it gives me hope.  We will spend the $50 in Pinellas Park and review that location when we do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2?start=80,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

Now BJs is alright. We went mid day on New Years Day. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. It's a new restaurant at Countryside, but it's a chain. I've never been to one before this time.  The menus have a HUGE selection of alcohol, appetizers & pizza. I guess that's their main thing.

The egg rolls were AWESOME! I do have to give them that. The burger were good but mine was very under cooked. We couldn't tell the server because he was nowhere to be found. There was a special advertised in the paper for a 2 for 20 deal. That wasn't even in the menu or handouts. We didn't ask for it though since we picked items that wouldn't have been on the deal.

Its pretty much a standard franchise brew house. Fairly certain beer is not brewed on site, but I could be wrong about that. It's a Ruby Tuesday's with a slightly better beer selection. I had their light lager, comparable to a bud light. Not my favorite kind of beer, but its more wallet friendly than a nice bold craft.  I ordered the buffalo bison burger with a wedge salad, dressing on the side. I like my veg. No questions, no problem. Easy order.  Or so I thought.  Tell me yelp-verse, what does ""on the side"" mean to you? Maybe I'm wrong, but generally it means in a ramekin on the side of the plate. When my salad came it was drenched in dressing. Some dressing, whatevs, I don't care. But I  couldn't see any leafy greens, so I sent it back, politely explained that I asked for dressing on the side.  When my salad came back there was even more dressing on the salad. now completely surrounding the plate. I realized.. they thought I meant dressing on the side of the plate. Oh. My friend who is a huge fan of blue cheese dressing decided to take the salad and move it to his bill. So no harm, but I do feel like this is waitressing 101. The waitress added on to this by rolling her eyes  when she placed the second salad in front of me.  One other complaint, our food took over an hour to receive.

All portions are very generous with food, beer and wine. I am not a fan  of their cocktails. I do feel they are too weak and they are over priced. Cocktails are served in small portions and though VERY tasty, the booze content lacks big time (even for a lightweight) Their servers are hit or miss.

Service was great and attentive. They have televisions that show sports games, but they are only visible by the bar area and tables around there, and they are very high up on the wall, so it was difficult to see. Order the orange cream soda, it's the best beverage at BJ's (that's not alcoholic). Their special brews are also tasty, I enjoy their blonde ale. The table shared the BJ's Favorite pizza, which is a deep-dish with all of the toppings on it. I asked for the crust to be cooked a little longer because I like it crispy. I enjoyed the pizza the best out of the whole meal. We also shared the tuna tartare, which was okay. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything I wanted to order if I was on my own. I also ordered the mahi-mahi tacos for myself. You can choose how the fish is cooked, and the server said I could get one blackened and one grilled. So since I like variety, I followed his advice. Neither way made the tacos taste any less bland. It is served with a mildly spicy salsa and some green creamy sauce that was hopelessly bland. They also gave me two dried limes to squeeze juice on my equally dry tacos.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp Alfredo. It came with plenty of pasta and shrimp, but barely any sauce. He did not finish his meal and didn't even want it to go. The pizookie (pizza cookie) desserts are yummy, and I suggest ordering it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

One thing I don't like about the restaurant is it is cold.  Also, we would only see our server at random times.  It took us forever to get our bill.

He told us if we ordered now he could still squeeze it in, so I impulsively ordered two appetizers so they would be half off and my boyfriend got a beer. Once we looked at the menu we decided on a pizza. When we ordered he informed us they had a special going on for their tavern cut pizzas. For 25 dollars we got a soup or salad for each of us, our pizza, and one of their pizookies, which is a cookie skillet dessert with ice cream. It was a great deal so we got it. We had so much food. Our avocado egg rolls and garlic parmesan boneless wings came first. I get those specific wings every time I go to BJ's because they are that good. We tried to save room and only ate about half of our apps. Then the soup and salads came, I ordered a Caesar salad and he got the tomato bisque. Our pizza came pretty shortly after that and it was so good! We decided on the great white, which is a pizza with veggies and an Alfredo sauce.

I have eaten in all three.  My first BJ's experience was in Portland, OR when my boss took treated a few of us to dinner. I noted that they had 57 things on the menu that I liked.... and I am a healthy eater, my unhealthy friends call it finicky.. whatever. I was sold on the place. Back to Clearwater, FL.   I came here on a first date and my waiter never forgot me or my date.. further more he memorized what I had to eat each time... Now let me say, my visits aren't several times in a week... I get deployed for long periods of time, so this makes Ron's memory all the more impressive. The menu has changed a good bit over the years but, they still have an amazing selection... enough to keep everyone content... even the finicky guy. Big enough for a party, plenty of TVs, restrooms are always tidy, parking is plentiful but since it is at a mall near Whole foods, other restaurants that are open after the mall closes and the movie theater.  Parking can be a serious hassle at times.  Having a parking garage in the south/southwest side of the mall would be quite beneficial... even if it was only two floors.  Just an attempt to park double the cars in the same footprint would be nice. I would recommend this restaurant to others and although this location has messed up my meals 5-6 times and other locations did too... such as Citrus Park, Beaverton, Portland (2X) and Downey, CA (Read my review of that last one) I give  them 4 stars based on Ron being the most flawless server I have experienced ever.

The best part is that you can place your name on the list through their app and there is always some kind of special going on. I got their ahi tuna salad and enjoyed it a lot. The salad dressing was flavorful and there were dollops of wasabi on the edges in case you wanted to spice it up a bit. I have had many of their appetizers before and never disliked any.

I came in here starving, was thinking of going to another place but the wait was too long. I've seen this place many times but never looked them up so I was going on blind (also didn't realize they were a chain). First impression is this place is large and must have cost a fortune to build. When I saw the menu it reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory and not in a good way. The menu is a little book, scattered menu items throughout. Way too many offerings in my opinion but if you fill up a restaurant that large I guess you need to keep everyone happy.  I ordered the jalapeño burger. They provide a nice steak knife and it was a good size so I cut it in half. There was not a sign of any red inside for my medium rare request. Since I was starving and don't like to send back food I took a bite and it was quite good. The very attentive bartender came over after the first bite and asked how it was. I stated it was not medium rare but I'll still eat it cause it tastes that good. He stated it was no problem to cook another. I declined. He offered a free dessert. I declined assuring him it was fine and just some constructive criticism because he asked. A minute later the head chef came out and he could see the half of the burger that was not yet eaten. He now apologizes and again asks if they can make me something in a polite way. I decline  A few minutes later the manager gets wind of this and apologizes and insists on discounting my bill.  This is great service. They really take pride in their product and quality. All three gentlemen get major kudos from me. It is nice to point out a problem and not be criticized.

33,Robert S.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,3,,2.0,2017-04-27,"Unfortunately our first impression was established when the host led us to a poorly cleaned table top.  On our request, we were brought to a second table which had many drops of unknown liquid on one of the booth seats. When we asked to have this wiped down, host returned with a cloth and did a half-hearted swipe.  I took the rag from her and wiped it properly and sat down. Both seats in booth were torn.  One cloth napkin had a hole in it and should have been decommissioned without a second thought.  Cutlery was spotty at best - one piece was filthy and needed replacing. Another fork was bent but useable. These things above should never happen in a well-run restaurant. And they generally predict for a place run with insufficient attention to detail. Waiter was very kind, considerate and helpful. Beer was surprisingly good. We were given small tastes of the Piranha and the Hopstorm. Pirhanha was better to us, so we ordered pints. Good head on pints, delicious beer, perfectly cold, good lacing. Really refreshing. Food (california club sandwich and kid's grilled cheese) was grilled sandwiches, which had a distinct rancid oil flavor.  Kid's grilled cheese was really bad -- not sure if it was the grilling butter or the cheese, but really unappetizing. Club had less rancidity, but still a very unappealing twinge. Waiter informed management, who came and comp'ed the kid's meal, but didn't give the impression that he believed or cared that there might be a problem -- but he made it ""right"" for us so he cared about us even if he didn't show much concern for the business.

The general manager happened to read my last review and was so kind to send me a gift card for the troubles we had. We went back tonight, but decided to go to a differnt, closer restaurant. Here is my full experience since this time I actually got to try the food. We started off with an appetizer of potatoe skins, which I must say are EXCELLENT. My fiance ordered a burger and fries with a side of cole slaw. Mind you that we did have to pay extra for the cole slaw ($3.95). I ordered a rack of ribs with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. ALL of the food was EXCELLENT! I mean it was darn good! But then, we were low on drinks. The server came by and asked if we needed refills, we said yes. A long time went by and we had to stop him and ask if we could get a refill. My fiance tasted the cole slaw and it was spicy, which was weird, so we asked the waiter if thats just their cole slaw, which he informed us they have 2 different types, a spicy one and one that is more of a classic cole slaw. He asked the waiter if we could trade the cole slaw, because we didn't know they had 2 kinds, and the waiter said yes. He came back a couple minutes later and set the new cole slaw down and walked away rather quickly. We looked and it was a quarter of what the first cole slaw serving was When we saw the waiter again he said ""oh they have to make more so i just gave you what was left"" and walked off like that is ok. What he should have done was said ""Hey, I'm sorry guys they didnt have quite enough would you like to wait and i can bring you out a little more"" that would have been perfectly exceptable. Oh! but it gets better folks! We asked for a manger, the manager comes and we told him everything. I don't typically make a big deal of things like this but $3.95 is a bit much for a small bowl of anything and to not get a full bowl kind of well pardon my language, sucks. So the manger kind of blew us off and acted like his server was justified for bringing us a quarter of a serving. My fiance asked if it would be acceptable for bringing someone a half a pizza, which the manager actually said ""well.....i dont think so"" OF COURSE NOT! It is so sad that the food at BJ's is AMAZING and I would LOVE to frequent the restaurant, but with the service the way it is, and at more than one location, I will not be back. What this place needs to do is clean house as far as their servers go, or a training camp. It is almost like they are afraid to come out and tell their guests ""hey we dont have what you want, would you like something else, or like to wait while we make it"" Customer service is not that hard to do, and this place could be a lot better with the proper training and/or the proper manager to train them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2?start=40,3.48,3.59,3.59,,3.5460000000000003

In addition we were seeing all of the yummy plates coming from the kitchen. Decided on the roasted brussel sprout appetizer, cheeseburger, and the pick 2 lunch. The California chicken club and wedge salad was tasty. My guy said his burger is the best he has had since moving to Florida.  We saw that their happy hour is from 3-7 with $4 craft beer and 1/2 price appetizers. We can't wait to try it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2,3.4,3.58,3.58,,3.5080000000000005
12,Thomas D.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",0,16,1.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"I went to BJ's twice in the past month. Both times on a Saturday evening. The waiting time wasn't bad and the girl at front desk was nice and competent. The place was good and comfortable but the second time we were seating under an AC vent and it was FREEZING. Otherwise there is TV with football. Food is good. I ordered burgers both times and I really like them. They are cooked well and tasty. A special note to the dessert. I got the baked bignet. It is FANTASTIC! Price is ok. Me and my wife spent $50 for both of us including tip, so its not too expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2,3.52,3.6,3.6,,3.5680000000000005
11,Kit M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",36,42,12.0,5.0,2017-12-06,"Perfect evening at BJ's.  Years ago, we were regulars but stopped going because of a couple of so-so experiences.   Last night we decided to go back.  We were greeted by very nice hostesses.  Our server was Kendall, and she was awesome.  She greeted us promptly and was helpful in my dinner selection.  Throughout our meal, she was very attentive and sweet, My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potatoe fries, and I had the kale and roasted brussel sprout salad.  We both loved our dinners.  That salad was outstanding. We had such a good experience that we asked to speak to the manager (Ryan) and let him know.  He was such a pleasure to speak with.   We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2,3.6,3.62,3.62,,3.6120000000000005

Great service, great beers and the pizcookie to die for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-clearwater-2,3.56,3.62,3.62,,3.5960000000000005
