That's a total of 1 hour 45 minutes of waiting for the most mediocre food I have ever experienced.

As a baker, I know what my ounces look like and I am pretty bitter that they jipped me on alcohol. I did jot pay $3 for 3 oz less than what you're supposed to give me. I ordered the bison burger. It came out, was smaller than I expected to get from a restaurant. Islands' Burgers are so much bigger and better. The patty was just normal sized and didn't taste all that different from regular beef. The ""coleslaw"" that came with it was NASTY. It was so flavorless and was basically cabbage and maybe some other shredded vegetable. I had to ask for extra chipotle BBQ sauce (which wasn't all that astounding; could be something you buy at the store) and smothered the coleslaw in order to eat it. I wouldn't order this again for $9. Not worth it. I'd rather go back to my favorite Carter's Burgers. I tried my friend's berry beer and Irish Root Beer. They were very good. I don't like normal beer, so these sweet or fruity drinks really were up my alley. Service was nice but a little slow, considering it was the night when everyone is trying to eat out at night because all these undergrads got their rings. A good experience I had at this place was my first time here with my BF a couple months ago. I ordered the Thai Mango Salad and the endless root beer. This salad was awesome. I should have just ordered this again, but it was like $3 more than the burger. The sauce was great, the mangoes tasty, the crispy wontons were a nice addition. I bet this is one of the better items compared to the individual pizzas or the bison burger.

The very Amy Winehouse-looking host greeted us immediately when we walked through the revolving doors. We sat down and the server was super nice (my brother also works at this location) and he asked for our drink orders and I realized the huge draft selection they have (it's a brewhouse, duh but I forgot) and I orderd the Hopstorm IPA since I'm on an IPA craze right now. He also took our appetizer order, calamari. Drinks came out super fast and he took our main order the second time and also answered menu questions that my mom had. The calamari was fresh and came out in a decent serving size, also had the legs of the squid. Dipped those in ranch and marijuana and it was great. I ordered  another beer (Jeremiah Red) right before the food came out and I decided I liked the first beer better because I'm not too big on malty beers. I ordered the BJ's Favorite Hand-tossed pizza: it came with meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives and white onions. My mom ordered the ribeye steak which she loved because it was cooked thorougly with a tad bit of red, not dry at all, real juicy. My brother ordered thr Shrimp Scampi Pasta ( I tried it and the shrimp were medium sized, juicy and the roma tomatoes and light angel hair pasta all paired well). My pizza was very hearty and meaty, with thicker crust than I had imagined. Kind of reminded me of a thick-crusted supreme pizza from Pizza Hut, if I want to be honest. The only difference is is was more rich than a Pizza Hut pizza would be. Overall, the waiter was quick to respond to our needs, refills were quickly satisfied and we even topped it off with the pazookie as a dessert (it's a 3 cookie sampler, it was amazingly rich in chocolate and caramel and you can pick up to 3 different cookies). Left a nice tip and the hostess wished us a safe goodbye!

21,Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,668,,4.0,2015-12-09,"Great room. Average food which is getting better over time. One TERRIFIC item BJ's is a chain, and not a bad one. As Chili's steadily degenerates with cost cutting, short staffing and undertrained cooks - BJ's has become my new go-to for an all-American-bar-and-restaurant place. The decorating is terrific. You walk in and you immediately feel happy and that you are about to eat and drink very well. (Whether or not you actually WILL eat well is a bit of a dice roll at BJ's  but hope always springs eternal when a restaurant is spacious and classy.) The bar is heavy on corporate microbrews, and commercial flavored vodkas -  meaning this is not what I am looking for in a place to drink. Much of the food is ""that's nice dear"". The star of their show is the pizza. The pizza is dramatically better than what you would expect from a chain American place. What is their secret? Instead of tomato sauce, they use actual seasoned tomatoes. Using real tomatoes rather than commercial pizza sauce makes all of the difference in the world  on a pizza. American pizza sauce is flavorless red paint - that you make taste like something by dumping pepperoni on top of it. Real tomatoes taste like tomatoes - and BJ's pizza actually tastes fresh. Add that they have the strong flavored ""other ingredients"" that other pizza places ought to stock but don't. Anchovies. Asparagus Seasoned Brussels sprouts. And all the normal meat items you would like to see like italian sausage and bacon to allow you to forget the fact you are eating all of those vegetables. (Waiter, I'll take the bacon bacon bacon bacon and Brussels sprouts pizza!  Tell my doctor I'm eating healthy!) But jokes aside, actual decent ingredients with real tastes combined with genuine bona fide tomatoes means that you have a pizza that does not taste like a cardboard frisbee that has just been home delivered from Domino's. This is where I intend to hang out for a year or three while I wait for Chili's to decide if they actually want to serve food or they just want to concentrate on profits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.2800000000000002,2.96

I got the strawberry lemonade to start with, and I firmly believe that BJs has the best strawberry lemonade I have ever tasted As an appetizer, we got mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and calamari.

I want to first start by saying that, I love the whole concept around this restaurant. The menu is full of amazing things at somewhat pricy restaurant. Here are my issues.  For one thing, a salad is the simplest items on a menu to do right, right? So, WHY, do I keep receiving rotting greens? Quality control could easily fix this problem. I know tender greens get bruised and yucky fairly easy. Just go through it and throw the gross pieces out, I don't want it in my food. It's really not hard! Second time coming and for the second time, I once again got gross, rotting, mushy greens mixed  my salad. Bj's, STOP IT! If you're the manager and reading this, your getting 3 stars over LETTUCE! Fix it!!  My other issue is the promptness of your staff. I don't want to run out of water. When I'm ready for my check, I don't want to wait 20 minutes for it to finally come to me once I have asked for it. I was there on two occasions and it wasn't busy. Check your patrons, stop being lazy, and, if all else fails and your staff has NOTHING to do, sort the damn greens! See! Problem solved for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.64,3.1,3.1,,2.9160000000000004
11,Britanie D.,"College Station, TX",74,2,,1.0,2017-09-15,"This was the worst experience of dining out in College Station that I have EVER had. It was our 10 year anniversary- sat at the bar for a drink and an appetizer- we got beautiful drinks, guac & spinach and artichoke dip. 3 bites into my artichoke dip- I used the spoon to put it on my chip, and got a cheekful of PAPER TOWEL! I told the bartender who just grabbed both of the plates and handed them off to someone else, and continued working. Another girl came over and said we were prize winners of paper towel in our food and can she interest us in dessert. No thanks. My husband asked how this happened and she said well the paper towel holder is hanging over the dip in the kitchen. Im speechless at this point. Never will we ever ever ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.48,3.09,3.09,,2.8459999999999996
0,Morgan R.,"Houston, TX",197,85,98.0,4.0,2017-10-09,"First let me say, I only come here for PIZOOKIES!!!!!! I'm not originally from Texas, but when my friend introduced me to the deliciousness that is the pizookie, I was hooked! They have several different flavors of pizookies available and two sizes.  The regular size is perfect for two people! I recommend the classic chocolate chunk pizookie! It's served warm in a pizza pan with vanilla ice cream on top.  The cookies and cream pizookie is also quite nice if you want to branch out.  If you really want to enjoy your pizookie, DO NOT LOOK AT THE NUTRITIONAL INFO ON THE MENU. I love getting the pizookies here - they're a great treat to share with friends and family!  The restaurant is quite large, so the tables turn over pretty quickly, and there is plenty of parking available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.52,3.12,3.12,,2.8800000000000003

Other than that the service sucks, I could say worse but they just need more customer service in this place for how pricey it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.52,3.1,3.1,,2.8680000000000003

13,James M.,"Oceanside, CA",1,12,2.0,5.0,2017-11-26,This is our favorite chain restaurant in the area. We are yet to have a bite of food we don't like. The beer selection is great. Servers can be hit or miss but on this trip we had Charlotte who was great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.52,3.12,3.12,,2.8800000000000003

4,Dustin A.,"Dallas, TX",38,1,,1.0,2017-12-23,"Just left after sitting there for 20 minutes and the server only coming by our table once.  I have ate at several BJs across the country and talked my parents into trying a new place today.  The service really needs work, beside our slow server you really didn't see anyone that worked there moving like they cared about the customers....... unlikely that I will return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.68,3.13,3.13,,2.9499999999999997
2,Ross P.,"Katy, TX",16,42,1.0,4.0,2018-01-09,"For a chain they did a GREAT job. Food was very fresh, hot and fast. Had the flatbread pizza and the bartender recommended a side of extra marinara and it made all the difference in the world. If you are hitting a chain I have always found the food to be above the rest as far as chains go and the service is always good. Highly recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2,2.76,3.13,3.13,,2.9819999999999998
