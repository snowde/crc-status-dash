Service was slow but the manager was aware of this enough to come talk to us and bought me my first beer. Still not sure why our waitress was having a hard time serving her area...bad day....bad attitude....just not sure. One minute she was friendly the next a little peeved. The atmosphere when you walk in looks like an upper scale brew house but it is anything but that. I think they over dressed the place for what it really is. The beer was great. Had the Piranha and loved it. Had samplers of several other beers (don't remember them all) and both me and the wife liked them all. The food was really good. My wife had a chili burger and I had the turkey burger, both were great. All in all it was a decent afternoon out......worthy of another visit, but only three stars because the whole service thing and feel of the place kind of put everything off a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=220,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.732,3.4800000000000004

I home brew and am choosey about my beers, so I was pleasantly pleased with the selection and quality of the house beers they served...though I was SHOCKED by the prices for the beer.  Typical Chain Sports Bar Ambiance...when will these people figure out that Adults like to have conversations and don't all waste their time watching over paid children bashing each others brains out on UFC? Overall it was ok, but I've had just as good for MUCH less price. It's not a destination, but if you're in the area with no where else to go it's ok.

194,Courtney E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",7,3,,5.0,2012-03-05,"Before my husband came home from being away from a very long month, my friend Jamie took me & another friend to BJ's for lunch. I definitely was not expecting what I expected to see when walking into the restaurant for the first time.  This huge restaurant with plenty of seating inside & a patio for the summer, a huge variety of food and drinks, and a fun atmosphere with tv's all around to watch different sports. As soon as I found my friends I sat down to order me a drink, soda of course. But the alcohol menu is huge. This would be the kind of place a group of sports fans would go to watch a good game, have a great burger & some awesome drinks. For lunch I ordered a burger, with thin cut fries. When I got my food I was surprised by the size of the burger. It was big, and delicious. The fries were the best fries I have tasted in a while. I couldn't have asked for a better meal! It was so good! And for dessert we ordered pizookies! A yummy chocolate cookies with ice cream and for which one you decide to order you will get a little chocolate candy on the side of it. They have a few different kinds of pizookies! They are the best. I was so excited to bring my husband here to celebrate getting our new place. So this weekend we met my family for lunch. Everyone was pleased with the service. Our waitress was the best. And the food was approved by the family & my husband. We will definitely be going back to BJ's again! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=200,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9960000000000004,3.4400000000000004

That's right, sub par. $6.25 for beer unless you try one of their brews they make, none of the dark ones were very good. The blonde tastes like Bud. Still over $5 for those.

This time, our pizza came out cold.  I sent it back to get reheated and they comped it.  Still wasn't thrilled with sending back food because I always wonder if they would do something to it.  Also, our rack of ribs were dry and not flavorful.  Although they always comp the screwed up food, I'm not returning because it's a shame to have problems every time.  Look at my check-ins.  I've been there plenty of times, got the duke title, posted several pics of their food, etc.   I'm speaking from experience here and it's a shame because the food is good when they get it right.  So-long, BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.6000000000000005,3.3600000000000003

159,Cobra K.,"Singapore, Singapore",64,1257,5727.0,3.0,2012-05-05,Ordered the Southern Fried Chicken lunch special for $5.95.  It consists of 1 decent sized chicken breast breaded and then deep fried on a bed of mashed potatoes with corn off the cob.  The chicken breast was actually very tender and wasn't overcooked at all.  Overall dish was of good value for a lunch as long as you don't pay $2.95 for a soda.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=140,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.7,3.5200000000000005
201,Andrew I.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,18,,1.0,2012-05-12,"Oh my goodness, this place has taken a nose dive!  Initially it was busy, but still reasonably fast and the food was worth the wait.  We hadn't been there in 8-10 months and went back for a mid Saturday meal.  At 3:00, there was no wait to get in.  My family and I ordered drinks and apps.  The calamari was greasy, and overbreaded, out flat bread was dry and didn't have may toppings.  My wife's salad was dry, very skimpy on the dressing.  My tortilla soup was tasty, but didn't have a spoon.  When I asked for one, the server brought it holing it basically at the front end!  I wiped it off and ate.  Then, there must have been a 30 minute wait before our meal came out.  Mind you, this is mid-day on Saturday and it wasn't all that busy.  My son's chicken parm was good, but my daughters' spaghetti were both quite lacking for sauce.  My wife's shrimp tacos were under seasoned.  Last, my medium steak was well done.  I sent it back and it took at least another 12-15 minutes to get back.  By that time, everyone else had eaten, so I just got it to go.  I think, given the fact that the gravy and sauce on the side had congealed, that my food had been sitting for 10-15 minutes under the warming lamp and the steak overcooked.  Finally, after the manager (who had to be 25) came and talked to us, the server started going faster, but to the point of running!  It used to be a fun place to go for a good meal.  Maybe they just want to have you sample the brewery area enough so you don't notice the quality concerns.  Unless things change, I'd never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=220,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.436,3.4000000000000004
143,T.J. L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,1.0,2012-06-08,"Just had lunch there today and the service left a lot to be desired.  We waited 30-40 minutes for our food to be served.  They sent mine out 10 minutes before they brought out the rest of the meals for my friends. Being polite, I couldn't bring myself to start eating.  By the time my friends had their lunch brought to the table, my meal was cold.  Fun times! NOT!!!  If you're going there for lunch during work hours, be ready to explain to your boss why you're late getting back. I have eaten there 5 times since they opened and from the first to this last time, the service and the food has gone done hill. Needless to say, I will not be going back nor will I recommend it to anyone. On another note: If you decide to go there to drink, stick with drinking beer.  3 visits back, I ordered 3 Long Islands and walked out of there sober.  With this said, don't worry about a designated driver like I did if you are going to have mixed drinks.

We had a fairly large party, 14 or so I think, and they had no problem accommodating us and serving quickly and well.  I gave their non-alcoholic blood orange drink a try too, I thought it was pretty good, but my husband thought it was overly sweet. Maybe it's a girl thing.

224,Jenifer M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,15,1.0,2.0,2012-11-05,"Hmmmm....this place leaves me scratching my head. We went as a party of four. Our waitress (Kim) was excellent, although the time for our food to come out seemed a little slow. My husband's and my dinner were really good, but the kitchen completely messed up our son's order. (Not Kim's fault) He sent his food back. The rest of us were done with our meals when his corrected order finally arrived at our table. We really felt his meal should have been comped at this point, but we were offered two comped desserts. Probably not adequate compensation, but it was something. The kicker came at the end when we discovered our son's order had been billed twice. Not cool. It was, of course, corrected, but this was too much hassle for one meal.

BUT, the BBQ sauce on my sandwich was fabulous. I enjoyed that immensely.  If you want to try a good, filling sandwich, I suggest this one.

And of course you can't leave without trying a pizookie.  They' add seasonal menu items which is a nice change every once in a while.  Not really a beer drinker, but my friends have always been a fan.  They have a gluten free menu and take their prep seriously and will even take you back to see the prep area.  Since I'm a new gluten free now I was happy to see that.  The GF pizza is the best I've had.  Even better than the Ritz Carlton (CA).  I never feel deprived because of my new diet when I come here.  Also a cool place to chill and watch a game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.7359999999999998,3.1200000000000006

Right off the bat at the hostess stand which is the face of any establishment, they were engaged in a conversation which prevented them from greeting me and my family for about a full minute.  Here is some free advice to BJ's, your hostesses should not have their backs turned to incoming customers.

In past visits I had the calamari and it was surprisingly well done.  One note of caution the menu is rather large from tapas to pizza then salads and sandwiches, burgers, steaks, pasta, etc.  Nothing so far has been off the chain-- very safe and identifiable choices.  That is not to say the food is terrible-- none of my choices sucked but nothing so far has been ""wow"". Beer selection is varied and I prefer the in-house cream soda over their root beer and it is a full bar so mixed drinks and wine are also available.  So to sum up-- some people like Champps over Fox and the Hound-- BJ's is more of the same but is executed a little better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=200,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.54,3.0800000000000005

66,Nicholas B.,"Meridianville, AL",21,112,37.0,4.0,2014-06-19,"I ate there last night (6/18/14)with an old friend. My old friend happened to be the corporate trainer for BJs Brewhouse chain doing her check ups. This review is based solely on my experience with the food, obviously with her I got the best service.  The menu is large with plenty of drink/food/dessert choices. Their plentiful beers on tap were more then I could handle so I went with the cocktails. I went for the Snackbite which is Guinness&Pear Cider, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!!! The flavors married up nicely. I'm a Guinness Stout guy in my personal life so needless to say I loved it. My 2nd drink was the BJs Jack Daniels Berry Lemonade, I'm a religious JD drinker so anything new, I'm going to try. It's basically a Lynchburg Lemondade with the fruity berry flavor.  For appetizer we had the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aiolli. These were tasty, not full of corn in the fritter and the dough was pizza doughy. Bits of jalapeno inside but def not overpowering. Good flavor from frying. I could have gone for a dipping sauce but all in all, I'd order it again  My main course was the Jalapeno Burger with steak fries. What can I say, I love burgers. It's a grilled patty with pepperjack cream cheese, chipotle mayo and some other sauces that give it that kick. Personally I would have gone for more jalapenos but the over all flavor and appearance was good. You could taste the smoke from the grilling that just made it more enjoyable. I should have gone for the thin cut fries personally. Lesson learned.  For dessert we had the Pizookie Trio. I just thought it was ice cream but it was a fresh baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream. Three friggen choices of ice creams was overwhelming, so we did Oreo, Triple Choco Ghiradellis and Peanut Butter. Sugar rush galore, if you love love love chocolate I recommend the triple choco ghiradellis. Cause underneath is a chocolate cookie.  All in all, I enjoyed it.

Took forever to just order - would wiz right by our tabl, and when the food finally did come out, only 3 of four meals brought (no by our server) and my husband waited another 7 to 10 mins for his meal.   No ketchup for the fries, after waiting to ask someone... to no avail, husband actually got up himself and got it from the server's station.

Someone gave us a gift card to BJ's and when I looked up the reviews on line I was hesitant to try it because of how negative the reviews were. But we had dinner at BJ's on Tuesday night and really loved it. We were greeted warmly as we entered the restaurant (though I must say that parking really is a pain) and our server Ashley B was great. She checked in with us throughout the meal- always at the right time- and we never wondered where she was or if she would be back. She explained things well and gave us time with the menu since it is pretty extensive. They have a lot of beer and cider options which was kind of fun; this will definitely be a place we'll bring family who visit us because they love this type of place and those kinds of drink menus.  The place was really busy but we didn't have to wait long for anything. My husband got a Black Bleu Burger and he chose the skinny fries (which I ate half of- they were soooo good!) and he really liked it. I got the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad (which I know has a crazy amount of calories- I looked it up online- yikes- but I did ask for half of the dressing than they usually use so I'm pretending that made a huge difference). I loved the salad! We are new to Colorado and I have been struggling to find a salad that I really love. This one tasted delicious and I will order the exact same thing next time.  We were enthralled by their dessert menu and knew we would be ordering dessert. Since it was Fat Tuesday we had to order the Beignet and it was really great- warm and tasty with delicious strawberry drizzle, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. We both really liked it. We also got a mini Triple Chocolate Pizookie which was incredible. It's a chocolate cookie baked in a little dish that is warm so it was crispy on the outside and gooey in the middle, topped with Ghirardelli chocolate ice cream and mini chocolate chips. Definitely a perfect dessert for a die-hard chocolate lover. Wow. They also have a 3 Mini Pizookie dessert where you can pick three different ones- their peanut butter s'more one looks amazing too.  We told Ashley it was our first time at the restaurant and how much we enjoyed everything we had (we ate every single bite of everything) and she told us about the rewards program they have and went and got us the information and explained how it works. On our way out she caught us and said the program had some new ways to sign up so she wanted to explain that to us so we weren't confused- we were impressed with the extra effort she took.  Overall we didn't understand the negative reviews. Everyone was pleasant, Ashley gave us great service, and the food was delicious.

16,Rome T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",34,67,77.0,2.0,2015-06-13,Visited this place today and was not impressed at all. Our food took almost an hour to get then when they finally arrived the appetizers and main dishes all arrived the same time and was missing one of the main dishes. It seems they may have been understaffed as we noticed our waiter was serving all the tables outside and there was about 10. Definitely poor staff planning imo. Our waiter did his best and kept apologizing and gave us a discount at the end. Not his fault though.  In regards to the food..it was bleh. Pizza mostly dough..chicken wings was lacking flavor.

The pizza dough  and crust  was dry and tasteless .  The toppings weren't all that terrible  but they were not evenly distributed on top of  the pizza Should have probably stayed with a burger or something like that in a place like this. More disturbing was the service. The place wasn't that busy and I was in the area where other people were being served so it wasn't an isolated situation. Once I was seated it took a long time for someone to come over and ask if I wanted anything. Once I ordered it took a long time for the pizza to arrive.

It even makes up for the wait for the beer. My husband had the Amber Oasis which he liked a lot but the Salmon with quinoa did not pair well with it. He was very disappointed. Went ahead and ordered the salted caramel mini pizookie which was delicious if a little too salty but DID NOT go with either my Blondie/lemonade or my husbands Amber Oasis.

11,Tim H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,370,89.0,2.0,2015-11-28,"I'm going to think about coming here again.  Wife-unit and I desperately needed to get some couple time, her 92 year-old mother lives with us and sometimes we just need a break. So we get here.  I order a small steak which comes with two sides and I decide on both a soup and the small wedge salad.  They come together.  I'm just getting into the salad and my steak arrives.  I pass my tortilla soup over to my wife-unit so she has something to work on while I finish my salad, and either the soup or my steak is going to get cold.  Both soup and salad were delicious, however.   Wife-unit has a few spoonfuls of soup and her veggieburger arrives.  She bites into it and asks me to touch her patty.  It is cold.  I don't mean not-hot cold, or barely warm cold.  I mean iceberg-lettuce-fresh-out-of-the-refrigerator-cold.  Our server comes by, wife-unit asks her to touch patty,  which she does, says ""Gross!"" and hurries away with burger.  When a fresh, hot meal returns, I have, of course, finished my meal entirely.  Server points out that ""Chef personally cooked this.""  It was hot and nice.  I should point out that my steak was not great, smallish, a little tough and kind of an ugly shape. Frankly, when our bill came I was surprised to see that burger wasn't comped or that we weren't offered a dessert or something after such a major screw-up.  I would not have been surprised if our entire meal wasn't comped, actually. When I sat down to write this review my last review popped up.  It started out ""I'm giving one of our favorite places only four stars because of inconsistent service and to a lessor degree, food.""  So I had forgotten that BJ's had been slipping. Oh, the Manhattan on the rocks I ordered appeared pale and tasted different, I wondered if it had come up short in the glass and been topped off with club soda.  Tasted okay, just not like a Manhattan. 3/25/2017 Re-visited BJ's and found it was still in a downward spiral.  I ordered a Beefeater martini, server returned saying that they no longer stock Beefeater gin.  I'm sorry, but any bar worth its salt has Beefeater on hand.  I had a Long Island Ice Tea, and it was not as good as it has been in the past.  Red Robin and Famous Dave's both have far superior Long Island Ice Tea.  I think I will forgo mixed drinks here in future and either skip them altogether or get a beer. Frankly, I wouldn't have chosen to come here, but it was suggested by one in our party of four.  It is a shame, they used to be one of our favorite places.  I will be trying one in LA probably, and if memory serves, it was damn good in every aspect.  Here's hoping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=20,3.52,3.1,3.1,3.1440000000000006,3.2680000000000007
142,Ashley M.,"Antioch, CA",3,39,2.0,1.0,2015-12-01,"My boyfriend and I both got off of work early on a Saturday so we decided to go out to eat. We settled on BJ's as it is close to the house. This was about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and we arrived between 8 and 8:30pm. It was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. Waiter brought our drinks out right away and we ordered. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time. My boyfriend ordered pasta and it came out first and was pipping hot, you could see the steam rising off of it. He started to eat right away. A few min late my soup came out and it looked like it had been sitting out for a long time. It had that layer over it so who knows how long it had been sitting in that bowl. I took one bite and it was cold. I couldn't believe it. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. I took a smaller bite from the other side of the bowl just to make sure and it was cold. I waited 10 min for the waiter to come back. He asked if everything was alright and I said no and pushed the bowl towards him and said you can take this back. I never send food back, but this was utterly disgusting. He asked me what was wrong and I told him it was cold. He mumbled sorry and walked away with it. Another 10 min went by and he finally returned to the table and asked if I wanted anything else, but at that point I had lost my appetite. Then because I wasn't eating my boyfriend wasn't going to eat. We asked for the check. Another 10 min went by and we finally got it and a to go box. The waiter didn't really seem to care about what had happened, which is fine, but I was pretty upset and just to acted sympathetic would've been nice. We took my boyfriends pasta home and the waiter did remove my soup from the check, but when we got home he wasn't in a good mood either and just ended up throwing the pasta in the trash. It's unfortunate, but I feel like this one thing ruined our night. I've been to this location multiple times and have never really had good experiences or bad ones.

What keeps this from being a one star experience was that most of the food was decent.  Two of us had the Ahi salad, and found the ahi to be a little less than fresh, although the rest of the salad was excellent.  My friend's buffalo burger and my husbands flat bread pizza were delicious, as were the egg rolls and calamari we ordered as an appetizer.   I sincerely doubt any of us will return to this particular restaurant. UPDATE - The manager called and gave a very sincere apology.  I was pretty impressed.  Additionally, he did everything he could to make things right, including giving me his personal cell number to make our next reservation.  Every business will have off days, but how they handle it matters.  He certainly did his best, and I'm very impressed.  No one has ever gone to these lengths to make me happy again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=80,3.44,3.14,3.14,3.1800000000000006,3.2600000000000007

The lady serving us was great, but we felt like she was running around like a chicken with a smile on her face. Someone needs to hire more people to run this place instead of overworking their employees. The pan pizza was the only thing that tasted like what is offered at other BJ's locations. Ordered the chicken taco, hot and spicy buffalo wings, and my favorite stuffed mushrooms. Wasn't too happy with the last three dishes. I took a to-go box with hopes to finish the food at home since we are totally against the idea of throwing away food.

39,Mellisa W.,"Highland, Denver, CO",2,34,26.0,5.0,2016-05-20,Wow I'm so pissed off. So I ordered the ahi tuna - and it had cilantro in it and I told the waitress (who was very nice) that I hated cilantro and asked if I could get a new salad. She said yes. (I tired in vain to pick out the cilantro but - it's all green!!) She left the plate there - and I used to work at a restaurant and I know that they toss everything that is returned and I didn't want to waste it so I ate the tuna part The restaurant could have replaced just the salad part or tell me AHEAD of time that I would be charged twice... You cannot just tell someone you will replace it and then charge them - that's robbery! I understand that Bc I got double serving of tuna - but they should have told me ahead of time I would be charged extra. I would've been ok with getting just half a plate replaced with salad and no tuna!!! The food was fine - great even. Edit: Jason their manager knew who I was the moment he picked up the phone (called right after). He did apologize and drop the charge. I appreciate being heard. I want to applaud Brittany for relaying my disappointment. Again - I'm a fair person. I know I finished the tuna and returned half of the salad and I ended up with a whole new salad (with tuna) - but I only finished the tuna because I'd hate to waste food. Had they told me I would be charged extra - I might have either been ok with it or just ended my meal there. I was only upset because I was charged without being told ahead of time.

The dipping sauce was general but added to what would've been an otherwise completely bland meal.  My friend had the Parmesan chicken and said that it was very dry and over seasoned.  My lemon drop was ok. I had it with Kettle One so the taste was fine but I wouldn't recommend ordering it with the well vodka or it would be much less delicious.

It had random pieces of spinach and 3 slivers of carrot. Not sure if that was supposed to be in there.

I've been there a handful of times since then, for lunch, dinner and desert. As always the service is top notch and the best in the Springs and among many other places. I was recommended Double bone in pork chops with prime rib dip by the Executive Kitchen Manager, Zak. The waitress offered plenty of meals, but my colleagues were besides themselves and needed more time to decide. I couldn't blame them, this menu is huge and it's truly amazing with the amount of people that dine here and are able too cook it to perfection in a timely manner. A bit off topic, but deserves the spot light. Zak, had been visiting tables and talking with guests and I noticed him from the last time, but couldn't remember his name for the life of me. Luckily, he reintroduced himself and asked if there was anything we needed help with, asked us about our evening and recommended that beautifully cooked double bone and 2/4 of us ordered it. The other two were ""vegans"" lol but without any hesitation when I gave them a hard time about it (friends of mine) Zak recommended a few key dishes and when they came out I knew what I would get next time. Lastly, he stopped by again to ask how it was and over light conversation we found out about the catering option. Needless to say we brought it to our work center and will strongly recommend booking with BJ's. If not, I will myself for the volunteer event in the summer. Don't bother debating on coming here.....just come here you will be beyond satisfied. Just call ahead and make reservations during busy times when most people are at lunch or off work. If not, wait no matter how long the wait is because there isn't a better establishment.  Superb job BJ's  and thank you again Zak and our waitress who politely asked not to be named. =) 10/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs?start=20,2.48,3.14,3.14,,2.8760000000000003

So I call again and a different girl answers and I said I was hung up on I'm trying to reserve something and before I could finish the sentence she said ""well yeah our managers won't talk to you during a dinner rush so you can call later or tomorrow"" and just hung up on me AGAIN.   I mean to say they ""WONT"" talk to me   Could have been said nicer and the first girl instead of transferring me just hangs up? And then makes another girl answer I mean they stand right next to eachother.     So either manager said no won't talk and she just hung up or she took it upon herself to do that    I would have been fine if someone explained the managers are to busy with a dinner rush although I doubt they can't take 3 minutes to look at a date and time and say yes or no if available but it was the way the hostess handled it. Equally as rude as one another.   So since I was a simple inconvenience during ""dinner rush"" for a little phone call I figure a party of 20 would be even more of an inconvenience and decided not to call Back and book it which was extremely disappointing as most of the staff hadn't tried it before and was excited with how I  Raved  about the food and atmosphere   We will Be next door at bonefish with a $1500 tab and hefty tip. So was their loss but also mine as I will think twice about returning due to the lack of customer service. Positive and good Experience goes a long way at restaurants but so does  Rudeness and lack of customer care.  I was a manager at a restaurant for a long time and I would literally let a hostess go for treating someone like that hanging up 3 TIMES and admitting the managers (plural so clearly should have time)  just simply doesn't have time for u right now.    Which is potentially because they were dealing with other complaints at that rate.     Gave 2 stars cause my lunch just last Sunday (and most sundays).   was great and the waitress was awesome as well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs,3.24,3.18,3.18,,3.2040000000000006
25,Austin B.,"Centennial, CO",130,26,16.0,4.0,2017-12-15,Food and service were pretty good. I got Italian and it was okay I wouldn't go if you were looking for just Italian food but it's nice that they have every different kind of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs,3.36,3.18,3.18,,3.2520000000000007
21,Matt H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",151,240,157.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"This place A-OK.  It's the kind of place you go when everyone in your party can't agree on a place to eat, and you're not feeling adventurous or like trying something new, but you know you want something better than Chili's or Applebee's or TGI Friday's.  BJ's is that - it's a step above a lot of chain restaurants, but not by a whole lot. The prices are high for what they're offering.  The food preparation is rarely consistent.  I'll explain... but I'll try not drag it out. If you order your burger or steak 'medium' (it's a crime to order any piece of red meat over mid-rare, but we'll allow it for this example) you almost certainly won't receive a 'medium' cook - you'll either get it rare or well done, but you certainly won't get it the temperature you ordered.  If you order a salad, especially a house salad or a caesar - maybe ask for the dressing on the side, unless you prefer eating your salad with a spoon.  Yeah, they're usually drenched in that much dressing.  I've ordered burgers there a few times and they're usually under-dressed or just lacking in condiments and unless you've gotten that mid-rare cook you should have requested, that burger is going to seriously need some condiment love.   Don't get me wrong - it's fine; the flavors are usually alright.  And if you're forcing me to pick between BJ's and a multitude of other fast food places I'm choosing BJ's more often than not.  I've always had pretty good service there. I've almost always gone for lunch or business meetings, so maybe the dinner vibe adds something I'm missing, but it's not a place I'm rushing back to by any means. And for what they're charging and their inconsistency in food service, I'm not buying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-colorado-springs,3.4,3.16,3.16,,3.2560000000000007

Our waitresses name was Courtney and she had a great sense of humor and a great personality! Also they said our wait time was 30-40 minutes but got a table within 15-20 minutes.
