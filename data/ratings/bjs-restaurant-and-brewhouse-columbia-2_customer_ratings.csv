3,William B.,"Cayce, SC",364,119,,4.0,2017-09-26,"Very impressed with this new restaurant.  My wife and I had a chance to try it on the evening of September 25th.  They seem to have a little of everything.  We were told it started as a pizza place, and then they started making their own beer.  They have pretty much everything you could think of.  I got the brisket bbq burger and it was fantastic and so were the fries.  My lady got the pizza and I really enjoyed the slice I tried, kind of a deep dish pan style.  She got a blonde lager and said it was good. I opted for the bloody Mary and I was a bit disappointed.  I couldn't figure out what it needed, but it was missing something for sure.  We tried to order the avocado eggrolls, but they had run out of them.  They were kind enough to comp us an appetizer though.  We got the tempura asparagus instead, and it was quite tasty, but I would go with more of a teriyaki sauce than the ranch-like sauce. They actually brought us some of the eggroll sauce, and it was quite good, sort of a sweet and sour.  I look forward to returning, next time I'm going to try the chicken sandwich.  Oh also they had half off pizza, not sure how often they run that special, but it was a heck of a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2?start=20,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007
4,Brooks W.,"Tucker, GA",144,11,,5.0,2017-09-30,"This place is so different and refreshing to have in Irmo! I think the restaurant is a great choice for several reasons. 1) they have a HUGE menu. Like so many options. I have the tacos and they were really good. 2) free beer samples. They have like 12 brews made by BJs that you can sample. 3) Nice atmosphere and kind staff. They gave my dad a birthday cake and didn't sing happy birthday, which he really liked. Anyway, I would recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2?start=20,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004
11,Greg W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",66,5,,1.0,2017-10-01,"Their service sucked. We walked in having already called ahead, and were on their waiting list. Finally after awhile we asked about our table  they forgot about us. Then we sat there for about 30 minutes at a table but no one came to to the table.

24,M. W.,"Chapin, SC",0,9,6.0,1.0,2017-10-06,"I don't know how this restaurant will get a return customer. Walked in around lunchtime on Friday to see four 6-top tables that had only two people in them. We had a party of seven and were told that we had to sit at separate tables. As I shook my head in disbelief my wife told me to just deal with it. Evidently the normal time frame from getting drinks to being able to place a food order here is fifteen minutes. Make sure you put aside at least two hours for a meal here. At least that's my best guess. I Still haven't received my food. Will update time if it changes. Now I'm looking at my angry wife waiting on food and I told her ""just deal with it"".

25,Jennifer B.,"Columbia, SC",41,6,1.0,1.0,2017-10-07,"Once again another restaurant in Columbia falls short.  To me it reminds me of a bigger more expensive Applebees but with more tvs and more variety for beer (unfortunately I am not a beer drinker).  The menu is a bit overwhelming with the same type of items you would find at an Applebees, TGI Friday's and/or Chili's. Service is sub par at best.  Was not given silverware or a napkin until right before our main course was brought out.  The waitress was very inattentive and spent majority of her time talking to the table behind us with another employee. The food I wish I could say it was good but unfortunately the majority of it was inedible.  The queso dip is clearly Velveeta with some spices, thin sliced onions and a few jalapenos mixed it. I ordered the mini BJ special deep dish pizza.  Pizza arrived cold to the point of what little cheese that was on it had already started to harden.  The green peppers were basically raw, little to no sauce and basically after one bite I knew that I did not want to take another one. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and he also was not able to eat his due to the meatballs were not cooked all the way.  Undercooked and mushy is definitely not appetizing.  He also ordered chicken pita tacos and he said those were ok. I am giving one star due to the manager apologized and removed the pizza and the meatballs from our bill. 2 hours and $10.48 later we left frustrated and hungry.  Luckily Chic-Fa-la was still open. This was our first and last time, too many negatives to warrant giving BJs another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002

I wasn't impressed with the slow smoked pork chop. But that's because I personally don't like sweet meat.  Update : last night my boyfriend and I went in for a to go order and the young lady at the counter had such a disgusting attitude. I sat back and watched as she rolled her eyes , huffed and puffed , and displayed negative body language to my boyfriend and the customers ahead of us. I called up there and spoke with a manager and she sounded like she'd take care of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
10,Dave F.,"Columbia, SC",0,6,,3.0,2017-10-11,New and nicely laid out restaurant. First off our server was great. She was very attentive and gave recommendations. Which I like.  The menu was massive almost liked a magazine. I asked my self with all these food options how could any of them be great or really fresh.  Well that's where they fall short.  It was average at best. I had the Italian pandina. That kind of reminded me of a hot pocket.  Same shape but more filling .  It was so so.  Friend had two fish tacos. He said it was good.  It overall was just about another chain restaurant doing their thing. Great server though.  Will give it another go,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2?start=20,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005
2,Erica P.,"Columbia, SC",0,3,,2.0,2017-10-12,"The positives were the atmosphere is lively, plenty of tvs and the food was good. The negatives were the price to food ratio and the service was awful.   Our waitress was nice at first, but extremely forgetful. I thought it was because she was busy with other tables. We had to remind her of refills several times and even still waited 10 mins to get the refill. By the time it came, I was almost done with the meal. When the entrees came out, the salad plates weren't clear and were just pushed over then ignored by the waitress. She finally took them when I placed the plates almost hanging off the edge of the table.  I had to remind her that my meal came with the dessert so I could let her know what kind I wanted. The only thing quick about her was bringing the check. The food was good, but not worth the prices. My husband ordered a deep dish 6 in. pizza and it was $15. I got the special with ribs and the serving size of the sides were less than what I would consider a child's portion. After paying, waited another 10 mins for her to bring back the change (paid with cash) and was shorted change. Again, I thought she must just be busy until we were on the way out and we saw her sitting up front in the foyer on her cell phone.  Overall has some kinks to work out.  Will probably try it once more and hopefully get better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2?start=20,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

9,K G.,"Lexington, SC",0,5,,2.0,2017-10-15,Black female hostess walked away when me and my wife approached the hostess desk to be seated.  Eventually came back and told us it would be 5-10 minutes. Two booths were open the entire time and after 10 minuets seated us in the open booth.  Black folks came in and they were greeted with a smile immediately.

8,Ashley B.,"Irmo, SC",0,13,2.0,3.0,2017-10-30,"The food was delicious, but a bit overpriced in my opinion. It was $12 for a sandwich and fries and while the food was good quality, I could have eaten a comparable meal elsewhere for cheaper. Beer flights were nice, tons of options to choose from, I highly recommend the BJ's Pumpkin Ale. I came to comment on the tablets they use for taking orders...we waited for 10 minutes before we could successfully order our beer flights and meals. My flight was entered on the tablet, then it had several malfunctions and flustered the server causing him to step away and then return (twice). After about 5 minutes, I was sitting with a flight in front of me but my date hadn't even ordered his flight yet, nor had we ordered food. I wondered why the server didn't just write down our orders and step away from the table to fix the tablet issue. Our server forgot to bring us waters, forgot to bring us a to go pizza box, and overall seemed flustered throughout our meal.  If I go back, I'll be going straight to the bar and eating there or I'll be sure to go in a typically less busy time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2?start=20,,,,,

Sunday afternoon was busy but we got in with no wait luckily. The place was clean, new and TV screens all over positioned so all can see from diff angles. This is obviously gonna B a great place for meet ups, parties and jus to relax and with friends. Our waiter was kind and friendly, took our order promptly with no wait. All the food was fresh and  had a great taste. The portion size was good and I took a to go meal with me, I couldnt finish it all. We did start off with a clam chowder sour dough bowl and spinach dip. The mac and cheese was the best. I dint have any issues and I will be back for more. They have a desert menu that we ill try next time. *Tip: Arrive early, its a new spot so many are trying to visit, most of the waiters are very young, B patient and kind...we all have been there before!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,,,,,
26,Humberto A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,6,1.0,3.0,2017-11-06,"Pros: tasty food, huge selection, probably a cool drinks-and-desserts kinda place. Cons: huge selection  (way too much), price/value,  food temp. Went there with the fam for dinner. Nice atmosphere, lots of customers, good times. Staff was friendly, fast and attentive. The menu is just ridiculous. 130+ items, even the staff makes jokes about the selection. While what we got was tasty, it wasnt amazing, and the price/value isn't great ($75 pre-tip for 2 adults, 2 kids under 6 and no alcohol, no apps, no steaks etc.) Its pricy for what you get. Our food wasnt piping hot either. More like, just warm. The ""pizzookie"" dessert thing was very good and the bar looked well stocked. And of course their large selection of beers....so maybe this is more like a late-evening drinks and dessert kinda place. Their origins was as a pizza joint so i prolly give them another chance and try the pizza. Other than that, I'll just be back for drinks and something sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,,,,,

19,Ryan J.,"Lexington, SC",4,10,28.0,4.0,2017-11-13,"Nothing but good things to say about BJ's on a Saturday night. Before you read the review, you should know that there is one thing you need to do on a Saturday evening. Make sure you use their ""call ahead"" service on the weekend. This is an absolute must if you want to not wait for an hour and a half to be seated. I used the service and called a head an hour before ingot there. My family of 6 only waited for 20 minutes! it was fast prompt and they sent me a text message letting me know that my table is ready. I implore you to utilize this service! Food review: BJ's has a large and eclectic alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink menu. There is something for everyone here. Their mixed drinks are fantastic. I had an alcoholic berry punch that was so good I had 2. I did not have any of the beer. I will save the brew testing for the next visit. They also have their own house made sodas. The root beer was fantastic and had a strong root beer flavor. Something you would have at an actual soda shop. Same with the cream soda, very strong and rich flavors for a soda. After drinking those you wish they would bottle this stuff.  The food menu is large. Really large. Looking through the menu can get rather difficult because there is a lot to choose from and you want to try it all. A plus that I noticed is that they do have vegetarian options and low calorie selections that don't seem bland. The food here is well made and has great flavor. For the appetizers I had an order of chips with salsa and fried calamari. You can tell the fried calamari is made in house and not bagged. Absolutely amazing. The chips were just regular tortillia chips but the salsa was on the money! Deep flavor with a slight spicey kick. My main dish was the enlightened Mediterranean chicken pita tacos with bistro grains. It was fresh and bursting with flavor. The bistro grains were the highlight TBH. It was quinoa that was dressed like a pasta salad! Slammin'! Other members in my party had the roasted shrimp peruvian quinoa bowl (so good! Flavorful!), the double bone-in pork chop (huge piece of meet that was cooked to perfection. Succulent meat), prime rib (cooked rare and was perfect) and kids meal chicken alfredo (wasnt too saucy and had a great chicken to broccoli balance). Kids meal comes with free appetizers of a roll (warm and soft) and a cup of grapes.  The service was excellent and all of our food came out fast and everything was accurate. No one was nasty or mean. Everything flowed smoothly. If you're looking for a quite place to eat you will have to go somewhere else. All of the college football games were on and it was a lively energy in the restaurant. The only think keeping me for 5 stars is the bathroom. Also, the price is a tad bit more than what I would usually pay. But, it's not as bad as people say it is. The men's and ladies room needed to be cleaned. All-in-all, i had a wonderful dining experience with great food and an energetic atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,,,,,
15,Grace M.,"Greenville, SC",12,162,21.0,1.0,2017-11-15,"This place is nothing special. It's probably okay to grab some drinks and watch the game, if you don't mind the wait. You can definitely call ahead and put your name in to make things a lot easier on yourself.  The food is waaay too greasy and the service is mediocre. I'll chalk it up to it still bring fairly new. Their gluten free pizza is decent and what you'd expect from a place like this. My little cousin ordered their grilled cheese and it looked as if it were soaked in oil. Not very appetizing. They do give a free mini appetizer with children's meals, so that definitely helps.  The last time I was there, the tables smelled like bug spray and there were ants crawling all over my table. So needless to say, I will probably never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,,,,,

This eatery is just what it's name sounds like, and has a version of every bar food known to man. The place is huge. The atmosphere is open and kind of loud, but convivial. Our waiter was excellent and had a good sense of humor. My Santa Fe salad was delicious and huge. I coudn't finish it. My husband chose blackened salmon over rice with a side of broccoli. Predictably, there was an over-abundance of the broccoli part with an adequate supply of salmon and rice. It was fine. However, the side salad that he had to pay extra for, was not fresh. the lettuce was wilted, and the blue cheese dressing was bland in the extreme. I like wine not beer with my meal, and it was expensive. However They do have half price Tuesdays.

Our first time was in New Jersey last September and we had a really great experience. The Harbison location had the exact same set up and consistent service and quality of food. I had the BJ's Tontata beer. An excellent choice for dark beer lovers. It had a hint of sweetness with a smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste. My mother-in-law had the house margarita. She said it was like any other restaurant. For appetizers we had bone in chicken wings (10 wings total), Lemon Pepper (5 wings, tasty if you like dry rub) and Root Beer Glaze (5 wings, something different, tasted sweet and yummy). We also had the Lettuce Chicken Wraps, which is very light, barely any meat and messy. Recommended for those that plan on saving their appetite for the main course and dessert. For salad I had mozzarella and tomato. Nice presentation, doesn't seem much but satisfying if you like cheese. Then I had Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon that had a nice sweet taste, served with roasted asparagus and spinach couscous. My wife had the Hickory Brisket Bacon Burger with fries. The bacon was soggy fatty and had to be replaced with crispy bacon, no problem. She enjoyed the burger and would recommend it! My mother-in-law had the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne pasta. There was not that much asparagus but had a decent amount of shrimp. The dish was very good. For dessert we shared the Pizzokie Trio- a must-have when visiting BJ's restaurant. The flavors we had were Snickerdoodle (seasonal), Caramel and Chocolate. It was orgasmic lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

The servers are very nice but it doesn't make up for them being so dang slow. The computers they use to input the food are ridiculously slow. It definitely ties them up at the tables. The first time I went I was told the pizza was 1/2 but unfortunately it wasn't the right night for that special. The manager did however give it to me Half price. The second time we ordered a burger cooked medium and received it well done. We also ordered the Tuna Ahi salad with the tuna seared more since my friend is pregnant as well as the dressing on the side. Got neither. The burgers were supposed to be $10 on special and was brought my check with the full priced burger. At this point I was so annoyed I just wanted to leave but we couldn't because the server took 10 minutes to bring us our credit card receipts. There are plenty other places that I'd rather go to get my order wrong.

Will definitely come again to try some more options on the menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

Now the boot so good. Every time I've been,  they did not have something we wanted to order.  Bad kitchen management.  The iPad style they do your order seems to slow down staff.  I also have had bill wrong over half the time,  charged for stuff we did not get.  They need to fine tune the staff and have enough food if they are going to do that huge menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
27,Melissa H.,"Lexington, SC",0,2,,2.0,2018-01-06,"Do not get a pizza!!! It's missing cheese and meat.( for the price ) I had to send my back( I'm not that type of person) and when the manager came back with a new pizza it was still missing cheese on a medium pizza. Manger was nice to take the pizza off.   I contemplated leaving when the manager came with the second pizza, but after 2 hours I was hungry. No matter it was a deep dish pizza with no cheese, sauce or little toppings.  I would recommend they take that page off their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

The manager Sunshine was really nice too, she came by the table to say hello.
