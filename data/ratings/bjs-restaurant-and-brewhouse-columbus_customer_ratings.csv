154,Michael K.,"Dublin, OH",23,8,,2.0,2012-01-29,"My wife and 4 friends decided to go to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse to catch up on  our lives over a meal.  We know that getting in on a Saturday night is usually a tough thing given the popularity of the restaurant.  We took advantage of the call ahead seating.  I called at 6:00 pm for seating at 6:30 and was told by the host that the wait was 1 and 1/2 hours.  When we arrived, there about 70 people in the waiting area and spilling into the bar area.  When we checked in, they told us that the wait would be 45 minutes (which is not bad).  We spent the time in the bar chatting with our friends and having a drink.  The wait was more like an hour and 15 minutes and we had started to talk about going somewhere else.  Finally, we were seated. [Note #1: avoid Saturday night and the long wait.  There's got to be a better way to handling the crowd and getting people to table quicker.  While time wasn't a problem for us, had we had other things going on that night, we would not have been able to make it] BJs has a great selection of beers brewed on site and my favorite is the India Pale Ale.  Nice and hoppy, with a good finish. Tableside service was very good. Our waitress checked on us frequently but was unobtrusive.  And despite the huge crowd, the meals came quickly.  For my meal, I had the half rack of ribs with baked potato and salad.  The salads were good sized portions with lots of extras in them: carrots, croutons, and a mix of lettuces.  I didn't ask for the dressing to be on the side so it was already on the salad when served.  I could have used a little more dressing, but that wasn't a problem. My main course, though, was disappointing.  The ribs were very dry and really didn't have much flavor.  They were coated with a barbecue sauce that was ok.  The meat did come right off the bone, so they were done properly.  I think that they had been made well ahead of service and were sitting somewhere and got dry.  They did have a nice char on the outside of the sauce, so they were fired before being sent to the table.  The baked potato was very large, but was also dry inside.  I eat lots of these things and I'm not sure how you get it so dry in the middle.  I had to ask for more sour cream just to soften it up. This was the second meal that I had a BJs that I thought was underwhelming. I asked my friends how their meals were and they said that they liked the food, so it must just be me. The bottom line for me is that there are some really good restaurants in Columbus, and, for now, I plan to go to one of them instead of BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=180,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.1760000000000006,3.8
111,Jaycee M.,"Columbus, OH",11,37,,4.0,2012-02-17,"Met for a dinner with 5 other work associates this week.  My first few times here were so uninspiring that I have not been back for several months, but a colleague suggested the location, so I found myself returning. It was a good experience, the food was wonderful and the customer service was some of the best I've encountered recently. From the hosting team, to the main servers, to the food runners; everyone was appropriately attentive and friendly. Our group had quite a few special requests as well, not only from the bar but a few in our team were attempting to rewrite the menu, all the while the wait staff was patient, smiling, and warm. THIS is the customer service I expect and returned my appreciation with a fat tip. The food quality knocks one star off my review, as my expectation of salmon is not to be over cooked and my hope for micro brew is to enjoy it in a clean glass.  Overall, way better than my first few experiences so thanks to a work dinner and impressive customer care, I'm ready to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=140,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.472,3.76

I had the chicken tortilla soup for my appetizer. The way they served the soup was unique...the avocado, onion, and tortilla strips were brought out in the serving bowl and the soup itself was brought out in a little metal carafe. The server poured the chicken soup in the bow at the table. The soup was very good and would certainly warm you up on a cold day!  The soup was so good that I can't remember what I ordered for my entree...it was a burger....but uninspiring!  The next time I am in Columbus I will definitely go back after work so I can sample the beer selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=140,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.572,3.8

157,Shawn K.,"Strongsville, OH",8,27,60.0,5.0,2012-04-04,"Whenever we are passing through Columbus, we always make our pit-stop at BJ's Brew-house in Polaris...it is one of our favorites.  The food is creative, eclectic, and most importantly delicious. We always notice how the menu changes over time (that's a good thing, they are creating, updating, and adding seasonal dishes that are welcome and interesting, an ongoing reflection of a proactive kitchen).    I have been there many times for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed with anything that I chose.  My first experience was their pizza. And being a HUGE fan of pizza, I take it seriously when a location has pizza on the menu....It HAS to be good or shouldn't even be offered at all. BJ's scores high marks here. I love their pizzas and they also have flat-bread styles available.   The appetizers are plentiful and very tasty, it's hard to get past them to enjoy the main dishes, they are just so interesting. Salads are generous and satisfying. The entrées, whether lunch or dinner, are amazing and festive, with a good presentation.    Often, the group I am with all chooses differently, then we share. Everyone comments how good the other choices are and noone is disappointed in any way.  The bar options are extensive, and the micro-brewed beers score an A+ for selection and originality.  Also, BJ's is one of the nicest looking casual eateries that you can visit. A true modern American pub.   I'll definitely be visiting over and over again to enjoy their latest creations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=180,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.54,3.88

We has the mini bruschetta (about 5 pieces) for an appetizer, which was under $4. Server was polite, friendly, and knowledegeable of the menu.

182,Joshua C.,"Columbus, OH",13,13,,2.0,2012-05-10,"For the wait and service, the food was fairly mediocre. We went in the middle of the week and it was some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The server was friendly, but absent for 10-15 minutes at a time. Also, the entrees came out 2-3 minutes apart from one another, which was odd. The saving grace was the fantastic hand-crafted root beer and cream soda.

235,Keith B.,"Powell, OH",332,516,72.0,4.0,2012-06-11,"I've been here for lunch and dinner, happy hour for a few beers, and the mixed occasions where you just get an appetizer. They do not fuck up. Some of the food - I'd pass on it - like the ""parmesan crusted chicken sandwich"" - it was a let down, but perhaps it's because it failed to live up to the plated order of parmesan crusted chicken (which is just...delicious, along with the balsamic chicken). For lunch, I recommend only coming in groups of 4 or less to get fast service. Anything larger seems to get you put in the ""hell of wait"" time. And be careful coming at post-lunch shift change - their staff wants to leave after their shift, but they stick around and take care of you. I always try to transfer to the bar at that time so my server can take a well-deserved break (I've been there, and even when they're exhausted, their staff is top-notch). The lunch specials are quite filling, as well, with the chicken teriyaki being a favorite. Simple and delicious. But why do you really come here? For the not-too-shabby craft beer. From the lights to the darks, they do make some tasty brews. From the low-calorie to the high-alcohol content to the dark and heavy stouts - they have a beer for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=100,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.504,3.84

Server was more than inattentive.  Did not clear dishes.  6 of us at a smaller table.  Was there for a birthday celebration so there was a cake in the middle of the table. 3. Asked for extra ice for my warm iced tea.  Took FOREVER to get it. Then, she poured more warm tea on top and melted what little ice I had left. 4.  Several in the party asked for special consideration about their meals.  NONE were honored.  Had to ask several times for the requests to be honored.  These also took FOREVER to get honored. 5.  Asked multiple times for plates to serve the cake. Asked to speak to manager.  He listened to all our problems.  He did not offer ANY discount for the horrible service or the treatment by the hostess.  His solution seemed to be to offer us water refills.  Never said he was sorry either.

While most places that have such extensive menus tend to be mediocre at everything, and have no standout specialties; BJ's manages to do everything very well. My most recent foray saw me with a pot roast open faced sandwich. The meet was very tender, the gravy was absolutely delicious, and the vegetables were fresh and crunchy. I would have liked to see a little bit more bread with this ""sandwich"",but still I found it to be very flavorful tasty.

The place was pretty crowded for being tuesday evening after peak dinner hours, so i took that as a good sign for the quality. The seating was comfortable and the lighting in the two-person booth was just right to see the food but also leave a romantic glimmer in the eye of the person you eat with. Major plus for me. The only strange thing was that the table was clean and prepared, but with the check from the previous diners still on the table. Kinda strange. I ordered the stout, which was really full of flavor and veeeery heavy, which I love. Major points there. For dinner, I had the Mahi-Mahi Tacos, which originally i was concerned it wouldnt be enough at first, only getting two tacos. They had a good filling of Mahi, though and considering the stout and the tortillas/guacamole that came with the tacos, it ended up being the right amount of food.

A quick visit to their website proved that they are in fact, a chain but that they also brew their own beers intrigued us all the same (and it was minutes from our hotel.) It was quiet (on the 4th of July) but we were told we had just missed the lunch rush which would have meant a 20 minute wait. We were quickly greeted by our server who recommended a seasonal brew and left us to check out the menu. We ordered a couple of BJ's beers - the brown for me and the IPA for him and were pleased when they arrived. Pretty decent beer - exceeded my expectations that's for sure. We ordered a pizza and the avocado egg rolls to share. The egg rolls were great - lots of FRESH avocado which got high marks in my book, the pizza was OK.

Pay attention at all points of customer contact. Many patrons had their coats on at their table. Pay attention, it's cold out, and I had to ask you to compensate by turning on the over the door space heaters. ""One is broken, but I will lock the side doors so only the revolving is used"",mgr. The decor was clean, eye catching, and not cluttered.  We were promptly greeted by our server, who suggested drinks, and appetizers. There were no specials, only highlighted, feature items. To keep what was in front of us hot, we ordered in sequence. The dinner salad was nice, but small to share. The house Italian dressing was unexceptionable. The plates to share theses items came from the sever station near the door. Side plates were ice cold. Great for the salad, but not the hot items. The baked lasagna was next. (Note... The menu states it is ravioli) the plump cheese ravioli unbalanced the taste for lasagna. Too much ricotta. The meat marinara was very good. Not Diablo enough for me, but most will find it fresh, and zesty with flavor. Of course, unless we were both going to hover over the same baking pan, I was elected to add my portion to the cold plate. My Valentines gift to you sweetheart. Next came the Tavern Cut Brewhouse Classic pizza. We substituted peppers for mushroom, and added extra sauce based on other comments without complaint. The pizza was GREAT! Many around us had the deep dish. The crust was thin and crispy. The pepperoni was so thin that if it was exposed, it crackled like a chip. The sausage was well seasoned, not a breakfast blend. Of course the cheese was stringy(real), with no imitation snap back. My suggestion would be to ask for extra sauce hot on the side. Their recipe is designed to keep the crust crispy throughout. Then came the Salty Carmel Pizookie. There is nothing more indulgent I can say about this, that has not been said before. I would encourage you to remove the chocolate treat except for the chocolate Pizookie. The manager visited our table, and we shared our visit. I did go back inside to tell our manager Bentley that he should consider shoveling the walk, or at least putting down salt.

It is a huge menu. Huge. On this occasion, we had a bowl of loaded fries (pulled pork, cheese, onion, cilantro) served in a deep dish. They were great. Not too much of anything - just the right amount of everything. Drinks wise I had a pomegranate margarita, with my girlfriend having a spiked Arnold Palmer - it's a great lemon / tea / vodka combo. Margarita was frozen - it separates pretty quick but still delicious. They're great at beer. They have their own brewery - so they have a standard blonde, brunette and a few pales. It's a nice balanced full bar. I enjoyed the pizza here last time, but I went for the half rack of ribs. My partner had the fish tacos - she likes them from here so it's a regular. With the ribs you get chance to choose two sides, I had the horseradish mash and broccoli. The broccoli was perfectly cooked, and the mash just the right amount of cream.  (With the main meal, I switched to a beer called a Nit Wit, it's a whit beer - really tasty). The ribs were coated with rub and BBQ sauce, a little more sauce would be nice, but they were tasty.  Service was great. Friendly and prompt. Never pushy. As always. I'll be back, as I have been before. Always a nice experience.

I think that every time I've been here, someone has brought out the wrong food, our food was taken to the wrong table, or it took us forever to order. Tiny service issues like this are what prevents me from recommending this place to larger groups. For a small group though (especially if you have kids) this place can be fun and the food is perfect. I will also include that the prices are fairly low, and they always say you get what you pay for, so I can't be too angry about the sub par service.

Was disappointed when they brought out a small plain white plate with a very small piece of steak (maybe about a quarter size of the one pictured in the menu), a  few broccoli florets, and a scoop of mashed potatoes that reminded me of the mashed potatoes served with an ice cream scoop in the cafeteria in grade school. They could have at least put a piece of parsley on the plate or something- it all looked so bland. Had a Long Island iced tea for about $10 that was almost entirely ice- what a rip-off. My husband ordered a full rack of ribs with rice pilaf and brussel sprouts, and when I asked him how his food was he said it was ""just okay."" Ordered the triple chocolate cookie with ice cream for dessert, and even though it was shown with vanilla ice cream in the menu it was served with chocolate ice cream & chocolate chips (way too much chocolate! We could eat only a few spoonfuls. And speaking of spoons, the dessert was served with one regular spoon and one soup spoon.) The place was packed while we were there and I have to say I can't understand why; the food & service was mediocre and yet our bill was a whopping $81 without the tip.

My fiancee and I had plans to meet my sister and her husband as they were going to be traveling through the area.  They were set to meet us at the restaurant at around 6:30; my date and I got there at 6:00 after doing some shopping around Polaris.  We were seated rather quickly and put in our requests for drinks.  These came out pretty quick, and at this point it was probably around 6:05.  We didn't see our waiter again for at least 20 minutes, which was unfortunate was we wanted to put in an order for an appetizer.  The waiter finally came back around 6:30 and we placed an order for the calamari, along with ordering drinks for my sister and date as they were close.  The drinks came out quick, and the calamari shortly after they arrived. Sidenote: Calamari was awesome...hot and fresh, melt in your mouth tender. Again, it was about 20-25 minutes until the waiter came back to take our dinner orders. Eventually we ordered.  I should mention that the table behind us (group of 6) and the table on the other side of us (group of 4) were seated right before we placed our dinner orders, and both tables received their food at least ten minutes before we received ours.  Now, what about the food?   My sister ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, and it came out looking just like the menu photo.  She said it was delicious.  Her date ordered the Mediterranean chicken pitas and he said they were tasty as well.  My fiancee got the Jambalaya and she enjoyed it.  Probably worth mentioning that this was a huge portion size and she was happy to have the leftovers later in the evening.  I was trying to decide between the cherry chipotle salmon and the Hawaiian mahi mahi and ended up going with the mahi mahi.  I regretted this decision almost immediately.  While the veggies/rice that accompanied the fish were great (scarfed down with no regrets!), the fish itself was extremely bland.  There was no seasoning on it whatsoever, and definitely no glaze of any kind as the menu indicated.  It seemed to take forever after this to get our check, and we didn't end up getting out of there until a little after 8:00 PM. The waiter we had was extremely polite and courteous; I feel as though he may have simply forgot about us a few times.  I'm hoping this was just a fluke as I feel that this place had the potential to blow me away.  I'd like to try it again in the future; I just hope it's a slightly better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=100,3.76,3.68,3.68,2.9200000000000004,3.712

Upon arrival the hostess had no idea we had called back. We were seated promptly however. Ordered drinks and appetizer which we got. Ordered our entrees which included salads and waited for over an hour and received nothing further. The manager came over and asked if everything was ok we informed him we had been waiting for over and hour. He went to investigate and found the ""kitchen had lost our ticket"" even though the waitress had a walked passed our table at least ten times to serve other people while we waited. The manager brought our food and it was good but after waiting so long it really didn't matter. We then were the ""focus table"" as different managers came to check on us however we still had to wait for drink refills etc and the waitress seemed to be afraid to come back to our table. although we never verbalized our displeasure to her. We were offered a free dessert but had to wait on that as well so it was little compensation for our experience. I have been a chef for over 20 years and I can forgive a lot in a restaurant because I know the business. However when you are passed by countless times by people who know you should have been served that is kind of inexcusable.

Prior to getting carry out food at BJ's a couple days ago, I went to another restaurant to get carry out food and not only got rude service while I was waiting for my food, but got home and my order wasn't even right. I called the restaurant to speak with a manager and was on hold for 12 minutes. This kind of service is incredibly off-putting and rude. This is why I should've just ordered from BJ's to begin with. I ordered my food online, with the super easy to use BJ's app. I was greeted immediately upon walking up to the carry out window, and got excellent service as always! Lesson learned!

37,Dave W.,"Galena, OH",54,4,11.0,1.0,2016-02-05,"Tonight we went to BJ's for the first time. We used their app to be put on the wait list (60 minute wait) so by the time we got to the restaurant we only had a 5 minute wait. I liked the atmosphere of the place but that ended up being the highlight. When we were seated the host suggested the Brisket Burger or the Club. He said the Brisket Burger was huge, about 3/4 of a pound and with all the other toppings it was almost a full pound.  So our server arrived and asked about drinks. I ordered one of their in house made beers only to be told they were all out of that one. No big deal so I ordered an iced tea instead. After a few minutes he came back to take our order. I decided to take the hosts suggestion and ordered the brisket burger, my daughter ordered the roast beef dip and my wife was trying to decide between the brisket burger and the balsamic chicken. The server asked how hungry she was and that the brisket burger was a lot of food. She opted for the chicken but upon hearing this I was getting excited to see this thing.  When they brought the food out (by a runner) my burger was the size of a something from the dollar menu at McDonalds but on a huge bun. After I looked at this I motioned for the server and asked what was the deal that this pathetic piece of meat wasn't anywhere close to what both he and the host described. With out saying a word, he took it away. I thought he was going to reorder it and that somebody just screwed up in the kitchen.  A few minutes later another person (I am assuming he was a manager) came to the table and informed us that their burgers are a 5 ounce pattie. That is a big difference from 3/4 pound that the host said actually it is nearly a half pound of difference. What really took the cake was when he asked if I wanted to order something else or if I was set. WTF, I waited an hour before getting there, then when they brought out the food I didn't take the first bite and now your asking if I am all set. By this point I was starved.  So he brought back a menu and I quickly decided on the Texas fried steak. He took my order and 10 minutes later my dinner was served. Of course my wife and daughter had finished their meals by now. I don't know if this was their normal meat or they just pulled the worst chunk they had for a customer that already had complained but this was tough, gristly and had almost no flavor. I didn't want to wait again so I decided to just deal with it and cut around the inedible parts. I guess that was a good plan since the server never bothered to come back to ask how my dinner was.  He brought the check and while I wasn't looking for a comp or discount etc, I would have thought an apology or at least acknowledgment of the situation was in order. I guess I was wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=40,3.52,3.61,3.61,2.8520000000000003,3.5740000000000003
178,Angelica R.,"Columbus, OH",136,3,,3.0,2016-02-24,"This was my first time at BJ's. I was there with 4 of my girlfriends for happy hour which ran until 7. When we got there, we wanted to sit in the bar area which is the only area they honor the happy hour deals but the tables were full. We then got seated in the restaurant and asked our server (Julie S) if she would honor the happy hour deal at the table in which she agreed was totally fine. Most of us ordered before 7 p.m. When we received our bill, 4 of us should have had at least one glass of wine discounted and 2 of us needed another $5 off for the mini pizza's we ordered. I then politely told the server what the issue was and she immediately got an attitude and told us that there was nothing her or the manager could do because the computer ""turns off the happy hour deals at 7."" I reminded her that we had all of those orders in before 7. So she grabbed the checks and took them to her manager.  The manager came to the table and without introducing himself, said he heard there was a problem with our bills. I said, ""Yeah, we were just missing a few discounts from the happy hour."" He then rudely proceeded to tell us that he can't change the bill once it has been processed. Being that we all work in restaurants as servers, we knew that was not true at all. He brought back all of our checks with $5 taken off of all of them. This is not what we wanted at all, we just wanted the ones that needed to be fixed, fixed. It was very offensive of him to basically just give us all the $5 off to get us out of there.  Manager definitely needs some customer service training and Julie needs to work on her people skills as well as facial expressions when working in this industry.

One thing I like about BJ's is they have so much variety of foods and drinks. From burger to pasta, and other special cocktails and taps, it is hard to get bored with their menu. The food didn't take too long to arrive after we placed our order. However, they brought out the wrong food for one of my friend. While my friend waiting for his food to come out, the manager came back and apologize for the mistake. He also offer a soup on the house. The management handled the situation exceptionally well for their staff mistakes! The portion of their food is pretty huge. I like their Jambalaya because of the amount of different ingredients that they used [Grill chicken and shrimp, sausage, green pepper...] The only thing is they are pretty oily. Spaghetti and Meatballs is way too spicy. So please be cautious if you cannot handle spicy food. We spend like quite some time in the restaurant chit-chatting.

That was above and beyond regular service in my opinion. The vanilla cream soda is so good that we'll even make a stop at the restaurant just to get a cup to-go now and nothing else. As for the food, I've had several items, but I always keep coming back to the New Orleans Jambalaya. It definitely has some heat, so it's not for the faint of heart if you can't handle spice.

It was way louder than it should have been. I jumped almost ten feet in the air because it scared me so much. Next, My friend ordered a burger and the whole thing was Burnt because the waiter didn't even bother to ask how he would like it cooked. We also had to ask every time we needed a refill. That is something you shouldn't have to ask for, it's the waiters responsibility to do that task.

Two of them didn't come until after most of us were done eating.  One was a child's pizza that they said came out bad. I'll bet they forgot to order it like the other meal. We repeatedly needed to ask for condiments and things already asked for on meals originally. One meal came out with meat that the person asked to have no meat on cause she was allergic. So she didn't even eat.  After leaving three of us had to go get other food somewhere else.  We blame most of this on the server as he seemed like he didn't care about his job. But who knows.  Maybe it's he kitchen staff as well.  I went to the manager at the end and she had just been notified of the situation. They did take care of the meal.

58,Jim H.,"Westerville, OH",26,336,45.0,3.0,2017-07-03,"This is my 3rd review of BJ's and while I continue to be a fan of this restaurant, I think they need to ""up their game"" a little and pay more attention to details.  First -- the good news -- they do order ""wait list seating"" which is similar to the call-ahead seating used by other restaurants. For anyone who has dined at any of the Polaris Parkway restaurants on a Friday or Saturday night can tell you -- wait list seating is a big plus. Our most recent visit was on a Saturday night and it was a disappointing experience.  My wife and I both ordered salads - mine was a tomato / mozzaella salad and my wife's was a ""house salad.  Mine was fine but her salad was served without ANY dressing.  When we called this to the waitresses' attention, she was very apologetic and immediately headed back for the dressing.  It was at least 5 minutes before the dressing was served.  Then, we both ordered burgers,  I requested mine to be cooked medium (my default for burgers and ground beef); my wife asked for hers be be medium well (NO PINK in the center).  Well -- my burger was closer to medium well but was still acceptable to me but my wife's burger was definitely medium RARE as opposed to medium WELL - nice an pink and juicy in the middle.  AGAIN, the waitress was very apologetic and she took my wife's burger back to the kitchen.  She stopped at the table 2 or 3 times to tell us that the burger would be ""RIGHT OUT"" but -- in reality - it took well over 10 minutes for my wife to get a new burger -- while my burger got cold. Finally - when we thought we had seen everything -- we got our check and discovered that we had been DOUBLE-CHARGED for my wife's burger. AGAIN - MORE APOLOGIES - and a revised check. Overall -- the food was excellent (once we get what we ordered).  The waitress was very professional, very polished and pleasant and -- in normal circumstances - I would have said she was an excellent waitress. But with 3 major screw-ups, I have to think she bears some of the responsibility. Based on tonight's overall experience, I can't rate BJ's any higher than a 3-star - despite the quality of their food and their generally decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus,3.6,3.59,3.59,3.2440000000000007,3.5940000000000003

28,Lauren L.,"Sparks, NV",0,15,,1.0,2017-07-17,Went here the food was good! Service was a little slow but it was late and I'm sure they were tired! Was charged on my credit card a little over double!? Spoke with GM who kindly refunded my money and a some extra but I was totally under the impression it wasn't a big! Look at your bank statement after it clears! I was told the manager should have told me my card was charged for someone else's check and they tried to cancel it. Kinda scary!!! If I didn't catch this would they have?? Could have been extra money for the business!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=40,3.52,3.57,3.57,2.9800000000000004,3.5500000000000003
36,Miranda H.,"Columbus, OH",25,9,,4.0,2017-07-17,Food was great however the waiter was slightly rude. I felt rushed a little. Maybe we caught her on a bad day?

19,Wendy G.,"Dublin, OH",0,6,,2.0,2017-07-23,"Used to love this place. It it has really gone downhill... Went with my husband and two friends last night - the place wasn't even that busy. Took 10 minutes to get our drinks and about 20 or so minutes to get our food.  I ordered the spaghetti and it was slimy and cold... clearly had just been sitting out waiting. The waitress was nowhere to be found so I ate a small portion and just dealt with it.  Once our checks came, we set the card our immediately and several minutes later she came to get them and then took another 10-15 minutes to bring them back. We allotted an hour and 40 minutes for dinner before a movie we wanted to see just around the corner and because of the delays we were aost late. Crazy... please up the quality of your staff... $42 for a mediocre meal and subpar service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus?start=20,3.44,3.55,3.55,,3.5060000000000002

Alcoholic drinks, especially their bloody mary's were terrific. Wife's long island ice tea was perfect. Best beginnings sample was a wide variety of different appetizers..all prepared perfectly. Flatbread was terrific as well as the root beer glazed ribs. Son's pizza was hot and prepared as ordered.

Hubby got the pulled pork, which had hard pieces in it. Lastly, the wine was to be 50% off on Wine Down Tuesday but it didn't automatically get marked down.

I like consistent food cooking & portions. This place gets it done. I always sub sides which is easily done and I've never had a hard time doing it. Good in house beer selection and I always go for the BJ' Brewhouse Blonde. Even during peak hours the wait usually isn't terrible. It's a decent size and good for work groups or just a night out.

Not all of the flavors are offered in the sampler, but there's still a great selection. We had the cookies and cream, peanut butter, and macadamia nut. My favorite is the cookies and cream, it's a chocolate cookie but it's not too rich, I found the macadamia nut to be too sweet, and the peanut butter is always delicious. The peanut butter has real full sized peanuts in it, not my favorite part, but FYI.
