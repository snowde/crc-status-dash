My first clue about what the food would be like was seeing two thirds of the men hunched over their plates while wearing their ball caps indoors. The women were blond, real and otherwise, loud and over weight. TVs all over with the Pittsburg-Denver game on. So, what to eat? I went with the chicken fried steak thinking that would be one of the better dishes. The gravy was peppery and covered only half of the steak.But, the server brought more for me to pour. The spuds were fine, nothing special, A's were the steamed veggies. The service was very good and earned my two stars and a decent tip. I might give this chain another chance, if my only other choice was a Applebees or a Mickey D's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=540,2.88,3.13,3.076,2.3760000000000003,3.03

Burger was broken into two pieces and way overcooked (no one asked how I wanted it done)  Someone arrived at our table delivering our side of fries which we did not order - and looked at us as if we were crazy when we looked bewildered. The manager came over and gave us a long song and dance about how the corporation is great and personall oversaw the redoing of my burger and IT WAS WORSE than the 1st one.  They did not charge us for the burger but I will likely never go here again.  There are a least two places (not corporate) restaurants near by that serve great burger at way better prices (Chef Burger on Golf Club Rd & El Tapatio on Golf Club Rd - they have great mexican food AND great burger and steak sandwich) Take my advise and go local and stay away from BJs!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=840,2.84,3.1,3.06,2.34,2.9960000000000004

When she arrived we ordered soup as appetizers and she asked if we want it out at the same time as our dinner. We politely asked for it first.  Our soup was served from another waiter and was so good. The soup was served with a waiter who likes his job. Not even two minutes later our dinner was out of the kitchen. Why ask if y our not going to listen. Asked for no tomatoes and still had tomatoes. I know people have off days and we are human, I did only take off one star. Also, we only saw her to place our order and drop off the check. No polite, is there anything i can get you, till she dropped off the check. And they were not that busy, Thursday night at six.

First of all, I went in about 15 minutes before my family got there so I got a reservation and I let the hostess know that there was going to be 7 of us. She gave me a buzzer thing and told me to let them know when they get here. When my cousins got there, they told us they had a table ready for us but it was only able to seat 6 people. Clearly, I told the hostess there was going to be SEVEN of us. So we had to wait an additional 10 minutes which wasn't so bad. Another host gave me another buzzer and told us it would go off when a bigger table was available. When the buzzer finally went off I gave it to the original hostess who was assisting me and my family and she looked confused and didn't know what was going on. So i explained to her that another host gave me a NEW buzzer. She then made us wait an additional 15 minutes. When we finally get seated, they put us OUTSIDE secluded from everyone. The heaters were not strong enough, and it was cold. Our first waitress was nice although she seemed like she hated her job. After her shift was over, she then introduced us to another server who would be assisting us for the rest of the evening.

She seemed distracted the entire time and when she did manage to come to our table she was looking around and not focusing on us. Her relief David was great.

936,Elena T.,"Dublin, CA",0,91,,1.0,2012-04-09,"I LOVE BJ's. I come here all the time and have been to this location close to 20 times. I love that no matter what I am in the mood for, it's probably on their menu and good. We always have great service, even when it's crowded. Until yesterday. So it's Easter Sunday. Our party of 6 gets there when the doors open at 10. We are the only party there. we sit down. our waitress with long black hair in 2 braids, takes our drink order (all sodas.) Just from that interaction, I had a bad feeling. She didn't seem all there or to know what she was doing or something. About 10 minutes go by and no one has drinks. A party of 2 has since come in. That's it...our party of 6 and the party of 2 in the entire restaurant. She was no where to be found. She finally comes back. one person ordered a regular soda, the rest are all diet. She stares at the platter of drinks and says ""Oh..usually i put 2 straws in the diet to tell it apart from regular but I guess I didn't, so we'll have to guess."" Then she realizes as she is setting them on the table  that she put 2 straws in the regular. um..??? it's been like 5 minutes since you filled the glasses. She walks away-and SHOCKING-the regular soda is also a diet. REALLY? So 3 of us order from the breakfast menu (2 french toasts and a breakfast pizza) and 3 order from the regular lunch menu. so we wait. Finally 4 of our meals come out. The 3 lunch menu items and one order of french toast. so we all wait to start eating until everyone is served..and we wait...and there is no syrup or butter on the plate or table for the french toast either. Finally our oh so bright waitress shows up with the breakfast pizza and sees us all looking around and says 'whats the problem?"" Um..we still are short a plate and my dad asks for butter and syrup.  ""Oh.."" she says. So she disappears into the kitchen and gets the other french toast. meanwhile-the rest of us have been waiting for all of us to be served, so now ALL of our food is cold. By this time, one other party of 4 is in the restaurant. So 12 customers in the restaurant...and this crappy of service? after she sets the last plate down, she says ""is there STILL a problem?"" My dad said ""I still don't have butter or syrup for my french toast."" She SIGHS and goes back to the kitchen like she is put out. Are you KIDDING? she brings back a syrup and butter for my dad that ordered french toast-but NOTHING for the other person that ordered the same thing. Who eats french toast without syrup and butter? That would just be warm bread! why doesn't it come on the plate instead of asking for it?  By this time, we were all so irritated with the cold food and crappy service, that the person that got NO butter, just gave up and did without. NICE! We are very generous tippers, and I have to say, this was one of the rare times i  didn't even want to leave a standard 20%. Our family Easter brunch was a total wash. we all left shaking our heads. Not sure if i will go back. if i do, and i am seated in her section, I will ask to be moved. And by the way, when we left, there were still only about 20 customers in the whole place.

760,Meena P.,"Concord, CA",2,61,,1.0,2012-05-22,"So this place has steadily gone down hill!  Hubby and i went for dinner on a Friday night a week ago. I use to love BJ's restaurant. So it being a Friday night, it was plenty busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table. It took forever for our waitress to come to us. She said she was swamped as they had just sat 3 tables in her area and she already had a full house.  Ok, no problem. We ordered a cesear's salad, large veggie pizza and drinks. So this time since we had so much time while waiting for service, I started reading the menu. I read that the veggie pizza comes on their whole wheat crust - Aha!  The previous time we came here I asked my server if our pizza was on whole wheat crust (again it was a veggie) and he assured us that it was not. I had my doubt as it tasted sweet and not like the usual crust.  So, now after reading the menu I realized that our last waiter did lie to us about the crust.  So this time I made sure to request the white crust.  I find the whole wheat crust quite gross, it's so sweet and pizza crust in my opinion should not be sweet! Anyway, we got our salad and it was half the size it normally is so I asked the waitress if they had changed their portions and she said no that this was a side salad. Hubby and I were sharing the salad but the portion turned out to be fine. We got our pizza and it was ugly. It literally looked like the chef (and I use that term loosely) had just thrown our toppings on the pizza, not only that it looked like in the cutting they first cut it wrong and then tried to correct it. It was the ugliest pizza. there were areas without sauce or toppings just cheese.   I should have complained to the waitress but we barely got any service.

We arrived at 7pm for a party of 8 and used their call ahead service to put our name on the list before we arrived.  Once we arrived and checked in, they told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  An hour later, our buzzer goes off and we go to get seated.  They take us straight to a table outside--but never asked if we had a preference and just assumed we would be okay with it.  We were not.  There were people smoking outside near the patio area and it was pretty chilly.  We were then taken back inside and told we would be put back on the top of the list for the next available table inside that could seat 8 people.  They didn't give us an estimated time of how much longer it would be, but just told us they have been waiting for another table to leave who had been there for almost 2 hours.  FINALLY, we were seated...inside--almost 2 HOURS since our arrival.  There were no free appetizers given, barely an apology--instead they just blamed it on the other table taking 2 hours before freeing up a table for us.  Once we got to the table, our service from our server wasn't the best either.  He took a while to get us waters, and once he brought them, he didn't even bring enough for the whole table.  We finally ordered our food, they forgot a salad that was ordered and it just took forever to get anything accomplished.   In addition, there was a large spill right next to our table and it seemed as though we were more worried about getting someone to clean it up, than the management was.  We put down a napkin on the spill, so no one would slip and eventually someone came to clean it up. We were at BJ's for a total of 3.5 hours for dinner.  Absolutely RIDICULOUS for a Friday night dinner.  The food was delicious, but the service made the experience, less than appealing.

The salads were a bit too tart for our taste and the baby back ribs were dry!!! The worst part was that I had my 3 year old son's food didn't come out until everyone else was done with their meals! We ended up feeding him from our plates. By the time his food came he didn't want it anymore! The server stated that someone stole his plate off of the food line! Really?

That was a little whack, but my group of girlfriends already agreed to meet here for a birthday dinner.  FOOD - Portabella mushroom pizza: I love the strong woodsy taste of the mushrooms, but everything else was a bit lacking. I wish I tasted the basalmic vinegar sauce a bit more. - Mediterranean pizza: This one actually packed a punch of flavor! Kalamata olives, peppers, feta cheese...my friend got this one and I nibbled on it a bit. Will order this next time. - Stuffed mushrooms: a very delicious appetizer full of mushroomy, cheesy, garlicky goodness DRINKS Okay the big plus of all BJs? They have a full bar! I loved the Very Berry margarita...it was almost like an alcoholic smoothie. My friend had the Pink Cadillac--I would highly recommend if you are into citrusy drinks. SERVICE Stars come off for this section...we were scooted into a booth and it took over 15 minutes for someone to ask us about drinks! Another 15 mins passed before we got them. And our appetizers were served first without any utensils. How did they expect us to eat stuffed mushrooms without a fork? Waiting for the check took a bit longer too, although we requested it to be split in 4. ATMOSPHERE I'm used to the roominess of the Brentwood location. The aisles in this Concord spot is very awkward and narrow. It's hard to navigate to the back of the restaurant for bathroom without asking other patrons to scoot in. Talk about a traffic jam when another customer or waiter walks towards you in the opposite direction. CONCLUSION Decent place to meet up with friends for drinks; food is A-OK; I would check out other eateries in the mall or by Willow Pass Road if you want a more intimate gathering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=260,2.8,2.89,3.004,2.54,2.854

B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Parking lot gets full because of the mall, BJ's and 24 hour fitness -- This is one of the ""smaller"" BJ's so it gets packed quick -- HUGE menu like cheesecake factory -- Specializes in beer and pizza but offers a lot more -- Lots of TV's to watch sports and a bar, of course -- Happy Hour is always a win here -- Not personally a fan of their deep dish or new hand toss thin crust -- Thin cut fries or wedge fries, no regular fries -- Service is hit or miss depending on your server -- Soup in their breadbowls are BOMB (most people don't even know about them) -- Calamari was very good, fresh & the tartar sauce was the best -- Most entree' portions are HUGE -- Save room for a pizookie for dessert! (I prefer the glutten-free) I would have to say that BJ's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love pizza but rarely do I eat it here. Instead I'm eating their appetizers like calamari or chicken wings (they also do boneless - not bad either), their chili or tomato bisque in a their delicious bread bowl, or a burger. I actually prefer their calzones over their pizza, go figure! Last weekend, I could not pass up the offer to try their new hand tossed thin crust pizza. From the description and the photo it looked like a hand tossed pizza crust but when it came out it felt more like a crispy flat bread pizza. It also sucked that it wasn't cut very well so I had to hacksaw it with my dull butter knife. Despite the crust, the pizza toppings and flavors were all there. I ended up with the new chicken bacon ranch and subbed spinach for tomatoes. It was a decent pizza but I will not be ordering the hand tossed again. Before we had our entree's we tried their calamari. It was very good and fresh but I wanted to mention how great the tartar sauce was. It was the best tartar sauce I have ever ate. It was very fresh and refreshing. It completely balanced the fried calamari. We finished it in no time. I always find it hard to believe that some people have not heard of BJ's famous pizookie. It's a small circle pan with whatever choice of cookie you choose served hot with ice cream on top. I've started to prefer the glutten free option because it's a lot lighter but still has all the flavor as the original pizookie. Don't miss out on this awesome dessert! I wish I would have remembered our server's name. He was seriously the best server we have ever had. There were moment when we needed him but he had that ""spider"" sense and would show up when we needed him. We were very please with the meal and makes me wish the San Bruno location was more like this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=520,2.96,2.77,2.976,2.416,2.846

Well, Big Joe was right.  It's more of a restaurant.  Sorta loud, like a place were you go hang out with the boys after work, or a girls night out with margaritas.  Not bad for kids, and they have a kids menu.  Similar to what I've heard about Hooters, this atmosphere is better than it looks. It looks like the bar takes up the entire long side of the wall;  I could be wrong on that.  But the drinks are stacked in shelves all the way to near the top of the high ceiling.  And the first five pages of the menu are their drinks.  Yep, they take their beer seriously, not too good for a non-alky like me. Food looks kinda uppercrusty, with prices to match.  Both my wife and I had chicken-fried steak, came with lots of vegetables;  I wasn't impressed.  We had to wait a long time to be seated, so I guess people come here for some reason other than the food.  Then the bill came - and the dollars-off coupon wasn't included!

I was with my wife and good friend with beer at the table and awaiting the arrival of an amazing burger. After a reasonable amount of time, I was served some irrelevant sandwich- the same kind your weird Italian roommate would make in between football and a bizarre laundry ritual. I was not too disappointed at this point, and after some contemplation decided to send it back to get the real burger that I desired. After watching the people who I love enjoy their meals, my burger arrived. This time the meat was not thoroughly cooked as the pink was so bright it was as if they were mocking me. I felt so badly for sending it back a second time, because usually I just take what I'm given even with mistakes. It was simply not edible- I did not go there to enjoy raw meat. The manager came to the table to apologize, and she seemed sincere but I feel it was façade. I understand that being a manager of a restaurant and brewery is demanding, and I would feel the same. After all it wasn't her fault. But to express my experience at this restaurant, it was not worth what we paid, and to make multiple mistakes on one order is simply not acceptable. When it comes down to it, the Wendys in Fremont is so much more superior. Their Frosty's are impeccable, and the burgers are amazingly delicious without being overpriced.

BJ's uses an outside company to administer its frequent customer rewards program and this restaurant frequently fails to do what it needs to do to give guests the reward points they've earned for eating/drinking there.  When a guest notices the problem and complains, sometimes the restaurant fixes the mistake but it usually takes more than 10 minutes to do it.  Even worse, sometimes the management tries to blame it on the outside company and is not sincerely apologetic.  I think this restaurant is extremely lucky.  Much of its success is due to its prime location at the Sunvalley Mall.

The flatbread was very tasty, although the toppings were very uneven - an oversight that was easily rectified.  Then we were served our main course.  I love chicken fried steak, and eat it only on very rare occasions and dug in with gusto. The breading was beautiful, dark golden and crispy. I took a bite and paused tasting . . . . nothing. I added some salt and pepper - still nothing.  When our waiter came back, I explained the situation to him. He was immediately apologetic, offered us an alternative entree, and assured us that he would ask the manager to ""take care of it.""

They use a lot of bread on the pizza, unless you get the flat, rectangular ones which are my favorites.  Service is always great here, and I never noticed the long waiting for food time, because most of the time I'm just too busy with the beer, watching TV, or having a great conversation. So a really nice place to chill, but not if you're in a hurry.

Major disappointment!  We had to wait another half hour for dessert.  Bummer!    DRINKS: Piranha Pint -- $5.25 Pale ale Lightswitch Lager Pint -- $5.25  Malt flavored light beer Strawberry Margarita -- $9.50  Made of Ketel One Vodka and strawberries. Strawberry Splash -- $9.25  Made of Grey Goose Vodka, Disaronno Amaretto, Piña Colada and Strawberry Puree.  I am not into alcoholic drinks, but I was able to appreciate this cocktail.   FOOD: Best Beginnings -- $16.95  Consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  Excellent for sharing.  However, if it were just me and my husband, we would have shied away from the sampler and just picked the avocado spring roll. Pizookie Trio -- $9.50  We ordered the red velvet, chocolate chunk, and white chocolate macadamia.  The white chocolate macadamia was the best of the three.  It was as good as I remembered it.  The other two flavors were disappointing.  They were too sweet for my taste.   We should have just gone white chocolate macadamia all the way.    BILL:  Our total bill without tax was $60.71.  That's not bad for a party of four. We could have saved 50% if we didn't order drinks.  Word to the wise, go during happy hour if you want to save on drinks...duh!   :)  VERDICT:  Be prepared to wait forever for your food to arrive.  However, if you have lots of time to kill, then you'll feel right at home here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=240,2.6,2.7,2.912,2.572,2.66

CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Epic and delicious, made super special by their unique presentation.  You receive a large soup bowl filled with the chicken, chips, cheese and other goodies, and the soup is poured by your server over all the goodies from a little kettle.  It really preserves the integrity of the chips and cheese, nothing arrives soggy.  I was very impressed.   BLACK & BLEU FLATBREAD - A really good portion of yummy steak and blue cheese in pizza form - brilliant!   PORTABELLO/BALSAMIC DEEP DISH PIZZA- Doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore which is a shame, because this was EPIC.  Sitting at the bar with a glass of good wine, chatting with good company and munching on this pizza -  life doesn't get much better.  BRING IT BACK!!   ENLIGHTENED HAWAIIAN MAHI-MAHI - So tasty!  While you definitely know you're eating a healthy dish compared with all the French fries and cheese that will be all around you, there is no shortage of yum on this plate of food.  I loved it! BBQ BISON BURGER (from the Enlightened menu) - Wonderful!  Delicious perfectly seasoned and well cooked burger patty, topped with pico de gallo, roasted pepper, with a side of slaw.  Tastier than their regular burgers, seriously! And of course, Pizookies!  The original, gluten-free and triple chocolate are all SO good, super indulgent and enough for I'd say 4 people to have a good couple bites.  Seriously one of the best dessert options in any restaurant I could name in the area.

We asked to change tables and they were debating it with themselves. Another older couple sat on the same table after us and they just plain left. Plus they served us piping hot food and left us staring at it without utensils for, what seemed like, forever. Complete torture. FOOD Soup of the Day - Clam Chowder. Flavors were good, but it was incredibly salty. Unbearably salty. Inedibly salty! I was super hungry so I finished it with all of my oyster crackers. My dinner date agreed that it was way too salty and did not want anymore of it. Baby Back Ribs, full rack. SO DELISH! Perfectly cooked ribs. They were moist and finger lickin'! I was super full and I still ate a couple more ribs because reheating it wouldn't do it justice. My only complaint is that they didn't sauce it enough while cooking. A couple of ribs on the ends didn't even touch BBQ sauce. I'm not a big BBQ sauce fangirl, but at least a smidgen of it is needed on ribs! Potato Skin. Probably one of the better potato skins that I've had. It's cut into small segments (I hate them when they're way too big to eat) and pops right into your mouth!

I guess it is true-when you try to be good at everything, you are rarely good at anything.. Sit at the bar, enjoy a cold one. they have multiple happy hours throughout the day.

I was greeted by the hostess who asked me if I wanted to sick in the cocktail lounge because it's open seating. I tell her no, just a regular table and her attitude seemed to change from happy to not so happy. But I was seated pretty much right away. While I was waiting for Terri to come in our server Chris brought us both water. I noticed both the drink menu and the table were a little sticky. Finally Terri comes in and we place our orders. She ordered the Bison burger which was on there under 600 calories menu and I had the jalapeno burger cooked rare. Thank god it was actually cooked rare, I believe this is only the fifth place I've tried that have successfully cooked my burger the way I want it. The fried jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese with the spicy mayo gave it a great kick. However it was very uneven. Some bites would have the full spicy bite, and others would have no kick to it at all.  Instead of getting fries I decided to go with a dinner salad. It was OK but I've had better salads in less popular places. One thing I hate is whole tomato slices in a salad. I tried Terri's Bison burger and it was amazing. I would love to have switched but I knew that wasn't happening, haha. For dessert we ordered the triple sampler of Pazookie. Awesome stuff. We had the original which was a warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream on top, raspberry and white chocolate cookie with vanilla bean ice cream, and red velvet  cake cookie with vanilla bean ( my personal favorite.) Our server was Chris and he was very good, saying yes sir, no sir, very polite young man. One thing though is after he would ask a question, or after we answer one, he would stand and stare for a second and then walk away. I tried there Piranha ale, and it was delicious.

Toppings good and fresh. Beer good and when I couldn't make up my mind on which one to choice they brought me 2 samples to try. (nice touch). The management just needs to remind the young workers to make an extra effort to clear empty glasses and plates, make sure there are napkins & utensils on the table (or at least bring them after seating.

I just finally asked myself, ""Why do you keep coming back?!""  I guess because it's a big enough place and noisy enough, that the kids like it... but it is just a tough place to bring kids- because of the LONG WAIT!  Always a long wait, for everything! We usually try to go in off peak times, so we dont wait more than 15 mins for a seat... so that's fine. But it takes forever to get a menu, place your order, even LONGER for the food to come, and forever to get your check and get out. Seriously people-- what is wrong with you guys?!  We went in (myself, a girlfriend and our kids-- 6 of us in total) and our food took about 30-40 mins to come out. And we didn't even order that crazy of stuff. Just some appetizers and 4 kids meals (which the kids meals were horrible!) All in all, just a bummer. The table next to us sat piled high with dirty dishes the entire time we were there (about 90 minutes!) and I saw tons of staff just standing around. The table behind us asked for silverware 2 or 3 times before they finally brought it-- all the while their food sitting there in front of them getting cold. Even when I asked, 'when is our food coming- the kids are getting restless'... our waitress said, ""should be soon- you know, they can go run around out on the patio"" and pointed to their outdoor dining area. Yeah- like I'm gonna let my kids go run around and bother the diners out there --even if there were only a few? Plus, my little one is LITTLE... I cant just send her off to run and play.  That wasn't the point-- the point was - what's taking so long to make a salad and reheat some gross mac n' cheese?! It really was gross, all clumped together and oily.  I'm done.

Waiters white shirt was a mess. I inquired and he said he made a big batch of tea and spilled. Funny, it didn't look like tea, but I believed him. His apron had white stuff all over too. I wouldn't have thought much more of it, but we were seated next to the window and 30 minutes later, I noticed another employee parked in the very first parking spot (aren't they supposed to leave the good spots for customers?), get out of her car. From a distance I noticed her shirt wasn't clean and as she walked past the window while tying her apron, I could see her apron was filthy. I can't believe management allows that. Things do get spilled in a food business and I assume there are extra shirts and clothing just in case. How can you allow an employee to start a shift looking filthy?  That is unacceptable. I'm still considering speaking with a manager, but I doubt it will make a difference. I had to wait so long to pay after asking, that I don't think they care anymore.

Above all though this is a beer place and they need to get this right because I am a beer guy and I went here for beer. I am like Benjamin Blue of Forrest Gump fame except I go on and on about beer rather than shrimp. I was happy to see they had a tap of Pilsner Urquell. I ordered a pitcher, but when it came 35 minutes later it was a pitcher of IPA. Not a bad IPA but not what I was looking forward to. I told the waitress a mistake had been made. Twenty minutes later she brought me another pitcher of the same IPA. I told her the wrong keg must be connected to the Pilsner Urquell tap and settled down to drink a pitcher of IPA. A second waitress/assistant manager came by and asked me about it. I told her the kegs were likely crossed and she said she would check on it. Thirty minutes we flagged the second waitress down to ask about the kegs. She reports the bartender reported to her that the kegs were connected correctly. Here I sit with the aftertaste of American hops on my tongue and the feeling of grief that a perfectly good second pitcher of IPA or possibly a strong Pale Ale had to be poured down the drain.

Instead my party was met with a fairly busy restaurant (so much for an early and quick dinner) and really inattentive service. It took quite a long time for our order to be taken and then half way through our meal the server went home for the night. The server that took her place seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had to attend to.  We ordered salads and entrees and asked if we should order our pizookies for dessert when we placed our order. The initial waitress said we didn't need to order a dessert ahead of time, so we didn't feel too worried. I ordered a wedge salad and a gluten free pizza.  Our server didn't bring our salads. The person who brought our salads placed each salad in front of the wrong person.  The lettuce was crisp, but the tomatoes weren't ripe. The entrees took a long time to arrive and when they did, the same thing happened with the salad...all placed in front of the wrong person...and to top it off they didn't bother to take away our dirty salad plates.  We sat there for some time before we finally tracked down our server to place our dessert order (after considering going somewhere else for dessert because of the slow service). I ordered a gluten free pizookie. The dirty salad dishes finally disappeared but our dirty entree dishes remained (why?!?).  The pizookies arrived and my table mates was so undercooked the manager removed it from the bill (thank you).  With that said, we were there for TWO hours. Two hours?!? Why?!? service was sooooo slow. We should have just ordered our pizookies at the beginning - not sure that would have helped, however.  I should also mention that we came in for a girls night out to celebrate three birthday's. I told the original server when we placed our order and even told the second/replacement server when she took our pizookie order. None of us received a candle or a howdy'do.  I mainly chose this restaurant because of the gluten free pizza and gluten free pizookie. I'd been to the Reno and Roseville locations and had a great experience at both.

Before the server, Jonathan, could get out, 2-3 more tables had been sat after we had sat on the patio for all this time alone other than another couple who was already finished and just hanging out.  Jonathan FINALLY shows up and proceeds to take all the orders around us and was heading back in until I spoke up. The service went even worse from there. My beer comes in a warm glass so it was barely cold when I did finally receive it. By now, the patio is filled up. 30 minutes go by and not a word from the server. Other tables around us were getting their food who had arrived and ordered after us. I ask about our food from another server who had brought items to other surrounding tables. She finally finds our food and my girls' burgers weren't even hot and my son's macaroni and cheese was a big blob with the top crusted over and dry from sitting under the heat lamps too long. Disgusting. He barely ate it and just had apple sauce. I would have sent it back but I doubted that we wold have ever seen it again so poor thing, he just ate what he could of it. My girls picked at their burgers and left most of it on the plate.  Jonathan's customer service skills leave A LOT to be desired and if I was sat in his section again, if I ever go there again - which will be a LONG time - I would ask to be moved.  Drinks didn't get refilled until we were literally minutes away from leaving. I had to ask for my bill and we waited 10 minutes for Jonathan to return with it so we could leave. I spent $50 for a horrible dinner and even worse customer service. For the money you spend at BJ's, do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Their service is ALWAYS, notoriously slow but this was ridiculous. I definitely feel like I got robbed of my $50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=840,2.64,2.7,2.872,2.148,2.676

367,Adri A.,"Hercules, CA",358,53,88.0,1.0,2013-08-14,"NOPE. I used to think that this place was all right. Y'know, your typical 'eh, I'm not expecting much' chain restaurant. Now it's like 'oh man what is this?' My boyfriend and I haven't been here for about a year, so we figured we were due for a cheeseburger deep dish pizza (our fave) and a pitcher of beer. It seemed like a good idea while watching a game of baseball, but... The cheeseburger deep dish pizza we loved... what happened to you? It's no longer served in the buttered deep dish we knew to recognize; it now just arrives on an extremely hot plate. The dough isn't buttery at all like before and the toppings were very skimpy. It seemed more like a regular pizza but with bloated dough--a more half-assed version of its former self. The kicker is that it isn't the worst part about the pizza. The worst part was my boyfriend biting into a small piece of plate in his slice. Yep. Apparently a piece of broken plate had gotten into the pizza somehow. It was small--about the size of a dime, but still very alarming. He could have damaged a tooth! I regret not taking a picture of it before letting the waitress take it to show the manager. Apparently it was hidden under the cheese and other ingredients which is why my bf didn't notice it before it was too late. We pretty much lost our appetite after our unfortunate discovery... The staff, at least, was very understanding toward the situation. The waitress apologized, took our pizza away and set up a replacement (which we didn't even ask for, but oh well). The manager was apologetic and told us that she ordered the kitchen staff to do a clean sweep of the kitchen, which was assuring. My boyfriend received a form to fill out about what happened and her business card in case he needed to contact her.  In the end, we weren't charged for the pizza and its replacement (we ended up taking it to-go and carefully eating it at home). I thought the staff did a good job of taking care of the matter, but honestly we will not be coming back because our impression of this place is pretty much ruined.

Went here around 3:30 for late pre-bday lunch on 11/3/13, we got seated right away since  it's not even busy. It's a party of seven, two are toddlers, we ordered appetizer which took 35 minutes, we got our soup and salad first before that.  The entree took 50 minutes to get to our table! Plates was hot but the food, side dishes and sauces are less than warm already and some are even cold to touch. My veggies are dry too since it's probably been in the food warmer too long and got dehydrated! Steak ordered was medium well and came out dry and warm not hot. We called the manager to complain about how long the food took before we got it and that it's luke warm and not acceptable. They convinced us to redo our order and will try to get it to us fresh. The steak came out more rare than medium well the next time around, we've been at this restaurant for two hours now and i convinced my brother not to complain anymore since it's been horrible already and we just want to leave!  The manager did give us complementary gift card to use for next time which will not happen since the food was terrible and not worth coming back for!

401,S. D.,"Columbus, OH",28,42,,1.0,2013-11-13,"This place managed to ruin my simple birthday dinner. Our sever was great and compassionate, the manager on the other hand was a bit inexperienced and uncaring.  Our appetizers were okay, nothing to write home about, but okay. Our wine was excellent.  Our steaks where bland and unseasoned, one arrived well done instead of medium and one arrived cooked okay. Now I remember about 6 months ago the steaks being delicious and tender with a garlic butter sauce, which apparently is what made it tasty and tender. Have you ever have a tough steak that was cooked medium, I didn't either until tonight.  Our baked potatoes where not baked, they might have been at one point but they where nuked warm after being chilled, because nuking a baked potato the sits in the fridge makes it that solid non-fluffy consistently that I received tonight. Even boiled potatoes are fluffier than what they tried to serve me. So we complained to the manager, one meal was deducted, granted I ate more of mine but a 10% discount or having made my  glass of wine free, on that plate would have been nice, because you not only ruined dinner but a birthday dinner. He did not try to apologize for the cooks, to me that says obviously he knows they are nuking cold things and does not care about the quality of the food, which also says inexperienced to me.  Then they try to make me happy with a birthday dessert, I do not want dessert after an awful meal, no, that does not make amends.  I will not be returning, not because of the server but because the food was awful and the manager barely cared. You've lost my business forever.

Everything seemed fine, the service was surprisingly pretty good, the food came out fast, we weren't too pleased with the lettuce wraps (the sauce was really sweet), but we ate and left. Well a couple hours later I started to feel a bit groggy and my stomach was feeling a little uneasy. I figured it could have been from the beer, or maybe I just overate, so I ignored it. A few hours later I felt a sudden sharp pain in my lower abdomen, and began cramping severely, after which I experience acute, bloody, diarrhea. I ended up spending the rest of my night/morning vomiting, cramping, and craping blood. Needless to say, it was food poisoning, most likely from the chicken on my pizza not being cook throughly. I was sick, and in bed the following day, and am still cramping.  My bf was telling his coworkers about the incident and ironically 2 out of the 8 present said they had experienced the same thing after eating at this Bj's.

I had my 21st birthday here two years ago and the person who waited on us was one of the best waiters i've ever had. That's not an exaggeration. Probably THE best i've ever had. He even created a drink for me and said I can name it! The bartender working at the time even came over and treated me to a shot and told me some ""breathing techniques"" to do while drinking them. All very very nice people. I remember my 21st very fondly and was very happy I decided to go there to celebrate it. I went again for the first time in a while (was out of the country for a couple of years) a few nights ago with my mom who is *very* nitpicky about restaurants. I was a little nervous she wouldn't like it... The waitress we had was adorable. She sat down at our booth (which was huge for only three people) and took our orders which I thought was cute. It showed she was comfortable with us which, in turn, made ordering fun. My mom ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop with a side salad and coffee... I, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. When mom's salad came she took a bite and instantly loved it (This is only the salad, folks. The salad.). ""Oh, this salad is DELICIOUS. Niki, here, you gotta try this salad. It's so crunchy and the sauce is wonderful! I need to make sauce like this. Here, try it! Just taste the salad!""  Yay, the salad gets an A+ from my mom.  Also, the coffee was the best coffee she's ever had at a restaurant. It had to have been freshly brewed because I tried it as well and it was ... so ... GOOD.  Coffee gets an A+ The main course arrived and, surprise, my mom was gushing over each bite. ""Oh. MMMM. This is so good. Try this. Let me get a piece of that chicken. OH. Yummy."" Main course A+ And how could we forget the Pizookie? My ten year-old sisters absolute favorite dessert on this planet. It's literally a huge, fresh-baked cookie topped with ice cream. My mind was blown when I realized it's a combination of the word ""pizza"" and ""cookie"". I'm slow, ok?

530,Angie V.,"Antioch, CA",284,14,4.0,2.0,2014-01-17,"To celebrate a birthday I joined my brother, sister and significant others for dinner here. This was my first time here. Here are my thoughts: Parking: Shared lot with a shopping mall made for a bit of driving in circles before a spot became available.  Host[ess]: I entered the restaurant by myself, there were no guests ahead of me. Still, I waited several moments for the 3 host/hostesses to come to a stopping point in their conversation to even notice me. Only one (the male) seemed concerned that I'd not only been waiting, but listening to their irrelevant conversation. I then had to ask not once, but three times where the bathrooms were as the first and second times I received (from two different hosts) a very vague ""just over there"" with a hand gesture pointing somewhere to the back? bar? off to the left?  Server: If I were reviewing the server alone, I would give him 4 stars. He was friendly, made eye contact, got our orders right without writing anything down, was quick-witted, seem to genuinely care and overall was quite a delight. (Alexander, you deserve some recognition!)  Unfortunately though, none of our dishes arrived timely. I do not fault our server for this as we had a different server bring each course. In my opinion, the appetizers were really the only course that should have arrived untimely, as 3 of us put in our appetizer order later than the first 2. This theme carried on throughout our meal though. Entrees came one, then two and two (party of 5). The birthday girl's dessert came immediately after dinner plates were cleared and then the rest of us were asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. The birthday girl's dessert was done before anyone came back to ask if we'd like to order dessert. We did, and we waited an incredibly long time for that too. There is nothing I hate more than sitting, waiting for the arrival of the rest of the party's food. Those who got theirs, feel uncomfortable knowing their food is getting cold. Those who are waiting feel uncomfortable as they wait hungry, salivating over the food that has arrived. Inevitably, someone insists they go ahead and start. They do, and the hungry continues to wait awkwardly, only to receive their dish just 3 bites before the first served finishes.  Food: Pretty good! The pasta was over cooked on one appetizer and the paired ""garlic bread"" was more like very large croutons - way over cooked. The mushroom appetizer had mushrooms of all sizes, mostly unusually large. Great for stuffing, sure, however I couldn't help but wonder where they came from (GMO, anyone?). My dinner, the balsamic chicken w/ mashed potatoes was just okay. The chicken was over cooked, but just barely. The mashed potatoes had good flavor but were very, very dry and not creamy. The balsamic drizzle was quite tasty, Small bites of balsamic, crispy onion garnish, baby greens salad and chicken made for a well rounded bite. The dessert, the berry pecan cobbler, lacked berries in a way that left me wondering if they warmed up a Costco blueberry muffin and served it with ice cream. If I wanted a dense, cake-like cookie, I would have order the pizookie. I wanted a fruit cobbler though, and that was definitely not what I got.  Miscellany: No one smiled, except for our server at a joke that was made in his presence.  The lighting was so dim that I could barely read the menu. Even more disturbing when I realized I could barely see my food once it finally arrived. My brother thought I'd ordered dessert for dinner as the balsamic looked like hot fudge and the mashed potatoes looked like ice cream. I couldn't tell if I had a berry cobbler or a chocolate chip pizookie.  So, would I go here again? No, especially not with any of my friends and certainly not with my chef husband! I'd be so embarrassed! Do I consider this place kid friendly? No. The menu did not reflect children being taken into consideration. If I were on a playdate of sorts, with kids, at the mall and we needed to get lunch, I would pick BJ's over the other mall options though. Their lunch specials look appealing enough and certainly won't break the budget. As a pregnant woman, the booth was bullshit - I barely had enough room to carefully slide my swollen belly under the table. BUT I did come in late, not with the group, so how could anyone seating our group know?  Who might like this place? Teenagers, young adults and anyone else who might not have experienced quality food or service, or those who are satisfied with mediocre.

At the end of the meal, the bill was brought and it was one bill and we were told we would have to separate it out as the waiter couldn't recall who ordered what. Even after we separated and organized the orders for him, he STILL messed up the separate checks. This took another half hour to sort out. We were at the restaurant for over an hour trying to  FIX the mess the waiter had made. The Manager was NEVER called. The waiter tried to ""make it all up to us"" by compting 25 % of the meals.

While waiting to be seated at the patio, there was a nice server handing everyone drinks and small slices of pizza. I thought that that was very kind of them. So, we waited for about 10 minutes because there was some disorganization, but we were finally seated. Yes, its outside, but there were heaters. At some point they turned it off and my feet were freezing.  Our server Melissa was very sweet, kind, and friendly. She really made up for the chaos that was going about in the patio. There was a giant group of about 20 (with lots of kids), a group of disgruntled older folks, and a whole lot of waiters and waitresses scurrying around.

Time is valuable, and this establishment really wasted my sister's and my time. If the food wasn't good, I'd probably never go back.  Unfortunately the food here is good enough to come back for. Now for the story. It's Friday, March 28, 2014. I just got home from work and my parents went to Cache Creek for the night so I brought my sister to BJ's (we were contemplating on where to eat for over 30 minutes until finally she decided BJ's). Before arriving my sister called to reserve a table for 2. So once we got there we checked in and they said we were next on the list. We waited for 5 minutes or so and were finally seated. After looking at the menu, we decided to order from their new ""Enlighted Entrees"" section (well new since the last time I was there). So then at ~9:00pm we ordered: Drinks: root beer and water Appetizer: Calamari 2 dinner plates:  Mahi-Mahi Tacos (chargrilled mahi-mahi with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce, fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips.) Lemon Thyme Chicken (Herb-roasted chicken breast served over brown rice, topped with sautéed red onions, tomatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.) After 5 minutes the calamari comes out pretty fast, so we eat that while waiting for our main courses. And the waiting commences. My sister and I talk about college, since my sister's a junior in high school right now and I just recently graduated from college, we talked about SATs and grades and which colleges she should apply. We already finished the calamari, and the time is now 9:45pm. My sister and I are wondering what's taking our food so long. So when the waitress walks by, my sister asks, ""Do you think you can check on our food?"" in which she replies, ""Yeah..it shouldn't be taking this long, let me go check."" 9:51pm, our waitress does a squat so that we're all on eye level, and tells us, ""I'm really sorry about this, but they lost your ticket in the back. They don't know what's going on back there. I'm really sorry about this. I told them to cook them as fast as they can."" My sister and I are just like :| at this point. It's almost 10:00pm already, it's kind of late for dinner, and we're not as hungry anymore because we had calamari.. Then our waitress offers us free salad, in which my sister and I happily accept. So we received 2 'Fresh Mozzarella and tomato Salads"" that were pretty good. Then just 15 minutes later, both of our orders came in. My sister and I ate half of each, and they were both really good. Under 800 calories per plate, yet packed full of flavor. The food being good is why this experience doesn't get 1 star (as well as the 4 refills of root beer I had which made me pretty full). Our waitress apologized again as she gave us our bill, and my sister and I said np. We know it's not her fault for the mistake they made in the back. I just wish she could have been more attentive of it though instead of us having to ask her to check on our food. Probably coming back here again eventually...but I just hope that we have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=360,2.88,2.62,2.72,2.152,2.724

Delivery driver was really sweet, but that's where any positive feedback ENDS!  We ordered southwest eggrolls, a santa fe chicken salad and a pizza. The eggrolls were edible but both the salad and pizza were absolutely not. They were the SALTIEST food items I have ever attempted to eat. The chicken in the salad (a seemingly somewhat healthy option) tasted like it had been soaking in ocean water then cooked in a salt bath and then dredged in salt. It was absolutely terrible. The pizza, aside from being horribly salty, was also undercooked and just gross. All this, horrible food, set us back $53 including a $7 delivery charge.  After eating a few bites of this disaster of a delivery dinner, I reached out to Grub Hub for help (their online chat tool is really handy, fyi) -- They submitted the complaint with the intermediary between Grub Hub and BJs, and on Monday my request for a refund was denied. Update: A couple of people from BJs coprorate have reached out to me to try to resolve this issue and I appreciate their follow up. 4 stars for corporate customer service...food was still awful though, but I do appreciate the effort!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=400,2.76,2.61,2.712,2.12,2.67

599,Rose P.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,16,,2.0,2014-05-04,"Let me qualify this review by stating that I have worked as a hostess and a server before, and so I know how difficult and chaotic the job can be. That said, this place really needs to tighten its gears when it comes to service. Most disorganized place I have been to in quite a while.  A friend was visiting from Sac and we went here just this afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner. Neither of us know much about the restaurants in this area, but we've been to various BJ's before and find them to be fairly dependable  as far as food is concerned. We also know, from previous experience, that service can be pretty spotty depending the location and how busy it is, but this one took the cake.  When we walked in the door, the manager and a host were standing at the host stand and the manager had to tell the host to stop talking to another employee and take care of us first. He left, and rather than seating us in the dining area or letting us know that there was a short wait for tables (it wasn't packed, but they only seemed to be seating in one area of the dining room), she asks us instead to check out the bar area because it was open seating. This wasn't a giant deal (just a little jarring) so we checked out the bar area but found no booths available. We went back to the stand, and they were in the process of seating a group of 3 people in the dining area, so apparently there were free tables available. There were also plenty of tables open in the patio area, so I'm not really sure why the first thing they recommended was for us to seat ourselves at the bar.  In the end, because it was a nice day, we chose to sit outside. They have a pretty large patio area, and at the time, there were only three small tables occupied (two couples and a group of 3 girls), but we still had to wait for them to wipe a table down before we could sit. While they're wiping the table down, the host seating us said, ""oh, let me get some silverware""--this will come into play later--and goes to fetch them. We're seated, and a couple of minutes later, our server comes to take our drink orders (two coffees, a water, a diet). She brings the drinks to us but has to make a second trip for sugar and cream for the coffee. We order our entrees.  I can't say how long it took the food to make an appearance as we weren't in any particular hurry, but it did seem longer than our usual experience. My friend had a cheeseburger and fries. I ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side. When they put the plate down in front of me, I didn't know what to think. It was probably the blandest presentation of fried chicken ever (and I love fried chicken). The two breast pieces were much smaller than I anticipated, more brown than gold, and were just lying on top of a mound of mashed potatoes--this was everything on the plate.  Luckily, they tasted better than they looked, but you eat first with your eyes, and it was not a sight that whet my appetite, to say the least. Furthermore, that silverware I mentioned earlier? They apparently never made it on to the table, so we had to flag another server down in order to get a fork for my mashed potatoes. We hadn't seen our server for a while, at this point, though she did reappear shortly after the other one went inside.  There were just a lot of little things like this that overall gave the impression that no one in this place has it together. In addition to the above, about ten minutes after we were seated and while we were waiting for our drinks to appear, another server came to our table to ask if we'd already been helped. On the one hand, it's nice that she thought to make sure, but on the other, shouldn't every server know which table belongs to who, rather than everyone having to follow up with all the customers to make sure no one is being ignored/forgotten about? Also, in the time that we were there, three different times, food runners came out asking each table if they happened to order the dish they were carrying--they had no idea what food was supposed to go to what table. (Keep in mind that there were only five tables there after another couple sat down, and three of them were already in the middle of their meal or finished.) To her credit, our server was friendly as was everyone else. It was just the general feeling of disorganization and chaos that really marred the experience. Hopefully they can fix these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=500,2.68,2.68,2.696,2.216,2.68

Love when that happens, but it was all downhill from there. The runner brought our appetizer without plates. He ran off before we could ask him for some. Our calamari was mostly the tentacles - you know, the spinely part of the squid. Then our entrees came out. The pork chop was really dry and hard to cut. Thank goodness I asked for the sauce on the side because it was cold and sickeningly hot/spicy. I would not have been able to eat the pork chop if it was served with the sauce on it. It came with green beans and red potatoes which were very dry/over cooked. My son thought he ordered a large baked potato, but we found out when they brought out his tiny, overcooked potato that they don't make those anymore. He also ordered a side of broccoli which was in a tiny dish where the broccoli was covered with dried out carrots. There were a total of four tiny pieces of broccoli in the dish. The pizza was disappointing - I would say a tad bit better than microwave pizza. This was their normal crust - the deep dish pizza that some of the other diners had looked more promising.

The HUGE, four-image TV was impressive, bit without sound, who cares?  Bar was packed, but we found two seats at the far end.  Bartender was busy, so much so that what should have been a 45-minute meal stretched into double that.  She was perky, friendly but all business.  I asked about special drinks and she convinced me to try a pear cider. Good, sweet and not too tart. Ordered two appetizers, as I prefer grazing and was not super hungry.  Chose the Crispy (read: Fried) Calamari, with two dipping sauces, and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms I saw on the plate of the diner next to me, who raved about them.  My friend had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon.  Then the wait began.  The place was not super crowded, and yet it took almost 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  My friend's tomato soup was brought to him, but neither of my dishes were forthcoming until his salmon showed up. Finally, a runner brought the plates and by then, I was ready to dig in.  The calamari, a long-time favorite, was properly and lightly coated with a crispy, non-greasy batter and fried just barely past the well-done but still chewy stage.  The alleged Lemon Garlic Aioli was more Ranch-like, but still better than the flavorless ""Spicy"" Marinara, which, at the very least, needed salt.  These were not the large, sometimes-rubbery rings offered everywhere, but smaller circles along with nicely crunchy larger pieces as well. The mushrooms were another story altogether, and not a good one.  The first bite of the half 'shroom I bit into had good fungus flavor, and that was about it.  None of the promised flavors of a ""blend of fresh spinach, BJ's own spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese"".  That is a whopping seven (7) items, all stuffed into one little cap.  But that ain't the end.  The almost final product is then, ""drizzled with lemon pesto sauce.""  Perhaps.  But the only real, pronounced flavor discernible was a vinegar-y tartness, tinged barely with citrus.  None of the Feta's saltiness, no earthy Spinach or Artichoke notes, not even, again, salt.

Lol ordered a shrimp ceasar salad & the shrimp tasted half cooked made my stomach hurt. My boyfriends steak was not well done really undercooked. The time we sat there was ridiculous we were seated waiting on or order to be taken for over an hour. Crazy right? But on top of that it wasn't even packed & ppl that we were there 20 minutes seated before had already been served with drinks & their meals came about 45 minutes before ours. Why we didn't leave?

Worse thing is that our original waiter took his break and never told any other waiter anything. We got up and left. Last week we decided to give it another shot. BAD IDEA. Again for no reason whatsoever after an hour of ordering, no food to be seen. Asked to remove the pizza from the bill since we were there with family.

74,Rachel Ann C.,"Irvine, CA",416,303,1459.0,3.0,2014-08-15,"I've been here several times over the years and my experience has always been inconsistent. It's mostly about the customer service. Employees will forget about my table sometimes, neglect to come back or take my order, forget to get my beer. Other times, they are extremely friendly and courteous and are willing to serve you. I've had a waitress one time who seemed like she was flirting with a customer in the bar. Same goes for another guy serving a table of girls. Service aside, the food is standard BJ's. Their appetizers and entrees tend to run HUGE. Just look at the calorie count--it's definitely something NOT for one person. I tend to split the bigger entrees and pastas with another person as it's enough for two. The appetizers are DEFINITELY shareable between 3+ people. If you're looking for a more personalized one-person or small group appetizer, go for the Snacks and Small Shares portion of the menu. You'll definitely save your appetite and money. Most of their foods are huge, greasy and packed with flavor which makes you fill up. Not entirely healthy but... It is BJ's. Since it is a brewhouse, they have such a great selection of beers. For a light beer-cider blend, I love their Black Velvet beer. It's a nice brew of their BJ's Porter (coffee-chocolate-malt roast) and Cider blend. It's sweet but balanced well with their dark brew. I've heard of their other beers as well and people tend to generally enjoy them--just find what suits you! Overall, mediocre experiences altogether. Pizookies are usually a guilty pleasure and you can never go wrong if you're ready to indulge in those. A restaurant and brewhouse that packs on the flavors and sizes in their foods, good happy hour with a great beer selection, and mediocre service.

And it's weird to say that because I'm honestly very understanding and patient when it comes to going out to eat, and I understand how difficult it is to be a waitress so I don't mind patiently waiting to order.  The first horrible service I received is when my boyfriend and I decided to eat here. We were seated promptly but then everything after was just bad. Not only were everyone else getting served around us it took us probably 15 min to get served water and so we ordered right away. Our waiter is no where to be found, and I keep reassuring my boyfriend that they are probably busy and try to get our minds off the wait. But after hunting down our waiter about our food, he tells us it should be out in a bit. AND 35-40 min later NOTHING. No water refill or anything, we give them another 5 min. And still nothing, so we finally walked out.  I decided to go again w my family after we had a baseball game to give them the benefit of the doubt. And while our waiter was a young guy who communicated very well w my family. I just don't understand how LITERALLY every member of my family gets their food and of course my small deep dish pizza is no where to be found. My family ordered 2 other pizzas which already arrived, and the guy didn't even check to make sure we had all out food. We had to tell him about our food and he said he'll check on it. Then another 15 min later nothing so I tell him to cancel it. I am soooo pissed about this place I can't even explain.

713,Krystal A.,"Martinez, CA",1,13,7.0,1.0,2014-08-23,"Me and 5 of my friends went to the BJ's in concord last night and we literally had the WORST service EVER! If I could give 0 stars, I would. First off, we called about 40 minutes prior to us arriving for their call ahead seating for up to 6 people in your party. When we arrived at 8pm we told the host that we did the call ahead seating and stated the name is was under, they could not find my friends name that she put it under. Then they continued to explain to us that our wait time starts when we arrive, I asked what's the point of call ahead seating then and she said that she thinks calls ahead seating should only be for parties of 5 and under. So then, we waited our 30 minutes to be seated and then waiting about another 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. When our server greeted us he took our drink order right away, but then didn't see him for about 20 minutes. When he arrived with our drinks he then stated that he forgot to ring in one of my friends drinks from the bar, well we all already knew how long their drinks from the bar take so needless to say my friend was bummed that he was going to have to wait another 20 minutes to get his drink. After we got our 1st round of drinks he never asked us if we were ready to order or anything, he just dropped our drinks and left, he came back about 15 minutes later and took our order for our dinner (this is around 930pm, we've been at our table for an hour before he took our dinner order). At the time he took our dinner order we all ordered another round of drinks. It took probably 30 minutes for us to get our dinner and when it arrived, my friend ordered a large pizza and my boyfriend ordered a small pizza, the guy who brought our pizzas didn't say watch your hands, hot plates, no he just slid the hot pizza pans across he table and almost burnt my boyfriends hand if he didn't move it on time. Then it took about another 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and this time he OVER ordered drinks, some of us didn't want another round and I even had a non alcoholic drink and I never got another one. Lets just say our server was VERY overwhelmed and desperately needed help with his tables. When it came time for our bill to come he just dropped it and walked away, I numbered everything 1,2, 3 (there was 3 couples) and told him to just split everything with the numbers on the side of what was ordered, he then said ""I will try, but its going to take while to do this for you"" ... If I already numbered everything for you it shouldn't take that long. 15 minutes later he comes and just gives everyone a receipt with no booklet and he STILL got things wrong and put other peoples items on eachothers checks!

I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger, well-done, along with the crispy fries.  I have to say, this burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my whole life.  I ordered it well-done, and if you like well-done burgers, then you know that it has a special flavor to it when it's cooked correctly.  Well they absolutely nailed it.  The bacon was top-notch and the bun complimented the burger very well.  I've had burgers from places like paddock café where I also felt they were VERY good, but this was truly a gourmet burger, on another level both in terms of quality, as well as price ;)  The crispy fries were also extremely good, making it pretty much a prefect dinner.  They have a great selection of beer to choose from also, and I enjoyed being able to try a new beer. Only real downer is that the waiter was not very attentive to us.  It seemed like the only time we could get his attention was by basically flagging him down.  Everyone felt pressured to order a new drink during the few rare times the waiter came by, whether they were finished with their current drink or not, simply because you couldn't count on the waiter actually coming around to give you another chance anytime soon.  The table we were sitting in was sort of in the middle of everything, which is the only reason we were able to flag down the waiter on occasion.  If we had been on the edge or something, we would have been screwed, maybe seeing the waiter once every half hour or less.  Even though this place is not particularly cheap, their service certainly is!  For me though, the food is the most important aspect, and I really enjoyed my meal this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=380,2.68,2.66,2.68,2.192,2.668

Service was Excellent 4.  Presentation of food and fries was good.  5. Bison burger center was raw returned it and the 2nd one was mostly cooked but a small portion was still raw. 10/27/14 Complained to management and they stated they would review problem with cooks managers.  Considering the problems we have in this country with under cooked food I was surprised that this could happen twice in a row. I think this is either a cook not using proper cooking time or possible cold spot on the grill in either case I hope they take care of the problem.

Their avocado roll appetizers are super tasty, and personally, I thought my order of cajun chicken pasta was pretty tasty. My grandma though, ordered a cheeseburger and it was really really sad looking. It was also missing the cheese and the spread that they asked her if she wanted to put on. Oops.  But the real kicker was that they had ads for this really sweet looking pumpkin fireball drink on the table, but the waitress didn't tell us they didn't actually have pumpkin beer (even though it was a Thursday) until we tried to actually order it. It was like omg what, why couldn't you tell us this sooner. Thank goodness they have other tasty beers, but it was still kind of disappointing. Service overall was just kind of really blah; not bad enough to make me never want to come again, but definitely not good.

My sister ordered the Double Deluxe Burger without tomatoes, pickles and any condiments (i.e. no sauce). I ordered the Brewhouse burger w/ bacon, no pickles. When our burgers came, both were seemingly dry of any condiments. I understand that confusion since my sisters request was kind of odd when you read the description of the burger and there probably was just a mix up with our table. No big deal to me. I just asked our waitress for some mayo (which my burger originally was supposed to come with) and added it myself with some ketchup. This burger was still so bland!! Just no flavor at all except for the few bites I could taste the bacon. And the bun was soooo dry! I ended up picking off parts of it to get around the dryness. It was actually a chore to try and finish this thing. My sister said her burger was good but half of the bun had a weird mustardy type of sauce on it. I got the wedge cut fries, her the crispy thin and both were very tasty. Next time I think I would try one of their signature pizza's.

There were 3 mistakes made to our orders. Usually I give the server the benefit of the doubt, but since the expos (food runners) had the order slips in hand I could see that it was a mistake in the order taking. I will go into further detail of our orders and mistakes later. The server was very sweet at first. Until  we asked him to split the check (which I had asked him to do when we were greeted), he looked at us seemingly annoyed and walked away. This was the point when we had decided not to tip.

282,Miss C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,58,,1.0,2015-01-17,"Have been to other BJ's locations with great experiences. Went to this one tonight, the margarita was WEAK and overly sweet, the potato skins were chalky & gross, they literally disintegrated into a pile if powder when you cut into them. Waiter left us for long periods of time. Asked other waitstaff for help, they said they were ""looking for him too"". Nice. Screwed up both of our orders...(2 cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad), and they both came out wrong (and brought out by a different waiter). Pretty simple...asked for one plain, and one with onion strings.  The plain one showed up with all toppings, and they put the onions for the other one on top of the caesar salad instead of the burger (WTF?!) Had to send back.  Then we had some other guy come over, I assume the manager but he didn't introduce himself, asking us what was wrong with the order. We told him, he was apologetic, but then just walked away without comment. Then we were left again another 15 minutes. Empty drinks & dirty appetizer plates just sat on the table. Flagged down yet another waitress, asked to order 2 more drinks, she said she'd order for us.  Original waiter came by, with attitude asked what was wrong with our order, then just walked away.  Another 15 minutes, no drinks. Yet ANOTHER waitress finally brought our corrected food. We asked to cancel the drink order & get boxes to take out food home. Funny, she said the 2nd drink order was NEVER PLACED.  Then original waiter returned & left the check. I noticed they refunded the price of one meal they messed up, but nobody told us they were doing that.  No tip. And we'll never go back. They have a HUGE staff working, and they are completely disorganized & few of them care about service.

I only come to BJ's whenever my friends have a last minute plan to come together to get some drinks and eats. Although their entrees are average and seemingly generic to me, I think their forté is their appetizer selection. I really like their artichoke and spinach dip, and their fried calamari is really crispy and good. They have a good selection of drinks, but that's to be expected from a restaurant that specializes in homemade brews. My current favorite is the Gulden Draak Ale. As for the quality of service, expect some delays. Not sure what the reason is, but I always end up waiting a long time for my food. During the later hours, you go in and seat yourself, and it costs an arm or a leg to get the attention of a server.

Within 10 min out appetizer and beverages came out. In my head I was thinking we are going to get our food pretty quick. We finished our drinks and appetizer by 845 and enjoyed the game that was on tv. Around 915 I noticed our food wasn't out yet. Keep in mind it was not busy. At 930 our waiter (Amy) came to our table to explain to us the mishap that happened in the kitchen. She informed us that our food is on priority and will be out ASAP. In addition she informed us that the manager was going to come around to speak to us. Now I get it, nothing is every perfect and things happen. Our food came out 20min later and our waiter asked if the manager came around yet to ""speak to us"". I was not expecting a lot. I wasn't even expecting free food. The manager Daniel came around and asked us ""if there anything else you need or anything I can get for you"" we replied with ""no its ok"" and he went on and said ""if there is anything else you need just let the waiter know"". Now I've worked in retail for a long time and things happen but for the manager to show ZERO EMPATHY was beyond my imagination. A simple acknowledgment that our food came out later and a simply apology for that would have made it a semi better experience. You are the manager duty of a large establishment and I would have expected more.

He tries his best to up his game and exude quality in his work. However, his attempts usually fall short, disingenuous, and tries to salvage the attempt by putting a humorous spin on his shortcomings. I'm rather confused as to what kind of restaurant this is. Is it a place for dinner? No, its too casual. Is it a place for lunch? Sure, if two hour lunches are part of your company policy. Just like the unfortunate millennial generation, it's surviving on handouts from their middle class parents.  If you've been to on BJ, you've been to them all. Almost everything down to the servers are the same at every BJ. I'm not convinced that they're an equal opportunity employer.  Ok, down to business. I use to think the food is less than acceptable. However today, I thought the food was good. I ordered a rib eye steak, medium rare with soup and mash potatoes. I enjoyed the meal. It's worth another visit if I get another coupon. I recommend ordering your meal ahead of time if you don't want to wait a long time for your food.  +1 star: Order was correct, and the food was tasty.  +1 star: Service was fine.

It's just a large chocolate chip cookie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. People treat this as the best invention since sliced bread. I've had ample opportunity to try it in the past and on all occasions I've been puzzled by the attraction people have to this strange desert. It's almost pure profit for the restaurant.

165,Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286.0,3.0,2015-04-01,"My boyfriend and I came here after a long night of bingo playing. It was one of the only places that was still open at 11:30PM. I hadn't ever been to this particular BJ's, I knew it was by the mall...but I didn't know if it was on the other side of the freeway with all the other restaurants. Note: it's connected to the mall.  Since it was so late, the dining room was closed and only serving in the bar area. That was fine, there was a good amount of people sitting in there. Service was a little on the slow side at first, but once our waitress came, it picked up.  My boyfriend and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, wings and a flatbread pizza. The spinach and artichoke dip, we could have passed on. It was like it had been sitting out from earlier and they threw it in the microwave and reheated it. It was a weird quiche-like texture, instead of a creamy dip, like texture. I suppose that's what happens when you go to a restaurant late. The wings, we ordered half and half, different sauces. I got the garlic parmesean and my boyfriend got some hot buffalo flavored sauce. I liked mine, they were good with ranch. You do have to ask for an extra side of ranch though, if you have two different flavors because they only give you one.  The flatbread pizza was okay. A little more greasy than I remembered from other locations, but overall we liked it. Our waitress was really nice. It was my birthday, so she made sure to bring out a personal sized pizookie.  I understand that going to businesses close to when they're closing can change your experience a little bit. I wouldn't say that this isn't a bad location, but you could definitely tell that they wanted to get out of there ASAP that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=180,2.76,2.69,2.668,2.508,2.718

Please update the menu online. So I ended up ordering two DEEP dish pizzas that was $50. I went to go pick up the pizzas that looked like regular pizzas that could pass for Pizza Hut. I even asked the take out staff about the pizza, and they agreed that this is what their DEEP dish pizza is. PLEASE! The only difference is the crust looked like it had been puffed with air.

Every once in a while I'll crave a pizookie and come by with my family.  BUT THEN we'll come in and the service is so bad that it'll remind us why we don't come in so often.  We prob haven't been to this location in over a year prior to today's visit. The service was just as bad back then.  Today our server was Katie. We've seen her here over a year ago so she's been around for a while. We used to see her in the bar area but I guess she's serving on the lower dining area now. We arrived at approx. 7:45pm and didn't leave until approx 9:10pm. We were seating for at least ten minutes before they took our order or even brought waters over. We ordered an appetizer (carnitas fries, they prob weren't worth the $6), a pizza to share, my son ordered a kids meal, and we shared a pizookie at the end.  When ordering, I asked Katie to tell me what was on one of the pizzas featured on the table that wasn't in the menu (I think it was called the Prime Veggie?), and she had no idea but pulled an answer out of her ass. She proceeded to ask me ""What DON'T you like, and I'll tell you if it's on there?"" I didn't have an answer for her but I told her I just wanted it to have artichokes. She confidently said that it did so I ordered it, but of course we later found out that it did NOT have artichokes. She didn't come by the table very much, and when she did we asked her for two ranch dressings. She only brought one. When we reminded her about the second one, she never brought it.  We didn't order much but it took SO LONG for us to be served. I understand that sometimes it may be a little busy, but the service was bad as soon as we sat down. Another thing that irritated me was that for some reason the table next to us that arrived after we did (and had a bigger party than us) received their check before we did! UGH. I had to calm my boyfriend down because he was ready to just get up, leave, and tell the people in the front that Katie was taking too long to come by with our check.  Bj's is nice, but not this location. The service here is horrible, and has been for years. Only come if you're not in a rush or have nothing to do for the rest of your night. And Katie-- I've worked in the restaurant industry before, where I've had to know what came with every single menu item and combination we offered. We know you're not new here, so I suggest you step your customer service game up. I apologize if this is harsh, but I believe that you did NOT deserve the 15% that I tipped you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=160,2.56,2.65,2.672,2.408,2.614

So I come here with my mom and my brother after a long day of shopping and getting new phones (which was stressful enough!!!!) to sit down and enjoy a meal cause yknow what's better than spending quality time with your family??? Hmmm well first of all we enter the restaurant and tell the person in the front our name so they could call it when the table was ready. Ten to fricking fifteen minutes pass and all we see is ppl who came in after us getting seated so we were like ummmm are you serious?? Is this a racial thing?? Probably. So the same front person that took are name asks ""are you guys ready to check in?"" Me being a hardcore yelper took it the wrong way so I didn't really understand what that meant but my mom was like UM ya we already checked us in. IT WAS THE SAME GIRL THAT CHECKED US IN BUT SHE SOMEHOW ""FORGOT"" ABOUT US. I am putting quotes bc this is probably has something to do with race. The fact that that was how our lunch started showed a lot. Okay so after we order our food and all that stuff we get our calamari, salad, and flatbread while I got my Cali chicken sandwich. What disappointed me the most was the calamari bc I know what good calamari is and that was NOT good calamari. It was cold and not crunchy at all which really disappointed me bc I love calamari so much. Another thing was their water!! It tasted weird and had a slightly odd after taste to it but maybe it was just the drought effecting our water but who knows! Anyway we were so disappointed we didn't even want dessert.

Unfortunately when our food came...much later..our experience took another nosedive. His sliders were tiny and dry. My carnitas fries were almost inedible. The carnitas meat was fried and then must have been baked to the point where the meat was just a rock on top of the fries.

338,Naomi S.,"Pittsburg, CA",6,37,19.0,3.0,2015-06-08,"Like everyone in the area, I've been to BJs numerous times because I like their food and ambiance. Because of this, I decided to throw my fiancé a surprise birthday on Sunday, June 7 since their outdoor patio would accommodate our 40+ headcount. Let's get to it: Positives: -Manager Michael Gatto took the time to speak with me over the phone and go over my selected family-style menu for the day. He even offered to provide our 7 kids complimentary cheese pizzas! So nice! -Tables were set up and ready for our guests before our 1:30PM reservation time so no one had to wait to be seated! -Michael Gatto came out to the patio to introduce himself to me since we had spoke and emailed over the phone. He asked how everything was going and wanted to greet my fiancé. I thought that was great customer service and I appreciated that he wanted to meet his guests! -Our servers Ceci and Dijonae carried themselves well. They didn't look stressed out handling such a large party and they always had a friendly smile on their face. I enjoyed talking to them very much! Negatives -The planning phase was terrible due to lack of communication. I emailed BJs on two separate occasions regarding their menu but did not receive a response. I also called BJs on two other occasions and left my name and number but received no call back. It wasn't until my third email that Michael Gatto got back to me (I should note that Michael was not the initial manager who helped me. Alyssa Alvarado was the dining manager who helped me book my reservation and sent me an email with the menu. I never heard back from Alyssa after I tried to contact via email and phone). -The entrees I ordered were suppose to be prepared on four different plates so that they could be placed on four separate tables to be shared family style. Instead, the entrees were prepared on one or two plates which required my guests to stand up and pass the plate to another table. Very inconvenient on a hot June day outside where space was limited. After the first few times this happened it was later corrected for subsequent entrees. -Since I had sent Michael Gatto the exact entree and quantity of each dish I wanted via email, and since he confirmed everything, I didn't expect there to be any hiccups with my receipt so I signed and left. I was wrong. When I got home I reviewed the receipt and noticed that I was actually charged for the cheese pizzas that were suppose to be complimentary. I also noticed that the quantities of each dish I ordered were incorrect (they were less). It was such a busy day that I'm not even sure if my guests just didn't receive all the food I had ordered, or if I received a discount. I doubt it's the latter because I saw nothing complimentary on my receipt.  Although Michael Gatto was helpful, and our servers Ceci and Dijionae were great, my overall experience with planning a large party at BJs is three stars. There were just too many problems during the planning phase and the day-of the celebration for me to overlook. I still think BJs is a good restaurant and I would return, but I would never plan a large celebration here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=320,2.68,2.69,2.64,2.412,2.686

I'm not much of a drinker period so I asked our server which one she recommended. She steered me towards the Tickle Me Pink which I ended up ordering, but once I tried it, I really did not like it. MacKenzie was a doll and offered to take it off the menu in exchange for a different drink. I took her offer and ordered BJ's berry burst cider, which tasted so much better. I'd definitely recommend it. It's light and sweet but decent enough for someone like me with a really low tolerance to drink.  In terms of food, our group ordered the chicken wings in spicy and Parmesan, avocado egg rolls, fries, and the flatbread to share. I have nothing bad to say about the appetizers except that the avocado egg rolls are executed better at CPK and the Cheesecake Factory.  For my entree, I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The salad looked really pretty and tasted good. I ate the whole thing, but then again, I really love salads. My boyfriend ordered the mahi mahi. The couscous was cooked well, but the fish was tough and overcooked. At first, the tomato sauce paired well with the fish and couscous but the more you ate it, the acidity from the tomatoes became too much and it started to taste like the acidic bile from when you throw up. Pretty gross. Also, my friends ordered the shrimp scampi and the bison burger. According to them, the shrimp scampi was too dry with very little sauce and the bison burger was overcooked. The only thing that tasted good was the pizza.  Lastly, the pazookie is always good. We ordered the pazookie trio with chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia, and cookies n cream. All were yummy. No complaints there.  Overall, the appetizers were better than the entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=100,2.8,2.69,2.648,2.316,2.734

By this time I am starving because I had not eaten in hours due to meetings and a gradation. I order the BJ's Classic Rib Eye Steak and asked it to be cooked to medium rare. When I finally received my food I was extremely disappointed. The rib eye was a horrible cut of meat,  more than 30% of the steak was gristle and fat. It was nearly impossible to cut a piece that didn't have fat on it. I did not send it back because I did not wish to wait 40 minutes for another steak. I ate 1/2 at the restaurant and took the rest home as it was too much of a hassle to finish there. I did order a peanut cookie pizookie and it was delicious.

We ordered a pitcher of beer and waters right off the bat. 15 minutes had gone by and we hadn't even seen our waiter. When we finally found him, he said the bartender had ""cut her hand or something"", and that's why it was taking so long. Another 10 minutes goes by. We finally get our pitcher after almost 30 min, ordered food, and waters (again).  Food came quick and was good. We asked for napkins and forks, twice. Which never came. Our waiter (Salvador) seemed to busy flirting with some waitress at the bar then tending to his tables. The one directly behind was also complaining about their service. We finally flagged down a different waiter to talk to the manager. Before the manager came out waiter finally came out from wherever he was hiding and we asked again for silver wear and waters. By now our food was getting cold (calamari and Brussel sprouts...two things not good when cold) so we used our fingers. Boy that was pretty gross as the food was super greasy. Beer had been gone for awhile. The manager came out and listened to what we had to say and said he would take some stuff off our bill, but NEVER even apologized. Our waiter was MIA for another 20 min, and when he returned he didn't even ask if we wanted refills. We AGAIN asked for water and napkins. Finally got napkins, NO WATER. The manager took half off our food. We had to of course find the waiter and ask for our check. Another 15 min go by, and we have to find the waiter to even take out payment.

On Monday night it was my friends 21st birthday, and he absolutely loves BJs and would eat there everyday if he could. Anyways, as we seated ourselves at the bar, 5 of us, we were asked what to drink, or should I say some of us were asked what we want to drink. Okay, whatever, no biggie. Then it took foreverrrrrr to find our waiter. Okay, finally she came, took our order and went on with her life again. Mind you, it is about 10pm and it was very slow. Then she comes later and asked if we need utensils.... what do you mean do we need utensils?!? I guess we're supposed to eat our soup and salad with our hands... Before out food came she brought us the dirties/wettest plates ever and only brought four. Seriously you would think she is blind by the fact that she didn't see the food crumbs and how greasy the plate were. Then, out comes the food, from a nice woman by the name of Marsha(i think) and she asks us if we need anything and made sure everything's ok, now the birthday boy says, ""why can't she be our waiter?"" As we were about to eat our food we realize... we DO NOT have utensils... They also forgot my soup and it was cold... Onto dinner, the food was absolutely great as always, then we realized our drinks have been empty for quite some time now. Eventually enough was enough, so my friend, having experience in serving customers decides to ask for a manager, and boy was he an unapologetic a**. He sarcastically said, ""is here anything else that I can get you that you didn't get?"" Not once an apology, I almost wanted to ask for his manager. I guess when the manager is more like your friend you get away with giving shitty service. Then TIFFANI(our waiter) walks by and ask another waiter, ""Do you need help?"" WTF, what do you mean do she need help? YOU NEED HELP. We need help.  Okay, so to conclude my essay, the waiter, who finally came out from hiding asks the birthday boy would he like a pizookie....................and he says no!!! wtf, what do you mean no?!?! He loves pizookies, but that literally how shitty our server was, she sucked the enthusiasm out of us, he couldn't even find her to order his first legal drink!

601,Matt H.,"Concord, CA",18,10,2.0,2.0,2015-10-22,"I usually don't go to BJ's during my lunch break since it takes too long to get food, but I discovered their mobile app recently which I thought would make things very convenient to order in advance. Two days in a row now I've had problems (yesterday my burger arrived with no cheese, despite the request being very visible on the receipt), today they clearly didn't start making my food until I arrived to pick it up. They had sent me a confirmation email with the pick up time clearly stipulated, yet I spent half of my lunch break waiting for it to be brought out. My biggest problem in both cases was the lack of accountability for error, in both instances an employee gave me an excuse that was clearly meant to distance the restaurant from the problem, rather than accept responsibility. Yesterday it was ""oh well the order just didn't print correctly"" (they showed me the slip and it printed just fine), today ""your food isn't ready but it's being bagged up"" (took nearly 20 minutes to ""bag"" my food, clearly a lie). To BJ's: take responsibility for your errors and stop treating your customers like they're idiots. You get two stars because the food, when it finally arrives, is quite tasty, otherwise you'd have 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=480,2.56,2.82,2.664,2.088,2.716

The meal cost pennies per serving, and it's a bad business decision for any self-respecting restaurant. I have no complaint with boxed mac 'n cheese when I'm lazy at home, but no one who cares about food serves boxed Macaroni and Cheese to paying customers. 2 - My hamburger cost $11.25, before tax. $11.25! It was meh: not bad, but definitely not good. For $11, I expect my bacon cheeseburger to be dripping in some crack-based delicious sauce, possibly BBQ, with thick applewood bacon slices, onions - grilled or rings, and sharp cheddar dripping over a half pound grass-fed Angus burger on a fancy bun. No!!! At BJ's an $11 burger is rather pathetic: a smallish patty on a plain bun - no sauce, paper thin bacon, a slice of raw red onion, and the cheese was placed as an afterthought in that weird not melted but lukewarm sweaty stage just sitting on the burger.  3 - Shoestring French fries were so unhealthy and fried so many times they would've been decadent if they had arrived hot or at least warm. 4 - The ""healthy"" grilled chicken was so salty my kid wouldn't eat it.  5 - For a ""brewery"" BJ's offers no local, unique, or interesting beers. 6 - Everything was soo expensive it made the mediocrity insulting.

The spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza was okay. It wasn't spicy, had jalapeños on it to make it spicy and the sauce on it...what sauce? I hardly tasted any sauce.

221,Concerned C.,"Martinez, CA",2,35,,2.0,2016-04-13,"SUMMARY: My best guess is poor management with no leadership. EXPLANATION: Where to begin.... When we first started going here, they seemed pretty good. Good location with lots of staff who did their jobs, decent food, and not much competition.  In the last couple years, we noticed the service and quality have dropped significantly. Sometimes there are lots of staff, but when there are, it seems they group together and talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are working there. Other times there are few staff, and they still talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are there. Of course, there have always been good, hard working employees also.  A while back, we were helped by a relatively new employee there (Jake). We got to talking to him, and he explained that he came here from another BJ's location to help the manager create a better environment for the customers and employees--they ARE related. It was a great conversation that made us feel better about coming back.  The last two times we have come here, we were somewhat enthusiastic about having Jake for a server. Each time, however, he just didn't seem to care anymore. Most recently, we heard him complaining about staff. We noticed that not a single other employee came behind the bar to assist him with anything. Apparently, in turn, Jake demonstrated his unhappiness, anger, or frustration by providing us with very short and rude service....oh and the food sucked. We left the customary tip, but I do not know why... As we were leaving, we stopped outside the door to get our stuff together. There. we overheard two employees (who were on a smoke break) complaining about working there.  It is sad to see a place, that should be great (based on location, menu, and apparent backing) devolve to this level where nobody wants to be there.

Sure I apologize for not leaving a good tip BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT.  I had enough money to just be able to pay for the pazookies which is why I chose to purchase it only. My money has been going to college. I'm not a rich girl who won't notice any extra charges to her account. This waitress probably decided to add a extra 6 dollars to my account and thought I wouldn't notice. My account was overdrawn because of her and if I did not catch it I would have been charged a extra 25 dollars from my bank because of this desperate girl who thought it was okay to do what she did. This is not OKAY at all. Beware coming here because you'll get screwed over. STOP going here and go to Lucille's BBQ instead since it is right by it.

60,Melissa T.,"Contra Costa, CA",42,101,222.0,3.0,2016-06-10,"So it's a Friday basically morning we arrive at 10:57 am and I was under the impression oh we have a few minutes til they open. Go inside with half of our party and realize the place is pretty empty so no biggie. We let the hostess know that we have a group of 13 coming from an 8th grade graduation. They let us know they're getting the table together. Gotcha.  So I run down to forever 21 real quick while the tables getting set and the rest of our group arrives. And I spent a good 15-20 mins in the store. So my niece and I rush back to our group thinking man they've probably already ordered..right? Soooo not the case. After I settle I ask what you guys order. And I get a look back at me that made me realize something is not right. Come to find out no waiter have been introduced neither has anyone asked for a drink order from us or even come by to check on us.  To fast forward after two personal face to face attempts and a phone call that was put on hold to figure out what's going on. Do we have a waiter ? Is there an issue? We get nothing in return. Not even a courteous do you need help from neighboring waiters.  It truly felt they were all ignoring us because we were staring each and every waiter down. So I go to the bar and actually ask a bartender for water for our table. And she thought I asked for a water for myself. And I reiterated that we all needed water for the table because after 30 mins we still haven't had a server approach us.  Once I sat, a waiter who apparently just so happen to be in that area where we were seated noticed how famished we were. Asked if we needed anything? And we told him actually can you wait on us as a joke. He said he actually was going to wait on us but was told not to someone else was going to. So he said forget it I'll do it. We all started clapping, thanks to Saul or Sal!! He was excellent and didn't get anything wrong. As he was taking our drink orders the lovely bartender I spoke with prior had waters for us. And asked have we been taken care of? By the time we got our drink orders in, groups that arrived after us already boxed up their food. Which made us very upset. Again never upset at Saul he was on point although the the orders took a minute but by this time the restaurant went from 5 groups of her than us to near full capacity.  I can't say if I'll ever return to this location it was so exhausting. We had two kids with us under the age of 7 and they both became very uneasy and irritable because they were even thirsty or hungry or tired of waiting. And a pregnant woman too. It was exhausting for ALL of us. I hope they really do fix this issue. Don't wish this on anyone. Everything we got was a process. A loooooong process. Not the drinks tho just everything else. I hadn't leave early to get to work but before we had to wait more than 30 mins for the bill.

Her reply to me was ""we'll seat you as soon as possible.""  I looked at the other host and said, I said you never called Steve. His response was we'll seat you as soon as possible. No apologies, no I'm sorry or anything. They both acted as if they were dismissing my concern.  We decided to stay because we were hungry. After being sat 5 minutes later we were seated.

We ordered a classic burger that was so black, it didn't even resemble meat of any kind.  Nor did the lettuce they put on top that was so brown and wilted.  House sirloin steak was literally about 2 1/2 inches in size and thought it must be either a joke or a child's portion.  The asparagus that came with it was so overcooked, the poor stalks were limp and bent over.  And don't even get me started on the chicken club sandwich, that was neither recognizable as chicken or a sandwich. Dry, stale, rubbery chicken, with none of the avocado or cheese it was promised, but did include more of the brown and wilted lettuce, because we just didn't get enough the first time on our burger.

36,David F.,"Concord, CA",53,375,1603.0,3.0,2016-12-11,"Stopped by recently on a late Friday afternoon after catching a movie in Pleasant Hill. I had been anxious to try the Concord BJ's clam chowder as the same dish in the San Rafael BJ's had been fantastic. When we got there we were seated immediately as there were plenty of open tables, more people being in the bar area. But the restaurant quickly filled up and by 6:15 it was packed and hopping. One thing we were surprised by was the lack of Holiday decorations, this being early December. A handful of poinsettias scattered around was the sole nod to the season. My order of the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl was as good as I remembered it. The chowder was excellent, and if possible, the bread was even better - freshly baked sourdough worthy of a meal unto itself! My wife had the Vegetarian Pita Tacos, and although the pita was excellent, the meal itself was too oniony. For dessert we decided to try their ""world-famous"" pizookie, which is a freshly baked cookie in a miniature round pizza tin, topped by ice cream and sauce. Not cheap at seven dollars, so we split the triple chocolate pizookie. We were somewhat disappointed by this world-famous dessert. The cookie was good, not great, and the chocolate ice cream was nothing special, tasting like grocery store ice cream.  The sauce, from Ghirardelli chocolate, was the high point. While we were eating a couple of large groups were seated in our area, and our server was tasked with the table of 12.

Let me tell you, I've been here about three times in my nineteen years of living and I've had bad experiences all three times, but let me tell you about the last time I went.  So my friends and I were hungry and Lucille's was closed so we decided to go to BJ's, that was our first mistake. We were seated promptly and everything was going okay until we got our food. There were four of us and NOT ONE item was cooked correctly. I got soup in a bread bowl, the soup was cold and the bread bowl was burnt, so burnt that I could not break into it with my teeth at all. One of my friends got an artichoke dip and the chips were stale and the dip was crusting/burnt, we didn't know how it was possible to screw up a dip but okay! My other friend ordered a pasta and it had NO TASTE, we all tried it and none of us could eat it. So we called the waiter over and complained, she had an attitude even though we kindly explained to her that this food was something that a dog wouldn't dare touch. I knew that she would be no help so I told her to call her manager. The manager came over and was kind enough to have our food remade. Two of my friends were so disappointed that they didn't want their food remade so the manager agreed to have the food that we didn't eat removed from the check. The second batch that came out was great, food that we should've got the first time around, but we were happy that they finally got it right. However, when it was time to pay for the check, all hell broke loose. Our evil waiter carried her attitude the whole night and almost exploded when we asked to split the check and remove the food that we didn't eat from the check (keep in mind, the manager previously agreed). On the way out, we asked for our change (that our waiter neglected to return to us) and the waiter literally starting YELLING about how much of an inconvenience we were. It was so embarrassing and I couldn't BELIEVE what was happening. Almost everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us and as much as we wanted our change, we couldn't stand the negative attention so we simply left. As someone who has worked in food service for almost four years, I couldn't understand how she could do such a thing to paying customers, and get away with it.

I stop in at this Concord location from time to time but it's not nearly the same trying to eat the Pizookie (cookie) dessert without her. However, I had dinner here with my boyfriend last night. We started with crispy portobello mushroom strips. For dinner, I ordered a soup/salad (chicken tortilla/wedge) combo and he had jambalaya. He also ordered a wedge salad to start. I asked that our salads be brought out together, thinking perhaps mine would be served with my soup, as an entree.  The appetizer came out and was delicious. Our server did an excellent job of keeping our drinks full and checking in on us. When we were almost done with the appetizer, my bf's jambalaya was brought out. No food for me, and no salads.  We told the girl who brought his plate out not to worry about his salad at that point, since he already had his entree.  However, a few minutes later my soup and salad, and his salad, were all brought out together. Even though we asked her not to bring his wedge, it remained on the bill at the end of the night. Kind of weird to serve a customer's salad after their entree and then still charge them for it after they say they don't want it anymore.  We had other things to do though and really did enjoy our server's good service, so instead of complaining and wasting time, we just left. Honestly, it's funny but the only part of our meals I didn't really enjoy was the salad. The chicken tortilla soup was excellent, and jambalaya very good too, but the salads were absolutely drenched in dressing and mine had almost no tomatoes on it while his was covered in chopped tomatoes.

114,Monica J.,"San Pablo, CA",1,3,1.0,2.0,2017-02-20,"After shopping at the mall for a couple of hours, my family and I worked up an appetite and decided to have BJ's for dinner. It was a Sunday evening so we imagined it would be somewhat busy but not 30 minutes wait-time busy (there were plenty of tables open from what we could see.)  Once we were finally seated, it took about 5 minutes to actually get a server come to our table. When he came back to our table with our drinks, he placed the drink on the uneven table and accidentally spilled my fathers drink and it fell all over his lap and phone. Luckily no damage, just a bit of stickiness, but we understand accidents happen. The bus boy was a great deal of help! After the spill ordeal, we were ready to order. The server had pens and notepads in his pockets but as we were giving him our orders, he never wrote anything down; pretty weird especially since it was a busy night and he was serving other tables but I just relied on his good memory I guess. My parents ordered soup and salad combos so their meals came out in a fairly average wait time. As my parents are getting through their meals, our server finally came with my plate but instead of the sirloin steak, he brought me a huge rib-eye steak. When I told him that's not what I ordered, he seemed confused and said that he could've sworn I said rib-eye and even look at his ""empty"" notepad.

The food comes out a bit slow, but if you're at the open bar, it is a bit faster. I recommend the open bar do to the fact that you can get seated faster.  The happy hours are clutch, and so are the BOGO meals (offered every so often).

205,Emily L.,"Martinez, CA",0,2,,5.0,2017-06-22,"I don't know why there are so many reviews about bad customer service at this location. I come here with a group of friends one to two times a week on average because they're the best. The food is not only fantastic and whether they mess up and bring you the wrong plate or they find something in the food. Accidents happen and it's a food establishment........ and they DO care and will handle your situation timely and appropriately but it's very rare that they do mess up because they're great! The service I would say is a big reason why we all choose to come back every week. You not only want to try everything on the menu because it is reasonably priced and looks great, but the way they treat you and care about you as a person not only a customer is hard to come by! Once you walk in the door you're most likely greeted by Katie the hostess with a welcoming smile and a genuine hello. Her and the other hosts/hostesses do their best to seat you in a reasonable time frame depending on the night you're dining with them always keeping you updated on the status of your wait and you can see them making sure you are taken care of. She really welcomes you and makes you feel like your business is really appreciated and it's a nice beginning to your night out! Once you're seated if you get Hailey as a waitress you are SETTTTTTT for a great dinner. One of the BEST waitresses I would say that I've ever had the pleasure in being helped by. She too will kindly greet you with a genuine smile and ask you how you're doing. She always makes sure that you have drinks, your food and that you are doing great overall. She also really cares about you as a person, always keeping a smile on her face as she asks you about your day and what she can do to make your visit great. You can also see her working extremely hard on the floor waiting several tables on a busy night but she never neglects one table over the other, making sure everyone is taken care of. Super professional but also funny and fun to have as a waitress! And even if it is a busy night she'll always be super generous, helpful and informative to you and your table because she wants you to have a great experience. Incredible service, go in and request if she's there you won't regret it. If you get Mia as a waitress you're golden as well because she too always makes sure that you're not only handled in a timely fashion but she lets you know that you're appreciated and that even though she's waiting other tables, when she's with you, you are at the top of her priority list. She also really knows what she's talking about when it comes to questions on the menu or anything in general and she again like Hailey always makes sure that you above all are doing good and enjoying your time. She's also extremely patient, looking at their menu can be tough because everything looks so good and she will help you sort out your options and offer to wait as long as you need to make your decision. There's no rush or pressure when you're being helped by her she's just super nice, fun and respectful. Wonderful service as well, definitely would recommend her too! Gabby as well is another great, fast and a wonderful server to have! She too is informative, nice, friendly and cares about you and who you're with making sure that you're not waiting too long and that you're always happy with your meal and your time in the restaurant. They're all so great at what they do, and make the experience of coming here so much more fun and overall better!  I have always had extremely positive and great experiences when I come here and I truly look forward to it every week as it has become a weekly meeting spot for my friends and I to come out on the days they have great deals which is basically everyday, seriously get out there and look them up, you will be there every week too they're so great. The service is wonderful and again is what makes us want to come back and look forward to returning week after week. They may have a few servers that are not as great, but that's what really makes you value your time with the hosts, hostesses, waiters and waitresses who are above and beyond at their job! Also if there ever is an issue remember that people make mistakes and that it's a food business where nobody is always perfect and they do handle any complaint or dissatisfaction timely and are truly sorry and offer you something in return to make sure again that YOU are happy. They're all human, cut a little slack on the harsh reviews, they do a fantastic job at this establishment. Go in and check them out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=200,2.12,2.6,2.652,2.7399999999999998,2.4080000000000004

268,Laney M.,"Alameda, CA",1,10,1.0,4.0,2017-07-31,"Went here on a date last night.   It was a Sunday night, the wait for the two of us was approximately 13 minutes.  It was bustling with activity, but still comfortable and fun.  Lots of groups, families, and couples on dates, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Our waitress was adorable, fast, and attentive, and laughed when we prodded her with our silly jokes, so she definitely had a good sense of humor.   We started off with the basic appetizer sampler platter.  After trying all of the options offered, I will definitely be getting either the Avocado Egg Rolls (fantastic dip), or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip w Tortilla Chips next time.  Mozzerella sticks were good enough to get an honorable appetizer mention.  The boneless wings were fairly bland, and not very original (kind of reminded me of the grocery store microwavable variety), so I don't recommend those.    As for my date, he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Burger.  His side choice was fries, and they give you a variety of options in the preparation - everything from an egg, to cheese, bacon, or even avocado / tomato.  I had a couple bites and thought it was fantastic, but he only made it halfway through the burger before filling up.  It really is A LOT of food, especially if you order the sampler first.     For myself, I ordered the House Top Sirloin, with sides of mashed potatoes, and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad.  Really cool artistic presentation of Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges, came on a separate plate.  The side salad could have very easily been its own meal if I had ordered it as a lunch by itself, very tasty because it was covered in basil, red onion, and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze that I wish I could get a bottle of at home to put on everything!    I ordered my Steak medium-rare, and they did it a little closer to medium, but it was still delicious and well seasoned enough that I did not need to order any sauces.    We had planned to get dessert, but we only made it halfway through our meals before we were full past our limits.  We got most of our food boxed up to take home, so there was definitely no room for that dessert!

They have draft beers and wine for less that $10, I think it was about $3-$6 per beer or wine. I know they also have cocktails on the happy hour, but I have yet to try one of them just because I don't really like mixed drinks.  As for their pizookie's... Orgasmic. I mean of course, you can make your own cookies and get some ice cream together. But it's not the same to me... The cookie is so moist and hot, it goes really well with the cold ice cream. They have oreo, chocolate chip, macadamian nut, red velvet flavors, etc... Red velvet is my favorite!  So far, the customer service has been great. I haven't had any complaints!

5,Colin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,183,168.0,4.0,2017-09-11,"I have a hard time understanding why all the BJ's get 2.5-3 stars. They're all well above average! I am a bodybuilder and a true foodie. After my competitions, I insist on going straight to BJ's because it's one stop shopping for me. I typically get a small pizza, ribs with double fries, and the Pizookie Trio. They're all very tasty. If I went to a pizza place, maybe the pizza would be better. If I went to a BBQ place, maybe the ribs would be better. But everything is very solid and I am someone who is somewhat critical of food.  The service was also friendly and prompt.  My wife and I we're waiting on four other friends so we sat in the bar area when we initially got there. It was a Saturday night so they were on about a 60 minute wait. While in the bar, Carlos waited on us. He was super nice and took really good care of us. We ordered soft drinks and chips and guacamole. The chips were good, the guacamole was OK. I added some salt and it made it three times better. Shortly there after, our friends arrived and we went and got seated where all six of us could comfortably sit. We ordered a bunch of entrées and all kind of tried a little bit of each other's. The calamari was good, the bison burger was good. I thought my ribs were really good as always. The pizza was also very tasty per the usual.  One thing that I did differently this time was that we as a table got the pizookie platter (I think it was called) which was absolutely amazing. After having dieted for 20 weeks, I felt like I could eat three of them. It is huge, though. 20 bites in and I feel like I'm going into a food coma and a sugar high.  Anyways, you get the point. I'm a big fan of this place. We live in Vegas and have been to 2 locations here and have also been to locations in SoCal and now NorCal. If you haven't been, go!

128,April B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,19,,2.0,2017-11-12,"I first experienced this place about a month ago at about 3:00 on a weekday afternoon when not many people were there.  I sat at the bar area for about 20 minutes, and no one ever took my order.  Lots of servers standing around socializing, though.  I asked to be re-seated in the main dining area where I was promptly served.  The food was okay, so I decided to give it another chance.   Fast forward to today, Sunday early afternoon with a 10-15 minute wait. I took my mother and her roommate.  Both are in their 80's and live in an assisted living facility.  One walks with a cane and the other with a walker.  Both are obviously frail. No one seemed willing to give up their seats in the waiting area, so I asked the greeter if there was somewhere my mother and her friend could sit while we wait for our table.  The greeter said she would get 2 chairs.  I waited a few minutes and asked again, as it appeared she had forgotten.  She had not forgotten and said she'd take care of it.  She never did, and she never asked her co-workers for assistance. I approached another worker for assistance who told me that another man had approached the manager and was taking care of it. That other man was a customer who had watched the entire interaction.  He carried the chairs over and seemed just as disgusted as I was.  Meanwhile, the greeter that I initially approached remained oblivious.  When we were finally called to be seated, they seated us in an area near the bar that required going up steps. No harm was intended, but I was irritated by this point, especially since there were lots of empty tables in the main dining area with no steps.  We were re-seated, and the service was decent from that point on.  For that reason, I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. This is a place that clearly caters to much younger, able-bodied people.  What a sad statement about their service.

As far as drinks, I know this is a brewery but I'm not so much of a beer person so haven't tried any of those yet. But i have tried the mixed drinks and they are just not good at all. They're definitely on the weaker side. I got the margarita that was flat and then got a Long Island to try to get a buzz, and nothing. It's like the drinks were virgin and had no alcohol in them.

They were just ok. I wish I would have got the Brussels sprouts instead. That will be something to try for next time. My friend had the brisket burger and an Alabama Sunset. The plate looked good for the price and the drink was pretty strong and had a really good taste. We ended our dinner with a mini monkey bread pizzookie and I have to say that it was the best part.

I'll start with the positive: drinks & food we're good. Table was clean.  Negative. Where do I start? From the server to the lack of customer service to waiting for plates and napkins and water! Totally ignored all night and our server clearly had some personal problem going on. We never could find him.  Our server was overwhelmed because all we saw him do was run ( literally running)  around the restaurant but not actually pay much attention to any tables. Ours especially. We were so ignored the whole night. Any request we had was always forgotten until we asked 2-3 more times. He seemed annoyed and flustered. My friend and I have worked in restaurants and retail so we can understand being overwhelmed however when we really looked around half his section was empty. We could hear other tables upset with his service and clearly he was paying attention and fooling around with one table more than the rest of ours.  Finally we get our check after being here for over 2 hours and we waited another 30 minutes just to PAY!! I flagged down someone else and she said she couldn't do it so finally we went to the front and pleaded for us to be able to pay so we could leave.   I don't even think the guy noticed we left the table he was hiding in the back so much.  I will never return here after this. Never. I'll chop my arm off before I come back here!

The last one i went to is in Cupertino and I remember getting good service and food. I believe that this location in Concord has room for improvement. It's by no means smaller or less busy than other locations. We usually sit in the bar area which has nice big screens. Since service is a hit or miss, we prefer the bar top so to get timely attention.  Food quality needs significant improvement and servers need to check back faster after food is dropped. I used to love their pizza but lately it's not been good and I just don't know what to expect. There were chunks of chicken of varying sizes in pizza. Once I got buffalo chicken pizza and it had bbq sauce in it. Jambalaya and Avocado egg rolls didn't disappoint though.  For drinks, it's safe to stick to beer which BJ's does well.

The issues with the customer service experience begin at the start of entering the restaurant. The very last time I went, we put in our name and number and were told to expect about a 20 minute wait. About 30 minutes went by and we decided to check and see where our name was on the list. They very clearly had no idea what we were talking about, and instead of admitting a possible mistake, they ignored us. I assumed they were just going to discuss with the waitress if there any availability so I sat down and waited. A few minutes later they took us to a table and gave us our menus. Now, the service to get our orders taken has been consistently unacceptable. It was 10 o'clock at night and the restaurant was only about a quarter full, yet it took 10 mins for the waitress to simply take our drink order, and about 45 mins for the food to arrive. Now, the exception I have is the food has always been phenomenal. I have ordered many different things off their wonderfully extensive menu and they all have been delicious as well as reasonably priced. It is why I keep coming back despite the poor customer service. After we finished our meals, our waitress was no where to be found, and all we wanted was our check. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until midnight. My suggestions would be to give waitress smaller sections so they can dedicate more time to their tables. The food here is great and if you improve on your customer service and being more present/available to the customer, I would frequent this restaurant much more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=20,3.08,3.04,2.812,,3.0560000000000005
