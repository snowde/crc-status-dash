391,Bobby L.,"Corona, CA",36,33,5.0,1.0,2012-01-26,"The food here is fine, just like any other BJ's.  However, this restaurant gets one star strictly because of the management.  I'm originally from NYC, so sometimes on Sundays, I like to watch the Jets somewhere if I choose to not watch them at home.  I attended BJ's a couple of times and had a decent time except for one Sunday when I was denied a request to have one of the televisions switched to the Jets game.  I made a simple request to have the Jets game on one TV, as it was the only game not shown all throughout the restaurant.  The server returned to my table and said that he cannot fulfill my request, so I asked to speak with a manager.  The manager came by and repeated what the server said, saying that she can not switch the channel.  I was a bit confused and really taken back by this, so I simply asked why.  The manager, a disgruntled woman, told me that they only have seven receivers and there were eight games on at the time, so earlier in the day, they decided to exclude the Jets game.  I then politely asked if she can switch the awful game between two last place teams that nobody was watching and she replied, ""no, we've already made our decision and it's not going to change"".  I then asked, ""So you're telling me that you're denying an actual request from a guest to switch from a game that nobody here is watching?"".  Her reply?  ""Yes, sorry"" as she walked away.  Clearly, if proper customer service can't even be implemented from the top, then this location is going to suffer.  They certainly will not receive any of my business anymore, that's for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=380,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.116,3.2000000000000006

The only food worth ordering is pizza or burgers & there are many other burger & pizza places to go. 2. Asked the waiter if they could grill the ahi on my salad a little more and he said ""it comes to us this way"" so it's right out of a package I assume. 3.

The pizzas aren't my top favorite but they're yummy. the cocktails are good and so are the beers. Spinach cheese dip is bomb and the spinach stuffed mushrooms were also delightful. My fiance has ordered the crispy jalapeno burger which he said was good but not great. What I really loved and appreciated greatly from our last visit was our server who was awesome to began with, when we informed him our medium rare burger was very well done, got us not only a new burger but it was also taken off the bill and he told us management offered us dessert. So free burger and brownie, I was so blown away and of course we tipped very generously. I wish I could remember his name, a tall blonde gentlemen fairly young, just great all around. Changed my view on BJ's since my first visit years ago which  resulted in a suspicious added credit card tip after I knew I tipped 20% with cash, everything was fixed.

305,Susan M.,"Corona, CA",127,294,96.0,4.0,2012-05-26,"We have been to this BJs many times and always had a good experience. 3.5 stars would be just right if I could give that. I almost always order the Sweet Pig mini pizza, which is so good! The perfect mix of cheese, sweet pineapple and salty Canadian bacon. I always ask for a side of ranch for dipping. A few times I ordered a loaded baked potato (butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese and bacon) which I really like also. The potatoes are HUGE!! Just one is a full meal! I have tried some of their beers, which are all good. But I actually prefer their freshly made root beer served in a cold, frosty mug - yummy! Tonight I opted for a change and got the bacon cheeseburger. It came with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, and dill pickles. I opted for mayo instead of the special sauce which had a little kick to it which I did not like. It was a decent burger, but it was dry and lacked the juice I like it a good burger. I got the wedge fries with it, which I think are better than the shoestring fries. My husband also had the burger and agreed that it was a little dry.  This burger and an okay brunch that I have also tried lower the stars for me. It would be a 5 based on just the pizza and root beer! We had great service from Katherine. She was very attentive and we did not have to wait to long for our meal. (And it was a Saturday night!) We have never had a problem with good service in either the bar or restaurant. We did not have a pizookie tonight, but have tried several in the past. Our favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut! I also like the Ghiradelli chocolate one. They are so tasty!

355,S Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,93,4.0,2.0,2012-08-06,"I hate to do it to this place but we didn't have a great experience there and really I want to give them 1 star but I don't think it would be fair.  To sum it up, our server forgot to place our dessert order, then took a guess and put in the wrong order, and 40 minutes later comes and tells us ""I took it off your bill sorry, if you wait 5 more minutes the right order will come out"" and I told her ""It's not about the money."" Which it's NOT about the money, because I would rather have paid the $5.95 and had our dessert, taking it off the bill is not going to give me my 40 minutes back.  Anyway she was completely apathetic, my husband wanted the dessert so we twiddled our thumbs for another 15 minutes during which she didn't even stop by to give us an update on the dessert, finally my husband decided to just leave.  Even just typing it makes me mad again, mostly because of her attitude.  It is unfortunate but one person with bad customer service can ruin it for the whole restaurant (and this serves true for any other establishment where customer service is important, like even your doctor's office or something for example). To be fair, we ordered the avocado egg rolls, watermelon salad, mozzarella and tomato salad, and all of those were truly good.  My husband got the Kwak beer which was great beer.  That is the only reason I will bump them from 1 to 2 stars.

Friday's and Chili's in terms of its family chain sit-down restaurant approach, prices and menu, which features several cuisines.  There are a few differences though.  BJ's has a heavy focus on deep dish pizza though it is definitely far from what you would also get in Chicago.  There is also a heavy focus on the brewery, which even features housemade sodas like cream soda and root beer.  Finally, it also seems more sports bar oriented with huge flat screen TVs sitting over the bar. I've only been to one BJ's in Torrance.  The food there is okay--kind of depends on what you order.  Service tends to be good there.  Sometimes, service is a little off or slow, but the management is always ready to make things right (even being very aware of when customers are receiving slow service and doing what they can to fix it). We had the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which were garnished with napa cabbage, red onion, carrots, cilantro, and mango salsa.  These were just okay at best.  The shrimp was not that good. I went with the Maui glazed pork chop, which consisted of a pork chop with a sweet glaze, oven roasted red potatoes, green beans, and grilled sweet red onions.  I've had this pork chop at the Torrance location a few times and it definitely trumps this one in Corona.  The pork chop here was not too bad; it was a little dry, but it was okay overall. The sides were not that good.  The green beans were limp, bland and lifeless.  The red onions did not have a good crispiness or char to them.  The oven roasted red potatoes were really bad.  They were underseasoned, but worse was that they had that squishy taste and texture of oven roasted potatoes you would get from a Lean Cuisine meal or something. Service was not that good either.  While the staff was pleasant and polite, they were not that attentive.  Also, it took a little too long for the food to come out. Prices were similar to what you would find at most family chain restaurants.  They do offer reasonable weekday lunch specials. BJ's is not my favorite chain, but this is a weak location.  The food was not that great (same could be said for the service).  There are a lot of chains in this area so my suggestion would be to seek out other nearby places before settling on BJ's. This BJ's is located in a huge retail plaza, which has its own free and huge parking lot; it is easy finding an open space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=280,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.3120000000000003,2.48

Sure enough the wait wasn't long, so they weren't all that busy. That was the only good service we got that night.  Our first waitress got 2 of our drinks wrong, when our second waitress got there she rolled her eyes when I told her about the mistakes. Then she questioned my drink order and didn't look too happy when I pointed to the menu and showed her that I did pronounce the drink correctly. It took forever to get the new drinks, took forever to put our order in, some of the food was cold when it got to the table and some of the plates were wrong.

I recommend that they replace the staff with more qualified employees and stop and actually take customers orders and care. We are tipping you for a reason.

That brings me to a 3 star average, but something changed last night.  We had a server named Leo who was the best thing that has happened to this location since it opened.  Maybe it's under new management or maybe they just got lucky with this guy, but if we go back, we'll wait to be seated in his section.  My 10 year old daughter wanted to find the manager and tell him/her to give Leo a promotion.  So for your regulars who deal with crappy service because a Pizookie is calling your name, don't fret.  Look for a dude with a big brown curly mane that resembles a Leo and you'll be set.

There have been several instances where they make themselves scarce. Now I like the food, and especially the pizookie, but out of the 6 times I have been here, only once have I had a waiter worth the tip I gave (I usually tip 30%), so the last time I went I lowered the tip to 20% and left a note complaining about the service. I haven't been there since, there are food places nearby with food that tastes just as good, but I don't rate a restaurant based only for the food, it's really about the service and ambiance, otherwise I might as well just get take out.

The plates had leftover food (some sort of mayo sauce) all over them. It took a couple of minutes to flag down the manager and even longer for them to bring out clean plates. The next incident occurred when our meals were brought out. One of our family members received the wrong order and had to sit and watch everyone else eat while he waited for his food. When his food finally did come out it was brought out in pieces. He was first brought his steak, then his soup and then his scallops. This was totally unacceptable. Our server made several excuses for her error saying that she couldn't read her hand writing  because she was writing too fast, that no one had ever ordered this particular menu item before and that she was brain dead because she just took a history final. The final straw came when the check was handed to us. Upon review we found that we were charged for an additional drink (one that they had told us they had run out of no less).

281,Chris R.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,14,6.0,1.0,2015-03-20,"Let me start by saying, I LOVE the BJ's by my in laws in San Diego and the one in San Bernardino. However, this one is one of the worst run restaurants I've seen. I'll just dive in. We visited this BJ's onThursday March 19th shortly after noon. I suggested going here to meet my grandmother and was embarrassed when she bit down on a lettuce core that was two inches in diameter. My tacos were bland like most the food we had on this visit. I got the grain salad I love with the chicken tacos, which is normally full of corn and really flavorful. In this case it was a single boiled grain with no dressing, no corn, no anything else.  All of this can be chalked up to being only human, mistakes happen, etc. I really understand these kinds of mistakes, though with proper expectations, standards and enforcement they can be avoided.  My real issue is this, and I hope management is listening. We were there another 30 minutes and even though I made eye contact with the manager the mistakes were brought to, at no point did any manager or supervisor make any effort to apologize or to offer me a replacement. I didn't need or ask for any discount even though I didn't eat half my meal, but a 30 second acknowledgement or something would have avoided this review and my not going to the restaurant again.

The last few times were just okay and this last time, on May 1, was absolutely the worst. My family decided to order in and since we are a somewhat big group we decided to try their family carry out meals. We ordered the portion size suitable for for 4-6 people. Decided to get the two large pizzas, the Santa Fe salad, mashed potatoes and potato wedges. We also added an order of mozzarella sticks since we love them so much.  We picked everything up and took the 5 min drive home, literally 2 exits away. We set up the table and sit down to eat. Try and get a slice of pizza and notice that it cold..... On top of that it was cut horribly and the crust was not crunchy but seemingly undercooked. It doesn't stop there. There was no sauce.... Very dry. We received ONE SCOOP of mashed potatoes for 6 people? A small one person serving of wedges... Really? And my favorite mozzarella sticks were smushed and cold..... I called in after trying to eat the meal and instead of telling me they would remake the meal I was told i would get a call back. After the food basically went into the trash...$70 worth of food. The manager finally calls me back to apologize and tell me they would give me a $20 voucher to come back. I asked if they could return some money to the card and she said they had already closed the tab and couldn't do it... So in a nutshell, I am very disappointed and will not be returning.

However, The entrées were extremely greasy and oily. My husband ordered the California burger, his usual, and he took one bite and said that he couldn't continue eating it because it literally made him physically ill to eat it. My husband has an iron stomach so I knew there was a problem. I tried it and nearly got sick myself. As much as we hate taking back food, we told the server, and she was extremely nice and offered the menu but my husband had lost his appetite. The rest of our food was great, but the next day, we all felt the after effects; I guess the rest of the food might've been overly greasy too. The manager came to our table to ask about the entrée, and she offered the menu as well, in addition to removing the California burger from our bill. Again the service was fantastic and the people are extremely nice, but, at the risk of sounding slightly pretentious, the food preparation on this particular day was subpar.

Who doesn't ask if the person is done before touching their plate, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S STILL FOOD ON IT! He put it all the way on his tray with other dirty dishes and moved on to the next table before we could get his attention that he wasn't finished with his dish!

Then she comes out to tell me ""I'm sorry we are out of linguine so is angel hair pasta ok for your Alfredo dish??"" Very annoyed but again I'm trying to keep a smile on my face for my sons sake. At the end of our meal she offers us free pazookies. We were full & honestly tired & ready to go so we declined. I handed her my sons award so she could remove his meal off our bill & she didn't acknowledge it. I'm not saying she needed to do cartwheels but my son is 7 & in the first grade, the least she coulda did was say wow you must be really smart!!! Congrats!!"" But nope nvr said anything...My real issues is the manager never once came over to reach out to us personally & apologize for the experience we had.  Our waitress just brings out bill back with 1 appetizer waived & my sons meal was waived which in my opinion shouldn't count as compensation because he was already getting his meal free. 1 appetizer taken off wasn't enough. But I accepted it just so I could get out of there as quickly as I could. 2nd experience I went here yesterday to celebrate my niece's high school graduation.  We sat outside & our waiter Ryan was extremely rude. He came off like he didn't want to be at work at all. Didn't smile, didn't ask if we were celebrating anything no nothing. Only nice thing he did was offer to split our checks into as many checks as we needed. But just his service was very dry & short. My family thought maybe it was just us because we were a big party & he was annoyed because of that, so we kinda started looking around and noticed him at another table there were 3 Asian girls sitting next to us & we saw him hand 1 of the girls a small box then she said something to him like maybe something was wrong with the box then he snatches the box from her then walks away & gives her another box without saying anything, didn't even look at her when he handed it to her then walks away again. Then all 3 of their mouths dropped to the floor like ""Omg what is his problem??"" So it was at that moment we knew it wasn't anything personal against us he was just rude. Luckily for us his shift ended before we got our food & another young lady took over who was PERFECT!! Very sweet & smiled a lot. Definitely a breath of fresh air.  I really hope the manager reads this, his/ her staff needs work, so much so that I'd rather drive all the way to the rancho location where I've never had any issues.

I'll admit the past year or so the service has gone down tremendously so I barely go. Tonight I remembered why I stopped coming.  My friend and I went for dinner. I ordered a mini cheese pizza and she ordered Cajun pasta. My pizza came with pepperoni, which I don't eat. I had to have it sent back and remade. While we waited for our food, we had to literally ask 3 servers to give us utensils which is ridiculous! It should not take 3 servers to give us a fork. We remained patient while already being extremely irritated and restless waiting for the correct food to arrive. While we waited, my friend asked for red peppers from a waiter. The waiter didn't seem to concerned to serve us because she started chit chatting with other waiters and servers for a few minutes before coming back with the peppers.  The waiter that finally brought us our utensils had the manager come to our table so we could address our issues. The manager apologized for the poor service but didn't seem to care about what we had to say. He seemed more annoyed that we were rightfully complaining.  The correct pizza finally came, which took much longer than necessary. I overheard the table next to me complain and show frustration about how long it was taking to receive their food. Anyhow,  my friend took a bite into her pasta and it was UNCOOKED!! LITERALLY UNCOOKED PASTA!!! UNBELIEVABLE!  Clearly we finally had enough and told the waiter. He wanted to bring the manager to us but we said not to worry about it because we don't care to be there another moment longer and aren't paying for such horrible food and service. We walked out.  I will no longer be visiting this location and will make a point to tell all my friends and family not to visit either.

For a Saturday night, it's typical to have a 30-40 minute wait for a booth, so while we were waiting, we had already picked out which pizza we wanted. We had awesome seating facing the bar and all of the main TVs. We ordered the BJ's favorite and the gourmet Mac and cheese. As expected, it took a little bit for the pizza to come out--but it was alright since we were having a good conversation and periodically watching all the games that were on. Anyways, right as we got the pizza, my boyfriend asked me, ""didn't we order the Mac and cheese?"" So after that we flagged down our waiter and asked him about it: he forgot to put it in. He apologized and immediately put it in, and it came out quickly. The pizza and the gourmet Mac and cheese definitely hit the spot!  Usually waiters ask about dessert before you finished your meal, but we were already close to being done and we had to flag him down to order the mini trio pazooki. It also came out quickly, but I was sad that all of them were hard, as if they were in the oven too long or were sitting out for too long. He later came back and asked how it was and I told him how I felt about it and he was very accommodating saying that if we had the time, they would redo our order. We really appreciated it and also felt bad for wasting food. But when the new order came out, it was ooey gooey delicious.

214,Ronald M.,"Riverside, CA",77,1,,2.0,2015-09-09,"Stopped in to have a celebratory dinner with my wife for getting accepted into a university today. The evening was going great until we stepped into this store. Before i rant i must say that im an avid fan of BJ's and this experience will not stop me from enjoying Bj's atmosphere and food. Upon being sat it took our waitress 15 minutes to come greet us. This is unacceptable for a franchise of this magnitude. Upon finally greeting us she explained that she did not realize that we were sat in her section and that she was sorry. I believe that this issue could have been alleviated if this store implemented some type of teamwork among the servers, cover down when a server is MIA. Moving forward to our meal; everything was fine with the exception of our waitress not being attentive and only coming by once to fill our glasses with water. However, i did notice that our waitress is a social butterfly and preferred to hang out in the front of the restaurant with the hostess and other servers conversing. heck i even saw one of the managers partaking in the conversation while customers are suffering from poor customer service. After finishing our meal we had to go look for our waitress (who was aptly at the front of the restaurant conversing with co-workers) to get a to -go box. Once we got our to go boxes we ordered desert the three sampler pazookie. Our choices for the sampler were salted caramel, PB&J, and Triple chocolate easy order right? wrong she managed to mess up our desert order by assuming that we said chocolate chip pazookie instead of the triple chocolate like we asked for. Upon noticing that she brought us the wrong order i once again had to go to the front of the restaurant and find our server who was having a stimulating conversation with the hostess. I told our server that she gave us the wrong order, ""where she stated i heard chocolate so i assumed chocolate chip"". However she went to the back and put in the correct order. Upon finishing our desert we once again had to go find our waitress to receive our check. My question is why is a diner constantly looking for their server are servers not properly trained at this establishment? I know they are at the Cerritos C.A. and Centennial Hills location in Las Vegas. Moreover, needless to say this was my most absolute worst dinning experience with this company. Our waitress Kaley P. should tend more to the customers in her assigned stations instead of conversing with other co-workers, it will financially benefit you in the long run with better tips. However, i know B J Brewhouse will not over look this review and start to demand that servers at this location act professionally to prevent negative customer reviews.

104,Marlene J.,"San Diego, CA",339,270,1115.0,2.0,2015-10-01,"Although it's not too far from my fiancé's residence, we wouldn't normally come to BJ's Brewhouse Restaurant.  My stepson and daughter-in-law with whom we haven't seen for some time, however, invited us here for dinner.  For that, we were most appreciative.   Still, my fiancé insisted that I not forget to submit a bad review for this place.  So, here goes.... The dinner started off well.  Our waiter was pleasant and took our appetizer orders quickly.  We ordered Chicken Wings, California Club Flatbread Pizza, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  All were good. Us adults busily yacked away, catching up on each other's lives, while taking nibbles here and there of our appetizers, not paying attention to how much time had passed since we had first put in our dinner orders.  It wasn't until our 7-year old granddaughter nudged me away from our conversation and look at me with her big, doe eyes of hers, that I noticed that almost a full hour had passed.  She asked, ""Grammy, when is our food coming?  We've been waiting soooo long and I hate waiting so long, when I'm hungry.""  Guilt-ridden from not putting both of our granddaughters' needs before ours, I quickly searched for our server.  I diverted their attention by having them color in the objects on their paper menus, so that Grammy could judge their artwork.  Our meals finally arrived.   My granddaughters' kids' meals arrived first.  Immediately, they began to stuff themselves, burning their delicate little tongues, since the Mac 'n' Cheese and Happy Face Potatoes came without a heat caution.  The adult meals, on the other hand, arrived at room temperature.   Our runners kept switching along the way and, as a result, they were rushed and didn't know who ordered what.  We had to keep trading all of our plates with one another. My fiancé had ordered a Medium 12"" BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza for $20.95 all for himself, with the intent of taking home the leftovers to eat the next day.  The dough was cold and he couldn't  detect any tomato sauce.  He only ate two  forgettable slices and asked for a To-Go box for the remainder.  Isn't BJ's known for their pizza and whose 'Favorite' was it anyway?   Not my fiancé's, at this point.  He actually threw the pizza away when he got home.  $20.95 down the drain. The handcrafted burgers on the menu had caught the eyes of my stepson and mine.  I had looked forward to biting into their NEW Portebello Swiss Burger.  Since it was priced high at $12.95, I had expected it to taste like a gourmet burger.  It did not.  It was as if it had been 'fire-grilled' several hours prior.  I was unable to detect the taste of carmelized onions (though I saw them), balsamic vinaigrette, and garlic aioli that was advertised.  My burger was served with a large helping of thin-cut fries that were neither hot nor crispy. My stepson had their NEW Fully Loaded Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe Burger for $11.95.  He's a man with few words, but you could just tell by his expression that he felt indifferent about his burger, leaving half of it untouched.  Understand that my stepson is a large, 6', part Samoan CAL-Firefighter with a ferocious appetite (usually), who just returned three days ago from fighting the explosive wildfires in Northern California, wanting to take his father and his fiancée out to what he thought would be a nice dinner.  I don't recall what burger my daughter-in-law ordered, but she was equally unimpressed.  We finished off at least portions of our burgers, not because we enjoyed them, but because we had all saved ourselves for dinner and was hungry enough to eat just about anything that was put in front of us. Another runner interrupted us, with two plates of appetizers in hand.  ""Alright.  Who ordered some Wings?""  Wrong table.  He went onto the next table over and it wasn't theirs either.  The error had prompted a discreet remark from my fiancé that those same $9.95 BJ's Premium Wings we had eaten at the start of our meals tasted better than all of our individual dinners combined.  We should have just lied and said they were ours. At least the dessert was promising because we each ordered individual Pizookies, which BJ's is also well known for.  Our table hadn't been cleared off by the time our Pizookies arrived at the table though.  So, we stacked our dinner plates atop each other ourselves to make room, while a different runner passed out our chosen desserts incorrectly once more. We decided the next time we planned a Catch-up dinner, WE would be the ones to treat,...but select another spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=100,2.72,2.9,2.9,2.504,2.8280000000000003

I live in San Diego so usually go to the ones down there; however, my mom lives in corona so today we decided to do take out from BJs from this location. We ordered our food online and then proceeded to pick it up. When I got there the lady was very nice.  She read me back my order and said she'd be right back with it.  We sat waiting for 20 minutes for the food to take home.  And I thought oh it's still cooking so that must've been why it was taking so long.  She handed me the bags.  Forgot our drinks.  Then I get home, open the bags... Come to find cold food, incorrect orders, and honestly I was really disappointed.  I got a chicken pesto sandwich. It was cold. Not toasted bread ( also very soggy) and probably had an ounce of chicken and the rest was pure bread. The fries tasted four days old and were cold. I could keep going on about everyone else's food but I'd rather not. I was just really disappointed because bjs has always been one of my favorite restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=280,2.68,2.86,2.86,2.8880000000000003,2.7880000000000003

People were complaining left and right, and food was coming out cold or burnt. Instead of the manager waiting to seat people, the hostess continued to seat people which the servers didn't even have time to greet nor take tables orders. It took my server 20 min just to take my drink order and by the time my food came (1.5 hrs later) my family's food was burnt! Today is not as bad, but still a disappointment. I came to enjoy the weather and sit outside with my family. I saw the outside patio tables and just about all the empty tables still had used cutlery on them. The server looked overwhelmed to stop and grab some plates. When the busser came outside, she snapped on him to grab some plates, but still about a good two tables left because they had been sitting at their tables for awhile waiting to be helped.

154,Rose A.,"Orange County, CA",55,41,,3.0,2015-11-10,"Service: 2.5 - 3 stars. Our waiter literally threw over/tossed down the coasters for the drinks we ordered vs. simply placing them flat onto the table and setting our drinks atop. It sounds like a small thing, but it set the tone, which was way too informal and (word from my boyfriend, who is hard to offend) ""classless.""  This was also done without any formality or humorous comment, which might've made it more acceptable. The waiter just walked off after. Also, the olives in my boyfriend's martini came 10 minutes after the waiter brought our drinks, in a separate cup (?). Overall just seems like some of the staff need training in hospitality etiquette. Food: 3 stars. We ordered salads and pizookie so it's hard to say whether the food here is great or not.

She asked if we could wait 10 more minutes and they would have it out for us. They apologize and bring us salads while we wait and even dessert after our meal, everything turned out to be on the house. 2nd time: My boyfriend and I go for Sunday lunch to get clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl, well by the time my boyfriend had reached the bottom of the bowl, he realized it had mold. The manager apologized and paid for our meals and gave us a $25 gift card. 3rd time (tonight): we ordered a pizza and our waiter didn't bother bringing the pizza stand or plates so the girl who brought the pizza realized we didn't have utensils so she had to carry the pizza back and forth with her so she could grab a pizza stand and plates. Then we told the waiter they didn't put mushrooms or olives on the pizza, so he brings out refrigerated mushrooms and olives on a plate. Who the hell wants cold mushrooms and olives on their pizza?!

We were seated after 20 minutes of waiting and soon after, my friends and I have noticed that amongst the plethora of servers here who were bustling around helping all the customers around us, they had failed to even serve us. Finally after a good 30 minutes of glaring at the servers in hopes to catch their attention, one server took notice of our table that was situated right in the middle of all the other tables (which is why I'm surprised that the others did not notice our table for almost half an hour).

We were sat at a dirty table, there were still napkins in the booth, very visible crumbs, and a sticky as hell table. I immediately asked the hostess if she had someone who could clean the table. She said someone would be over to do that, well this girl passed by us at least 3 times and we were still sitting at a dirty table. About 10 minutes passed before anyone came to the table, and at that point it was the waitress who was asking for our drink orders. She apologized profusely, but it was just kind of annoying to be sitting there for such a long time. That is the only time that has happened but it seems that we are almost always leaving bjs a little sadder than when we went in.

42,Darren H.,"Corona, CA",134,260,637.0,4.0,2016-06-05,"Typically I don't review the chain restaurants, but I had pictures stored of a previous visit and figured it was due time to at least give BJ's its due (well at least the cleaner of the two) Haha..ANYWAYS! I dine here every now and then and what I do enjoy is that periodically they do revamping of their menu, but at least still keep some of the previous crowd pleasers. I can tell they really did go health conscious in the last few years and even I have to tip a hat for that! On this outing I decided to go simple and by recommendation of the wife went for their avocado egg roll off the appetizer section. I was very impressed by the portion size as it's beyond generous for being an appetizer (quite enough for one person to pound or if you're after a toned bikini line then there's enough to fill up two tummies). I expected it to be greasy for some reason, but found it to be crispy and light in nature. Between the laundry list of ingredients in this concoction go figure the sweet tamarind sauce it's paired with sets the dish apart. It's a pleasant offset to the slight kick from the spice within the egg roll. Highly recommended! As for the main attraction, I admit at the $15 price tag it's a bit much for a pizza however it gave me that all important food wiggle so it was worth every penny. The Brewhouse Classic tavern cut pizza comes thin crust style which sends my taste buds into overdrive when well prepared and this was no exception. The pepperoni and sausage were juicy oddly enough and the mushrooms tasted fresh and not canned which is always a plus, but I wouldn't expect that from a restaurant style meal anyways. The five cheese blend gave it that extra added BANG leaving my stomach wanting a cigarette?!?

299,Myles R.,"Corona, CA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2016-06-30,"BJ's has always been one of my favorite restaurants to visit, usually guaranteed great service and great food. Unfortunately, my last visit was one of the absolute worst experience I've ever had in my entire life. When it comes to going out to restaurants, I totally understand all that goes on, due to my previous experience as a server, but our servers attitude was inexcusable. I was out to eat with a few friends of mine and our server, Ryan, came to greet us. Immediately he had an attitude asking us what we wanted to drink. We specifically asked for 2 Nojitos (Mojitos without the alcohol) and proceeded to bring them out to the table. We asked for Nojitos because we are underage and cannot drink along with the fact we were both driving ourselves. My friend thought her Nojito tasted strange, so she didn't drink any of it and waited for Ryan to come back so she could very politely return the drink. Ryan was not attentive at all and the few times he would come to check on us, he was very rude. Ryan came to drop off the check and as we went to pay our bill, we saw that we had been charged with alcoholic Mojitos. When my friend asked Ryan to remove the drink from her tab, he yelled at her telling her that she needs to speak louder in a restaurant that has music playing and to say a non-alcoholic Mojito instead of Nojito. I have never felt so disrespected as a loyal, paying guest in a  restaurant. The first mistake on his part was not asking us for our ID's to verify our age, which had that been done there would have been no confusion to begin with. He served alcohol to minors and was in the wrong, putting the blame on his guest. He was very rude and I will not be coming back to visit his location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=280,3.08,3.06,2.964,2.8200000000000003,3.0680000000000005

Anyway I tried to overlook it. We ordered dinner, just some bbq sandwiches with sides (they were good. nothing to write home about). Our waitress was starting to take her time when it came time to service our table and when she would come over, she would flirt with my boyfriend right in front of me. She would completely change her tone of voice and get bubbly around him then when it came to me *switch* straightface. Good thing my boyfriend is somewhat oblivious to that stuff. Anyways she brings us more chips and salsa and again! There is another sad chip in the salsa. Its not a big deal its just careless. So I'm rating 3 stars because it just seemed like all the staff there that night didn't really care to create a good experience that would make customers want to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=180,3.16,3.14,2.996,2.7,3.1480000000000006

I understand you want to better your team in the performance of of your restaurant, however, the choice and decision to cater to high school students and giving them the right and exclusive use of the patio dining area fall directly on your shoulders because it was a call management has made. In short, that is your fault. a good leader does not put blame on people who makes the company run. A good leader takes responsibilities. This is not just me as as a customer complaining. I took off 1 more star because you failed to acknowledge your own failure to address the main issue. Don't talk to your team yet. First you need to learn to listen.

As a single I was seated in the back section of the main dining room, but it appears no one had really been assigned to my table, as numerous servers wandered back and forth in front of me with none of them even bothering to ask if anyone had taken my order. When someone did actually notice me, she told me she was not really my server, but would take my order anyway.  How thoughtful.  She said the other server was too ""busy."" 2.  Started with a Watermelon/Basil Margarita that was so sweet and nasty tasting that I only drank a few sips. 3.  Ordered the Triple Decker sandwich which was indeed very good and MEATY. 4.  Fries came out stone cold!  Why does no once notice this fail?  Replacement ones were hot and yummy.  Who is supervising the line in the kitchen to make sure nothing goes out unless it is perfect? 5.  Ordered a large side of mayo for my sandwich and found an 8-inch piece of something purpleish in the bottom of the dish.  I mentioned this to my server, and shorlly a nice man arrived at my table asking what the issues were.  I can only assume he was a manager, but he never bothered to introduce himself.  WHY? To make a long story short, he took off 50% of the cost of my sandwich, but I still got stuck with the full tab for the nasty drink.....Not sure if I will be back until they lure me in with another coupon like in the past for $10 off on a $35 tab.....OR, their 2-for-1 entrees.....There are simply way too many places walking distance away, including Kings Fish House, Panera Bread, Buffalo Wild Wings, Romano's, Chilis etc. that all seem to have less challenges than I have experience over the years at BJ's.

First my boyfriend and I are seated, handed menus, waitress says she will be right back to take our drink order.... no problem.  But apparently, right back means 10/15 minutes- to ask what we want to drink.  She doesn't even look me in the eyes when I'm ordering, she's looking around saying 'uh-huh' like she thinks we are a waste of time.  She leaves, comes back literally 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks.  I let her know that this isn't what we ordered and she doesn't say anything, grabs the drinks, and leaves.  When she comes back to bring the right drinks, once she puts them down she immediately turns to leave when I have to stop her and let her know we have been ready to order.  We both make our orders, my boyfriend asks that his side salad come first.  10 minutes... 15... 20... finally, what comes out? Our meals.  Where is the side salad? Nowhere to be found.  Also, I had asked for extra croutons. What did I get? No croutons, like at all.  The woman who brought our food out was not our waitress but since our waitress had been MIA, we asked her about the side salad and croutons, said she would be right out with them. No one for 10 minutes.  At this point, we have seen our waitress at other tables asking about their meals, hasn't said a word to us.  Finally she comes over as we're almost done with our meals and we remind her about the side salad and croutons which no one has brought out. She looks at my boyfriend and says 'oh did you want me to bring out the salad still, like, now?'..... yeah, we want the side salad after the meal when we asked for it before?¿ I'll cut to the chase- she never brings it out.  My boyfriend has to walk to the kitchen area and ask some other male server to bring us our salad and croutons, after we have basically finished eating.  She never comes back other than to drop off the check.  Never refilled our drinks. I couldn't believe she actually charged us for the salad after that ordeal. She was so rude and treated us like we weren't worth anything.  I know that we look young, we're in our early 20's but that's no reason to treat us so poorly just because you don't think you'll get a big tip.  We always tip generously but this woman did not deserve a thing.   MORAL OF THE STORY- This is the last time we plan on visiting this location and if you're hungry and in the area, go to Kings or Wood which is right next door where you will be treated like a valuable customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=140,3.24,3.23,2.988,2.2760000000000002,3.234

130,Ed R.,"Corona, CA",0,17,1.0,2.0,2017-01-23,"I am puzzled as to why some well established Restaurants such as BJ's would provide low quality customer service. One would assume that an established restaurant chain such as BJ's would have excellent customer service but this was not the case at this specific restaurant.  I took a trip to this restaurant with my wife and son for a nice family lunch, it was approximately 2:30pm, so there was minimal customer there. We opted to sit at the bar area (in a booth of course since we had our son), we quickly sat ourselves since there were quite a few open seats, I will venture to say there were about 15 customers in this area. I assume we would get quick service but that was not the case. The couple that sat down 5 minutes after we did, were helped before we were, a mistake one would say and I can agree with that, but they had only one server for all 15 of us customer, Pathetic!!! What kind of manager would have one server for 15 customers (One that has no clue as to what they are doing or are simply trying to save on labor costs at the expense of service), she couldn't keep up with the demand. Needless to say the food was tasty but the since the manager would rather place profits over service I feel compelled to provide them the low stars. If the manager had any type of business acumen he would have shifted the staff around to provide adequate coverage for his customers, I failed to mentioned that there were 3 young ladies simply chatting away at the take out register, why couldn't the manager have one of them help our server? Yes, but since he/she doesn't know how to manage their staff the results are unhappy customers. The customer next to me tapped me and asked ""are you getting horrible service?""  If I was the General Manager I would have a good chat with my manager to understand what he/she is doing; lack of customer service can lead to a decline in sales thus leading to the demise of such an organization/restaurant. On my way out not one of the 3 young ladies told us by or have a great day, not even a thank you, but I don't blame the employees, I blame the manager who has failed to teach his employees how to treat customers, and if this is the type of culture that is fostered, its a matter of time before someone is replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=120,2.92,3.23,3.0,2.408,3.106

I love this place, & usually the staff is wonderful. The food is always great, I've never had a problem with that. But tonight seemed to be a different story. We got the text saying our table was ready, why? We aren't sure. We stood there while the host talked about the people getting up from the table and hopes that they were just going to sign the check real quick and get up. I'm sorry, there is people still sitting at the darn table, why would you tell us it's ready just to talk shit in front of customers about customers? Also, the bleach blonde hostess (also the one talking about the people at the table) that felt the need that it was her ""call"" on determining if the ""hot guy"" that was walking out as we were standing there was with a cute enough girl... apparently because she's sick of seeing ""hot guys"" with ""ugly girls"". Didn't realize it was in the hostess job description to determine that. We noticed a hand full of times after being seating, other people waiting to be seated while there's still people sitting at the table. Is that a thing now? I find it pretty rude to rush a paying customer in front of a paying customer waiting. She was extremely unprofessional specially for such a busy place.  I know it's a busy place, but we have always had wait staff that was on top of things (unless we sit outside) but tonight we saw our server 4 times(take our order, bring us plates, and bring us the check) one of those being we had to stop him to ask for water. Not sure if they were under staffed (which I totally understand if it was) or just not a good crew tonight. The bus boys were awesome though! Extremely pleasant, polite and on top of things.

5,Kevin D.,"Santa Ana, CA",268,133,27.0,4.0,2017-04-13,"I have dined at many BJs establishments and this is one of the best ones I've eaten at. That being said, your experience may vary depending on who is on staff at that particular time. I've eaten here with my family about 10 times since moving to Corona and there have been 3 visits where the experience was not ""excellent"" and 2 of those 3 times, the manager (I can never remember her name) has always gone above and beyond to rectify the situation to the best of hey ability. I do think that they may want to be more selective in who they hire, as some of the staff are a lot less professional than others. Despite the few negative experiences and open admission that I've been less than pleased with some of their wait staff, I still give this BJs 4 star because of their food.  The chicken strips are amazing. I always steal one of my son's chicken strips because it's so good. Real, juicy chicken, perfectly crispy breading... And only for $6 (for a kids meal), it includes drink and a side! You pay that price for 3 chicken strips at carl's Jr and get 1/4 the meat!  One of the best fish and chips I've had. I LOVE fish and chips. I do not claim to be an expert on fish and chips, however, but I can honestly say that the fish and chips here are amazing. I've tried a few places in Seattle, Orange County, and LA, and this place is still easily top 3. Amazingly crispy breading and juicy fish with no hint of fishiness (wife can't stand that).  Jambalaya is really good here. I haven't been to new orleans so that's my full disclosure, but I really like the cajun seasonings. Rice is perfectly cooked, and the andouille sausage had a nice kick.  They have a new prime rib promotion the last time I went and it was pretty good for the price. It's nowhere near lawrys, but it never claimed to be. For about $26, you get a 16oz hunk of prime rib, 1 soup or salad, 2 sides, and a pizookie!

I immediately contact the restaurant to speak with the manager. He was abruptly apologetic and said there was nothing he could do about the charge at this time and that their delivery driver did not come in today. My concern is that the website allowed me to place an order for this location AND charged my credit card, without once alerting that there is no delivery available on this date. The abrupt, insincere apology from the manager, with no offer for a resolution did not help. Won't try delivery service from BJ's again.

Our waitress was very nice and engaging with both, my daughter and I, so I didn't make a big fuss. Today was a different story. Our waitress Kayla seemed like she could care less that we were there, even though it was 4:30pm and we were her only customers. But when we asked for our check, I mentioned to her that I had points in my Premium Rewards Card and I wanted to use them, which amounted to $25 off my check. She came back and said that I only had $5 or $10 off. I explained to her that was not correct and she told me there was nothing she could do. That she could only take the amount allowed by the computer. Well, my husband and I asked to speak to the manager and she said that it didn't matter,  that the manager couldn't do anything about it either. I asked her to give me a minute and come back.

Since most Yelper's are familiar with the food, I'll focus on all the things that went horribly wrong.  Our party of 10 was seated at a long table and given menus, so far so good. The waiter then disappeared for 15 minutes and came back with a buddy. He introduced the other waiter and said ""you can blame anything that goes wrong on him."" Okay...maybe that was a foreshadowing of things to come. The new waiter took our drink orders and poof, didn't see him again for another 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, we're chatting and I feel a chubby drop of waiter hit my forehead. What the? I look around and don't see anything. Three minutes pass and another chubby drop plops on the table. Then I notice water lines and water drops around our entire group. Hold up! Unless that's a leaky beer tap, we have a problem. So the place is full of leaks and when I asked the waiter he smugly said ""it's just the air conditioner."" Ok, I get it, but I've never been to a restaurant with AC sweat plopping me on the dome. It was raining earlier that day so I actually think it's a leaky roof and ceiling.  Moving on, we finally got our food orders in after 30 minutes of waiting. The water arrived but still no drinks...this is really not the place for alcoholics. We remind the waiter and he says, oh you didn't get your drinks? Followed up with ""what did you order again?"" Nevermind dude! The food finally arrives and my pulled pork sandwich is salty AF. Sure would be great if I had a nice cold...doh!  In short, all aspects of the dining experience was awful.

Our server never came to check on us after we got our food though and a new server came over when we were almost finished eating and said our server had an emergency and had to leave so he was taking over which is fine but it took double the amount of time to cash out and leave because the new server was getting acquainted with this new station plus I'm sure taking care of his tables too. Besides the server change which is fine because I understand things happen but I swear the tables are not numbered or they are and nobody knows the numbers. Servers kept coming to our table asking if this was our food and then trying to give our food to the table next to us. Basically this place was a super disorganized. Also my husband ordered the jambalaya and he said it had way too much Cajun seasoning but of course didn't want to send it back, not like we ever got checked on to do so but he normally hates doing that anyways.

The thing that really bothered me was how awful the food was. I usually love eating here; I come plenty of times throughout the year but it just seems like the food isn't as great as I remember it. I decided to try something new - It was some golden crispy breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli - at least that's what was displayed on the menu. However, when the food came out the chicken had a rubbery texture and the outside did not have that golden crispy look to it. In fact it looked burnt and had a flat texture; no crispness to it whatsoever. The mashed potatoes were just ok. The best part of my dish was the broccoli! For a $16 plate I had 3 bites of the chicken and a couple bites out of the mashed potatoes.  I was starving but after tasting my food I lost my appetite. I was honestly really upset. Coming here for dinner honestly ruined my night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona?start=20,2.24,2.54,2.88,2.212,2.42

I ordered a couple of pizzas & bazookie for dinner for curbside delivery. Upon arrival I was notified that there was no record of my order. The manager was gracious enough to explain that since they didn't offer the bazookie the order wasn't processed. The only issue issue I have with this is that I was emailed an order number, if there was no record why did I have an order number emailed to me????  He was apologetic and admitted that there should have been some notification. Had it not been for the fact that I a hungry family, I would have walked out. It took my appetite, I ended up ordering one pizza instead of two. No discount or consideration for the mistake on their behalf. It defeats the purpose to enter email, and phone number and they have no system in place to notify me that one item in the order is not available, to give me the opportunity modify the order without driving to the restaurant! BJs you're better than that aren't you?  I gave you another opportunity after a negative experience, I'm done.  This was ridiculous.

We ordered blended house Margarita's which came on the rocks. Then ordered appetizer and dinner. As we were waiting we noticed chips on the floor in the waiting area and on the steps down onto the dining floor, after bringing it to the manager's attention he picked up most of the chip on the stairs.

The server came back with the appetizer (sriracha queso dip) maybe 6 minutes later and gave us another minute to look the menu over. Once we were certain what we wanted we ordered and waited approximately 15 minutes for our food. This is where the visit starts to go badly. A server -not our server- walks over with a salad, not ours. We tell him it's not for us and he gets upset and says ""whatever then"" and turns around and walks away. We sit here a little dumbfounded but let it go it was just an awkward little thing. As soon as that server walks into the kitchen another female server comes to our table and leaves 2 of those metal stands they put the pizzas on at our table -we didn't order pizza- we tell her this and she says ""ok??"" and walks away. At this moment the first server that wasn't our server comes back to our table now with a grilled cheese ham & cheese sandwich which is what I ordered BUT there were no fries and I had asked for mine with sweet potato fries. We again sit here a little confused and don't touch the food thinking they're maybe about to bring the fries out but that doesn't happen. There are 4 pickle slices on the plate, I eat one and my girlfriend eats 2. The plate is directly in front of me, I coughed once or twice and then put actual server runs up the table and says ""oh my goodness this is not for you!"" takes the plate and gives it to another patron sitting at another table with his family. I try to tell the server ""hey we ate some of that"" he cuts me off & says my food will be right out. We sit here again just sort of stuck in stupid DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN? Did he just give someone else food that we touched without saying anything!? My girlfriend is a chef by trade in the catering business and this made us question even being in the restaurant. Our food comes out this time both orders, both correct. We try to tell the server again before the man starts to eat the sandwich how they should replace it with a new one and he says ""oh it's fine"" NO ITS NOT  It just got worse from there.

20,Dan W.,"Anaheim, CA",145,499,506.0,4.0,2018-01-11,Went into this BJ's and decided to give it a try after all the disappointment at the BJ's in Anaheim Hills. The manager at this store should go to Anaheim Hills and straighten out the totally dysfunctional restaurant if you want to call it that. This BJ's had great service which was very surprising after all of my other experiences at the Anaheim Hills store.  When we got our order everything was surprisingly very hot and very good. The rest of the experience was really nice and we will be back to this BJ's for sure.   Even the french fries were hot at this location. We were so surprised and appreciated the service and food too.  We applaud the management and servers at this location as this is one of the better BJ's you will find.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona,2.84,2.58,2.884,,2.684
24,Melanie Y.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,5.0,2018-01-13,"Came here with my bf and brother. Ordered beers, an appetizer, wings, and pizza. Our waiter was Meghan...she was awesome! Our app came after our food, which was fine. We didn't mind. Then once it came out, she told us that the manager stated we can either get a dessert for free or they can comp the app. Since we were all full, we decided to comp the app.  Awesome customer service! Meghan, you're the best. Definitely will be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corona,2.84,2.62,2.896,,2.708
