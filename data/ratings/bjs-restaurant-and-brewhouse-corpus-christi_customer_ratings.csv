53,Edward S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",100,268,247.0,4.0,2013-10-06,"We were fortunate enough to attend the ""soft opening"" of BJs and so glad we did!  We'd never been to one - heard a lot about them, though. Now, I'm not a beer drinker, but our friends have been introducing us to ""crafted"" beers and BJs is the BEST place to sample those.  They actually have a sampler of 4 beers (similar to a ""flight"" at a wine bar).  You can go light or dark.  We did both. My favorite, though, is their own ""Oktoberfest"" dark beer.  GREAT flavor and I can tell I'll be a fan of beer from now on. They had a limited menu for the soft opening - starting off with an appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip with multicolored tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT!  The dip was creamy, hot, VERY tasty with chunks of artichokes.  Their entrée choices were the seared ahi tuna salad, a steak and bleu cheese flatbread pizza, a ""Maui glazed"" pork chop and a roasted turkey breast sandwich.  We tried them all and shared.  The standouts were the tuna salad and the flatbread pizza!!  Get an order each of those and it makes for an amazing dinner for two.   The sandwich was just a sandwich; nothing too thrilling there.....well, except for the seasoned wedge fries that came with it.  The pork chop had a great flavor but was a little tough.   The service is as impressive as the atmosphere.  Of course, this again was their soft opening so everyone's on their toes.  But, we still had a very good experience for our first time at a BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant.  We look forward to going back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corpus-christi?start=40,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

The Oktoberfest Beer was a good choice to drink. Also, the stuffed mushrooms were amazing as an appetizer. The waiters were great and they have this VIP program which we signed up for so we can get discounts and we won't have to wait in line for a table in the future. The food did take a while to get to us but it was due to the place just opening and it was packed. I had the Bold Bleu Flatbread Pizza and my wife had the Biscotti Chicken and it was great. Plus the bar area is huge. They also had the football game on all the t.v.'s they had spread out all over the place. Overall was a great experience and i recommend this place to everyone.

141,Cookie N.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,42,3.0,3.0,2013-11-29,"After hearing my Aunt rave about the root beer at BJs Brewhouse in Austin, I decided to try out the one here. I believe it just opened up a few/months/weeks ago. As we got to the entrance, we were greeted by our server, and given a good amount of time to choose what we liked. I chose the handcrafted root beer along with the chicken bacon ranch Pizza ( i think I got the smallest size they had, worrying about how much I could eat). Out came my drink! Our server notified me that they ran out of their normal straws, but gladly offered me a bendy yellow kids straw (meh, better than no straw!). I took a sip; it was way too sweet for my taste, or rather than any other generic root beer, but oh well. My pizza was out after maybe 15-20 minutes later. I took a bite of that; it tasted more salty than a pizza should be, but it was still quite edible. Our server was great, but please balance out the tastes in your food and drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corpus-christi?start=140,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

90,TJ N.,"Corpus Christi, TX",15,2,,3.0,2014-01-14,"Went here for lunchtime with my girlfriend.  We were promptly seated, and they waitress attended to us fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the interior decorations and overall ambience, but that's where my good experience ended.  I ordered the ""handcrafted root beer made in house,"" and needless to say it came out extremely flat.  I think I could've really enjoyed it because the flavor was not bad.  We ordered a couple of appetizers: the calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and two entrees: chicken fried chicken and crispy fish tacos.  It took quite a while (30 minutes or so after we ordered them) to get the appetizers out. Also, the entrees came out immediately after not giving us enough time to eat the appetizers.  The presentation was nice but the food didn't really have much flavor and was under-seasoned.  My girlfriends mashed potatoes were cold. Also another issue was after the waitress brought our food out she never returned to check on us or refill our drinks.  The next time she returned was to give us our check. It took another 15 minutes to get my change after she came for the money.  Perhaps this is just an isolated incident, but we probably won't be going back for a while. Poor first impressions are hard to overcome, but we will eventually be back to give them one more try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corpus-christi?start=80,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

They have a very very wide selection of beers to choose from.

121,Chris E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,6,,1.0,2014-04-26,"Me and my wife have been wanting to try BJ's since they opened and finally took the plunge this afternoon. First, we ordered the Lettuce Wraps appetizer and we got 4 extremely small, unassembled lettuce wraps.  Eating them was an outright mess leaving food on the table and sauce on our shirts.  Flavor was good though.  We were left with sticky fingers from the sauce and asked for wet wipes and were told they didn't have those and gave us more napkins, which didn't remove the stickiness. Flavor was okay on the appetizer so we had better hopes for the entree.  We both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken that came with white cheddar mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy.  The two pieces of chicken on each of our plates had absolutely no flavor other than grease.  There was no salt or pepper used on the chicken, or any other seasoning for that matter.  Meat and bland, unseasoned batter and nothing more.  The potatoes were obviously powdered and had a bitter taste to them, which I found very contradictory being served at a ""hand crafted"" Brewhouse.  The corn was frozen and had obviously been sitting for several hours because it was complete mush.  The cream gravy had only a slight cream taste.  We tried to use the salt and pepper shakers on the table to add some much needed flavor to the food, but both were clogged.  We asked for replacements, which were both also clogged.  We opened them up to find that it appeared they have been wiping the inside of the top of the shaker with a wet rag, thereby clogging every salt and pepper shaker they have.  The also clogged replacements were handed to me by a manager as well. I normally never post negative reviews on restaurants, but the food lacks even basic cooking principles.  The lettuce wraps were a complete mess and minuscule for the $11 they cost.  These 2 piece fried chicken plates were $12.50 each and everything on the plate lacked any flavor at all other than the bitter taste from the powdered mashed potatoes and slight cream taste from the white gravy. We won't be returning, which is sad, because I had hoped to sample their beer selection in the future.  This was an expensive lesson in bad food for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corpus-christi?start=120,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

We sat in a booth, but I didn't enjoy the guy sitting on the other side looking over the half fall to see what we're eating or listening to what we were saying. I almost said something to him, but thought better. 3. I'm only giving their food 3 stars.   Had chicken pot stickers w/ soy ginger sauce. Was ok, but I enjoy the California Pizza Kitchen's pot stickers a lot more. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Club w/ string fries, hubby ordered Bacon Cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The burger was too charbroiled for our taste and my sandwich was a bit dry. The toast was a bit too toasted for me as well. I would prefer Fuddrucker's burgers, to be honest.

Wife and I were vacationing in CC and stopped by for lunch. The waitress we had was terrible. She was polite, but it appeared she frequently forgot she was servicing our table. The only thing she did the whole time was initially say ""Hello"" and took our drink and food order. Our drinks were delivered by another staff member, our food was delivered by another staff member, and refills were provided by another staff member. To put in perspective how absent our waitress was - she stopped by and asked if we were ready for dessert before we even got our lunch. Come on now!Additionally, I ordered a hand tossed thin pepperoni pizza - i haven't even eaten a greasier pizza at Dominoes or Little Caesars!

After visiting the Corpus Christi location a few times I decided that it is not worth visiting again. I will break down my last 2 visits: I came in with my brother. We ordered a simple pizza and I got their watermelon starter salad. As it was a starter salad I figured it would come out before the pizza. Well I asked my server after 30 minuets about my salad and she promised me it will arrive before the pizza did. 5 minuets later no salad, pizza at the table. The pizza should have been a pepperoni and pesto pizza with tomato sauce. Well, no pepperoni and no sauce.  Just cheese and pesto. I told my server (who still had yet bring out my salad) and she told me she will bring out a bowl of pizza sauce and I can dip my pizza in it. That is not ok for a $21.00 pizza. Asked for a manager and he said the same thing. I told them I no longer wanted anything and I left. The whole experience took 1 hour. This last time I only came in and ordered a pazookie (I was too weak to avoid the appeal of cookies and icecream) well I sit down and order that and my rootbeer. My server saw I was only planning on spending around 9 dollars. And stopped serving me. 45 minuets pass and no pazzookie. And when it does come out the cookie is cold and there is only a pool of ice cream on top. I told the food runner (a larger Mexican lady with red hair) and she said ""oh well"" and walked away. I let a manager know and he said it didn't set at all (yeah right!) after another 20 minuets I finally got it. And still was not good.

At one point I had to look for him by asking other employees to find him for our table. When he came out with out drinks and sat them in another table my grandmother has to get up and get our drinks.

My pizza comes out on parchment paper, and the ice cream for the gluten free pizookie is taken from its own separate thing (from my understanding). I've never gotten sick, so that's a plus!

The company is known for their beer so why would they ever serve them warm. Even our food came out all wilted and dried out. None of her food was all that great. Really keep in mind I love this restaurant, their ever avocado rolls are usually some of the best I've ever had. However, when they're all dried out and will team grows not so appealing especially when they start to brown. The pasta headset for so long that was all dried out on top and all the Parmesan was sitting there almost choked to death trying to eat it it was so dried out. I just believe that their quality is really really sleepy now that they've been established in corpus a while.

Here's a clue, kid - I'm guessing the younger table tipped you a lot less than we would have for good service. You weren't bad enough to stiff, but I certainly wasn't giving you more than the minimum.  Beer selection wasn't very good. And their seasonal chocolate raspberry porter was nasty.

I'll also give two thumbs up on customer service.  We had an experience that prompted me to leave a one-star review, but I'm going to give BJ's and the location's manager a five-star rating for excellent customer service. The night we went in, someone had put a news station on that might not appeal to all customers, and we asked the server if it could be changed.  I think she wasn't sure how to handle that type of request, but told us it couldn't be changed.  I put this in my initial Yelp review, and was later contacted by a manager, Jesse, who was very apologetic.  I expressed my opinion that restaurants are usually an escape for people and that news stations with angry rhetoric is really distracting when you're trying to relax...BJ's is always a place where I can go to escape the stress of my day, so I feel that keeping the TVs tuned to sports is a best practice.  Jesse gave me an opportunity to talk about my concerns, reviewed the restaurant's policies, and addressed it with the staff, so I'm revising my review accordingly.   I think sometimes things happen, but when a company believes that customer service is important and works hard to make sure that customers are happy, they've earned a good review.  I am very appreciative that Jesse reached out, and we'll definitely be going back when we're in Corpus Christi again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-corpus-christi?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.3800000000000003,3.1600000000000006

We ordered drinks, a kids grilled chicken with fries, and the sriracha queso dip which was supposed to have the choice of either chili or pork verde. We noticed there was an option for the queso after she took our order and didn't ask us which one we wanted, when I flagged her down and asked her if we had the option she said she went ahead and just ordered it with the chili for us without asking.The kids grilled chicken came out and was cold. We ordered the Mediterranean tacos and a bowl of chili. When our food came out, the tacos looked like they were thrown together, the chicken was cold, the pita bread wasn't fresh like it normally is, the tacos were missing the feta cheese the greek yogurt, and it didn't come with the side of grains like normal.

39,G N.,"Austin, TX",13,80,217.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"Where do I start? So, I'll start off by saying that the customer service wasn't as bad as the food, but, it wasn't good enough to get any repeat business from me. One and done. Started off by waiting 12 mins to get our drink order taken, then waited another 10 mins to actually get our drinks. A cucumber mint water and a water with lemon. Nothing complicated. Our waiter comes back and leaves after dropping off our drinks. I had mentioned to him that it was our first time and asked about a few diff beers but he didn't have any answers for me. Just shrugged and said, ""I don't know."" After another 10 mins he comes back and by this time, we're contemplating on just walking out but we decide we've already waited this long, it'd be such a waste of time to leave and find another spot for dinner since we've already invested 30 mins of our time. Our appetizer comes and that's when he takes our dinner order. By the way, it's a Tuesday night, they're slow. Gf ordered a burger with add ons and I had the chicken Alfredo. To sum it up, the burger and fries had such a bad aftertaste, my gf became physically ill afterwards. My chicken Alfredo reminded me so much of Michelina's frozen dinners. You know the one, ""gourmet meals"" in the frozen cooler at HEB selling for  .98 cents. We did speak to a manager but we had first talked to her about the server taking extremely too long and severe lack of personality, however, when we no one came back to ask about the check, I put the cash with the ticket and left. Never, ever, ever, again will I ever give this place any business. What a waste of $37 and that's cheap for a dinner visit, but no way I'd ever pay to eat here again.

44,Luis T.,"Southeast Side, San Antonio, TX",45,2,,3.0,2017-09-17,"I previously visited BJs a couple of years ago for a birthday celebration. Being that we we were in town for a mini getaway and the fact that the kids were in the mood for pizza I decided to stay away from your typical affordable pies and go with a pizza that had some presentation. As soon as we were sat, we were greeted by our waiter who made no recommendations on drinks so I decided to try something on my own that I didn't end up liking. No biggie, I chalked it up to experience and asked if I could have a different drink. The waiter obliged and for the next 15-20 minutes the previous drink sat at the edge of our table without being picked up. Behind us was another table that had not been cleaned and so I proceeded place that drink I did not like, on the dirty table. 10 minutes after ordering our food, a waiter came out with two bowls of spaghetti. While we did order them, one was ordered with sauce on the side and the other with meatballs, both came out prior to the rest of our food and both dishes were just noodles and sauce. No problem, sent them back. When my waiter was asked for the whereabouts of our beer, he had a perplexed look on his face as if he had forgotten altogether. Again, no problem just a little irritated. When our food finally arrived, the deep dish pizza that had been ordered looked as if it had been sitting out for a while. The cheese while melted was no longer stretching and the toppings had arrived cold. At about this time I was just done. The experience itself discouraged me from asking for a manager because I felt that I was just maybe simply asking for too much out of a place I visited years before. Maybe I'll visit a BJs restaurant again or maybe I won't. Either way, I probably should have just played it safe and gone with the affordable pie next to our hotel.
