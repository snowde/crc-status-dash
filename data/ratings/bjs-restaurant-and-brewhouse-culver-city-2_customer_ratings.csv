Last night we went for a late dinner...not crowded at all...got a seat in a booth right away. The hostess and waitress were great-very attentive & took our drink & food order immediately. Then the wait...and wait and wait. It wasn't crowded at all but it took about 30 minutes for our small pizza to come out. And after all that, the pizza came out wrong. It wasn't how we ordered it. The waiter apologized but at that point, I was not going to wait another minute to eat after already waiting 30 minutes (it was 9pm).

Had a chopped chicken salad that was really, really good.  Also had some of my friend's avocado eggrolls, which were just OK but were made awesome with the dipping sauce.  Kind of weird that my friend couldn't get a Red Bull & vodka (they don't carry Red Bull).  Ahhh chains.

Terrible idea, I have loved the shrimp tacos at almost every place I have ever tried them but not here..

652,Lee P.,"Portland, OR",17,46,16.0,2.0,2012-03-16,"Sigh... we were in the mall in Culver City on a retail sales assessment and were starving, so we decided to get something to eat at BJ's.  I'd never heard of BJ's (we don't have any in Portland, at least that I know of), so I was neutral on the choice.  When we walked in it was big, set up with a bar area with a lot of TVs, and then spilled out into a dining area.  My first impression was... oh... this place is like a Chilis/TGI-Fridays/CheesecakeFactory/Applebees/on/and-on/and-on.   ...a chain restaurant with pre-packaged food so they can support the giant menu listing (heavy sigh).  I know this kind of food.  It all tastes 'okay', but very artificial and pre-prepared.  Knowing this, I went with the healthiest option that looked good: a flatbread veggie pizza with a salad.  It was 'meh'... not bad, but 'meh'.  My coworker had a little personal pepperoni pizza and some sort of a side.  He didn't eat all his pizza and didn't want to waste the rest, so he asked if I could eat some.  I tried it and it was like 'POP' in my mouth... a shock of ""FLAVOR"", and that was from just the crust.  Pizza crust is supposed to be a little doughy, yeasty, and earthy... not slap you in the face with zing.  I usually eat a pretty healthy and clean diet, so when I get food with artificial flavoring, especially MSG, it usually sticks out.  This time it nearly slapped me in the mouth.  Blech.  I don't want to eat that stuff.  I can't taste the real flavor and know if it's good or not... it's processed and loaded with enough flavor enhancers that it'll ""taste good"", but it doesn't register as real taste, but more so overly intense and enhanced. All in all, it got us through lunch, but I'm not a fan.  It's 'meh'... and some menu items are 'blech'.  Doubt I'll ever be back to one unless it's solely to watch a game and have a beer with friends. One thing that's always a bummer about these places is that they do have a nice environment... big booths, a cool open bar with tons of TVs to hang out and view.  Now if they could just shake the big corporate supply chain and food preparation and turn it into a local place with fresh, healthy, local, homemade food, I'd be all over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=740,2.52,2.71,2.71,2.216,2.6340000000000003
930,Olivia R.,"Newport Beach, CA",80,7,77.0,1.0,2012-03-23,"It was my first time at BJs and it was not a good experience.  1. Our waitress never brought us water 2. It took way too long to get our beer and wine 3. The salad I ordered  was the saddest looking salad I had ever seen. It was soggy with no flavor and it had some tomatoes thrown on it and a little bit of artichoke. They make the salad sound so wonderful on the menu and it was crap. I make better salads at home! For it being a 10 dollar salad I expected more then just some veggies thrown on a   plate wasn't even full. It was poor presentation and the quality was terrible. It looked like a very sad side salad. Plus it was missing some ingredients which were listed on the menu. It looked like whoever made the salad didn't care one bit. I think while they cooked my boyfriends burger they threw together my salad in 2 min and let it soak in the dressing for a good 45 minutes. I don't ever complain like this or write a review but that experience was terrible especially because I was so hungry and had waited so long for our food. It had no taste..and I sure as hell didn't want to eat soggy lettuce...so I went to subway after. Now that was good!  The waitress told me I wasn't the first to complain about the garden medley salad..so NO I'm not crazy, lol My boyfriend ordered a burger which he thought wasn't bad but not the best burger hes had. IF your going to mess up a burger there's something really wrong. The wait on everything was ridiculous. I don't think wed go there again but I did like their selection of beers. If anything wed go back for drinks. Also, after I returned my salad I wanted to glance at the menu again in case something else sounded good but then i realized I would of had to wait prob another 40 min to eat...no thank you. She never brought me a menu anyway. I had to get up and get it myself.  It was nice of the manager to come over and talk to me about it because someone in the kitchen isn't doing their job back there.

Long waits for everything, including something as simple as a napkin and water. The waitstaff has an attitude, not everyone but its more likely you'll get a shitty server than a nice one.

Well the bar area is open seating, no names on a list type of thing. The ladies sitting at the table before me offered the table as they were getting up. How did I take his seat?

Okay, so last night my friends wanted to meet up after class and BJ's was chosen because it was close to school, served alcohol and had plenty of food for us to choose from. I've been to BJ's in Dallas and had a fun experience so I was down. So I head up there and OMG, parking was a complete pain the ass! I mean, c'mon, it is in a mall structure?! Parking should not be such an issue! After driving around for forever in a day, I decided to valet instead of burning gas which was $7 (not including tip). I went into BJ's and it was pretty much like every other BJ's I've been to. Nothing special, but it was crowded and clean.  I found my friends and the waitress was super nice and took our orders quickly. Let me just say though, I was not too happy that the bartender pretended to know how to make a chocolate martini and sent me this white crap in a martini glass with a squiggle of chocolate on top that tasted like MILK. Mama wasn't happy at all. I sent that shit back with a quickness and ordered a White Russian instead and they did manage to get that one right (and it was strong). What wasn't right was paying $8 for such a basic drink at a place called BJ's.   The food was typical BJ's food. Pretty good. Everyone was ordering small bites so we could try each other's food. The avocado wraps are awesome and a great vegetarian option. Also, the Capri salad was yummy. Plus, the price point was not bad at all. The great thing I did like was our ability to have a fun, crazy conversation without being interrupted a lot nor being told to quiet down (yes, we were that table). It was awesome.

Aldo Raine - Inglorious Bastards).   I showed up early and the parking situation didn't look great.  There was a garage and my assumption was the walk would take me into some department store labyrinth so I avoided it and the only other close spots were carry out only (at least open spots).  So I ended up parking next to some ignoramus that didn't realize those white lines where the children's coloring book equivalent of what you need to stay in when parking your car.  Needless to say the spot was open for this very same reason so maybe I should have thanked the douche, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.   All this led me with a desire to wash the already sour taste in my mouth out with a cold beer, but the hostess did it with a smile and welcoming hello when I walked in.  I let her know I was waiting for a few others to arrive, but rather than sit around with twirling her hair, she readied a table for us while I waited.  That was pretty cool! The server was a doll, and knew exactly what she was doing.  Convinced all of us to order specialty drinks that we had no interest in (I went with a strawberry lemonade), and then went through the specialty items.  The southern fried chicken hit my salivating glands before my brain had to time to analyze, and it was a great choice!  The lemonade was super sweet, so I had to chase it with a water but that was my only complaint inside the doors.   I wish this restaurant was in a nicer location with better parking, but hey it's a chain.  The service and food was delish and therefore, I'll be back to probably that and other BJ's so to indulge again in no time.  Maybe these chain restaurants have something to them after all...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=740,2.4,2.7,2.7,2.544,2.58

So, I didn't mind waiting 15-20 minutes for our table. We were finally seated & our waiter took our order. I ordered a ""MEDIUM pizza"" and my friend ordered the pasta dish. He brought us our drinks and soon after returned with our food and another waitress. I looked at my pizza and said, ""this isn't a medium. I ordered a medium."" My waiter's attitude completely changed. He abruptly responded with "" YOU ORDERED THE MINI PIZZA!! I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED A MINI PIZZA AND YOU SAID YES!!! I REPEATED YOUR ORDER AND YOU SAID OK!!!""  I then explained, "" I heard you say medium and that's why I responded yes."" He haughtily responded, ""WELL THAT'S YOUR ORDER RIGHT THERE!!!!(pointing at the mini pizza on the table) AND ANYWAY THIS IS YOUR NEW WAITRESS, SHE'LL BE TAKING OVER FOR ME!!!""  I assume that it was a shift change and this jackass was ready to go home because he seemed to fly away from us at top speed.  The whole time he was ranting about my pizza the new waitress looked equally as offended as my friend and I. I never once raised my voice above normal speaking level. I just wanted what I ordered. I didn't mind waiting for that to happen. ALEX OR ALEJANDRO immediately went off on defensive rant. I felt COMPLETELY disrespected and the waitress could tell. She began to try to fix the situation and I asked to see the manager.  She went to find him and he shortly returned. I assume she explained the situation because he was completely apologetic and told me my MEDIUM pizza was being prepared as we spoke. My problem was not with the error it was how Alex handled it. He overreacted on a rational person. I don't know where the mix up actually happened.

Everything was pretty good, and the service was good when we had their attention. Getting that was a different story, but by no means horrible.  We split a pitcher of half cider half beer, which was pretty good, and saved us some money since neither of us wanted to spend a ton. We also split a desert. I think our total was about $20 each, so not bad but not great either. It was a bit loud, so talking was difficult.

Such flaws can mar an experience such as a boring wine list, errors in presentation, exorbitant prices. Some places exceed your expectations for a lesser price and give solace to an otherwise perilous experience. One such place is BJ's.

Perfect lighting, a decent menu. A cheerful and helpful waiter with a generous sense of humor. In LA waiters aren't always as self aware of their other profession. I despise when they pretend it's a novelty to be a an actor rather than just having a great time. We had the best two waiters that demanding NY'ers could imagine.

And then, if it told me it was getting deported back to Mexico, I would take it to Vegas and put a ring on it. Lock that shit down. Now, we had one of those deals where you get certain dishes for a set amount of money. The pizza was only passable. But it's deep dish and, to me, that's just not pizza. All pizza must be NY style or no style at all. The pizookie (cookie with ice cream), while not a dessert person at all, was also yummy.

She was so attentive and super informative, but best of all she suggested foods, drinks(alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and desserts. For example, my mom was undecided on her iced tea, and Francis brought her three different flavors without us knowing, Pomergrant Iced Tea, Regular Iced Tea and I can't remember the other, but I expected to get all three charged and I didn't get charged since it was a sample, plus she was being helpful :) you can really see the passion in the woman!

When they delivered a happy birthday sundae they actually put it down on the dirty dish of the recipient. To top it all off, the bathrooms were a complete mess and had no toilet paper. I could see this for a lower class of restaurant, but when you are shelling out this kind of money for a meal, you expect attentive service and clean restrooms.

Service here wasn't more then mediocre.  Ordered a medium pizza, got a small.  When I asked about it, the server initially took it back, saying sorry.  Instead of asking if I wanted to start with the small, and then have another small added in a few minutes, OR if I wanted to wait for the medium... the server came back with the small and said I could start on that while another would be prepped.  I'm sure he was intending on me getting food faster, but just ask...

632,Travis I.,"Culver City, CA",1102,473,2443.0,3.0,2013-01-02,"""Her name is Uneeda... As in: U NEED A waitress like her."" The reason for this visit: To see if they rival their neighbors across the mall, Olive Garden, when it comes to AYCE Soup and Salad; sadly, sans breadsticks... Something BJ's might consider changing to REALLY compete.  Upon our arrival, the hostess greeted and seated us, quickly. The interior was typical of what you'd expect of a modern, trendy, bistro-like eatery such as BJ's. The bar area was quite impressive, and the selection of beers from the tap didn't disappoint (after all, they ARE a brewhouse).  Our waitress, Uneeda, greeted us with a warm hello and a friendly smile. I'm telling you, she looks a bit like a mighty fine, younger Michelle Obama. At any rate, her demeanor was exactly what I'd want if I ran a restaurant like BJ's. She immediately noticed my camera and paper pad and took extra time to indulge the foodie in me. Every single plate or bowl she brought out to us was brought with a smile and an explanation of what was in the dish. Either someone in the kitchen was making our plates super pretty or BJ's has their plating on LOCK DOWN... I was impressed at the little extra plating techniques that helped elevate the dish from a boring salad to a pretty plate. SOUP. - Tortilla: Not too bad. I bit thick for my liking, but not too bad. A tableside pour made it seem extra cool... a nice touch, indeed. More tortilla strips would be good; even if they are cooked in the broth. I felt the flavor of tortilla was a bit muddled by all the strong chili and cumin flavor. ((It DID have roasted corn, which I quite fancy))  - Minestrone: Good. Lotsa veggies, hearty broth, but the rotini noodles were lost on me. I'm a die-hard macaroni fan (rigatoni, penne, etc), when it comes to minestrone. Nonetheless, it was the only soup of which I had two cups.  - Broccoli Cheddar: HEAVY. Very thick and cheesy. If they thin it out just slightly and put about twice as much broccoli in it, I'll dive in and take a swim. A good attempt, but needs refining, in my opinion. (Just an opinion) - Clam Chowder: This was good, but needed to be served hotter. Texture was good, taste was good, but temperature was lacking. And in a seafood soup, you really want that soup hotter than hell. - Chili con Carne: Creamy Chili?!... No thanks. This was the only true fail. The chili was über thick, and had a disproportionate dollop of sour cream on it, which turned the chili into a ""dip-like cream of chili."" This did NOT bode well for me. SALAD. - Cesar Salad. The salad was good, but the dressing lacked punch... Maybe it was underdressed. Not the best place to start. Should've started with a simple garden salad. - Wedge. If you don't like wedge salads, you can kiss my grits, nootch. Typical preparation with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, tomato, and red onion... Quite delicious. If I were obese, I'd eat a gang of these. - Watermelon & Feta. I can't tell you how cool it is that BJ's offers this salad. Served on a rectangular plate, this fresh and cool salad refreshes you, even on the warmest summer day. A perfect pairing and a definite thumbs up, in my book. (Bring along some candied walnuts or pecans for extra ""pow"" factor) - Caprese. Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil and Balsamic with some shredded Parmesan. Cool plating, good taste. Not the greatest caprese I've ever had, but just the simple squeeze bottle action on the dressing makes a HUGE difference in terms of presentation. Good enough for AYCE, by all means.  PIZOOKIE, ON THE HOUSE. - Uneeda told us that we weren't leaving without trying their signature dessert: the pizookie. It's a piping-hot, pan-cooked chocolate chip cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. I'm not a fan of sweets, but this was absolutely delightful. Hot and cold temperatures having a party in my mouth?... Hell yeah. OVERALL... The food is good. If it weren't for Uneeda's exemplary service, I'd probably have given it two-stars, because chili is REALLY hard to screw up, in my opinion. Furthermore, a less-than-stellar Cesar salad coming from a kitchen that manages to present a delicious Watermelon & Feta salad is gonna get dinged. Lastly, BJ's should consider adding bread of some kind to further sweeten this Soup & Salad lunch special. It would certainly serve a couple purposes: It would fill up customers more rapidly and cost-effectively and it would also increase the competition between them and Olive Garden.  None of the soups or salads I had truly ""wowed"" me (MAYBE with the exception of the Watermelon & Feta salad, which is just shocking to see as an AYCE menu option), but there were a couple that fell short of the mark. Nonetheless, this experience was really made enjoyable by Uneeda. Her shining smile and constant efforts to increase our dining pleasure were the reasons we left with the desire to return. So, Uneeda, I take my hat off AND salute you, for you are the true embodiment of awesome service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=220,3.08,2.68,2.696,2.508,2.8400000000000003

I didn't have time to check at the restaurant though, and didn't want to ruin the burger by cutting it in half then letting it sit 10 mins in the car while I get home. It was not well done at all in the center, though on the outside it was dry and burnt looking/tasting.  Bacon was great though, I replaced my patty with my fries and ate it without the beef...

All the football games were on all the flat panel tv screens at very corner of restaurant. Loved the bar set up...looked very elegant.

733,Jackie G.,"Hawthorne, CA",16,6,,3.0,2013-01-13,"So my boyfriend and I decided to go to BJ's in Torrance, but the wait time was 1hr-1hr and 30 minutes. So, my boyfriend decided to go to the one in Culver City, which we can phone ahead and make reservations. When we got there the host gave me one of those vibrating devices and told me it would be 25-30 minutes. Okay we decided to go to the mall to buy something. We went back downstairs and noticed that these two girls who just got there were seated right away. I went up to ask the host if they had called us and said yes we called you a long time ago. Hmmm weird? It didn't vibrate. She said ""Oh it doesn't vibrate."" Okay? why would you give it to me to begin with??? It would of been nice if someone would of informed us we had to stay locked inside with the huge crowd of people! Whatever, we got seated right away and took nearly 20 minutes for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered wings, which were awesome! That night I went safe and ordered fettucini alfredo, and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, easy celery and onion. We got our food and my pasta tasted like plain pasta yuck! Then my boyfriends pizza had so much tomato sauce,and the sauce was super sweet while the buffalo sauce was really spicy. It felt like we were eating bread with a spicy and sweet sauce, not so delicious! When the waitress asked us how were doing we asked for ranch, thinking it would minimize that sweet flavor. It took nearly 20 minutes to bring it out hmmm i hope they were making it from scratch! Finally we ordered a mini pazzoki best part of the night! When we got our pazzoki the waitress didn't leave the bill, we already knew it would be another waiting game with her! Finally after 10 minutes she brought us our bill, and then waited another 20 to come back with our receipt, since we paid with a card.  Overall the Torrance location is way better! They always get the order right they're fast  their pasta doesn't taste plain and best part their little vibrating thing works anywhere in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=700,3.0,2.74,2.736,2.2199999999999998,2.8440000000000003

Good Staff, good food, good service.  Running on the theory that all chain restaurants all pretty much the same I went to this one.  Well I was wrong.  Slow service, although the bar wasn't that busy.  I ordered a cup of clam chowder and a mini pizza.  I got the pizza first. Nice.  The chowder showed up afterwards.  The bar staff was nice enough to take my pizza away to stay warm. It came back 60 seconds later reheated to the point it was goo.  So I tried the chowder, bland with big huge chunks of a chewy tasteless substance I assumed was clams.  couldn't finish that.  The pizza believe it or not (since they heated twice) was undercooked. No one asked nor seemed to care that I was not enjoying my food.  So I ate what I could stomach and waited for my bill. And waited. And waited. And waited.... Lovely.

519,Ebony B.,"San Diego, CA",116,91,77.0,3.0,2013-01-21,"I have been a long-time fan of BJ's, ever since my friend introduced me to the Great White. It had been a couple of years since I had been to BJ's, so I gladly returned considering I was way overdue.   I split a Great White deep dish pizza with my friend. Medium is more than enough for two hungry chicks; large would have been good to take home leftovers.  I don't know if it's because BJ's has changed it's recipe, or if it's that all BJ's are not created equal, but the pizza was a tad bit below my expectations for BJ's.  Mainly the crust... it was kinda dry and not as greasy. I guess that's a good thing, but we're talking BJ's, not a frozen diet dinner.  Also, the pizza itself was kind of dry-ish.  It wasn't sink-your-teeth-into-it pleasurable, like I normally feel when I eat their pies.   The thing that saves this BJ's location from getting a lower score is the fact that their other menu items taste the way they should when compared to other BJ's. They have such a wide menu and almost anything you order is guaranteed to be delicious. Everyone talks about their Pazookie, which, if not for that, I wouldn't be trying to make them at home now... but their Baked Beignet is extremely good! With it's whip cream and french vanilla ice cream sitting atop a warm, fluffy, lightly crisp beignet, drizzled with strawberries and strawberry syrup... you cannot go wrong! (unless they prepare this differently, too). I would return to this BJ's again, however, my expectations would be lowered and I would probably get the other items (like a deluxe salad or loaded baked potato) instead of the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=480,3.12,2.76,2.74,2.0920000000000005,2.9040000000000004

Main entrance is annoying and inefficient as it's a turnstile, revolving door. Restaurant is quite large and open with high ceilings, so it's a lot nicer than most BJ's I've been to. Being a party of five, we were seated at a booth. Waitress quickly got our drink orders and brought them. She was short, which could've been mistaken for as rudeness, but she was efficient and got the job done. We ordered two appetizers, one large pizza, and a dessert to share. Spinach & Artichoke Dip Nothing to write home about, nor complain. Very basic. Comparable to the one at California Pizza Chicken. Chicken Lettuce Wraps Didn't try this, so I don't have an opinion. My coworkers all loved it. Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza  We asked for bacon on the side, but it was pretty good without it. The photos on their menu make the pizzas look super thick and fluffy... which was not how the pizza looked in real life. It was still a thicker crust than how I normally like it though, as I prefer NY style thin crust. I wouldn't mind ordering this again. Chocolate Chip Pizookie Everyone's so obsessed with pizookies, and while I admit they're good, they're not as divine as everyone makes them out to be. What's so special about a warm cookie with ice cream? I don't get it. Since it was also one of my co-worker's birthday, our waitress was kind enough to give her a complimentary mini pizookie. I really like their cookie and ice cream ratio as most restaurants usually skimp out on the latter. Like with all chain restaurants, you really can't expect much. Both service and food were mediocre.

Strike two: Lady comes back and talks to hostess (straight gossip) for another 5 minutes while the four of us stand there on our lunch hour.  Strike three: Food was not cooked as well as other locations. We sat for 15 minutes trying to flag down our waiter for our bill. We received refills after we had already paid (none throughout the hour we were there.) Not to mention the hostess girls need to dress more professional. Bras hanging out while the rest of the staff is professional. I could have gone to a fast food place if I wanted that view.

Umm we tried to and you told us we couldn't do that. 2.

We walked up to the hostess stand, and there were 3 employees talking to each other and another customer for a long time. The party in front of us stood there awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged.  Once the hostess finally greeted us and took our names, we all waited about 10 minutes, and then they tried to seat us before the party in front of us. They mixed up both of our parties' names and there was confusion all around.  Did I detect a sharp note in the hostess's voice directed toward us after I corrected her pronunciation of my name? I don't think I imagined that. We were finally seated and our waiter was Sayeed (sp?). My BF ordered the Bold and Amber taster set of beers and the bacon cheeseburger with a garden salad. I ordered the black cherry soda and the build-your-own hand-tossed pizza with pepperoni, meatballs, mushrooms, and roasted garlic, with a Caesar salad. After I ordered my pizza, the waiter abruptly walked away from the table; I had to call after him that I wanted to include a salad too. Also, he didn't ask my boyfriend what kind of French fries he wanted with his burger. The waiter ended up bringing him the Pale and Hoppy taster set, which was not what he had ordered. Also, I think BJ's has changed the recipe for the black cherry soda -- it used to be served in a chilled mug and the flavors of cherry and vanilla really popped in your mouth; last night it was served in a regular class and tasted watery and flat.  My boyfriend's burger came with shoestring French fries instead of wedge, and my pizza crust was overly toasted around the edges but soggy in the middle.   Since we were seated so close to the hostess stand, I could see the employees gossiping there (or at least it looked like that's what they were doing). I'm not against having fun at work, but at one point, It appeared that they were talking trash about another waitress and flirting with a male employee.  The mediocre food, unprofessional staff, and order mix-ups all added up to make it a disappointing Sunday dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=480,1.88,2.66,2.676,2.2800000000000002,2.348

823,D S.,"Berkeley, CA",0,17,,2.0,2013-06-11,"I've been to this BJ's a few times and really enjoyed their food.  Their fettucine alfredo is one of the best I've ever tasted.  The problem is about half the time I go there, there's an issue with the staff.   When I went for lunch I didn't seem to have a problem, but for whatever reason the rude waiters and hostesses seem to come out at night. One particular time I went to BJ's with a large group.  When the bill came we all divided it up and paid with either cash or credit.  A few minutes later the waitress returned with our money and a new bill saying this was a little awkward but we haven't given her enough of a tip.  For groups of eight of more they have a specified tip.  We were short less than a dollar.  The thing is I looked at the new bill and it was completely different from the old one.  The old bill had been a general bill, but the new one was for groups.  This one actually had a specified tip on it for groups of eight or more, and the initial one did not.  It wasn't a big deal adding in the extra change, but several of us paid with credit cards and had written the amounts on the back of the old bill.  When we explained this to the waitress and asked for the old bill back, she claimed to have lost it.  As a result we had to waste more time figuring out how much everyone was paying again.  It was pretty obvious by the end of the ordeal that the waitress had initially given us the general bill hoping we would give her a larger tip than the one mandated by the restaurant for groups of eight or more, and then traded it out for a new bill when the plan backfired.  If she had simply made a mistake she could have just told us there was a mix-up, but the shady behavior made it clear that was not the case.  Honesty is an important quality I expect from those I give money to, and I did not get it here. In short, the food is good, check out the fettucine alfredo, and if you want to go to this location try to go during the day.  If you have a desire to go to BJ's at night, I'd suggest trying another location.  Also there's not much parking that's very close to the restaurant and you will probably have to park somewhat far and have to walk some.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=880,1.92,2.62,2.644,2.408,2.34

701,K B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,13,,2.0,2013-06-16,"Like others that have reviewed this restaurant, I have been to other BJ's and I have always had a great experience. But this was not a good meal experience. To be fair, our waitress was very good. She was friendly, considerate enough to check up on us through our meal, and even brought us Father's Day glasses when I didn't know they were giving them out. Where things fell apart was with the hostess, other wait staff and food. First, I walked up to the hostess stand and the hostess and some gentleman were doing something on the computer. Rather than acknowledge me, or let me know they would be right with me, they ignored me and kept doing what they were doing. After several minutes of standing there, they finally helped me. Second, the wait staff didn't seem to know where an order needed to go. One staff member brought another table's order to our table. A waiter brought one of our lunches to a different table. I guess they don't know table numbers or something. And why they didn't bring all our items at the same time, I don't know. Instead, we had three different waiter/waitresses bring us our food at different times. Third, two staff members moved an empty table that was located behind me to another part of the restaurant. However, when they pulled out the chairs to get access to the table, they left the chairs where they were--which was right behind me. I mean directly behind me; I couldn't scoot my chair back to get out. I had to ask my waitress to move the chairs when she came to check on us. Lastly, the quality of the food was below what I am used to at a BJ's. We ordered the calamari appetizer and the portion was small  (not worth the $10 they charge even if it was good -- which it wasn't). I ordered a roast beef sandwich and my fries were soggy because the au jous sauce was all over my plate. One daughter had the lettuce wraps and the lettuce they used just fell apart making it impossible to eat; another daughter ordered the jalapeño burger which was burnt on the edges and only had three jalapeños on it; and then my third daughter ordered fettuccine alfredo which was pure butter. The alfredo sauce was more butter than anything else and the garlic bread was dripping with butter. Totally gross. We will definitely never return here and recommend you never go there either.

I usually get the Hawaiian mahi mahi and the other person in the party gets traditional buffalo wings and we order a half and half pazookie. The hostesses are always amazing as they were last night and they remember our faces and know how much we frequent this restaurant and usually sit in a booth in the bar. Last night we decided to go there after a pretty long hiatus and we say ourselves in a booth after a great enjoyable welcoming conversation with the hostesses around 8:45pm. We sat there in the both for about 7 minutes until our server came over. We even tried to flag down someone who we saw just standing leaning back against the wall by the stairs that lead up to the restrooms, he looked at us then looked away. Finally our server Travis came over. He brought us menus and said he'll be right back. We were like ok...after about 4-5 minutes he returned with waters and asked did we want anything else to drink or an appetizer and we said no thank u we're ready to order. So we ordered the traditional wings and Hawaiian mahi mahi. He left to quickly before I could ask for one more thing. Now we hadn't seen him even walk by to check on us until our food came when I wanted to ask him for limes for our waters. Our food was delicious as always which was one of the highlights of the evening. Then we ordered a pazookie at 9:06pm and at 9:11 Travis came by saying it'll be out in just a few minutes and we were like ok great thank u. 9:26 rolls around and he finally brings it over to us and we were close to canceling it because of how long it took. He said that the kitchen burned the first one which is what took so long...didn't really believe that and would've expected something a little more than a half-a**ed apology. The manager could have at least brought it out since Travis was very slow and we barely saw him anyways. When he brought the pazookie we immediately asked for the bill because if we didn't we knew it would be another 20 minutes before we saw him again. The crazy/funny/ironic part is that once I put the cash down for the bill he came immediately right back. That was the quickest we had seen him return and it was when it involved money. Tsk tsk tsk Tavis!! That's not a good way to receive a substantial gratuity. As we left the hostess continued be a highlight of our dining experience.

For dessert, I was stuck between the new summer berry/candied peach cobbler and a similar-sounding blend of deep-dish berries, both with vanilla bean ice cream on top. I decided to go with the former, but our waiter ended up confusing the two (understandably..) and gave me the wrong dessert. It wasn't that big a deal since the two are similar.

136,Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1173,8494.0,3.0,2013-07-23,"Went here on a Friday night to meet some friends visiting from out of the country & one that is an airline pilot that was arriving at LAX that night. Hence the reason for meeting in the Westside. I agree with other Yelpers in that this place is ""parking challenged"". I drove by and didnt see any spaces near the front of the restaurant available & it didn't look like they would open up anytime soon. There is valet right at the Fox Hills mall entrance closest to BJ's. I drove around back near the pizzeria & other eateries and fortunately found a space at the very corner. We started off at the bar with our fluctuating group headcount... for some drinks & some appetizers (calamari). Calamari was good & plentiful for an appetizer portion but what was with the ranch dipping sauce beside the requisite marinara?? Not necessary IMO. We closed the bar tab & finally got a table after what seemed like over an hour long wait. We arrived at 9pm. We probably were seated around 1045pm? In all fairness, we did not request a table or have the needed headcount til about 930-940, but still... we waited a while. It was friday night, i know. It was busy but not wall to wall packed by any means. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. I opted for the wedge cut fries... The food arrived in a decent amount of time. It was good. The bread wwas delish. It had a bit of a crispness on the outside & was soft on the inside. Just perfect... I like the garlic aioli that was spread on the bread. The burger patty itself was good, a little dry but I ordered it well so that's what I get. The cheddar cheese was good. I needed ketchup for my fries & the waiter was quick to get that. I asked for a refill on water & that took a long time. I was really thirsty by the time I had to remind him about it... That was a bummer. Decent food. Inconsistent service but a good place to have drinks & a meal with friends. Good luck finding parking.

Unfortunately since this place opened a couple of years ago I have to say that the service has always been lacking. From the excessive waiting time for the food to arrive to the staff not being knowledgeable about the menu.  I was here recently and our order was messed up, and my friend ended up waiting an extra 45 minutes for her food to arrive. By then the rest of us had finished our meals. The waiter was very nice and apologetic, but then we received our bill and the wrong item was still on the bill, and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes to gt the correct bill, and get our change to leave. He did not een comp us anything, not that we were expecting it, but it would have been nice.  For a place that it always busy, I would just think that they would have more staff helping wait tables, and more staff in general to help out. I will not be returning for a long time.  On a side note, although our waiter was very nice, the guy who brought out our food was not nice at all. He made faces when we asked for extra condiments, and practically threw the plates on the table.

Bringing up the service at the end of the meal with the manager, he asked if there was anything he could do and said that he could pay for HALF of our pizookie.  This was kind of a slap in the face, as he could not even offer to cover the whole thing after all that had happened. Service: 1 star Overall: 2 stars, won't be coming back, if it wasn't for the service I'd probably come back here again bc the food wasn't that bad.  My friends got the pizza, I had the fish tacos, 3-3.5 stars for the food alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=440,2.84,2.62,2.652,1.8960000000000001,2.708

592,Nicole C.,"Berkeley, CA",0,4,,1.0,2013-08-19,"SAD PANDA. I don't EVER have to write a bad review so this was a momentous occasion. We love BJ's in Arizona, but this location was absolutely horrible. We were seated much later than we were told we were going to be- no biggie, we didn't care.   Our waiter, Alejandro, Ignored us most of the time while talking to his friends at the table across the way.  Thanks to this- our drinks took 20 minutes, our appetizers were never ordered, and when our food arrived a half an hour later (without any of our appetizers ever coming)  they were mediocre and one dish even splattered all over the plate and missing items.   After nicely asking for some couscous they returned 10 minutes later with a dish of cold salmon and more splattered sauce everywhere. The manager, a lady came over three times offereing us a pizzokie and claiming the waiter never told her he forgot our appetizers, or that our food arrived cold and messy. Also, this whole time instead of Alejandro being more attanetive he ignored us. We asked for the check and instead he ignored us for 20 minutes more. When the manager stopped by again she ""apparently"" had no idea what was going on. We said we didn't ask for her and that we wanted to leave and pay. I eneded up never even eating becauase my dish was messed up so many times. After turning down their offer for free dessert (who wants that when we can't even get a meal right!?) they were offended we didn;t want dessert and got in our face asking us why didn't want to try ordering more food. The manager even said ""isnt that what you come to a restaurant for""?! really lady? yea I do, that's why I needed to get the hell out of there and eat some real food at a place with decent service.  I won;t even repeat everything this dumb manager said or this ridiculous waiter did.

The only thing I thought was worth getting was the Avocado Egg Rolls. Then one fateful day I came across the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza(or Great White sometimes) with my friend. It is the perfect combination of a meal. We split the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which comes with mashedpotatoes and broccoli (they split it to two plates for you), and then share a small pizza so three slices each. If were still hungry we also add a pizookie at the end. Most of the time we eat all this and take home one slice to-go. These two dishes have been the most acceptable to me at BJs and it is the only thing I get now when it is absolutely necessary to resort to this restaurant.

569,C.M. V.,"Long Beach, CA",61,25,1.0,1.0,2013-11-11,"It seems as though we'd be echoing all of the comments that mention slow service and the inability of management to compensate for the wait staff. We went for a private party reserved for the patio area. The expectation (seeing as we were there for a reserved patio party) would be that there would be more than enough wait staff assigned to our large party. This was not the case, and the rest of our visit to BJ's went downhill from there. * Poor customer service overall.  * No one greeted us or offered water to our table. Our table was situated toward a corner of the patio, but was closest to the frequently used exit/entrance of the wait staff. Waitress consistently seemed to make rounds to all other tables except the corner tables.  * Arrived at 7:30pm; wasn't asked about what we would like to order until 8:45pm. When we did ask for water (since it was never offered to us), they still NEVER brought it out.  * Our order of appetizers took 40 minutes to arrive to our table. Our entrees never arrived, and it was 9:45pm when we decided to leave. * When we approached the front desk to settle our bill for the appetizers that we did receive/eat, we also made a complaint about the poor customer service as well as the poor timing of food served. This is where the management showed their inadequacy and lack of personable customer service. The manager, Mike, said, ""When I went in there, I asked everybody how they were doing, and everyone said they were doing great. I wasn't aware that you were not."" A blanket call out to a big party in the patio to ask, ""How's everyone doing?"" is not customer service. Between the two of us, we have over 25 years of customer service experience, and a blanket statement never does and never will ""cover"" all the needs of your customers/clients. Mike apologized about not knowing that our needs were not met and that our experience with BJs at that location was poor. His apology was insincere, forced, and rehearsed. He told us that he would talk to the person who was waiting on us. One of the ladies who waited on us (because our original waitress never followed through) walked over with a plastic to-go bag in her hand. It was our entree that never made it to us. Her tone matched Mike's tone. We're assuming she was a manager or an assistant manager since she was not in a BJs server uniform. Her name is Mecca Tanksly (sp). She said the same thing as Mike stating that she ""asked everyone how they were doing, and everyone said that everything was great!"" Again, we explained to her we shouldn't have to explain to her that despite our table being in the corner of the patio, we should not have been overlooked. She interrupted our complaint with lots of acknowledgement filler phrases that were so insincere and completely translated to why their customer service was the way it was. She apologized with this same tone. When we tried to pay for our appetizer, she said she would take care of it. She offered to give us our entree, but we declined as this location definitely left a ""bad taste"" in our mouths. The next day when we spoke to the other guests who were at our table, they said it was a hassle getting our appetizer and entree removed from the table bill because of course BJ's did not want to create separate bills for separate guests. *We're not asking for anyone to wait on us hand and foot. A simple greet and inventory of our needs when we first arrived would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Bringing water without us having to ask at a restaurant of this ""caliber"" would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Physically walking over to our table and asking the guests at our table (not just shouting into a crowded party of guests) how we were doing and if we needed anything would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Getting our order taken within, say, 10-15 minutes of us arriving and being seated would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Receiving our full order within our two and a half hour visit would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. This BJ's location lacks the depth of management and wait staff and basic customer service skills to earn another visit or a recommendation from patrons. By the way, we told the second manager that we were avid Yelpers, and we always want to be able to make recommendations for the businesses we patronize. She said, ""Oh, I don't even get on Yelp! I don't pay attention to that stuff."" Again, they're missing the mark if they are clearly not caring about taking the time to read reviews and feedback about their establishment and their service. Maybe, they should rethink checking Yelp! and listening and receiving their patron's feedback to continually look for more ways to improve their service and their company's reputation. BJ's corporate office would certainly be disappointed among other things to hear that their own employees don't take time to research ways to improve and deliver quality to patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=580,2.2,2.5,2.624,2.2760000000000002,2.38

Why I go in the first place:  Great deep dish pizza, excellent beer selection, lively atmosphere.   What ruined the experience:  Our server was non-existent.  The food and drink took too long to come out.  When it did, the pizza wasn't hot, the pan was merely warm to the touch.  She brought us a container for the leftover pizza rather than a pizza box, and didn't offer a bag to carry it out in.  Our plates took too long to be cleared.  I also noticed this at the table next to us where they stacked their dishes in the middle while having dessert.  In the end, I had to find the manager to ask for the check because we couldn't find our server (she apparently left without letting us know another server had taken over the station). The manager pitched in to help out - she took our drink order after we'd been seated and not acknowledged, served the meals, and brought the check - but this was after we'd already waited too long.

(5 stars for being open late). The rest of this review is for their take out service:  I wanted the ability to just pick up my order, and was kinda fascinated with the idea that they will take your food out to your car when you arrive. -- that didn't happen. Called at 9:30 pm for a take out order. Someone answered, but had to ""transfer me to the take out counter"", waited for 5 minutes, no answer. Then finally another gentleman picked up and said ""can you hold?"" And then they hung up after I waited on the line for another 10 minutes. The 2nd time I called, I had already arrived in the parking lot by then, they put me on hold for 12 minutes, then I hung up. Oh my goodness. 1 star for take out phone service as I was never able to talk to anyone to take my order. Since I was already in the parking lot, and I was determined to get a cheese burger, and no one else was open that late, I got out of my car and walked in to the restaurant. The place was semi full for a Friday night, but what appalled me the most was they had 3 hosts standing behind the host bar, and 1 person at the take out counter. And many waiters and waitresses in and around the restaurant.  I stood at the takeout counter for them to take my order. Their phone was ringing and they did not bother to pick up. A couple and a college student were standing by waiting for their order.  We all waited about 35 min to get our orders, because the staff did not communicate to us that out order was ready (I'm guessing it was ready after 10-15 min), even though they took our names. 1 star for lack of communication to patrons. Peeved.

On this occasion, service from our waitress wasn't the best as we had to wait close to an hour to get served. (Tick, tock.....) Now I'll slide and recognize because it was Sunday, business might be busier than usual, but almost an hour wait? Not cool. When it came time for our orders, our waitress who apparently felt stressed the whole time she approached our table, almost missed a order request from one member of our party and when it came time for our food to be served, another member was given a different meal than what they had selected. So on the service side, it could have been better. A whole lot better. Of course, that's not to take away the quality food BJ serves. It was lunchtime so I had a nice sampling of one of their sandwiches. Their burgers are pretty awesome too, if your stomach can hold out after a long wait. They have an outstanding menu and even though our visit wasn't so great, the meals we ate definitely deserve an A+ each and every time. What I also like about this particular location is that while it's close to the mall, parking wasn't that bad and once you get inside, they have huge screens all around. Just enough to have an excuse for a night out with the guys.

After a few minutes, the waiter strolled over, no smile, no introduction, no basic ""Good evening, how are you tonight"" banter... just down to the basic, ""What can I get you guys?"" He looked like he was having a bad day and if anyone was to ask for too much, he was gonna tell them where to go. Bearing that in mind, we ordered. I got a water to start and my hubby got a black and coke. Please tell me why it took 10 minutes for me to get my water? It came after my husband got his black and coke. Last I checked, they don't actually have to assemble the water like an alcoholic beverage.... Now comes the food. We ordered their deep dish pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni. We requested no tomatoes on the cheese portion. It came with tomatoes. We scraped them off. The pizza itself was not crunchy and not very flavorful either. It was a bit soggy on the crust and tasted a bit old. It was also medium warm when we received It, not piping hot like it had just come out of the oven.  We had a little better service when we moved to a bigger table, but we had already eaten by then. If you don't want to be at work, then don't come in cause the attitude really is not necessary.

My sister and a friend came with me and we came in on a Sunday night hungry and ready to have a good time. However that's the total opposite of what we got. I live in torrance and go to BJs over there and never have a problem. Yet this was just sad so we got seated instantly and was sitting at the table for about 20 minutes until we were asked for a drink then we ordered at the same time because it took so long! When the food came 20 minutes later! My sister asked for no tomatoes, no pickles and what do you know? they came with it! My friend ordered a well done burger and it was medium rare!so she sent it back and we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and get pizookies but they were burnt and and half done too! Even funnier thing is these came before my friends burger did! So we asked for a manager and the waiter got smart so we asked OUR waiter and the General manager came 10 minutes later! So he listened to my sister complain and she said she wouldn't pay for anything because we barely ate and the service was sad. He left to figure out a solution and he decided to cover the bill. Meanwhile when my sister complained he mentioned that he apologized for the experience and that the night was busy and they wouldn't have so many customers if everyone's experience was as bad as ours but based off these reviews doesn't look any different from ours!

Okay, another 5 minutes later I was still waiting. Then another employee tells me to go the bar to ask for my order. (I'm thinking..isn't that your job!. Okay) So I go and ask for my order at the bar and the gentlemen there doesn't know anything about a ""to go order"" and tries to help me with a better attitude. Seriously, it shouldn't take almost 20 minutes to pick up a to go order!!!. The second time I ordered, my BF went to pick it up and was told to wait for the order. His exactly text to me was ""HORRIBLE SERVICE"".

I called and asked the restaurant and the first person I talked to said there wasn't one and to park either in a takeout spot or in a close parking space, then she put me on hold. It was super busy because it was a Sunday night but I eventually found  a close parking space five minutes later. I was still on hold. Finally someone came back to the phone (a different person) and asked where I was parked. I said I was in a 2 hour parking spot right outside the restaurant. Her response was, ""all the way down there?"" I told her I was literally right outside the restaurant and this is where the first woman told me to go. She told me to move to the mall valet and put my blinkers on, and that my food wasn't ready yet. So now it's ten minutes after my food was supposed to be done. I moved and sat there for another five minutes and she came out. When I got home I noticed that my ice cream was in a non insulated container and right on top of my hot food. It also was vanilla when I asked for chocolate (I double checked my receipt). The cookie was burnt and in a ripped foil covering. They didn't open the vents on the container that my entree was in so the fries were soggy. On top of that, they tasted weird like they were freezer burned. The chicken strips were mostly breading and no actual chicken.

I wasn't being a jerk about it. I don't/didn't drink. I didn't raise my voice, didn't even leave my seat. My only crime was having the audacity to argue with this woman on a power trip.

You get the picture.  We told the server who said he was going to get someone. Five minutes, ten minutes....no one came. My mom, soaking wet,  had to go to the host, who in turn found someone to clean up the mess.  Then my mom ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken with the Brussels sprouts and I ordered the Mahi Mahi with Pineapple Fried Rice. It wasn't even close to the first time experience.  Maybe a different chef.  The icing on the cake, my pineapple fried rice turned out to be rice pilaf.  We shared this with the manager, who proceeded to look at my plate and said, ""It looks like brown rice to me. They just forgot the pineapple.""  I know what brown rice taste like and it wasn't brown rice.  He did bring me a side of the brown rice and a side of the pineapple....whatever.  At that point, I was done.  He then had a discussion with my mom on how she was probably mistaken the last time she was there because that is how they always serve her dish.  Really????  My mom was so excited to go back there and to share her first experience with my grandmother, who was with us. Very disappointing.  The reason I'm giving them 2 stars....our new server, that took over for the one that let my mom sit in water, was amazing.  I don't remember his name.  He's a law student at UCLA and I believe he is from Texas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=740,2.36,2.47,2.548,2.12,2.426

The most recent was a few days ago, Sunday evening. They have new holiday menus which we all decided to order from. My daughter ordered the ""New Deep Dish Lasagna. If you look at the photos I've posted, you will see that they skimped on her ""ravioli"". It was so dry (lacked fresh marinara sauce) probably due to sitting under a heat lamp. It tasted much better after we asked for some extra sauce. Mom ordered the House Top Sirloin w/Lemon Garlic Shrimp. The shrimp was good but a little on the salty side. Although the steak was ordered medium, it was received well done, with the burnt side facing down. (I guess they thought if they put the burnt side down no one would notice.) Our waitress agreed it was overcooked, took mom's plate to show the cook & then brought her plate back.  It took a while for mom to get the ""correctly"" grilled steak (cooked medium RARE this time) but at least she was able to eat her Cheddar mashed potatoes & broccoli while waiting. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi & Parmesan crusted scallops with steamed green beans & roasted brussels sprouts. The mahi mahi was spicy dry without a trace of lemon Chardonnay butter sauce. Maybe next time I'll try the grilled mahi mahi. The beans were excellent! Fresh & steamed to perfection. The brussels sprouts were very disappointing in comparison to the beans.

Hostess says she'll get a table as soon as possible but we wait another 15 min while other people are called and seated.

She seats us and apologizes for the wait but never took any responsibility, she blamed it on it being busy. We didn't acknowledge the apology nor did we look at her. She offered to get us started on drinks but after the service, we weren't in the mood so we declined.

141,Derek K.,"Yokohama, Japan",365,503,1335.0,1.0,2015-04-15,"Rating: 20/100 pts BJ's is a chain restaurant/brewery that appears in a lot of malls and shopping areas, and thanks to a recent company dinner, I can say I've been to several locations enough times to form my opinion on them. Since I don't drink alcohol, this review is based solely on their food, which, on the whole, I find to be quite deplorable. Their signature ""deep"" dish pizza is a pretty sad affair. Though you may be tempted to order it, don't expect anything fancy. The cheese is rubbery, tomato sauce is absent, and it has a shocking reliance on low quality, high sodium toppings. It mostly ""deflates"" soon after being served, becoming more of a ""kinda thick"" dish pizza. This $20+ dud tastes like freezer food. Actually, I'm pretty sure it is. The spare ribs are almost tasteless, and the NY steak is overly tough. The best dish I've had has been their Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Though it is by no means phenomenal, coming in a light, lemony butter sauce, this was the only dish of the bunch I tried that I could actually chew without my internal ""dangerous substance"" sensors going off. For dessert, their menu touts their ""pizookies"". Although the concept of combining a pizza and a cookie sounds amazing in theory, in practice, it's as disappointing as it is a clumsy portmanteau. They're overly greasy, diabete-causingly sweet, and furthermore, not much resembling pizza. It's just an oversized cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream scooped on top. Pizookie? More like ""fiascookie"". (See, I can make bad portmanteaus too.) But I hate to be completely negative, so in fairness, here's their good points. The servers are pretty awesome, typically being cheerful and attentive. Too bad service tends to be sllllooooow as hell. It's not really the server's fault, though; try as they might, this place is just too huge to swiftly make the rounds. Most of the food is utterly diet-destructive, but the menus clearly state the caloric {mega}load of each item, allowing you to be strategic with how to deal your damage. Also, they have an ""enLightened"" section of the menu, which has some semi-healthy items to choose from. They're open late, and apparently have a lot of beer choices, if you're into that sort of thing. I was willing to give them 2 stars, but took one more off considering their prices. Overall, you're paying for way overpriced freezer food. But hey, if you're here for their bar, you may not even notice. I don't know what ""BJs"" stands for, and I'm fine with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=100,2.52,2.5,2.496,1.988,2.508

182,A P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,14.0,1.0,2015-05-24,"Not, nope, never, noooooooo way will I ever return! UGHHHH & EWWWW! I've now tried BJ's a handful of times. I would describe my experience with this large chain restaurant as very mixed. I would rate all of these experiences from horrible to just meh... the food filled up the void. This last visit was the ""hair"" that broke the camel's back! Let's start with the overall quality of the food: Mediocre at best. The food is fairly bland and unremarkable. Regarding how well the food is prepared: Poor.  On one occasion, I ordered salmon. It didn't just come out blackened, it came out burnt. As well, the sauce was missing. The so-called roasted asparagus turned into something resembling, inedible, fibrous hay. The rice pilaf was a tasteless pile. Temperature of all of the food was lukewarm to cold. I had to send every single thing back to the kitchen and pray no one hocked up a loogie on what replaced it. The replacement meal was a slight improvement and they gave me a free pizookie dessert. The pizookie was the best part of the whole meal. Oy! Most of the other meals I had here were of similar caliber. Service:  I know others have complained about service, but I've always received adequate to excellent service. Ambience: Extremely noisy! Very loud chatter accompanied by multiple TVs displaying sports events. Now, for my most recent visit, the one that finally pushed me over the edge: I ordered a mozzarella and tomato salad and actually, I was quite surprised at how good it tasted. It was well spiced and the portion was generous. The textures were also interesting, a slight crunch accompanied the softness of the mozzarella and fresh tomatoes. The dish was finished with a visually interesting pattern of balsamic vinegar sauce. Then IT appeared! Just as I was about to enjoy the nearly last mouthful of tiny, cute, round, plump mozzarella balls, I spotted IT! YIKES GADZOOKS, OH MYYYY. There was a curly HAIR resting ever so gently on my mozzarella ball! Oy!  Sheeeesh. Gives new meaning to the word hairball! I called the manager over and the hair convo went something like this: Disgusted diner: ""Hi, do you know that the human hair is one of the dirtiest things on the planet? The guys in the back wear hair nets?"" Manager: ""Yes, we follow all health department rules and regulations."" Disgusted diner: ""Well, I guess one, little hair just snuck out!"" Manager: ""Oh, I'm so sorry that happened to you, would you like another one?"" Disgusted diner: ""No, I don't want another HAIR!"" Manager: ""Is there something else I can get for you?"" Disgusted diner: ""No thank you."" Then, the manager patted my back in a very awkward, creepy fashion I found totally creepy and awkward. Disgusted diner: ""I think you should comp my meal."" Manager: ""Hmmmm."" Then, he walked away. The sweet server returned and said she would speak to him. She did, and he comped the meal. I made sure to tip her anyway, but she was surprised. Wasn't her fault. She deserves to work in a better restaurant. I hope her tips are never lacking or reduced due to poor food. After this debacle, I did choke down some of the mediocre main course, but my appetite hadn't recovered. King Tux, my BFF foodie review partner was very dismayed he didn't get to sample anything. Now, he's really, really pissed at me. Poor guy just didn't understand!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=180,2.64,2.51,2.536,2.052,2.5620000000000003

We followed the arrows and pulled up behind a line of cars that were just sitting there empty. We waited a few minutes for someone to come to us. Nothing. Finally we walked all the way up to the valet stand and this guy is just standing there lookong at us as we walked up. I asked if the valet was still open and he seemed visibly annoyed that I asked this. He said yes, they were open and then just handed me a ticket and said $7.00. No smile. No pleasant greeting. No explanation. No apology. Nothing. Ugh Oh! And when I handed him my keys I asked,""Oh do you know which car I'm in?"" I didn't think he knew because we parked so far back. That is how many empty cars that were just waiting there to be parked. This dude immediately responds that yes he knew and tells me the make of my car. So my question is...if he saw us pull up why didn't he come over to help us? Initially I didn't know what to do! Leave my keys in the car? Bring them with me? I mean, what the hell!! Next we had to deal with the 2 young black hostesses. It was a Saturday night at exactly 7:20pm. Whoever these two chicks are, they should be fired. As hostess you're usually the first rep for the restaurant. These two girls were sour faced, dry, unpleasant, unfriendly, dismissive and an overall buzz kill. Why are these two working as greeters when they seem like they can't conjure up the energy to freaking give a half smile!?! The worst. I hate bitch set faced hostesses. The girl that actually seated us was nice. Our waiter was Taylor or Tyler. Very nice. But he was overwhelmed. Therefore we were often ignored and got shitty service. He was dealing with a lot of big parties. He needed help. He got very little help. Therefore my party of 5 sat for long periods without getting orders taken...hungry as hell...nobody ever refilled our waters, our appetizer came out and we had no plates or utensils for a long while.  I'm not mad at Taylor/ Tyler. I think he did his best. He had no support. Where were the people to refill water at least?? Damn!! Anyway the broccoli cheese soup had a weird consistency last night like it had been sitting out for too long. But the ahi poke was sooo good. Very fresh.  I tool off a star for the crappy valet when we arrived (although the guys were ON IT and friendly when we left at around 10pm) and another star for the two horribly sour hostesses, and the overall slow service.

At least that's what most of their food tastes like. I've been to several locations, like Tustin, Century City, and a few others, but this location is probably the least impressive.  Came here for my parent's birthday because my mom wanted to use her coupon for a free appetizer. We ordered the fried calamari, which came out pretty quickly, though nothing special. I ordered the North Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and Shrimps, which is kinda like a cioppino with cous-cous. A little salty from the kalamata olives, but I liked it. What I didn't appreciate was that my mom's burger came out more medium-rare when she ordered medium-well. And. My sister's burger first came out medium-well when she ordered medium-rare. She sent it back and the second time around, got a pretty well done burger with rare bits along the edges. She expressed her concerns to the waiter, who informed the manager. The manager came over and apologized, offered her another burger to go and then sent out some free pizookies. There was almost no point, seeing as my sister had already eaten most of the burger because she was that hungry and didnt want to wait for another burger. I appreciate their efforts to rectify the burger situation, but it sorta just goes to show how things are running in the kitchen. Maybe no ones paying attention to the grill? Do they know how long to cook a burger to different degrees? Not to mention, my dad's shrimp scampi pasta was beyond dry. Like, absolutely no sauce to spare. Not even olive oil collected at the bottom. Dry dry dry. He ate it because he's not the type to say something even though he was unhappy about his own birthday meal.

325,Quincy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,20,22.0,1.0,2015-08-01,So last night me and a couple of friends were out and we were hungry so we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza so we chose bj's and when we got there our sever was nice he gave us time on taking our order even when we were indecisive so when we finally chose we had ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer which I thought was really good and my friend ordered the cheddar broccoli bread bowl she let me try and it wasn't half bad but it was more bread than soup little to none actually and me and my other friend decided to get a deep dish together and that was hands down the worst deep dish pizza I've experienced the when it first was brought out to us the pizza look a little flat to be a deep dish and when we tried to take it out of the pan which was another battle trying to get it out of the pan and when we finally did my friend notice the dough was still raw even the waiter noticed it as well and took it back then the manager came out and asked us about then he said he'll put it back in the oven so the second time it came out it looked really burnt around the edges and he also had a hard time taking out the slices and the slices were way uneven then eventually he said that he'll pay for the pizza he clearly knew that it was messed up so when we started eating it again the center of it was still doughy so I pretty much ate off the top and I had to order something else cause I was still hungry I had got the carnita fries now those were really good  I'll have to rate the service ie the waiter a four out of five and the pizza the thing we came for a zero  very disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=280,2.28,2.48,2.496,2.084,2.4

I called ahead to make a reservation but as soon as I got there, they told me that they were setting up the table. Turns out, we have to wait a whole 20 minutes for our party to be seated. So then, what's the point of a reservation? And it takes 20 minutes to set up a table? I don't think so. When we were seated, it took a while for us to order because our server didn't come around till 5-10 minutes after we were ready. On top of that, our food literally took forever. We were probably waiting a good 25 minutes for our food. Luckily, I managed to down 2 beers in the meantime. I might as well make use of the downtime.  Usually when I go to BJ's, I always order some variation of the deep-dish pizza. I love the thick dough, as opposed to thin crust pizza. This time, I got the Gourmet Five Meat -- medium size. What first irked me was the fact that the pizza wasn't properly cut! They didn't cut it ""deep"" enough!!! We had to spend the next couple of minutes cutting it ourselves. Somehow, the pizza this time wasn't up to par with my experiences in the past. It might have been due to the cold temperature that the pizza came out at. Not only that, I don't think the pizza wasn't properly made....Let's just say the people who ate the pizza spent some time in the bathroom. TERRIBLE.

Both were a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't make better. The atmosphere was good. I was seated at a table just off the bar area and took in the football game while eating. One negative note, and this echoes the sentiments of a few other recent reviews: Service wasn't great.

Not the case, they only have her a free pazooki and when she wanted a different pizza made right to go, Felix said no problem we will replace the pizza insinuating he wasn't gonna charge but we get the bill and he said we had to pay. Fact of the matter is his language to convey his message was not clear and he literally argued with us WITH his staff annnnddd they gossiped about what happened with other staff in front of the customers (us and other guests)!

Grabbed a table in the open seating bar area. 1) We made no change to the seats, but were asked to move 1 chair bc it was 'in the way of servers'. Okay, makes sense, but why didn't one of the many employees walking past move it while empty, before we sat down and had been waiting to be greeted? 2) Drink orders arrive - WEAK. The mojito was sugar water. They also arrived to the wrong people.. We fixed. 3) Order apps with no issue. Delivered, with no silverware - another server helped us out. 4) Apps have been finished for a solid 10 minutes before we have to flag down our server & ask to order. He just stares angrily, opens his notepad and waits. Zero words lol. 5) Food arrives 45+ minutes later.. Watched 2 tables that arrived after us receive their food. This is where we all get pretty grumpy 6) My burger is well done and cold but I'm starving so I stay quiet. 7) Food arrived without 1 order - that one shows up 20 minutes later when we are all done. At this point we've barely had acknowledgment from our server & he hasn't said more than 'sorry'. Doesn't ask if everything is ok, if he can get us anything else, etc. The classic drop & dash 8) We call a manager. He offers us dessert - that's great! The issue is we don't want to wait. He assures us they will be out very quickly. 9) 15 minutes later we flag down our server & ask for our checks, as well as the desserts to be boxed. The apparently cannot do this because they would need to be remade. 10) Check arrives in 1 (WTH?!) - we do the splits 11) Desserts arrive & one is cold.  Overall things went from 'meh' to comically bad. 2 of us have been bartenders/servers for years and had no words to help placate our group. We left tips but the lowest most of us had ever left.

My friend ordered the Atlantic salmon and i ordered a simple broccoli cheddar soup and caesar salad. The salmon was dry and overcooked, the medley of vegetables that accompanied the dish were cold (didn't seem fresh) almost microwaved....the soup was thicker than I had expected but even worst, my salad had bits and pieces of meat in it, I asked for no meat as it makes me sick. Sidebar, we had also ordered a jalapeño cucumber margarita and Royal soda...this bartender made an even lazier attempt than the cook. Drinks were nothing special, poorly crafted and flat. When brought to the attention  of our server, the manager was presented. The manager, Felix then continued to poke and pull apart the salmon explaining that if he puts in another order then ""it will probably come out the same. It won't be to your satisfaction."" He then continued in a manner in which he pressured my friend and I to order a different item off of the menu. Of course we didn't but that's neither here nor there.

My friend and I got there on Saturday around 130pm. It was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. There were two large parties of 20+ people but luckily they had already been served or were being served so I figured service wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong. We were seated for 10 minutes before anyone came by to introduce themselves and take our drink order. By this time we had already decided what to get. My friend got the mini pizza and salad lunch special and I decided to get the small pizza to have some leftover for lunch the next day. The waitress repeated our order and most was incorrect so we re corrected her. We were hopeful she would get the order right when placing it. Nope, we were wrong. It took about 30 minutes once we placed the order for our food to come out (my friends salad came first). Once the food came out we realized the pizza were the same size, a mini. I ordered a small. I didn't mind it was a mini but I would have ordered the lunch special if that was the case (it was $4 cheaper and came with a salad). We explained and the waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to wait for the small. No I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. They were nice and ended up giving us $5 off, but service overall was terrible. We didn't see our waitress half the time, the bathrooms were dirty and only 2 stalls had toilet paper.

I like the original chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream, but it's hardly enough for me to share. I definitely think they've shrunk over the years. But what can you do? Overall, it's an OK place for a little appetizers with the group to share and drink some beers on tap. I usually get a flight, but again they are run-of-the-mill beers nothing too impressive.

My boyfriend got the turkey burger, and he said the texture of the burger was really strange. The patty was mushy... as if the burger wasn't 100% turkey and there was some kind of grain mixed in.

Called 15 minutes later and the card had magically disappeared. Today, I noticed it immediately, and waited another 10 minutes to ask her for my card.

The service is terrible, whether busy or not, the service sucks!  One time it was empty and it still took 20 minutes to order, then another 20 to get our food.  After that experience I emailed corporate about it and they didn't even respond.  Last night confirms I will never spend another dollar in that place (even though I wasn't paying last night!).  Same thing, waited at least 15 minutes to place drink orders.  Our waiter was pretty attentive after that because we mentioned the wait, but it all fell apart at the end. We were brought our bill after we were done eating but my boyfriend decided to have another beer, so the waiter took the bill back. Then he was nowhere to be found for what felt like forever! It reached a point where I went to the front and asked the hostess to close us out.  Rather than her sensing my frustration and taking care of us, she proceeded to take my check and $100 bill and disappear to the back to locate the waiter.  When he emerged from the back, he proceeds to drop drinks off at another table and spends time with them taking orders or something. He then walked away from their table without even stopping by to apologize for the delay or anything.  He had to of known we were pissed because the hostess had given him our bill so I would have expected him to check in with us. Then I spotted him at cash out location, at that point I walked over there asked for my change, it was 10:30pm by this time.  I'd say we got there around 8:30pm. One other thing to note, earlier in the experience, my boyfriend went to wash his hands in the men's restroom, and slipped on the wet floor by the sink.  Luckily he didn't actually fall but went to tell the manager it needed attention and how serious it could have been.  The manager didn't seem to care and didn't even offer to comp us something (not that we needed him to or were expecting it but clearly he wasn't even worried about us possibly complaining the higher ups, which that is next on my to-do list). To top it off my boyfriend ordered the sirloin, which was the smallest piece of meat I've ever seen at a restaurant.  All in all, the food wasn't good, then combine that with the worst service ever, I would not recommend!

I was hungry so I dove right in.... My husbands entree: pizza (requested no tomatoes) came out covered in tomatoes. He told the server, and the server took it back to the kitchen.

Now, the pizookies come in two different size options: 1= a ""regular sized pizookie"" which is about 6"" I believe, or 2= a ""Pizooke Trio"", in which you get to choose 3 tiny different-flavored pizookies of your choice. Full tummies call for a regular sized pizookie (for 2 people to share) and you can ask for half and half flavors! My favorite is their Oreo flavor and my bf likes their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, which means it's a win/win for us! Prices are reasonable, and there is a parking area located right outside, or you can park in the mall and walk all the way to it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=240,2.4,2.43,2.52,2.416,2.418

While the food quality is ok, they just cannot serve an efficient lunch or get any order right. In fact the last time we went last Wednesday was the worst you could imagine. My law partner got the soup and salad and I got a turkey burger with a few changes as to the toppings. My law partner got his soup and salad before mine, which is fine, but twice I was assured that my turkey burger was coming out soon. After waiting 45 minutes the waitress asked if my law partner would like another salad and he said he did but not until my food came out. The manager then brought out my turkey burger but would not answer our question as to what went wrong.  Even worse, the waitress never came back to get my lunch companion to get his salad. And when I got the bill they only took my lunch off but not my law partner's who waited forever for my lunch and did not get the rest of his. We left a small tip and left. And never to be back again.  This has occurred time and time again and the kitchen and wait staff are unable to serve a business lunch where we can get back in an hour. We drive 15 minutes each way to La Dijonnaise and get our much better and less expensive lunch and are back before an hour passes. BJ's Culver City is a disgrace. My law partner was so offended that his lunch was not free after having to wait for an hour for me to eat.

It took us a long time to find parking but we finally did in the parking structure . We walked through the mall and outside to the get to BJs, which wasn't that far of a walk like I thought it would be . It was kind of weird to me that the wait was about 15 minutes but they had so many empty tables and so many servers working . We finally was called for our table and the host was walking quite fast and we almost lost him because he seemed like he was in a rush. We finally was seated and our waiter came by and greeted us . I must say he was GREAT. I wish I would have gotten his name but I do know he has an Irish accent because we asked him where he is from. He was able to recall our whole order without writing anything down, and we had a lot of stuff just for the three of us ! He even was happy to change my drink to strawberry lemonade last minute because I originally ordered a Shirley temple . I ordered the queso dip w chili which was pretty watery to me but it tasted okay and a bbq brisket and bacon burger with wedges that was really good. My dad had hot wings , clam chowder which was also watery compared to normal but was still good and the root beer ribs which he ate in 5 seconds. Last my uncle had garlic Parmesan wings which were sooo good and the new spaghetti and meatballs . Over all the food was good , I left very satisfied and full and the customer service was great .

Mind you I stay near Torrance and NEVER had a issue with the one in Torrance. My party ordered half boneless buffalo wings and the other half plain(fried) as a appetizer. The buffalo wings were  cold like the sauce was cold. Our food arrived after. My nephew kids pizza was hard as a brick and my daughter chicken Alfredo was slopped on her plate like whatever. No presentation at all.......my pizza came and it was under cooked. The bottom of the pizza was white....the plain wings I ordered was buffalo and I told the waitress the first time, ""PLAIN"".........she came back with the chicken but more coated and darker. I told her for the third time plain. Maybe I said plain buffalo wings. That may have caused the confusion. My family heard plain........My sister asked to speak with the manager who really doesn't present himself as a manager.....more like the bus boy......that moved up and it was his first day or a filler in because the real manager called out. He was unapologetic as a manager shouldn't be. I'm sorry that happened to you......what can I do to make this experience better. NONE of that flowed from his mouth. He brought back the pizza and wings and asked how does it taste and I said it SEEMS cooked and I tasted a bite and it was ok but after eating the slice of pizza......it tasted like a box pizza that still was doughy on top like a box pizza. He walked away........no thought into what discount was going to take place. He then came back as I summoned him and explained that I was disappointed in the service and that the only people in my party that had to wait for their food was my daughter and I. I explained that I don't come to this BJ and only came because we were passing this one from a joyous time at Universal Studios. He said ok......I said I normally go to Torrance because I stay out there. He then went to say I stay in Torrance and what part of Torrance do you live. I took that as being sarcastic and told him i stay in Hawthorne.....He then said ok. Unapologetic he was........I asked what type of discount was he going to give us for being inconvenience and he said he is going to pay for the Chicken Alfredo and Pizza. I was ok with that BUT had he been a BETTER manager fill in (I think). I would've probably came back. Not as much but I would've came back.......maybe once to see how the new experience would be. Since that didn't happen.......I'll use my hard earned money elsewhere. One more thing.......don't let the curly out of whack hair full you because IM SURE my pay check will make your eye BUCK Mr. Manager!!!!!!

The Manager Felix processed to walk up to her uncle and ask him questions and he got nervous and ran to the patio section of the restaurant. Felix then tried to run after him and we all told him to leave him alone and sent his sister after him to calm him down. There were 5 of us all letting him know that we had it under control and he would make it worse. Felix then said Okay but went around to a different door to enter the patio where they were. The Uncle came back to us while his sister was trying to tell the manager to leave him and explain his condition then another manager processed to our table. He asked us if he was with us and we all told him (6 adults) that he was with us and that he has a mental health issue and we are taking care of it and that strangers would make the situation worse. By this time the uncle had gone back into the patio area and the new manager then went out there to check it out. 1) He was not a danger to anyone. 2)He had been there with us over 2 hours quietly eating his food and when he was done he stood there quietly and watched tv. 3) It was embarrassing for our family for the manager to make a bigger stink about it then needed. Have they not dealt with someone with issuses or what? He had been there with us since we got there and we spent 300+ dollars on our bill and for us to walk out unhappy and embarrassed is ridiculous. 4) Your staff especially the manager should know how to deal with situations like these.

Here is my story. I have been a huge fan of BJ's and specially their avacado eggs rolls , best beginnings and Buffalo Pizza. I can literally eat that everyday. I had many facebook post which showed the check-in in BJ's. So my friends knew i am BJ Fnatic. One of friend was visting from NY and as soon as he landed at LAX he said lets go to eat at BJ's since he wanted to see why I go there so often.  Firstly we order drinks 1 Non-alcholic Pina Colada and one Sam Adams Pitcher. it took forever to drinks to come. First I thought they are trying to bring pina colada and beer together but that was not the case. Even after pina colada came in it took good 10 mins to beer to arrive. OMG next nightmare , the glasses given for beer were wet .. Wait what ? who does that !! I couldnt complain since I was trying to save the name of the restaurant and dont want my friend to feel bad about this.  Ok our appetizers was best beginnings and avocado eggs rolls , which came after 35 mins and they were COLD !!!! As if they just came out of fridge after being kept out for sometime.  Many of the things in the best beginners was not even eatable. Somehow we ate some and couldnt gulp down rest of it. Main entree was Veggie Pizza and Buffalo Pizza Large. The buffalo pizza was dead cold , this was much colder than the entree. I mean seriously guys , first thing which came in my head , this must have sat on the counter for good 30mins for this to get that cold.  The biggest nightmare , the Veggie pizza we order we couldnt eat it in restaurant since we were just 3 of us and we were full so early because of cold food. So when we went home , I was trying to eat Veggie pizza and I found beef piece in it...HOLY SMOKES I dont eat BEEF !!!!!  I had to throw that pizza  out too..  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.....

We put in our order and the first thing that came out was the soup not the appetizer which wasn't such of a big deal. Except.. THERE WAS A STRIP OF PLASTIC INSIDE MY SOUP! Then the main course came which I dont know about you guys but I'm pretty sure the appetizers come out first. So as we waited for the appetizer to come our food was getting cold. We got the appetizer late then we ate that and the server who by the way was the worst person ever to be working at any chain of restaurant. I'm not sure what his name was but he was tall skinny African American when we told him about the plastic he responded with ""oh there's plastic in there huh would you like. New one? Or just cancel it"" with a smirk as if that happened commonly NO I do not want a new one is it grenade or is it all made with plastic pieces inside? So anyways he took our main course to the warmer and then at that point my husband was upset and told the server we will take it to go he brought the bag without a check and it's common sense to bring the check he went about his way to go do something else and by that time We no longer wanted to be served by him or even be there. I was super upset that we would be paying for  a meal we didn't even eat and we were there for just 20 minutes we didn't enjoy our food I didn't think it was worth paying 50+ for an experience of that sort. But the money was not the point the point was that that customer service and the dangers of plastic in a soup is ridiculous what if a child was eating that. So I called the manager over and he was kind abit of a smart ass but he took care of the whole meal for us and that was awesome but I'm not one to complain because I work retail but when it's something that I would never want someone else to experience I will say something.

Our tab was $60 for two dinners and two drinks. Not wroth the price or service.  Much rather go to Yardhouse or CPK!

149,Tyler W.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,5,,1.0,2016-09-09,"This review is about the service (or lack thereof) and not the food. Our server at dinner tonight was extremely disinterested and inattentive from the moment we sat down.  Between my brother and I, we ordered Calamari for an appetizer, The Italian Market flatbread pizza, Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta and two drinks (as well as two glasses of water). My brother asked for no peperoncini's on the flatbread pizza and I asked for no cheese on the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta.  No plates were brought out for the appetizer, peperoncini's were on the flatbread pizza and cheese was sprinkled on top of the pasta. Had to track down our server to get my pasta sent back (he didn't apologize, but I think the general manager did) and my brother just picked off the peperoncini's rather than go through the hassle of getting another one made. Looking back, it was pretty obvious that our server wasn't paying attention at all when we ordered because we never got our glasses of water as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=100,2.4,2.54,2.512,2.052,2.484

First time ever at this specific location. We walked in and got absolutely no greeting from either hostess up front. Which apparently set the tone for the whole dining experience. No server in the whole restaurant was smiling or friendly. Our server, Rachel seemed to have hated her job. She did not greet us, just asked what we wanted to drink as soon as she came up to the table. We ordered and to our food was not even mediocre. Cold fries, super tiny stuffed mushrooms, and cold pizza as well. We did not bring it to her attention however, because it seemed like she disappeared for up to 20 minutes at a time. We sat with empty glasses a good portion of the meal.  Our drinks were refilled once the whole time. After we had eaten, we got asked ""are you done? Or any dessert?"" not friendly at all. But, nonetheless, who can refuse a pazookie? When it came to the table she put the book down and said nothing, we had no clue it was even there. Then she comes back not even 2 minutes later and goes is this for me? When it finally was ready she took it without a word and returned it without so much as a bye, thank you, or have a nice day. Also, during the stay I used the restroom where an employee was standing in front of the sink and playing with her hair while chatting on the phone. I needed to wash my hands and the employee just stood there and didn't excuse herself to allow me to wash my hands.  It was nothing I would've expected at a Bj's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=320,2.32,2.52,2.508,2.148,2.44

My experience here with both the managers and the staff at the take out area is typically amazing. They give excellent service. The one thing they can work on as an overall location is their communication with customers. Sometimes the person working the take out area has to step away to get an order or something else, which I understand. On numerous occasions I've walked up to an empty desk and not been contacted until that worker gets back. It does not hurt the 2-4 people standing around the host desk or passing by to say ""hey just give them a second they'll be right with you"". Stop ignoring your customers, contact them.

92,Sterling S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,34,37.0,2.0,2016-10-06,"So, like the majority of reviews, this one is fueled by dissatisfaction.  My wife and I arrived exactly at 8pm and we seated promptly. There wasn't anyone waiting to be seated with the exception of a sizable party. I also noticed that about 20% of the restaurant was closed off. This tells me that this ISN'T a peak time. It felt like 15 minutes but probably more like 5 minutes, our server arrived. She was pleasant, took our drink order and disappeared into the either. Our drinks took another 10 minutes to show up. Probably because she was fulfilling what seemed like the entire restaurants drink orders. So after our server had distributed four thousand gallons of liquid refreshment, she returned to take our overly complicated order. Wife ordered a chicken something or other and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Tall order for any chef.  Now seeing how this place had vacant booths and was partially closed off, you would think that the food would arrive promptly. Nope 9pm rolls around and I've decided it's time to have ""that"" talk with the manager. I saunter over to the hostess counter and request the aforementioned manager. I'm told she was paged and would be there shortly. I wait...and wait...and wait for this magical person with all the answers to arrive and eventually, my wife flags me down that our food has shown up. Praise the lord, our food is here. I give up on the manger and go eat my unremarkable food. (It's spaghetti so my expectations aren't that high to begin with).  P.S. Manager never came by to follow up.  We've finished our meal and are finishing up with a Pizzokie, which is really the only reason to go to BJs. We got to witness this mythical manager bossing (she's the boss, right) her staff around in a very unprofessional manner. Kinda like the way a sixth grader treats a fourth grader.  End of meal, we asked the server why it took so long and she said ""maybe it's because we're busy"". I pointed out that part of the restaurant wasn't being used and there are many unused tables. We paid our bill and leave.  We've been to this location several times and the ONLY thing that gets us in the door is some kind of incentive (tonight's was a bogo). It's definitely not worth the wait, the food is mediocre, the service is pretty much non existent.  Unfortunate BJs, you're not that good and you're management reflects that, all the way down to the servers.

204,Lana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2016-11-22,"Visited this BJ's last Wednesday, which made me remember why I don't patronize this particular BJ's.  My family and I were satisfied until we paid for our meals.  We asked for two separate checks, which we received with no problem.  The issue was my bill was $66.19 and I paid $70 cash; my daughter's bill was $44 and some change, she paid $45 cash.  We waited close to 15 minutes at least for our change.  We had to ask another server to ask our server to bring our change and receipts.  Our server sent someone else to bring my change ($3.81).  My daughter never received her change.  I think our server assumed we wanted her to keep it as a tip.  However, I had her tip at the table ($10).  I was waiting to receive my change to add the $3 with the $10 to leave a tip of $13.  We asked to speak to the Manager because we had been waiting so long for our change and receipts.  The Assistant General Manager, Felix came to our table.  This is when things went South.  Our server finally came to give my daughter her change and slammed it down on the table with an attitude (in front of her Manager).  I tried to talk to her to let her know I had her tip at the table and I would never leave only a $3 tip.  She turned her back and walked away before I could finish my statement.  Felix the Manager did not acknowledge her rude, disrespectful and abrupt behavior.  When we called it to his attention, he became belligerent with a nasty sarcastic tone .  I will never return or patronize this BJ's again.  I asked Felix time and time again for his Manager's name.  He only insulted my intelligence and wasted my time by never giving me the information.  FELIX SHOULD BE FIRED!  This incident made me remember Felix and the reason why I don't visit this location.  I don't think retraining would help him at this point.  Felix exhibits a god-complex, which is very offensive.

This was our second time eating at a BJ and after our experience, Now I remember why we rather eat at Olive Garden, sizzler, or island... First, it took about 15 min. for waitress to come to our table and take our drink order. After getting our drinks, we placed our order, which took close to 45-50 mins (and it wasn't busy). Between the initial drinks and the food coming to our table, we sat there with empty cups. Oh did I mention that when my son received his chicken boneless wings (nuggets) the waitress did not bring utensils nor napkins I had to ask for it. Shortly after the first plate my second son received his bacon burger, which he wasn't satisfied because it only had two strips of bacon (and he is only 13), what would he know about food, oh did I mention that I asked again for utensil and napkins a second time and refills. So, my wife's salad and my pasta deep dish plate follow, and Yes we had to ask again for a third time for utensils and napkins! We thought it was just us, but we witness the same service with the two ladies sitting across from us, as they got there meals and sat there for about three minutes waiting for utensil as there food was getting cold.  At the end of our dinner nothing wowed us about the meals we had, in fact we walked away wishing we would of being more satisfied going down the street to island or sizzler . As for the service, I think BJ could follow Olive Gardens, sizzler or Islands table service.

For my entree I had the Deep Dish Ziti: house made meatballs, Italian sausage, diced pepperoni, marinara, cheese and fresh basil. When it arrived it looked like the picture. I was pleased with the flavor on the first bite. However, there was only a hint of Italian sausage. I took a few more bites and, to my disappointment, that's all there was: a hint of Italian sausage. I guess they ran out of meatballs and pepperoni. There were none in the entire deep of the dish.  My mom got the pulled pork sandwich. The hunks of pork were so large I think I heard them ""oink."" And instead of the meat being in the bbq sauce, it came on the side in a little sauce cup that barely covered the sandwich. And the ""crispy"" onion strings were not crispy at all. The fries were lukewarm. They brought her more bbq sauce when she asked but she has had better pulled pork sandwiches at other BJs locations.  There were 4 other people in our party.

Ok cool Got to an open seat waited for 20 mins to get it cleaned up. Waited another 20 mins to find out no happy hour. No biggie. Then waited for an hour for food. In the meanwhile, 2 other groups came in about 20 mins after we got seated and got there food (pizza and other entrees)  and left and paid, before we even received our food (a pizokie and sliders). Finished my water, and Once I got my food it took about another 20 mins to get a refill. The server was really busy and by herself. Can't blame the 1 server and busser. They are well understaffed.

I sang her Happy Birthday and while i sang the table next to us received the real Birthday treatment. To say the lease our time at this BJ sucked! Wasn't Horrible wasn't Great.

This review is all about the poor customer service. Our waitress Contessa never introduced herself or smiled. She was in a rush and a bad mood. It took about 20 minutes to get silverware dumped in a pile on our table. She then failed to deliver meals in a timely manner (30 minutes) so they were all lukewarm. Soggy sandwich, cold pasta, lukewarm ribs and fries. One meal NEVER arrived nor did the dessert we ordered.  A female manager came to the table with no hospitality skills and made the experience worse.  I read a few reviews and it seems like my experience is typical there. I wish I would have checked yelp before going. How many bad reviews will they get before they take action?

Natasha E. was very rude, she came to ask us what to order, without introducing herself to us... just basically asked us for our order, and when we kept her there for a few seconds, she walked away from our table as we were talking to her as if she had something more important to do other than to do her job and serve us. She didn't come by to ask us if we needed anything extra, not even to ask if we were satisfied with our meals. It was just the worst. And when she would talk to us, she seemed to be in a rush due to the fact that in the middle of us talking she would be in the middle of leaving.

31,Allisen B.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-08-05,"So, here's the deal. I've been working in the restaurant industry for over 6 years, so I completely understand not getting 5 star, or even decent service on a busy night. Really, I get it. But honestly, my experience at this BJ's was one of the worst experiences I have EVER had at any restaurant in my entire life.  My friend and I (both server/bartenders) came in on a Thursday night. The restaurant was full, but we sat down immediately. Our server, I don't remember his name, but he was a tall African American fella, came to greet us immediately. He was very loud and almost robot like. Reminded me of a used car salesman. Which was fine. I have my own strange persona that I put on sometimes when serving. We ordered drinks. She got a coke and I got a Sauvignon Blanc. Then he rushed away. Our drinks took 25 minutes to arrive and we never saw our server in between that time. We had to flag down the server in the section next to him in order to order our food! I got the garlic Parmesan carrots (I really only came for the wine and a Pizookie. Yo girl had had a rough day) and my friend got an appetizer. About 5 minutes later, my friend decided she also wanted a salad. We flagged down that same nice server and she ordered the salad with him. Finally, we got our drinks. 15 minutes go by, and my friend's salad arrives. Yay! Another minutes go by. Her appetizer arrives. My carrots are nowhere to be seen. Another 20 minutes go by. Mind you, we haven't seen our server since he took our drink orders. Not once did he come to check on us to make sure we were okay.  I finally flagged down that nice server (kudos to him!) and inquired about my carrots. He profusely apologized for the carrots being lost in translation, and brought them out about 10 minutes later. They were okay. I mean I wasn't expecting much, but definitely not worth the 35-40 minute wait at this point. Finally we're done. We wait another 10 minutes until we FINALLY see our actual server again. He apologizes for the mix up with my carrots and brings me a free mini pizookie (which I was going to get anyway because I downloaded the app) with the bill. When we take a look at the bill, my FRIEND'S SALAD was taken off the menu. The item that came first! She offered to pay for my carrots, which was nice. We never saw that server again. We waited another 10 minutes before deciding to just pay up at the front.  Like I said, I understand if a server is having a rough night, or if it's really busy. I work at a restaurant that's notorious for 25-30 minute tickets times on a Saturday night. But we sat at that table for over an hour and a half and we only saw our server twice. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine, my food was completely forgotten about, no one asked how we were doing or if we even enjoyed the meal. I felt like we were totally forgotten about! I was so disappointed. I don't go out very often, and when I do, I want the experience to be worth it. This was definitely a waste of a night off for me.  To any Manager's who are reading, you need to train your employees to pay more attention to your customers. It's really disappointing and embarrassing when you have two girls who know the restaurant struggle get absolutely terrible service. Either you need to hire more people or you need a team meeting. I will absolutely not be coming back.  (Giving two stars because the bathrooms were clean and stocked, and for that nice server who took the time to take care of us even though we weren't his table.

Other than that I was going to have us all meet for my birthday at the Downey location instead. Since I live near the Downey location but my best friend lives in Culver City off the 10 freeway we wanted a halfway point for both of us so this worked out fine. It was small group of us 4 adults and 2 kids out celebrating my birthday last night over some appetizers, deep dish pizza, beer and the best part some pizookie. Everything went well, we had a great server at the beginning who unfortunately had to go on break right after he took our food orders and left his coworker Kayla in charge the remainder of the time. Kayla was sweet and prompt who complied with all of our requests in a timely manner but the other guy, who's name I can't remember just a short latino guy with a beard and mustache, simply made us feel welcomed. He was cracking jokes and reminded me of that one crazy ass cousin who becomes the life of the all family gatherings. In my opinion!!!! Now moving on to the food... the spinach and artichoke dip was good but not better than claim jumpers, the lettuce wraps were fantastic, the lettuce was fresh and the chicken was cooked just right. The pizza I was disappointed in, this place claims to be Chicago style but I'm sorry not even close hunny buns. I would gladly get on the next flight to Chicago and have a slice of Giordano's pizza instead before I have another taste of BJ's pizza. Sorry!!!!  I give this place 5 stars for the location, the parking and service hope to be back again real soon at least for the pizookie and another beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=80,2.88,3.01,2.728,2.42,2.9579999999999997

My friends and I had a weekday lunch here. The place was almost empty. Service was slow until after we ordered our drinks. The staff was friendly and I like how our waitress checked in with us asking how our entrees were. I recommend the Enlightened Menu for healthier choices. Healthier as in your dish may have 800 calories, not more than twice that, but Enlightened meals taste good and the portions are large. I had the quinoa, mushroom with shrimp. It was great, so flavorful. There was brown rice mixed in but they surprisingly piled on the shrimp. At Cheesecake Factory, the only healthy item that was tasty was a flatbread and that isn't filling.  My friend liked her Enlightened lemon chicken over rice dish. My other girlfriend got a grilled cheese with fries and loved it. BJ's also has lunch specials until 3 pm (I believe). Their prices are very fair for what you get. It's a nice looking, well-designed restaurant with many choices to please all palates and ages. Hard to resist their Pizookie but they have a mini-one now to reduce guilt. The bar area is cool for watching sports. I like the bright amber panels next to the tv's. There is also a special brunch snack menu on Sundays during the NFL season for indulging or stress eating depending on how your team is doing lol.

The kitchen and management share the blame as well for this debacle. We were seated after 11am figuring that since they opened at 10am they would be good to go for the day guess not. Ordered coffee and was told it was brewing which is fine. But then is comes 30 min later right before the first half of our food came out. Now to the food. One in our group ordered a simple breakfast of sausage, eggs, and potatoes and some how the chef forgot the potatoes. I ordered an open face burger with a fried egg on top and they forgot the egg. So instead of taking the plates back to get fixed 20 min later a fried egg on a plate and a side of potatoes comes out. Around the same time as my daughter's breakfast came. We all finally start eating when the last person in our group that we thought may have gotten away with no issues finds a long think black hair scrambled into her eggs. That was it. I didn't have the stomach to eat anymore. Her plate was taken off the bill but that was it. Nothing from the manager on duty.

Waited 30 minutes to be seated when I was told the wait was only 5.  2. Waitress (did not catch her name but she's a blonde young girl) did not come to our table once within a 30 minute time frame. So we eventually got out order taken by another waitress that at first refused to take our order until I said to my friend ""Nevermind let's go"" which cause her to be completely apologetic afterwards. 3. Our first waitress (blonde girl) came back and after we informed her that some else took our order she had a lot of attitude. Later in the night we asked her if we could have some ketchup and her response was  ""Did you want me to tell your server or did you want me to be your server again""  Completely rude.

Experience #2 was a visit on a Saturday evening for the prime rib special.  It was outstanding, and definitely a 5.  Salad was fresh, prime rib was prepared perfectly and the rice pilaf was adequate.  The dessert is still in my freezer, waiting for the right moment.

We had to get the attention of a manager (who was very helpful) just to get something as basic as water. I've worked in hospitality so I understand it getting busy and not being able to immediately come to a table but if she had even acknowledged us to let us know that she was busy and would be with us in a moment then I wouldn't have been as upset. When she finally did approach us on the request of her manager, she had an attitude for being called out on her mistake and did not apologize..so that already shifted the entire mood of our meal. Long story short, we ended up packing up everything to go within 5 minutes of getting our food because the overall experience was that horrible.

I ordered jambalaya, the waitress asks me what salad do I want with that ? - I didn't want any salad or asked for it, so I asked if it comes with a salad , which she replied that I don't have to take it... implying once again that it's part of main course and comes as a side dish. So I insisted and asked - I know I don't have to ... I don't have to take shrimp with the jambalaya but it does come with it ... does it come with the salad ? She kept answering ""you don't have to take salad"". I got upset and asked ""just tell me if you charge extra for the salad or it comes free as a side dish ?"". She finally admitted it cost extra. So I said so why you confuse me with stuff I didn't ask for - if I wanted a salad I'd ask for it! And I kept ordering the food - then she just left... in the middle of my order - while I was talking ... and refused to serve us. But she didn't tell us for like 20 minute so we are waiting there for a waiter but no one comes ... Till we gave up and left. What kind of waitress leaves in the middle of an order whiles the customer speaks to her ?? And leaves us to dry ?? If you can't deal with feedback from customers - don't be a waitress !!  You represent an establishment as a waitress - a chain of restaurants - you cannot be that rude to clients !! Period. And what kind of scam is that ? You don't ask ""what salad would you want with that ?"" When it doesn't really come with a salad - you ask ""would you want a salad with that ?"" , that's misleading and she knew it as twice she refused to answer it properly ... until I asked her ""do you charge extra for it ?"" She had no choice but to say yes...  But then she left the table in the middle of my order and just never came back... while we were waiting ... not really understanding what just happened.

916,Monique P.,"Hawthorne, CA",143,6,1.0,1.0,2017-10-10,On Sept 8th 2017 I made reservations for 20 people for a 80th birthday celebration on 10/07/17 I spoke with Kyle. We have celebrated special events at BJ's and have always had such a wonderful experience that my mother choose this location once again. I arrived at 3:30 for a 4pm reservation and was told was no record of a reservation for my group.  I was told we could be accommodated if we didnt mind being seated on the patio.  The sun was blinding and extremely uncomfortable but we were told there were no shades we were then told by our waiter (who was pleasant) that he would take our order although he still had to take care of other tables inside. To start off there were 2 dinner salads served about 15 min before the next order.  There for the orders were brought out in shifts.  By the time 1st and 2nd shift the 3rd and 4th shift orders were just being served.  Most of the food was cold.  There for if our pervious events on a scale of 1 to 10 would have been rated a 9 1/2. How ever this occasion is rated at a 1 or 2.  The dishwasher broke down so we were not able to get glasses of water they brought out several orders that did not belong to our group. And a steak so tough my daughter broke her tooth as she bit into it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2,2.12,2.94,2.672,1.924,2.612

I'm all for spending money in the community, and in this area is where I grew up as a kid, went to Fox hills mall too many times as a kid and a teenager. But this area right here is too congested, I can never find parking. I knew it was a bad idea to pick this BJ's when I suggested it to my friends for our last outing and for my sons birthday dinner.  My best friend got there before I did while I was making rounds in the parking lot trying to find somewhere to park. Finally after parking in the covered parking structure and walking too far just to get to the restaurant I went to the reception area and asked the hostess where I could find my party which happened to be right behind her. I walked over and waited because we had a few more people coming, when the rest of the guest arrived we told our Waiter ""James"" that it was not enough room. Oh let me add that when I got there my friend had already ordered stuffed mushrooms.....  So we're moved to another table to the left of the restaurant and it wasn't enough room, so we were moved back to where we were with another small table added. After about 10 minutes ""James"" came to take our order and went to the back to put in our order.  After waiting for about 30 minutes we summoned James again to ask him what was the holdup on our dinner. He said that he would check and walked to another table. Ten minutes or so they come out with our food one by one..... but the kids still had not received their food and neither did my friends stuffed mushrooms ever come out.  Finally the kids food come out about another 7 minutes. We eat and it's time to pay the check. My friend tells them that this order of stuffed mushrooms never came. So that needs to be deleted. Finally we get up and leave walk out after we pay our bill and I go to the car and and we drive off. Five minutes into traffic my son tells me that he forgot his birthday cards with gift cards in the envelopes on the table at the restaurant. Immediately I turn the car around and proceed to call BJ's on the phone. The hostess answers and I tell her that my son left his cards on the table. She put me on hold and comes back and says she didn't see any cards on the table. I tell her  I'm on my way.  I get there and I show her the exact table that we were sitting at. I have her call James and I'm asking him what happened to my sons cards he says he doesn't know and goes to the back to ask The busboy..... ok now I'm pretty sure James saw those cards when he picked up hid tip off of the table, but he is clueless now? Now I'm pissed because this is not cool. How could someone take a kids gift cards on his birthday. I was so pissed and hurt and so was my son and god daughter because one of the cards was one she had personally made for my son. I believe James or the busboy lied.

Someone singlehandedly picks every piece of sausage off the pizza (that they can see), adds more cheese to cover the holes and puts it in the oven. Crust looking very crusty.  The manager comes over to explain they were 'very busy' and they'll bring another; not acknowledging that SOMEONE FRIGGIN PUT THEIR WHOLE HAND  IN THE PIZZA I'm suppose to eat and removed a whole topping.

He told me it had only been a couple minutes. When I said it had been several minutes he started to argue with me. He then left to check on it. The issue is he had printed the receipt and the time on it showed it had clearly been 20 minutes. It would have been fine if he had just admitted his mistake but his need to argue with me really ruined the night. I shared the story with the manager and did receive an apology. He spoke with the bartender who then proceeded to help everyone at the bar except for me. So word to the wise, if you decide to sit at the bar and don't feel like an argument avoid Nesly R.

It's a terrible visual experience, with sauces spilling over and the food just looking absolutely unappetizing. The ""wings"" aren't even wings. They're just bits of chicken coated in a super thick batter - probably more than 60% of each bite is batter.  I ordered a clam chowder in a bread bowl as well. There's barely any soup and mostly the sourdough bread. 8 bucks for that. What a rip off. The entrees come out - including a couple of small pizzas. My entree - a ribeye steak - was asked to be cooked in medium. You know, a warm pink center. There's not any pink to be seen. Instead, a grey overcooked piece of meat. Tough to boot, even though they claim to age the beef 28 days. Riiiiiiiiight. Can't get a refill on the drinks either. Get the check, the server is nowhere to be seen nor found. We wait and wait.

She brought me out the bill and still charge me for the draft beer. The first time my waitress brought out the tacos they looked normal, but they were chorizo. I reminded her that I ordered the vegetarian tacos. I also reminded her that I didn't get my brussles sprouts and was still charged for the angry orchard.  She apologized and told me she would have them remake my order. And she took my cash and receipt. After another 25mins she came back with my change still not including the drink she was supposed to take off and my new tacos. The tacos had nothing but steamed vegetables in them and there were no tomatoes. They had no cheese on them and they were missing the red wine vinaigrette. The pita was also cold. I asked her about the brussels sprouts and the bistro grains and she told me they were the bag. I began checking the rest of my order to find no honey siracha brussles sprouts and no bistro grains and the avocado in the eggrolls were black and the rolls were soggy like they had been sitting out. I tried to wait for my waitress but she was nowhere to be found. Then I opened my pizookie and it was like in a pile . I asked other workers they told me to talk to my waiter. At this time I had been there for over 2hrs and was close to being late for my flight so I left. I don't remember the waitress's name but she was short petite African American female.  She looked like she could be 18-23yrs old and she didn't seem to have much experience working there. I also don't have my receipt because she kept it when she went to go remake the tacos.  However, on 12/13 I called the restaurant back and requested to speak with a manager. I spoke with the worker in the bar area who told be one wasn't available but she took down my name and number and said she would have a  manager contact me by the end of the day. After a week went by and no one called I called a local Bjs restaurant to ask for information on how to get in touch with someone who could help. She told me to check online and hung up in my face.  It has been over three weeks now and I haven't received a call.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2?start=20,1.96,2.67,2.664,,2.386
904,Audrey N.,"Hilo, HI",30,38,63.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"So my dad ordered the sliders. When it got to us, he opened them to put his lettuce and pickles in, but oh my. The patties were so sad looking because they cut a whole patty into fourths. So lame. Also, menu says grilled onions. Asked our waiter to give on the side. He comes back saying it's actually grilled onions that is used to cook the patty for that ""grilled onion taste, but no actual onions my manager said. However I'm having them make new ones for you with grilled onions."" Wth?! Now we've been waiting for like 20mins for the new sliders. At least we won't be charged for two orders of sad sliders.  Also yes service is so slow. I get it, you're closing in an hour. But still. Cmon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2,2.0,2.65,2.664,,2.39
907,Tony C.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,,4.0,2018-01-10,"I was in the L.A. area on business before catching the red-eye back east. We stopped at BJ's outside of LAX for a light meal and a couple of beers before catching our flight. The food, atmosphere, customer service and price was great! A very nice menu to satisfy many pallets, a great selection of beer, wine and mixed drinks too. I noticed families with children, Millennials at happy hour and diverse group of patrons really enjoying themselves. I had the Seared Ahi Salad and it was fabulous! Wash this down with a BJ's Brewhouse Blonde and you won't go wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-culver-city-2,2.12,2.65,2.676,,2.438
