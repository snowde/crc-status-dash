They have a lunch special menu and I decided on the half grilled chicken pesto flatbread pizza & salad option.  The pizza/salad combo was just enough for one person and the it was good.  I have nothing to brag about from BJ's, so I do plan to go back again to try some of their menu items, since they have so many.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8280000000000003,3.2800000000000002

337,Jalynn S.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,2.0,2012-02-28,"Where to start...the only reason we decided to go to BJ's is because of the large selection of food. Because we showed up a little after 8 there wasn't any wait time which was good, since the last time I went to BJ's, I waited a whole hour before being seated. What really made BJ's a two star experience is the waiter. God bless him but he was in another world. I asked for regular lemonade, he asked if I wanted pink or strawberry, I repeated that I wanted regular yellow lemonade and he bought out pink lemonade. The person I was dining with originally asked  for tea and water, after 2 full glasses of tea and 20 minutes later we flagged down a waitress and she poured half a glass of water. I ordered a chicken pasta plate which was BLAND! Half the broccoli was softly steamed and the other tasted and felt raw. The waiter bought out the wrong book for the ticket, inside were tickets throughout the day which included people names and credit card numbers. Our waiter once again went MIA, at that point we should of walked out the door, but it was Sunday night, and we had nothing better to do anyways. Ten minutes later he showed up and apologized. Even though he was absent-minded he was very kind, so we still tipped him the usual 20 percent. It was okay, 2 stars from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=320,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8880000000000003,3.1200000000000006

And by super light, I mean I just ordered their stuff mushrooms and a water (didn't plan on having alcohol that night) - probably a server's worst nightmare knowing my tab was going to be so small. Oh, well... Stuffed mushrooms were delish! The order came with 6 small mushrooms drizzled with some sort of pesto sauce. Mine barely came with any, so I had to ask for an extra side of it because it tasted so good. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, by the way. I just don't think it's necessary for me to turn my head side to side and eyeball hunt for my server to fill my water which has been left empty for an X amount of long minutes. It wasn't even busy. It was 11PM on a Thursday night. Aside from the food and service, I have always liked the ambience of BJ's. This was my first experience at this particular restaurant, and I've been to a few other locations. The look and feel have always been the same.

138,Marilyn M.,"Dallas, TX",464,436,115.0,4.0,2012-04-30,"Yes, it's a chain, but one of my favorites. Craving a salad, checked out their menu on line and saw some new items.  So, off I go to this nearby spot with my Kindle in hand one late Sunday afternoon. As always, greeted by a friendly smiling hostess and taken to a comfy booth.  Cody, my server, promptly appears and welcomes me to BJ's.  He suggested their featured beer, Oasis Amber, his favorite, and I go with his recommendation.  And, yes, it was just 'delish; light but with a nice degree of depth.  And, I love the tall slim pint glasses that present the tasty brew. not to mention.  FROSTY COLD ! I had the BBQ Chicken Salad which consisted of tomatoes, corn, green onions, black beans, jicama, cilantro, mozzarella cheese, BBQ sauce and iceberg lettuce; I added sliced boiled egg.  I ordered the special BBQ ranch dressing on the side.  This humongous salad was made even better by the topping of  lots of crunchy, sweet onion strings.  The presentation was beautiful, so much so  I really hated to dig into this bowl of goodness  But, of course, I did. And, there were flavors galore, all blending so well for a scrumptious result.  And, that BBQ Ranch dressing? Whomever came up with this combination is a foodie genus.  Absolutely yummy! A side of BBQ sauce was also included.  The greens were cold, fresh and crisp; a generous portion of the tender, moist chicken and assorted veges made this a meal that could have easily been shared by two people. I also requested some garlic bread and Cody told me they could make some ""pasta bread"".  Those carbs were simply delectable.  Lightly toasted with Parmesan cheese, herbs and garlic. Crunchy and soft at the same time.  I could have easily eaten all 4 slices but used a modicum of self control.  (Surprisingly, there was no extra charge for this added item.  How nice!) I really enjoy BJ's.  The service, atmosphere and food is constantly consistent.  I've always had a good experience regardless of what food items I have selected; and the enormous variety of  menu options always fulfill my cravings of the moment.    All the servers seem to have the same philosophy of customer service which is ""treat the customer well and they'll return"".  And, I do, and I will :) It's a great atmosphere to sip on a cold brew and get a few more chapters in the book behind me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=100,3.08,3.41,3.41,3.184,3.278

I view them as a Cheese Cake factory with beer instead of Cheese Cake.  They don't really have a big specialty when it comes to food, but they make a TON of it.   Actually I take that back, CCF is pretty effing delicious.

It had  a good amount of melted cheese on top, but the chili came in a tiny bowl on the side, along with some sour cream. The amount of chili couldn't have been any more than a 1/4 cup.

This is where I fell in love with the avocado eggrolls and Jambalaya, which I've also had at the Lewisville location and it was just as fantastic, but didn't get it on this occasion. We stopped in with a party of 3 at 9pm on a Thursday for a late meal and the hostess mentioned that happy hour was going on in the bar ($2 off apps and $1 off drafts/cocktails), so we gladly steered ourselves to the last empty table. Our waitress took slightly longer than the time it took each of us going to the bathroom separately to greet us and then I think immediately wrote us off when only 1 out of 3 ordered alcohol. Apps: Cheese sticks - good, they were well...cheese sticks not much to say. Calamari - meh. Tuna Poke - yummmmyyyyyy! mmmmm! Cup of clam chowder - could be from a can but it was one of the best clam chowders I've had in a while, definitely recommend. Mains: Deep Dish Jalapeno and Pepperoni Pizza - we usually go for BBQ chicken pizza here, but this was highly undercooked and just not delicious at this location on this particular night. I've never not loved their pizza so this was highly disappointing. Turkey club - didn't try it but it got the thumbs up.

You will start with one of the largest most complex menus anywhere at this type of a restaurant. There were approximately 26 pages, more or less. Finding the page from which to decide was the first challenge and then finding the item on that age was the second challenge. I have no ideal how they manage to keep all of those products fresh and ready to serve. There are dozens and dozens of entrees. When I commented about this to the waiter he replied, I agree and about like the Cheesecake Factory. Well after several minutes of reviewing and getting over the initial shock our group attempted to regroup and place an order. By the way the prices are not inexpensive at this place so expect to pay a little more for what you get. I ordered the chicken fried steak which came with a side order. The steak was rather small fro the price ($13.50). In fact I had one a few days later that was two to three times larger for about $4 less. Go figure! While the steak was good there was nothing about it that one could say it was outstanding or fantastic. Another in out party had the Parmesan Chicken and they liked it very much.

I don't know who decided to call them ""mini"" because they are definitely big enough to share. And if you don't want their beers, they have a bunch of other tasty stuff on tap! They have one of those insane, Cheesecake Factory style menus that has a bazillion choices. I have no idea how these places manage to make so many different things well, but I always like the food I get. The avocado spring rolls, the angel hair pasta, the tomato soup, the pizzas, and most recently their mac & cheese have ALL been good!  Speaking of the mac & cheese, I'm loving this new small bites menu they have. It's always enough food for lunch but they are each under $5. The fried artichoke is a particular favorite of mine.

The two times I have been there I have also noticed other repeat patrons. Obviously the place draws regulars. Planet was attentive and helpful, recommending the Santa Fe salad which was delicious.

I say, butter doesn't have gluten in it..."" Silence. He tells me he's getting the kitchen manager. A few mins later I'm taken off hold only to hear two women talking in the background... ""You have to talk to her,"" ""I don't want to, she's going to be pissed."" This goes back and forth then a guy with a thick Hispanic accent comes on the phone and explains there is a lot of flour in the sauce...there's nothing he can do but tell me the ingredients, so I hang up. My boyfriend calls back only to be on hold for over 10 minutes. He is on his way there now. This is SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

Service took quite a while just to simply get waters. I started with a wedge salad and it was pretty pitiful. The lettuce portion was maybe the size of the palm of my hand. A little dressing was drizzled on and they basically tossed a pinch of onion and tomato on and called it a day. For my main course I ordered the balsamic chicken. I assumed Id get a chunk of chicken breast. Nope. I got two little chicken medallions and WAY too much balsamic sauce. They try to distract from the small chicken portion by tossing a ton of fried onion strings on top of it. The guy next to me ordered the bruchetta and it was pretty pitiful as well. It was 5 giant squares of bread with a teaspoon of topping on each. He had to ask for additional topping and oil. The topping to bread ratio was not even.

Ha. First off, the salad I had, I'm not even sure it had romaine lettuce and I'm positive the ""roasted turkey"" was nothing short of a poor quality lunch meat. I found 3 small pieces of feta and the avocado was brown and borderline bad. Oh, and no croutons.  I'm sure I will continue to come back as a  dine-in only patron.

As always there were 3-4 young women working at the front desk and we were quickly shown to a table. Great. Our friendly but too quiet server introduced herself and we ordered drinks and appetizers, then had to wait too long to order our entrees. Not a big deal. After about a 20 minute wait, my partner's entrée came out. It was delivered by a server who came from the front of the restaurant, not the kitchen. Strange but OK. After 10 additional minutes waiting for my entrée, with no check in from our waitress, I asked to see a manager. My entrée came out and the other entree was taken away to be ""remade"" since it was now cold. I had to ask for a pizza server since none was left by our waitress; the manager returned with one. My entree was a chicken bacon and ranch pizza, my partner had jambalaya. The food itself was really good, to be fair, but the service was poor - it seemed that the kitchen was not doing any favors for the servers last night. Two other observations - a diner at a neighboring table sent his pizza back because it was wet in the middle, and we noticed 3 servers standing around doing nothing while we waited for our food. Having worked at a restaurant before I can't ever recall having time to stand around and do nothing...

So 15 minutes later not in a big rush for the app but once 25 minutes passed we started to ask what was going on the response was"" it should be coming out now"" 5-10 minutes it finally comes out. It was good but not worth that long wait. Then the pizza and pasta came out about 15-20 after that, which I can't understand since I know it doesn't take that long. And then to top it off the pasta wasn't even hot.  So of course we ask for a manger and tell her what happened she tells us sorry and she doesn't know why that happened. Really wasn't too helpful at all. Then when the waiter comes back he tells us it's her last day on the job, so her attitude and unwillingness to help made sense. At the end of the day she took an item off our bill which really didn't matter since they knew we had the coupon. Not too happy about the situation.

We sat down immediately, our app came quick and the drinks were constantly full. I ordered a salad to start, a burger for my entree and my SO got a pizza.  The food came out, minus the salad. When I asked about the salad, the server looked caught off guard, and it was obvious it was never entered in so, I told him to not to bother...and my burger was wrong. When I brought up what the burger was missing, the server had a rebuttal.  As he began to head to the kitchen to get the missing cheese and onion. I had to ask him to take the plate with him, I didn't want a cold piece of cheese on my burger, I wanted it melted, like how it comes when you order a cheeseburger. By this point I wasn't excited about my dinner anymore. I asked another server to let our server know, that I no longer wanted my burger that I had sent back. Simply because I came to dinner, with my boyfriend, to enjoy the experience together. So, I decided to just help my boyfriend eat his pizza.  The manager came over to deliver the burger. As he kept trying to put it down in front of me, we kept telling him ""no thanks."" He kept persisting it would be it would be free of charge, we said ""no thanks"" again and he just walked away.  That wasn't the point, I would gladly pay full price and I understand mistakes happen but don't make the customer feel like it was their mistake when I in fact placed the order right and half of my meal didn't make it out in the first place!  Moreover, while he was there and as a manager, the least he could have done was offer us a second share plate (since the two of us were eating off one small plate) or a refill on our drinks that were empty and from that point forward we were ignored.  It wasn't until moments later our server finally came back with new refills when we asked for a box and the check. When he brought the check back he finally made mention of this mistake after disappearing for some length of time.  When he dropped the check he offered a free dessert on him. Nice gesture, however, we aren't the type of people that are out for a freebie, if you make a mistake during the course of the meal apologize for it and make it right.  I felt belittled as a customer I asked for my burger to be made right. With the response ""well this is how it's made"" when I asked for it to be modified when I first ordered.

We started with a order of Calamari which for $10 you would expect a bigger portion than what was presented to us but, we overlooked that and continued with our dinner.  My girlfriend ordered the  North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp dinner and I ordered the Garlic Chicken Pesto Tavern-Cut Pizza.  Now this is where the issues started. Our food came out and we began eating.  The Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp dinner my girlfriend ordered came out looking more like a soup.  She kind of gave it a face but didn't want to bother with sending it back so she started eating it.  The Mahi-Mahi was so overcooked it was almost a tough texture to chew and the Shrimp did not taste fresh at all.  Now at this point we decided to flag down the waiter and tell him our issue and return the dish.  The waiter understood took her dish back and let her order another dish (Seared Tuna salad) which she was pleased with when it arrived.  On to my dish, the Garlic Chicken Pesto pizza.  I started eating my first slice, no problem it was great.  Then I got to another slice...there happened to be CELERY on my pizza which totally threw me off mainly because I REALLY don't like celery!  I thought it was a fluke accident but as I examined my pizza more I continued to find more celery on the pizza.  At this point, I really didn't have much of an appetite left anyways so I just let it go.  I did ask the waiter when he came back by if celery should have been on the pizza because the menu didn't state this and he himself looked at the menu and didn't see any mention of the celery.  He did offer to have it remade but, at this point we were done eating and ready to go home.  I boxed up the remainder of the pizza (basically the whole pizza because I only ate two slices) and we paid our tab and left.  He attempted to say the celery was from the Pesto but I knew better than that.  All in all, the staff was great and very accommodating.  The food however this go round...not so great.  I feel like it was a waste of spent money last night for something we didn't really enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=140,2.56,2.92,2.92,2.408,2.7760000000000002

199,Sherrie G.,"Dallas, TX",1,17,,3.0,2016-03-25,"I went here with a singles group on Tuesday. We had reservations for 20 people. I was the host. I was ecstatic at first because a) our table was actually setup and ready when I walked in and b) because they said they'd assigned two waiters to our table. I thought this would be wonderful. That was short-lived however. We had to flag down and beg for every drink we got even though the two waiters were constantly at the register directly behind us. Not once did they bother to lean over or come around to see if we'd like another drink or ask how we were doing. They missed opportunities all over the place as we were all ordering alcoholic beverages and many would have liked dessert menus after the meal. But none of this was offered. We were brought checks without anyone asking if we'd like something else. We felt like we were being dismissed. I could understand if we were a young, rowdy group who was ordering nothing but water and salads. But we were all financially sound, mature individuals ordering full meals and craft cocktails and wine. Why we would be ignored, then dismissed was a mystery to me. It was their loss. And for the record, the food was only average, nothing special in any way. The alcohol was watered (not saying that because of the other problems, but that was my first problem with them).

The atmosphere and decor is what one would expect from any large chain restaurant franchise i.e. Friday's, Chili's, etc. It also hasn't changed in years, so in my eyes it may be time to freshen up the look of the restaurant.  Service was good. Our server was prompt, polite and courteous. Food came out in a reasonable time frame and she was good about checking with us.  The food is where things could use some improvements. We had several of the veggie apps like the portobello mushrooms, artichoke bites, and Brussel sprouts. The artichokes tasted kind of sour and the Brussel sprouts tasted and looked burnt. I had the ribs and they were mediocre. They were dry and tasted and looked like they were sitting under a heat lamp all evening. Wasn't terrible but definitely not amazing either.

After demanding to speak with a manager, they had the audacity to try to give us the food that was STILL SITTING in the warmers. The manager refunded the card and supposedly made us a new order of food, but after getting home, I realize that was not the case. The mozzarella sticks taste like they are under cooked, my salad that I specified ""no onions"" had them on it and my boyfriend's Fish & Chips were soggy. The only thing that was somewhat decent was the Broccoli Cheddar soup, but honestly, who can screw up soup?!? Even though we got a refund, this was an experience that I never want us to go through again. BJ's in Addison, you will never have our business again and definitely ruined our Sunday night after a long day of work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=120,2.72,2.84,3.092,2.02,2.7920000000000003

The new vegan lentil soup was great! Loved it. I ordered it with the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I chose the caesar salad, which wasn't bad.

I went in to buy a gift card.... why during lunch I don't know. :) It took forever because it was lunch time, and there were some new trainees. People were getting upset about the wait time for their pick up food and I was getting a tad frustrated about the wait time to buy a gift card. The manager came out and helped fix everything for everyone. He looked crazy busy and was helping move things along faster and was just so nice! Not just nice because that's what you do...just genuinely a nice guy. I've been out of the service industry for a while now and sometimes I tend to forget just how crazy things can get and what a thankless job it can be... especially during the holidays when people can be even worse for some reason. Thank you manager today! You are awesome. I hope the rest of your day was less crazy and that you get a huge bonus and raise in 2017!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=80,2.68,2.89,3.092,2.58,2.806
11,Pam D.,"Addison, TX",156,619,1091.0,4.0,2016-12-30,"I'm normally not a fan of chain restaurants, but I love coming here. The menu, while extensive, has something for everyone. Even if you're on a diet!  We've never had to wait long for a table and we're usually able to get a booth, which we prefer. If you sign up for their rewards program, you'll get priority on the wait list (if there is one) and the hostess will already know the table style you prefer.  My favorite menu item is their pizza!! I usually get the Sweet Pig (pineapple & ham & tomatoes). When my husband wants pizza too, we're able to get a large and get completely different toppings on each side, which is nice. I also like all of the appetizers I have tried.  We enjoy the variety of beers. The BJ's house beers are fine and relatively inexpensive - I usually order the Hopstorm unless there is an interesting seasonal. We noticed yesterday that you can order beers in pitchers! We have sometimes had issues with servers coming back to get our order for a second round, so a pitcher is a great compromise. Also new is their BJ's app, which basically ensures you talk to as few employees as possible. Fine by me! You can pay your check on the app without requesting it from the server. You can even have your orders for food placed and in their system as soon as you are seated at the table so the kitchen starts preparing them - in case you're really in a hurry.  BJ's also hosts beer dinners, which we haven't been to yet but we plan to go soon.  They have enough TV's to catch a game, but you may want to make sure the host knows what you're trying to watch. The only time I've seen them pipe in sound is for the Cowboys games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.72,2.89,3.092,2.48,2.822

19,Shawn M.,"Abilene, TX",44,18,19.0,4.0,2017-03-18,"BJ's Brewhouse located in Addison, TX is a chain that I would call a mix between Cheesecake Factory and Chili's.  Atmosphere: BJ's has a very well lit, modern space with comfortable seating and a nice layout. We sat on the patio this visit due to having gorgeous 80* weather in the middle of March. The patio has very comfortable seating and plenty of umbrella coverage to keep the sun off our backs. 1 Star Service: We were the first customers to enter the building and the hostess gave us the run of the place. She let us choose wherever we wanted to sit. As mentioned, we opted to enjoy the beautiful weather and eat on the patio. Our waitress promptly came to the table, gave us all menus, took our drink and appetizer orders, and promptly returned. She gave us plenty of leeway to take our time and decipher the vast menu. When we were ready she took our order and quickly refreshed our drinks. Food was out in a jiffy. She was very pleasant and addressed the kids as if they were just as important as we adults. 2 Stars Food: As is typical of a large chain, the food was well thought out and was presented well. All of the sauces/dressings were pretty decent and the food was brought out hot and cooked just the way we ordered it. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich (daughter though it was great, I thought it was acceptable,) a Cobb salad, which my wife thought was quite good, and I ordered from their ""Enlightened Menu."" I chose the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. I ordered them with the greek yogurt crema and the red wine vinaigrette on the side. It arrived exactly how I ordered it. This is one of the freshest dishes I have had at a large chain. The cucumbers were nice and crunchy with juicy diced tomatoes and well seasoned chicken. There was also feta but it was scant. The pita was a bit doughy but still tasted fine. All in all, I give the food 1 star.  ------------------------ My rating system: Up to 1 star for atmosphere (Let's face it, I could eat Franklin BBQ on a dirty napkin while sitting in the bed of my truck.) Up to 2 stars apiece for both food and service (these are the two things that will either drive me away or reel me back in)------------------------ My rating system: Up to 1 star for atmosphere (Let's face it, I could eat Franklin BBQ on a dirty napkin while sitting in the bed of my truck.)

Then waited and waited for another 10-15 mins then Logan ambles back and drops off the drinks and Chips/Salsa. The first thing we noticed was how greasy and oily the chips were. They weren't very nice at all. We gave our main order to Logan and he disappeared for another 20-25mins. Our drinks were empty and I had to ask another server to re-fill the drinks. When my pulled pork sandwich arrived the coleslaw was missing. So Logan says we will make some fresh just for you. I did tell him it was supposed to come with the meal but it seemed I was speaking Japanese. Then eventually the coleslaw arrived but I had already finished my sandwich so we left asap..

Bring out my burger with a bun and with fries. It's like they didn't hear a thing I said. My wife asked for mustard to be brought out with her sliders but noooo!

33,Jt J.,"Irving, TX",21,14,8.0,1.0,2017-09-25,I odered my steak well done.  They burnt the rolls & my steak was way to pink to eat it!  I feel bad for the waiter staff.  They try to do everything right Jeff is great but they get blamed when the food isn't right!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=20,2.56,2.89,2.944,,2.758

29,Shy T.,"Austin, TX",0,169,1.0,3.0,2017-10-08,Went to BJ's after the fair. It was good as usual. We had the avocado egg rolls and the California Cobb flatbread. They never disappoint when it comes to these two dishes. Will definitely be back when in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=20,2.56,2.86,2.94,,2.74
51,Amanda B.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,2.0,2017-10-10,"This was my second time dining at BJ's restaurant. The first time, I dined in the restaurant. They brought my girlfriend the wrong dish. They were were super nice about it, and brought out the correct one within a relatively short period of time. They didn't say anything, but it was deducted off the bill as well. Both meals were delicious. This time we decided to order out. We initially tried to do delivery, or curbside order but it would not take the 20% coupon that was advertised online. We tried calling but were told because it was a third party, they could not help us. I played around with the site a little bit and realized if I did a regular take out order I could go inside to pay.  I had no issues with picking up my order and receiving the discounted price.  Unfortunately, my order was incorrect. I ordered a cheeseburger with chili/tomato/gf bun/medium rare. What I received was a plain bacon cheeseburger, well done and hopefully a gf bun.  I was very disappointed as these burgers are not cheap, especially with the add-ons. It is a huge difference to me between a medium rare burger and a well done burger.  I would be hesitant to order out from BJ's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas?start=40,2.6,2.87,2.94,,2.7620000000000005

I usually just order pizookies because they are BOMB! The monkey bread one... Wow... You just have to try it.  However I tried the gumbo the other day because my friend suggested it to me. It's a huge portion! I shared it with my boyfriend for leftovers the day after. They give a bunch of protein. It's a lot of spices. I wouldn't order again though.  I'll stick to just the pizookies! They're worth it. Sea salt caramel, cookies and cream, monkey bread are my go-tos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.68,2.85,2.94,,2.782

My server was good.(she didn't bring the food out) She informed the manger this is where the ball was dropped! The Manger (Zach) I had to get his name from our server.... Did nothing but gave a Vague Apology (Amateur hour)? didnt comp the meal (Really??????) -Bjs is now dead to me...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.68,2.81,2.936,,2.758
12,Isra A.,"Dallas, TX",0,24,,5.0,2017-11-02,"I came here to redeem my free pizookie offer and had to get it taken out because I was in a hurry. The take out area is seperate which I really like because other restaurant setups can get awkward.  The server quickly took my order without any hassle or attitude. I ordered the oreo one and it was ready to go in 5-7 minutes. I was wary about how they would pack it but it was packaged perfectly and a lot of fun eating outside.  The pizookie was absolutely AMAZING. I get why people rave about them now, and will 100% be going back for more. I was worried that it would be too little but ended up being exactly the right amount.  This place is going to become a regular!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.72,2.81,2.948,,2.774
6,Alex D.,"Dallas, TX",14,134,,3.0,2017-11-03,"Took a co worker here for lunch one day. The place was pretty dead and very quiet. The service was good and we started with the spinach/artichoke dip $10.25 which was pretty good, very cheesy. We split a small BJ's favorite deep dish pizza $16.50. The pizza was just okay, the toppings were good but the crust was not very crunchy or substantial. The sauce was also very plain and flavorless. For a Chicago style pizza I like a thicker sauce and theirs was very thin. They have a gigantic menu so I may go back and try something else but it doesn't bode well for their signature dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.8,2.83,2.948,,2.8179999999999996
7,Autume A.,"Holladay, UT",625,95,46.0,5.0,2017-11-08,Hands down best thing on this menu is the Oreo Pizookie. I can't enough of this dessert. It's a chocolate cookie with a soft center and slightly warm so the vanilla ice cream melts on top. The Oreo Whip Cream is also fantastic. I've also had some of the pizzas and they are great too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,2.92,2.85,2.952,,2.878

I had a gift card that had been given to me as a gift that had not been loaded correctly so it said $0 on it. When this issue was brought to the managers attention, she comped the amount that the gift card was supposed to be for! The waitress was also great.

8,Manuel V.,"Wichita Falls, TX",1,27,97.0,4.0,2017-12-03,"The greeter was good, she informed us we could seat ourselves outside and a waiter would show up. It started off rough as we sit at a dirty table and it took 15 minutes until I  returned to the greeter to get a waiter and someone to bust the table. After returning to my table 5 minutes later it was taken care of. We chose outside as there was a fire and heated canopy's for outdoor seating. Shortly after the waiter AJ arrived, placed our order and this is where the night progressed and was worth the hassle of waiting. If BJ's reads this they should really give the MAN a RAISE or PROMOTION due to his attentiveness and ability to give every table he had the best Customer Service one would expect. If it wasn't for AJ this would had gone in such a different way and AJ THANK YOU for your Service for doing a Job that others would had given less than half the effort you gave. Our orders were the Tomato & Basil pizza as well as 2 of the Pepperoni Pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,3.0,2.89,2.972,,2.934
0,Brennan M.,"Spring, TX",1,85,29.0,5.0,2017-12-13,"Although BJ's is known for their pizza and pizookies, the hamburger is the all-star MVP here. This may be me being biased because I'm a burger guy, but these are usually cooked to perfection (and order) and topped with a fluffy white cloud of a bun to complete the ensemble. The sidekick? Sweet potato fries. What else? Well, to be fair, they recently added those when they booted wedge fries off the menu. Their house-brewed craft beer is on point, but no one will blame you if you order an ice cold glass and a bottle of Michelob Ultra because that beer is a burger's best friend. And if alcohol isn't on your list, they have Diet Pepsi which the only diet soda you should drink because it's Aspartame free.  All the food is good though. The staff is almost always nice. The place is always clean. Just go eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,3.16,2.92,2.976,,3.0160000000000005
1,Chef C.,"Irving, TX",0,26,8.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"We only visit BJ's once a year, for a yearly holiday get together. But each time the restaurant is beautiful, the food is great, and the staff is always friendly.  This year the staff was super accommodating with us and our guests. They let us set up early, and decorate our seating area before our guests arrived, and they gave us a nice area away from everyone in the main dining hall, which always makes us feel special.  However, despite the food being great, and everything else being five star, on this last visit I had to use the restroom and my goodness was I shocked! The restroom was not clean! In fact it looked forgotten. You can always judge a restaurant 's dedication to cleanliness based on the restroom and after stepping inside the restroom I'm not sure I want to come back, truthfully. Two of the toilets were broken! I'm talking about that flush handle being completely lopsided and questionable looking. Like, ""Ooh, is that a splash zone risk?"" Yeah. It was crooked and janky. Flat out busted looking. This meant there was only one loo for all the women (I'm sure staff included) to utilize! How in the world is a business to function with only one available loo for the female guests and employees to use!? And, folks this is a HUGE restaurant. This isn't some mom and pop small restaurant. This is a chain!!! I would have told the staff, but there wasn't anyone around the restroom. So what do I do? I flat out refused to ""use it"" and sat back down with my family and friends. But, I must be honest, after coming back to the dinner table I simply forgot to tell our waitress about it. We were eating anyway, I didn't want to disgust anyone.  Well BJ's you may have delicious food, but your bathroom's are atrocious. I'll be rethinking our holiday party plans as well.  There's no excuse for an unsightly bathroom in a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dallas,3.04,2.92,2.976,,2.9680000000000004
