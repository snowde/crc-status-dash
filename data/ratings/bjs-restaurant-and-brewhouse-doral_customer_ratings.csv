216,Karolyn M.,"Miami, FL",37,28,186.0,5.0,2012-10-24,My new favorite spot for a comfy atmosphere close to my home with delicious pizza and crafted beers. Been here twice in one week.

218,Matthew O.,"Bryce, UT",30,265,11.0,3.0,2012-10-27,"We decided to give BJ's a try after reading a couple Yelp! reviews from some of the other locations.  We went to this location early Saturday afternoon.  The servers and hostess were very nice and professional acting.  They seated next to a large group in an otherwise empty restaurant.  The hostess seemed a little surprised when my wife asked to sit elsewhere.  A few minutes later she seated a family with screaming kids near us.  I hate that.  Oh well, on to the food.   If Pizza Hut, The Cheesecake Factory and Gordon Biersch had a baby together, it would be BJ's. We ordered the avocado eggroll thing and was very happy with it.  My wife ordered some sort of fish tacos and seemed pleased with her choice.  I ordered a deep dish pizza and was fairly happy with it. Although, it tasted exactly like a pizza from Pizza Hut.  Good thing I like Pizza Hut.   Aside from having to listen to someones screaming kids, I enjoyed BJ's.  But, I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-doral?start=200,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002

Jenner the bartender took care of us and I must say I was thoroughly impressed by his overall knowledge of the menu. He recommended the pumpkin ale beer which was amazing. We shared an Avocado egg roll appetizer which was mouthwatering and went great with my beer! Overall We loved BJ's and will definitely come back for more!

The beer selections were great, I ordered the sampler which brings I believe 8, they were perfectly cold and tasty (I know, girls describe beer tasty lol). My waiter was very friendly and very open with suggestions, I will definitely go back, maybe to their new location located at the Falls Shopping center....

I mean, it's a brewery--but it's a CHAIN.  Like, corporate, like run by The Man.  But I will say this new (summer 2012) addition to Doral is not too shabby.  Sure, some of the beer stands out (the Belgian-style Camaraderie) while other plays back-up (the ho-hum pils), but none of the food I have ordered disappointed me.  And they have a great patio.  And Doral has a major MAJOR shortage of decent patio dining.

For entrees, we were so full that we decided to share the bacon cheeseburger. Needless to say, we were stuffed to the gills.

I had the white chocolate one and it was great. We actually ordered the sample one which came with three different pizookie's which was perfect for our party since there was three of us. I tried both other pizookie's (red velvet & chocolate) and both were good as well.   ~As for drinks... I wasn't going to come to a brewhouse and not try their beers. I like light, refreshing beers (i.e. corona, sea dog, miller, dos equis, etc) so I asked the server which one of their signature BJ's beers she recommended me to try. She recommended the LightSwitch Lager,Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, and the BJ's Jeremiah Red. For me, the winner was the Red and coming up to close second was the LightSwitch Lager! Suprisingly tasty beers at a reasonable price (btw...we had gone for happy hour). ~My friend had a mojito and she said she really liked it.  ~The appearance of the restaurant is welcoming.

Went to this location not to long ago hoping to get another glass of their seasonal Grand Cru. Unfortunately this location stopped selling it, but I know other ones up north still are so I'm not sure why this one stopped early. If you do end up in a location that is still selling it, try it! It's a delicious 10% APV Belgian beer. The food here is fine, nothing spectacular but satisfying. I had the buffalo chicken wontons at the N. Fl location and they were just okay, but their watermelon salad was very good, but I wish they'd put just a bit more watermelon in it. I tried some of my bf's pizza with bacon and chicken and it was actually pretty yummy.

We were seated in 5 minutes as promised but then waited close to 20 minutes for one of the many members of staff and managers that walked passed us to acknowledge our existence. We ordered a soda, iced tea, beer and our food. Our salads came out first then the two soft drinks finally my beer when the salads were finished. When our mains came one dish that had chicken in it came with no chicken until we asked. The deep dish pizza I had, tasted worse than a Pizza Hut pizza, which is pretty sad. I really had my hopes up for the pizza. The sausage was cheap and so was their ""5 cheese"" blend. The crust was also really soggy and not crunchy as it should be. When we were only half way done with our food we were asked if we want dessert. We said no and I ordered another beer. A while later our check arrived at the table and then my second beer.

Service was EXTREMELY slow. -My husband order a salad which arrived to the table 20 mins after  the other meals (yes, salad took longer than steak). -My friend requested A1 sauce, took about 10 minutes to get it, once it arrived, food was already cold.  I spoke to the manager and while apologetic, he didn't really asked me what I though would be a good solution, instead he began ""comping"" things for my friends (for my husbands inconvenience).  My husband and I had separated our checks from the rest of the table so it really was not helpful for him to solve our issue by discounting things from the overall bill. I had to walk the manager through the reason why him comping my friend's appetizer was not going to help. At the end my husband and I were relieved from paying for our meals (his salad was packed to go) and I was not charged for my sandwich ($12 value).   -We ordered dessert and it took about 25 minutes for it to be served (the discussion with the manager about poor service had passed, you would think they would step it up but no).

By far the best is the Amber ale, the IPA was too weak and the pilsner might as well have been water. I had a sample of the beers for less than $7, which was nice but I have to say the Titanic on US 1 brews better beer. This BJ establishment is fairly new and the inside is nicely decorated and has a good flow/setup. I ordered the sliders which were ok....nothing to rave about. I had the potato skins which were definitely worth going for. It is so hard to find good potato skins in Miami. Crunchy but not burnt, cheesy with copious amounts of bacon. Perfection for me.

Their was a mishap with our tomato soup; they gave our soups to another table and we didn't get them till' after our salad so our waiter charged us the soups as small but gave us the large ones. On another point, i like that the manager came around each table to make sure everyone was ok with their order.

It took 20 minutes just to get silver wear after the salad arrived; which we were unable to eat until we had forks. Then they forgot the rest of our food, which were only appetizers for their happy hour special. 45 minutes later they send our appetizers to the wrong table, then they take it back after the wrong table touches it and try and serve it to us. We were appalled. After speaking with the manager he apologizes and proceeds to make us new appetizers which still get taken to the wrong table. Complete incompetence working at this restaurant. Finally we get our food after over an hour and only get a half off discount. Don't recommend it because of the service and wont come again.

All of those aspects were excellent. I had a great time watching The Heat/Jazz game and later the Ravens/Lions game... no need to look around for which TV is playing your game, squint to read the score, or sit uncomfortably like you sometimes have to do at Flanagan's or the Ale House.

However, because I don't have to do that I can continue onward!  BJ's food is just alright. I've eaten here about 10 times, and each time the food is always good but not great. It's always good enough to not make you regret having to come back when a friend wants to go here (unlike Chili's which is always terrible). I've had pastas, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and pretty much whatever else they have. You will try in vain to find something that is exciting to eat and you will fail. BJ's has two things on every other chain restaurant: They brew their own beer (in addition to the normal stuff on tap) and they have a massive TV screen behind the bar that you can pretty much see from everywhere in the restaurant. The massive TV screen is great for watching games, and they can even break down different games into different sections of the TV. Every bar that can afford it should have one. The beers on the other hand are much like the food in that they are perfectly okay, but they just make you want something better. The service at BJ's will of course vary wildly since they have so many employees although whenever my friend wasn't my waiter, the service has been kind of terrible. The happy hour specials they have are also pretty good because they include alcohol AND food and they're during the early afternoon and past 10PM.  All in all, it's just an okay place. You'll probably eat here because you're at International Mall for some reason or around the area and you will argue with whoever you're with about what to eat and then before you know it, you're seated at a BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-doral?start=180,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.9560000000000004,2.68

My friends and I say outside for about 10 min until we were called in, then lead to our table by some other girl.  We say down and started looking thru the menu, I had been there a couple times before so I knew kinda what I wanted. Out waiter came by after around 5 min and took our drink order. Everything seemed to be going pretty good... We he brings our drinks, I ordered a cream soda. It was good, but it had no ice. Don't get my wrong, the soda wasn't hot...but it wasn't cold either. A little ice would have  been nice. But whatever, no biggie for me.  He then took our orders. Both my friends that I was with are vegetarians, but I'm not. So I got a chicken with mash potatoes and broccoli. My other friend got mac and cheese (she asked for no bacon) and the other girl got the mushrooms.  About 45 min later our good comes. It felt a lot longer then it really was...I still think 45 min is a lot to wait but whatever. At least the food is finally here. As soon as he set my friends plate down with her mac and cheese, she notices it has bacon on it, and just tells the guy if he could get her another one with no bacon. It's cool, the guy takes it back. As she's waiting for herac and cheese I start eating my chicken. It's pretty good. Then I go to eat my broccoli, and my fork wouldn't pierce through it. Weird. I tried again and it was super hard. Upon further inspection.... I got raw broccoli.  Seriously.  Like it still had that white residue on it, shows that it hadn't even been rinsed or anything.  They bring my friends mac and cheese back, still had bacon. We let them know about my broccoli situation and they said they were gonna give me another side. Never came. We asked to speak with a manager. He didn't speak much English, but explain that my friends mac and cheese was delivered to the wrong table (three times?) and that he was sorry about my broccoli. They never brought the extra side. The only person that ended up eating was my friend with the mushrooms.  It saddens me because this place has so much potential, but the service is so bad. Like I said, I been there many times before, but stopped going because of the service. I won't be going back here ever again, maybe to another BJs location, but never back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-doral?start=240,3.12,2.66,2.66,2.5320000000000005,2.8440000000000003

When we arrived we noticed everything was clean and the restaurant itself looked nice. Our wait to be seated was about 10-15 minutes. When we sat, we ordered the chicken won-ton and caprese salad as appetizers. The won-tons were delicious, the caprice salad was ok, For entrees we ordered a pepperoni pizza, it was very thick and the flavor? Great. We also ordered the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye 14 oz with mash potatoes. 14oz? More like 6oz, or at least that is what it seemed like. The mash potatoes were delicious, we actually ordered more. The waitress was ok, she took our order pretty fast, but we had to wait about 30 minutes for our food. We then ordered our desserts and this is what really took our time, we ordered the pizookie trio because we wanted to have a taste of different desserts, (White Chocolate Macadamia Nut,  Cookies 'n' Cream, Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli) after the 30-40 minute wait, our order came, and it came wrong, we were given two white chocolate macadamia nut, and one no cookies 'n' cream, no triple chocolate made with ghirardelli, we informed the waitress, and she brought out the correct one, and let us keep the wrong item at no additional charge (30 minutes later) At this point, we just asked for our check, because we were going to be late to our movie.

145,Jonathan C.,"Houston, TX",26,46,21.0,4.0,2015-02-05,"This is by far the best BJ's I've visited from the choices available in South Florida. There's plenty of parking, friendly staff, and ample seating inside.  My last visit there was for my best friend's birthday celebration. Our hostess was very friendly about informing us with the wait time for a table for 10 people, and we took all of 15 minutes patiently waiting for a large enough section to free up for us to sit at.  I won't go through what everyone ordered, and will instead explain what I got. I first ordered the ""Drink Like That"", which was voted most favorite for that particular restaurant. It was very yummy at first. However, when I took a sip after tasting the calami I ordered as an app, the aftertaste made me think of play-dough - it had the same exact taste, and was also kind of slimy when drinking it with food.  After not touching my drink, the waitress asked me if there was something wrong with it, which surprised me since she was serving a rather large group of people. She very quickly replaced my drink with some sweet tea, which helped get rid of the play-dough aftertaste.  My food was great, on the other hand. I ordered the rib-eye prepared medium-rare, and it came out delicious and flavorful. I'm very glad I went with it. Everyone else was very happy with their orders as well. All in all, we had a great experience and our waitress was amazing! The reason this review didn't get 5 stars is mostly because there lacked a certain exceptional quality to the food and atmosphere. Everything was great, but it didn't quite add up to five stars.

The salads and pizzas are really great crowd pleasers and the chicken marsala is super tasty!  As for the beers, the Jeremiah Red and Amber Ale are full-bodied and go with a variety of foods. The Hefeweizzen is fruity and has a delicate wheat flavor bringing up the rear. They also have a full bar and most major beer labels in bottles.  They also have a menu that can please just about everyone. Even their lighter options are full of flavor and always very satisfying. The mahi mahi is my favorite when I feel like I should save my calories for a pizookie (I'll get to that later). The fish is firm and served on a bed of sauteed rice and crisp vegetables. All of it is topped with a sweet and tangy sauce that provides the right balance of flavors.  On this occasion I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and was not impressed. It was flavorless, cold in the middle, and made with so much cream cheese that our chips would break when trying to scoop some out, I would not order this appetizer again.  For my entree I got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken was topped with a lemon butter sauce, perfectly pan-fried, and juicy.  The kitchen is very fond of their cream cheese as I believe that a fair bit of it is in their mashed potatoes. They are a bit heavy, but this is how my mama makes them and so I really like it :)  The broccoli is only lightly steamed and seasoned. Definitely needs a dip in the lemon butter sauce for added flavor.  I tried the ahi tuna salad and thought that it had a perfect ratio of dressing to vegetable. The tuna was just seared and very fresh. Watch out for the little mounds of wasabi on the side of the plate, but otherwise a very refreshing and filling salad. For the piece de resistance we got a salted caramel pizookie. It looks like an over-sized easy bake oven cookie but it is full of hot gooey, buttery, nutty cookie. Topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, salted caramel sauce, and chocolate chips, the cookie was inhaled within minutes. Though this one is good, my favorite is still the peanut butter.

The manager came up and kindly offered to take our beverage and appetizer orders. The waiter (Wess/Ress?) came later to give us our drinks. We ordered the fire-roasted salsa with tortilla chips. It is not fire-roasted salsa. The salsa is COLD. We also got the crispy calamari, it toke 30 minutes to get, but came out okay. The breading fell off a bit while dipping it into the sauce and breading was overly soaked in oil. Around 7:15pm more lighting was turned on. I got the Cajun Pasta. The sauce was like a blend of red spaghetti tomato sauce and Alfredo sauce, which I found to be sour. The two pieces of garlic bread that came with the pasta was amazing. Crispy, buttery, and well seasoned, I loved the taste of it. The chicken was really chewy, seemed to be over cooked, I could see some parts were burnt. When we asked for the check, it toke over 15 minutes for the waiter to come back with our check. The waiter wasn't around for another 10 minutes to pick up the check and another 10 to come back with the credit card and receipt.

They have the possibilities to dish out great food, customer service and drinks, however, they don't push to reach their potential. I went with my boyfriend for our lunch break and while we were happy to get in and out in an hour, the service was rather mediocre and the food was as well. We started off with the guac and chips which were good, the guac is definitely fresh and chips are chips - can't complain there. However, the guac has pretty big pieces of jalapeños, which was an unpleasant surprise for me, so beware! For our entree, we ordered the Mahi Tacos, which are really good! We also ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Broccolli. Avoid it. The alfredo sauce is tasteless, the chicken is bland and the pasta was too tough. Not at all recommended. Considering it was lunch hour and they were fairly empty, our server was less than attentive. We even had to ask another server for our bill after waiting for 15 minutes (which you don't want to do when you're taking a 1HR lunch break from work.)

Nonetheless, I really appreciate the fact that someone from the kitchen staff came to apologize for the inconvenience. Our server paid very little attention to our table, never offered a refill and I had to call him to ask for a second beer, since he didn't approach our table . After we finished with our meals (I should say after I finished with my meal, since my wife's appetite went away after waiting so long and ended up taking hers to go), we were ready to order desserts, however we were waiting for about 20 minutes for our server to come to our table (during this time my wife went to the car to picked up the diaper bag, changed our daughter and came back to the table) , when the server finally came to our table, after chitchatting with his co-workers we decided not to order any dessert as we were very frustrated with this experience. Finally, we did tip our server the 15% they suggest, not that he deserved it after the type of service he provided us; however in my opinion this is something that can be avoided and changed with the right management, supervision and better training.

I have been wanting to come back here for a while so we decided to come dine Saturday night. I left with mix feelings. First the positives: I really like the fact that you can do call ahead seating. You could even order ahead! Once we arrived we were seated right away. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was delicious! We ordered the fried calamari and the baked avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls won my vote! They come with a soy sauce but taste much better with ranch. For our entree my husband ordered the full rack of ribs. The meat fell right off the bones! He loved it! I ordered their Gourmet five meat deep dish pizza. It was soooo good! I ordered the small size which was more than enough. I shared and even left a slice. Four our daughter we ordered the chicken tenders with fries. I feel like it was a very good portion for children and it was not expensive. She enjoyed it. For dessert I ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with Ghirardelli. OMG... absolutely mouth watering! A must try!  Now for the negatives:  The service was not so great. We arrived at 8:30pm and left at 10:30pm. Not by choice. The service was very very slow. It took the waiter over 15 mins just to bring drinks to the table. Once he brought them he quickly disappeared again. We waited another 15 mins for him to show up to order appetizers and our dinner. That's just 30 mins in waiting for drinks and to order food. Not off to a good start. The appetizers came in like 20 mins then we waited another 20 mins for the food. The worst part was the wait for the dessert. 30 mins. I was about to pay and leave. Glad I didn't though because it was delicious! Once the dessert came he didn't even give my husband a chance to speak. He left and came back in 15 mins. Well he really didn't come back my husband had to hunt him down just to receive the check. The food is pretty pricey. So I expected better service for what I was paying for.  If it weren't for how good the food & drinks were this place would have received 1 star.

90,Nikki A.,"Miami, FL",10,4,,1.0,2017-06-08,"My experience at BJs today was unbelievable. I am a regular customer and what happened to me today (and to many others I'm sure) is ridiculous. I ordered my lunch between 10:45AM and 11AM to pick up at 12PM. I arrive on time, and there is no one ""available"" to assist me. There were three young ladies gossiping at the hostess area, and none of them even attempted to ask if I needed help. There was a gentleman that looked like he was off the clock that headed towards the back to tell someone I was waiting. I waited about 5 minutes, but keep in mind that I'm on my lunch break .. every minute counts especially since I have to drive to pick it up. She approaches me giggling, and tells me "" we have no wifi."" I look at her confused, asked her what does that have to do with my order ? She told me that they will not receive any orders online and that my order technically was never placed. This young lady didn't even offer me a solution or even apologize for the inconvenience. I received a confirmation notice, but if the location wasn't accepting orders there should've been a message on the website. I wasted 30 minutes of my break going to this restaurant to not EVEN EAT. My break is only an hour and I had to figure out what to eat with the time I had left. I am furious with the unprofessionalism that was displayed at this location.

40,Samuel H.,"Riviera Beach, FL",1,25,11.0,4.0,2017-06-25,"So we come here usually every week and sometimes twice a week. It's a great place, awesome food, decent prices and great service. Unfortunately today the hostess completely blew it. We told her party of 7, six adults with one child. She put us in a six-person booth. With 7 people. Her explanation was she would put the extra chair at the end of the table. Let me just add something here guys: it was 1145am in a nearly empty restaurant. So now we have six of us cramped into a booth, and one adult at the end of the table in a chair because the child sits between mom & dad. I love this restaurant, but the inexperience and lack of training of this hostess just made this a waste of my time. Please correct it. The hostess either needs to ask if a six-person booth is ok for 7 people or make a better decision to put a 7-person party at a larger booth/table.

My New Orleans Jambalaya came with all the Cajun Spice hauled off to one side of the plate, making it not very spicy, but I was okay with it. My step-dad's Pork Chop was probably cooked at super high heat because the exterior was charred and the inside was white and dry. And it's not cool to hide Wasabi in the middle of my mom's Tuna Salad. The Trio Wookie for dessert was the best part of the night, but I got a really full-feeling after I devoured those.

The waiters at this branch have been nothing short of kind and knowledgable.  For appetizers I've ordered Avocado Egg Rolls and Mozzarella sticks. The Avocado egg rolls are something you don't want to miss out on. I think those were the best Avocado egg rolls I have ever eaten, the roll itself is very meaty and tastes amazing.  Recently, I have discovered my all time favorite entree to get at this restaurant. The crispy Jalapeño burger but instead of meat I substituted it with a salmon fillet. It was so delicious.

Last two times i went my experience was not pleasant.  Lunch- the server was completely missing. i mean what was supposed to be a 30 min lunch turned into an hour because we had no idea where the heck he kept going? we asked him for napkins and they never came so we asked some one else for napkins after waiting about 15 min and the napkins were right behind our booth? The food i ordered looked ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like it did on the menu, in the menu it was a quinoa bowl and the bowl was full, i got half my plate full and the food didn't even look appetizing in the least way. Given that i had been here a few times before i didn't think to write a review because i know they have done better and decided to let it slide.  But then we came again... We got there at about 11pm to have their dessert... we walk in and there was no hostess.. we were there for so long that a line started to form behind us ... eventually about 10-15 min later a lady comes out and starts seating people. We get sat and no one comes to greet us... we just started talking to ourselves and eventually the waitress showed up , we placed our order and we were left alone until we were done with our dessert, then came the game of trying to find the waitress to get the check. Something that should have been a maybe 30 min experience turned into over AN HOUR (not exaggerating because we looked at the time when we got there to make sure they were still open) so i guess my suggestion for this place is to do take out ? i tried lunch and dessert and i was unfortunately not impressed. i don't know what has changed because like i said we have gone previously and never had a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-doral,3.28,3.47,3.224,,3.394

The place is nice, a little dark and the menu is pretty huge.  I tried the California chicken club which was very yummy and then I got the mahi mahi and shrimp which was horrible to me. It was over cooked and it came with a weird broth which is the sautéed for the shrimp that I did not like. The service was okay, I felt the waitress was either stressed, annoyed or it was just a bad day for her.

Maybe he's blind and can't see that I'm on the phone but whatever. I pointed the phone out to him and he rolled his eyes and walked away shaking his head.

The first time we came it was busy, we had ordered an appetizer that never came and was part of the bill. Got a dirty wine glass that took forever to change- my partner ended up drinking all their wine before I even had a sip. Second time- went with a group and it was a slow weeknight, three entrees delayed due to the waiter's mistake. We were told that our food would be out in ""5 min tops"". It came out 25 min later when most of the group was ready to go, so we sent the food back. To add insult to injury, our bill which had the subtraction of the sent back food, had an addition of an entree no one had ordered- when asked the waiter told us ""oh the manager forgot to take that off""- but no one had remotely had anything similar to the item. Drink service slow, paying the bill is slow.

Not really, but let me say that they do have some awesome, delicious brews out here! My favorite is the award winning Jeremiah Red!
