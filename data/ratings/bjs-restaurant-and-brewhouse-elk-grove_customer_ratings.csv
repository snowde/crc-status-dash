They called at 6:50 ish to see if we were still gonna make it and we said we were here. When we got to the front desk, she said itd be a 30-45 minute wait.  I stand before you yelpers now, waiting at 46 min and guess what?? MY BUTT IS STILL ON THE WAITING BENCH!  What's the point of calling in to make a reservation?? OH. and people who don't have reservations have been getting in before us.  I JUST talked to them and now I have to wait 5 more minutes.  A wait this long for low quality food?? It isn't even worth it. Even the crappy McDonalds across the street is looking more appealing than this. And I won't need a reservation there!

722,Faye V.,"San Francisco, CA",47,59,52.0,4.0,2012-01-10,"My restaurant nightmare is sending food back to the kitchen. True story. I am extremely afraid of getting pubic-hair-pizza or spit-back-spaghetti. I have never ever returned food to the kitchen - no matter how badly -- at least until we were served an overcooked steak at BJ's. The twist? It was because of this overcooked steak that BJ's at Elk Grove made me a fan. It was actually my mother's order. The scene: It's the week before Christmas, we hit up BJ's after a shopping marathon, all starved. Drinks and appetizers came, followed by the main dishes. Everyone dove into their plates like vultures. But, as famished as mamskii was, she wasn't touching it.  She was so turned off, she just pushed her plate aside. Luckily for us, the server noticed her dissatisfaction and was extremely kind about everything. Furthermore, the manager himself came over to remedy the situation. Within 20 minutes, a brand new steak arrived, cooked perfectly at medium well - served with a baked potato and all the fixings. Their overall method of the handling everything impressed us all. The staff was very courteous and the manager's extra effort did not go unnoticed. Although it was my nightmare come true, my fears waned - a little. We've eaten here before and everything has always been a-okay. The food is decent, the servers efficient and the atmosphere perfect for a group of 10 equipped with two toddlers and a man-child. Our cups never went empty, our meals always served timely. Most importantly, because it's a chain, the menu is reliable. Spit-back spaghetti is still a fear - regardless of where I eat. However, if you want a laid back joint to enjoy a few beers with friends or have dinner with the family, BJ's at Elk Grove is a good option. Our fave appetizers are the wings, nachos, calamari and bruschetta. The pizza and pastas have never gone wrong and the fish dishes are a nice surprise. If you have room for dessert - that pizookie is pretty darn delish. I believe that others may not have gotten the same service - but I'm glad we've been lucky. It's one of my brother-in-law's faves and we'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=660,3.04,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0880000000000005

870,Mai N.,"Elk Grove, CA",86,39,8.0,5.0,2012-02-23,"Wahoo!!! This place is awesome! There isn't many brewery places to go to in elk grove with decent food.  Happy hours!!!!! You give this place got 3 stars average but you know you come back here all the time for happy hours. I always go here for happy hours and on the weekends for there drinks. Happy hours are from 3-7PM and 10 to closing, on weekdays. I believe its a dollar off cocktails/drafts, 2 dollars off appetizers, and half off on their mini pizzas. Man that's is a deal. Why? Because that the only thing that's it good here...Appetizers, pizzas and drinks. You can only get happy hours special inside the bar area. It's first come first serve and you seat yourself. Its pretty big. I never had to wait for too long for a table.  Appetizers: I had almost all the appetizers. My two favorite and must get appetizers are going to be the chicken lettuce wraps and the Santa Fe spring rolls. YUMMM.  The chicken lettuce wraps comes with 6 cabbage leafs, a bowl of chicken mixed with seasoning and other veggies, and two yummy sauce (I believe it's housin sauce mix and the other is wasabi cream). There so much flavors going on and I absolutely love it. You feel good eating it too because it seem like a very health dish. OhhhhMG the Santa Fe Spring rolls is stuff with avocados, cream cheese, and other garnishes, all wrapped in a wonton wrap and deep fried. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It comes with two dipping sauce but I only use the guacamole dip. Next on my must get list would be the chicken wings. Its deep fried a toss in their sauce and drizzled with ranch and hot sauce. I usually ask for the sauce on the side because I like my wing crunchy. The wings are nice and juicy and the sauce makes the everything comes together. I usually don't eat flat bread; I like my pizza fluffy. I had flat bread pizzas once here and once at Bistro 33 in Davis; BJs' is definitely better than Bistro. Everything else is pretty decent nothing to rave about but nothing to hate on either.  The only one I wouldn't recommend is probably the calamari...no good =[ just stay away from.  Pizza: The pizza crust and dough part is really fluffy, just how I like it. Beside that nothing much of different then other places. I'm not much of a pizza fan but something about half off makes everything taste better. That's a deal. You can get full off a 4 dollar pizza. They have lots of options. My favorite is the great white. Great Alfredo sauce on a pizza...YUMMY! They're not shady with their toppings either and that is always a plus. I use to order other stuff here like pasta or even there sandwiches during the lunch special but I don't think it's worth it. I am not saying it not good; I am just saying that I can something better for cheaper elsewhere.    Drinks: This is probably the best place in Elk Grove to get drinks, chill, and have a good chat with friends and family. Drinks here are ...well the best in elk grove. They have a huge cocktail list and my favorite are the mojitos. That is my favorite drink in general but bj's makes it the best. My sister usually goes for the martinis and I feel like their martinis are really strong because she always get buzz after a drink (that usually doesn't happen). They either have really strong alcohol or they are not shady about it. They have a huge selection on draft. I am not much of a beer person, but they have the beer sampler, which give you about 1.5 pint (i think) of all there beers that the make themselves. That's 8 different beers and my brother had that for his birthday and couldn't even finish it (he is a heavy drinker).  I usually don't have problem with service here. They're all nice people. Come to check on you, refill drinks, ask us if we want anything before they give us the check ... you know all the typical stuff. Sometime they can be a little slow though. When it get busy the food takes forever to come out but its a restaurant, what can you expect.  Last thing! THEIR PIZOOKIES ARE HELLLLLLLLLA BOMB!! I usually only get the original chocolate chip and vanilla bean. Its so good. The cookie is nice soft and warm, while the ice cream is creamy and cold. All together, it's like heaven in my mouth!! And you get it for free if it's your birthday! YAYYYY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=740,3.28,3.14,3.14,2.9960000000000004,3.1960000000000006

Fair enough, it was a saturday night. The girl at the front desk was hardly friendly though. The food was good enough to get me to come back and try it again. I went back less than a week later to have the fish and chips . This time it was a weeknight, and somehow even though the restaurant wasn't packed like it was the on the weekend, there were plenty of problems. We weren't greeted by the girl at the front desk (a different girl from the other night) for about two minutes, while we stood there waiting. It took another few minutes after she finally acknowledge us, to be seated. She was running around trying to find seats and seating others. She told us that they only had one busser on. After we ordered and our appetizers arrived, we realized that they hand't given us silverware or napkins. So we waited for a good 5 minutes before we could get the attention of our server and ask for silverware/napkins, while our food was sitting there getting cold. Our server was not the problem. She was obviously overwhelmed and did her best to give us good service. It appeared like the place was understaffed. There was however more than one busser on, despite what we were told and you could see other tables getting impatient as well, stopping the bussers for help, for their checks, etc. The table behind us couldn't find their server either. I can say that the fish and chips, stuffed mushrooms, and crispy won tons were all very tasty.

My friends and I are always coming here for drinks and food.  Very chill atmosphere and the food is good. Since this is a brewery, they have a variety of house brewed beers and mixes to choose from.  One of my favorites is called a Jerry Burst which is a mixture of their Jeremiah Red and Berry Burst Cider.  Sweet, light, and fruity.  As for food, the best items to order during happy hour are their personal sized pizzas because it's 50% off.  The regulars that I order are the BBQ Chicken and the Great White pizza.  For appetizer, my all time favorite item is the Chicken lettuce wraps. It's a must try! Don't forget to try a pizookie! (you get one free on your birthday!)

373,r l.,"Lodi, CA",36,589,33965.0,4.0,2012-05-31,"Yesterday... on a Bike Ride to the Elk Grove area... After arriving within the City Limits of Elk Grove by Bicycle yesterday, I was salivating over the thought of a Guiness Float which I had last month at a drinking establishment in downtown Sacramento... which satisfied my craving for Ice Cream and Alcohol and was absolutely refreshing. I worked my way West-ward on Elk Grove Boulevard stopping at almost every drinking establishment looking for a place that served Root Beer Floats... knowing that finding a place that served Guiness Floats would probably be fruitless. I went through countess restaurants perusing their Menus till I happened on BJs on Laguna... read their framed menu posted at the entrance... Voila! There it is... a ""BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer Float"" !!! On the menu... Custom-made Guiness Float (**** 1/2 $6.75) (   ) Now... this is why I chose BJs over any other drinking establishment in Elk Grove! I took a seat at the Bar knowing that I had to have a ""personal"" relationship with the Bar-tender. I described the Guiness Float I had a month ago... Two Scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream dropped into some Guiness and then some Guiness to top it off... ""Can you do it?"" The Bartender replied... ""I'll do my best..."". When the Bartender returned with his concoction... I have to say... BJs is great on presentation... even with an improvised on-the-spot Dessert / Drink. The Pint Glass was literally frothing over the sides of the glass, with wisps of vapor emanating from the sides and the top of the Dessert... reminiscent of something made by a mad-scientist in a Horror Flick! And the Dessert Drink really hit the spot... especially on a very Hot Bicycle Ride yesterday! If there was any criticism though... it would be some experimentation... I requested two scoops of Ice Cream... for those with sweeter taste buds, it'd be best to ask for three. And the Ice Cream at BJs is of the soft type - more like a soft-serve rather than the frozen type. Maybe a request to place the scoops of Ice Cream in the freezer then to make the Float at the end of your meal might be preferable.  Stayed for some... Wyder's Pear Cider (***** $6.95) (   ) Prefer Cider over Beer... anytime, any day of the week. Other options were a Berry Cider or a Belgian Framboise (Beer)... Question to BJs... What about Apple Cider? A visiting Englishman wouldn't recognize the Ciders at BJs... Black & Bleu Burger (** 1/2 $10.25) (   ) (   ) (   ) Blackened half-pound Angus pattie with a melted, creamy Bleu Cheese topping, with Applewood smoked Bacon, roasted Garlic Aioli and Tomatoes between some toasted and Buttered Artisan Hamburger Buns... with a side of seasoned Wedge-Cut Fries.  Between the Blackened Hamburger Pattie and the Bleu Cheese... you would think this would be... ""One Tasty Burger!"" . Nope. Despite the handsome presentation of the entree... 1) the toated and buttered Hamburger Buns were rather Dry, very Dry... on the verge of imminent staleness. 2) BJs has to learn how to Blacken meat... when you Blacken anything, there is a degree of Saltiness... and this Hamburger just lacked that flavor. 3) Bleu Cheese lacked sharpness and flavor... it might as well been any kind of Cheese other then Bleu. 4) Wedge Fries... count em... only about a dozen wedges or so. Such stinginess at BJs... Seansoned? With what?  After the meal, asked the Bartender how much would it cost to upgrade a Burger at BJs to a 1-Pounder... $3.99 for an extra Hamburger Pattie... Hmm... Looks like I won't be having any 1-Pound Burgers at BJs anytime soon.... I could direct you to my favorite place to get a Black & Bleu... but then you'd accuse me of just being a promoter... From the Greeter at the entrance of BJs to the Bartender, who obligingly listened to me and concocted my Guiness Float... the people at BJs are some of the nicest and cordial service people I've met at a restaurant. On the verge of being syrupy nice... seemingly cultishly nice - too good to be true. Maybe I'll ask for a Cider Float next time at my local BJs... After this Brunch / Lunch yesterday... between the Guiness Float and the Pear Cider I had a buzz leaving the restaurant... I could not work off the buzz until after ten miles of Bike Riding during the ride back to Lodi. Made it back, though, as you can see...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=400,3.2,3.18,3.18,2.8640000000000003,3.1880000000000006

We told her our food didn't come out yet. She didn't care; then slammed the pazookie on the table and said ""well happy birthday"" and walked away.  The waiter then came back several times to check on us. We wondered why our food why was taking so long but didn't ask. He then came back with the check!! We asked him where was our food. He said ""oh so you guys do wanna eat here?"" we told him he had already taken our order. He was surprised and realized it was in his pocket but didn't say anything.

I know it's really important to be seen at a happenin' spot in Elk Grove and all, but we were really hungry, so we opted to dine elsewhere. And thus BJ's. The service here wasn't really ""bad,"" it just wasn't really great. At first, our waiter was really energetic and stuff about changing our dishes (eliminating the cheese from the bruschetta and pasta, leaving the bell peppers out of my mom's fish dish. She doesn't like bell peppers), which got us kinda excited to have our food just the way we wanted it. I don't know if he forgot or just didn't care or what. The pasta dish indeed had no cheese (he pointed it out very enthusiastically), but there was cheese in the bruschetta and bell peppers with the fish. We didn't point it out, because he seemed so happy with himself. Actually we didn't point it out because we're both the type of people who are like ""hum dee dum should we say something??? How can we fix this without making a fuss????"" So ultimately my mom picked out the bell peppers and I didn't eat bruschetta. Just to be complainy, I'll add that many of the pine nuts in my dish were burnt. Also, I had to add like 4 cups of salt for it to have any detectable flavor (I might be exaggerating), but I guess that's just personal preference... Overall, the food was decent, it was served quickly... And thankfully only 2/3 of what we ordered... wasn't what we ordered. The place is clean, though, and stuff like this doesn't always happen, so I won't be too harsh with the rating. BJ's gets points as a restaurant because some of its menu items can be veganized.

But every time that we've gone the service has been horrible! The servers normally take a long time, are not very friendly, and they NEVER ask you if you need any change back and just take the change you should get back. One time in particular I asked our waitress if the pesto had nuts in it (I am allergic and told her that) she hesitantly said no, then about 10 minutes later she came back and said ""actually our pesto does have nuts in it. I didn't think pesto had nuts in it."" (DON'T SAY THAT IT DOESN'T THEN IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!) Immediately after she took our order for appetizers and I ordered there stuffed mushrooms. I didn't read the description of the appetizer (that was my fault) but it just sounded good to me, apparently though the mushrooms had a ""drizzle"" of pesto all over them yet the waitress didn't say anything even though I told her more than once that I was allergic to nuts which was in the pesto. Our appetizers come out and the waitress immediately leaves (without seeing if everything looked ok) and I'm left with stuff mushrooms covered in pesto. The waitress disappeared for a long time and then finally walked past our table and I waved her down and asked her if the green stuff was pesto...she looked at me puzzled and said yeah. I told her once AGAIN that I am allergic to the nuts in the pesto and her response, with an attitude was ""well you shouldn't have ordered that then""...I was very irritated at this point  by her terrible customer service and just plain out stupidity, but I tried very hard to be patient. I asked her if they could remake it without the pesto and she tells me that she thinks they put the pesto in the stuffing (I was kind of speechless at this point because I wanted to yell at her) so I just changed my order altogether.  The whole time she never once apologized to me about almost killing me and she gave me attitude as though I was inconveniencing her. PLUS to top things off at the end of our meal she took our check and money and never came back with our change. To sum things up, I honestly think that this waitress is a serious liability if she doesn't know what's in the foods and obviously isn't paying attention to the customers who are specifying food allergies.

She checked on us every once in a while and seemed like she was in a hurry when she did. When she finally came I felt like I had to say what I wanted really fast. What really annoyed me was when I told her I had a Bjs rewards number and she brought me a sign up card. I checked my account online when I left and I didn't see the points so I had to call the customer service line. Obviously I'll go back because BJs has great food and drinks but hopefully we'll get a different server next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=740,3.08,3.12,3.12,2.8320000000000003,3.1040000000000005

I wanted to enjoy it but it was just so bland and chewy. Took me too long to chew the strip of chicken just so i can swallow it. They portion was just right, not skimpy. The pizza here was different from the pizza i eat. Here it was fluffy and deep dished. We had the cheese burger pizza or somethin like that, It didnt taste as good as I hear.  Service: Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing. They are just too busy to really give you the service you deserve. It's pretty much you get seated, they take order and come back with food and rarely check on you. Drinks takes forever to be refilled.

But we came here yesterday with a group of 12 from work for our holiday celebration and they really messed up our group dining experience. I have been here for groups before and they were fine, so I am going to chalk this up to an anomoly, otherwise I probably would have rated this even lower. First off it took a while to be seated even though we had reservations and then it took them a while to bring menus. Ordering seemed to go okay. Personally I try to order as simply as possible in group situations just because things can get messed up easily. Things got very messed up quickly. My food was fine. I got a buger melt and it was satisfying. However, one person in our party had ordered a pizza with no onions and when they brought it, sure enough there were onions. Someone else's soup was lukewarm and someone else had ordered a bowl of soup and recieved a cup. When she asked if it was a cup, they confirmed that it was and she said she wanted a bowl. They said they would bring her another cup to make up for it. She never got her other cup or her brushetta that she ordered. Everyone was done eating and she asked the waitress for her brushetta to go. The waitress was like ""you didn't get it?"" and looked around the table like she was lying. When the bill came she was also charged for a bowl of soup. The new pizza also had to be boxed to go as it never came out during our two hour lunch. Multiple people were also charged seperate entree prices for items that were lunch specials. It took even longer to get the bill straigtened out.  BJ's is almost always crowded, so try and come on less busy times or in small groups unless you want to wait forever. They have lots of beers and the pizza is usually pretty decent.

We were then seated at a table by the grumpiest hostess ever but my mom had asked for a booth and told her so. There was an empty booth that was available but needed to be cleaned. The hostess sighed loudly and said ""ok but it will be a wait because I don't know when they'll clean up. You need to go wait at the front"". Um rude much?? So I said, ""yes we know we need to wait at the front, thanks "". Do you think she asked for anyone to come clean the table after we had already waited for 20 min? Nope.

The manager quickly apologized and cleaned the table himself. After the rude welcome, we had a great time. The food was good and our server was quick and attentive. If you've never been here, you HAVE to try the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also ordered the tomato bisque, the stuffed mushrooms with artichokes, spinach and feta, and the tomato with mozzarella salad. While I thought that the salad was very good, I found it a bit strange that it was topped with Parmesan cheese. Regardless, in my case, the more cheese the better!  Note for management: I wish I had gotten the name of the young girl at the front, but if you know who was working on Tuesday, January 1st around 2:30 - 3:30 pm, she needs an attitude adjustment. Our bill came to over $130 and our money would have gone elsewhere had my dad not spoken to the manager who quickly helped us. I am sure you can understand how it feels to walk into a restaurant expecting a great time and be greeted (actually, she barely said two words to us) by a sour-faced person who exudes ""I hate my job"". Does not feel good. I observed her with other guests, and I even heard someone next to our table say, ""what's her problem??""

588,Jeff B.,"Sacramento, CA",39,8,,1.0,2013-10-06,"One out of five stars. Let me explain why. My Fiance and I arrive on a Sunday night at 7:05 pm. We were seated at around 7:20. As soon as I sat down my toes were splashed with beer from a puddle that resided under our table. That was cleaned up by the hostess - which isn't her job. A few minutes later our server came out and took our orders. We wanted a lemonade and pepsi plus our entres. Over ten minutes later our server came out and said that she was going to have another server help us and immediately walked away. We still had not received our drinks at this point. The new server came out and said she would bring out our drinks right away. By the time we had them at our table it had been 20 minutes after the initial order was placed. We both sat at our table drinking and talking until we realized that a significant portion of time had passed since we had placed our order. When the substitute waitress finally approached our table it was 8:40 pm. I kid you not. She asked ""Is everything okay?"" My fiance said, ""No. We don't have our food. So nothing is okay."" The waitress seemed shocked and said that the previous waitress, who took our order, had told her that we only wanted drinks. Hahahaha who goes to BJ's and orders a pink lemonade and pepsi? So, at this point, we became very irate. We had waited over an hour to hear that our original server had never even placed our order to begin with. Serious? At this point our back up waitress gets the manager who comes out and offers to take care of the meal. He was kind and empathetic towards us. We didn't want to wait any longer so he offered $75 in gift cards. I refused them at first but he somehow convinced us to take them and apologized profusely. He even offered to box up our meals when they were ready so that we can take them home. Again, we refused this offer as we just wanted to leave.  What should have occurred is that our original waitress placed the order like she is paid to do. I'm sure it's not a hard thing to do and I'm sure she has had plenty of training in doing so. Unfortunately, that did not happen. What should have occurred next, is the sub-waitress should have said ""Oh I apologize for the wait your food is almost ready."" Instead she said, ""I was told that all you wanted was the drinks."" By saying this she had revealed that our order was never in, and we had been forgotten by the original waitress.  I spent nearly two hours for $75 worth of gift cards that expire in two months. When we left BJ's it was 8:50 pm. I gave the gift cards to the man who worked the Taco Bell drive through in Elk Grove. I figured I would get rid of any bad karma that may have caused this terrible incident and colossal waist of my time.

It took him 10 minutes get to us for drink orders.  And rather than get me what I wanted he pimped the house brews instead.  So I ask for samples of two specific ales.  He brings those after another 5 minutes and 2 more neither of us asked for.  Luckily this wasn't added to the check.  After we ordered our food the slow waiter vanished for he day for a much more lively and attentive server. The beers themselves served their purpose.  I had a black & tan like concoction that was with an IPA that I found too citrusy on its own and the delicious stout.  Black & tan like because it was clearly not poured over a spoon.  At this point it had been nearly 20 minutes since sitting down so I didn't get too particular about that.  My date for the evening had a wonderful porter with some raspberry soda or juice added.  Normally not my thing but I almost ordered one to go with dessert. For whatever reason I remembered their burger selection being MUCH better than what it was.  Every one of them had mayo and thousand island style sauce.  No biggie.  They gladly removed them both.  Another buck fifty for cheese and bacon.  The Swiss cheese was wonderful.  The two strips of bacon were like baseball glove laces.  Thin and chewy.  Not so great.  Burger itself was cooked to order and plenty juicy.  Saved the entire meal.  Because the cheap iceberg lettuce with it did not.  The regular fries are the dreaded shoestrings.  The seasoned fries are steak cut and MUCH tastier. The chocolate chip pizookie left us leaving happy enough to not write the place off forever.  Total check for the two beers, two burgers and pizookie was $42.  $50 after tipping the waiter that showed up off the bench.

It came with a bigger pizza, choice of salad or soup, and a pizzokie to finish it all off. All of that for $19.95!!! So of course, I opted for that instead. I also got the Oktoberfest beer just to be festive. My friend ordered the shrimp jambalaya which was what I was originally going to get. The pizza was just ok. The sausages on there didn't look that great. And, I'm not sure but it didn't seem cooked all the way. I had a lot leftover and ate it that night. It was not good at all. Normally, you can eat leftover pizza cold but this one had to be heated up! The salad was good though. I had more than enough being just a side salad. The beer was good too. I had a taste of my friend's jambalaya and it was delicious. Perfect amount of spice. So, as far as food goes, it all depends on what you order.  Service was great.

502,Kristen C.,"Sacramento, CA",13,39,,1.0,2014-03-11,"This is, by far, the worst BJ's at which I've eaten. I really enjoy this chains' food and beer, but this specific restaurant severely lacks in customer service. Recently, my boyfriend and I decided to order some takeout from this BJ's after finishing up some shopping in Elk Grove. Initially, we attempted to call for Curbside Takeout. We called, got transferred, then waited on hold for over three minutes before we got fed up and hung up. For whatever reason, we still thought it's be a good idea to head down there and order food in person. The host directed us over to the Curbside Takeout counter. No one was there. I think it finally took ten minutes for someone to realize that we had been waiting. Granted, the place looked pretty packed/busy for a non-weekend night, but I saw at least a half dozen staff members walk past us. No one helped us and no one bothered to answer the phones that rang on and off either. Finally, someone darted out of the kitchen and took our order. This guy obviously seemed rushed and frazzled, but seemed to get all the details entered in correctly and took our payment. We ordered two specialty salads and a fried appetizer. He told us the order would take about 15-20 minutes. Great! Especially we needed to be back in South Sacramento for another commitment in a little over an hour. Fifteen, twenty, thirty, thirty-five minutes passed. Multiple people came and went with their food orders. Multiple servers were standing around the main station at the entrance of the restaurant. An off-duty employee came in, picked up her food, then took some time to go back behind the counter and talk to those that were working. Still no sight of our food. Finally, my boyfriend, who rarely gets mad, stood and waited up at the pick-up counter for five minutes before someone addressed him. This guy, who replaced the one who took our order, heard my boyfriend's complaints, which centered around the total miscommunication with the time frame for our order and our expectations not being met by this experience. (If we knew it was going to take 30-45 minutes we just wouldn't have ordered food and would have gone elsewhere.) This guy was nice and did everything he should have done - checking on the order in the computer and the kitchen, updating us, offering us drinks, then finally getting the manager after our order still wasn't produced. We both felt genuinely bad for this guy since this mess was totally not his fault and we thought he did a decent job with the situation he was given. (Can't remember his name, unfortunately.) The salads came out and the appetizer came out ten minutes later. At that point, we were explaining things to the manager who offered to return the food, which didn't make any sense because we had been waiting for forty five minutes at that point and we had already paid. In the end, we unhappily took our food and raced home with barely any time to eat before our commitment that night. As we checked on the food in the car, we discovered that the chicken in my salad was cold and both salads looked horribly underwhelming and small. For all we know, the salads were made in five or ten minutes then, for whatever reason, the fried appetizer somehow took thirty minutes to drop in the fryer. The appetizers were also not crispy and seemed lacking in ingredients. Absolutely ridiculous. When we ate the food at home, it was alright. I just couldn't enjoy it because of the experience we just had.

Newer menu unveiled recently, with a ton more ""enLIGHTened"" options! Awesome. I have heard service can be iffy, but I just stick to sitting at the bar or in the bar area and we always have pretty good service. I don't much care for the cocktails here, too sweet, but I dig some of the beers (at a brewhouse, fancy that). The food is honestly nothing to rave about, but it's good and decently priced, with options to please anyone. I don't always love everything I try, but my staples are enough for me (California flatbread, wings, broccoli cheddar or tortilla soup, artichoke dip if I'm feeling particularly unhealthy...plus new items Mediterranean chicken pita tacos and kale Brussels sprout salad!).

It's pretty much the go to place to eat if you want something good, you don't want to drive far, and there's something everyone in your group could eat.  Pretty much everything I have ordered here I have liked. There was this one time when I ordered fried calamari at the Roseville location and it looked nothing like how I usually get it. Aside from that, everything is good. The avocado egg rolls are really yummy if you're a vegetarian. I usually always get the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. I just sprinkle some lemon on that bad boy and I'm a happy camper. I've also tried their pizzas and I just think they are amazing. Most of the enlightened menus are pretty good. You can never go wrong any of the pizookies. The beignet is ok.. I would rather order a pizookie any day.  Anyways, just went there a couple days ago. They have a new menu. I think they added about 9 things? Not sure. I didn't get a chance to try any of them but the scallops and the kale salad looks yummy. Will have to try those on my next visit.  I finally tried the tomato and mozzarella salad that I have been eyeing forever. I loved it! Probably gna be in my top favorites salads every time I go there. Also tried the new salted caramel pizookie. It was alright. Wouldn't order it again.. The giradhelli chocolate on top was a little too much for me.  As far as drinks .. I'm not the best to ask.

We arrived at 6pm and weren't seated till a little after 730pm.  We were seated, but it took a minute for them to figure out who our server was going to be. A girl in our party was noticed by an old friend of hers, who was a server, and he offered to get us started. With our large party it took a while to get our drinks. We tried some 'hand crafted' soft drinks like Root Beer and Cherry something or other. I took a few drinks of my Cherry drink, but it tasted like it was made w/ a sweetener. I do not like artificial sweeteners, so I asked him if I could have a Pepsi because I did not like the sweet after taste of this drink. He came back w/ the same drink!!! He thought there was something wrong w/ the drink and that I just wanted a new one. My regular pepsi did not come out till I was almost finished w/ my meal. We ordered 3 apps...mozzarella sticks, and some boneless buffalo wings in Maui Sweet & Garlic Parmesan. We ordered these two flavors cause there were kids in our party and didn't want anything spicy. We were very disappointed when we bit into the Maui Sweet and found they were incredibly spicy, even for the adults. What was even more disappointing is that on their menu it states that the boneless wings are served w/ 10pcs...however we only received 5-6 pcs. Our appetizers came out at separate times, our waiter comped one of them because it was so late...just came out right before we got our dessert. The mozzarella sticks are not bad, but they aren't good either. They are way different from the traditional fried mozzarella that most people are used to getting. The breading was strange and had ZERO flavor at all. The only thing that made it edible was drowning it in Marinara sauce.  The boneless wings were good, had a nice flavor, crunch an the chicken was good. The only bad thing was that they were waaaay too hot to enjoy. I cant really do hot stuff, but others in our party that do even complained about how hot they were. Didnt get a chance to try to Garlic Parmesan since they brought them out just right before dessert. Service in between was hit and miss. There was also the earlier confusion of not having a designated waiter, and the kid that had been helping us was apparently not supposed to and so 2 managers came out and scolded him right behind our table. I think that was tacky on their part, there is a reason why they have an office or seperate place in the back...hell, go yell at him in the kitchen. Shame on the management though for not having a designated server for us. This boy tried to help us when he saw that nobody else was...so kudos to him. I felt bad cause he worked so hard, and then another person came in and took over...I hope she split the tip w/ him. Our food came out an everything looked delicious. I ordered the mini Chicken, Bacon, Ranch deep dish pizza. I am no longer going to order pizza from here, unless it is the regular hand tossed variety. Their deep dish is a joke. Basically you are praying for a disc of bread sprinkled w/ a few toppings...totally not worth it. The tomatoes that were on top were like the ones that you would get from taco bell, there was barely and bacon or ranch. I asked for an extra side of ranch because there was no detectable amount on my pie, and I never received it. It was a waste of almost $11 for a giant loaf of bread...NEVER A G A I N!!! Another person in our party ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and it was so delicious!!! They were served on white cheddar mashed potatoes, although you couldnt really taste the 'cheddar' at all. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the crispy onion strings on top were a nice touch. The plate was very aesthetically pleasin and almost looked too good to eat. I wish I would have chose this as my entree on this visit...I def will next time. For dessert we had the Peanut Butter Pazookie. I think I am also going to hang it up where this is concerned. The Pazookie always takes longer than the other desserts, but every time I order one it comes out w/ some parts undercooked. I have maybe had it one or two times where it was fully cooked. I just don't like biting into what's supposed to be a cookie, and end up pretty much eating cookie dough. The flavor is not bad, but probably wont be something I order again. The girl who stepped in to help us really brought her best game and had no problems. I think the management really needs to step up their game and get their teams organized, thats what they are getting paid extra for. I think one of them should have at least apologized to our table...they were already there chewing the one server out, so why not say 'Hey folks, sorry for the trouble...' I mean our party spent almost $300 there. The food here is typically good and there are plenty of choices #flagproof",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=200,3.48,2.94,3.0,2.668,3.156
387,Gilbert G.,"Elk Grove, CA",186,39,25.0,4.0,2014-06-10,"""You guys wanna do happy hour tonight?"" This is a very popular question amongst my friends and I, but once we hear ""happy hour"", we automatically connect the word to BJ's. This is our spot to go to when we all just want to get together to hang out, celebrate something, or decompress from a long work/school week. We go here so much that our regular waitress, Sarah, remembers us each time (she's such an awesome waitress, btw). If you want to catch a big sports event, this is a good place to go to... But I recommend getting there early because it gets packed! They have plenty of tvs for you to watch the biggest sporting event going on that day, so I'm sure you can sit anywhere and be in sight of a TV.  My friends and I love the bar area. Now as far as the main dining area... Well, we try to avoid it. Depending on when you go, there's usually a wait. I, personally, haven't had a lot of good experiences with customer service with the waiters/waitresses in the main dining area. Whether they're slow at getting you a refill, or sending down the wrong order... There has always some kind of negative experience in the dining area.  The 4 stars are mainly for the bar and it's service there. Always an enjoyable time with the homies.. And great for happy hour.  My recommendations: Any of their craft beers... My go to is the hefeweizen. But Im sure any of them are good. Also, try their great white pizza!

They do a great job maintaining the restaurant's casual yet sophisticated look. I always see a diverse group of people dining in, which is an indicator that they are very welcoming of any race and age group.  Jerry Burst! If you drink alcohol, try it. It's one of their beer and cider blends that I happen to be a fan of. It's Berry Burst cider and their very own house brew, Jeremiah Red. Good aroma of caramel malts, full-bodied, and a bit of hops to it. Taste like it smells, but more robust.  For my main course, I ordered from one of their enLIGHTened entrées -- the Maui Glazed Pork Chop. It was perfectly grilled, tender, with a little kick from the sweet and tangy sauce. It came with steamed green beans and oven roasted red potatoes.  And, of course, if you've heard of BJ's, you know to associate them automatically with their famous pizookie dessert. It's almost mandatory to have them at the end of your meal here. We got the trio this time with Salted Caramel, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Cookies 'N' Cream.

They're very bland and doughy tasting. My last order of BBQ Chicken came out luke warm. My calamari appetizer came out chewy. Their Chicken Fried Steak was less flavorful than in the past and they consider a few sprinkles of corn as a side of vegetables. The pizookies here have gotten ridiculously sweet to the point where it's very hard to eat more than a few spoonfuls. It's pretty disappointing.  The service here when seated is pretty good, but I've found that they tend to need reminding and don't come around that often. My water was left unattended on multiple visits and my beer and condiments i requested almost never got to me. One of my servers started completely ignoring me after I got my food.

But then they started expanding faster than you could say 'McDonald's' and sacrificed quality for quantity to become an interstate brand.   Anyways, my latest (and probably last) experience at BJ's came late one night at the Elk Grove location.  There was hardly anyone there, and my date and me were sitting in a small booth near the bar.  The service was rushed and rude while the food was  soggy and sour.  This was the last of several disappointing experiences, and at some point, you stop complaining to management because it's obvious they no longer care or can't do anything about it.  Farewell BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=360,3.0,3.03,2.98,2.8240000000000003,3.018

We saw open seating in bar area so we took advantage of seating ourself. The front desk girl said she would send someone who knew how the dine in worked. We were greeted my a waitress who we informed we ordered dine in and as as well informed us she didn't get many dine in orders sat in bar area so she didn't know how it worked then asked us for drinks. A different waitress/ maybe hostess dropped of a Tab which had our dine in order on it. About 15 mins later (30 mins into waiting) a manager came by and asked for the tab (we must have looked irritated at this point). I could see him bouncing around to different POS systems and questioning a lot of the staff with our tab in hand. When he walked by with our waiter I could hear him telling her to put in a rush order. He then came to our table and informed us that our order had never been processed and he was going to give us free appetizers. He came by many times after to make sure we were taken care of and did take care of the two appetizers we had ordered through the dine in order. He was very appologetic and informed us he would be talking to his staff personally about the experience.

333,Bruce S.,"Elk Grove, CA",237,361,2176.0,2.0,2014-11-04,A few months ago we received 2 $50 gift cards to BJ's. We went in 3 times for lunch to use them up. No reason to return again as this place is nothing special and the service isn't good. Their prices are high also. They make their own beer so why do the prices start at $5.00 a glass and go up? Not a good deal. All three times we ate there all our order came out at once. Not the appetizers first like we expected. Twice it seemed like we sat for quite a bit before our food came out. Once we got it the food was good enough. The last time we went in we had $13.00 left on the gift card so that means the first two visits averaged $43.50 each.

638,Christine M.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,6,1.0,5.0,2014-11-07,"I would like to preface this by saying: I do not typically enjoy chain restaurants.  I find them to be somewhat generic, impersonal, streamlined, corporate and I think those qualities can put a damper on a quality dining experience.  That being said, I truly enjoyed my experience at Bjs in Elk Grove. Though it was fairly busy, the host And hostesses were friendly, polite and handling the rush with great poise.  While we waited for our table we had cocktails at the bar. I've had trouble in the past being able to grab a drink while I wait for my table, problems range from unfriendly staff, too crowded areas, slow service,etc- it can be exasperating and can sometimes put a damper on the whole evening.  Luckily, this was not the case.  The bar staff was warm and friendly, though obviously busy.  The bartenders were patient and helpful While I choose a drink- I finally decided on one of the bartenders recommendations, Top Shelf Margarita, while my boyfriend had a Jeremiah Red.  Unlike other bars, we were able to be greeted, order and receive our drinks in only a few moments. While we waited in the bar area I observed the staff and servers. Many times in ""rush. Hour"" servers can be stressed and frazzled when they are attempting to juggle all the aspects of their jobs, but it really seemed that everyone was getting along, working together and taking the busy hours in stride. Also, the manager, Vanessa, seemed to be successfully involved in the entire process. It's incredibly refreshing to see a corporate restaurant manager really involved in the entire guest experience- which I think starts with backing up her front of the house people. Vanessa had caught our attention when alcohol transformed some preciously pleasant patrons into something less than desire able.The guests were unsatisfied with the  wait time for a table, and were frankly acting, in my opinion,  verbally abusive towards her as well as the staff. She expertly defused the situation and prevented further disruption to the entire restaurant.  She was calm, rational and handled what could have been an embarrassing conflict with poise and professionalism.  When we were seated our server, Nia, was pleasant and enthusiastic.  She seemed to genuinely be in good spirits, which, as I stated before, has not been my typical experience in chain restaurants.  The pizza we ordered was good; however I do prefer my pizza with plenty of sauce.  I have never tasted such a rich and delicious crust before. The manager from the incident at the bar did personally greet our table and we commended her for the way she handled the confrontation earlier, as well as how well her staff was preforming that evening.  We had (or I had!) the salted carmel pizookie for dessert and it was decadent and so worth all the calories! Though I don't frequent ""chain"" restaurants often, I truly did find my experience at Bjs to be enjoyable.  When people have a strong, dedicated manager, or leader, it reflects in almost all areas of the business.  I believe it truly is a feat to be as busy as the Bjs in Elk Grove is and to not buckle under the pressure of the ""rush.""  I believe the success can be attributed to strong leadership, as well as a talented group of people who work so well together.  With so many amazing restaurants competing for business, it's the restaurants with friendly, outgoing and genuine staff that help restaurants to stand out amongst the crowd. I apologize for the length of this review, I just believe good work should be rewarded with good feedback and Bjs Elk Grove, has made me a ""regular"" at Bjs from now on, thanks to Vanessa and her team!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=500,2.96,3.03,2.996,3.0280000000000005,3.002

To make matters worse, I come in to pick up my food and get ignored ! Clearly there were employees standing there not doing their job but instead talking up a storm with each other.

After our food was delivered my husband asked for a side of ranch  (that he also asked for when we ordered), but it never came. The server did not check on us for 20 minutes after getting our food. When she finally did com to check on us,  I had lost my appetite and just gave my salad back. After that, we could not get the server for another 40 minutes! We had to ask for the check.  Not once did someone come around with water, or ask if we needed anything. We sat for over an hour and a half with 2 empty water glasses at the end of our table.

When we walked in, the parking lot seemed fuller than the inside of the place. We were seated right away at a booth directly across the big screen, showing the Warriors game. Fasho! Even though we already knew they lost, it was nice to watch the game too. I don't remember our waitress's name, but if I had to guess, I think it was Norma. Anyway, ""Norma"" was SUPER nice and just how people in the retail/customer service/restaurant business should be! She took our orders, and my family and I just chatted amongst ourselves and watched the game til our food came. I ordered the bison burger. Since my previous experience with bison burger, at another restaurant, was a big fail, I had to see if it really was a big fail, or it was just because of the situation. Since the bison burger was in the lighter menu, the portion isn't as big as your typical burger. It also had a side of colesaw. The burger wasn't too bad. It didn't amaze me though. The colesaw, same. It didn't amaze me. However, my dish DID fill me up halfway through. If you have a small appetite, I suggest you order from the light menu. It's cheap and portions are just enough to fill you. The downside to our meal was that my sister ordered the pork chop from the light menu as well, and it came with diced potatoes. One of the potatoes was still frozen in the middle. We didn't tell ""Norma"" because it was just ONE potato, but this is just an fyi. Check to make sure your food is thoroughly cooked before digging in. Other than that, everyone enjoyed their food. My other sister, mom, and dad ordered salads, but suckers are HUGE! Kinda wished I got a salad instead. I wish I had room for a pizookie because those things are BOMB.COM! I think I saw that they do 3 mini pizookies for some set price. I think I would do that one day :) Overall, food was just eh, but our waitress, ""Norma"", was excellent! Friendly, patient, and super nice!

After waiting for what seemed like 40plus minutes my brothers French toast came out (ordered after me and my bf) Ok maybe our food took a bit longer so we waited 10more mins...  I see a girl come out confused with plates in her hand talking to the bar tender. Then proceeds to come place the plate infront of me... Well my food was cold looked as if it was sitting, my avocado wasn't even green anymore. The cheese looked like rubber and the food had onions which is specifically requested not to have. My bf pancakes came with no syrup and the pancakes weren't in no way warm.  Luckily after telling the bar tender the food wasn't up to par she personally went and took care of it.

She got the Barbados chicken atop rice pilaf and beans sprinkled with feta and I got the parmasean crusted chicken.  Her's was good but mine was better.  Their parmasean crusted chicken is one of their best item ever!!!! Very moderate in health. Roughly +/- 1000 calories. Comes with 2 crusted chicken breast resting over a scoop of parmasean mashed potatoes topped with a drizzle of melted parmasean sauce and dices sun dried tomatoes and chopped basil. Very well priced and this goes great with their hefeweizen. This place is well organized, speedy with their food and really good customer service.

We have come here quite a few times and had a enjoyable time and food so when we had relatives visit we decided to go there. We were extremely disappointed. First off it took more than 10 minutes after being sat for somone to even acknowledge we were there. They said that it wasn't her table but will take our drink order. 5 minutes later our waitress showed up to take our drink order. We told her it was already taken. She took our food order. My son and I ordered burgers medium. My son wanted only lettuce and tomatoes on it. He also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and my self a ceasar salad as a starter. Took forever for our food to come. They brought his clam chowder out with the spoon submerged in the soup handle and all. They also completely forgotmy salad which I decided to forgo since our meal had showed. Our burgers were well done/burnt. They forgot my sons lettuce and put the tomatoes on the side. My wife got one of her usuals the brussel sprout salad. It was not at all the quality what she has had before. Lettuce not fresh and sprouts were small and few. So the quality of service and food has totally fallen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=600,2.72,2.97,2.932,2.34,2.87

I also tried the cheddar broccoli soup, or should I say cheddar soup with tiny bits of broccoli?!  It's all good!  The mozzarella tomato balsamic salad is refreshing!  They have the best homemade balsamic dressing ever!  April enjoyed her balsamic chicken except she said they could've glazed the chicken breasts with the balsamic dressing rather than drizzle it on.

He informed us my meal would be complimentary.  I did indeed receive a California Burger with potato wedges.  That was the only thing right about my order.  The bottom bun was soggy like it had been sitting a while.  The burger was on the verge of being cold.  The burger had a pink stripe in the middle indicating it was cooked medium and not well done as ordered.  They are pathetic. We are a small group that on Wednesdays visit local restaurants.  We will not be going back to BJ's of Elk Grove.  I find it amusing that there are plaques on the walls outside the front door that indicate the names of the site manager and assistant manager and they are ""share holders of the company.""

Ordered one night around 11:20 which is close to their closing time which I get is a little inconvenient but not that bad since it's only take out. Ordered the three mini pizookies, beignet, chicken Alfredo, and a side of wedge cut fries. When I called to order, the girl immediately seemed annoyed and asked for my number three times. When I got there she told me she didn't write my number down, which I thought was weird since she asked me to repeat it 3 times, and didn't get a chance to tell me that they were out of beignets. A little disappointed because at this point I wasn't able to substitute it for anything because it was 11:50 and the kitchen was closing and if she had written my number down I could've gotten something else. So the only thing they could give me was another pizookie, even though I've already ordered three. And they didn't give it to me for free which I had thought, they charged me. Then when I got home I saw that my chicken Alfredo was extremely dry with very little sauce and only a couple pieces of chicken and broccoli while the fries were barely cooked. So I called the next day to explain very calmly about my bad experience and how I understood that it was around closing time but still wanted good food. They sent me a $15 e-card which only made up for the pasta and we went back a few days later to use it and again had our order messed up when it was four hours before their closing time.

Never once came by to ask us how things are or if we needed more drinks. After 40 min he finally came by and we of course asked him where our food was. Turns out that he never actually put our order in. He apologized and hastened our order, giving us a complimentary salad while we waited.

I looked around as they were seating people.  It was a little odd, noticed quite a few tables who were empty & sat empty for almost 20 minutes before they would seat people.  Not sure if they have new managers.  But noticed some of the booths which could easily seat us were being held for larger parties like 5.  This is a little odd considering the last time we had gone they told us those booths were too small for us & was only for parties of 4 or less.   After waiting for the 30 minutes, we finally got buzzed.  They took us to our table which was in the far corner of the restaurant.  We were seated and the server came over almost immediately to take our drink order.  At the same time, we place our order for an appetizer - Calamari. We received our drinks and shortly after placed our food order.  The calamari came out shortly.  As it was placed on the table, we just stared at our order in a little shock.  For the price, it seemed like 1/2 the order was missing (portions have definitely shrank).  Not sure if we will be ordering it again.  As we sat there staring, we were also looking at how we were going to eat our appetizer.  No place settings at all.  So I had to wave down the server to request napkins and utensils.  Soon after our order came out: Caifornia Flatbread Pizzas:  can't go wrong with flatbread pizzas - very good Ahi Tuna Salad:  lots of pepper on the ahi tuna; a tad bit too spicy - didn't realize there was smidges of wasabi on the sides of the plate, definitely gave the tuna a kick We did have to wave down our server several times to get our glasses filled with water.  Water glasses sat empty a little too long.  Not sure if it is a new policy on only filling the glasses with water if requested by the customer.  But they did not check on us to see if we needed additional refills.  I know they were busy (they did have a quite a few large tables).  Just felt service was subpar.  Not sure if we will be going back soon.  Our visits here are seldom due to the service we receive.  So will give a new review the next time we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260,2.4,2.92,2.924,2.568,2.712

After she took our order, our food didn't come until 30 to 45 minutes later, but our food came out lukewarm to cold.

613,Jared P.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,5.0,2015-07-13,"I've been here twice in the last two weeks (as well as many times before) and I have to say my experience has been consistent and excellent. The only thing that ever annoys me is they don't give you a napkin and utensils when you sit down (had to ask both times). First time I went with my girlfriend. We were seated instantly near dinner time, had a very bubbly and helpful server named Adam, and had our appetizers in under 10 minutes. Same experience for when I went with my parents and brother at dinner time, really quick service. My girlfriend and I got the Avocado Egg Rolls and Sriracha Honey Brussle Sprouts, I highly recommend both. The egg rolls are like nothing you have ever had, creamy avocado slices with a southwest filling and ginger dipping sauce, it works deliciously, and a big portion. The brussle sprouts I will get everytime now, only $5, good portion, and the taste is unlike any brussle sprouts I've had, perfect. They are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, drizzled with a sriracha honey sauce that doesn't over power either taste, nice and tangy, you need to try them. For dinner we got the Black and Bleu Burger and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Our food was there in under 10 minutes after the appetizers, very fast. The black and blue is great, blue cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and roasted garlic aioli, I nearly licked my girlfriends fingers after she gave me a small bite. The pulled pork was fantastic as well, it's huge, great coleslaw, tangy bbq sauce, nice big chunks of pork and a bit of fat back, it was just juicy and filling. After all that we were freaking stuffed, and we had only been there for 30 minutes! Plenty of to go boxes. Adam was prompt all throughout the service, got us anything with a smile and was fast, he got a nice tip. I can't say anything bad about this place, it's like an upscale Cheesecake Factory, and has nearly as many items, something for everyone. The place is really cool looking too, just like a giant sports bar, but not noise or crowded feeling, very nice murals, tons of big screens, and really good low priced beers too.

Even though BJ's is in an area that I frequent I still don't come here very often. On this particular trip I was actually pretty disappointed with my visit. First off, when our drinks were brought out to us our waitress just placed them on the table and walked away. Suffice to say, we didn't know who's drink was who's and needed to do a taste test in order to know. Luckily, we were all family so germs weren't a huge issue. The next thing we noticed was that our chicken wings were not steaming hot. Yes, the outer crust was fried well but the temperature of the chicken meat was lukewarm. Within 30 mins, the 4 of us started to get slight stomach aches. I'm not saying it was because of the chicken but the only thing we ate were the wings and the 4 of us were not complaining of stomach issues until after we ate the wings.   This visit wasn't the best, I have had better experiences at this BJ's before I began yelping.

Probably why I'm willing to drive all the way to the Arden location to get better service. My most recent one was with my family a couple of days ago July 14. My wife and I were at the bar and ordered drinks while waiting for our table. We got our drinks fine and after 10 minutes we got called for our table. Took my family to the table and my wife was trying to pay our drinks. It took the bar 15 minutes just to settle the tab. Then we ordered our food. Took another 35 minutes to get the food out. I ordered a lunch menu of lemon chicken with rice and said it's going to be dinner portion with a lot of rice and chicken. That was not the case. It was lunch portion at a dinner price. I argued that the serving was very thin and the brussel sprout were under cooked and under seasoned. Our server Kayla (who is awesome by the way) agreed with me and tried to correct the situation by asking the manager what can be done. The manager did not want to do anything or at least come talk to me. Therefore I will give this restaurant 1 star.

We sat waiting for service. Waitress passed us a few times. Twenty minutes later a server asked if we had been helped and went to get our menus. I saw him hand them to a waitress, who walked them to another table(customers had just sat down). She turned towards our table and I informed her that we had been waiting. She then tells me ""He has your menu"". As I open my menu, she asks if I'm ready to order?(I've only turned the first page) I ask for a few minutes.

I had only turned 21 two months prior, and so after seeing my ID, she proceeded to call me a baby and wouldn't stop patting me on the shoulder for not knowing what I wanted to drink. Uhh...

When it comes to service, I have nothing to complain there. 5 stars for the service!! I have come here a couple of times for half off wine days on Tuesdays.  When I do, I usually get, the Unlimited Soup & Salad Bowl of house made soup and a house, Caesar, wedge or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad (unlimited refills). Which is really good.  I love the Chicken Tortilla Soup (Clam chowder is not too bad either). Today I was with family celebrating an upcoming wedding.  I ordered a Malbec red wine and it had turned sour.  The waiter was very apologetic and said that he would get a fresh bottle and glass for me.  It took some time to get, but I had water with lemon to quench my thirst.  Probably a healthier choice.  Anyway, when it came time to order I decided to step out of the box, with a Thai Chicken Mango Salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, Bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in sweet citrus chili dressing.

462,Sherrine K.,"Davis, CA",107,49,6.0,1.0,2015-08-04,"The food is good don't get me wrong, but when you have service 3 times in a row that's shitty.... I think that was my family's last time going there. Each occasion we were judged by how we were dressed.  Occasion 1: dressed well due to going out shopping in Walnut Creek and returning back to EG and not wanting to cook. The server seemed to have a bad day, and took that out on us. She never came by to see how the food was tasting, nor did she make the experience extraordinary... So we felt she didn't really deserve a tip. We left 10% because we aren't assholes. I for one am a bartender prior, and have never had or given such stupid service. Keep your mood elsewhere. Because when she came to pick up the check, this pretentious little server decided to gawk at it and what? You think you deserve 20$ for not doing anything for us??? We saw the busser more than you! Occasion 2: We had a long day during Ramadan, and didn't want to cook a terribly long meal. So we came out here again, despite the bad service. Now dressed in PJ's, basically, we received bad service again from this man. He was taller, had brown hair, and looked about 27. He frickin doesn't give us service. He spent more times at the other tables than ours. He would laugh with them, and then come to us and look at us like we weren't worth his time. Jokes on him, my mom owns one of the most prestigious salons and is well off, and my man runs a luxury car dealership. So we aren't broke. But for bad service, I notice all this stuff. Because at my old restaurant job, we were told never to treat anyone bad or to judge by looks. Just to GIVE GOOD SERVICE.  Occasion 3: This is where I was BEYOND LIVID. We came back from a wedding, and since eating super early, we came in later in the evening and wanted to eat again. Now we love the food which is why we come here, but this is our last time coming for sure. We had a thicker lady server who looked 30 something. She was okay at first, but I saw that the male server from Occasion 2 spoke with her while walking away... (i know this tactic. ""Watch out they aren't gonna tip you well.""). As soon as she came back we all noticed she was different. She gave us glares, shook her head when walking away when we weren't ready to place an order, and never really refilled waters... Sipping on ice is not cool. They wanted to give her $40 dollar tip on a $110 dollar check because they were in good spirits from the wedding, but we were arguing because honestly she didn't deserve it. Especially with her tag team partner. I don't know how much in the end they tipped because I was irked and left early.  Management: CHOOSE BETTER SERVERS. Not older entitled people who use serving as their career because they couldn't get a normal job due to their attitude and judgmental behavior.  I really wanted to have your food for my birthday, but I steered clear away because I didn't want to deal with this another time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=520,3.04,2.88,2.96,2.372,2.9440000000000004

272,Daniel H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",26,83,,1.0,2015-08-23,"Let's start with the pro's...  The food was good and the price was great.  The reason I give this 1 star is because of what we experienced at the restaurant.  The waitress was actually very awesome and very nice and sweet to my kids.  It really pisses me off of the experience we witnessed.  But let me start at the beginning.....      I was born and raised in the Bay Area but my family and I live in Austin Texas.  We came to Elk Grove searching for homes as we are planning on moving there.  We went to see a realtor in Elk Grove and afterwords decided to try BJ's.  There is a BJ's in Austin TX, but never really had an inkling to go into it for some reason as we associate it with alcohol more often then a food establishment.  Don't get me wrong, we like some liquor every once and a while but never thought of it as a place to want to drink or eat.  The BJ's in Elk Grove was right across the street from the realtor, so we decided to give it a shot.      I ordered some Clam Chowder, which was excellent BTW, and my wife ordered a specialized salad which was also great.  We were greeted with a friendly waitress that immediately took care of us.  The problem started as we were waiting for our meals.  Not less then 10 feet away, a guy, who I guess was her manager, pulled her aside and started yelling at her in front of everyone.  The place was pretty full of people and I could clearly say that over 5 groups of people eating there heard this scene.  As both my wife and myself have been in customer service pretty much our entire lives as well as my degree is in Organizational Psychology, I was seriously appalled by what I witnessed.  I mean the manager yelled at her so loud that she almost started crying right on the floor, and both my wife and myself were just stunned and very uncomfortable about what we had just witnessed.  As a managers performance, that was probably one of the most unprofessional things anyone could do to anyone under their employment, and not just the employee, but themselves, as they speak and act on behalf of the company.   I do not know what the waitress could have done to have been treated so unprofessionally by the manager but we asked to speak to the manager he never came.  Either way, we have every piece of data that they would need to find out when it happened, but I seriously doubt they even read these nor care about that experience after what we had experienced on how they treat their employees. No food is worth of having to watch that type of disrespect for their employees and customers.  The manager should have taken her off the floor and spoke to her, not yell at her, period.  If need be write it up, whatever the case may be, but belittling, yelling, and disciplining an employee in front of customers is just wrong.  I sure as hell won't support any type of business that feels that this is a good way to treat employees.  The employee was so embarrassed, that she could not even look at us in the face anymore.  I don't blame her.        I really do not know who trained this manager at his job, but he is just not manager material.  He is either a bully that gets off on treating his employees like dirt, or just a very poor excuse for a supervisor.  If this company allows this type of behavior, I cannot see how they are still in business.   Sorry, I tried to remain semi-professional in this post, but even days after the fact, which is what I do before I post on here, I am still steaming about this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=360,2.8,2.81,2.96,2.6600000000000006,2.806

76,William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1745,1258,9456.0,3.0,2015-09-29,"You know, I've been to BJ's at Elk Grove many times for the past 5-6 years, so I got a chance to write this review for now. As a customer dining here at Elk Grove BJ's, I was satisfied for their experiences and honesty for me. I was such an honor for making me a great customer. Located near the Highway 99 entrance at Laguna Blvd, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse delivers all kinds of food and drinks from specialty entrees (ie. pizzas and signature dishes), finest beer and wine selections, the well known popular dessert Pizookie, and many more. As I entered, the atmosphere is quite large for this lone building, so you can have great dining pleasures here as well as the bartender side too. The concept remains the same as most BJ's restaurants do across the U.S. The employees for this BJ's are doing a great job as I welcome there. The bartenders, hosts, and servers are maintaining the customers very well for recommendations, orders, and the quality of the food or drinks. So far, no cons at all. For the lunch entree, I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which this plate contains one seasoned chicken breast with sauteed vegetables and fresh mild salsa on top over brown rice. As I ate it, it tasted very good! The chicken breast cooked perfectly well and eatable as well as their vegetables and salsa too. Their Lemon Thyme Chicken presentation looked much better than the Arden or Roseville location. Not a bad complete meal at all. Additionally, I also ordered the Chocolate Chip Chunk Pizookie which it's free for purchasing an order of $9.95 or more for today's exclusive offer on 9/29/2015. So far, that Pizookie is incredibly awesome! I can feel the baked chocolate chip cookie dough very smooth and elegant. The two scooped vanilla ice cream on top also tasted good too. What a great Pizookie. There's some good amount of parking available, so you can park anywhere near or far without the hassles.

I've been eating at this place since it opened, and I used to enjoy every experience. Now it is quite normal to have an order messed up and be told incorrect wait times. It's seems like a lack of leadership, proper training and experience are to blame. The last time we visited, my sister ordered a vegetarian version of a chicken sandwich. My sister does not eat meat at all, but she was almost finished with the sandwich when she realized they did not take the bacon off the sandwich. We told the manager (Vanessa) about the mishap. We were not looking for the item to be taken off the bill, since the majority of it was eaten, but what would have been sufficient is a simple apology.

Food was as expected and service was good.  After our server brought our check, we were pretty much left on our own. The check came quickly after the dessert came out. We put our card in and continued to finish dessert. After maybe 15 mins or so, the waitress hadn't come back to pick up the card to run it. We decide to wait a little longer and keep chatting. Another 10 or so mins past and still no waitress. The restaurant had gotten busier, but to not come back within almost half an hour is a long time! We decide to take our check to the front and have the cashier run it. Everyone was running around. When we finally find someone we tell them our waitress hasn't come back to run the card and we've waited awhile. He takes the bill and card to the back and comes back to tell us only the server can run it, so he gave it to her.  Another few mins waiting at the front, we haven't gotten our card or receipt back. I see a guy, who looks like he can be the manager and asked him for help. He too was running around that I had to come back to him again and remind him we were still waiting for our card.

I felt the service on the day we went was spot on. Our waitress was very attentive and kept checking on us throughout the meal.  Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My hubs is really into the little greek tacos they offer. I tried the cold quinoa salad and it was delicious! I'd eat that by itself.  I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was nicely cooked and the breading was good. I didn't like the tarter sauce, it had thick cut pickles or something, super overpowering. Get the thick cut fries and a side of honey mustard, yum! There's a sweet and salty kind of vibe going on.   We passed on dessert and all that jazz. The servings are big enough for 14 people so I had tons of leftovers. I left the fish and took the fries. Pro tip: reheat them in the oven at 425F, or under the broiler if you dare!  Thanks for giving back to our Veterans BJ's Brewhouse. It was really fun to see all the cars in the parking lot with the different service branches on them.

625,Krista G.,"Elk Grove, CA",500,61,86.0,1.0,2016-01-25,"Tried the Curbside Pick To Go last night for dinner. First, you should never offer a service that you can't follow through on. The ONLY good thing about the experience was the online ordering. We schedule our pick up for 7:30pm. We arrived at that time and called the phone number as instructed. A girl answered and said they would be right out. 20 minutes later we called again and they said our order would be right out. 40 minutes after arriving someone finally came out. We made payment by credit card, which the server had to walk all the back into the restaurant to process. BJs can't afford mobile POS systems? The server returned with our receipt and we voiced our experience and her response was ""I'm only a Bagger."" If you're the only point of contact for a business, then your more than just a Bagger you represent the business and you should not give an excuse like that to a customer. We arrive home (we live less than 1/2 a mile away). We unpack the bag and find our order was wrong. I looked at the itemized receipt and everything we ordered was on there it just didn't make it into the bag. How hard is it to put an order together when everything is listed with the details? Seems like if your job is only a Bagger you should be excellent at it. Due to the excessive amount of time we waited, everything was cold and our ice cream was melted.

Need less to say we thought of going to some place in downtown, however due to the weather we decided on staying local! I can definitely say that was a big MISTAKE! So it was a FRIDAY night and I know many places tend to get busy! So I called in and put my name on the list so when we got there we wouldn't have to wait as long! So I called about 4:45Pm and put my name on the list and I was told it would be about an hour wait, so i was like ok not bad since my cousin will be back in town by then. My cousin arrives before I did and my cousin was told it is still an hour wait when it was already 5:45PM. So she calls me and tells me and I was like ok lets go to a different place, although that didn't make sense to me at all. So we decide to end up going to apple bee's although our first choice was BJ's! while we are on our way to Apple bee's I get a text message that our table was ready from BJ's! So I hurry up and call them and let them know we are on our way! However noone picks up the phone! SO I asked my mom to call and I kid you not they answered in one ring! So that was a little odd! So my mom tells them we are coming they don't say anything! we were already in the parking lot so I drop them off and went to look for parking! Minutes later my mom calls saying she was told it's still an hour wait, although we waited for so long! So I was totally upset and din not want to dine here at all! I call and speak to the manager VANESSA!! and explained to her the situation and she kindly told me that we should not have been told we would have to wait another hour, in fact we shoulde been seated right away!

44,Allison L.,"Sacramento, CA",301,282,2340.0,4.0,2016-02-22,"I eat at BJ's about once every three years and only because other people want to. It's not that I have anything against them, it's just a very crowded, calorie-heavy, and somewhat expensive restaurant. It does offer a wide variety of food, however, so it's good for groups.  I came here on a Saturday night around 6:30 with my boyfriend, his two nephews, his sister, and her husband. When we arrived there was already a crowd of people. There is a parking lot but it was pretty full. The hostess informed me it would be a 45-50 minute wait. I gave her my phone number and she said they'd text me when our table was ready. Luckily it wasn't too cold outside so we sat outside and waited. It ended up being an hour before we were seated. This is pretty normal for BJ's.  We got a corner booth table. Our hostess was pretty friendly and brought out our waters quickly (though the refills later on were slow).  Some of the dishes I tried: Avocado egg rolls: very tasty, but a little too much avocado. You can't eat that many of these.  Potato skins: nice and crispy on the bottom but still soft enough. Lots of bacon!  Chicken Alfredo: kinda strange that it comes with broccoli mixed in, but I guess that makes you feel *healthier.* Generous portion.  Chicken club flatbread: in the appetizer section, but large enough for an entree. Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, aioli, and avocados on a crispy flat bread. A nice change from the thicker, saucey pizzas.  Chocolate chip pizookie: perfectly warm and melty with nice cold ice cream on top! Everything was tasty and the temperature of the food was hot, which was good. The manager actually knew my boyfriend's brother in law, and he went out of his way to make sure we all had a great dining experience.  This is the kinda place where you end up eating and talking for about 2 hours, which is probably why it's always so busy and has a wait time.  Overall, a positive experience. I don't frequent here too often but I would recommend if you have a group of friends or were getting together for a birthday dinner.

I will say this the first time the manager on duty was nice enough to to send me a $15 gift card but my friend who's order was also messed up never heard back. They had the wrong ice cream flavor and her mushrooms were un-edible because she asked for one main ingredient to be removed. Another confusion is I ordered curbside pick up a different day, but where the heck do you go for the curbside pick up, good thing I went in so they again didn't give me what I ordered and had to wait.

Food is consistent with all other bj's. I do not wish her to get fired but she defiantly needs to be retrained.  Came here yesterday for dinner with 3 other friends and I would say it was a normal day. They had a good number of tables filled, but being super busy was defiantly not what had cause these errors to occur.          First she stopped by our table and asked for our drink orders.  While one friend was still decided on her drink, she just walked away without saying a word. And when she did come back and my friend had ordered an alcoholic drink, the server did not even card her. Which we didn't really care as my friend is 27, but she was definitely not doing her job.  After we had placed our order and the food came, she never returned to check on table. We had to ask other servers for assistance. Which they were glad to help but it was not their job to serve our table.  When she final came to ""check"" on us, she had the bill and asked if we would like anything else. We had ordered a pizookie at the beginning with our meal. When we reminded her of this, she just said ""oh yeah."" Also at this point we had ask her for two to go containers and one soup container.  She then came back with the two to go containers, and the bill before our pizookie even got to our table. We also reminded her of the soup container which she stated with an attitude that she's getting it.  We had 2 gift cards and asked to split the rest onto 2 credit cards. Which should be roughly around $20 each. She then returns and states that the machine ran most of the bill ($45) on my card and the machine was not taking my friend's card. Asking my friend if she had another card. At this point it was only $5 so I just asked her to charge it all to my card, which was not a big deal. My friend then went online to reviewed her card history and the card that was ""declined"" had already been charged. It was the one that had been charged the $45, which her bank probably froze the second time she tried to swipe it for an additional amount.  And if she had split the bill like we had asked, we don't understand how a $45 bill would have been charged. It would have been $20, and the other $20 was declined.  When she finally came back after charging our cards, we confirmed that my friends card was charged the $45 and mine was charged $5 (our names and last four of the card numbers are on the receipts, which she could also had seen to realized that she had charged the same card that she stated was declined) Also at this point we still did not get the soup container, which we asked for again. When we saw a few minutes later that she was assisting a different table we asked a different  server who got it right away for us. She never came to apologize or I don't even think she remembered/cared that she forgot it AGAIN. When she finally came with the pizookie and I was in the middle of packing my meal. She then picked up one plate from our table and proceeded to grab my plate from my hand (when I was still packing) when my friend had her empty plate right in front of me.  And as we were sitting there finishing our pizookie and chatting she came back to grab the bill from under my hand and just walked away. I would think the proper thing to do would be to ask for it.

But i wasnt going to complain because i was already way to hungry.

Mind you at this point there isnt a big crowd and our server was no where to be seen along with having to speak to the manager twice and the manager finally clearing the last plate. We thought at least she had talked to her well it didnt appear to because asking for our checks three times and then having to flag down a busser along with talking to the front to get the manager back over it had already been 2hrs and 15mins. Then ontop of that we had seperate checks and she couldnt even get that right. Being someone who had worked in the restaurant industry before as a server when you have unhappy customers try to at least communicate.

I felt embarrassed as their host to bring them here. I'm usually a good tipper, but it goes both ways. I left a dollar.  A few months ago I was here with a local friend. We sat at the bar on a Saturday for lunch. I completely finished my meal by the time he received his order. It was no fun eating alone. Management offered a tepid sorry, but no comp.

To the lady who complained that you got there before us and we were seated first...umm try the waitlist and maybe you'll get seated faster.  Food is ok, in my opinion. I ordered the french dip in which the bread was burnt. My little kids got the kids cheeseburger meals and the the meat was enough for just one bite. What the heck was that about? Hubby and my oldest daughter ordered a sirloin and they were happy with their meals- aside from getting an empty bottle of A1 sauce :/  And all our fries were cold and hard.  Anyway, they were busier than normal tonight. I don't think they were prepared for the families coming for the fundraiser. I overheard a server tell a customer that they didn't know why they were busier than normal. Communication between managers and staff maybe lacking? Who knows! All I know is that it was a long wait for our server to come to the table to introduce herself, a long wait for our drinks and appetizers, a longer wait for our food. When our food finally arrived, they forgot our ranch and we got an empty bottle of A1 sauce.  I get they were busy and maybe over whelmed, and normally service is better that's why the 4 stars.

It wasn't just the best service that I have ever had at BJ's, it was probably the best service I've had at a restaurant EVER. And I eat out a lot.  AJ was super sweet to the kids, took his time to engage with them and listen and make them feel special. It was really kind and thoughtful. He was prompt, brought us everything that we needed, refilled drinks so quickly and when my mom asked for a small lemonade to try, he brought out a regular sized one. When we were done, he came to the table and asked my stepson if he wanted a pizookie. For free!! I just could not believe it. Our day was made.

Everybody received there food except me, and at first I thought they were just taking time to make my burger but then 25 minutes passed and I still haven't received my food so I waited for the waitress to come back. She walked pass and ask if I was okay I told her I haven't gotten my food but she was in her own world and just said glad to hear like I said something else and walked off and I waited another 15 minutes. She finally walks by again and I told her my dilemma and she said oh really let me check. She finally comes back and says the servers drop my burger at the wrong table and basically made me waited for no reason. I'm pretty piss at this moment because my whole group was basically done with there food while I'm still waiting, she tells me they'll have your burger any minute and she walks off. 35 minutes pass and I still waiting for my burger and then she finally brings my burger and man was I disappointed. The burger was greasy from top to bottom and seem like they rushed it and it just tasted soggy and gross.

Remind you we have dinned in so many times here and have had an awesome experience and always enjoyed the food when we dined in. We were so shocked but I was starving and wanted to give my burger a chance. I ordered just a plain burger with cheese. I paid for that. The burger had no cheese and a lot of lettuce, pickels and tomatoes. The fries were wedge, weren't all the way cooked. My boyfriend order the pasta Parmesan chicken and the chicken wasn't cooked so he just ate the pasta. The Egroll appetizers were super soft. Not crunchy like a egg roll at all like we have experienced in the past. I was up all night my stomach hurt so bad from eating barley have that burger, It was bad meat.

91,Jason B.,"Corona, CA",45,189,162.0,5.0,2016-10-16,"You may be a fan, or you might not. Really depends what you're looking for. Let me explain.  When I first went to a BJs, I expected something other than what it was. I had already become well entrenched in craft brew snobbery, by countless visits to independent brew pubs and micros. So walking in to BJs I had expectations that were pretty well not met. Initially.  When I go to a place that serves it's own brews, I'm expecting to see giant fermenters, miles of steam pipes, a huge copper boil kettle, a massive mash and lauter tun, all that! I crave the permeating, cloyingly dense sweetness of a fresh malty wort being boiled, and the trip to heaven I get when they dump in the first load of hops and the air becomes pure lupulin magic.  I didn't get that. What I got was a fancy restaurant, built around a brew pub theme, with beers served that apparently they brew elsewhere especially for BJs. So you understand it took me a little while, a couple of beers, and perhaps one corner of a napkin before I got past my preconceptions.  Having done that, and set on a course to enjoy myself in spite of myself, I ordered some food and tried some of their signature brews. The Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite, with many other close seconds. Whatever else you might say, they do serve good beer. Their own, and other micros and Belgians.  Why do they still get 5 stars? Their food. O.M.G. it's freaking amazing. Their pizza is off the chart. Just go try it. You'll not be disappointed.  Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub!  But still worth the trip every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=40,3.36,3.14,3.148,2.9960000000000004,3.2280000000000006

115,Tina H.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,24,3.0,3.0,2016-12-29,"My coworkers and I always come here to grab a bite after our shift, so I know the menu really well. I just wished they had more pasta options! I really miss the cajun pasta they had a while back. I decided to take my family here for dinner around 6:30pm on a Thursday night and it was jam packed. I was told by the hostess that the wait would be around 30~40 minutes and that I would get a text when the table for 4 would be ready. 25 minutes pass and our table is ready. My family and I got Samuel as our server. He was great, it took him a while to get our drinks, but I totally understand since it was pretty busy. He checked on us several times throughout our meal and was overall a patient server, just a little forgetful (we didn't get a to-go bag and had to ask for water refills).  My family and I ordered a variety of items on the menu. For the appetizer we got the boneless chicken wings with sriracha dry rub and crispy flatbread nachos. I found the boneless chicken wings to be like a better version of chicken nuggets, but more crispy and a little bit on the salty side. The crispy flatbread nachos were amazingly good for something that didn't have meat at all! For the entrees, we got the clam chowder bread bowl w/ a side of caesar salad, fresh atlantic salmon, new orleans jambalaya, and the parmesan crusted chicken. The clam chowder bread bowl that my little sister ordered had less soup than we anticipated, it was mostly sourdough bread. My mom liked the fresh atlantic salmon and my dad enjoyed the new orleans jambalaya because of the dish's spices. I thought the jambalaya would be more on the soupy/saucy side, but it still tasted good. The entree that I did not enjoy was the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was not crusty enough, was kind of on the dry side, and just lacked flavor, so the price of $16.50 for that dish was steep, however the mashed potatoes that came with it was so good though! Every time I go to BJ's, whether it's with friends, coworkers, or family, the food is decent and the portions are pretty big. The service is average. Overall, I always enjoy coming here to eat and catch up with friends.

Every time we've come to this location the service has been mediocre to poor. We usually don't dine at peek hours either. Today we came right after the lunch rush was over and before the dinner crowd. Maybe 60 people total in the restaurant. Our waitress Nadine started out promising. After she took our orders that was the last we saw of her until she brought the check. She never checked on our drinks or checked on us at all. When she brought the check she forgot to deduct the coupon I had told her about prior. (Which is ok) but that took another 10 mins before she got back to us. I even asked for a refill on my daughters drink and she forgot. I had to go up to the front desk where Morgan I believe had outstanding customer service. She offered us drinks to go and went to talk my husband about the bill. Also the table next to us had to wait a good amount of time before a server showed up.

If you have never been to Bj's then its a great place to try or go with a group of people because they have a little bit of everything.  I would say not all the food is great, but they did perfect the pizookis, and I do enjoy their craft beers.  One thing I do not like about this place is they get rid of a lot of stuff on their menu randomly.

Though it had plenty of seats, it was still decently filled with people. Never really have to worry about parking since the lot is huge, unless you like to park close.  This night, service was great and the mixed drinks we got were awesome. We had gotten the strawberry freeze and a strawberry mojito. The freeze was sweet and yet the alcohol was a hit still. The mojito was also very good, could sit there and order a ton without realizing we would get drunk. I got my usual California chicken club which is always a hit for me. The chicken is moist and the avocado is fresh. I usually get extra sauce in the sandwich but this time it came with a perfect amount. The other order was the bj's house burger and was pretty good itself if you didn't want bacon or cheese. I'm only knocking a star down because the pizza hasn't been tasting as good as it used to be. The usual bbq chicken had very little flavor and chicken itself.

For California high schools, their version of March Madness (state playoffs) is here. My crew was assigned to a game in the Sacramento area yesterday. Our original plan was to go to Stagecoach Restaurant for our pregame meal, but we arrived 15 minutes after their closing time. BJ's in Elk Grove became our backup plan at the suggestion of one of my crew mates.  This BJ's is located in a big shopping center right off the Laguna Boulevard exit of Highway 99.  We walked in at around 3:30pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were prompted greeted and seated by one of the hostesses. The interior was very clean and the design appeared very similar to other BJ's locations that I've been to.  One of the servers came by with menus and took our drink order. Since we were kind of in a hurry, we quickly ordered: - Broccoli Cheese Soup (small, $4.75) - Chicken Club Sandwich ($11.75) - Late Night Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - 2x Diet Pepsi ($2.95 each) - Root Beer ($3.25) Food didn't take too long to arrive. I had the brisket and bacon burger and it was pretty decent. The patty was cooked to a perfect medium and seasoned well. It was topped with chopped brisket and two strips of bacon. The light bun held together despite the heavy ingredients. The fries were crispy and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. My two partners liked their food as well. PQ, who had the broccoli cheese soup and Chicken Club Sandwich, told me both were very good. ES, who had the Late Night Burger, appeared to like his food as well. His burger came with a fried egg, bacon, and pepper jack cheese. A liberal amount of chile verde was also a part of the burger. ES told me he loved the sloppiness of the burger!   Service was very good. Two servers constantly checked on our needs and refilled our drinks. With T/T, the bill came out to $56. Not bad for three people! I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants but my experience at this BJ's today was a pretty good one. But with that said, it is unlikely I will return to this particular BJ's because I'm not from the area.

First let me start off my saying our waiter DJ was AWSOME!! But the Service part that he couldn't control was horrible. After my family decided on what to order we patiently waited for an hour for food we never received after waiting 15 min for a Pepsi.. I decided to just get the food to go considering I waited so long to eat I wasn't t even hungry anymore. I called over the manager to inform him what was going on and he proceeded to let me know how it was not ok and assured us that hey we're bagging up our food. After waiting a additional 30 min for our food we decided to just go ahead and leave with out that food. My mother not only had to drive all the to Roseville with out food but her graduation dinner was completely ruined..

The next time I dine-in, I'll be sure to capture pics. Overall, the service here has always been stellar, both for to-go and dine-in.

Sometimes the service is great, sometimes the service really sucks, like really sucks... This used to be the go-to spot for birthdays within my friend group but I'm really glad that we out grew that.   One of my favorite dishes here is the Southern Fried Chicken (pictured). I also really like their Jalapeno burger. Too bad they don't have the crispy thin fries anymore!!! (or that's what they told me last couple times I went, I'm heartbroken). And of course, who doesn't love their pizookies! I'm actually really craving one now that I'm thinking about it!   Those dishes are the main things that keep me coming back, but I usually just get all of those things to-go now a days to avoid the inconsistencies with this particular location. But BJ's as a whole is a good place for lunch/dinner. Be sure to sign up for the email/club. They often do buy one get one free entrees and free pizookies with purchase! So if you like BJ's, be sure to get on that. And on their rewards system! I always forget to tell them to add my points when I pay! Oh, another comment - I do like that they're open late.

I enjoy the menu at BJs and wanted a fun lunch experience since it was my choice to pick a place. I downloaded the app, had an awful time getting my coworkers salad order in, took 3 different try's and she had to pick a different item since none of the 3 salad choices were avail. My order was in by 11:55, and our dine in time was for 12:15.

He didn't make any eye contact or acknowledge what she said. He continued to ask for drink orders. I leaned over and showed him my phone with the order detail and asked if the order was fine, he waived a piece of paper and said I have this. Never looked at me or answered my question, he was so rude and impolite. We did not see him until 12:44 when our food and to go boxes were set down on our table.

The experiences have ranged, sometimes the food is so overly fattening I've been left with a tummy ache and other times I've had really memorable experiences.  I came here for my brother's graduation and used the app they suggested to be put on a 'waitlist'. It's not really a reservation since you can't do that unless you have a party of 7 and over, but it's somewhat like priority seating?  Obviously being in a small town where the HS is from Elk Grove, a majority of the kids and families actually ended up back in EG at this BJ's. It was PACKED. Wow, I heard the waitress say the wait was upwards of an hour and thirty minutes, but because we had used the app around 8:00 and gotten to the restaurant around...9:40 (?) we were actually seated within about ten minutes. Parking was a hassle because of how busy it was, but normally it isn't.  Our waitress was great, super friendly and accommodating to my family. Major plus for her.  We started with calamari, which I unfortunately stayed away from because ya know diet. Meh. And then we also had the avocado egg rolls, which my mom and dad both love. They were pretty spicy, at least for me. Good though! I also had a virgin mint mojito, because no calamari but I will down a glass of simple syrup.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got one of what seems to be their newer bowls, it had salmon and quinoa in it with veggies. It was actually not bad! Loved the salmon and ended up pretty full. I didn't finish all of my salmon, but did some decent damage. The brother had his lovely spaghetti and chicken thing, mom had a burger, dad had a mushroom vegetarian burger thing and my aunts had dishes I didn't try and forgot about. The important part is, no one sent their food back and everyone was happy.  We ended the night with two chocolate chip pizookies. They have some sort of Wednesday deal where the original ones are half off. I didn't hear anything she said after that as I furiously decided which one I wanted to buy for 50% off. I'm glad we got two, we have the family members who just want a taste, but seem to consider half of a dessert 'just a taste'. Having two satisfied four people well.  Overall, great experience. It also helped that the atmosphere that night was exciting.  A lot of families celebrating graduations for their kids.

When we got there the greeting hostess was very nice. However the hostess that was assisting in seating had a look on her face like she hated her job. The actual hostess that sat us assisted in cleaning the table so that we can be seated and she was very kind. Our waitress then came over and took our drink order and she to was kind. We placed our order with a couple appetizers and then our entrées and proceeded to wait as you would expect for the appetizers to arrive. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed as it took so long for us to get our appetizers to arrive and when they arrived at the table were lukewarm at best, as if they were left in the kitchen for some time. We then realized we did not have utensils or napkins or even appetizer plates and we had to ask for that as well. Upon inspection of the silverware we noticed spotting and food particles left on some of the utensils. When our meals arrived my sons plate which was hot wings should have been hot from the heat and not from the sauce but they two were lukewarm at best the fries that accompanied his dish again barely hot. The chicken on my salad as well as the shrimp on my husbands were also under temperature. We did not complain only because it was so late and felt that a complaint would only delay our meal that much longer.  I would not suggest returning to this place and I'm very surprised of the number of people who are constantly waiting to get in. Although the price is not astronomical it is a little higher than your average restaurant and you would hope that you get what you pay for and clearly on this visit we did not.

Ended the dinner with the signature pizookies. I ordered a regular sized white macadamia, but was given a mini size and the cookie was already cold.

We ordered pizza and salmon. We had to ask for silverware and pre-drops.  My boyfriend ordered a side of brussel sprouts with his salmon and he was charged the appetizer price. Our food was cold but since at this point we had been there an hour we didn't want to say anything. Our server tried to make up for our terrible experience with a free dessert. Wasn't worth the 25 minute wait. It was cold and hard. It wasn't even just our server that was less than stellar but every other server who was working. 7 servers walked by our table with plates stacked up and plates on other tables without cleaning them up. They clearly had their sections and that's all the cared about. I work in a restaurant and attitudes like that is a big reason why we probably had a less than enjoyable experience.

I received an email advertising a 6 pound wing special for the Mayweather fight, for $28. I thought this was a great deal and I placed my order online. About an hour later I received a call from a manager at BJ's wondering when I want at the wings?? Well let me think... The next day when the fight is going to begin like I put in my order? She proceeded to tell me that the order was already made due to their error in the system, basically my order was the fourth one done this way. So she update my order to reflect the next day at 5:30 for curbside pick up and apologized. They donated all the orders to EGPD. Fast forward to the next day, we arrived at 5:30 on the dot and pulled up to the curbside space. I called the phone number to request they bring out my order, I was advised it would be a few minutes. OK we can wait but when our wait turned into over 10 minutes I started to get frustrated in 104 degree weather. I gave it another five minutes and hobbled my butt into BJ's. I was so pissed and hot that I think I let a cuss word fly out and demanded to speak to the manager. I explained how could you make a order the day before but you can't make the order on time today? Also all these folks are sitting curbside in these heat, that's not good for us or our cars. She apologized and said they were a bit overwhelmed and gave me $30 in BJ's gift cards.

My husband and I both ordered the rib eye because the menu had so much going on that we figured they didn't do anything well and let's face it how can you screw up a ribeye. Especially one they felt they could charge 27.00 for. Well let me tell you, they did it. My husband's came first with the rest of the tables meals, myself and one other person in the party waited a full 15 minutes before our plates were delivered, which of course made everyone else's food cold because we are civilized and wait for everyone to be served before we eat. Back to the steak. It was ordered medium rare (both were) it came and it just looked dry. Not the kind of seared so it's juicy inside dry, but shoe leather dry (at this point I look at the ""loaded"" baked potato that consists of a slot with some cheese, sour cream and bacon bits shoved in it, it wasn't even cracked open just slit) he cut into it and it was this wierd dayglow red. But when you touched it it felt like a well done steak. It chewed like a well done steak, so the only thing that we can figure is that they must add some sort of food colouring to the meat. Mine was no better except the colour was a little more natural. We didn't eat 3 bites of it. The server never asked how it was and seeing how this was not our birthday celebration we didn't want to make a scene. However after shelling out what amounted to about 80.00 after tip for a meal we couldn't eat I thought maybe we should warn people off.  Seriously, maybe this place does something well but it ain't the meat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=140,2.56,2.8,2.992,2.18,2.704

27,Jason J.,"Sacramento, CA",239,143,194.0,2.0,2017-09-17,"I rarely ever write a bad review but my recent experience at BJ's was awful. It started once me and my family walked in. There were a several people waiting in front for a table, it was safe to assume the hostess was trying to figure out where they were going to accommodate them on the floor since it was a larger party, but all I ask is to be acknowledged. Luckily once everything was sorted out, she was able to take us to a table and apologized for the wait. Once we sat down, our server greets us a few minutes later. He grabs us water while we look through the menu, and everything seems like it's going pretty smoothly. Side note: we arrived at 11 with a movie at 12:10, which is down the street, and we already lurched tickets with assigned seating.  We put in our order a few minutes later and patiently waited. BJ's is notorious for the long wait for food, but I've accepted that and enjoy the food. I was looking looking around and realized that everyone was getting their beverages and food way before us and we sat down and ordered several minutes before. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and probably wouldn't have received it if I didn't remind our server, because I don't think it takes 30 minutes to make a cocktail. I honestly think our server forgot to input our order and it didn't help the situation that he was completely ignoring us. If the kitchen is backed up, or you forgot to put in our order - whatever - let us know what's going on! I've never walked out of a restaurant in my life, but that experience was not acceptable.

Both times I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and a Burger but had two very different experiences.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken: The first time, the chicken was cooked perfectly and came with a side of their lemon Chardonnay butter sauce to top it off with. The second time, the chicken was burnt and I couldn't even finish it because of the nasty burnt taste. Maybe if they had given me a side of the lemon Chardonnay sauce that it's supposed to come with but had forgotten to give me this time, I could have possibly covered up that nasty taste but it's not likely that it would have helped. Burger: We ordered a different burger both times and they were average. Again, both times the burger tasted burnt even though we requested they be cooked medium well.

192,Sonia S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,1,,1.0,2017-09-30,"If I could give a negative 5 for a review I definitely would. We came here for my graduation and after waiting 25 minutes my name was called for our table of 7. When I went to the host (Ashley) for my seat I was asked to wait another 5-10 minutes as they didn't have the menus /utensils ready. I waited and once my name was called again I was seated at a roomy, booth in the back near the mirrors. After my remaining party arrived we were asked by the waitress (Lindsay) if there was any way we could relocate to another booth as there was a person who had a reservation and it was their birthday and they sat at this particular booth every year. Out of kindness we were ok to move and Lindsay told us our appetizers and bazookies would be free for the inconvenience. It turned out to be a falsification that a party requested that booth for their birthday; this was said in order to get us to move because of an error made by the host (Ashley) of incorrectly seating us. On the way over to the other booth, my friend slipped and fell on the floor onto her back and hit her head on the floor. The wax on the restaurant floor was uneven and even those of us wearing flat shoes felt the floor was slippery. All the diners around were absolutely shocked yet no one came to even help. Not a single waitress came for at least 2-5 minutes (this is all on camera). We were told a manager (Morgan) would come by to take care of us. Morgan's attire matched that of the other waiters so we had no idea that she was a manager when she came to check on my friend. Morgan offered an ambulance, initially my friend declined because she wanted to try to sit down and see if she felt better. Immediately, Morgan came out with an incident report (we find out later that someone falls almost everyday at BJs), which probably explains the speediness of the incident report delivery. After about 15-20 minutes an ambulance was called to check on my friend because she felt dizzy and was in pain. The ambulance said the charges wouldn't be covered and that cost would need to be worked out with the restaurant. Another manager (Stuart) had came out to check on us and told us the cost of the ambulance would be covered. Mind you, we have another waitress (Kalani) by this time. Kalani asked us in an angry tone why we had called the manger over to our table and it had nothing to do with her, she wasn't aware of the fall as she was just handed our party as one of her tables to serve. Our new booth was crowded, in the dark and near the entrance and we deeply regretted agreeing to move tables. Once we told Kalani that our friend had fallen, she informed us that the waiters wear non slip shoes. When the ambulance arrived, the paramedic even commented that the floors are slippery. Kalani tried to serve us food while the ambulance was present and we asked For her to take it back as we are dealing with the paramedics. Once we rejected the food, Kalani gave our party a really dirty look and walked away with a really unprofessional attitude. Stuart (manager #2) came by again but argued that he was doing all that he could to take care of us and we expressed otherwise. Stuart himself told us that people slip and fall all the time here and I asked him how that was okay or acceptable and ""what if it was an old person - they would have probably fractured a bone."" Stuart also refused to pay for the few drinks we ordered  because he stated CA laws prohibited him from covering the cost of the drinks. We all wanted to split the bill and he said ""what a mess!"" and I spoke up. I told him that none of this was our fault , it was their fault for the unevenly waxed floors, and instead of making us feel like a burden, it's the company's responsibility to keep paying customers happy whether it's 1 card or 5 cards that we pay with. I also told him that his team lacks communication and synchronization as the host's mistake lead to the shifting of tables. We had to ask him for our vouchers for the bazookies and as he walked away he made a comment under his breath of ""Oh, God!"" This was an absolute disaster and the poorest, most uncoordinated customer service I've ever experienced at BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=220,2.52,2.72,2.932,1.956,2.64

32,Shelby C.,"Elk Grove, CA",453,18,33.0,5.0,2017-11-11,"Before reading my review, I want to give a disclaimer that I have been here so many times I've lost count. I've had both good, bad, and great experiences. Today was a GREAT experience. Today we came here to celebrate Veteran's Day. We were a party of 6 with 3 children (7, 8 & 13), 2 adults (myself and my boyfriend) and a senior (my boyfriends father). Both my boyfriend and his father served for our country, and seeing as though BJ's has had the ""Buy a Hero a Beer"" campaign along with today's Veteran's Day special, I thought it appropriate to bring him here because there is always something good on the menu for everyone. When we came here, I had initially called 1.5 hours before we arrived to put our family on the call ahead list. When we arrived however, we were NOT on the list. I initially got a little flustered and upset, because there was a lot of people waiting and I didn't want to make our family wait a tremendously long time. I showed the hostess my call log on my phone that showed my phone call to the restaurant, and the duration of the call so it shows I was on for a couple minutes. She went ahead and accommodated us and placed us on top of the wait list so that our wait time would cut in half. Fortunately, the wait ended up being even shorter. We were walked to our table and sat properly. The only thing that I should've suggested to the hostess was to try and find a table a little closer to the front so my boyfriends father wouldn't have to walk very far (he has trouble walking far distances or standing for long periods of time). As we were seated, we were greeted within about 30 seconds of sitting down by our server Kristiane J. She has served us before and was very sweet. She took our drink order immediately, and was patient even when myself and a couple of the kids were hesitant in placing our drink order. She came back with all of our drinks, which filled up an entire tray because my boyfriend and I asked for water on top of our beverages. I know how difficult and stressful it can be working in a busy restaurant and making a trip with a heavy tray. She also did great and remembering who got what drink, then kindly took our food order. My boyfriend and I ordered the boneless wing appetizer with the root beer glaze and Nashville hot sauce. Both were AMAZING, and the Nashville ones were AMAZINGLY PERFECT! I seriously love that flavor and so did my boyfriend. They were perfectly battered and filled with a good amount of white meat. I was extremely happy with this dish and look forward to having it again. For our entrees, my boyfriend and his father ordered the Mandarin Orange Porkchops, our oldest ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, and our 8 year old ordered the kids Mac and cheese with fries. I ordered the sirloin with asparagus and white cheddar mash potatoes. The food took a little while to come out, but not so long that we were getting upset or concerned. Our waitress did an amazing job updating us about the status of our food, and even triple checked when she walked by and noticed nobody and brought us our food yet. The only issue we had was with my sirloin, which I ordered medium-well. When it was first brought out, it was OVER well-done. We could tell immediately before I even cut it open. I was honestly not going to bother sending it back, because I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I know how sending food back can frustrate the flow of the restaurant or the servers and cooks. However, the food runner insisted I ""get what I am paying for"" and kindly took my dish back. When it was brought back out later by Kristiane, it was actually at a medium-rare level, and had to be sent back again. I FELT TERRIBLE and I told her that. She said no, please don't worry. You deserve to get what you paid for. She ran my food back, came back within a few minutes, and the steak was cooked was a good well-done level. I wasn't going to fuss anymore (I was hungry too), so even though I wanted a hint of pink it was still good enough that I could eat it (the first time it came out, the steak was extremely dry).  Kristiane also went out of her way to check for another promotion to honor my boyfriend and his father, in which vets receive a free dessert for having the BJs app on their phone. She also checked on our food regularly, refilled our drinks at the perfect time, and got us boxes so we could take leftovers home. While my son was boxing up his food, he dropped most of his fries on the floor and she insisted to get us some fresh fries to replace the ones he dropped. I was truly happy with her exceptional service, and it made for a great day especially to have a nice day out for Veterans Day with our two vets. I look forward to having her again as our server, and truly recommend Bfs for anyone because there is always something for anyone with their versatile menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=20,2.8,2.77,2.912,1.9400000000000002,2.782

The server took it back and came out about 20-25 minutes later with another plate of sliders and I should have expected this for sending it back, I PULLED A HAIR OUT OF MY MOUTH ON THE FIRST BITE I TOOK. Didn't eat the rest of my food, the server took I back, and I didn't get to eat after waiting for a total of probably an hour and I had to pay for this ""meal"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,2.0,2.64,2.78,,2.3840000000000003
10,A F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-29,"Went in for a quick bite around 8pm on 12/27/17 waited very long for my food was told almost 30 mins later by the waitress that my barbacoa tacos couldn't be made because they ran out of the ingredients(why did they take so long to tell me)???? to make matters worse the waitress still brought me the bill to pay for the drinks me and my gf ordered which should of been free to us as a courtesy due to their terrible service, I did not tip and I could of made a a rude remark but I am not that kind of person, I have had bad service in the past like overcooked or undercooked food but nothing  like this from BJs , this locations cooking abilities and services are decling which I have noticed over the years that I have been coming here, I will never return here again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,2.0,2.6,2.772,,2.3600000000000003
17,Francisca T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-30,"Worst service on pick up today! Used curbside, called n the lady said she will be right out. After 20 minutes I called back n I offered to come in and she said yes because they're busy. Went inside n the cashier looked at me funny when I said it's curbside pick up n I told her I've been waiting n I was told to come in. She grabbed my pizza and said the other cashier had to ring me up (wth) I had to wait till the other cashier came back from the back. And worst...the pizza was cold. Ordered online at 539, picked up at 629. Why offered the service when you can't do it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,1.84,2.6,2.76,,2.2960000000000003
1,Jef T.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,1,2.0,2.0,2017-12-31,"I ordered the Chef's special on the menu and enjoyed the meal very much. However, come to realize that once my credit card charge was processed, that the waitress charge me more than I indicated. I am very disappointed with the level of integrity displayed. I did not speak with management as I did not want the miss to loose her job. But the temptation of extra tips is certainly an unjust action.  In sum, be wary and pay with cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,1.76,2.58,2.764,,2.2520000000000002
22,Pamela T.,"Sacramento, CA",8,18,,2.0,2018-01-06,"Always giving this location the benefit of the doubt but they always seem to fail me. Especially the hostesses.  Every. Single. Time. No acknowledgment. Nothing. Today in particular, boy and girl flirting in front of the waiting line. Food always takes forever to come out. Server always takes forever to get to us as we wait to put our order in. Menus are always sticky. Get your shit together BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=20,1.8,2.55,2.768,,2.25
6,Shyelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",137,11,,1.0,2018-01-09,Had the worst service ever by Jacob. This waiter sucks. Not only is he super slow but he's rude. We ordered drinks and he was in another room eating pizza. Once our food came it was brought out by another lady and he didn't come check on our table once. Then at the end of our dinner we asked for drink refills boxes and he disappeared again. He finally came back to our table only to ask if we would like boxes. So he pretty much forgot about our refills too. I understand that when it's busy people can forget things and Im totally okay with that..but the restaurant was super slow today. When he gave us our check he threw it at our table. He was the worst waiter I've ever had and i will never return to this location thanks to him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,1.64,2.51,2.768,,2.162
4,Susan F.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,5.0,2018-01-12,"We continue to have great experiences at BJ's in Elk Grove on Laguna. Today we had Jacob M as our server! We were happy to see him as he has waited on us several times in the past. Jacob has one of the best personalities and is very attentive to every need that was part of our dining experience. The food was great, the atmosphere was clean and inviting and above all, Jacob was the best waiter!  BJ's is very fortunate to have such an exemplary employee working within their organization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove,1.8,2.51,2.784,,2.226
