635,Mel S.,"San Diego, CA",107,69,23.0,2.0,2012-01-12,"Terrible Service, Long wait to be seated even though we were staring at a ton of open tables.  This is the worst BJ's I've been to.  Granted: it was New Year's Day...but still.   Our server was this brown haired mid 30s d-bag w a screwy looking grill and who was full of unwanted and inappropriate comedy.  He spent way too much time cracking lame jokes and not enough time thinking about his job.  I.E. I was eyeing him down, he came to tell me he would be right with me and started walking away and I had to say loudly WAIT! Um PLEASE bring us some forks.  And he made a stupid joke about how it's kind of his whole job to bring food... and give people silverware.  Ya thanks buddy. Good thing you can always count on the soda - I have been daydreaming ever since this night of the delish homemade Black Cherry Soda. YUM.  And the Seared Ahi Salad.  The dabs of wasabi sauce, slices of fresh avocado, refreshing sweet tangy cucumber salad mixed in, fresh ginger, crsipy fried wonton strips on top, enough quality seared ahi to actually fill you up for $12.95 no wonder I never get anything else on this 200 item menu. Flatbread also never fails, buffalo or margherita YUMYUM.  The hubby never fails to get the pulled pork sandwich and he never walks away disappointed or hungry.  Sauce is great, pork is tender and comes with fries!  Saved ourselves from an extra 1000 calories and did not do a pizookie this time but definitely regretted it when I was walking out the door lol   Amazeballs - Im  now a big believer in the Black Cherry Soda - this comes from a serial water consumer-non soda drinker. Bummer -  Our server SUCKED.  But will remain unnamed bc I would feel bad if he lost his job his mom/roommate would probably never forgive him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=420,2.92,2.84,2.84,2.12,2.872

I strongly requested no cheese, got cheese and lip from the gal who brought the food, and I had to repeat ""no cheese please"" three times before she took it back. My friend ate, and ate and ate, while I waited.  And then I asked how much longer and she went back inside. It took longer for a re-make than the first one. She knew we were annoyed and then the manager came over - not at our request - and talked with us. I am not usually one who wants a freebie when there is an issue, but this one warranted something and we got zip, and we did not ask or get pissy when the bill came. She said she hoped we would come back....uh, no thank you.

366,Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",20,29,8.0,2.0,2012-02-13,"THE RESERVATION My friends and I had a reservation at 7 p.m. last Thursday night for 8 people.  I was the last one to arrive at 7:02, and the host handed me a buzzer for when our table was ready.  When I approached my friends, they were all confused as to why I was handed a buzzer because they were told that the table was in the process of being cleaned off and that we were going to be seated right away.  17 minutes later the buzzer went off, and we were seated.  So much for reservations! THE DRINKS They were sloooooooow with getting our drinks, and some of us just ordered water with lemon.  Well over 30 minutes after our reservation time, we finally got our waters without the lemon.  8 minutes later, our waitress brought out lemon slices for our water.   THE FOOD I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with blackened chicken, and when it got to the table, it was lukewarm.  The chicken breast was dry and overcooked, probably because it was a small thin piece of meat equivalent to 4 Chicken McNuggets at McDonalds.  The pasta did not have enough sauce, so it was lacking in flavor.  The dish was totally not worth $14+.  On top of my whack dish, I think our waitress forgot to offer us soup or salad for our entrees.  (After deciding on what I wanted to eat, I had given my menu to my friend who didn't have a menu, so I wasn't 100% sure if soup or salad came with the entrees, but I'm pretty sure it did.  Of course I didn't realize this until after we left!  Oh well...I didn't need the extra food anyways!) THE SERVICE I assign the service a double S...Slow and Sucky!  I didn't bother to complain because the manager was the one who seated us, and he didn't offer an apology...so why bother complaining about the rest of the dining experience?  He clearly didn't care and/or felt that ignoring the screw-up was best. THE COMPANY I always enjoy hanging out with my friends, so the dinner was worth it just to see all of them!  I'll give this place an extra star just because I enjoyed my friends' company. THE VERDICT I'll only be back if this is where my friends want to meet, but I will definitely bring my own bottled water and eat beforehand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=400,2.72,2.83,2.83,2.184,2.7860000000000005

624,Diane P.,"Escondido, CA",7,80,3.0,2.0,2012-02-22,"Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages, I can't comment on their vast beer, ale or wine offerings. (Half the menu.) However, I've eaten there twice and found it wanting. I don't even remember what I had the first time. Last Friday: chicken lettuce cups (meh) and the ""giant stuffed baked potato"" with their chili. The potato is giant (I split it with a friend), I'll give them that. But stuffed? I was merely sliced down the middle with a schmeer of chili and some cheddar cheese melted over the top with a dollop of sour cream. There was a teeny little dish of extra chili on the side. We asked for extra chili, and got about a cup's worth; still there was a LOT of plain potato to choke down.  We sat inside, rather than outside with heat lamps and the inevitable, random wafts of cigarette smoke. Inside the lighting was so dim we could hardly read the menus and the music so loud we could barely hear one another.  I told the waitress I'm gluten intolerant, but the gluten-free, thin crust, cheese-only pizza for $9.25 (with each additional toppings $1) didn't appeal to me. (It would be nice if they just offered the GF crust as an option with all their specialty pizzas.)  The waitress offerd to bring me a ""gluten-free menu,"" but instead it turned out to be their entire food menu reprinted in very tiny font in the form of a chart, cross-referencing every common food allergen. It didn't say whether the black dot in the coordinating square meant that the menu item contained or was free of the allergen indicated. So, since I forgot to bring my magnifying-glass-flashlight, I just opted for what I thought would be safe off the regular menu. Hence the Lettuce Cups, which were sprinkled with fried won tons (gluten) and the giant non-stuffed tuber. Lettuce Cups (appetizer) + Giant Chili-""stuffed"" Potato + mini Gluten-free Pizooki = $24.

663,Winnie L.,"San Diego, CA",35,118,54.0,2.0,2012-03-15,"Your RESERVATION policy is awful. The call ahead is a total sham. The alleged premise is you call in your party ahead of time and get priority seating when you arrive. The guy who answered told me that as soon as I arrive, check in with the hostess and it would be a 10 mins wait. As soon as I arrived, the hostess said 25 mins. I didn't bother arguing with her about the false advertisement, but 30 mins later I realized that this whole thing is a joke.  I approached the hostess and she told me that it would be another 5-10 mins. I told her that when I called her coworker told me 10 mins and now its been triple the time. She apologized and said that they are waiting for tables to clear and that the guy answering the phone has no.idea what's happening out here. I responded, ""then someone needs to tell him not to give wrong information over the phone because I came here under the impression it would be a short wait."" The hostess apologized again and said that they have a lot of people and that there were other callers too. I know its not her fault, but if I really wanted to, I could've totally continued on that debate with her that its essentially not my fault I was given wrong info and her managers should enforce their supposedly great call in policy more true to what it advertises. However, she should have offered to speak with her coworkers about giving wrong info. Instead, she made excuses.

537,AJ Q.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,2012-06-21,"I normally don't write reviews, but I feel strongly that I should warn any potential customers. I live nearby BJ's Escondido and have given it a fair chance too many times. I have ordered at least 1x month since it opened using Curbside To Go. The staff doesn't care what time they quote the pickup time on their website. Be prepared to wait 15+ minutes extra. I have even had to wait upwards of 45 minutes and I was the only car in the Curbside To Go area. After all the waiting, you would think that my order would be correct- No, NEVER! I have even called the manager to complain and  they blame their staff and claim they have training issues. The last time I spoke with the Manager, she offered to send me some coupons if I came back- No they never arrived. Bad management usually leads to under performing staff. Against my better judgment, I ordered Curbside To Go again tonight. It was late (9:45 PM), but the BJ's website accepted my order. I show up to BJ's and no one picks up the Curbside phone. The staff is hanging out in front of BJ's and no one cares that there is a customer-- a paying customer waiting to pay. I finally get someone to pickup the regular phone and when I complain and ask to speak to a manager, she hangs up on me. I call back and speak to the manager and he tells me Curbside To Go closes at  9 pm for staff safety-- the same staff that is hanging out outside BJ's. He did offer to walk my order accompanied by his staff when I stated that I could not walk up the ramp due to a disability, but by then I was thoroughly disgusted.

I stopped in here on Saturday after visiting the Wild Animal Park, and it was pretty slow.  Of course it was 4:00 in the afternoon, so I wasn't too surprised.  That said, the service was excellent!  I know lots of people have complained about the service, and maybe we were just lucky, but I was impressed by the attention and care shown to us.  We were there with a couple small children, and they brought us crayons, oyster crackers, goldfish crackers, and kids cups, without barely a word.  Very thoughtful! As none of us were very hungry, we didn't order entrees or appetizers, but were intrigued by the variety of soups they offered.  So one of our party asked if there was a soup/salad buffet on the menu, and our server immediately said, ""Well, there is, but it's a lunch special, and we don't offer those on the weekends... but I can make it happen for you.""  So awesome! So yeah, we all had soup and salad.  The house salad was a house salad... nothing special.  The dressing was good, the lettuce crisp... what else do you want?  I ordered the Cherry soda, and was very happy with it.  Plus free refills!  Excellent!  After one glass of the Black Cherry, though, I wanted to try the Orange Cream.  It was just okay, the Cherry was definitely better, IMO... The soups, on the other hand... Amazing!  The clam chowder was one of the best clam chowders I've ever had!  Thick, Rich, Clammy!  Yumm!!!  The tortilla soup was also excellent!  Very good flavors, nice chunks of chicken, I wanted to just put it in a glass and drink it down.  Plus I'm a sucker for fresh avocado, which was part of the presentation of the tortilla soup.  EXCELLENT! As we finished up, I started getting past the ""full"" feeling, and belatedly asked our waiter if he could get me another bowl of clam chowder (it was THAT good), and he apologized, saying that he had just closed our ticket and our bill, and there was no way for him to ring it in.  I told him never mind, that it was okay, but he told me to hold on a minute.  Sure enough, a couple minutes later, he brought me more!  Awesome!  He got an extra big tip for that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=600,2.36,2.76,2.76,2.868,2.6

He refills two ice teas and that's the last we ever saw of him. Approximately 90 minutes after first getting there our orders were taken. Approximately 35 minutes after that our food arrives. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It was extremely dry and well done...not the medium as advertised. The Jambalaya had whole tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce usually associated with this type meal. The rest of the meals were less than spectacular to midiocre at best. The highlight was the conversation and seeing old faces....but this could have been done at the local park.

Their watermelon feta salad is also to-die-for, great to have on a hot summer day. I love their flatbreads too, though I haven't tried all of them yet.  AND lunch specials are all under $10. Pretty good if you ask me! Also, try their pizookies. You will not be disappointed.

I didn't really want a garlic burger.  The wedge-cut fries were fine, but didn't taste very fresh.  I had the red velvet pizookie for dessert... best part of the meal by a lot.  The service was all right I suppose.  Everybody's food came out quickly except for my wife's.  For whatever reason, hers came out nearly 10 minutes after everybody else's... all she got was the broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl.  How hard is that?  Hollow out bread, pour soup in bread and serve!  Strange.  Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes and food quality.   Overall, it's not terrible, but it really isn't worth the hype either.  I'll come back, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=400,2.6,2.75,2.75,2.476,2.6900000000000004

The table was still dirty when they seated us. They wiped it as we stood there waiting. Our drinks took forever to come, and our waitress ended shift mid order and we had a new waiter. He was nice. I have food allergies and was very specific about my order. Dressing on the side, add a side of BBQ sauce. The order came and the side of dressing was missing as was the BBQ sauce. Frustrating. My son also wanted extra dressing and they only brought one, gave it to my son, then later after I asked AGAIN brought mine. My chicken in my cesar salad was undercooked and slimy. I asked for new chicken. Some of the lettuce in the bottom of my bowl looked like black slime. It was just so gross. The place is noisy, the waiters are pleasant but forgetful, and the lemonade tasted very acidic like a sour drink mix. Nasty. Their chicken is very moist, still bordering on slimy even well done.

The avocado egg rolls were cut very poorly. Whoever cut it must not have been paying attention, half of the rolls were tiny bite sizes and the other half were three times the bite size. The avocado egg rolls seem to have shrank in size big time. The sliders were dry and overcooked. It lacked flavor and the beef was tiny. Our server seemed to have been missing a majority of the time.

204,Heather L.,"Beckenham, London, United Kingdom",211,1018,262.0,3.0,2012-09-16,"A couple nights before my mom and I had lunch here, my aunt had suggested this place because we were planning on going to the mall and we all started giggling.  [insert pervy joke] here.  Fast forward to my mom picking me up after my shift at the mall and she asked if I wanted to go here for lunch.  We had never been, so I said sure. The inside is really nice and it is quite loud, so for those of you guys taking girls out on dates where you would like to get to know them and actually talk to them, I don't think this is the place... then again if it is already an awkward night out, then by all means, go here then you can both avoid talking to each other and watch t.v. as they have them all over the place.  Anyway we had to wait for a table, which I thought was a bit strange given it was almost 2 p.m. on a weekday...  and there were about 3-4 parties waiting. The hostess was friendly in seating us.  It took quite awhile for a waitress to come over and take our drink order... in fact it took so long we had already decided on our starter and our mains.  Our stuffed mushrooms came out and so did some plates, but like some other reviewers, we did not have utensils, so the waitress, upon request, went over to another table and stole the utensils off of the table.  There was no refill offered for my empty glass... actually our waitress wasn't around very often.  I thought it had to do with the large group next to us... including the store manager and district manager for the store I work for... but she wasn't serving them, so I can't figure out why she was never around. The stuffed mushrooms may have been the best part of the meal... should've ordered more of those.  Both my mom and I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos... she got both grilled and I got one grilled, one fried.  A different waiter brought out our food, still no refill on the drink.  The tacos certainly looked lovely!  They serve them with nice warm tortilla chips... mine were really good, but my mom's chips were stale!  They serve them with square containers of avocado cream and salsa... wasn't a fan of the salsa, but the avocado cream was nice. The tacos... my mom said hers tasted a bit funny, and my fried one tasted a bit funny... not sure how to describe the taste, but my grilled taco was actually ok... just not much fish at all.  And I do love cabbage/slaw on my fish tacos, but I got all of the thick, hard, bitter parts of the cabbage.  I think by the time I pulled all of those pieces out, there wasn't much garnish left on the taco :/ (maybe this speaks to the fact about how often my mind is in the gutter... but [insert pervy joke here]).  To be honest, I think I'd be willing to give the food another go, but with the service, I'm not sure that I would go out of my way or suggest it when someone asks, ""Where should we go for dinner?""  The lunch prices... well there are some items under $10, but I would say most items on the menu are over $10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=260,2.48,2.71,2.71,2.508,2.6180000000000003

270,Alaok D.,"San Diego, CA",1,75,,2.0,2013-02-05,"I'm sad to say that my earlier 5 star rating has been lowered to two stars based on recent visits. Both were essentially the same problem, but I will relate what happened on my most recent visit, Saturday, Feb. 2. We called ahead for seating which is a great thing - when it works. We arrived at 5 PM, and were told it was to be a 20 minute wait even after calling in. WTF? We were seated 30 minutes later. OK, they blew it on that one. We had a very pleasant server, none of what ensued was her fault. My wife ordered pasta of some sort, I ordered a NY steak, my daughter and fiance shared a pizza. Three of us got salads. IT TOOK 30 FLIPPING MINUTES TO BRING THE DAMN SALADS. So we ate them, and the entrees came. Well, some of them did, my steak was MIA. The server was apologetic, she said the manager was aware of the problem. It took at least 15 minutes to get my steak, which tasted great. The other three at the table also enjoyed watching me eat it since they were mostly done with their dinners. My daughter and fiance shared a dessert, my wife got the complimentary one for her birthday. I didn't need one, I was still eating my entree.  When the server presented the check, we had been comped the dessert. The manager had failed to make an appearance at our table, so I asked to speak to her. She was indifferent to the problem, only saying that she ""had heard something about it"". I proceeded to tell her about the failure of the call ahead seating thing, the 30 minute wait for salads after ordering and the botched steak dinner, and the only reply she had was ""uh, we were busy"". She did eventually offer an apology and comped the botched steak dinner, but I don't think I should have had to unload on her to get this concession. I don't like having to do things like that.   A similar incident happened a couple of months earlier, this time a pizza my daughter and fiance ordered arrived well before the other entrees arrived. This same manager was about as interested, as contrasted to the manager that I referenced in my original review, he was great. The sad thing here is that we all love BJ's food, but the system can't seem to get the food out of the kitchen and to the table.  Just for the record, this is the first time in my lifetime of dining out that I have ever had to ask to speak to a manager, I am not a chronic complainer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=340,2.8,2.76,2.76,2.216,2.776

My mom and sister ordered the pasta with marinara sauce, and they put the wrong sauce (spicy marinara instead of regular marinara). My mom cannot eat spicy foods, and asked for a new dish.

One time we were sat at a table with no condiments or silverware and we had to ask for some when the server came back to check about how our food was. The food always takes what seems like an excessive amount of time. Other times the food runners would bring the wrong dishes, drinks go unfilled, missing silverware. On one visit, the manager was just strolling around while our credit card sat on the table for a good 20 minutes before the server came by to pick it up. That's been the only constant, waiting to close out.

Last time the wrong beer was brought for my fiance by a runner, and the bartender came over and said ""wrong beer, bud"" and grabbed it away like my fiance had picked up the wrong one. On that same visit, the entrees came before the appetizers, and the pizza was undercooked. If I didn't like their small bites menu (fried artichokes...mmmmm) so much, we would never go back. I wish I could experience just one visit where nothing went wrong. Oh well, maybe I'll just do orders for pick up from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=600,2.76,2.7,2.7,2.44,2.724

My visit to this location in Escondido didn't fit the bill.  The grilled chicken baked potato was severely undercooked. We asked for it to be replaced, which they did, but it took over 15 mins for us to flag down our server. I had to ask the hostess to find him and send him our way. By the time it came back the rest of our party had finished with their meals so that person rushed to eat the new potato, which was also undercooked, but at that point it wasn't worth sending it back. I needed a drink refill and the server failed to notice my empty glass at the end of the table and even after I asked for a refill the server came back twice without my drink. The location wasn't overly busy, so I wasn't sure why we had all the delays.  I tried the new BBQ slider and chicken breast and it was mediocre at best. The only saving grace was the pizookie, which would be nearly impossible to screw up. Maybe it was just an off day, or who knows.

Typically, waiters and waitresses would tell us to take our time and whenever we are ready when they would give us the check. And also, the check is usually delivered after asking the customer if they need anything else and at the end of the meal.

463,Ryan C.,"Escondido, CA",27,19,,2.0,2013-09-01,"This place is a bit of a gamble lately.  I suspect it's a staffing problem, mostly focused on the management.  It's completely possible that there are other staffing problems (or particular individuals); however, based on the other reviews here on Yelp plus my own experiences I think the root cause is with the management team. In our most recent experience, my family was seated almost immediately.  I asked the hostess to change the closest TV to the only live sports event (NASCAR, in this case) since it was playing a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  The host was happy to accommodate, and mentioned that she would ask her manager to change the channel.  Our server got to us quickly, and we ordered an app and  drinks (including drinks from the bar)--they came out quickly as well, and the drinks had the touch of an excellent bartender.  It took about 5 minutes or so before our server got back to us (she was relatively busy), and we ordered our food.  I asked her to see about getting the closest TV changed, too--just in case the hostess dropped the ball and didn't pass the request on to the manager. Skipping forward over 30 minutes, and I'm still looking at a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  It's clearly not the worst of all crimes, but it's unlikely that both the hostess and the server failed to notify a manager.  All the tables near us changed over, too, so it's not like anyone was actively winning/losing money on these ponies. So what's the big deal about the TV, you say?  It probably wouldn't be a problem, except we still didn't have our food.  Another 15 minutes pass, and our server comes by to say that our food should be up any minute.  Something is wrong in the kitchen, I guess.  A few minutes later, a manager arrives and tells us that the ticket got lost somehow, and all our food is being remade and should be out immediately.  We understand these things can happen, so okay. First out is my food, and one kid's.  His is fine, mine clearly was sitting around for a while--the plate was hot, but the food was cold.  I sent mine back as more of the food showed up.  The kids' food was clearly hot and fresh; however, my wife's food had also been sitting around for a while--the chicken was cooled down but the celery was warmed up (heat lamp).  She opted to just eat rather than send it back, too.  Shortly after, the rest of the food arrived (minus mine, since it was going to take about 10 minutes to remake). Sometime, while my food was being remade, the TV in front of me changed to the NASCAR race.  So that was something, which was nice. When my food arrived, it was hot.  It wasn't the best, but I'd give it a passing grade: the kitchen was in a hurry to get it out and make sure it was hot.  They succeeded, but it wasn't impressive.  Maybe I was just bitter by then, but I try to keep my own bad attitude out of the ratings (where possible, of course!). So, lots of apologies from the server.  It wasn't her fault, and she was nearly in tears over everything.  I can't blame her.  It's her tip on the line, and if the leadership and kitchen can't get their acts together it's causing her to lose out on money.  I certainly wouldn't put up with that situation for long--there are other restaurants looking for motivated and qualified serving staff. At the end, a different manager stopped by and talked about the bill.  He comped us for ""about half"" of the bill.  It's appreciated that they recognized the screw-ups (well, I don't think the TV thing was ever acknowledged, but I didn't point it out, either), and that they want us to return, and really at that immediate moment about the only thing management can do is comp some of the bill.  Based on the other reviews for this location, I wonder how often they are screwing things up with others.  Even if I get a free meal every couple/few times I return, it won't convince me that I should come back very often.  Instead, I'd much prefer the leadership focus on the issues, get them resolved, and start to enjoy better profits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=540,2.64,2.6,2.6,2.472,2.616

I love the atmosphere of this place and it just a great overall fun family friendly restaurant.  I came here to put my name down since Friday nights cane get a little crazy with the wait and after waiting about 30 minutes, I decided to check in to see how much longer, since I didn't get a pager at all. I was told that it would be a few short minutes and our table would be ready.... well, a few short minutes turned into another 20 minutes and the servers didn't apologize for anything or saying sorry for the wait that we they didn't know how to calculate or anything. This greatly brought concern and just that this part of the restaurant (who is the face since that is who I see first) just doesn't care at all.  Our server Natalie was a joy!!! She was so friendly and timely with our drinks when we sat down. Always had another refill for us ready to go even though we were there at the peek dinner rush time. She never stopped smiling and was always so happy!!! We ordered our drinks and then placed our food order. It seemed like she had a big party too but she still came in and checked in our table to make sure we were doing ok, and ensured to us that our food would be coming shortly. Sure enough, our food was at our table. This is what separates Natalie apart from other servers... SHE WAITED TILL WE WERE DONE CHEWING AND TAKING A BITE TILL SHE ASKED US HOW OUR FOOD WAS!!!!! THANK YOU!!!! You do not how inconvenient it is when people are just there and you've taking your first bite and they ask you how your food is, or they ask you how it is seconds after the food runner has just put down the plates.

I usually shy away from places that provide such large menus. I feel like there's no specialty item. The menu goes from Asian chicken wontons to bison burgers to pastas to pizzas (flatbread and deep dish) to Moroccan spiced salmon to fish and chips to giant baked potatoes and the list goes on and on....for about 20 pages. It's kind of overwhelming. My biggest complaint is that the water tastes like it came straight out of the sewage. On multiple occasions, I've had to order a flavored beverage to avoid the water. The ""gourmet mac and cheese"" used to be really good. It actually tasted gourmet, with thick stretchy cheese and a delightful sprinkling of bread crumbs. Tonight, it looked like soup at the bottom. It was supposed to have bacon crumbs on top, and what we got looked like one strip of bacon ripped into 5 pieces.  Also, when did Goldfish (the fish-shaped cheesy snacks) belong in mac and cheese? The last few times I've ordered the pasta, my boyfriend and I asked if we could split it. Twice, they've said yes; and twice they've said no. Consistency is key!!!! Sometimes the pasta is cooked al dente, other times it isn't. Sometimes they give two pieces of bread, sometimes it's one. Though minor offenses, I can only wonder what other things they're inconsistent with. They sure are consistent with water quality being poor!! The pizookies are always great, though. I'll give them that.  Also, the beer selection is great (as I hope it would be for calling itself a ""Brewhouse"").

We asked the waiter to take it back and dispose of it.  We also had the Ahi Poke.  The Ahi was better than that served on the salad, but not top quality to be served raw.  With some dressing it was edible.  The thin cut fries and calamari were fine, but very greasy.  Both should be served on a paper doily to sop up some of the oil.

I liked the pine nuts in it, but other than that I felt like it was under seasoned sauce. -1/2 cobb sandwich with fries and salad: I liked the cobb sandwich a lot, although it was greasier than expected when holding the sandwich. I do recommend trying it though! It's a great deal with fries and a side salad! -BJ's Hefeweizen: I'm not a light beer fan really, but my friend said she liked it a lot. -BJ's double IPA: it was part of the 3.50 which was nice.. but I only got 12 ounces for that price instead of the regular size. In general, it was good, but nothing spectacular. I asked to sample the double ipa and either the stout or porter (I love both and I can't remember which) to decide between the two. I was a little annoyed by what the server brought.. both samples were in hot glasses so I basically tasted lukewarm beer and had to decide from that which I liked more.

I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Ahi Poke which was really good. I took bites of the stuffed mushrooms, the jalapeño burger & a few others. Everything was delish! I came here as our 2nd choice restaurant for a quick late dinner after shopping at North County Fair (there was a 40 minute wait at Cheesecake Factory). This time I ordered the Brewhouse Burger with bacon, cheese & avocado plus the Crispy Calamari as an appetizer. I don't know why I ordered such basic stuff there when I can get that anywhere but that's what I craved; a nice juicy burger. Calamari came out, eh, it was ok, not the greatest but not the best either. Burger came out a minute later & that was ok too. Thin slices of avocado; not sure if/how much I was charged for that but I was expecting thicker chunks (I love avocado!). Beef wasn't that juicy & the seasoned fries that came with my meal were dry & lacked flavor. They tasted like they were fried earlier that day & then been re-fried to be warmed up. Not cool. McDonald's has fresher fries & burgers which is sad. I took a bite of my boyfriend's roast beef dip & the au jus was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, dinner was alright.

I think the problem with that location is the ditzy morons they hired as hostesses and waitresses don't care if the place makes money, builds customer loyalty, or even stays in business.  daddy's paying all their bills, right? it's too bad, because their food is really good - but the service is so bad it's rarely worth the headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=480,2.48,2.69,2.72,2.244,2.606

They also offer you to add to your program to get suggestions on beers to go with your meals as well. One thing that I feel is a little pointless is their call ahead system. You can call ahead of time to put your name down, but they don't add you to the line until you arrive at the restaurant. There's really no difference in wait time if you call a head or not.

We never sat at the bar, since the bar wouldn't accommodate the amount of food that we would order. Sometimes several plates or appetizers, and sometimes we would be really hungry and order meals along with drinks. One thing that keeps me coming back to BJ's is their Top Shelf Margaritas...upgraded with Patron of course! The bartenders at BJ's make the Top Shelf Margaritas PERFECT here; the perfect balance of citrusy/sour, good kick of tequila (not overbearing at all!), and ice. Yes, they didn't overdo it on the ice - how is that possible? Their Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini, is pretty good; but watch out, sometimes the bartenders will pour this little martini strong, rendering it impossible for either Anthony and I to finish it. And we usually like our drinks with a nice kick to them! Also the beers are very good here! The Hefeweizen is yummy with a slice of lemon, and so is the Jeremiah Red! As far as food is concerned, I haven't explored their menu in it's entirety because it's HUGE. I wouldn't consider it a menu even, a pamphlet would be more appropriate. Anyways I'm a creature of habit, so I stick with what I like and familiar with. I always enjoy the Caprese Salad, Ahi Poke, and Calamari as appetizers. For entrees I enjoy the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, Roast Beef Dip sandwich, and Lemon Thyme Chicken. The portions are always gargantuan, and I always have leftovers to take home. Makes for a yummy, substantial lunch at work! And what is a review for BJ's without mentioning their coveted pizookies? The Red Velvet one is me and Anthony's favorite. The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut pizookie is really good, and so is the Baked Beignet. I'm not too fond of the Double Chocolate or the Cookies N Cream pizookies - WAY TOO SWEET for my liking! And honestly, I rarely have any room to indulge in these because I'm always substantially full, and I don't like overstuffing myself. Since then I've learned to just come here for solely for the pizookie! No more, no less, and very enjoyable.

You'd have to be a 'brewery' to do that.  The beer is actually decent, but, like the food, doesn't really take any chances. With the dizzying array of menu options, one has to wonder about freezer drawers in the kitchen. But you accepted all that before you came thru the door. Decor is incredible. 'East- Coast-High-End-Hotel Lobby-meets Waldorf Astoria vibe. The urinals are actually pretty cool too. Kind of a waterfall-to-the-floor type engineering to reduce spatter. So there's always that.

I honestly don't have anything bad to say other than I wish our pizza was cut better, it just wasn't cut through all the way and was hard to separate the slices. Other than that it was great. Service was great an even when our waitress was about to take her break, she came over and introduced the girl that would be covering for her until he got back. I am a huge fan of cider beer and they had a few options which makes me super happy, as well as Mojitos! We had 2 apps, 4 beers, and an 11"" personal pizza and our bill was only $32!

110,Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",916,1167,5947.0,3.0,2014-04-16,"My best friend Kendra wanted to meet up this past Monday night to catch up, and as she lives near the area, she suggested BJ's.  While I had been burned by a past experience at the location near my girlfriend's place (here's my review:  ), I figured I'd give this location the benefit of the doubt. We started with an order of the calamari - this was quite tasty, what with the lightly breaded tentacles and rings along with the marinara and aioli sauces.  I could easily have polished off the appetizer on my own... fortunately Kendra was there to help out! Kendra ordered a mini Great White pizza: made with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast, this looked rather delicious, though she couldn't finish it. Meanwhile, I had gone with one of BJ's Enlightened entrees (both for the under 795 calorie count and the prices; most of the menu is rather overpriced, in my opinon) - their Barbecue Bison Burger.  This was made with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned and grilled (mine was medium well), then topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo, then served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce.  It's also served alongside a tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinagrette and topped with green onions.  Surprisingly, this wasn't too bad - I've had buffalo burgers before, so I was used to the taste, and in fact I put the slaw in the burger to give it a little extra oomph. The venue itself is pretty roomy and clean, and the servers were quite attentive while we were there.  Also, BJ's has a revolving glass door... which I nearly bumped into while going inside. Not too bad overall, though those prices could be a bit more affordable.  Still, I can see myself coming back to this location for a happy ending - a happy ending in this case being a Pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140,2.68,2.66,2.74,2.38,2.668

I didn't enjoy the angel hair classico I got so I exchanged it for the flatbread pizza. It took FOREVER for me to get my flatbread. it took so long, I asked our waitress to put it in a to-go box because I wasn't even hungry anymore. And when I did get it, it tasted weird. Then we ordered two beignets to-go. Both came out and weren't in to-go containers. Also they weren't even beignets, they were cinnamon donuts. don't call something a beignet if that's not what it's going to be! Then we told the manager and the only thing he did was pay for the desserts. He should have done a lot more than that. Then at the end our waitress brought out a beignet to-go on the house. We didn't ask for that beignet. If we were going to have a free dessert we would have rather had a pizzoki. I definitely am going to think twice before going to BJ's again.

After a semi-long drive from Palm Springs, we decided this would be our late night dinner stop. We were hungry after an early grad party and after doing some damage at the outlet. Since it was my birthday I was able to choose between here and Cheesecake Factory. I stupidly chose BJ's since I was comparing it to my favorite Hazard Center location.  So like I said, it was my birthday. I walked in with a McFlurry since I wanted dessert before dinner and because when it's your birthday, you can do whatever you please! Duh! I basically greeted the hostess myself since I was immediately judged. I apologized for having it, but she pretended to understand after rolling her eyes at me. She then proceeded to walk us to a dirty ass booth. I wiped the booth down as she watched. When I finished wiping the other side, she grabbed a WET towel and wiped the side I was going to sit at and didn't tell me. I was in shorts so it surprised me and she laughed. It was not funny and I made sure she knew that. A few minutes later our waitress came. No smile, no welcome to BJ's, no anything. I can't even tell you her name since she didn't introduce herself. We ordered our food. I got a mini BJ's favorite, my friend got the California Burger, someone else got chicken wings, and I think my other friend got some kind of breaded chicken dinner. We also all got salads. The salads came out quickly and then it took over 25 minutes to get our COLD food. I mean COLD! My pizza was even a little doughy. I asked for no sausage on my pizza and still got it on there. Our waitress was never to be found for refills or to ask how we were doing. We ate our food since we were practically starving. Then the lady came out of no where and these were her words ""I'm sorry I'm not feeling well. I have a bad migraine. Seth will be closing you out"". Um what? Who the eff and Seth and who the hell are you?!?! Seth did come eventually and to only close us out. We ordered a birthday pizookie with the manager and didn't get it until we finished paying our bill. I mean seriously, the worst service and some of the worst food I have tasted.

The moment we sat down, the waitress was pushing us to sign up for the new BJ's iPhone app. We were not sure if she had incentives for doing so, but it sure felt that way. The waitress told us that we would receive $5 off our bill if we signed up so we went ahead and did so. When we were ready to pay the bill, she explained we only get $5 off if we pay on the mobile app and showed us an advertising that indicated you needed to pay via the phone. I looked at the ad and it said that a minimum of $20 needed to be spent to receive $5 off. We were splitting the bill and each bill was just under $20. So, I made a point of saying, I do not think that it will give me $5 off since it will be under $20. and indicated that I would prefer to just pay with my credit card and not worry about the $5 off. The waitress insisted I try paying via the app and said if it does not work, she will give me $5 back another way. So, I paid via the app and as I expected, no $5 off. I am finally getting to the worst part of the story. The waitress asked the manager what to do and the manager stopped by our table. She could have offered us $5 cash, a free desert, anything customer oriented. Instead she pulls out a coupon and says that she has ""left over fathers day coupons for $5 off our next visit that are still good"" and she handed me the coupon. I could not believe she even said that it was a left over fathers day coupon. And the coupon was about to expire in a week.

For entrees, we ordered the Great White, the Mediterranean, the BBQ Chicken...and another deep dish that obviously wasn't memorable. My (unexpected) fave was the Mediterranean so I'm glad I ordered it- loved the huge chunks of feta embedded in peperoncinis and olives.  Despite the long-awaited, gustatory satisfaction of BJ's deep dish pizzas, I bumped my rating to 3 stars because our initial order of the party platter pazookie came out raw! We talked to the waiter, who disagreed with us, but his manager immediately acknowledged the cookie dough was raw, apologized, and ordered another pazookie.

I put my name on the list even though it didn't sound like it would help any. The lady on the phone told me to come 20 minutes ahead of time to ensure getting a table at 1:00. What do you know, we show up at 12:40 and are told it will be a 40 minute wait. Awesome! My family with small children were forced to wait by the front door in the heat for a table. I asked the hostess again about reservations, since I thought it was ridiculous that they don't do them, and she said they do do reservations but you have to make them a day in advance or call early in the morning.

The manager arrived promptly and listen to our concerns.  He appologized and said he would find out what happened.  He never did return.  The second waitress said my manager took off the apps for the inconvenience.   Listen up manager.  BJs should not be a 2 and a half star restaurant.  If you want to improve your image it needs to start with you.  Start caring for the people that give you honest feedback and pretend that you give a damn.  Personnaly go back and hand the check to your customers.  This only takes a minute and goes along way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=240,2.44,2.63,2.708,2.18,2.5540000000000003

In fact, I didn't see any waiters or waitresses. To top it all off, when we finally got our food (40 minutes after ordering) it was cold. This tells me our food was ready well before we received it.

I was served the salad and had no utelsils whatsoever with which to eat it. The rumors are true, I am afraid. The simple act of keeping this establishment staffed seems to be a complete failure of the management. The eyes of the waitresses and waiters are filled with despair and stress. It is a very simple matter of under staffing.  I understand that bjs is a business which must remain profitable, but when both the employees and clients have a poor time due to what I can only deem to be management failures, then everybody loses.  As usual, the food remains fine and tasty. Also, the choice of television program is amiable, as it is holiday bowl time.  Overall experience: one half point out of five. Taste and presentation of food, four points out of five.  Overall, 1.5 points out of five. Sorry, but you need to fix a lot of issues from the management.

Poor service aside, the food was great and the location was clean and very well maintained.  We had the calamari for the appetizer.  This crispy treat was served with both marinara and tartar sauce.  For the entrée, I had the parmesan crusted chicken.  The chicken was sliced thin and lightly crusted with parmesan.  The flavor was amazing.  This was served on top of hearty mashed potatoes; a perfect pairing.  My girlfriend had the jambalaya which was also delicious.  It was a big bowl of southern goodness.  The shrimp, sausage, rice, and spices were very fresh.  These 3 dishes are highly recommended.  Finally, we had 3 pizookies: chocolate, white chocolate macadamia, and oreo.  The chocolate was a little too sweet for my taste.  The white chocolate and oreo are my favorite and they are a must have!

There is plenty of parking as you can imagine so parking should never be a problem even at rush hour.

Our waiter even took our picture when he saw our group failing miserably at attempting to take a selfie... Well a groupie lol. Reason Why I'm NOT giving a full 5 stars is because as it was packed...it was incredibly hot and stuffy. My shrimp scampi was a large portion but was not a true scampi sauce and there wasn't much sauce at all. It was a little bland. The copious amounts of parmesan cheese saved it. Took awhile to get someone to take our drink order. Lastly, the spinach /artichoke dip was horrible. Flavor -less and not spinach or artichoke.  The Pizookies were delicious and the atmosphere was nice. We had a great time and everyone around us appeared to be having a great time as well.

193,Joel C.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,90,16.0,3.0,2015-04-19,"Overall a good restaurant if you go early and get good waiters, etc. and one of the best BJs locations I've been to. There are some inconsistencies though: the waiters don't seat you well (next to loud people when the restaurant is empty otherwise), they play the most boring and bad pop music that doesn't fit the otherwise good atmosphere of the restaurant, the food portions very kind of significantly on each visit, the service is so-so, I've been ignored before on things like refilling water, getting me the check, etc. This time I waited over 10 mins for the check. They don't list their cocktail drink prices on the menu so you have to individually ask for pricing on a drink (they are also over priced). I would recommend going here before it gets too crowded and the lunch deals fade away (before 4 PM). It doesn't get nearly as crowded as the BJs in Carlsbad though. I would also recommend not getting pizza here, mainly because of the price, it costs like $1.50 for each additional topping, I got a deep dish pizza by mistake with several toppings and it was practically bite size for $14. Ouch. The bartenders shake drinks vigorously which dilutes the flavor, but they do it to put on a show of course as if that matters more. The beer here is pretty good, but not as good as Stone, Pizza Port, etc. obviously. I think the TVs kind of bring the place down, do people really go to a non-sports bar to watch TV? Or even leave the house to watch TV? I understand having a TV by the bar but not really beyond that.  I would recommend getting a sandwich/salad combo or a pizza salad combo for lunch, it is the best deal and makes me come back here. You can get one of those combos for under $10. P. S.  The rewards program is BS. I've used my rewards card on several visits and have spent about $60 with the rewards card getting me points. I only have 9 points, this means that at this rate you have to spend $500 in order to get to the 75 points that earns you a mere $5 off. Finally, the waiter took 80 cents as a tip when he was barely there. I don't know why waiters think they can just not give you change back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220,3.08,2.73,2.668,2.348,2.87
174,Alissa M.,"San Diego, CA",120,11,3.0,1.0,2015-04-19,"WARNING: VERY GRAPHIC. OKAY MAYBE NOT THAT GRAPHIC BUT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ BEFORE YOU EAT HERE AS YOU MAY LOSE YOUR APPETITE. YES IT'S A NOVEL. First off, I'd like to say our waitress was a very good one. She has great CS but she should look for another restaurant to work at as for what I'm about to express, is going to be real AF. A couple of my best friends and I came here to catch up with life and wanted to share conversation over (what we expected to be) great food. This was on Wednesday (04/15/2015.) We've all been to one of many BJ's restaurants but I myself have not been to this one in 3 years. I ordered the PM Porter to go with my Black and Bleu-House Burger and shoestring fried potatoes. One of my girlfriends ordered the same but wrapped in lettuce with a side of mozzarella and tomato salad. She also ordered a diet Pepsi. My other girlfriend ordered the BJ's Brew house Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Swiss cheese. Instead of fries, she upgraded to their featured Watermelon and Feta salad (extra balsamic vinegar dressing... I forgot her drink tho.) Food was tasty. No issues. Went home. Please keep in mind, we haven't seen each other in almost 2 months and this was like a reunion.  The next day (Thursday 4/16/2015) I had no appetite and was wondering why I felt a little odd. I had coffee and a piece of bread the whole day. I wake up Friday (4/17/2015) go to work at 6am. 10am rolls around and I feel nauseous. Go to the bathroom having the worst pain in my belly and great! I have diarrhea.  Walk back to my desk, having a feeling that I am not done, so I go back to the commode. When I was done, I go back to my desk. Not even 2 minutes pass by and tell my coworker this is ridiculous and now I feel I need to vomit. Low and behold, I puke a chunky waterfall. I do this from 10am to 12pm. I finally tell my boss I gotta go home.  I get home and the pain gets worse and worse. This had gone on until midnight and I finally begged my family to take me to the ER. I was given an anti emetic and morphine (Yes, the pain was that bad and my threshold for pain is actually pretty high) for the excruciating cramps. Also, attached an IV bc of all the electrolytes I had lost while vomiting, from both ends, of my body. I didn't go home until 4:30am. I then learned, it wasn't just me that almost died from someone's poor food handling but also, my two best friends had been going through the same shit. Way too much of a coincidence if you ask me. BJ's, I'm not blaming you but I will blame the son of a bitch that almost killed me and 2 of my best friends because of their neglect in food handling service. Or maybe the quality check was overlooked when preparing the food. WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS AFTER YOU USE THE BATHROOM AND USE GLOVES BEFORE YOU PREPARE ANYONES FOOD. EVEN MAKE SURE THE FOOD ISN'T SPOILED BEFORE PREPARING IT. THE FOOD WE ATE COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO A CHILD... A CHILD WHOSE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE AS STRONG AS 3 GROWN WOMEN. YOU COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE! That is all. I will never come back here and I will tell 3 friends to tell their 3 friends and so on and so forth of the experience I have had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=180,3.04,2.69,2.66,2.148,2.83
151,Randy S.,"San Diego, CA",215,138,471.0,2.0,2015-04-27,"Come because you hear its good food... but leave before you get it because of the service. Pros: Entrees are good. Especially the pizza and bazooki (dessert pizza). Multiple TVs with main sport events Bar area is pretty chill. Not that crowded at this location. Cons: Service - both host area and waiting staff. Too many stuff to put. Parking - not really that bad, it just shares the same lot as North County Westfield mall, so beware of crazy drivers/parkers. Appetizers - hit or strikes... mostly strikes Pre-game disclaimer: First off, since this is a franchise, i wont get into too much of the taste of the food because they ""should"" all be similar... unless drastically different.  For the detailed review,  im going off my multiple times i have been there.  Pre-game night scenario that made me write this review: It's a semi-cold and rainy evening/night in SD. Was set to have a dinner with my partner and her brother, yay. We anticipated a long wait because it was a Friday night, but we didn't anticipate it bejng Prom night. So along with families waiting to be seated, there were groups of ""high fashion"" prom-dressed students waiting eagerly to get their grub on and head to their dance (... why would you go to BJ's for a ""fancy"" prom dinner?! Idk).  Pitching against BJ's... Randy's review!!! Host area: please be honest. If it is going to take about a number of minutes to be seated, it is alright if it is off by +/- 5 or 15 minutes.  If i am told 30 minutes, i am expecting to bs seated no later than about 45 minutes... not be seated after 1 hour.  I understand maybe it is one of those nights where it is busy, hell, its prom night. You would think that since more and more people are packing the lobby the wait time would increase... nope. The host person would tell every group ""it will be about 30min, give or take a few minutes""... yeah... give or take about 1 hour.  Server: most people would agree with me (maybe, i don't know you so yeah, whatever, keep reading) when i say service will make or break the time and reputation of a place. And i fully understand being under stressful and crowded times where a server or worker might forget to check in with a customer/guest.  My friends would say im a very patient guy, even when i am ""hangry,"" so i will yield a few strikes before opting people out...  Counting the couple of times i have been to this location, i got this type of service: Young and overwhelmed - not all young servers/workers are like this... it just so happened the times i came here, i had this. Ball one!... not their fault thise nights were hectic. Passive aggresive - we ordered our drinks and appetizers, then we were asked if we were ready to order entrees. When we said we would need a minute, a look of ""come on really?!"" Accompanied with their eyes rolling as they walked away... strike one! Shortly after receiving our drinks, our appetizers and sweetners/sugars were dropped off... literally dropped.  Food shifted and sweetners and sugar came out of the can. Strike two! When given our drinks and appetizers, the server quickly left without taking out entree order and quickly went to another table to take their orders... mind you, it is a table that came after us and had more females. Strike three! Okay... this is how patient i was... i waited for 1 more strike. Yeah. My ""out"" equals 4-strikes. And what happened?... server walked by me when i put my hand up to get their attention. I understand if i just rose my hand right when they were next to me, but the server was 15-20 yards away, looked at me, and quickly turned away walking towards me with their head facing to his left... really?! I dont think i am anywhere near intimidating, if anything that was my brother-in-law. Strike four = bad review.  Realizing they messed up or they were going to get a bad tip: after all that, my group was pissed. We only got our drinks and appetizers. No plates with the appetizers. And not even our entrees ordered. So my brother-in-law actually got up and went to the back go get plates for ourselves. When our server saw him walk back with plates you can see the ""$*** i messed up"" look on his face. Everything after that, they tried to make things better, but not even admit ""sorry for the delay"" or anything like that.  Did anyone step their game up? Yes, actually. Someone did. And it was the food runner or kitchen staff from the kitchen (they were wearing an apron when they brought us our entrees). Kudos to you kitchen staff. Half-star to you.  Food: Its good... its good enough just to make this review a 2-star review from a 1-star if it was only based on service... but i want to be nice.  Would i come back?  Most likely not. If i do, it would be only if im in the area, craving pizza, and between 2pm-4pm during the weekday.  Am i being too nice? Yes...  yes. I.

I understand its raining and a lot of teenagers are there for their prom but don't promise everyone body that it'll be a 30 minute wait when it ends up being an hour almost an hour an a half! We even heard the person tell a part of 5 that it would be 20 mins!? Nicely, my husband told someone in that party that we were told 30 mins and just finally getting seated. There were enough grumbles and complaints from other parties too.  After being sat at our table, our waiter didn't come to us until 10 mins later. he was very unpleasant, unwelcoming and looked like he was ready to get out of there. We asked for our drinks: ice green tea, two coffees and waters. Guess which one came out first...a cup of coffee. No, not both, just one and my ice green tea. The other cup of coffee came out 10 mins later and the water...well that came AFTER our potato skins came out. -_-  What made his service much more worse was that we kindly asked for some sweetener. Well he just did a run by drop off...not a ""oh here is your sweetener"" and leave. its was a *go by your table and drop if off like a piece of mail and run off to the next thing.* Uh...thanks dude.  On top of that, the waiter was going to get us some plates for the skins...well that never happened. My brother had to literally get out of his chair, go towards the kitchen area and grab plates for us. By the time we were already eating on the plates, the waiter came back and said ""oh, I'm sorry! I forgot about your plates.""  I guess by that point he knew his game was off and that the service was less then par. It took three other staff to take care of us while this guy was no where to be seen, heard or caring.  yea, the food was good but with the lack of customer service, the under promise of the wait time psh, we were don't and didn't care about the quality of the food anymore.

My girlfriend and I ordered a deep dish pizza, half great white and half five meat, and we also ordered the Alfredo pasta with the chicken and broccoli. The pasta was bomb! Pasta was al dente, the chicken was moist, and the broccoli was cooked the way I like with a little crunch to it. The pizza was pretty good as well, but nothing extraordinary. For dessert, our group all split a few of the pizookie trios so everyone was able to get their own mini pizookie. I'm a big fan of chocolate chip and my girlfriend got the Oreo cookie one! Mine was delicious! And my girlfriend's was good too I guess... I mean it was so good she didn't even save me a bite!  Food was good, pasta was bomb, and the pizookies were dank!

Ordered the kids lemonade but the waitress put it in as full orders.  :(  Hubby got a beer and I got a pinapple moscow mule which i liked. Then we ordered the kids corn dogs to share with 2 ketchups and one 1 came out so we had to ask for another ketchup again.  That happens often... I got the steak medallions with mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  Very yummy.  Highly recommend it.  The steaks were nice and tender.  I was able to cut it with a butter knife.  I asked for it to be medium rare, but they were more like medium.  Hubby says it's hard to cook medallions since they are so small.  But they were still very good. Hubby got the tuscan chicken which he really enjoyed as well. For dessert we got the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  It has a cake bottom instead of graham cracker which I really liked.  We actually got this to go and ate it at home. Note for families about the mall - If you have kids with you, the mall has a play area and train.  We didn't do the train but we did go to the play area.  It was really crowded with kids.  They have also added family room (where mom's can go to breastfeed) and kids can watch TV or play with a couple toys while waiting.  The family room also has it's own bathroom with kid size toilet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=200,2.96,2.67,2.664,2.544,2.7859999999999996

Once we got our food, everybody said it was good, except for me who ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and received the BBQ chicken pizza, but of course I didn't want to reorder for fear having to wait another hour. Our waiter did admit that we waited a long time for our food and offered to give my mom a free salad, instead we asked for something a little more practical and asked for a free pizookie. The waiter said ok. When he came back around we actually asked for 2 pizookies, expecting 1 to be comped. When we finally got the bill, both pizookies were being charged. We asked the waiter about this, he advised his manager said they could get us a mini pizookies, but not a full size one.

For two days straight we felt absolutely horrible and we unable to do anything because we were either puking or having explosive diarrhea every 5-10 minutes.

179,A R.,"Tempe, AZ",9,140,5.0,2.0,2015-06-17,"Maybe it was the weekend hustle, maybe it was the holiday weekend hustle.  Whatever it was, it wasn't great.   The place was super packed, we had called in about 30 mins prior to arriving to reserve a table but when we showed up the girl had not written down our reservation, so we had to wait another 40 minutes or so.  We were starving at that point, tired and grumpy otherwise we would've walked out to a fast food place.  Our server was really nice, but she started with her name and then said she was really busy, almost implying whatever service issues happened was not her fault.   We were a group of 7 and 5 of us got our drinks quickly.  The housemade root beer is always good but this time I got it in a warm cup instead of their signature frozen cup.  The extra two waters took a while to get placed in our table too and I never got a refill on my root beer throughout the night.  When we finally got our food, my mother in law had blue cheese on her wedge salad which she had asked to opt out of. Then the replacement salad came with brown lettuce so that was taken back.  The final New salad came at the end of the meal which we had to take in a container since we were all done eating by then. My chicken lettuce wraps came with brown lettuce as well, and to curve my appetite everyone gave me a little bit of their meals.  My new order with green lettuce came very very later, when everyone else was done eating (we had not received the 3rd salad yet at this point).  The waitress apologized again stating they were very busy.   My opinion is either get more servers or don't seat so many people at your restaurant if you're not prepared for the masses. We ordered a gluten free pizzookie which was good, but unfortunately when that arrived I was still halfway through my lettuce wraps dinner so I didn't get to partake.   I would've expected to at least receive a discount or a free dessert on our ticket for the delay in our dinner and the multiple issues, but we didn't.

Burgers were okay but nothing great. They were both a little too dry. We got the Buffalo Brisket Burger and the Crispy Jalapeno Burger.

My partner and I decided we were gonna get some pizookis to-go because we both had pretty bad headaches and just wanted something sweet. I ordered it on the BJ's app, and paid for it (tip included) with a pick-up time of thirty minutes from the time I placed the order.       So we get to BJ's and no one is in the to-go booth are at the hostess area, so we stand there for about 10 minutes by the time a guest tells us we should ask the bartender. So we ask the bartender and he says he didn't receive an online order. I show him the confirmation and he says to us, ""Oh, sorry, I'm retarded and must not have seen it."" At this point I'm frustrated, my partner is upset and his head was throbbing. But they said it wouldn't take long, so we waited. We sit here for about 30 minutes and no one says a word to ask, so I finally ask about our food and they say, ""Oh, sorry..its wrapped up in the back."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'm sitting around waiting with a huge headache and you didn't even come to tell me my food is finished so I can leave.  Then he gives me my food and hassles me about paying online because he couldn't find that I did on the computer. Even though I showed him the online payment confirmation.       Completely ridiculous if you ask me, it took almost an hour to get three mini pizookis. Wish I hadn't paid ahead because then I would definitely not have given the generous tip that I did, actually wouldn't have given any tip.

He refilled our water, but only after we were done eating and had to go the whole meal with NO DRINK?!! What!!! The table next to us waited 20 min for a box for their food and they asked for it as soon as they got their food too! He never asked us how our food was, if we needed anything or if we were having an enjoyable experience. Never have I been so disappointed in the serve at a BJs restaurant! He dropped our check off without clearing our plates which had been empty for about 15min. Overall just an overwhelmed server, who was most likely new and can't handle so many tables.

When she did it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and then our salad never came. The pizza came out along with an entrée about 40 minutes into us sitting down.  I let the server know that the salad never came and asked for it to be removed but instead she brought it over well after our pizza has been served. When she did, I told her that I didn't want it and she said no problem she would take it off the bill and I thought it was done with. However, when we got the bill the salad was still on there and the server was nowhere to be found.

It seems that the food was good, the service was wonderful but the experience was sub par. Here is what happened. It was a Friday night so of course they are packed. We waited and seating opened up in the bar so we sat in there. We ordered our beers and were fine with the noise level of the bar except for some patrons which were playing their laptop at a very high noise level. My friend went to tell the manager. This is where it went left. I Don't want to put the wrong manager name so its the bigger dude with the beard. First off he tells her to hold on he is busy. STRIKE ONE, when a customer says there is a problem you face the customer. Next she asks him to please handle it, and allow the customers know politely its bothering us, and please turn it down. He told her he cant actually do that, so she came back and asked them herself. The customers were apologetic and did it right away! NO big deal, everyone is happy. Until... the manager walks over and checks on them! WTF? I say we handled it since you would not! He then turns his back on us and continues to talk to them. Never once talking or checking on us, and also making it into a bigger deal then need be since everyone was okay by then. A couple of patrons actually turned around and thanked us, because it was louder then the game.   STRIKE TWO is to ignore us. Then another manager (maybe the real one or GM) comes over and talks to them about it again. OKAY this is just getting embarrassing for everyone involved. Once again no one checked on us. Two chicks that threw down 60 bucks for dinner, and a really weird awful experience. I like the pazookie and our real waitress (wish I had gotten her name) was wonderful.

This time it was a completely different there was no Alfredo sauce at all and no garlic bread!!! I had to ask for a side of the sauce! I was extremely disappointed and will not be coming back to this location. I just don't understand how do you mess up pasta? The young male was great I felt bad for him. But the cooks are terrible.

Let me tell you, we had the best service ever! We were seated quickly and ordered our drinks and pizza right away. We ordered a half cheese/half pepperoni medium with no tomato. After waiting a bit, our lovely server Jenavie, regrettably informed us that the chefs had made a mistake and made a whole pepperoni with tomato! She brought it out to us anyway so we would have something to eat in the meantime. She then offered my sister and I complimentary house salads, which were delicious by the way, and told us our originally ordered pizza would be out shortly. Needless to say we were shocked at such hospitality and amazing customer service! We had so much leftover pizza and left so full and happy that the two hour drive back to San Bernardino County was smooth sailing.

182,Brandie F.,"Oceanside, CA",14,8,22.0,1.0,2015-12-20,If I could give no stars for this review I would. Here's why. Tonight was the first time my husband and I and a friend went who is a regular to Bjs at the North County Mall shopping center in Escondido. Our waitress Aaliyah was AMAZING serving us even with the situation I encountered with our food. We started with some appetizers the Siracha queso chili verde dip and potato skins. When we got our food the dip was cold so they had to remake fortunately the potato skins were good. Second time receiving our dip everything seemed great until I started noticing I had been chewing something hard so I decided to pull it out and to my surprise took out a huge chunk of melted plastic. When we notified our waitress she notified the manager on duty Shawn who was unsympathetic towards my situation when we told her that this was the second time making the dip and now there's melted plastic which is toxic. She kept saying it was the plastic wrap from the cheese that wasn't fully unwrapped when we tried telling her that's not the big issue you don't let the wrapper melt with your dip and tell a customer it's just the wrapper from the cheese when that's a health issue. The manager didn't seem to sympathetic about what I had almost eaten and was rude about it. She did take the dip off our bill but I felt more should of been done especially for a first time customer. After that I lost my appetite and didn't want to eat my broccoli cheddar soup anymore and my friends club sandwich had soggy bread. I can definitely say this will be my first and last time going to a BJs and anyone that has had a good experience at another location beware of this one!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220,3.12,2.89,2.764,2.372,2.982

116,C S.,"Escondido, CA",0,23,,2.0,2016-01-04,"My fiance and I visited BJ's with 6 of our closest friends for our birthdays in November. I want to start this review by saying that we are a crowd of extemely lax people. We all have worked in customer service in some capacity, most of us have restaurant experience of some sort. To start, our server did not even come by the table to introduce herself (she will remain nameless, to spare her embarrassment) until 20 minutes after we were seated. I am not exaggerating. OTHER servers kept telling us she would ""be with us shortly."" When she did come, we explained immediately that we were all on separate checks, which I know can be a hassle--why we explained it upfront. She numbered us all off and told us to remember our numbers for the rest of our dinner. Mind you, none of us have a memory problem. I just thought this was extremely odd and very tacky. (She wasn't kidding. I forgot my number at one point, and she was irritated with me and had me repeat back everything on my tab so she could give me a new ""number"") We all ordered drinks at the same time. They all came out in a seemingly haphazard order, and separately. My friend's flight of beers came out before my easy-peezy glass of wine, and my fiance's mojitos (x3) all came out before my friend's first Long Island..?? Our food was no different. It came out haphazardly, though we all ordered at the same time. I'm not talking two-trips to the kitchen. I mean that all 8 dishes came out sporatically over the span of FORTY MINUTES. By the time I finished my food, my fiance was just getting his. We ordered the same dish. Now- my real beef. My brother ordered a sandwich and fries. SO easy. He waited 45 minutes. Then at the hour mark, we asked the server where it was. She quickly replied it was ""dead"" and there would be another up shortly. We asked the manager to please come talk to us, we had had enough. We calmly and politely explained the situation to her, and she retorted that she appreciated our concern, but the employee had done ""the right thing"" and she would be happy to offer it at a discount for us if we were truly upset by the situation. I'm SORRY. In WHAT WORLD does neglecting your customers' food to the point that it is declared ""dead"" and then putting in an order for a new one to correct your mistake count as ""the right thing""?!?  We weren't looking for any freebies. But a sincere, honest apology would have been nice. We will not be back. Shame, because we liked this place up until this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140,3.04,2.87,2.764,2.7280000000000006,2.9380000000000006

Recently I tried the unlimited soup and salad at the Carlsbad/Encinitas location. Their Clam Chowder was absolutely amazing. We often come only in the winter months specifically for the Grand Cru, which is one of the best beers my wife and I have ever had. Today we came for that specifically while it should still be in season and to eat while we are here. Not only was our favorite beer here not on tap, (they had already converted to some ""Committed IPA"") they did not have any bottled in the back either. With a secondary choice in hand, I diverted my go-to pasta choice and ordered the fish and chips. Horrible decision. It tasted smokey and burnt as if they had been using the same oil for all of 2015, and we are currently 1/2 way through January of 2016. I tasted my son's chicken tenders, other son's mini corn dogs and the same result. Smokey and burnt tasting. Wishing I was oils have went with the Chicken Alfredo.

Even though there were so many of us, our waitress was very attentive, patient, suggestive, and sweet. We took while to order because some of our orders were complicated. The Birthday boy wanted Jambalaya but he wanted to substitute the rice for pasta and so our waitress, Amy made a few suggestions. She suggested him to add more sauce since the pasta will soak up the sauce which would make his meal dry. He also had a few questions regarding their beer as he was making his first alcohol purchase. He was going to get the beer flight, but she suggested to get their BJ's special which is served before 3pm I believe and it was a whole pint glass of beer which was a better deal. He ended up getting the special. I used the BOGO lunch entreé with my friend that I found through Yelp, but you need to have rewards card and so my friend signed up for one. Our food came out super fast. I got the GF sausage pizza w/ a Caesar salad w/out crotons lunch combo . It was a huge portion for a lunch combo so it was differently worth the price.  My friend got his free pizookie at the end since it was his birthday.  At the end, we all had to have separate checks, but Amy was very patient and good at her job.

Communication was constant and friendly; I was quite impressed. Food came out quickly fresh and quickly.   -Ahi Salad (a very large salad with plenty of fresh ahi, worth trying if you like ahi) The most recent time coming here was for happy hour. Open seating in the bar area. Great service and delicious food. Ordered a couple special drinks however, they could use better mixes.  Started off with... -BJ's Bloody Mary (you can totally tell it was not mixed well. Came straight from premade juice. NOT recommended) -Long Island (was made perfectly) -A Drink Like That (not a very refreshing drink. has a bitter taste that doesnt go down well) Venture out with Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151 Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Punch, BJ's fresh sweet & sour and a splash of Sierra Mist.  Appetizers -Margarita Flat Bread (light. crisp. love that basil; gives a nice flavor of ingredients) -NEW Lemon Pepper Dry Rub Wings (my fave. so crispy, tender, meaty, and seasoned perfectly. if you love wings this is a must try) -shoe string fries (came out nice a crisp) Ended with the classic chocolate chunk pizookie; i noticed that it did take quite awhile to get to our table (cannot go wrong with this dessert) Again service was great during happy hour; attentive, we didn't feel rushed.

101,Brian G.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,2.0,3.0,2016-02-18,"Let me start off by saying we've been to this BJ's on multiple occasions, probably over 15 times in the past 6 years or so - this rating is based on a cumulative experience over those years. The service is really a hit or miss. Sometimes our waiters are awesome and super helpful with choices especially since the menu changes on a regular basis or because there is so much to choose from. Unfortunately, the service can also be a nightmare. On one occasion it took 45 minutes to get our food for a party of 8 and there was no feedback from our server other than ""it'll be out soon."" Most recently, we went on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30 for a party of 10. We were seated even before being assigned a waiter - we couldn't get anyone's attention to help us out and when we finally did, the waiter was surprised no one was helping and said, ""I guess I'll be your server then."" She was great, but it's stuff like that that you just have to question the service. The beer selection is great! So much to choose from, both in-house, local, and national. The in-house beer is OK, but I'll stick to the SD breweries instead. A variety of food to select from but it is often overwhelming. There is definitely something for everyone so it makes getting a large group together easy because everyone can have something they like. Only downfall? See the upper section about the service - it seems the more people in your group the more difficult the service. Overall, it's a chain restaurant that works and if we had another choice that everyone in the family liked, we would go there instead. I guess we're just comfortable with BJ's, I just wish their service was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140,3.12,2.87,2.76,2.8280000000000003,2.9700000000000006

Every single time, lunch or dinner, I am amazed by how much time has passed when I go to leave. We had to wait more than 30 minutes for dessert once, asking repeatedly where it was. Today luckily we had a coupon for Buy 1 entrée, get 1 free. We got 2 ribeyes, trying to get the most value out of our coupon. One of our steaks looked completely different, like a sirloin. I said something to our server Stephanie, and she went back to check with the kitchen. Their response was that the steak is weighed, and the same size. Yeah, still not convinced. Ribeyes are round, not triangular. The food is decent most of the time. The asparagus is usually tough. The steak knives tear your food, maybe bring your own. Pizza and dessert are good, and some of the small bites. We got takeout a week ago (another free offer). It was fairly fast, maybe 15 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken salad isn't as good as CPK, get it there instead. Potato skins were good, but a little light on the toppings. It is also often dark, cold, and very loud.

Service is usually great but last night service wasn't great unfortunately. It started out okay but once a large party was seated near us- we were kind of forgotten about. We had to ask someone else for drink refills, a plate for my boyfriends pizza (which took a while to come & was awkward since we all had our food & was eating). A chip refill because the $18 appetizer we ordered came with a large thing of spinach artichoke dip and maybe like 8 chips in a tiny cup (which doesn't make all that much sense to me why they do that but whatever), Our drinks refills and his plate came but our chips never did. We had to ask for it again at the end and just took it home.  We are not the kind of people to go and speak to the manager or make a huge deal and try to get anything comped- we just deal with it. However, we are 20% or more kind of tippers but in this case, we only left 18% which was still pretty generous considering the service.

We sat down and waited for at least 30-40 minutes. We didn't make a big deal about this since it was a Saturday night. Our name was called and the girl calling the names said one of her coworkers would take us to our table.  We stood there waiting for about 5 minutes while her and her coworkers were having a conversation about their personal lives until my boyfriend, who was fed up at this point, asked if they were ready to seat us. The girl who had called our name told us they were waiting for our table to be cleaned off.  Finally after standing for 10 minutes of more waiting, one of the girls took us to our table. The table was still dirty when we sat down. It still had water rings from cups and salt on it, so obviously they hadn't been cleaning it off.  We had been sitting there for 5 minutes and no one had come up to ask us for or order or even what we wanted to drink.

I do believe BJ's began with the intention of being a solid pizza/brewery house. Somewhere along the way, they lost all sense of what is truly important in the service industry- SERVICE. The menu at BJ's is extensive, but not so much that they should not be able to handle it. We came in at 5:30. Party of 7- 3 younger kids, 1 teenager and 3 adults. When we arrived it was pretty mellow and none of the other tables were occupied. We had decent service in the beginning. There was no issues in bringing a bottle of good wine and waters and 3 appetizers to a table - before most of the party had not arrived. We felt like once the other tables were filled, we were forgotten. It took us 20 minutes to get a slice of cheese on a plate for a kids cheeseburger meal that they forgot the cheese on! We were never checked on, or even spoken to as fellow humans... other than taking an order and putting us through the BJ's machine. The food was palatable. I cannot say any of our meals stood out. I'm not a fan of less than 100%. BJ's in Esco is far from breaking the 80% mark. Our seared ahi salads were mediocre (I'm an asshole for ordering ahi in BJ's) Meals were served so staggered, we didn't have anyone eating at the same time.

We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our waiter to return to take our food order.  The waiter only took half of our orders and returned slightly later to get the remaining food orders. I received my plate a full 20 minutes prior to the rest of the table! Seriously, there were 3 orders for salads and my salmon dish came out 20 minutes before theirs. By the time the rest of the table received their orders, the salmon dish was cold and I asked to have the dish reheated only to have it be the worst dish I have ever ordered.

It's not the best deep dish pizza in town, but it's good enough for me to crave it every once in awhile!! Tips: make sure you sign up for their rewards program--it's free, you get points for discounts, and you get emails about free Pizookie days among other deals. I also recently noticed they have a chalkboard outside with daily specials offered. The only one I recall off the top of my head is half off large deep dish Mondays.. UM, count me in!? They have a decent happy hour and I usually find a beer that I like when I'm here.  BJ's offers curbside delivery, take out, dine in, and bar seating. Personally I don't have a preference between bar and dine in seating, and I've had a good experience with take out as well.  Call me plain Jane, but one of my favorites here is the pepperoni 100 ways deep dish. They have julienned, whole slice, among other forms of pepperoni that comes out super crispy and delicious! Deep dish here always wins.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you order a Pizookie!? They have several options such as a trio sampler and several different flavors, some seasonal. I've tried several and personally I like to stick with chocolate chip because other flavors have been too sweet.

Today we went to this BJ's and we were served by Steven W.  Steven was slow getting the water. I ordered the lunch special buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and added the drink and ENDLESS fries for $1 extra. My wife got a pepperoni pizza and a wedge salad. The salad arrived 30 seconds before the rest of the food and had very little dressing, bacon or tomatoes. We asked Steven to get more dressing for us but it never arrived. The food was pretty decent but I soon ran out of soda and my wife ran out of water. We had to start drinking our kid's waters. We did not see Steven again until we were done eating. I wanted more fries but never had a chance to ask because Steven never came by. We would watch him talk to other tables, stand around, and walk very slowly from place to place around the restaurant. He had no sense of urgency and my wife had to take our kids to the car because we had finished and waited at the table 10 minutes just sitting there waiting for the check.  Once Steven delivered the check he realized his failure and gave me his goodbye speech even though I had not paid yet. I immediately put my card in the check holder but Steven had already walked away. I waited approximately 8-10 minutes for Steven to return to the table, he picked up the bill and card and went into the back. He reappeared without my card or the bill and slowly walked around the restaurant with no sense of urgency. Another 10 minutes went by before he returned with my check. I was a server for three years and my wife was a server for 5 years and neither of us have ever had such bad service. It took us an hour and fifteen minutes to eat two lunch specials and get out of the restaurant.

When the host who originally took our name fixed it and we were being seated we got the dirtiest look from the host ,who called us liars. Now when our server LINDA came I have never had worse customer service. There where 3 sets of couples that came in and were able to finish they're meals pay and leave before we we're even checked on. Linda refused to check in at our table. Linda didn't bother to ask if we needed anything. Linda also refused to clear our tiny table or refill our drinks, as it was the only thing we had been served up to this point. When we where able to ask for refills she through them on the table causing them to splash or spill unapologetic Linda continued to disappear. Linda checked on us a total of 3 times after we flagged a separate server asking to cancel our order and give us the check. It took an extra hour for our food to come out, note they didn't complete our request to cancel the order instead Linda stayed away until our meal was ready. When our food finally arrived it was cold and tasteless. Linda didn't offer to reheat or remake Linda gave us our ticket and was speedy to collect the tab in hopes of a tip in all I was very dissatisfied I honestly believe she refused us the service we where do because we are an interracial couple.

244,Maddie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-02-25,"My husband and I recently had a terrible experience at this location. When we initially got to the restaurant we were given an estimated wait time of 30 minutes. We were pretty hungry but decided to stay anyways. 45 minutes pass and we still not been seated. I asked the host how much longer it would be and she apologized but said the wait would be another 10-15 minutes. Although we were hungry, thirsty, and now a little frustrated we gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to wait. We ended up waiting 20 more minutes bringing our total wait time to over an HOUR before we were finally given a table even though we were initially quoted 30 minutes. We were willing to look past this and finally get some drinks and food and wouldn't you believe it but we ended up sitting at the table another 10 minutes and still hadn't seen our waiter. We started grabbing our things to leave when finally our waiter swoops in to greet us. Since we had so much time to look at the menu we again gave the staff another chance and stayed. We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at once making us what I think a pretty easy table to handle. We get our drinks and appetizer in a timely manner but guess what, we WAITED again, about 25 minutes after our appetizer for our entree. No staff had come to talk to us, we're just sitting, waiting, having no idea where our entrees or waiter were. Our food was finally delivered and at the delivery our waiter said our food was given to another table and they had started eating it so the kitchen had to remake our food. No apology was given, but our waiter informed us he had talked to the manager and had comped the up-charge on the asparagus my husband ordered. Thanks dude. All our waiting saved us $2 off our entire bill. It really felt like a slap in the face. I used to work at a restaurant and when mistakes like this were made the managers made it a point to speak to the table AND offer to take care of the appetizer with possibly a gift card to return again at a later date. It's very disappointing to see how some customers are willing to give a restaurant multiple chances only to be let down time and time again.

The pizza was served to us room temperature so that was disappointing but we were running behind for a soccer game so I did not Day anything to the server.

On all of the occasions we were here I am almost positive we get the calamari since its so crispy. Maybe not my favorite place to get calamari But I like quality and quantity and here it is just right. One time we ordered the fried potato skins and that was pretty awesome since I never had them here before and they were so delicious I almost passed out. I am all about textures and I remember these still to this day because as soon as the plate arrived I thought they were burned they looked a little darker than what I am used to with potato skins. They are very hearty and bigger than what I am used to also. But when I took that first bite my eyes grew wide and my husband and I smiled at each other like little kids.

My girlfriend and I sat there for 30 minutes and didn't even get a greeting to let us know that they acknowledged us as paying customers. I finally mustered up the courage to let the hostess now that we haven't even gotten water, let alone greeted. Another server heard this and she jumped to the occasion to help, even though it wasn't her section (she's awesome) . After finally getting our orders I thought that it was the turning point, well I was wrong. Not only did my girlfriend find TWO pieces of hair in her pizza, but I never even got asked if I wanted any more water or another beer (which I did). So after, I spoke to the manager RON. I let him know that I never ever complain at restaurants, but I just wanted to let him know how the service went. He joked and said, ""I'm glad I can make history"". Funny, but not the response I was hoping for. He said he would help with some of the bill, which I didn't care for but thought was a nice gesture. Turns out that nothing was done.

I love their maple salmon pita on that part of the menu...so delicious you barely know it's better for you. Their pizzas have that good cheese elasticity when you pull away from the pie and have a nice crispy crust that you would get from a pan pizza. A large variety of beers in house and from other breweries on tap and in bottles from fruit to spice to hops and double IPAs. Seriously there's something for everyone.

If you are a chocolate fan, I'd recommend their Godiva pizookie. It's definitely chock-full of chocolate from cookie to topping. If you have a large party or a couple of kids who can eat a lot of dessert, you should totally order the party sized pizookie. The thing is massive and has 3 scoops of ice cream with toppings.

96,Nathan J.,"San Diego, CA",2,11,3.0,1.0,2017-07-09,Went to have dinner on 7/9/17. Our waitress Adalie E did not check on us once during our meal. When she finally came to give us our check we asked if we can split the check evenly and she seemed a bit annoyed. It's 2017 so splitting a check is not new to this industry. We asked her if she can apply the rewards points to a loyalty card which we provided instead of the account that was on file (used the app to book seats so that's the account that was on the receipt). adalie went to charge us and came back saying the loyalty points were successfully applied to the card even though the receipt confirmed it was to the wrong account. When we wanted to confirm she walked away from us mid conversation as if she had more important things to attend to. I will not be recommending this place to friends based off this horrendous experience. What kind of waitress walks away from her tables when we're trying to ask a question??

95,Amber G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",139,8,1.0,1.0,2017-07-14,"If I could give negative stars I would.Last night was the last time I will ever be visiting a BJs. A lot of people I know already don't go there because the service is ALWAYS bad but I still try to go because I really enjoy the beer and food. I have never been so angry at a restaurant before in my life. It took a long time for my mom and I to even get our order placed because the waitress came by to take it then said hold on and honestly disappeared for about 5 minutes. That is when we should have known to leave. My mom and I both ordered the same burger, the late night burger. After 30 minutes of placing our order our server comes up to us and says the kitchen just told me we are out of the late night burger. We have already been waiting for a little over 30 minutes and this is the first time we are hearing of this. She said the manager would be right by and we can place another order. So we put in another good order because we were starving. No manager ever showed up, then 2 minutes after placing our new order, the burgers we first ordered came out. We were confused. So they weren't out of the burger they just didn't want to make it? I cut into mine and it's cooked way over well done but I was so hungry at this point. The manager, Adam, finally waltz his way over to us. All he says awkwardly is, talk to me. I tell him my complaints and how the burger is over done, not once does he even try to say let me fix that for you. All he said was oh well we have those other 2 burgers you ordered cooking still, I snapped we don't even want those. After a highly awkward encounter, I don't know how he is a manager, he can't even talk to people. He walks away saying we will take care of you guys tonight don't worry. We ask for our bill both only eating half of the burger. My daughter is extremely fussy at this point and ready to leave since it's been an hour and half already (the waitress even made a comment oh she is getting loud and ready I can tell) I wanted to say to her yeah because this entire experience has been slow and long. The first bill we received had 4 burgers on it. They never took off the burgers we ordered in replace of the burger we wanted. She comes back with the corrected bill and nothing is taken off. Not even a single burger. So the manager lied straight to our faces. Luckily we had a coupon for buy one get one but our bill was still 30$ because we each had a beer. We finally left after 2 hours of being there. The service was terrible all around, the manager needs to get a new job because managing is definitely not his strong suite, and that whole staff needs to be retrained. They ran food to the wrong table 3 times while we were there. This place needs fixed up and Adam should not be a manager!

Took another 15 minutes after we got water to get our food order placed and then over 30 mins to get our food to us.. again the restaurant was at around 50% capacity ...  As the food came around and we were eating my mother noticed how meager the Mahi mahi fish portions were in her fish tacos... probably total of two ounces if not less.. we made a comment to the waiter who acknowledged that it was not normally like that. The manager came around 10 mins later and was kind enough to remove it from the bill... What was most frustrating came when we asked for the check... I kid you not almost 20 mins came by and we still had not received it... I had to walk over to one of the computer stations  where orders are inputed and asked to pay immediately..

23,Kevin H.,"San Marcos, CA",2,66,108.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"Before reading this review please note that I accept the following: BJs is a fairly large chain restaurant and therefore quality can suffer. We originally came here to have a pint of the pumpkin ale and an appetizer. Upon ordering the pumpkin ale we were told ""that it is not working."" How does beer not work!?!? Disappointed, we ordered other BJ beers because it was happy hour and we were put in an awkward situation. We also ordered chips and guacamole which took 30 minutes to arrive. After 20 mins of waiting, we inquired with our waitress to our chips whereabouts only to be told they needed to make more guacamole and it would take 10 mins. Where is the communication waitress? The waitress did bring us free salsa for waiting, which was nice. The guac had cucumbers in it, which I found odd. After eating chips, we regrettably decided to order dinner and another beer. I watched my beer sit at the bar for at least 10 minutes while our waitress continually walked past the beer. Once our food arrived it was decent, but like I said, I accept that I'm at BJs.

301,Matthew H.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1.0,5.0,2017-10-16,"BJ's has stepped up their game and fixed some major issues that had me avoiding this location for a while. A couple months ago my family and I decided to give BJs another shot after about a year long hiatus. Why the hiatus? BJs had been plagued with slow service, poor wait staff, and delivered cold food. On our return visit, we found the wait staff to be pleasant, helpful, and feel they went above and beyond with. Having two young children, it was a nice surprise to find BJs brings out a snack plate for the kids. The food came quickly, was exactly what we ordered, and was cooked to perfection. We had such a great visit we returned again and had another great experience. We will be making BJs a regular family outing again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=20,3.08,3.01,3.016,2.868,3.038

My significant other ordered a soup and salat. Both not too spectacular, but okay. Not well presented. We found it was prized ok. Maybe a bit over prized. 6/10 Location: nah. It felt like the cheesecake factory just a little brighter inside. However, the issue is that BJs simply is not the cheesecake factory offering great deserts. 6/10 because it is close to the mall. Music: it is a sports bar concept with too many TVs. If you do not want to talk to somebody, but just stare on sport events, this could be a good place for you, not for me. 4/10 Comments:  overall, the only reason why we wanted to try it out is because we got tired of the horrible service of the cheese cake factory.

I always order my burgers plain. After waiting an excessive amount of time, I get my burger.. with everything on it. No problem, mistakes happen right?! Sent it back while my husband waits with his sandwich. Comes back and it was the same burger, the bottom bread was completely soggy and it tasted like lettuce.. onions all in the cheese! Seriously?! And after it was dropped off, we sat.. and sat and sat. Over 30 minutes go by and my husband has at this point eaten his sandwich and I have eaten a couple fries. No one ever comes back and my husband gets up to finally tell them we have had enough. I don't even want another burger, just to leave as quickly as possible. The waitress brings the check out and apologizes she forgot us. At least they take the burger off we didn't eat :/ We couldn't believe the horrible service we received, and no manager to apologize.

It's not deep dish, not by any stretch of the imagination. Did a build-your-own with sausage, pepperoni, olive, and garlic. The box it came in was a regular pizza box that wasn't nearly deep enough for a deep dish (first clue), the outside bottom of the box was covered in dried cheese, grease, and bits of dried food (second clue), and, even though we waited15 minutes for the pizza to come out, the box was cold as opposed to just-out-of-the-oven warm (third clue). Despite these red flags, we didn't open the box to review the contents before driving home -- which is totally on us -- or we would have discovered they gave us the wrong pizza -- olive, jalapeno, and tomato. Thirty dollars for a veggie pizza whose cheese had already turned hard and cold on the seven minute drive home (probably because it had been cold to begin with).

My most recent visit we were delivered the wrong pizza. Our waiter seemed to be in a rush the whole time on a not so busy day. The kitchen seemed a bit out of sync as we were originally delivered a small pepperoni that my friend mentioned wasn't ours and seemed to upset the guy bringing us our food as he replied back with a rude tone as if we didn't know what we ordered. Only to have another wrong pizza delivered by our waiter himself. Our pizza was a half bbq chicken and half chicken bacon ranch. We started with the bbq chicken as none of us at the table have tried the chicken bacon ranch to know what it looked like and just believed our rushing waiter. We didn't notice the mistake until we ate half the pizza and didn't have the normal ""How's everything tasting"" to mention the mistake. Near the end of our meal another waitress made a comment about us having the wrong pizza delivered and continued on.
