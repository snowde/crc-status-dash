However, I can't give them five stars when I got a mediocre salad for 13$ and a cocktail for 9.25$ Very updated and a great addition to the VRC.

147,Matt W.,"Eugene, OR",0,10,1.0,5.0,2013-06-25,Tried out this reincarnation of BJ's here in Eugene on there opening night.  Went for takeout and was met by an upbeat staff at the front door.  The take out staff was equally friendly and very efficient.  They had my order ready when I arrived (5 minutes ahead of schedule!).  The Santa Fe Chicken salad was spicy and just what I had hoped for...  Huge menu to choose from.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=160,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676
116,Katherine B.,"Eugene, OR",171,12,,2.0,2013-07-01,"My mom and I went here yesterday for lunch, we both ordered Cobb salads and drinks.  The bad:  Salads were pretty bad they were the crappiest Cobb salads ever!  How do you mess up a classic like Cobb salad????  Well I'll tell ya;   The lettuce was chopped like coleslaw, no bleu cheese no cheese at all for that matter,  no egg, maybe a 1/2 a piece of bacon, about a table spoon of chopped flavorless chicken and it came with way too much dressing to the point where I couldn't eat it all.  The salads were way too expensive for what they were!  Also, our table was so close to the diners next to us that it felt like we were eating with them, we actually ended up talking to them because we were practically at the same table anyways. The good:  The service was great the ladies that helped us were very nice.  The decor is kinda cool, very  neat floors, light boxes and moldings.  My Piranha ale was great and so was her gin bloody Mary. Anyways it was my 1st experience at a BJ's and if I go back I'll never order another salad, EVER!   -Katherine",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=120,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
92,Mark A.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,341,233.0,3.0,2013-07-04,"My darling wife and I have visited both BJ's locations in Eugene now. It's a step up from the usual chain restaurant experience, and a nice way to eat during a shopping excursion, but hardly destination dining. The menu is huge, a dozen pages-plus of pizza, sandwiches, entrees, lunch specials, drinks and desserts. I think it must be unwieldy to manage a kitchen with so many options, and our experience is evidence of just that. The waitress punched in the wrong drink order in the POS, and had to retrieve another beer from the bar. The kitchen made our spicy meatball pizza with a deep dish crust when we ordered hand-tossed thin crust, but the mistake was spotted before it was served, and the waitress took our salads off the bill to make up for the delay. If it's not clear yet from the reviews, this is a brew pub with its own line of beers on tap. Like Gordon Biersch the beers are not made on the premises, but at a remote brewery under private label. That's not necessarily bad, but don't go expecting hopheads at the bar to expound on which region is best for Cascade growing. MDW liked her porter, and I liked my amber ale, but they weren't transcendent experiences. The atmosphere is clean, polished and corporate. The bathrooms are immaculate and high-tech. The staff has the affected courtesy you expect from a chain. It's quite popular as well. Even though we were very late for lunch (or early for dinner if you prefer), the place was fairly busy, and only became more so as we sat. It will be crazy once football season and Christmas roll around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=80,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38

For starters it has more room, very friendly and attentive staff and centrally located. The other location I didn't rate so high because it was always a pain to park, a pain to wait, the food was just ok to me. I came here the opening week and had a very pleasant dining experience, the food was top notch! I had a rib eye steak with the red wine sauce and the horse radish mashed potatoes. Let me tell you! Hello fatty put down the fork! I could not stop taking bites it was so flavorful. I will be back for sure and can't wait to try other menu items. Way to step up your game Bj's! Sorry I'm not doing 5 star because its not sit down candle lit but I would say its 4 in a half with the steak. I have gone back and tried other menu items and I have to say I am quite pleased! I tried the encrusted chicken Parmesan which I have ordered quite a few times now and I'm not a chicken fan. I also like the balsamic chicken. These are not bland items. I see so many people comment that the food here is bland well these are not! They are quite full of flavor!

They just recently opened a new location at Valley river center and its Bea-U-tiful, rumor has it they spent 2.5 million on the bar alone and 6 million on the new location.  They staff is awesome.

170,Dominic I.,"Eugene, OR",4,26,10.0,1.0,2013-08-30,"This place is a goddamn joke.  Saddest corporate restaurant i've ever seen. We went there with an hour and a half!! before we were going to a movie.  Sat at the bar.  Not very busy, but the one bartender was making drinks for the floor and his bar so he wasn't dead, i will give him that.  We ordered drinks and than asked if there was a happy hour for food.  There was, looked at a menu and ordered 2 apps, we decided to just get that and go to dinner after the movie.  Twenty minutes go by.  I had seen a server bring another bar patron their food, and we knew he rang it in because he printed a new tab every time we added to it and put it in a cup right in front of us.  We ordered another drink and just waited.  At forty five minutes, we are trying to get the attention of the bartender but it seems like he's avoiding us at all cost.  Finally he makes eye contact and immediatly says ""I'm gonna go check on that food"".  Gone for 5 minutes, servers EVERYWHERE standing around... comes back with food for someone at the other end of the bar.  Goes back in the kitchen for 5 more minutes.  Finally after an hour he comes out with our food.  The ""boneless wings""... two of the 5 were literally as big as a quarter, and everything was completely cold.  It had obviously been sitting on the line waiting to bed ran for AT LEAST 30 minutes if not more.  There were so many servers on shift I don't know how anyone let food sit there for that long.  cooks, managers, all totally oblivious.  It was an outrage.  The bartender and manager tried to say that it was because there was a shift change happening and people were getting off and coming on and thats why there were so many people just standing around, we didn't want our food nor had time to wait another long ass time to get it remade.  They took the food off our bill and gave us a 15$ gift card.  We couldn't use the gift card to buy our drinks, cant use it on the same visit.  Not looking forward to going back.  prolly gonna just have drinks again and no food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=180,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

172,Jennifer B.,"Eugene, OR",0,8,,1.0,2013-09-10,"We won't be returning.   Pro - call ahead seating, outdoor patio with windows that close for winter. Cons - Pricey menu, small portions, insanely LOUD atmosphere, poor lighting, uneducated waitstaff. We decided to try out BJ's after they moved, first visit had a line out the door with a 45+ minute wait.  We found they had call ahead seating, and took the number for a future visit.  When we decided to try again, I utilized the call ahead seating before we left for our 15 minute commute.  When we arrived, we still waited another 15 minutes to get a seat.  We were seated in a booth adjacent to the bar area.  This would not have been my choice seat - being a family with children.  The entire restaurant was insanely noisy - couldn't hear my husband from across the table.  The restaurant is dark, and with it being a sunny day, and brightness coming through the main entrance, I was blinded the entire vist, and couldn't even see my husband across the table from me.  We had a coupon for a free ""bite"" and ordered the won tons.  Server promptly returned saying they were temporarily out of won tons, and convinced me to select a different item.  Then returned a few minutes later only to say that they really did have won tons, so he did order me that.  I wish he would have returned to give me the option - because I would have stayed with our second choice. Kids meals were very small.  One of my kiddos asked for veggies/ranch as the side.  And he received 3 small baby carrots, and 2 sticks of celery - all of which were dried looking.  Other kiddo asked for a salad, and received a very small pile of lettuce - no veggies. The kids entree was also small - and both my kiddos (6 and 9) begged for a snack within an hour of eating dinner here. I ordered a calzone, which was only meh.  All of my toppings were on one end of the calzone - and it was mostly air.  It was very small for the $10, and came with nothing else.  Husband ordred a pasta dish, and was happy with it.

I like this atmosphere and set up a lot better than the coburg location. This is not the place to go if your looking for a quiet relaxing night out. I give it 4 stars because the hostesses at the front desk act robotic. First time I came in it wasn't busy at the entrance, nobody waiting. I asked for a table for two, towards the side of her was someone ready to seat us. We walked up to the lady ready to seat us and the hostess requests that we take a seat and they'll seat us when they're ready.

The new location is wonderful and this was my 2nd visit  but tonight nothing went right. I called ahead to put our name on the list but I called to soon. Called back 30 min. later and was told that once we got to the restaurant there would still be a 30 min wait for our party of six. Ok, so we hop in the car. By the time we get there the wait is now 50 min. Ok, so we wait. Its my sons Birthday - this is a family tradition. From the time we sat til the food got to us was well over an hour and a half. We weren't the only table being neglected they were slammed - at capacity- and the kitchen could not keep up . At the end a manager handed out thank you cards (good for $5 -$500 gift cards but you can use only one per visit - we got four- and are good for only two months) and apologized, as did our waiter. But I don't think I will return, the food, price and service just are not good enough to make it worth the 3hrs we spent there.

152,Nan L.,"Springfield, OR",0,6,,3.0,2013-10-16,"We stopped in here on 10/13/13 for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is very shiny (though there was a cobweb in the vaulted ceiling of the foyer) and a little less loud than, say, an Outback or similar restaurant would be. The lighting level was fine. We had to wait for about 30 minutes to be seated. We ordered the hand-tossed BJ's Favorite pizza. The large 14"" size will give a party of four about two slices each (though on ours there was one HUGE slice and one teeny-tiny slice mixed among the others). We also ordered the crispy calamari, chicken pot stickers, and garlic parmesan boneless wings. Calamari: The good news: you get a lot for your ten bucks. The bad news: it's not that great. It was rather chewy, and I get the impression that it is not a 'proper' calamari, in the sense that you get a mix of the traditional battered mantle rings and little battered baby squid that met their demise in the deep fryer. Not that I care that much, personally, but if you're a purist you will want to skip it. The lemon-garlic aioli was rather good though. Pot stickers: They were pretty good, if a tad too brown on one side. The accompanying sauce is good. Wings: The best of the appetizer lot that we had -- very tender, well-seasoned, and generously-sized chunks of white meat.  The pizza was pretty good, aside from the odd cutting job. My partner had the PB Porter, which he liked; the Tatanka is also a good one if  you like dark beers. I had the Brewhouse Blonde, which is quite tasty. The waiter also provided a sampler of the pumpkin ale, which sounds like a great novelty, but would be way too rich IMHO to justify an entire glass of it. Unless you REALLY like the taste of pumpkin and spice in your brew. Their pazookies are arguably the best thing on the menu (besides the beer). Just be aware that they are LARGE. The chocolate chunk pazookie is a big chocolate chip cookies with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on it; the peanut butter chunk one is a VERY rich peanut butter cookie with the same. If you're not a big dessert eater or are self-conscious about it, you can order the mini size, which is what is pictured on the menu. Service was a bit slow (they were even slow getting the pazookies out, though they were warm from the oven when they arrived), and a little uneven (appetizers arrived not long before the pizza), but the very busy waiter seemed attentive enough and he was very helpful and had a great attitude. Dinner for four was around $80 including drinks and dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=160,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

Fries were dry and cold, very small amount with a few so burnt they were completely black. Also tasted my friends salad, (barbeque chicken) which was messy pile of bland ice burg lettuce shredded so thin it was hard to even eat. Barbeque chicken was also dry and sauce was very plain.

As the new Texas Roadhouse location isn't open yet, we headed over to BJ's instead; I had had a nice lunch there at the bar a few weeks prior, and my friend was game, so that's what we settled on. I guess a lot of people had decided to do the same as us; the restaurant was bustling, and I believe our waiter may have been slightly overworked. But even though it took a few extra minutes to get our drinks and food, everything was quite good. My cocktail was impossible to mess up (a Tanqueray martini), and my friend's cocktail was apparently decent--she described it as ""a bit sweet,"" though, ""like something you'd get at the Olive Garden."" (I don't believe this was necessarily an insult, as she finished the whole thing.) Our ""black and blue"" flatbread appetizer pizza was quite good--lots of steak, mushrooms, and blue cheese. We both ordered the parmesan-crusted chicken (available in sandwich form at lunch), and were pleased with how juicy and delicious it was. Unfortunately our dinner was disturbed by a group of people sitting directly behind us who looked as though they had emerged directly from a deer stand in the middle of the Oregon wilderness. They were loudly complaining about every aspect of their dinner; indeed, at one point, they called the waiter over to complain about something... after they had cleaned their plates. (Obviously the waiter was at a loss--at one point he actually said, ""There's not much I can do since you ate the whole thing."" Valid point, methinks.)

146,Darian O.,"Eugene, OR",0,4,1.0,2.0,2014-11-23,"Today was my birthday, my family wanted to go to dinner. We stopped by Olive Garden and they had way too long of a wait so we went across the street to BJ's. When we arrived, the hostess which was very stuck up, acted as if she was better than me by the looks she gave and how short she was with me, told me there would be a 20-30 minute wait for my family (9 people). 45 minutes passed as we still stood in their lobby waiting to be seated. Other families of 5 and 6 were getting seated as the walked in. Finally, after an hour of waiting they pushed two small tables together and sat 9 chairs there. The two small tables were enough room for a table of 6. Each chair was touching the other. We asked the waitress if we could slide the empty table next to us over so we could sit comfortably. She said she would need to ask the manager. Soon after the manager (a tall limber young guy) came over to slide the table to ours. He then told us that we requested enough seating for 9 people and that is what they did for us. After giving us more attitude we explained how we had sat for an hour waiting to eat there. He then said, ""you only waited for 45 minutes."" We were ignored by him and the majority of the other staff. One person helped us the entire time. Our waitress was very helpful and polite. Usually the food is very good at this business, but this time is was mediocre. Our experience here was less than enjoyable and was definitely not worth the $225.00 tab we paid for at the end.

We have eaten here many times in the past with excellent service and good food and it has been a pleasurable experience. This time we were on our way to an opening show at the cinema. We were seated quickly and graciously by the hostess and a server introducing herself as Samantha took our order. I knew we only had about an hour to eat so I decided against the delicious pizzas they make and ordered a Brewhouse burger, well-done, with thin cut fries. Samantha was writing as I was the first to order and the other three in our family group ordered. The meal arrived within about fifteen minutes...that was fast. But...the burger Samantha gave to me was pink and had the thick cut fries...oops! I like a juicy burger like anybody but with food contamination so rampant I order my ground meat ""well-done"" for a reason. Ouch! Did she not hear me when I ordered? What was she writing down?? Samantha seemed to be a native English speaker. When I pointed out the error, she offered to bring out more fries and about a minute after bringing them to the table, she came back and asked in a condescending, patronizing tone, ""Are your fries good, are these the right fries??"" Yeah, girl...thanks but I don't have time to eat them now and also, I didn't screw up the order.

Our waitress didn't seem like she really cared to be there, and neither did any of the other wait staff. I've never experienced service that bad.

The staff appeared to be extremely apathetic. Every single person who worked there walked into the room we were in and looked around, but couldn't be bothered to acknowledge the growing number of plates we sat at the edge of our table, or notice we were scrunched into the corner of our booth trying desperately to find room enough to eat comfortably without knocking all the plates and glasses off the table.

Manager Zach B. was able to accommodate our large party on short notice and during a busy lunch rush.  He even sent over complimentary appetizers for our table which added a nice unexpected surprise.  Tiffany H. was our waitress and she was nothing short of outstanding. She made sure that everything ran smoothly by knowing the menu and confidently making menu suggestions to my family members who could not make up their minds or kept changing their orders.  All of Tiffany's recommendations turned out to be perfect. Our first trip to BJs was made all the better because of our waitress Tiffany whose attentiveness was exemplary along with her friendly smile.

29,Jake C.,"Junction City, OR",6,90,8.0,5.0,2017-04-20,"I went to BJ's for the first time with a few co-workers last night. It was very busy when we arrived, but thankfully, we used the BJ's app to get on the waiting list as we left work and we only had to wait a few moments to be seated by the time we arrived. Austin was our server and he was awesome. He was very helpful in choosing drinks and knew all about them. We got them very quickly. In the meantime, I got a good look a the menu. BJ's menu is huge. Much bigger than I anticipated. I am known for being a particularly picky eater, mostly because I don't like cheese or bacon. So many dishes don't really work for me because a regular hamburger is ""elevated"" with cheese and bacon and ends up costing more and I don't want either of those items. Not to worry, as there were items on every single page that I saw that sounded really good. From some seafood, to special salads, tacos, burgers, ribs, steak -- BJ's has an excellent selection even for pickier eaters such as myself. I should mention that some of the prices were a little steep in my opinion; the jumbalaya looked good and I've never had anything like it before, but it was $18.25 and there was a picture of it and the portion didn't look large enough to justify the price. So be aware that you will be plopping down some serious dough more often than not while you are here. My co-workers and I started with the calamari appetizer and it was very good. Normally they taste like whatever they were fried in, but they had their own unique flavor that wasn't too fishy and wasn't too fried. I ended up with a fried jalapeno burger with some different sauces (I told them no pepperjack cheese) and endless fries. On Thursdays this was only $10 which is a good price. The burger was fantastic and cooked exactly as I asked (well done). The fries were seasoned well and were not overpowered. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, but BJ's has a very large selection and was able to make me something I could drink. I actually tried on of my co-worker's strawberry drinks and even though it had twice the alcohol in it, I could barely taste it. That works for me as drink that is too strong isn't very good in my opinion. Austin checked on us several times, took our glasses and trays, and got refills. Even though it was busy we were checked on several times. He even suggested a particular dessert and although we were all full, we were convinced we had to try the pazookis (or however that is spelled). They were also very good and the 3-piece platter worked perfectly for the 4 of us. All in all, I would absolutely go back to BJ's. The ambience is nice, there are lots of televisions so I could watch the playoff basketball and hockey, Austin was awesome, the food was fantastic and there are a lot of dishes that I need to get back in there and try. Just be aware that you are going to pay a pretty penny as BJ's clearly markets itself as a bit more upscale. I thought it was worth the price, but the expense may keep some people from going there more often. Personally, I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2,3.32,3.42,3.42,3.54,3.3800000000000003

Their rewards program is superb and has many offers that allows me to try new things. They have an extensive menu and many choices for all dietary needs or restrictions. The ambiance of this place is great. Eugene needed  a monstrous restaurant in their vicinity. The relocation was an excellent move. Last time I was here, I tried their new prime rib In honor of National Prime Rib day. It was absolutely flawless. A perfect medium rare with a delicious  seasoned crust. I shared it with my dining mate and we were both stuffed beyond reason. It comes with 2 sides, a salad or soup, and a pizookie for $27. Prefect for sharing or for leftovers.  I could go on about the restaurant and it's food but I just say the best part about this restaurant is their staff. Stephanie F., the server, is exquisite; always going above and beyond to enhance my experience. She is so good at anticipating needs and remaining efficient and helpful. Alisa in the bar really knows her stuff and is always so kind, cordial, and efficient that being said, amongst all the wait staff and bartenders I've never had a poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-eugene-2?start=20,3.4,3.47,3.47,3.3160000000000003,3.442

We were here for a friends birthday, which is the only reason we would have eaten here anyway. I started off with a cider on tap, which ended up tasting like a Shirley Temple. Next, we ordered the honey, siracha brussels sprouts which were beyond burned and were flakey leaves, practically like burnt kale chips. We couldn't taste the honey or the sriracha. Our friends tried a bite and agreed. My husband ordered the superfood salad and it was a bunch of kale leaves with maybe some chopped apples and a few blueberries. Not much else, and defiantly not filling. We kept seeing all these huge salads coming by and that just made it all the worse. I ordered the ""enlightened"" barbacoa  cauliflower tacos on pita bread. Last I checked, pita bread isn't the size of street tacos, so each taco was the size of my fist and had cold, shredded cheese on it. The grains that came with it where also cold. My friend's birthday dessert  was so tiny that everybody felt embarrassed to even try a bite of it and she said that they ordered that dessert not too long ago and it was much bigger. This meal was pretty uninspired and left us hungry and disappointed. Everything coming out to around $50 too... This place is not worth the time, money or recognition.

The service was good and the staff were attentive without being overbearing.  We did have to wait quite a long time for our food and dessert, but it was rather busy. The food was acceptable but not extraordinary.  I might even call it ""reliable"" in that I suspect it tastes exactly the same at every location.  That can, however, be a good thing! I ordered the BBQ Smoked Brisket Burger.  The patty was a bit overdone and the bacon quite underdone.  However, the brisket and BBQ sauce were good.  I did order it without onions and it came, you guessed it, with onions.  They were quick to take it back and return with the correct order.  The fries were especially good. We finished with a pizookie which, like the rest of the food, was adequate.  It was big enough to share and a fine finish to the meal.

22,Eric C.,"Eugene, OR",32,61,31.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"We had 2 different groups go to BJ's for work party/rewards dinners in 2 different nights. 1st party half of the people were done eating as the food was arriving for the rest and they were out of their pazookies.  2nd Dinner, they came back after ordering to tell us that they were out of prime rib. When they brought out food they had no idea who got what. One guy got a side of steak because they couldn't figure out where it went.  I ordered the fish and chip, because who can screw that up right? Well, mine had a green marble sitting right in the middle of the plate. No, seriously, a full sized marble. Now a hair or even the tip of a thumb I get (disgusting but I'd get). What is going on in their kitchen that it's even possible for there to be a marble in on my plate. (Photo of marble attached) They guy asked me if I wanted it remade. This is a real question? Really? Anyways, the fries were soggy and the fish was not good. When your company (that for some god forsaken reason keeps ordering from your restaurant regularly) comes in and spends $1000 on dinner for your group (a second time) you think they could get it together but apparently not.
