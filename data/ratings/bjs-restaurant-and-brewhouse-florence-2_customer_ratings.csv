I was hungry and it sounded good. Chicken should have been good, but it was just an end scraggly piece shaped like a thin starfish and overcooked; hard to chew, but I let it pass. Potatoes were delicious. Corn was from a can. Disappointing.  Worse was that I ordered the club soda. And they charged me for it!  I called over waitress who said she would ask manager.  Manager came over and quickly told me that THIS time she would take it off.  she didn't want me thinking that the waitress could just take it off the bill.  What?  I was scolded.

I've had the deep dish before but a different kind and I highly recommend it to anyone. This place has so many good entrées it's rediculous. I've had 5 or 6 different meals and everyone has been very good. The only reason this review is not getting 5 stars is because previous visits. The service has been lackluster.  At first I thought it was because the place was new and they were trying to get their kinks worked out( which I can completely understand) but it wasnt. Granted, we go on Saturday nights and they are fairly busy but it looks like they have enough people working to handle the load.

The hostesses are seldom personable,  remind me is it a hostess responsibility to greet guests?....... Nor do they seem to have a handle on the incoming guests no matter the traffic level. Anyway, we came in to dine at 3:15 on a Saturday. The server took a good 15 min to approach the table after the hostess tried to seat us at a barely 5 person booth with 5 people and a baby. Our drinks took a while and the food took even longer.  Once the food came out, it was not appetizing.  The avavado egg rolls had been under the heat lamp too long, the honey chicken tender salad was slimy and had little to no romaine in it as was advertized. The pizza had burn spots on it as well and toppings only in the center.  Basically, I would skip this location all together.

We spent most of our meal with empty drinks, we couldn't get another server to even look in our direction, and our server looked like she had a whole other section. It wasn't until we were ready for the bill that I walked up to the hostess to let her know we needed to leave. After that our server ran over and offered dessert, which we declined, and then got our bill.

The managers remain well hidden from view and do not present a threat to loafing waiters and bartenders more intent I'm talking to coworkers than waiting on customers. The in-house craft beer selection is horrid however they do have a fine selection of other craft beers if the price remains high for the region. The food is typical bar fare the best being a southwestern style egg roll and an occasional flatbread pizza appetizer.  Entrees are not noteworthy likely due to a menu that is too complex and without focus.

My girlfriend ordered the chicken strips, the order came with so many chicken strips it was crazy. Not sure if it was a normal order or they just gave her extra this time, but it was well worth the menu price, and they were delicious to top it all off.

26,Fredrick C.,"Madison, TN",0,6,,2.0,2016-07-14,"""Sleek gastropub"". Those are the exact words that slid across my lips as we entered the BJ's just outside of the Florence Mall. It really was just a random pick for some grub, but the inside just blew me away. Very nice theme, trendy interior, all leading up to a large bar that claimed the main stage of this restaurant.  We took our seat in the back, far from the drunken howling of a few guys drinking and watching the game. We were greeted and handed menus, while I asked what they specialized in. I was told pizza and that was what I had my heart set on. And both me and my companion decided on a small pizza with half-and-half toppings.   The menu though... that menu was the writing on the wall and I knew it from the second I looked through it. There must've been 13+ pages (going from memory), 3-4 of which were devoted solely to drinks, but still!!! That many things on a menu is almost always an omen for a disaster and well... You know when you try to do too many things at once then just end up doing nothing right? Well, this was that same scenario playing out in my mouth and probably everyone else's. The pizza's crust was then only redeemable quality, crisp and perfectly done. Then comes the clearly low-quality, trucked in cheese and toppings. Go to Kroger and just figure out the crust; it would be the same thing. The sauce... oh, wait.... well, they pretty much didn't use any. Maybe that's how they get the crust right... Dissatisfied with my pizza, I ended up having to order an appetizer of barbecue ribs, which were much more digestible than the abomination I split with my friend; and they were somewhat decent. I began to think that we were supposed to be drunk at the bar to actually enjoy this. I'm still shaking my head about this place... Simply pick a few of your best menu items, use quality ingredients, and do a few things well; trying to do everything only makes everything bad. Where's Chef Ramsay? I need someone to yell about how big the menu is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6320000000000006,2.96

23,Sarah S.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",24,86,55.0,3.0,2016-08-12,"First time here and was disappointed for a few reasons. My mom and I went here for lunch. We started with their salsa and chips for an appetizer because the menu said that the chips were refillable for free. The salsa was very good. We ate through the chips very fast and when our waitress came by she started to take the salsa away and not offer any more chips. A little odd, but easily corrected. So BJ's does have a nice lunch menu with a variety of options but I opted to order pasta from their dinner menu. Their menu, by the way, is overwhelmingly huge. Anyways, I got the baked ziti since our waitress recommended it. When it came to the table, it looked appetizing but I was disappointed by how small it was!! I mean it was a dinner option...and it cost me a whopping $15 for pasta! I should've avoided that cost. It tasted fine but I could tell that the meats used inside where precooked pizza toppings and there was a pool of grease under the noodles. Last, my mom and I decided to try their pizookie. Let me say that the picture on the menu (and on yelp) is very deceiving. They depict this dessert as a deep dish cookie with ice cream on it. In reality, it's just a large cookie, and again it's over priced. It tasted fine but could easily be made at home for a fraction of the cost (same with my pasta). Overall this experience left me with a taste for something more. Basically if you want pasta, go to a pasta place. If you want a burger, go to a burger place. You get the point. What does BJ's specialize in anyways?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.7960000000000003,2.44

21,Doug And Marty Y.,"Burlington, KY",7,13,,1.0,2017-08-19,"Made reservations with front end staff. Was confirmed 8 customers at 6:30. After a one hour delay the manager apologized for his crews failing to turn customers with kitchen, wait, and servers that could accommodate the heavy crowd. Don't frequent this place on ANY busy evening, you will be definitely disappointed. Other restaurants could accommodate your dining requests without being a stressful occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2?start=20,3.12,3.08,3.08,,3.0960000000000005

3,John W.,"Florence, KY",3,40,,3.0,2017-09-23,"Here we go again. Went back to BJs for my sons birthday with mixed results.  Saturday at 4:00pm. Maybe 15% of tables filled. 85% empty.  No one at front desk. Waited about 6 minutes. A girl in BJs uniform comes in front door ,goes behind reception desk, then walks away into bar without saying a word to us.  After 9 minutes total another girl shows up and asks how many. I had used the preferred seating in the apo 35 minutes ahead and requested a table for 5. She asked if a booth was okay. I again requested a table and was told "" We dont have any tables. They are all being prepped for big parties.""  AGAIN, I am looking at 85% empty restaurant. She seems annoyed and says she will see what she can do. The other girl who ignored us earlier shows up and the secing girk says,""Oh good. Seat these people"" and walks away We get seated and the waiter was friendly. We ordered Mahi mahi, Asteak. Parmesan chicken and a Turkey Dip. All were excellent. No issues with food as usual. Thats why we come back.  THEN two other waiters ( I assume) were leaning against the wall behind our table and as another table was seated were LOUDLY saying, "" Why are they seating tables here?"" ""Are they f$@#ing idiots? "" These girls are  F$#/ing stupid. This is bulls$#t"" Im no prude but this was incredibly unprofessional. The waiter took quite awhile to get back to us to bring check and admitted he had forgotten we were there. So food : A+ Waiter: B Other service people we encountered : F Ambiance : F So Im not sure how many times the great food will bring us back considering the rest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,3.04,3.08,3.08,,3.0640000000000005
13,Ryane R.,"Latonia, KY",56,10,,3.0,2017-09-28,"Bj's did not live up to the hype or how I remembered it when I went to the one in Tri County years ago. The service was good, but the food was just okay. The server told us they started off as a pizza restaurant so I figured it would be good to try the pizza. Maybe it was an off night but my pizza was mushy and cold. I was really disappointed. My daughter got the kids spaghetti and said that it was just okay. I mean you can ask much for a kids spaghetti, but overall the food wasn't great. We probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,2.96,3.09,3.09,,3.038

8,Sarah S.,"Burlington, KY",1,16,,5.0,2017-10-23,I've been going to this restaurant for a while now and the food and service has always been wonderful. I love their beer selection and they have great house made sodas.  Last night I had an experience so wonderful that I just had to leave a review. My sister has a lot of food allergies and Elise was so friendly and accommodating to ensure that she could eat well. It is honestly normally very difficult for her to go out to eat and the fact that she not only had options but our server was kind about it was so refreshing. The whole table just absolutely adored her. She was so wonderful and I truly hope BJ's is aware of how lucky they are to have her.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,3.0,3.1,3.1,,3.0600000000000005

My favorite would be the roast beef dip sandwich and potato wedges. I recommend the potstickers for an appetizer. Their drinks are great, too!

9,Kim R.,"Florence, KY",10,13,,1.0,2017-11-12,"We went for Sunday football. They were out of some of the happy hour/game time specials due to their Veteran Day specials. When the Bengals game was over, they switched the sound back to music. We asked for the sound to be switched back to football- we were then accused of drinking too much. I do want to say service was fine, but that is not enough for us to go back to the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,2.96,3.14,3.14,,3.0680000000000005
2,Henry H.,"Lafayette, IN",141,50,,2.0,2017-11-13,"I was in town for a running event and needed to pick up a quick dinner before checking in to my hotel. I had checked online beforehand and noticed a BJ's close by and found a decent sounding meal that I wanted. So I called for an order to be picked up on a Saturday evening, and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. That's not too bad, I thought, so I headed over around that time. Then I waited at the to-go counter. After standing there for five minutes, three employees busted through the door between the counter and kitchen. None of them greeted me, or asked if I had been helped. They had to attend to something obviously more important than a customer. When one of them finally asked me if I needed help, I told them about my order and paid my bill. But my meal (a chicken quinoa bowl) was not ready. It was finally ready about 35 minutes after I called, 15 minutes longer than what I had been told to expect. The chicken quinoa bowl was actually quite good, which is the only redeeming thing about my experience at BJ's.  The incredibly slow and poor service is why I will never go back. Honestly, if I had been told ""sorry for the wait"" or some sort of apology even once, I would be able to look past the long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,2.92,3.13,3.13,,3.046

4,Lindsey D.,"Florence, KY",0,10,2.0,2.0,2018-01-12,"After being seated the server came and took our drink and appetizer order and said the kitchen was backed up so if we were ready to order dinner as well. Drinks came quickly but 40 minutes later no appetizer but waiter had said almost ready. Another 5 minutes and I flag him down and ask about the appetizer which he said he forgot to put in. Okay cancel the appetizer. Finally entrees came and mine, spicy peanut soba noodles, was lukewarm at best, but hey now I'm really hungry so I just want to eat and get out. Husband's burger and fries were good but had to get a busser to bring ketchup. Waited a long time to get the check, husband stood with his coat on hoping someone would get the hint. This place has definitely gone downhill from when they were new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-florence-2,2.92,3.09,3.09,,3.022
