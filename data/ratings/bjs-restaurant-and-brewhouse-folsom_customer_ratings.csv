Cha Ching. Service was excellent as well as the atmosphere. Our waitress was friendly and funny. Our pizza--barbeque chicken minus the tomatoes add some mushrooms. I would ask for light cilantro next time, as it was a little bit too much. My guess is had we gotten the tomatoes it would have been a perfect balance though. If you don't know what a pizookie is, it is a freshly baked cookie (a big one) in a still-hot cookie pan with ice cream. So, in other words, heaven in your mouth.

Now, loose crustaceans on their own do not a two star rating make.  I'm just not that kind of girl.  So let me just add that my salad came after everyone else had already been served their complicated hot food.

By the time our first-course types of meals (soups, salads) were on the table, we'd been there a full hour. The main courses arrived and it was mediocre at best.

My drink never got refilled, and the server didn't ask what kind of fries I wanted (just brought me the shoestring fries when I actually prefer steak fries). We had to remind them a couple of times that it was a birthday celebration, and by the time they brought out the celebratory personal-sized Pizookie, we'd already paid our check and half our party had left to return to work.

236,Joe N.,"Folsom, CA",440,151,36.0,1.0,2012-03-23,"this place has gone down in service and in food quality. I must bother my fellow yelpists with a long story. as a self proclaimed foodie, friends like to accompany my wife and I to eat so they can try new things. a friend who just moved from Arizona and after a long day of shooting and driving around folsom a group of 5 of us built up an appetite, we decided to go to BJ's to watch the bulls game and allow my Arizonan friend try the famous pizzookie. boy was that a mistake. we ordered 3 burgers,  1 fish and chips, 1 nachos for food. Drinks ordered: 1 soda, 3 waters and friend ordered a Jeremiah Red. from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks? 20 mins. from the time we got our drinks to out server to get our orders?+20mins at this point we wanted drinks refilled. this is the time the Red came out. the Hostess not our server finally bring out the food. as soon as she set down the food she knocks over a full cup of water. but instead of truly caring she looks almost annoyed at us, looks at my friend asks him if hes ok. he replies with a yeah, but guess what? the water was totally going the other direction on the table and the person opposite him totally gets drenched, looking like she has loss control of her bladder. while she spills this water she drops part of my wifes fries. all thats left was 5 1/2 fries. but instead of saying hey i'll bring you a new side of fries she just drops the rest of the food off and walks away.  Dang it just writing this makes my blood boil how crappy the service is. eff the story here was everything that was wrong: - service took forever we were there for lunch and it took over 2 hours. -hostess brings out our food spills multiple things gives us a half hearted apology and walks away not even cleaning it. -server is off doing her own thing. comes by maybe 4 times during the duration of our stay.  -all of the burgers were asked for for medium/rare. one burger came out half burnt/half pink. one burger was missing the lettuce tomatoes and onions -we had to wait extra long for our food with no update from our server or refills . -the nachos we had were pretty much chips with cheese, none of the other toppings were on there in any quantity to be considered acceptable. -we ask for the manager it takes another 10 mins, we then complain to the manager, manager makes crap excuses  says he will take care of one of the burgers and then tries to UPSELL us a pizzookie. -we finish food in 15 mins we try to get our check, cant get a hold of our server. dirty plates on our table for another 15 mins. only after i started to take pictures of our food does the manager come by and clear our table. - trying to get the check that the manager had to hand us. he asks us if we wanted a pizzookie my arizonan friend never trying one we agreed. in the end of this disgusting ordeal. We ended up still paying 40 dollars for the meal. manager only comping the burgers and the pizzookie.  i've told everyone i could about this issue and it seems like i am not the only one who had a crap experience like this.

376,Dianne H.,"Placerville, CA",2,23,,1.0,2012-05-04,"Went there with a friend and chose the half baked potatoe and salad. Well let me tell you first of all it says it is half of their giant baked potato. I've seen their giant baked potato and what I got was not even close to ""half"" of that. In fact it was a half of a medium potato, flat as a pancake and not fluffy like a baked potato should be, that told me that it was probably left over from the night before or had been sitting in a warming oven for some time. Okay, next--I ordered it with sour cream and butter and the waitress said well for a few dollars more you can get cheese and bacon on it. The bacon consisted of about 4 chopped up pieces and the cheese was like yellow gooey glue, not in the least bit appetizing. The salad was your garden variety ""pale leaf"" lettuce with a few sliced tomatoes and not much else. Iced tea $2.75. Lunch with tip ended up costing $15.00, a far cry from the $5.95 that I had intended to spend. Well not  their fault as they did not force me to order the iced tea. It could have been so good had the potato really been ""half"" of their ""giant"" one and if it had been fluffy and had not had a glutenous mess of cheese on it. I have been to the BJ's in Elk Grove, what a difference as that one in Elk Grove served up this same dish wonderfully.

We arrived on a Sunday evening (1/20/13 around 8pm) and were promptly seated since the restaurant was half empty (the hostess was great).  Our waiter (and another staff member) were preoccupied with a group of young girls and were unable to provide any service unless prompted.  Our party observed the male waiters flirt with these girls multiple times for long periods while we received little to no service.  We patiently waited for an excess of thirty minutes before we flagged down someone to take our order.  In this half empty restaurant we needed to ask for utensils, refills, order food, and to receive our order.  To add insult to injury the waiter forgot portions of our order.  Frustrated, I approached the staff member and asked  to be helped while he was still flirting with the girls. Needless to say this made the young girls angry. Those girls started to talk about (and make fun of ) our party WITH the waiters. Aware that the girls were young teenagers we disregarded the taunts and attempted to continue our dinning experience. We observed both waiters continually attending to the young girls and joining in on their conversation about OUR party.  This was BY FAR the worst dinning experience of my life.

The waitress brought out only one soup and told us we could share since they were making a fresh batch. That was a little awkward.

It's mellow and slightly skewed toward the malty side of the spectrum. Good show with the brews, BJ's! You earn another star. Of course, that leaves only one star for the rest of the dining experience. Uh, oh... Friday, 5:15 on a scorching hot afternoon: My wife and I enter BJ's Folsom location with healthy appetites and driving thirsts. We start with appetizers and a couple beers. Our server brings the beer, but mistakenly serves us each the wrong one. To be fair, the Oasis and Hopstorm have similar color when served. The two taste so different that I notice the error immediately and we switch our pints. No harm done. The restaurant isn't very busy yet, so we see most of the wait staff, including our server, congregating together chatting amongst themselves at one station near the rear of the dining area, opposite the bar. Remember the appetizers I mentioned earlier? Our server didn't. 45 minutes go by until she returns to the table to tell us the appetizers should be up soon, and by the way, are we ready to order our entrees? We place our dinner orders. A few minutes later, our appetizers arrive... cold. Our server, who was standing nearby, must have overheard us talking about it. She came back and said, ""Oh, are they cold?"" (Anyone think she doesn't already know they're cold? Neither do I.) Anyway, she does the right thing by getting us new appetizers and not charging for one of them. Soon after, warm appetizers arrive. Hooray! But wait, our entrees are ready, too. What a predicament. Eat the hot entrees and let the now-warm appetizers get cold again, or eat the appetizers and let the entrees go cold? Heck, I think I need another Hopstorm. Where did our server go? Looking around, I see that the staff is no longer aimlessly loitering about and that the Manager is in the house. Coincidence? I managed to order another beer, and we proceed to devour the surprisingly good food we are finally served, followed up with Chocolate Pazookie for desert (which my wife ordered, since I refuse to say the word ""Pazookie"" out loud) So, after all was said and done, it ending up being a nice -  wait a minute... what's this?

Our drinks came out pretty quickly however  We again waited another 10-15 mins for chips & salsa to arrive.  There was 3 adults eating and she brings up a small bowl of salsa with not alot of chips.  Instead of taking our order then, she dropped off our chips and left. Finally another 10-15 mins later she decided to stop off at our table to take our order. By this time we had finished off our chips and salsa and asked for more. After about 5 mins and seeing her walk by our table and not saying anything I caught her atten to asked our out salsa & chips. She said they ran out and had to make more..... Our orders were pretty simple, a salad, sandwich and the BBQ special you have currently going on. We waited another 15-20 mins before our meals were brought out by someone other than our waitress. Still no salsa or chips. I said something to the gal who brought out our food.  She seemed surprised when I told her we were still waiting for fresh salsa to come out as our waitress said they ran out. Amazingly she left and was back in less then 2 mins with fresh salsa & chips. By this time we now had our food and wasn't hungry for the chips & salsa. But at $5.99 for a cup of salsa and a small about of chips, you bet I'm asking for seconds. What a rip off!!  Only saving grace was the salsa was pretty good.  After receiving our food we waiting another 10 mins before she stopped by to see how our food was and if we needed anything else. That was pretty much the last time we saw here except to walk by our table to help others tables around her.  Finally I caught her atten to ask for our check. It was closed to 3pm and we wanted out of there!  2 hrs for lunch???  Really??  When I asked for the check nicely she gave me a look  and said ""I was just going to ask you if you want and dessert?"" with attitude.

What I realized shortly after was that they probably forgot to season the coleslaw so they just hit it with some cumin after the fact. Tasted like crap. I ordered a side of fries as well. They came out about one minute before I finished my burger The person who returned the salmon received their bison burger. The patty looked phenomenal compared to mine, but they had no seasoning at all on the coleslaw.  What I've realized is that BJ's is awesome for appetizers and good brews.

106,Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",3358,493,984.0,4.0,2014-03-09,"BJ's has one of the biggest menus of any restaurant in the area. You can satisfy pretty much any craving here.  If you only get one thing, get a pizooki: an amazing soft gooey cookie served to you hot in the cast iron it was just cooked in, topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The best flavors are white chocolate raspberry and red velvet. I haven't tried it yet, but they now have a gluten-free pizooki, too.  The pizzas are really good. The crust is a little bit on the thicker side, but is really flavorful, and doesn't have that bread-y taste that some pizzas have. My personal favorite is the sweet pig pizza. The wedge salad here is one of my favorite salads anywhere. It probably has a ton of calories, since it's smothered in bleu cheese, but it's amazing. Maybe what makes it so good is that it's literally a quarter wedge of a lettuce head, so it's really fresh, as opposed to shredded lettuce which is allowed to be prepared well before it's served. The giant baked potatoes are pretty legit, but they are really truly giant. I'd recommend either splitting, or getting a half order with soup or salad. The house beers are amazing. My last four paragraphs started with the same word because I had a Jeremiah Red earlier. Word to the wise, they will let you sample small servings of beer for free, so you can make sure you like it before you buy it. The avocado egg rolls here are not the best ever, but they are pretty legit. The only problem is that sometimes the avocado is over-ripe (I've had this happen probably 1/3 of the time).  This is a good location. Even though they are always packed, they seat pretty quickly, they are usually very clean, and the staff has great customer service in spite of the fact that they all appear to be under 18.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=80,3.24,2.96,2.96,3.248,3.0720000000000005

Took a while to get seated, so I got to view some of the dinners coming out and I was all about the Asian salad, so that is what I ordered for dinner. It was a long wait, so we had an appetizer platter. It was pretty average, nothing really special. Then our dinner came out and I got this lame salad that was the size of a salad you have with your dinner. I felt as if they gave me the bottom of the barrel, what was barely left over and didn't want to take the time to make me something decent. It definitely did not look like the same salad these people got at the bar I was next to. I even asked them what salad it was. My sister ordered the same salad and it was the same issue and hardly any dressing on it. It took forever to get the waiter, we had to ask the water boy if he would get her for us. It took her a bit to get over to us and then we told her what was going on. She said she was ""sorry"" and I told her it wasn't her fault, but because we had to wait so long, I did not want my salad at all. She said she would go get us more dressing, but I told her again that the salad was not what we asked for. Then the manager comes over and asks if he can do anything for us and I said ""no thank you"", because the wait was a long time and I had lost my appetite. He explained they ran out of the fixings for the salads and that was why it was so small and he also said they were out of the dressing. I would had much rather they come out and tell us they were out of that type of salad and check and see if we'd like to order something else. What a bunch of BS. My g/f had the fried chicken.

Several minutes later, the server came back and told us the manager had re submitted our orders and our food would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later or so later, our order came out.  They obviously made NO extra effort to get our food out to us since the thin crust pizzas too longer to get out than the deep dish.  At least, this time our food was perfect.

I ordered take out this evening and it didn't go well. The order: 1 Nacho 1 Pale Ale Chili 1 Beef Sliders 1 Avocado Egg Roll 1 Pepsi The problem - when I arrived at the curb side takeout, I called the number and it took quite a while just to get someone to pickup the phone.  Irritating but not the main complaint. The chips of the nachos were covered with the mix and thrown in a tin.  Maybe I'm asking too much but I have come to expect through my to-go orders that the chips and the mix are separated so you don't end up with nacho soup.   The bowl of Pale Ale Chili would have been great if I wasn't given a cup. The beef sliders were missing everything but the lettuce and pickle.  According to the online menu, I'm missing onions and ketchup. The avocado egg rolls didn't taste like they usually do, some how between the spices and cooking process, the avocado tasted metallic ( two others verified this, unprompted and I didn't ask a loaded question; ""Like does it taste like metal?"", the plus side being I know I'm not completely nuts.   The Pepsi.  This was ridiculous.  I ordered a Pepsi, that was $2.95.  I knew it might be quite over priced.  Wow was I off.  The plastic cup that I was given is smaller than a red SOLO cup.  Oh and they were out of lids, so the whole way home I played don't spill the soda.   Short of wanting ""A Drink Like That"" - I will never be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=120,3.16,3.24,3.24,2.372,3.2080000000000006
127,Rose G.,"Folsom, CA",2296,167,106.0,5.0,2015-01-06,"BJ's is one of those restaurants that you actually appreciate the fact it is a chain.  From the moment you pull in to the parking lot you know you will have a good experience. The parking lot is never full as they have ample parking, even though it shares it with other businesses. Sometimes there may be a wait for a table on a weekend night, but the front of house is run smoothly and efficiently so you never have to wait long. The longest i have ever waited for a table was 6-10 minutes during dinner rush on a saturday night on a holiday weekend. That in itself says a lot about the restaurant. As you get seated in a COMFORTABLE AND PRIVATE BOOTH OR TABLE, you are immediately greeted by your server and they have a wide selection of craft beers, unique cocktails, and the usual array of soft drinks, etc. I always recommend trying their house made root beer or one of their cocktails,  Their menu's signature dishes are always superb, and range from classic burgers to GLUTEN FREE pizza, to pasta dishes and health conscious dishes. I ALWAYS bring large groups here as not only do they have ample space for large parties, but they have such a diverse menu, there is literally something for everyone. They also have SEASONAL MENU ADDITIONS which are just a delicious as their regular items. Some personal favorite dishes are the WATERMELON and FETA SALAD, the SPINACH AND ARTICHOKE DIP, the CAJUN PASTA, the ENLIGHTENED SCALLOPS, and BBQ BISON BURGER. Oh, and of course you have to cap off your evening with a PIZOOKIE, I am a fan of their GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP.  Service is always excellent, even on busy nights, and being a regular I believe i have been served by all of their waitstaff. They always have a smile on their face, they are FAST AND PROMPT, and in the past year of going maybe once every couple weeks I have only had one small error to an order. Food is usually out quickly, and you never feel stranded after your food is served. Their hours are amazing, one of the only open past 10pm establishments in the Folsom area.

239,Jillian O.,"Camino, CA",3,4,,2.0,2015-01-21,"My last two visits to this particular BJ's were less than satisfactory. Last night in particular was probably the worst. We had a party of 10 and they told us there would be a short wait due to a party just finishing up and just paid. Apparently in their eyes ""finishing up"" means 30minutes +. We finally got tired of waiting since it was getting later than we wanted and they could only seat our party in two booths next to each other. Not ideal when the guests of honor couldn't even sit with one another. Finally after getting our drinks (wrong I add, and with getting a new server right after ordering drinks) we ordered our food and they were able to move our group to a table where everyone was able to sit together. One appetizer finally came, but my salad I had ordered to come out before my entree never showed up. Once the food arrived luckily MOST everything was correct. I had to ask for my salad which did come out correct. Another person's order was the complete wrong item, and the server said ""I'm sorry, I heard you talking about another item so I thought you just wanted that"".  I feel part of the issue is the switching of servers, and other servers bringing out food to tables they have no idea what they ordered. This is not the first time the orders have been mixed up and I've only experienced it at BJ's. Also, if you no longer make the boneless wings, take them off the menu!

The greeting was genuine and we truly felt welcome here. She greeted and seated us. We asked what was good and she made a quick recommendation before going back to her host stand!  Almost instantly after being seated, a friendly server came to the table. Her name was Stephanie. She explained the menu to us and made recommendations. We asked for shrimp cocktail which she was very sad to announce that they didn't have. She did offer to talk to the manager and the chef to ask if they could make it for us but we said that was ok.  We ordered the soup in the bread bowl and it was delicious! It had to have been the best tasting bread bowl that I had in awhile. It was the perfect lunch for someone who is not wanting a full meal!

Isaac then left our table looking overwhelmed. We wanted to order by then we have been in the restaurant for a half an hour without food. He finally comes back to our table and then takes our order. My friend and I wanted a Cesar salad before our meal came out. It came out yet another ten minutes. Plus no Cesar dressing was on the salad. So I wasn't just going to eat lettuce. I asked Isaac for dressing since my salad had none on it. I timed him with my fitbit timer and my sister was just so embarrassed that it was her 21st birthday dinner with her friends and she was getting so disrespected by bjs. Isaac then comes over with a pazookie and asks if her name was Danielle. I said no that is my name her name is becca. Just an over all worst experience I have had at bjs. We left no tip because why should we? We were at bjs for over 2 hours... plus the table behind us was upset with Isaac also because he messed up a cheeseburger twice the lady manager looked so annoyed I didn't want to bother telling her why we were upset also.

340,Marti A.,"CA, CA",0,14,,2.0,2015-08-06,"The oxymoron here is that BJ's, up until recently, would always get a 5 star review from us!  The lunch crowd gave us the first clue.  Usually, this restaurant is standing room only at lunch and dinner times.  Today it was, conspicuously, rather empty. In spite of the sparse lunch crowd, the first obvious difference was the slow service.  Then, we noticed the lack of condiments on the table.....only salt and pepper.  One must ask for sugar for iced tea, etc.  Finally, we placed our order. Mine,  (the lunch) Southern  fried chicken and my husband's, a small flat bread pizza with a salad.  The chicken was a small, thin and dry piece on top of a HUGE mound of potatoes with a small dollop of gravy.  This is accompanied by a corn mix scattered around the potatoes.  It was difficult to cut the chicken, it was so dry and hard.  The potatoes were tasty but dry without gravy to enhance them and the corn was like an afterthought. Usually, this is a small (but visible) piece of chicken on a small mound of potatoes on top of a nice portion of the corn mix.  The gravy usually drips down over the potatoes.  All very tasty!  The veggies compliment the chicken, potatoes and gravy as a Southern dish should.  The pepper gravy is so good that I always request a small side to augment the standard.  The lunch item I was served today made me feel as though we were in the wrong restaurant.....no comparison!  My husband's lunch was a small salad which was mostly slivered carrots, instead of lettuce, and his flat bread pizza was extremely greasy. Please know that we have had these items before and that they were delicious and well prepared.  We do not expect haute cuisine at BJ's but, we have always enjoyed the good service, outstanding food, atmosphere, camaraderie and reasonable prices which have all been consistent.  We are hoping that there has been a glitch in the system where, perhaps, the accountant decided to take over the BJ protocols? or, the CFO?  We fervently hope that whoever designed the ""NEW"" image for BJ's, has since been replaced with the old model!!  We would rather pay more and leave with a happy heart and a satisfied palate.  We plan to return before searching for a new favorite.  We are members of BJ's Premier Rewards and would like to keep this as our 'go to' standard.   Marti and Al",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=280,2.64,3.14,3.104,3.0160000000000005,2.9400000000000004

I do feel like it should be a little longer and whats with the two seat low corner on the end?..... Oh well, all of that really doesn't matter because the service, and the food were amazing. The menu is somewhat of a book that can be a little tough to navigate but believe me if you are hungry take the time to read it. If you are a craft brew fanatic this is a good stop so put it on your list. I ordered the wings with the xxxxtra hot buffalo sauce. The sauce wasn't as hot as the menu would lead you to believe but as a wing addict these were very good. I give BJs Brewhouse 4 stars, the atmosphere is inviting and there is something for everyone to enjoy.

Love that the tvs are on mute and there is decent music playing.  Constant/attentive service.  And the mini pizookie blows doors.  I feel like the bar should be longer, but I understand it's a limited space. Whoever the bartender is on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings is wonderful. He is mellow and his vibe is ideal. They have a killer Bloody Mary and mimosa brunch special. The well vodka for the bloody is Absolute and you can upgrade to kettle for around a $1 and some change. Score!

The house Hefeweizen was pretty tasty, but not enough to warrant a refill.  I think the correlation between taste and price is where BJ's beer falls short.  The beers are reduced from $6.50 to $5.50 for Happy Hour.  If the house beers were exceptional this would be a great deal, but the house beers are too generic to make the brewery a destination.  Think of BJ's as a Chili's or an Applebee's that brews its own corporate beer.  If you want to drink something unique or complex, BJ's probably won't have it.  If you want a beer that's not Budweiser to go with your meal, BJ's will suffice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=160,3.16,3.13,3.1,2.732,3.142

286,S B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,63,32.0,3.0,2016-06-24,"Let's say you are, driving across the country. You've been driving all day, you're tired. You're hungry. You need something to eat. You know what you like. You like burgers and fries. You stop at McDonald's because they all look the same and you know exactly what you're getting, whether you're in San Diego or Atlanta. If you have time to look stuff up and maybe check your Yelp or something then you find the place that does crawdads or bison steaks. That's... why you go to BJ's. You know exactly what you're getting. It's a known commodity. That said, BJ's, and chain brew pubs like them have always been an anomaly to me. If all I want to do is eat, I'll go to Burger King. If all I want to do is eat, and I want to go to a nice place, I'll go to a nice place to eat. If I want to hang around and drink, I'll go to some old, rustic pub with some character to it. Bricks. Real bricks. Massive wooden timber trusses. The thing about BJ's, and the strip malls in which they sit, is that Scotty can teleport you to one in Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, or wherever they have these things and you wouldn't have a clue where you were because they all look exactly the same, and they all have the aroma of fresh stucco and construction adhesive. Kind of like the rest of the strip mall, as well as the oversized, overpriced, slapped together in a hurry tract homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the area. Which is fine and all, except... the place isn't cheap. It's kind of pricey, for what it is. The food is fine, I can usually manage to order up something that will fit within my special dietary requirements and enjoy it most places, and this place is no exception, but food wise, although it's better than Denny's, it isn't much better. It still has the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria, and, well there are the TV's. Obviously I've gone there, and more than once, but generally I'm with a group or it's someone else's idea. If I'm meeting someone for whatever reason, the place really doesn't matter. Otherwise, if I'm hanging out, I'm not going to be in the middle of suburbia anyway, so I guess a BJ's wouldn't be applicable. Don't take this as a negative. It's a fine place to bring a group of people. Be prepared to drop some coin. The menu is big enough most people can be accommodated. Also, they are a brew pub, so if thick, sugary, syrupy, overly-hopped craft beers are your thing (and there are lots of people that do like them) then this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=100,3.0,3.1,3.096,2.732,3.0600000000000005

In the past (when I didn't care about my calorie intake lol) I would almost always get their pasta because it is just so good. Lately though I've been more conscious of how many calories I take in so that's where I'm grateful that they have a ""light"" section in their menu and it actually offers a lot more choices than other places I've been to. I normally order a chicken or their shrimp pasta from there but when we were there last on Sunday I decided to try one of their salads because I've never had one here before. My family and I came in on Sunday and it was beyond crowded. Despite that, our waitress was still very attentive and sweet. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it was a kale salad with a strawberry vinaigrette. It also came with brussel sprouts and sprinkles of grapes and blueberries. I personally wasn't a fan of the salad because kale and brussel sprouts are naturally bitter and topping that with the sour vinaigrette just didn't taste pleasant to me so I'm never going to order that again lol. The grapes and blueberries definitely offset that though, being as sweet as they were so thankfully that was on the plate. My family and I always order the wings that come with a side of buffalo sauce and ranch as appetizers and those are always super good and crispy. My mom always gets the clam chowder in a bread bowl and I always take some of that because I love how crunchy their bread is and when dipped in the soup it's sooo good (literally drooling rn).

Unfortunately I was the one who did not enjoy my meal... First, I ordered wine and the glass had lipstick all over it and was handed to me by the waiter and he poured the carafe of wine into my filthy wine glass .... I pointed out the lipstick and he did take my wine glass and my carafe of wine and brought me a new glass and a carafe. Second, I always cut my burgers in half because I usually cannot eat a full burger... When I cut my burger in half it crumbled because it was so over cooked and it was a Blue cheese burger and I swear I could not taste any blue cheese. I even asked the waiter if they put blue cheese on it and he said yes and a chipotle sauce. My friend ordered the regular hamburger and hers was pink and juicy however her fries look like they were cooked three or four times she could not even eat them... day old fries... we laughed because they looked horrible.

I would rather them offer that promotion instead of acting like they did us a favor for giving us $10 off. Seemed kind of fake but oh well.

Not only did I find something, I had a hard time narrowing it down!  I finally decided on a pizza, the two people I was with getting a salad and a burger. When our food came I was really blown away by the obvious food quality. You could see (and taste!) the freshness of our food that it really usually lacking in most other places. Not only was our food great but the service was too! Our server (I can't find the receipt for her name, I'm sorry!!) was nice, polite, and attentive to all our needs despite the busy time of day (Sunday, brunch/lunch, short wait, full house) But the whole reason I came here to review is our great service started at the door. I for the life of me can't remember his name (tall, blonde ponytail, super nice!) but our host was awesome, he made great conversation on the way back to our table, and even stayed to finish our conversation after we were seated that one of my guests thought he was our server! Most places the host throws down your menus and runs away so this was a great change. Definitely give this place a try, with this quality of food and amazing service you won't be disappointed.

(our server was Aishani) I ordered a raspberry sparkling lemonade which the server confirmed, she brought back two waters. Never got that drink. She never checked on us once we got our food. My husband had half of his fries left so asked her if he could get another side of BBQ sauce .... ten minutes later (after serving other tables) she came over and asked if we would like any dessert. I said ""no but can we get that side of BBQ sauce?"" Five minutes later.... after she'd served two other table multiple times.... still no BBQ sauce. So I stopped another server and asked her if we could get some... she went straight to the kitchen and came right back out with our sauce. Yay. I think her name was Sam.  On the other hand our regular server came right after saying I see Sam got you the sauce.  :|  yes she did. And later Sam even asked us if we wanted a refill on our waters which our regular server did not, not even once. And now we're going to see how long it is until she comes to pick up the check so we can leave. It's already been about five minutes. Oh look Sam took it for us what a great server she is.

First, if you like having ""drinks"" with your meal, good luck.  We've experienced nothing but inconsistent serves.  So much so, we don't know what to expect anymore.  We were once served a double in the same size glass as a single at the same sitting.  When confronted, the server (and manager) tried to explain it off by saying it was due to the amount of ice in the glass!  lol...  I don't know why they're so funky about alcohol serves, but they are.  If this is important to you, don't hold your breath. Second, food delivery is a big problem.  Do not order your appetizers with your mains.  For sure, you will get them all at the same time - no matter if you ask your server not to serve them together.  You're only hope is to order them separately (if you want them separately). Lastly, it is all but guaranteed someone at your table is going to get served cold food.  I know and appreciate that it can be a challenge to coordinate everyone's meal to come up at the same time, but it seems they have given up trying long ago.  Doesn't matter if your group is large or small, someone is going to get the short end of the stick.  Hot french fries??????  We let that expectation go, long ago. Basically, if you get the proper BJ's experience, you're lucky!  When you do, it's enough to make you keep trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40,3.08,3.21,3.2,2.568,3.158

I've eaten here plenty of times, both inside and takeout, and here's why this particular BJ's is getting 2 stars. Positive: Waiters, waitresses, and hosts are always nice. I have no issue with the customer service whatsoever, they have always been great. 1st Negative: Takeout is NEVER on time. When you say 20-25 mins and take 45-60, that's not cool. And it happens literally every time. The one that sticks out in my mind is when I waited over 50 mins in the takeout area for my food (a burger and chicken). And this was in addition to the 25 minutes that they said it would take. I'm a pretty patient person, but that's just insane. During that time all I was offered was a cup of water. Wonderful. 2nd Negative: The food itself. In the restaurant, the quality is fine. If you order takeout, it's awful. I have gotten soggy eggrolls, cold fries, overcooked and undercooked steaks, wilted salad, cold mashed potatoes, and burnt burgers. I live 5 mins from BJ's, doubt the drive caused any of that. 3rd Negative: The orders are always, always messed up. Sides of sauce are always missing, entree sides are usually wrong, modifications (i.e. no pickles) are forgotten, etc. And I totally understand that this happens sometimes, it's no big deal. But this happens every time. Every. Time.  So, BJ's, I tried to like you, but I don't. I think the kitchen may be the issue, but I really don't know. At this point, I'm over it.

82,Ram G.,"Folsom, CA",2,46,13.0,3.0,2017-10-02,"Our family of 4 were there yesterday October 1st for dinner. This is not the first time we went here. In general, we wait for 30 - 45 minutes to be seated. We heard about the Bj's app to get on the priority waiting list? Any way that was useless because our name was never on the list after we reached the restaurant. Fortunately, there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was Mr. Steve and he was absolutely great.  We ordered one cocktail, and 2 soft drinks between 4 of us. After the drinks arrived, we also placed an order for 3 appetizers (tortilla chips with spinach & artichoke dip (yum), Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls ( the best and dish unique to BJ's), 2 Entrees ( 2 Shrimp and Asparagus penne). The food was great, hot and delicious. Service by Steve is Immaculate. So why am I giving 3 instead of 5 stars. Here is the reason: One of the waitress (don't know the name) got our Entree's before the appetizers. When we asked her why, she asked us, ""do you want me take this back?"" Really? To my understanding, the word appetizer means: "" a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal to stimulate one's appetite."" Then Steve came and he was at least honest and told us why there was this mix up. Oh! yeah, We got a free Pizookie (white chocolate macadamia cookie) for registering our app. I may be severe with my 3 star rating. If I have the option, I would give 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom,2.96,3.09,3.168,,3.038
81,Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",128,171,35.0,1.0,2017-10-08,"Having been to this and other locations, this is so far my least favorite... I've been here twice, a fairly long time ago and a few weeks ago for takeout.  Although my first visit was probably a year ago, I still remember it fairly well, as if it was yesterday, so that could've changed, but more or less, this is a blended review from both visits combined. The service was probably some of the worst I've received, ever.... it was fairly slow when I came here. I'm not sure if our waitress had a bad or an off day, or maybe she was new, or just didn't want to be there. It took us a while to get our orders in. The drinks took almost 20 mins to come out. One of the appetizer came out before the drinks, while the second appetizer never came out at all, nor did the soup. Although they made it to the final bill, which we had to fix, which probably caused another 15-20 minutes delay, I can say I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for something that I never got.... the food was pretty good, although they did get the order wrong, completely missing the few special requests I made.  My second visit was for take out, since the food was decent the first time, but the service was bad and I really didn't want not have an extra couple hours to spare... this was completely the opposite experience. They were friendly, helpful, attentive, getting the order right, getting me out on my way quickly! The food this time however was the complete opposite... we ordered pasta, jambalaya and a couple of appetizers. The appetizers were decent (not as good as the first time), the entrees were mediocre at best. We might as well went to the grocery store down the street, went to their frozen food section and it would've been better and cheaper. We couldn't even finish the entrees aside from a few bites...  All in all, the 1 star rating is a blended reflection of what I've experienced in the couple of times I've been here. If I ever have to come out to this place, I will probably make sure to drive an extra 20-30 mins, to get to a different location, as I've had better experiences at those...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom,2.92,3.09,3.164,,3.022
58,E.S. M.,"Pine Grove, CA",9,4,1.0,1.0,2017-11-01,"My wife Vicki and I have eaten at B.J, s. in Folsom almost since they opened always high marks from our experiences. Even bought gift cards and beer glasses to take home and give as gifts.  But yesterday Oct.31 2017 at around 4:00pm was different.  If you were there did you notice how slippery and unsafe the floors were and no ""Slippery Be Careful"" caution signs. Did you fall or almost fall? The management was very neglect in my opinion by not addressing the very real safety matter of the slippery floors throughout the restaurant  We were a party of four and no sooner did we start to walk to our tables when my wife slipped and fell hard on the floor. Hours later at Sutter Hospital in Jackson she was diagnosed with a fractured knee cap(patella) in med terms.  Management said the floors were cleaned last night and although appeared helpful they were not acknowledging the dangers of the slippery floors. Or indicated any remedy to prevent others from falling and getting injured. If you fell or notices the slippery floors.

92,Michelle T.,"Folsom, CA",5,4,1.0,1.0,2017-11-05,"BJs remains the most overrated Resturaunt in Folsom. We ordered take out and while family completely understands that comes with an understanding that the food won't be as good as when you go in, it was an overall awful experience. From the time I called in to actually getting home with my food it was BAD. Had to call back 3 times cause I was put on hold each time for over 5 min each time. I was told the wait was 20 min to get my food and in the end it was an hour waiting. My kids meals were missing things, when I got home the chicken was cold that we ordered and my husband had no onions, cheese or fries with his French dip. Biggest waste of time and money and this remains not the first time.  We will never go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom,2.84,3.09,3.152,,2.9899999999999998

One child was jumping around and stomped on my foot, but when I announced that the child had stomped on my foot and asked whose child it was, nobody claimed to be the parents.

The burger was good, really enjoyed the spicy flavor, the broccoli was gross.  The broccoli was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted old.   My other half ordered the  black and bleu burger. It's beef patty with chipotle, bleu cheese, bacon, grilled onions, tomatoes, on a Parmesan-crusted bun with roasted garlic aioli and fries.    Again burger was spot on good but the fries were lukewarm and tasted old.

They weren't even booked up, and after the Hostess asked the Manager for permission to reserve a table for a party of twelve, the Manager on duty decided not to allow it. We then called Pete's Pizza in El Dorado Hills, and they were, as always, more than happy to accomodate us.

What a horrible decision.  The estimated time was very reasonable, however, the actual time was three times the wait. The food was well packed and we assumed was still warm, since it did take extra long to prepare. We took the food out of the bags, after the short trip home, to find every item ordered ice cold. The shrimp was shrivelled up, the pizza's cheese was hard, the french fries were  hard, and the cajan pasta and chicken came with some surprise shrimp. Over all, was a horrible meal, I expected much better quality; so disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom,2.64,3.03,3.116,,2.8739999999999997

86,Andrew A.,"Pollock Pines, CA",56,180,419.0,4.0,2017-12-17,"You know, BJ's is BJ's...a chain Brewhouse/restaurant with an extensive menu for both food and the brews. This review is strictly for our lunch/food experience today. Suzan, our waitress was a gem and took really good care of us. She was friendly, personable and very accommodating.  Ordered an appetizer to start. The Siracha Brussels sprouts. I highly recommend this dish. Not too spicy and the sprouts were cooked perfectly...still had just a bit of a crunch to them. My wife ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. Middle of the road chowder but the bowl was exceptional. I had a good time eating what was left of the bowl after she was done. She also had a small ceasar salad...again middle of the road but damn decent nonetheless. I opted for the Mahi-mahi fish tacos. I don't think that there is such a thing as a bad taco. If there is, I have not been introduced to it. My tacos today were a little different in that they came in a light pita shell. Ingredients were on point but the shells were a little too soft and doughy in the middle and a little too crunchy around the edges. A minor issue because if I am being completely honest, I would probably eat a plate of tacos even if the shells were completely made of cardboard. I told you...I love tacos that much! No pics of food today because the football game had all of my attention. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom,2.76,3.08,3.144,,2.9520000000000004

The waiter was very quick and our drinks never got low. The food was friggin awesome. The portions are to big for any of us to eat it all. And all I had was salad. They need to do something about the floor. I almost busted my ass walking and I wasn't the only one, several people complained about it. If I were drinking I know I would have busted my butt.

It was very busy but we scored one of the last booths in the bar and were greeted promptly, water and drinks came and orders taken perfectly. Even with the happy hour signs staring at us we figured we were out of luck since not on Saturday. But alas we were informed by our server that happy hour was on since an NFL game. How great is that!  So four of us chowed down on deep dish, mini-pizzas for 1/2 off, chips and queso and a full-size burger with fries for $6. Food came out piping hot without much wait and our server did a nice job checking in on us. Pizzas were excellent and the burger had nice toppings; not the best beef ever but decent.
