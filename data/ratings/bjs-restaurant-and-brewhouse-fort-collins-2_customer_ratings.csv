98,Cherie K.,"Fort Collins, CO",87,16,,1.0,2013-06-30,"there really should be a way to give ""no stars"" on this....just for this restaurant.  Compared to the other reviews, there was absolutely no wait for two people at around 1p.m. on a Saturday afternoon...however, we now wish that there had been, as it may have saved us time and money that we wasted on this place.  We started out with Bonesless Buffalo Wings, which were o.k. and could have gotten much cheaper elsewhere.  When we placed our order, the waiter acted like we had three heads, when my husband ordered a hamburger according to his dairy allergy.  His exact quote was, "" ALL YOU WANT, is a hamburger with pickles and bacon?""  He gave my pizza to the guy behind us, his to someone else and I got someone else's entirely.  It took FOREVER to get the food.  My husband got their specialty sodas and it was disgusting....syrupy and super sweet with virtually no carbonation.  $40 later, for lunch for two people.....we were disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=80,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

83,Catherine S.,"Loveland, CO",3,8,,1.0,2013-07-04,"This Place needs to get it together, big time! We arrived and there was a long wait, about a half hour...we were thinking it must be good if everyone would wait this long. Once seated a very cheerful wait staff server took our order... Then the madness started... We watched in horror as the wait staff scrambled around us running, dropping and forgetting things...it was unbelievable as this is suppose to be a professional establishment and they just  couldn't handle a full house, that was a bad sign right there! I almost felt sorry for them....until it took them 45 minutes to get our drinks that were not good and another 45 minutes after to get our burned entrees... It seemed as though it could have been a good sandwich under all that charcoaled bread...and so amazing that it actually left the kitchen like that...and we were told they didn't have a dinning room manager that night, but a kitchen one...go figure!...no excuse!....none the less it was an unpleasant experience..... We were so hungry by then we had to eat so we wouldn't pass out from the hunger as we couldn't possibly have wait another hour to have them fix them!....plus when we told our server, she said she would be right back and didn't show up till fifteen minutes later to try and fix the problem. I was actually shocked  when we got our bill of $68. ( this place is not cheap ) and they didn't comp the burned sandwiches, it was their mistake! and we had to pay for it!!...I call that obnoxious! Amazing as most decent places would have taken it off the bill....and to make people wait that long for their food on top of it all! They were very much aware that people were waiting a long time and apologized! but still the real apology to me would have been to comp the food they ruined! I shared this with our neighbors only to find that they too had a similar experience. Bottom line....it took over an hour and a half to get our Burned entrees, 45 minutes to get our drinks...which were too sweet and syrupy BTW...we ordered the ( root beer ) and my Husband the margarita...our son had water ( which is the safest thing there so far )...anyway it was just the three of us so three drinks and they couldn't handle it! Burned food, charging us extra for someone else's beer, not comping your own mistakes...BJ's need to get it together, this should Never Happen to anyone! Also I had to add this...They profess on their website a quality Promise to their customers...will they broke it!!! Bj's deservers NO STARS from us for this experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=80,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

I called ahead for seating and was pleasantly surprised that our table with high chair was completely ready to go on our arrival time. We had Courtney as our server and she was delightful. Very easy going and was always prompt with service. I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos and I really enjoyed them. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as well. It was a very nice, low-key dinner. The food was great, the service was excellent and all of our beers and mixed drinks were spot on. My wife received a complimentary Peanut Butter Pizookie and it was delicious. We've enjoyed the Boulder location in the past and so far this store hasn't disappointed. For the people who had a bad experience, there's no excuse for that on their end, but I would say you could chalk some of it up to growing pains since this location is still brand new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=80,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
57,Bob S.,"Denver, CO",39,135,4.0,3.0,2013-07-29,"With so many powerful chain restaurants springing up across Colorado, it becomes more challenging to develop a clear level of support versus the independent owned microbreweries. BJ's is spacious, modern, large wall mural, many flat screened type of sports brewery with very good service in the bar seating area, However, I thought pricing was expensive for the money-two very small rather ordinary fish tacos on too soft shells was $10.99, tasteless, not much fish and some cole slaw thrown on the top.

53,Anthony J.,"Fort Collins, CO",39,70,54.0,3.0,2013-08-14,"BJ's Brewhouse is a classy brewpub, by appearances mostly.  The décor smacks of that sort of model home design where everything was built from a catalog.  I say this in a matter-of-fact way, but not at all to infer that there is anything inherently wrong with that.  Clearly, mega corporations and deep-pocket investors can make a restaurant shine with all of the granite and brushed nickel accents money can buy.  However, let's not get too distracted from what we came to this place for: the beer and food (yes, in that order)!   If you come for the beer you might be disappointed.  Their options are the basic styles you would find sitting in the grocery store's 3.2% ABV section.  Wheat, Pale Ale, Red Ale, Amber Ale, Porter, Stout and a few others, but nothing really adventurous or notable by other CO brewery standards.  I've tried several of their offerings and I there is nothing great in the quality either.  Each style they had tasted a bit bland and boring.  Sure, they were good enough to have with your meal, but not worth making a trip to have by themselves. As for the food, I think they do very well!  I've had their pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches and salads and they were all very well done.  I do really like the food; however, it's expensive compared to what you're getting.  I'd put it on par with Austin's price-point at around $15 an entrée (more for the better dishes such as steak or seafood).  I'm happy enough paying the price considering it's pretty good, but it might discourage others that are on a budget. The service is spotty.  You'll have one server become your best friend and give you superb quality service, but then you can get a lazy, apathetic server that really only cares about how much you tip them rather than how they can earn your tip.  I would've given BJ's a 4 star review if it weren't for this aspect. Overall, I think this place is nice for date or business lunch.  I personally won't be a regular here when there are a myriad of better beer and food options for my money.  Despite what I think, these guys will be doing very well considering their lucrative location next to Harmony and all those big box retailers such as Lowes and Target.  I'd recommend that anyone should try this place at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=40,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

75,Steven D.,"Hubbard, OH",1,55,15.0,3.0,2013-09-24,"I stopped here last evening for dinner. Had the house root beer, Calamari, and the hand tossed (their version of thin crust) three pepperoni pizza. I had a server named Autumn who did a good job keeping my drink full and helping answer some questions I had about the menu. The food response time from the kitchen was very good. In fact the pizza came out so fast I am not sure how they did it so fast and still cooked it so crispy. The Calamari was alright and the pizza was pretty good except all of the pepperoni made it a little too salty for my taste. All of this was at a pretty decent price since I was there during happy hour and the food items I had were half price. I will probably go back at some point because I noticed some things on the menu that looked interesting. If I were to have the three peperoni pizza again, I would have them hold some of the pepperoni and add mushrooms to make the pizza a little less salty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=60,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

91,Moody F.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,15,,3.0,2013-11-09,"It took me a while to get through their menu to write an honest review. Frankly the menu is so big that I don't believe they'll ever find success in serving good food. I will share the bad and good, in that order.  The bad: - Please avoid anything fried. I ordered the fish tacos.. no these were not tempura or lightly battered as the wait staff suggested, it was so heavily battered that the friend batter was 3 to 1 ratio to actual fish meat. Same with the cheese sticks.. I couldn't even finish eating them.  -The pizza, their specialty.. really disappointing. The appetizer pizza was so greasy, the deep dish was disgusting, and a ""thin crust"" (NOT thin crust) that was on special  was ok and tasty.. but 1 out of 3... not so hot to trot.  -The BBQ special... for months.. dry and not seasoned that well.  -The burgers are ok - not great, not terrible.  -The pasta was dry.  Really... it's hard to mess up pasta and they did. -Seriously it takes over 10 minuets to get a drink. I've gotten in the habit of ordering two at once so I stop being pissed off at the wait time. -Food delivery timing. RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT order dinner until 10 mins before you want it. I guarantee you it will arrive 2 mins after the appetizers get there if you do not heed this rule. This is a pet peeve of mine. The good: (Healthy food!) -I ordered the fish, after above I must have been drunk to think it a good idea. I took my first bite, looked at my husband and said they screwed up and cooked it right!  The fish was PERFECTLY cooked, delicious, and I can say they do it right on a regular basis as I've ordered it a few times.  -The appetizers are good, I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps. They are messy and are the best appetizer we think after trying them all.  -The mixed drinks, even though they take forever are well made. I recommend the wild-berry mojito... holy cow that is super delicious in you're in a sweet mood. -The salads. When i ordered my first salad I was seriously taken back when they plate came with shredded lettuce. I thought it was burger lettuce. But the way the salad was put together it worked in perfect harmony with the other ingredients. I was surprised and corrected about my notion that shredded lettuce didn't belong in (some) salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2?start=80,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

She wasn't very attentive but when she was there, she was friendly. It was a chilly day so I had asked if I could get some Bailey's in coffee...instead she brought me an Irish coffee (which I believe is whiskey in coffee, not a fan). She didn't come back for a LOOONNNGGG time; by the time she returned, we'd finished our food and were ready to go so it was awkward to tell her that it wasn't what I wanted. $6 for a drink I didn't want.

Overpriced, beyond mediocre food and presentation, along with crappy service and long wait times.

My first visit to a BJ's since the La Jolla, CA, location in 2012. A young, inexperienced server left us waiting multiple instances, even though we were one of just 3-4 tables in his area. He also brought us extra, overly-sized dishes which there was absolutely no room for on our small table, dropped them off and walked away.  $25 bill = ""Enlightened Thai Mango Chicken Salad,"" Roasted Vegetable Flatbread Pizza, and a 5oz flute taster of ""BJ's house-brewed PM Porter."" The $13 Thai salad was worth $6-7, included very little of the ingredients advertised (mango, chicken, pepper) and arrived poorly presented - only fluffed up spinach topped with a slimy slab of avo appeared to be in the bowl. Roasted veg flatbread pizza was alright - it's roughly a 4""x12"" thin-crust pizza. The porter sample was enjoyable. A fairly flavorful American Porter, balanced chocolate flavor and very fine head... but I waited way too long for it to arrive. Large dining room, nice decor... the restroom was jazzy, hooray! -But nobody was there to rub my shoulders while I was at the urinal, boo. Also, the entrance is oriented away from the majority of the parking lot, which means if you approach from the way where you THINK the entrance would be, you wind up walking around more than half of the building, which was especially more annoying in inclement weather.

I then decided to go to BJ's with a 3 other couples (8 total) for Dinner and Drinks.  The problems I had on this visit is the reason for the low rating.  We had a reservation for pm, they didnt seat us until 7:45.  The waitress had a HUGE attitude and was NOT failure with the menu and gluten free options.   We ordered drinks which arrived slowly, without the round of waters we asked for as well.  We asked again for water, and guess what didnt come...  Then we ordered dinner at which point we asked again for waters.  I saw a manager roll by shortly after and asked him if we could get some waters and informed him we asked numerous times.  Finally waters showed up. Then the dinner showed up, 1st off we got 7 out of the 8 dinners.... the last one came out 10 minutes after the others.  Also the sides ordered were not what was brought to the table.  Upon asking our waitress to fix the side dishes, she responded with a large attitude and about 15 minutes later she fixed 3 of the 4 sides that were wrong.  The 4th side order we gave up on after asking a few more times. 1/2 way through dinner we were greeted by another waitress who informed us she was taking over the table due to our previous waitress having a bad night.  She was reasonable, though when it came time for the bill she had no clue so she needed to get with the previous waitress to try and figure it out.  Im sure you can all imagine how that turned out.

I've eaten at other locations of this chain and enjoyed their fare.  The prime rib dip caught my eye and proved to be a wise choice. The bread was fresh and au jous was flavorful without falling into the trap of tasting like a melted salt lick. The beef was delicious, tender and ample. The strawberry lemonade wasn't the finest I've ever sampled, but it was a pleasing balance of sweet and sour; quite refreshing. While waiting for my client, I sampled the stuffed mushrooms which were quite tasty. A light drizzle of juice from a lemon slice really made them pop. I am currently awaiting a white chocolate chip and macadamia nut pazookie, my favorite flavor of their signature  dessert. Unless they take a flamethrower to it or serve one left over from last week, I expect it to be a delicious stroll down the decadent, sugar-paved lane to Foodcomaland.  I knocked their rating a bit due to the service. The hostess was very nice and accommodated my seating request. My waiter was also nice, though during my extended wait for a client who pulled a no-show, he seemed to forget that I was still present.

I have a Virginia driver's license because my husband is military and we move every three to four years. There is no sense in me changing it every time so I just kept my home state. In short, the bar tender did not think it was real and said she would have to take it to the manager. Ok, so implying I'm an underage liar is probably not the best way to get me to come back. So 15 minutes later the manager comes out and asks if I have another form of ID because he can't accept my driver's license because it has a WY address on it. I explain to him that we are military and the Virginia DMV allows us to have the address of where we are stationed. That wasn't good enough so I have to walk out to my car, get my military ID which I only have to show to get on base, and then FINALLY they agree that I'm over 21 (PS, I am 26).

15,Mark E.,"Cheyenne, WY",21,10,,4.0,2016-09-03,"We do not normally go out to eat these days for a variety of reasons, but decided to have a treat for our little family. When we were in Costco checking out, we asked the cashier if she could recommend Freddy's. We were immediately accosted by the cashier, two box-uppers, and the people in line behind us informing us that we should go somewhere else unless we had a death-wish. I asked what they recommended and was told to try BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. As a disclaimer, this is not an eating establishment I have ever visited before. Some cons - 1. Walking in the front door, we were not greeted which I notice other people have said the same thing. It looked a lot like an expensive, over-priced yuppie establishment with young, ""I-don't-care-about-you"", treat-me-like-a-god 20 year old college dropouts manning the front desk trying to look like they were the glue that held BJ's together. 2. The young person that greeted us did not say welcome but asked one question when I said we needed a table for four. He asked, ""Are you a premier member?"" I responded no. He did not ask if I was interested in being a premier member. He did not even smile at the peons in front of him and bewail the fact that we had no idea what we were missing at not being a member of the elite who frequented this location. Nope, nope, nope. He simply said, ""OK,"" pointed to a spot on the floor near his desk and said, ""Wait there!"" Turning he walked off into the darkness of the restaurant that really did not look overly inviting. 3. After eventually being seated by afore-mentioned young man, he simply pointed to the table. We sat and he put our menus down and then walked off. He did not say anything about a waitress being with us soon and still no welcome, even though we were one of the masses of the lower class who are not already members of the Premier Members Club. 4. We sat for 15 minutes in a restaurant that was actually not at lunch time and was emptying quite rapidly. I wondered if I had said we were members of the Premier class if we would have had better service. After just over 15 minutes, we finally had a waitress come by and ask, ""Has anybody come to take your order yet?""  We responded in the negative and she said, ""Well, I would be happy to help you today. Would you like to start with some appetizers or something to drink?"" Now for the pros - 1. The waitress was nice, but not sickly sweet like the Freddy's Frozen Custard I got after our lunch, but that is a different review. She was friendly and made it look like she was genuinely enjoying her job. 2. Our iced water with lemon was quickly placed on the table in large, squeaky clean glasses and there were NO FLOATIES in the water. The water in most restaurants deserves a negative review on Yelp just by itself. BJ's must use a filtering system because I actually just about downed my glass in a few minutes and it was actually refreshing. The lemon was freshly cut and the size was enough to squeeze into my water and even the next refill. 3. Our children ordered a pizza to split with different toppings and my wife and I had the sirloin. My wife ordered the roasted asparagus and a bowl of tomato bisque (I think bisque is a French word that means, not from a Heinz soupcan or something like that.)  I ordered the Piranha Pale Ale bowl of chili as one of my sides and the garlic cheddar mashed potatoes (which I can obviously spell unlike former Vice-President Dan Quayle). 4. Our bowls of tomato bisque and piranha pale ale chili arrived in a portion that I thought was almost a main course just by itself. It was large. I could have ordered it in a bread bowl and would have probably been full. There was fresh basil and croutons in the tomato bisque, and mine had a dollop of freshly grated cheddar cheese and a nice helping of sour cream right on top. We both stirred ours up mixing everything together and I could not help but notice that our children were drooling and saying they would have liked what we had instead of pizza. They had not even tried their pizza or our soup. The first taste made me think of the culinary critic writing his critiques in the restaurant on the movie Ratatouille. It was amazing. It had all the right flavors and I am not sure how the Piranha fits into the chili, but I would go back JUST for this chili. Our children finished ours off as we wanted space for the rest of our dinner. 5. Finally as I am running out of space, the children got their pizza and we tasted it and were wowed again. The steak would take another full page for review. It was phenomenal. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak so succulent. I am glad I don't have space to describe it because I would not want you to drool on your keyboard and short it out. Overall, while the first impression was not the best, the rest made up for it. We will visit again and I will probably order the same thing!

I ordered the Hibiscus tea which is okay, I probably wouldn't order it again. For an appetizer, we ordered the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts which were good but I liked them better at Austins.. because at Austin's they have bacon in them! For dinner, my coworkers and I ordered a chicken club, Mediterranean pizza (1/2 off deep dish pizza on Mondays), seared ahi salad, creamy couscous Mac & cheese, and the Mediterranean pita tacos.  Omg the creamy couscous mac n cheese is freaking amaze balls! The added bacon and the baked bread crumbs on top is so good. The Mediterranean pizza is ok, I would've preferred a meat lovers or something but the Mediterranean pita tacos are delicious. They taste really fresh and not really heavy except for the pita bread. The side it comes with is good too. I believe it's like a quinoa mix with corn, beans, and peppers. The seared ahi tuna salad was pretty good too, the tuna was tender and cooked to perfection.  My coworker got the oasis beer and really loved it, he's a beer snob lol so I recommend it.  For dessert, I ordered the mini gluten free chocolate chip pizookie, oh my gosh so good! If I wasn't full I would've ordered a bigger one.  4 stars because I didn't care for the Mediterranean pizza and the hibiscus tea but it's definitely worth a try because everything else is so good. The restaurant is clean and nicely kept. All of the servers are really nice and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

9,Ming X.,"Fort Collins, CO",20,77,60.0,3.0,2017-06-01,We came for lunch.  The artichoke dip was really good.  It was popping hot and tasty.  My bison burger was so so.  The buns were dried up.  Nothing special about the burger.  I had it better elsewhere.  My colleague's pizza however looked pretty good.  Thick crust loaded with toppings.  The Pizookie was good.  Soft cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  Service was decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
10,Dan L.,"Windsor, CO",8,4,,1.0,2017-09-24,"We stopped in last night to have dinner and we waited forever to be seated which is fine I expect that on a Friday night but we finally get seated. We were all hungry and excited. But the slow service and horrible food was a huge letdown. We had someone order soup and when it as brought out no spoon we had to ask and it took forever once again. We also know our kids are cute but when the server is more interested in talking to them and asking them to draw things for her instead of getting sweetener packets that we asked for when she had come by in previous trips it was getting redicoulos. My wife's steak was cooked to the point where a old boot would have been considered medium rare compared to what we were given. My burger was cold and the kids macaroni and cheese was cold and solidified. When my wife confessed that the steak was to well done the server said she will have them make another so we sat there another hour waiting for that. Then the bill came and we were charged for everything. Which was a disappointment. Bad food, bad service, ruined our other plans because we were there almost 3 hours. We have been here before and it was not like this. I don't know what was going on that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

0,Jeff S.,"Fort Collins, CO",79,35,8.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Giving it three stars because we have eaten here many, many times since it opened. If it were our first experience, it's a one or a two tonight. Ordinarily, the service is pretty good and the staff is courteous. On this occasion, not so much. And it's pretty disappointing. We sat at the bar so we could watch Thursday Night Football. The place was packed. The bartender came over and got our beer order after about 10 minutes. Wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich, I ordered a burger, fries and calamari as an appetizer. The food took longer than normal, I'm assuming because the place was pretty busy. Wife's meal arrived as ordered. But my burger was served without fries and the calamari wasn't served prior to the main dishes. So I asked about both. Who orders a burger without fries? And what about the calamari? Not cool. They brought out fries and calamari about 5-10 minutes later. Bizarre. And then a gal, who I assume is kitchen manager, comes out to apologize. I'm a bit agitated, so I ask her, ""who orders a burger without fries? And why wasn't the calamari served as an appetizer?"" To which she says in a short tone, ""Sir, I am taking care of the calamari. Sorry."" Great, but the tone and demeanor were shitty. As if I were wrong to question it. Newsflash - when I take my wife out for dinner, and I'm obviously paying for someone to prepare and serve our meal, the expectation is the food be served as ordered in a timely fashion. Otherwise, I'll cook my own damn food and eat at home. When that expectation isn't met, I blame the server and tip accordingly if at all. In this case, I left $4 on a $27 tab. To make it worse, wife left her phone at the bar. When she returned to get it, she had to wait around for more than 10 minutes while the same bartender and kitchen manager gave her the cold shoulder and short attitude before finally giving her the phone. We live close by and have gone in often because it's convenient and the service historically has been good. Not sure when or if we'll go back after tonight's experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.4,2.95,2.95,,3.13
4,Molly E.,"Denver, CO",0,7,,2.0,2017-12-13,This was my third time visiting BJs.  The staff at BJs have always been very nice and courteous.  The reason for my 2 star rating was our food was awful!  Everything tasted like a frozen TV dinner.  It's sad that these big chain restaurants don't care about the food they serve anymore.  I had the pasta and meatballs and it was very disappointing.  Sorry BJs but I won't be returning anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.36,2.92,2.92,,3.096
1,Paul W.,"Wellington, CO",0,4,30.0,1.0,2017-12-20,"When you go to a restaurant (your steak is $21.00) and they ask you how would you like your meal brought out  (Appetizer 1st wait for me to finish my appetizer then, Salad 2nd wait for me to finish my salad and then you should bring my steak) and they agree well that's how your meal should be brought out. Just started eating my salad and here comes my steak. Now, if I want to eat a cold steak, mash potatoes and asparagus I would be totally done with how you delivered my food but, I'm not. Told the waiter... Take it back he said what, take it back. This was from last time, still over cooked prime rib, forgotten side, and charged for extra drink, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-collins-2,3.32,2.92,2.92,,3.08
