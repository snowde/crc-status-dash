114,Michael S.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,31,4.0,4.0,2014-11-29,"Nothing to complain about, great service, awesome food, (I had the Flatbread appetizer & Parmesan Chicken with greenbeans.) Also many of the house brews.  This is a newer, different size BJ's restuaunt. They do not have the big screen TV,  just 3 large LED TV's behind the bar and several others around the restuaunt. My only complaint, that is easily rectified, no cell service for Verizon in the bar, only outside. Get an amplifier or cell repeater in the bar.  I was trying to meet up with & have others come to this new bar, and I was unable to connect with them until I left the restaurant. My visits here will be limited till that changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-myers?start=60,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001
84,Tara A.,"Ogunquit, ME",50,42,14.0,3.0,2014-11-30,"Beautiful interior. TV screens everywhere. 40+ beers on tap. Lots to love. Great selection of food. However, the food really lacked flavor. Fish tacos were very bland and lacked any spice or kick. My sister orders scallops and said hers was not impressive either. Bland rice and very few scallops. Nachos were very disappointing because they are made with Fritos... It may have been my own fault for assuming they would be made with tortilla chips. Service was very very slow every thought it seems like waitresses only have 3 tables each and there are sooo many employees. I would go back here for the beer selection and to watch a game on TV. I would compare this place to Applebee's because of its laid back bar atmosphere, cheap well rounded menu, and good half price apps during happy hrs. Really just mediocre food though. Also the floor is extremely slippery!!

70,Cara C.,"Fort Myers, FL",6,1,,5.0,2014-12-22,"I signed up for yelp just to write this review because our experience was THAT GREAT!  We tried this restaurant for the first time right after they opened.  Our server was clearly new however she was very helpful and a server trainer was by her side.  We ordered the calamari and the avacado egg rolls.  Both appetizers were fresh, hot, and delicious!  My boyfriend got the Greek tacos, and I got a salad suggested by the server.  All the food was fantastic and the service from host to busser was polite and pleasant.  They even have an app that makes it easy to order ahead and pay right from your phone So...we went back and were not disappointed. We had Jason this time and he was friendly,  knowledgeable and there when we needed him...and here's where they really impressed us: we forgot two pairs of expensive sunglasses on the table!  Oops! And didn't realize it until the following day! So we went in and they had my shades but not my boyfriend's ray bans! So they told us they would call us if they found them.  Sure enough they did! They had fallen behind the lost and found box but, they were found! We were so grateful for the honesty.  The management is top notch! They gave us their word and followed though!  I think we have a new favorite place to take the family!

Unfortunately, we were ignored and not acknowledged for at least 15 minutes at the table. After getting up and mentioning this to the hostess that sat us, it took another 10 minutes for a server to arrive. Mind you, others that arrived after us were waited on immediately. I finally ordered a beer with the server that took another 15 minutes to get. Our order for food at this point wasn't even taken yet. No one ever apologized for the lengthy wait.

First we ordered and appetizer and never got it, our waitresses excuse was we are still working out our issues in the kitchen. I have a garlic allergy and I made that very clear before ordering and when I got my food my sandwich had garlic butter on the bread. When I told the server she said the kitchen told her nothing on my plate had garlic on it. I clearly tasted garlic. Had I not noticed thing could have been a lot more serious.  My mom's burger was burnt to a crisp instead of medium like she ordered. The staff was full of nothing but excuses.

67,Kevin B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,28,2.0,3.0,2015-01-25,"This establishment is relatively new in the area so we decided to try it out for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon.  We ordered iced teas, bacon cheeseburger and a pulled pork sandwich. Starting score of 5 stars became 4 immediately when drinks were served with unwrapped straws and the waitress was asked if they had wrapped straws and she looked and came back and said they didn't. No matter how clean you are, bartenders and servers touch dirty glasses, dishes, and utensils, they touch money, they touch pens that others have touched to sign their checks etc.  they shouldn't be touching a straw someone puts in their mouth.  Nuff said, let me stop preaching.  The waitress was understanding and looked for another option for me and we came up with bottled water so I was not without drink.  I appreciated her effort because she initially came back and said they had no bottled water but then she found a Perrier. Her service was excellent, quite attentive and caring.  The burger was actually quite well cooked and juicy and very tasty as were the shoestring fries. Kind of typical bar fare but very tasty. My friend liked his pulled pork sandwich but did comment the cole slaw was extremely dry and not that appetizing. A little extra mayo would go far.  4 went to 3 stars because the bathroom was in need of attention.. Overall we will probably return, it did have a nice family friendly atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon.  There were a lot of families present. I will have to remember to hit up my stash of wrapped straws before visiting and bring one with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-myers?start=120,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

We called ahead to be put on the wait list and FYI this list doesn't actually start until we got there (why didn't anyone tell is that over the phone????) so then we had to wait another 30 min for a table that's would fit a grout of five. After placing the other for avocado egg rolls (MUST try!) we then had to wait another 15 min to get it. I ordered Hawaiian mahi mahi as my entree. The fish was overdone and so it was dry inside and wayyy to hard to stick a fork it! Blahhh... But the Hawaiian rice with pineapple was absolutely amazing.

69,Dippy D.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,,1.0,2015-03-21,"Being a seasonal resident, I visited BJs in Fort Myers for my first time as It was something new to the area that I had never been too before and was pretty excited to try some local crafts. It is very aesthetically pleasing when we walked in and has a menu to match. Alot of pizza but managed to find some nice salmon and salads. The hostess was cute but didn't seem like the most organized bunch. I hate to be the one complaining about service but upon being seated we must have waited at least 10 minutes to place out first round. We almost went to the bar but the menu kept us distracted.  Why it may have taken a while to be greeted for drinks it ended up taking even longer to receive them. We noticed that the older short haired blonde bartender didn't seem like he had much concern or priority for rest of the restaurants drinks (we sat at the bar table and had a front row view). The menu looked fantastic and we were excited to order, but it was definitely upsetting the time from sit down to ordering food was much longer then expected. We only had two round of drinks and we were excited to try more but our server hadn't given us much of an opportunity, being a ""brewhouse"" I was slightly disappointed.Upon delivery of the food we were salivating because the food playing was very tasty, how it looked, etc. But, our plates were extremely hot and the food was some what luke warm(typically a sign of being left In the window) but I usually like my food room temperature so I was fine with it, my partner not as much. We enjoyed most of the rest of the food but didn't feel wanted for dessert. The restaurant started filling up and we sat with empty plates and glasses for quite some time after our meal and just didn't feel welcome, even for a finishing round of drinks. We mentioned our food and experience as we left to management. We liked the idea of the place and food but just thought maybe they were short staffed or the such but management showed little concern if any. Claiming the restaurant is a ""laid back atmosphere"". Overall the food and kitchen look and taste great. But the lack of service even lead to the food quality diminishing when it was cold. Makes me upset to think my fresh food ""died"" in the window waiting to be delivered. I'd rate the food and beer a lot higher but the service lacked luster. I would have rated higher stars but with the lack of concern from the management perspective I couldn't see myself frequenting Bjs.

116,Emily L.,"Naples, FL",16,14,9.0,4.0,2015-03-27,"Enjoyed a date night here a week ago, on a busy bustling Saturday night. Showed up at 7 with no reservation, waited about 15-20 mins for a table, which wasn't bad for a FULL restaurant. (Btw this was my first ever visit to a BJs, my date has been before and recommended it).  They sat us in a small section of 3 2-person booths. It was perfect, we had a view of the whole place without being smack dab in the middle of families and chaos.  Our server was the best part about this place. Her name was Beatrice but she asked us to please call her B, right off the bat being personable and friendly! I think she got the drift we were on a first date bc she gave us ample time to chat, browse the menu, and enjoy our cocktails...so appreciated.

Dinner was okay, the only shining star was the sriracha Brussels sprouts,a new menu starter item. They were delicious! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked great. Everyone I was with got a pizza and it looked delicious -- they also said as much. Why such a low rating you might ask? Service was slow, I know it was a Saturday night but by the time we got our dinner it was close to 9:15 and quite a few open tables.

How can you manage a problem if you're not aware of it.  - Ordered dessert and the check was plopped on the table immediately.  The check was paid and I had my credit card back 6 minutes before the desert even came to the table.

I tried both and neither altered the fact that something was off with the beef. I ate all of the fries to ward off starvation. When our server finally returned and noticed I had eaten almost none of the sandwich, she asked how our food was. I told her I did not care for the sandwich which had an off taste. She said something which I couldn't understand and left the table.  She reappeared later with no mention of the former discussion and presented the check.  I understand not everyone likes every dish they order, but...to completely ignore a guest's displeasure is no way to keep a patron's business.

Next, the silverware was dirty. I unrolled my napkin to find pieces of dried food on both the fork and knife. I prompted my friends to check their silverware. Another knife and fork had dried food, also. Obviously, whoever rolled the silverware wasn't paying attention. Lastly, we all requested well done/crispy fries.  None of us received them that way. When brought to the server's attention, all she did was acknowledge that they weren't crispy. She did tell us that she did, indeed, key them all in the system that way. Ok. There was no offer to replace them or even an attempt to bring out a new plate. Fries are an easy fix and cost close to nothing. This problem should've been resolved easily.

The bacon was alright, but I ended up removing the half of it from my sandwich. The picture in the menu shows a whole piece of chicken. What I ended up getting was diced chicken breast. The sandwich was described as ""grilled sourdough bread""; the bread was probably buttered on both side and grilled a la grilled cheese style so it ended up being too greasy.

A group of us, complete with wee-ones, decided to give them a try for dinner.  We were lucky to draw and experienced waiter, who was friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. He kept making regular sweeps to keep drinks topped off and to see if we needed anything. Only once did he have to be reminded about a drink order from the bar. Not bad! He also made some really good menu suggestions based on his personal experience.  I tried the chicken parm, which turned out to be a generous enough portion to make for a good lunch the next day. The dish was quite delicious and cooked perfectly.  All things considered, this visit met or exceeded expectations. Enough so, that I visited on a second occasion.  The next visit was for a late lunch, and we ordered a pizza - Chicago style deep dish. It was good, but very doughy, but that's to be expected with this style. It was quite good, even the leftovers the next day.  The wait staff on this trip was less than enthusiastic. Absent for most of the meal, we were taken care of upon request, but this waitress could have used a bit more OTJ experience. Quite alright... she'll get there! I still chalk it up as a good visit.
