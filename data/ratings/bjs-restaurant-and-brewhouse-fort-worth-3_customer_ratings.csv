108,Andi F.,"San Diego, CA",10,8,7.0,4.0,2012-03-10,"It's been years since we have been to Bj's. Went to Bj's on a whim; since it was so close to home. Friday night and we thought we'd end up waiting forever. Got there around 6:00 and got sat about 15 minutes later ; pretty awesome considering the place looked completely full. The waiter, was very nice. His name is Matthew. Despite how packed the restaraunt was he was very helpful. His demeanor was relaxed; despite the crowd. I always have problems picking from the menu ( I get overwhelmed by the choices and I only want to make an awesome choice - that I leave happy making ). Sometimes waiters seem to get frustrated by my asking ""what would you pick? (this or this?)"" . He was so helpful! I was a very happy person with the pick that Matthew helped me with.  Avocado Rolls (appetizer) served with a kind of sweet sauce. It is what it's name suggests. These roles were packed with slices of avocado! and I love avocado. Right up my alley. He was very attentative. My drink was always full. I ordered the Chicken A La Fresca ( it was on the ""light meal"" ( something like that ) section on the menu. Normally I never go for boneless skinless chicken breast; the thought makes my mouth dry up. For some reason it was between that and the chili fork and knife sandwitch. MMMmmmm If you are a person who avoids this part of the chicken as much as me you'll be so happy you tried this one. It was paired with a ratatouille style zuccini and yellow squash (to be honest I picked it because it made me think of the movie ""Ratatouille"" - i'm such a dork) and rice, all topped with arugala. I ate half and saved the other half so I could enjoy more of it tomorrow :)   My husband had a pepperoni and pineapple calzone. He is a big time pizza person and he ""liked it"" only thing he said he wished the meat and pineapple was spread out better (all his pepperoni was stuffed on one side and he thought they forgot to include it. I personally loved the texture and taste of the bread on this. To end it off, Matthew brought out the Bj's Baked Beignet (ben-ya) made from the bread they use for the pizza. Was going to get the Ptzookie ""something like that"" but I would definately recommend this. Topped with fresh cut strawberies a scoup of vanilla bean ice cream and wip cream mixed with the warmth slight crisp and soft insides of the Beignet... it was the perfect dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3?start=100,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

The service was prompt and friendly.  Their menu ranges from pizza and burgers to fish, salads and steaks with a wide range of various appetizers.

She looked right at our table with empty tea and never bothered to refill them. We finally had to ask her to do so.

There is literally nothing there that i've tried and haven't loved. They make some of the best pizza around, their chicken parm is amazing and their fresh baked pizookies (cookies backed in a pan like pizza) are to die for. On top of that, they brew their own beer and they pair will with the food! They have a very extensive menu which ranges from pan seared ahi tuna to italian fare to down home American comfort foods. I challenge you to go there and NOT be able to find something that floats your boat. This location in particular is great. Its staff is great and I've always been taken care of when I went there.

59,Lauren N.,"Fort Worth, TX",421,1308,3098.0,2.0,2012-12-04,I really wanted to love this place. I went here for lunch today with 2 of my coworkers. We waited over 10 minutes at the front host stand for someone to come seat us. There were a few other people who came in behind us who waited too. Maybe the host was in a break? Someone should have been watching the door... Once we were seated our server explained the menu well and we ordered drinks and a appetizer to share. She dropped off our drinks and then we didn't see her again till we had someone find her. Our appetizer was dropped off by someone else. I had to flag someone down for small plates to eat our appetizer. Someone different brought our main meals- we had to flag someone to bring ketchup. Once we finished eating we had to flag someone else to get our checks. Very poor service. Unorganized and I don't feel like I should search for service! The food was tasty- grabbing lunch should be a quick thing- maybe 45 minutes tops. We didn't leave until 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. I may try them again and sit in the bar where I won't have to flag anyone. Maybe.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3?start=60,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

I had to ask for water 3 times. Everything was a ""it will be out in just a minute"". When we finally received our food, I received my order well after everyone else received theirs. When I finally got my order it was only half of it. My turkey was ice cold. As in it was just thawed out and thrown on there and still had ice on it. I ate it anyway as I was starving and definitely did not want to ask for something different. My friends chicken marsala has very little sauce and he didn't like it either. Another friend had a burger that was completely charred on the outside and practically raw on the inside. The fastest thing the waiter did was bring my change out. Once again it was horrible service.

55,Mark B.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,28,7.0,1.0,2013-03-24,"Our first trip to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was on a Saturday evening so we knew it would be busy.   The whole evening was a series of ups and downs that ultimately made me wish I had chosen a different location. The first signals that it might not be a good evening started when the hostess said it was a 15 minute wait that turned into a 30 minute wait.  While we were waiting several other folks ahead of us handed in their pagers and left. Once we were seated, our waiter appeared promptly took our drink and appetizer orders.  Both of which showed up fast!  The calamari and cheese sticks were both tasty.  But we had no silverware and the plates he gave us were dirty.   Ugh.   So after eating with fingers, no plates, and no napkins for 10 minutes  I managed to flag down a different waiter and resolve these issues. Oh one more thing, my beer was warm...another sign things were not on the right track.  After 15 minutes our original waiter reappears to take our food order.  And then disappears without refilling the water glasses or even asking about a second ale for me.  Another 30 minutes go by with no sign of our waiter; so I finally catch the manager and ask him for help with our food.    5 minutes later our entrees arrive; the wife's salad is ok, the daughter's chicken strips arrive but without fries, and my burger is cooked to a cinder but is tepid and cold.  I try to make the best of it but I couldn't eat more than a 1/3 of the burger.  By then the waiter reappears with my daughters ""smiley"" fries; not bad for french fried mashed potato faces but late again none the less. I send my burger back and we all decide to wrap up the meal.  Dessert would have probably taken another hour at the rate things were going.... The manager ended up comping my burger but nothing else for our delay, bad service and overall bad experience.  If all you want is a light snack of appetizers and drinks, this might be your kind of joint; but, for a full service meal, this place stinks.  So I'm unlikely to return till I see a big sign that reads ""under new management"".   I hope someone has a better experience at this joint than I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3?start=60,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006

107,Sarah L.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,5,4.0,2.0,2013-06-07,"I want to start by saying that I really love BJ's the food is great and generally the atmosphere is really good too. I work close to this location so I have been in twice with co-workers. Since they are right in front of the mall, they are ALWAYS busy and the parking is horrible. Since I go during my lunch hour we sat at the bar both times thinking it would be faster and we could avoid the waiting list. This is a mistake. We've had the same waitress both times and she is very friendly and likeable; however, since she is basically trying to cover the whole bar area, which is quite large, she wasn't able to pay much attention to us. Additionally we had to ask her several times for items we needed - I am willing to be forgiving on this matter though because the poor girl was really trying, she just had too much. It's been the same way both times we've been in. I really felt bad for her. Since she was so busy there were a couple of ""food runners"" who basically handed us our food and walked away without a word. There were 3 of us plus we ordered a few things to go for other co-workers. We arrived at about 11:45 hoping to beat the lunch rush and didn't leave until after 1. We spent a lot of time waiting for food and service, and mind you, we placed our orders as soon as we got there because we already knew what we wanted. It took us over 30 minutes to get our food and another 30 minutes to get our to go orders - we placed the to go orders at the same time we placed our dine in orders.

Rice pilaf tasted like old rice a roni. My wife had chicken fried steak, again the batter tasted like they hadn't changed out the grease in a while. The white cheddar mashed potatoes however were amazing. I wish I had more. So creamy and flavorful. For dessert we had a salted Carmel pizookie? A warm delicious Carmel cookie with white chocolate and pretzel pieces. Carmel sauce on top. It was so rich 2 bites were enough, but it was quite yummy.

27,Mindy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",155,344,68.0,3.0,2015-09-10,"BJ's normally has QUICK SERVICE. I've found that you can order something very last minute and if you go to pick it up, it'll be ready when you get there. Even if you're calling in the order from the car whilst already driving. But I'm unsure whether or not this location offers curbside pick up. AVOCADO EGG ROLLS, you'll WANT THEM. For those who don't know, egg rolls are not any type of traditional food. They were invented in America/for Americans. So to say they are good for something ""Americanized"" isn't completely correct, but you get where I'm going with it. They have a great amount of avocado in them. They come fried and with a sweet dipping sauce. The sweet dipping sauce is very good but you can tell how terrible it is for you. Not that the rest of it is much healthier either haha. They are categorized as a shareable appetizer, but for someone with a small appetite, it can definitely be a meal.  They have a decent lunch specials menu, beginning at $5.75. They have an unlimited salad and soup option, which is always good for variety. I don't particularly like their caprese salad but I can be a cheese snob. It's another option next to traditional salad options; cesar or house. They have a strong tomato bisque soup and their broccoli cheddar is VERY GOOD. They also have a one topping personal pizza option, which kind of sucks. It's ~$7.75 and then 50 cents extra per topping. For an already small option, it's not priced accordingly in my opinion. Their pizzas are VERY GREASY THOUGH and could use more pizza sauce. I normally DON'T ORDER THEIR PIZZAS. But I think their known for them? I've had some of their other entrees and their salads, so you can't really go wrong here as a quick, good lunch option. Dessert here is SO GOOD. Pazookis (is that how you spell it) which you get one for free on your bday. Is a type of cookie and a type of ice cream scooped on top. The cookie is warm so it melts the ice cream a bit. It's just the right PERFECTNESS you want and expect from BJ's. It's their twist on the traditional molten cakes a lot of ""American"" restaurants offer.  My normal chain restaurant disclaimer: I like to comment more about the service, cleanliness, and the process experience when it comes chain restaurants because these are the main factors that vary between them. They all have the same menu. Although I go into more details regarding the menu here because despite this being a large chain, I have known many people who haven't had it before.This particular location IS NOT BUSY DURING LUNCH.

However I am getting really tired of the attitude on their rewards program. Tonight (Saturday) we arrived just after 6, and the restaurant surprisingly had only about 30% of the tables filled.  After asking for seating for two, the hostess, as usual, asked if we were members of their loyalty program. After responding no, she answered,""that's okay; we can seat you anyway."" We walked past many empty tables and booths and were seated at the very back table by the kitchen entrances. If this is their type of hospitality, why would I want to be loyal to them?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.408,2.8

To move on, we usually don't eat deep dish pizza, but I had a craving since visiting Chicago earlier this year.  If I was to rate the pepperoni extreme, it would get two stars.  The reason is because It needed sauce, which was absent.  However, it was the perfect pizza for my wife which is the opposite of my opinion...go figure?

I had a simple turkey burger and salad greens with vinaigrette. The salad wasn't like I ordered. I asked if it could be fixed. Waiter returned with a completely difft type of salad with ranch dressing and additional toppings. I turned it down and asked could I just have the salad I ordered. His response was this is the salad and I just added ranch on the vinaigrette and croutons and carrots. He became upset when I said I didn't want it, I wanted what I ordered. Walked away and slammed the plate on the table behind us. The waiter working with the opposite end of our party had their tickets ready and returned with receipts in minutes.

Our server had messy hair stringing down (is that sanitary?) and did her best to speed so quickly by our table without making any type of eye contact so that she would not have to help us out. After we finished our food, server was again too busy to give us the check, so we waited a good 20 minutes for the check. Of course the appetizer has been charged, and we have to wait for her to walk by to let her know. For some reason though, it doesn't really seem like it's a simple mistake, because she's already fully aware that she did not take off the charge for the appetizer. As soon as we call her over, she says ""Oh yes, the appetizer."" I swear BJs makes the servers do this, hoping that the customer will not notice and they can make the extra $, or the servers are just too lazy. This has happened more than on one occasion. Anyways, had to wait another 15 minutes for her to ask her manager to fix the ticket. Please do not treat other people's time like it is worth nothing.

We went during lunch and we were a 6 top which understandably we expected service not to be super quick but at least decent since the place was not packed. With that being said I don't know if this location is understaffed in general or if the service really just is horrendous as we experienced today. I will say the server was diligent on getting our drink order, however exhibited an annoyed attitude throughout our visit. The first round of drinks came out rather quickly and so did the soups and salads. For the most part they were fresh and good. We had to ask for refills - which appeared to irritate the server. When the actual entrees came out they looked thrown together (literally) and were lukewarm to cold. One of our guests order was wrong and when the server was informed of such she audibly sighed and rolled her eyes. The manager came by to ""check on us"" (if that's what you want to call it) and we had to ask him for drink refills because the server never came back around. By the time the one guest's meal was brought back out the rest of us were done with our meals, we all had empty plates and drinks and again no refills were offered. Again we had to ask for them. Although someone was already removing the empty plates and such from our table, we had to flag down the server again to get our bills, and many of us had our payment already ready but instead to taking them the server dropped off the bills and hurriedly walked away although one of our guests kept saying ""ma'am?""

13,De M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,58,8.0,1.0,2017-06-10,"Celebrating my sister's birthday after spa day. Let me start with the cleanliness or lack thereof. There was a little girl with her dad seated near us. She said, "" daddy, this floor is slippery."" His reply was, "" it's because they haven't cleaned it."" That says it all. Our coffee cups were dirty; hadn't been washed. Our table was sticky. My menu had food stains. My shoes were stuck to the floor. My sister asked if they would sweep. I felt gross. The service was grindingly slow and the food was mediocre at best. Our waiter Jared and the manager were responsive to our concerns. The rest of the wait staff looked uninterested. One wonders how long this business will remain, as it is a Saturday, at the mall, in the afternoon, with so few customers. Needless to say, because of the cleanliness factor, I will not return...am afraid to return.

25,Robert F.,"Dallas, GA",0,18,,1.0,2017-06-23,"I've been waiting for the check for quite a while so I figured why not write a quick review while the experience was still fresh on my mind.  The food was actually decent but it did take a couple of attempts to get the order correct because of what our server classified as a ""kitchen disaster"".  Refills were virtually non existent while we waited.  We didn't complain about any of this but the service was bad enough that I overheard the manager chastising the servers.  They clearly didn't care because we never did get anything else to drink.  I thought we were just having bad luck but I have noticed people complaining at the neighboring tables.  Needless to say if I ever get my card back from paying the bill I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3?start=20,2.6,2.9,2.9,,2.7800000000000002
6,Angela T.,"Granbury, TX",0,18,20.0,2.0,2017-07-07,"Good food, but terrible service. Our experience at BJ's starting at 6:30 on a Friday night was nothing short of chaotic. While we were seated quickly, and our server took our order in a timely manner, it all took a deep dive from there on out.  The first bit of drama was over my beverage order. Per their menu I ordered San Pellegrino mineral water, but apparently no one realized they carried it or knew what the heck it was. The first drink they brought out they said was Club soda. I'm pretty sure it was Sprite. When I flagged down a hostess she went and spoke to someone who came and told me that they don't carry mineral water. I pointed out it was a menu item, but was again told they didn't carry any such thing. I asked for a regular water instead, which was brought to me and again I was told they don't carry mineral water by the person who brought it out. Well apparently the manger got wind of the discussion, came over and asked if I wanted a San Pellegrino, and I said yes. He took my glass of tap water away (without asking) and brought me a bottle of San P.  Second came the food problem. I ordered a Brisket Burger without cheese. I always emphasize no cheese because I am allergic. When our food arrived my burger had cheese mixed into the brisket almost hidden by the BBQ sauce. Luckily I spotted it and sent it back. As I said before, the food was good after the order was fixed, but that cheese mistake could have had some serious health consequences.  Third, when it came time to pay our bill, the server scanned our bill onto someone else's credit card even though she had my card in her hand. It took them so long to figure it out that my husband and I left our seats and went to the cash register to find out what the heck was going on. Supposedly they got it all straightened out but it took an additional 15-20 min from when we finished eating to when we finally got out of the restaurant. Needless to say I checked with our credit card company when we got home just to be sure.  Finally, when we were there they had a police officer in uniform stationed out front at the bar/hostess station the whole time. Given that BJ's is an upscale version of Chili's and not the corner pub, his presence was a bit disconcerting. We couldn't help wondering what happened to warrant him or what they were preparing for. Needless to say this and the beverage/food/bill debacle made for a less than relaxing Friday night dinner. It will be awhile before we return to BJ's, and even then it won't be on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3,2.64,2.88,2.88,,2.7840000000000003
7,Abigail O.,"Fort Worth, TX",67,1,4.0,1.0,2017-07-12,"So disappointed, I called in a Togo order and received a soggy salad, with bearly any lettuce and only half the amount of soup I usually get. Also asked the Takout girl over the phone to butter the inside of my bread bowl, she forgot and I had to wait another 10 minutes to get that fixed. Didn't notice my soggy salad or BEARLY THERE SOUP till I got home and when I called in my complaint, the mgrs response was ""if you come back and bring your order in we will go ahead and swap it out for you.""  How is that the solution? What makes him think I want to drive all the way back to fix something that was supposed to be RIGHT the first time? Extremely poor service!

I had to re-order a beer half way throught the one I would be drinking just to get it on time. She paid more attention to my friend,which is a guy than she did me. I dont appreciate that. Little did she know I was paying the bill. Food was good. We had nachos and friend had a steak. I was really just surprised at the fact that they carried Martin House's Salty Lady on tap. I will return just for that. There was a gentleman,maybe the manager,who knew about the beer. Wish I had gotten his name. But he helped me more than my own waitess.

16,Vanessa C.,"Flagstaff, AZ",12,10,1.0,1.0,2017-08-07,"Went here for our anniversary dinner (because I love their pizza) and was so disappointed. We ordered the BJs fav pizza with no mushroom and a wedge salad. I got the salad first and started to eat it and noticed a weird taste and when I looked closer they had replaced the tomatoes with salsa with cilantro since they were out. Then came our pizza and my husband noticed it had mushrooms and told our waitress and she just looked annoyed and took it back. At this point we had been waiting an hour so once we got the second pizza we had been waiting an hour and a half and not once did she apologize or check on us, but the worst part she charged us for the salad that I clearly could not eat. I really think it was the poor service that made it such a horrible experience, we can totally look past the mix up with the mushrooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3,2.6,2.81,2.81,,2.726

The only reason why I am rating this as less than 5 stars is the food selection.  While I love BJ's;  my husband is disappointed with the quality of the food.  But that's more of a corporate issue.  I wouldn't say it's poor quality or bad;  his opinion is that it's just not something to write home about.

1,Scott A.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,61,121.0,2.0,2017-10-31,"This place is average on their best day. Another experience where it feels like no one with any intention on serving or being helpful is employed. The beer was flat on one of their brews, which made me want to leave. We were visiting during their happy hour and they didn't have much traffic at all, what does that tell you? We stayed because they offer a salad that we enjoy there. I just get disappointed with slow, unresponsive servers. The hostess had a helpful attitude and that got us feeling like we would have a good experience here. As far as the food goes, it took such a long time to get anything out on this occasion. We asked twice and never really felt good about the staff's response. I've been the location close to North East Mall and things were much better there.  I will likely try that location again, I've been tempted to give that location another chance.

15,Elizabeth A.,"Hebron, KY",0,43,5.0,5.0,2017-11-19,This place is great. I sat at the bar with my husband recently and the service and food were way above average. The bartender (I believe his name was Chase?) was so attentive even though there were a lot of others seated at the bar. He filled our waters and paid attention to our drink levels. He had knowledge of the beers on tap and was very helpful. I ordered a salmon dinner and my husband ordered a couple of the appetizer specials and it was all too hot to eat when it came out.

5,Inez P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,1.0,2018-01-09,Really disappointed in the food and staff. They deliver our plate and walk off. Didn't say anything didn't wait to see us cut into our steak. We cut into them and they were well done. We ordered medium rare. So we looked around and nothing no waitress. Waited. Started to eat our sides because we were hungry and about half way through the sides I found someone attention who was sweeping and she said she would look for our waiter after we told her about our steaks. After a while the manager I assume came up he had not informed he was but the difference between shirts has me assume that he was. Asked with his hands up like what!?! I explained that our steaks were over cooked. He asked if we wanted new steaks? My initial reaction was to look and laugh like well what do you think!? I been waiting at least 15 minutes or more of course I do. We are hungry. So he asked or would we like to try something else. I said no. The correct steak. Waiting again with no waiter to return until 7 minutes later I asked for our check and then they asked if I want it boxed. I said no I won't reheat a steak to be back to a well done steak in the end again. So $44-$45 later I ate mashed potatoes and dry broccoli with little cheese as orders and no steak. I was so upset and explain to the waiter I am upset that no one checked on us to see how are steaks were and we had waited so long until they finally showed up 20 minutes after they had delivered them.  He apologized but still out $45 and un fed is a very disappointing way to end the night after a long hard work day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth-3,2.52,2.84,2.84,,2.712
