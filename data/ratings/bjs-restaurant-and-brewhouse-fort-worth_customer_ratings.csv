They forgot the glaze. Potatoes tasted old and moldy, beans not seasoned at all. I spent over $70.00 to take family to dinner.  A great disappointment on this dinner.

149,Diane T.,"Denver, CO",44,583,3.0,2.0,2012-03-19,"I had lunch here with a friend a few weeks ago.  I'm not big on chain restaurants and tend to go for different types of ethnic foods instead when I go out for lunch, but since not everyone likes what I like I'll do 'the chains' on occasion. I'd never been in a BJ's before and I was impressed by the upscale look and feel.  The menu had lots of options - the 'something for everyone' type of menu - so I can see how this place would be a good choice for groups (or in my case, going to lunch with someone who doesn't generally frequent the mom&pop ethnic places). I ordered a salad that sounded good.  I wish their online menu included the name of the dish, but it only shows the description: ""A colorful blend of crisp romaine lettuce, red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with our Santa Fe dressing. Topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, sliced avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast"".  Maybe it was a Sante Fe salad, or something like that.  Regardless, I was disappointed.  For $12 I was expecting something a bit more substantial.  To begin with, my chicken wasn't blackened but just grilled.  It tasted fine, but blackened was what I was expecting and what would have made the dish better (I would have sent it back if I hadn't been there with someone).  Also, the amount of salad greens was somewhat skimpy which made for a rather small salad overall since all of the other ingredients seem to have been added in proportion to the amount of greens.  Anyway, I was not impressed with the salad.  On a positive note, the iced tea was good. I wasn't impressed with our server either.  I don't think she could have acted any more bored if she had tried.  I tip well when I get good service (and not necessarily just based on the price of the meal); she got the bare minimum. Despite all that, I had a nice visit with my friend.  Next time, I'll suggest some place else, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth?start=140,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

Have gone several times, each time hoping that the previous experience was just a bad night or something, but every time leave feeling very disappointed and upset for spending the money. I took my son here one afternoon while he was home from school at about 1:30 pm, after the lunch rush, there were about 7 other tables in the restaurant occupied. I ordered a simple appetizer salad, he a kids meal with corn dog minis and fries. We could never find our waitress, and it took over 30 minutes for the meal to be delivered. At most of our meal without drinks as refills never came. The food here is over prices for the quality!  Restaurant needs serious help on training and educating the staff on the menu and how to treat customers. I can understand a bit of a wait during a rush, but there were about 10 waiters and waitresses that I could see, however, we experienced the issues mentioned above.  Seriously, there are so many other places in the area to try if you want a nice casual meal out. Forget this place all together.

BJ's has become a close, and dear friend over this past year. We've become tight, and I truly do love their micro brews, and the food is above average bar fare, accompanied with an above average price. Now, where the prices are kinda' high, the great service makes up for this. I mean, who really cares about the food, because we come here primarily for the beer. Did I mention that I love beer?

We were seated promptly, which was the only part of the service that was timely. When we arrived, we assumed that we could be in and out in an hour. That hope was dashed as soon as our waiter promised our food was ""on its way"" 20 minutes after ordering. He had already pretty well abandoned our table at this point, so we knew we were screwed.  When the food finally did arrive 10 minutes later, it was tasty, no doubt. However, that far from made up for our service.  We asked for the check as our food was being dropped off, and the waiter offered to comp a part of our bill to make up for our wait. Another 10 minutes or so elapsed, and we reminded him about our check.  ""I thought I gave it to you already.""  So much for taking care of us with some token gesture of apology- we were charged for our meal in full.

96,John C.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,13,,2.0,2014-06-23,"Open letter to BJ's   To whom it may concern, At first I didn't think this was necessary, but after speaking to a friend about my last 4 experiences at BJ's Alliance he encouraged me to notify the company in the hopes that they can rectify the problems.  I do not have specific date however, I am a Yelp user and I do not hesitate to review my visits.  Currently I have 27 check-ins there, far more than anyone else in this area so I know what good service is and what bad service as it pertains to this location.  In particular, on the last visit with my family for dinner, my wife ordered a California club flat bread pizza.  A customer would tend to believe the menu picture represents the product.  Not at this location.  The pizza had 3 small cubes of avocado, 3 or 4 pieces of grilled chicken and a minimum of other toppings. (This would be the second occasion where your menu photos do not represent the product served at this location.) My wife notified the waitress and the manager came over.  He promptly agreed to bring another more suitable pizza and said it should be out in about 8 to 10 minutes leaving the original on the table ""to nibble on"" until the replacement arrived.  Meanwhile, as everyone else ate his or her dinner my wife nibbled, and nibbled, and nibbled until everyone was finished.  The waitress came over and asked for desert orders and we told her we were still waiting on the replacement pizza. She left and the manager came out a few minutes later with the pizza IN A BOX.  He apologized stating he thought we understood that this pizza was to take home.  If I wanted take out I would have ordered it.  My wife came out to eat, only to be let down.   The Manager comped both pizzas but at this point we decided this was the last time we would spend out money at BJ's.  On the occasion before, that a party of 6 adults had dinner there, my neighbor ordered Fresh Atlantic Salmon, very tasty looking on the menu photo only to receive two small chunks of salmon.  Manager replaced it with a more suitable dish.  Time before that my son ordered a small cheese pizza and was presented with a small peperoni pizza.  Manager came over just by chance and asked how things were; we told him we had the wrong pizza.  He said he could have the correct order out in about 10 minutes.  Everyone was finished dinner before the pizza arrived so my son ended up taking it home.  Time before that the waiter took our order and only brought 1 of two appetizers.  I asked if he forgot the potato skin order and he said yes and he could put it in.  We told him to forget it.  I ordered wedge cut fries and received thin and crispy with my California Burger (best burger out there BTW) then we ordered a pazooki for my kids to share and the next time we see the waiter is when he brings the check.  I asked him if he forgot the desert and he said ""ahhh ill put it in as a birthday order so it may come out with a candle."" Those were the last 4 occasions I visited BJ's.   I love the atmosphere and the food (when its right) the beer especially at BJ's, that's why we, as a family frequented the restaurant.  But after the last 4 times we have decided to go elsewhere.  Cheesecake Factory is opening right next door and we have always received what we ordered at that establishment.  I am sure that will impact the numbers at BJ's Alliance.   I'm not writing this to get something out of BJ's.  I just wanted to give you an opportunity to maybe address the issues and correct them before you loose additional business.   Sincerely, John C Addendum- it's been 13 days since emailing BJ's and I have not received any response  by anyone. It goes to show you how out of touch they are with social media.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7280000000000006,3.0400000000000005

They were very willing to answer our questions and were nice about it. As for the food, we ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and the Scallops for lunch. The Salmon was a bit dry, but was very tasty. The vegetables and the couscous that came with it were delicious too. The Salmon was just perfect. I didn't eat much of the brown rice that came with it, but it tasted very flavorful too. The asparagus that came with the scallops was cooked to perfection. It was tender on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. The best part of the meal for me was the dessert. We got the Salted Caramel Pizookie, which was to die for. It was really really tasty. All in all, I think this place deserves a five star.

I've never had good service at BJs and I've been there at least a half dozen times.  This time was no exception.  We were seated promptly and that is one of two  good things I have to say about this place. The other good thing is, we were there to celebrate a birthday and the birthday person gets a free Pizookie dessert. They don't check if it's your birthday.  They just bring you a complimentary personal sized Pizookie.    Here's my latest experience at BJs.  I was in party of 3. It was a Saturday night at 6:30pm, it was busy. The waitress took our order, we all ordered a salad with our entree.  The waitress asked if we wanted our salad before our entree, we all said yes. I ordered the soup and salad and chose the chili and Caesars salad.  I was told the chili had sour cream, cheese and green onions in it.  I said it sounded great and our waitress walked away.  One of my friends ordered the same thing as I did and another ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and for her entree she ordered the scallops.   25 minutes later a single bowl of chili was brought to our table by a runner.  25 minutes is no exaggeration on the wait.  I mean, how long does it take to get salad?  We explained to the runner we never received our salad.  She asked us if we still wanted the bowl of chili and we said no, we would like the salads first.  The runner then said, ""Oh,  I can go throw this away.""  Do you want to speak to a manager? My friends said yes.   As she walked away, we saw her talking to our server.  I'm not sure exactly what transpired but the server had an ""Oh darn, I forgot to put in their salad order,"" sort of look. The server approached our table and apologized and promised to have our salads out immediately, which did happen.   The salads were ok.  My Caesar salad was swimming in dressing.  About 15 minutes after the salads our entrees came out and still we had not seen a manager.  The chili I ordered, had about a quarter sized amount of cheese (wish I'd taken a pic) and 3 pieces of green onion.  The food was far from impressive, especially for the price paid.  Soup and salad was roughly $9.00 for dinner. I could've bought a bag of salad mix, 5 cans of Hormel chili and a bottle of Caesar's salad for $9 and would've had lunch for a week and the taste would've been about the same.    The manager that night eventually made his way to our table and was very apologetic and made sure we had everything we needed.  We finished the rest of the meal.  Our check came and our server gave one of the most insincere apologies, hip thrown out - not looking at us, I've ever received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.568,3.1200000000000006

The service is hit or miss but for my visit here it was great. I met my mom and brother for lunch and got there early so I started by trying a sample of their octoberfest brew. They will let you sample any beer you want for a small fee and even have cute sample mugs.  It was too bitter for my taste so I went with my normal favorite, their blonde. It's deliciously mellow. I also like to start with their bacon corn fritters. They come sitting on an aioli that is slightly spicy and garnished with more bacon bits, corn, and green onion. I dare you to have just one ;-)  I've ordered many different things here that were all good, but I'm in love with their enlightened Thai chicken salad. It has thinly sliced bell peppers, grilled chicken, mango, jicama, avocado, sesame seeds, and an Asian chili dressing that is to die for. Plus it's healthy so as an added bonus I feel less guilty ordering a pzookie for dessert! Their salted caramel one is my favorite thus far with almond toffee, pretzel bits, a warm cookie, vanilla bean ice cream, and warm caramel drizzle. YUM!

Separately, this has a nine, large bar area w/ a wide selection of beers and a good view of whatever game you want to watch on well-situated large screen TV's which make it as good for hanging out on a Sunday afternoon.

Well keep on driving. Service was slow but waiter was courteous.  The highlight of the meal was the wings on appetizer. They are crisp and have good flavor, if I come back this maybe my meal next time.  So we were optimistic.  My wife and I tried to order a pizza without sauce and to get sauce on the side (I like sauce she doesn't). This wasn't possible because ""they are pre-prepped"". Ok then we will need another minute to look at the menu again. So wife got a Parmesan chicken and it was bland. The mashed potatoes we actually good. Fries where cold, and taste like they were frozen very recently. Kids got spaghetti and they seemed ok with it. But it looked like hospital food or at best what we use to eat in school cafeteria (minus the usda grade F surplus meat, which would of been a welcomed addition). Also got the chicken strips and child said they weren't warm either. After being told pizza wasn't happening I elected to get the carnitas cheese fries.  Normally an appetizer I decided to make it my meal. Again fries were cold but the stuff on top was warm or might I say even hot. But I won't get again.   So turns out for a place that has such a giant menu (almost as ridiculous as cheese cake factory's) all their food tastes like it is fresh out of the freezer section in the frozen dinner section at your local Kroger. (No offense tended towards Kroger) Their house root beer is so so. I've had it at other locations  it was better at those locations.

I did ask for more balsamic on the side. It had a light drizzle on the chicken and salad. The mashed potato was very good and tasted delicious with the balsamic glaze on it.  Ordered the triple chocolate pizookie. DELICIOUS!!!!!! SOOOO frickin delicious!!!!  My friends all liked their dishes and all the dishes came out correct.

We started out with their southwestern egg rolls and boneless wings with half chipotle dry rub and half buffalo sauce.  The egg rolls were good as always, the dry rub wings were good but they tasted like regular fried wings with a stingy amount of seasoning which had no resemblance of chipotle flavor . The Buffalo sauced wings were good as always. Where the experience went wrong was I decided to do the healthier route so me and my mom decided to share the turkey burger,and my dad got a barbeque chicken pizza. Well ,had I known the burger was going to be a pre-made frozen patty that they just cooked I would have stayed away, it had a odd texture and the burger was not cooked through, it was soft and gummy in the middle.  My dad's pizza was good but i never cared for the tomato chunks they put on top of their pizza.

15,Patti O.,"Martinez, CA",0,6,,2.0,2017-01-11,"I am giving 2 stars primarily due to the service. Using the curbside option, I placed an order at 4:30 to be picked up at 6:30. At 6:30 I pulled into the parking space for curbside pickup and called the number. It rang many times, with no answer. I finally went to the takeout window, but there was no one there. When someone finally arrived, I told her I had curbside, and she said she would have brought it out. She then advised that the order would be ready in 5-7 minutes and seemed to be surprised that I expected it to be ready at 6:30!!! So, did she expect that I would sit and wait in the car until she bothered to advise me that there would be a delay. And, why was there even a delay when I designated the time. I have ordered on line for pickup at other restaurants with no problem.  As to the food, I ordered the Kale and Brussel sprout salad. At most, there was the equivalent of 2 brussel sprouts on the entire salad.

Only one waitstaff was working while others were standing around. Told waitress we needed to get to a movie and short on time so bring the ticket while we are eating. She brought ticket and it had incorrect charges. Some of the order from our table and some from the table that was sitting next to us. Then when it was right she took our cards and forgot to remember what card to charge each bill to. Paying the bill took longer than eating the meal. Still finished meal and had to wait on check. And did not get out in time to make movie in same parking lot as our lunch meal took 1.5 hours in restaurant that was not even busy yet.

I wanted pasta, but last time i had it, i hated it. so i wanted to try something simple a chicken dish. but no that dissapointed me last time. so i got the pork chops this time with the white cheddar mashed pot. and grilled asparagus. it was superb, in fact i ate with 3 other people and i almost didnt want to share it with them. but good food has to be shared! the seasoning simple, and the cook was executed correctly. the mashed potatoes were a good filler along with the asp. my friends order pizza and a salad, the ahi salad was well plated but didnt taste it, my friends pizzas were good looking but very basic, not something id want to order so im glad i didnt get it. I did get a slice of the Bj's favs and its basically a supreme pizza and it just tasted boring. i tried the house Stout, it was different tasting, i did like it but its not one id have to have if i was craving beer so good attempt. again bj's is hit or miss depending on what you order but i was happy with my latest experience so i decided to write.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-worth,2.92,3.0,3.0,,2.9680000000000004

The ahi tuna salad is good too but beware of the little dollops of wasabi they put around the plate!

But I will still give it 4 stars because this was the first time I wasn't happy about the food and I've been coming here for years. I ordered the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl.

24,Vanessa A.,"Fort Worth, TX",40,23,1.0,2.0,2017-07-30,"I placed an online order last night at this location for curbside pick up, thinking I'd be in and out. I paid online at the time I placed my order and arrived to pick it up by 6 pm as requested. The waiter came out and took my card again, and I gave it to him thinking that he just needed to verify the information, but he went to run it again. When he came back to my car I asked him to verify that I would not be charged twice for the order because I'd already paid online. He hesitated and said that if I had paid online that's probably why the card hadn't gone through again and that I wouldn't be charged twice. He assured me that it would only be another few minutes for my food. When the food was ready, it was about 20 minutes past the initially requested time. A different server came out and asked us to check the food, and then requested payment. I let her know we had paid online and I verified that the funds had already come out of my account. She said the order still showed open. I told her I had already asked the other server about this as he attempted to run my card a second time. At that point she said ""Ok, have a good night,"" and left. No receipt, no checking with anyone else, just turned and left. To be fair, prior to arriving I had received an email confirming my payment and order, so I'm not sure why this information wasn't received on the restaurant's end. I really feel like it shouldn't be that complicated to place an online order, pay ahead, and pick it up.

We sat outside on the patio which was nice. We sat down for about 5 minutes, still no service. Finally the waiter comes by and says ""I'll be right with you guys."" Another 5 minutes go by, and we don't even have drinks on our table.  By this point we just thought about getting up and leaving. One he comes back we finally put in our drink orders. Another waitress comes by and tries to drop off an appetizer that isn't even ours, twice. After we got our drinks, it took another 15-20 minutes just to order our food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It had huge chunks or artichoke. Nasty. 2 minutes after our appetizer came out, our food comes out right after. My mother ordered chicken and mash potatoes with rice.  The mash potatoes tasted like something you get out of a box. I ordered the ribs which were delicious which is why the review is not getting a one star.  I don't recommend going here, service is awful.
