3,Nicole J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",51,106,309.0,3.0,2017-06-23,The food was ok. My fish and chips tasted like beer and I couldn't eat it but my husband liked it. The burgers were good.  My daughter's friend had the chicken chopped salad minus the chicken because she's vegetarian and loved it.  The hopstorm IPA was a keeper according to my husband. I had the strawberry splash which was a combination of pina colada and strawberry daiquiri. OMG. I could drink that all day. The service was GREAT.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004
13,Randa H.,"King George, VA",23,60,240.0,4.0,2017-06-29,"We tried BJ's for the first time on Tuesday with my 5 year old nephew who has been dying to go. We called ahead to make reservations but they informed us that they do not take them, however, we told them we would be there around 6:45 and they said they'd be able to seat us immediately. When we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait, which wasn't surprising because it is new. After 40 minutes we checked to see where how many people were in front of us and were told 3 parties, but we were seated not a minute later. They brought out pizza samples while we waited which was great but one of the hostesses made a strange comment about how we should be thankful we were being seated as we were taken to the table.  We had three servers assigned to our table who were very knowledgeable and friendly. They took our orders quickly and did pretty well with the tablets they were using considering they haven't been open long. Our food didn't take that long considering how busy they were and our drinks stayed full.  The menu is huge and we had a little bit of everything - ziti, burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and the kid's spaghetti. We also shared three pizookies and a beignet. OMG. The dinners were all great and sides were very large. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. The ziti was amazing and the chicken on the sandwiches and salad was so crispy and juicy. The desserts were out of this world too.  Prices were average for that sort of restaurant. We had two appetizers, 6 dinners, one kid's meal, four desserts, and four alcoholic beverages for $155.  We will definitely come back and try some more of the endless options on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088
54,Peachy K.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,13.0,3.0,2017-07-01,"Felt the food pricing was a little on the high side. This isn't California. The avocado egg rolls were delicious. The atmosphere/decor was inviting. However, because of the high ceiling, it was a little loud and hard to hear your table companions. The biggest issue was that ALL of the staff was training one other person, each. There were WAY too many staff in there. So we constantly felt like we were being hovered over, not as in, ""Can I get you something,"" but just  because the mass quantities of staff were everywhere, all the time. Training in shifts would have been better than having every single server in that place, also have a trainee tailing them. It also seemed like the servers were assigned tables all over the place instead of each having a traditional section where their tables were all near each other. As a former server, that was weird to me and seemed inefficient. Our drinks,  a sparkling water and plain water were brought 5 minutes apart. Also weird, considering that the plain water was the one that was delayed. We didnt really try too much food as the avocado egg roll appetizer filled us up pretty well. We ended up just sharing a boneless buffalo wings. Both items were well done. I look forward to trying a pizza or maybe, the parmesan crusted chicken next time. But, please, for the love of God, cut down on how many staff you have training all at once. It was like a zoo in there. Way too much going on with that, to relax and really enjoy your meal. All in all, BJ's is still working out the kinks, a week after opening, but they show strong promise!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=60,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
36,Bertha C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",3,56,135.0,5.0,2017-07-01,"Decided to stop in today for dinner with the family. The fact that it just opened recently I expected the wait to be long. Arrived around 4:17pm with the anticipation of waiting about 30-49 minutes. Hostess said the wait would be around 25-30 minutes. Great, not to long.  They took my name and had me enter my telephone number so I may receive text when my table was ready. Received my text at 4:36 pm. Good start so far.  We were seated and pretty much knew what we wanted, since we have visited other locations in the pass. We all ordered the mini pizza's (build your own), spinach and artichoke dip and a side Caesar salad. Overall everything was great, except I have had better dip. Did not have to wait long for our food and waitresses was very friendly.  Signed up for the app and received a free desert. Hubby and daughter enjoyed the Cookies and Cream Pizookie.  The mobile app is great, because you can get on the waitlist, order ahead and pay your bill.

45,Jeanne F.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,9,,3.0,2017-07-02,"Friday, 30 June. A test. We arrived right around 4:30 and were happy to see a parking space because it was busy. Most of the customers appeared to be either outside or in the bar. I asked for a booth in a quietesh area because I enjoy talking with a friend over dinner. Our table turned out to be at the junction of the kitchen, the entrance to the restrooms, a server computer station, the corner where dining room servers picked up drinks, and the intersection of four aisles.Initially. None of this seemed to be too terribly awful, but as time passed and the confluence of all the activities ebbed and flowed, it was horrendous.  The appetizer--calamari--arrived almost before the words were out of our mouths and was good. Dinner service was another matter. From ordering to receiving it took close to 30 minutes. We made no special requests. With the dining space just beginning to fill up there was no reason for such a long wait. The salmon was scrumptious, and the burger appeared to be hand formed rather than frozen which is always appreciated. The fries were limp and certainly not anything I would want more of despite the offer of ""bottomless fries.""  The noise level was awful. The anticipated conversation was impossible.  What I disliked most was sharing my burger with the flies. There is a big section of wall left open for access to the patio area so the flies were all over the meals. This HAS to change or the Department of Health will be closing this place down. The staff was warm and friendly, the food was mostly good, and the location convenient. I'll give BJ's a few weeks to settle in and try it again, but right now Harry's Alehouse is my goto brew house. And the bartenders there make a fantastic perfect SoCo Manhattan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=60,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

The service was friendly and attentive. Our food order got messed up but the manager came by and fixed things. The food was great, especially the peanut butter smores pizookie.

The salmon came out wrong, the sweet potato fries came out luke warm. Even when I asked to have the ice cream on the side for my desert it came out wrong also. They didn't offer to compensate the experience I had. The waiter said they don't do that REALLY? I'm not saying don't give this place a chance but the experience could have been a lot better!

QThe food is EXCELLENT. I have been here 5 times within a week. The pulled pork sandwich is one of the best I've had. The pan pizza has a nice crispy crust. The Southern Comfort chicken sandwich is amazing. We're a family of 6 and we each order something different every time we've been and there hasn't been one thing we've had we didn't like.  The bad: Service the first time was absolutely horrible. Our food didn't come out for 45 min and one dish had to be sent back for being cold. 2nd and 3rd visits things were good and the 4th was The best service I've had in a long time.

Almost fell on the way to the bar and to our table  because the floors are SO SLIPPERY!!  The menu is huge which tells me the kitchen is probably chaotic.  We ordered the beer battered asparagus appetizer which was ok, a few pieces were inedible. My date had the jalepeno burger and fries which he liked the burger but didn't eat hardly any of the massive amount of fries. I had the lemon thyme chicken with brown rice and very limited vegetables, definitely way too much rice. It was a little dry but ok.

49,Mary O.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,,2.0,2017-08-02,"Last night was the third time I have eaten at BJ's since they opened, and after what I experienced last night I was compelled to write a review. The first time I went for dinner last Tuesday, food was excellent, service was slow, but it was the dinner rush so that was understandable. Went back the follow day for lunch, it took almost two hours from the time we were seated until we paid our check, it was not busy whatsoever. With that being said, again the food was excellent, the service was horrible, only saw our server three times: order, food, check. Went again last night with someone who wanted to try it out, we decided to sit outside. WORST IDEA EVER!!! Do not sit outside, the service inside is bad enough, but the service on the patio area is atrocious. We were told to seat ourselves by the hostess, which we did, no one came to the table for 10 minutes, so I went inside and asked for a server, another 5 minutes go by, we get a server. He comes to the table and says ""are you ready to order?"" We had not been given menus or silverware or had drink orders taken, so I laughed and asked for menus. After another 10 minutes, I went and got our party menus. The server comes back without the menus we had requested and bluntly asked again if we were ready to order, we ordered our drinks, appetizer, and meals. Our appetizer came out before our drinks did (we ordered a water, and a pepsi), I asked the server if we could have silverware (our original server did not bring the app out to the table) 5 minutes go by, no silverware, app is now cold, I again have to get up and go inside to get silverware. Our original server comes to the table and asked how the app was, and we had to ask for our drinks which had still not been served. Our drinks arrived at the same time as our meals, I got the prime rib dip with sweet potato fries. My meal looked like it had been placed on the plate by a toddler, the sandwich was soggy, ice cold, in disarray and I had a total of 7 sweet potato fries. For a $15 dollar sandwich and $2 up-charge for the sweet potato fries I was shocked. My friend got the mushroom swiss burger and was served a steaming hot burger and a mountain of french fries. I would have asked for a manager but the server never returned to our table until I asked someone else running food for our check, and at that point we were just ready to leave. Sadly I doubt I will be returning to BJ's. I have eaten in two other BJ's locations in the past and they were phenomenal, sadly the Fredericksburg location is nothing like the other two I have been to. After being open more than a month, I can't really see a good excuse for such poor service and I was pleased with the food until the slop I was served last night.

Explained the problem and told him I could be there in 4 min. He stated it would take around 10-15 to re-fire and it would be taken care of. I showed up in the proper time period. I waited in the parking lot, in one the designated pick-up spaces. I waited approx 30 min with no response. I called the restaurant and asked for Ted, well guess what, he was gone! I did get a hold of Kaylab after 2 phone calls and explained the situation. He responded quickly, and gave me a free ahi tuna. I understand they may be going through some starting off pains, but this was not a good experience. I am normally a very patient person and cut staff a lot of slack. Going to have to really think hard about going back or give a better rating in the future  UPDATE: My husband and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to give it another try. Food was adequate. Service was good. Now here's the messed up part. Our bill was 186$. We paid and also got an additional charge of 166$. We we there yesterday to get it resolved.

Took 50 minutes for the server to bring us out most of our drinks. And he had forgotten mine again . Took another 10 minutes. So after an hour, all we had was our waters and a few beers. My friends left the table to go to the bar to get waters because we couldn't find our server anywhere before he arrived with 2 waters . Food took another 20 minutes and came out cold. We spoke to the manager and she was very nice and said we didn't have to pay for the food. I didn't even order food.

It's best not to have so much as it can overwhelm the kitchen but it all looked amazing.   The prices are much higher than I expected however. A small bowl of soup was almost 5 bucks so I passed on that.  They do let you sub sides, for example I ordered fish n chips but got the baked potato vs chips.  The tarter sauce was not good. It was not traditional but more of a horse radish flavor.  So I ordered ranch to dip the fish in but it was a watery sour cream look and flavor.    She said that the beer batter is darker than one may expect but wont mean that it's over cooked but it was a bit over cooked but tasty.  Next time she said I can ask them to cook it lightly.  I used the normal door vs the revolving as I am not a fan of those. I noticed one person here said they got hit by it. My hubby will love all of the super thin crust pizzas when I take him with me next time. It is a bit loud with music and tv's going too but it is in fact more of a bar style place after all. Only due to the high prices, I won't go often but I will come back. Another waitress accidentally dumped a whole glass if ice water on the lap of an elderly lady so that was odd but the customer took it all in stride.  I just left there and ate at about 4:30pm.  I will post some pics next.

38,Joe D.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8,7,3.0,1.0,2017-09-08,"Having worked in the service industry for thirty years I think I am qualified to say what I am about to say. No matter how busy or how new or how slow a restaurant is there is NO EXCUSE for a guest to sit at a table for more than three minutes without someone at least acknowledging them, let alone 7, yes SEVEN, minutes. There were two of us, it was 3:57 in the afternoon, it was a Thursday. The place was dead. We were seated immediately and we started to look at the tome they call a menu. I had to use the restroom and asked my husband to order me a drink. I returned three minutes later. No server had yet greeted our table. We waited. And we waited. There were two servers standing right behind us against the back wall jabbering about something. There were four servers meandering around near the host stand. There were two other servers attending the two other tables in our vicinity. We counted five different servers walk past us. We looked at our clocks and gave a time frame for how long we were going to wait. At the seven minute mark we got up. I asked the host on my way out if the computer says what time she sat us. She couldn't remember at which table she seated us, go figure, and when I pointed it out she and another host fumbled to find out the time. Frustration took over. I said that we sat for seven minutes and no one paid us any attention and we are leaving. I barely heard an apology as I walked out. I immediately called the restaurant from the parking lot. I asked to speak to a manager. After two minutes on hold I drove out of the parking lot. At the 7, yes SEVEN again, minute mark I hung up. We wound up at Red Lobster. Always friendly. Always prompt. One of our best service experiences yet. So, go see Ally at Red Lobster. She will take good care of you.

This was in spite of the fact there were plenty of TV's without patrons watching. This was after the games had begun. Extremely disappointed and will reconsider ever coming to this restaurant again. It's a shame. Have always had great experiences until now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
59,Kathy J.,"Sayre, PA",0,2,,5.0,2017-11-28,Wonderful dinner here tonight.  Absolutely the best flat bread pizza ever .  The service was great from start to finish.  Loved everything about it.  Looking forward to coming again soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=40,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
25,Marie G.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,33,53.0,5.0,2017-12-04,"I've eaten here several times. Sometimes there is a wait. The menu is extensive. I'm a vegetarian and my sister is a GF vegetarian. Both of us were able to select from a few different options. Everything was well prepared. The service varies, depending on the server. One server was exceptional and one of the others, not so much. Still worth the wait, with the hit or miss service. Extensive food and alcohol menu ensures everyone is happy. Sometimes parking can be filled up close to the restaurant, but there is plenty of parking, with a little bit of a walk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
2,Nicole H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,39,23.0,4.0,2017-12-05,"So, I went with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon/early evening. Ok at 4! We were immediately seated, it was busy, but not overly crowded. Atmosphere was really nice. Busy, but nice. Seemed family friendly. Our server Marky Mark (he says it's on his birth certificate), knew his stuff. He knew the menu front and back. Very, very personable, tons of fun. Needless to say, at the end of the evening he got a good tip. From all of us.  Now for the food. Appetizers: cheese curds (I'd never had them) delicious. Hot. Cheesy. Sweet potato fries. Not a fan on sugar and cinnamon on mine, but my compadre did and before she added it, I was enjoying them. Maybe a little too crunchy but still good. Some kind of flat bread thing with jalapeños and a bunch of veggies I like. Amazing!  For the main dish I got jambalaya. It was spicy, but not quite as much flavor as I would've liked. Either way, still a good dish. My companions had meals that looked equally delicious, but no one was in the sharing mood. Dessert. I had the baked beigne that came with ice cream and whipped cream. Still good. Needless to say, I walked out of there STUFFED! Definitely going again. And again. Aaand again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The garlic parm wings were so good and the croutons on the salads are probably my favorite (I know im strange).

22,Graham K.,"Spotsylvania, VA",23,9,,5.0,2017-12-10,Great place to come for happy hour! $4 for all BJs craft beers.  Try the Grand Cry - smooth Belgian style at 10% ABV!

16,Cliff B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",14,5,,1.0,2017-12-14,"Went to BJs for lunch today and will not go back. Got seated right away and waitress came to the table promptly. Since we were on our lunch hour, we asked how long to get our order and were told 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later we still didn't have our food. When finally delivered, there was just a sandwich and no fries. Waitress said they were out of fries and that they ran out yesterday too. Very poor planning for a restaurant that has fries with almost everything on the menu to run out 2 days in a row. We were not offered a substitute and had to ask for a reduction in the bill.  The sandwich was good but the experience was disappointing. If you decide to try BJs, make sure you have plenty of time to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
17,J O.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,5.0,2017-12-17,Came unexpectedly as a big group of 14 family members and was accommodated quickly to a table! Marky mark was our server and he did a great job!

15,Tim T.,"Haines City, FL",46,6,2.0,2.0,2017-12-19,"The beer on tap is good. Nice selection. The Bartenders are great. This is the only reason I didn't give it one star. However! The food is absolutely awful. I've given the place multiple attempts. And every time the food comes out incorrect, over or under done and it all seems to be pre prepared frozen food. If you go, go for the beer. Don't expect much from the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
10,July A.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,8,,4.0,2017-12-22,"Came here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. We've been wanting to check out this new place and it seems it's still the new place to check out in the 'Burg. I dropped off the wife to get us a table because the parking lot directly in front is tiny. TIP: It's easier to park in the bigger lot behind the restaurant. Wife was able to get the last table and we were seated. Service was good and they even brought out a complimentary fruit and bread plate for our 19m old. It kept her satiated till her spaghetti came out. They kindly allowed us to substitute penne pasta versus noodles. She enjoyed her pasta. We've found some restaurants use a ""watered down"" version of food for the kids menu and our daughter doesn't care for the bland food. My wife both enjoyed our entrees. She had the Nashville Hot and Crispy which had a nice kick. I had the Chipotle Salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The asparagus was a little lacking. They were quite thin and it didn't seem they chopped off the base as that part was very fibrous. This is a basic food prep for asparagus. Service was outstanding with drinks and food coming out timely. I'm glad this location has food as good as other locations I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

21,Kimberlee G.,"Ruther Glen, VA",77,1,,1.0,2017-12-27,Told we'd wait an hour. 2 hours later we haven't been seated. It's a Wednesday night..wtf?! Asked for some drinks when the manager came to apologize. Told he couldn't serve it over here because he couldn't ring it up. Wouldn't you think it'd be complimentary since we've been waiting for 2+ hours? We came here on veterans day weekend (Saturday) and got seated in less than 15 minutes?! Absolutely ridiculous. Won't be coming to this branch EVER again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Poor service, we sat at out table for 15 Minutes before I went and found someone to get our drinks and then it was another 15 before the drinks came. Needless to say ten minutes after that we walked out. Our order was never taken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

1,Melissa T.,"Alexandria, VA",15,106,84.0,3.0,2018-01-10,"We went for a friend's birthday in which we had a large group.  We were able to do separate checks.  The food was pretty good considering my dietary needs.  I had the Brussel Sprouts appetizer, Spinach stuffed mushrooms and the Tumeric Caulifower side dish.  These three definitely earned each 3 stars above. However, my husband wasn't pleased with his boneless wings and mozzarella sticks.  We wanted to pack up his leftovers and had asked for a box.  Half hour later, the birthday boy was taking a Blow Job shot and put the whip cream on our leftovers unknowingly. Shade was thrown at the waitress as my husband told the birthday boy not to worry about it since we never got the box, we had asked for a half hour ago.  The waitress stood there watching the birthday boy take the shot and never even got the shade.  I ordered dessert and the hubby just wanted more beer.  Hence our requests weren't even fulfilled an hour later.   This was the first time I never left a tip in my life (just my change of $2) and thank goodness even with our big party, the gratuity wasn't included.  Our server was dim witted and more concerned with the partying going on than serving us.  She had puppy dog eyes for the birthday boy (who was married) and said that he hated her.  Wtf?!  Otherwise, I would come back for the food but the service certainly did not make me want the food that bad unless I order for takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fredericksburg,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
