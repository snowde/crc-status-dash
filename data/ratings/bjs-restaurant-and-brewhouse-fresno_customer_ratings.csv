The home made cream soda was nothing to cheer about but my fiance liked the rootbeer floats. I ordered the fish and chips and was surprised when I received three oily battered fish on my plate. The fish was so coated in oil that I had to use my napkin to get some of it off. This also mutilated the taste of the fish. I couldn't even finish it. We asked the waiter about the pizookie which was what we specifically went there for. We opted for the macadamia nut and were brought out a cookie that tasted like dough.

142,Jeff F.,"Fresno, CA",1,18,2.0,3.0,2013-05-14,"This isn't BJ's' fault, but the parking situation on a Friday or Saturday night can reach a scary level. The ""valet"" area for Flemings (I'm guessing) needs to be eliminated entirely because all it is is a bunch of cordoned off empty spots.  Anyway, as you would expect given the parking situation, BJ's can get quite busy. Even so, I've never had any issues getting seated in a reasonable amount of time and I've never had issues with service once I'm seated.  I started out my 21st birthday here with one of the beer samplers. It doesn't look like much (and it really isn't, ultimately) but that thing got me decently loaded. I haven't had anything but the house beers at BJ's, and all of the ones that I've had have been good. Definitely worth checking out if you're a beer person and haven't tried BJ's offerings before. The food... meh. I'm notoriously easy to please, but I've never gotten enthusiastic about the food here. It's passable, but there's no ""wow"" factor. I think the worst offender is the cajun pasta; I can see what they're trying to do, but the result is a pretty generic dish that makes you wonder what exactly it is that you're tasting. Really strange, and it's a trait shared across many of their dishes. This all being said, I like their calamari appetizer and their pizookies. Say what you will about a dessert dish that amounts to a cookie with ice cream on it, but god almighty those things are delicious. Come to think of it, the last time I was there, I got a stout and an oreo pizookie.

Once it took an hour to reheat something. Restaurants should have your food out in an average of 12 mins. If there busy them maybe 15-20. Not 30 mins to 45 to almost an hour.

152,Michael C.,"Fresno, CA",26,345,68.0,3.0,2013-09-03,"Let me start by saying I have mixed feelings about this place. We walked in and was greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table. She said there was about a 10 minute wait. I seen that there was 2 open chairs at the bar, so I told her we would be sitting at the bar. She said OK. I did notice there was those little pagers on the hostess stand, but she didn't offer us one. So we sat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails and enjoyed the very large flat screen while we waited. I enjoyed a Abbey Ale beer on the very friendly bartenders recommendation. Great beer and only 4 bucks. After about 15 minutes, i figured I would go to the hostess station and see what was happening. She says and I quote "" Oh, there you are Mike. I have been calling ur name for a few minutes. I gave your table away, I will have one for you shortly."" I said, "" you knew I was at the bar!"" She said she was sorry and would seat me as soon as possible. So, back to the bar for another great beer. After another 15 minutes, I returned to the hostess station. A different gal was there, and she said, ""I don't see you name on the list"". I started to explain what happened and then the other gal returned and seated us right away. Normally I would be a little upset, but we were not in a hurry and were enjoying our time at the bar so it didn't bother me too much. But what are the little pagers for if they don't use them. Just sayin!!! After we were seated our waitress came and greeted us. She was very friendly and answered our questions about the menu items we were interested in. So we decided to order the- Calamari App BBQ full rack  Double deluxe burger The calamari came, and some pieces were cruncy and tasty and some of the pieces were soggy and terrible. How does that happen. Did they fry two batches and give it to us???? WTF?? The two dippin sauces were just average. Our salads came and they were fresh and tasty. I really like the croutons. They were great! Our dinner came, and I must say the burger and fries were VERY GOOD!! The patty's were cooked to med rare as I asked. They had a nice char on the outside and some pink in the middle. Very tasty burger!!! Now to the ribs. I must say that my better half is spoiled when it comes to BBQ. Not to blow my own horn, but I've been smoking meat for a long time and I can put out some awful good BBQ. The ribs were tender and juicy, but lacked a good spice rub. So the meat was somewhat bland. I can swear that I've tasted their BBQ sauce before and I've never eatin here before. So it kind of reminds me of one of those sauces in a bottle. But I could be wrong. Overall, this place is OK for me. I will come again and try something else cause the hamburger and fries were very good and our server was very nice.

168,Tashara H.,"Fresno, CA",106,332,312.0,4.0,2014-01-18,"So, we arrived an hour after opening and the place was nearly empty.  There were definitely more wait staff than customers. We were seated promptly. Our waitress seemed a bit eager to take our order because after taking our drink order, she was back quite quickly to see if we were ready to order our meals. We asked for a few minutes, and she was generous to give us a few more than that.  No worries though--especially since we were not in a rush. We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer... It's been a while since I've been here...looks like they've gone through another menu pricing increase. I was surprised to find that six pot stickers now cost just shy of $10.  Oh well, a sign of the times, right?  I ordered soup and salad for my meal, and my hot date ordered a pizza. A few minutes later, two servers came out with my soup and salad.. When I informed them this was my entree and we were still waiting for our appetizer, they were a bit confused and seemed to want me to take my meal while my husband waited for his.  After an awkward pause, they agreed to take the meal back to the kitchen and bring it out after the appetizer and when my husband's meal was also ready.  Because I had made a few special requests for the salad, I asked them to just keep my salad chilled--no reason to toss a perfectly good salad due to timing issues. The rest of the meal was flawless. The pot stickers were nicely browned on one side, and very flavorful, my chicken tortilla soup was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and my salad was exactly how I had asked for it.  Our waitress was prompt in refilling beverages, and overall, it was a very nice meal. By the time we left, the place was busy with the standard Saturday lunch rush...and our quality of service did not suffer even with the busier dining room. In all, I don't mind if there are mistakes made at a restaurant--we're all human. What matters to me is how they are handled. The servers did not make me feel bad for requesting my appetizer first, and they were more than courteous and prompt...and of course--it helped that the food was quite delicious!

First thing I called in advance to try and get a Valentines Day reservation, the only problem they don't take reservations not even on valentines day, what kind of restaurant does this. Second off if you call in advance they can put you on the list for a table but you can only call 30 minutes in advance and they WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW LONG THE WAIT TIME IS OVER THE PHONE. This is a big problem for me. If I am willing to drive all the way over to BJ's and I can't even know how long the wait is for a table I might as well travel to another restaurant that will tell me how long I will have to wait for a table. They also have limited room to wait inside and a few benches outside but during the night time it gets pretty cold out there.  The Positives: The food here is great and if its not a busy night than go here and get a table. They brew there own Root Beer which tastes Great! The pizza is fantastic. The 2 person booths are a nice size not to small or to big.  The reason for the 1 star and not more is simply because I don't like restaurants that will not tell me how long I will have to wait once I get there. Also Not taking reservations on Valentines Day. I can see not taking them on regular days, but when you don't take them on valentines day your only going to piss off a lot of people who are waiting in the cold outside for over a hour, eventually they might leave for another place.

We originally had like a party of 15, which dwindled down to a party of 10, either way that is ridiculous, especially when the whole entire back of the restaurant was in unoccupied. They told my friend for her birthday that they only do reservations a half hour in advance, but when she called an hour in advance the person she talked with didn't mention this supposed policy.  We ended up sitting at bar tables while waiting, which was nearly impossible to get drinks and appetizers. We had to wait 15+ minutes between seeing a server which was frustrating when people would gradually show up for our party wanting to order.  When we finally got moved to the furthest part of the restaurant, it took a long time to get our food order taken after being seated. It took 30 minutes for two of us to receive our lukewarm soups. Then it was another almost hour wait to get our meals. What was frustrating is that at least 2 meals came out incorrectly.  At least our pizzookies didn't take too long to come out after ordering it, but one girl didn't get hers and by the time we were able to flag a server down and fix the problem, we were already waiting for our checks. I've never had to wait so long for a server to get our checks situated...  The first group of us arrived at BJ's at 6:30 pm, we didn't leave until 10:30.

Tonight is my opportunity to see BJ's shine! Our initial interaction was great. No problems! My daughter dropped one of her books and it was swiftly picked up by a passing waiter. Classy.  Our avocado roll was amazing. As was my Caesar salad.  For my main course I ordered baby back ribs. They were a little dry and a little tough. But they passed as really good with the BBQ sauce!

A must have that we order every time is the avocado egg rolls (sometimes we come and just order this along with dessert). I like to stay with the classic pizookie, so I haven't really tried the other flavors. I heard there was a pumpkin flavor, but I'm not brave enough to try it.  A complaint that I have is that some of the servers need to give better customer service. The last time we went to BJ's we were seated at a bar table and once our server came around we told him that we would like to go ahead and order our entrees because we were on a time crunch and that a person from our party had an important appointment to go to after we ate. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we came with 2 hours before the appt. We had ordered a couple pizzas and had asked if they would mind bringing us ranch and jalapenos. We had to ask numerous times, come to find out that our server had gone on break. We had to hail a waitress to ask her if SHE could bring us some ranch and peppers. She was not very friendly since we had to repeatedly ask her when she would bring it out. She told us ""Oh, I thought they already brought it out for you"". We urged her if she could just grab it for us since we were not very far from the kitchen, but she took her sweet time getting back to us, to which our party was already done with the pizza. After my sister said, ""Well we already finished our pizza..."" the waitress apologized (even though she DIDN'T seem sorry) but she did bring our dessert out on time. We waited 35 MINUTES just for ranch and peppers.  I'm assuming this is just an isolated incident, because other than that I felt that the food was fine.

We got our appextizer and my dinner salad all before we even got silverware. Our server never seemed to show up unless she was bringing us drinks or the one time she acually checked on us 15 minutes after we got out food. The food itself was ver underwhelming. I was absolutely appalled that they charge $3.25 for a side dinner salad that literally was so tiny my husband refused to even take a bite of it because it was so small. I should have sent it back, but with the lack of service, I'd probably still be waiting. Pizza was fine, nothing exciting or tremendous. My husband's fish taco's were the same. If it hadn't taken so long to actually get our food with the slow service we may have ordered a pizookie which is the one thing you can count on being good.

All of that said, my table was clean, the service was on point and the prices are reasonable. They offer a bevy of different options, I chose the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I know, my bad. This pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast marinated is combined with diced celery, red onions and a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing and buffalo sauce and that is the good part. The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft, almost mealy, doughy crust these guys have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie, BJ needs to actually go to Chicago some day. The Cubbies win more that BJ's Pizza's do.  Bleh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=40,2.6,3.1,3.1,2.6640000000000006,2.9000000000000004

I ordered online for curbside pick up and when I arrived I called the number on the sign and the girl that answered the phone hung up on me so rudely after telling me they don't bring your food outside. So I walk inside which was so embarrassing because I was in my pjs this was not part of the plan. Once I was inside I told the hostess I was there to pick up some take out and she directed me to stand like a dumb idiot by the bar area and I did. Since I've worked in the food business I was being patient then a few minutes go by and all the employees clearly ignore me and when I noticed they attended other customers before me I was out of there. It was not a pleasing experience. This type of behavior is unacceptable. I will never go back to this restaurant and I have contacted someone at the corporate level to make sure these employees step up their game because they are hurting this business with lousy employees such as the hostess.

Could say that I knew most of the management and the majority of the servers. After having moved away, coming back to this place seems like an empty shell of itself. A group of 12 of us decided to go last night, and I don't think I'll be back. Reservations were made at 8, pretty sure we didn't sit down until closer to the 8:30 side. That's cool, I understand some parties ahead of us would be enjoying their dinner. No biggie (had that been the only complaint). While waiting for our table, the bar area was accessible and easy to get drink. The bar is the only reason to come here. The bartenders are friendly and on the ball, make great tasting spirits, and do it at a reasonable pace. Finally sat down. Our first server took half the table's order, then halfway through, decided we were going to change servers. 15 minutes later, everything is settled and our waiter is now established. Ordered the calamari and best beginnings appetizers, a blonde, and the jumbalaya. The calamari looked sad. The best beginnings was on par with what was pictured in the menu. The jumbalaya was overcooked and severely lacking in rice; if I had ordered a small shrimp-stew, then that was what I received. Needless to say, I went home (hungry) and with $65 less in my pocket. So I showered because I felt so disgusted with my life decision and decided that I'd rather receive a colonoscopy waiting in line at the DMV rather than return to this establishment.

My nieces Mac and cheese had no flavor. It tasted like it came from a box. My sisters chicken Alfredo only had 3 small pieces of chicken. She ordered the full size, not the lunch size. The broccoli was over cooked and soggy. There was hardly any Alfredo sauce. The clam chowder was too salty. I order the lasagna. Except it wasn't lasagna. It's actually layered large ravioli with sauce on top. It tasted like microwave pizza. My sister sent the pasta back and it was taken off the bill. I should've sent mine back too. But I felt bad.

I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad and on the menu it says that there is cilantro in the salad. When we ordered the salad and asked for the cilantro to be taken out...the waitress was like yea of course and then she comes back and says that they don't put cilantro in any of their salads. Okkaaayyy... then why was it on the menu?? None of us got our waters refilled and I was so thirsty that I drank my friend's glass of water too.

So I call 24hr eats and then they are like you never selected the option to get silverware. Never ever ever in my life I had to select and pay for silverware and I even went back to the website that I ordered from and there was no option to even select silverware. At this point they transfer me to the manager at bjs and he says it's not his fault since they were supposed to charge me for the silverware they just can't include it. wTF. Since I ordered through 24eats there is nothing he can do about it so now my food is cold and j have no silverware no one will compensate me or even come pick up this cold food. Neither places will take blame for me not getting my silverware and I have never heard of a place that charges for silverware.

59,Umar R.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",876,622,7492.0,5.0,2015-06-18,"I love their pizza's! Pizzas is what draws me to BJ's,  their pizza is delicious and satisfactory if you fancy the thick (but not Chicago style thick)  fluffy soft dough pizza category with generous toppings.The pizza is not cheap for $24++ (LARGE), but come here for quality because they have it - their Spicy Hawaiian is my favorite and I highly recommend it if its your first time here. Their large sized pizza is great to be shared among 3-4 people through my experience, because its thick and fluffy, and generously pilled with chicken, pineapple, bacon, jalapeño, and tomatoes. I normally like to order online and I would highly suggest it because it is really easy, you can schedule a time and you pay as you pick it up. They have a curbside parking, and all I had to do it give them a call which is posted on their curbside sign and they will be there to get payments and also deliver the food. Plus you don't have to tip so that cuts the cost for students like me.  Their pizza is luscious. Let me start with the dough, the texture of the dough is very thick and yet soft and springy as you bite in, almost like a pillow texture.The taste of the crust reminds me of the once upon a time when pizza hut use to be good, it has a very addictive and palatable taste to it, and its very stable that you pizza slice does not fall apart as you hold it. Alongside, the topping were very generous, and i carefully use the word generous, because this place had piles of its promised toppings on my pizza. So you could imagine the grilled chicken, jalapeño, tomatoes, bacon and pineapple for my Spicy Hawaiian pizza was so much that I was satisfied. To add to that, they use real and fresh ingredients, no fake meat or fake canned vegas were detected, the roasted chicken looked and tasted like one.  My sister also ordered the angel hair Classico pasta, and I must say it was pretty spot on, the pasta was al dente and the flavors was very delightful and had a lot of depth for something so simple.  Im not sure about eating there at the establishment , since i have only ordered online and picked up curbside. But I would definitely try it in the future.

51,Ben C.,"Clovis, CA",68,69,2.0,3.0,2015-08-30,"Bjs brewhouse is a delightful little restaurant chain that serves some classic American style food without too many frills. With a wide open seating area, and a television screen any direction you look, it is almost reminiscent of a sports bar. This is in no way problematic as long as you go in recognizing that loud yelling from the bar area, and some random guys down in the dining area are frequent disruptions. Overall the atmosphere is boisterous and loud, but cohesive. The lighting makes it easy to read the menus without having to strain while also maintaining a level of dimness that makes it seem more cozy than it really is.  The service at Bjs is in-line with the ambiance. Although I have never had a bad experience, I have never really had an amazing one either. Aside from the fact that some of the waiters are really easy on the eyes, most of them seem like they are working their way through college. Obviously that is perfectly acceptable, but sometimes it can be problematic when they seem a bit distracted while ordering. As I said, no one has been too bad, just never that exceptional service that you hope for. The menu itself is a mishmash of Asian-fusion, Italian, American, and a few other things. I can honestly say that most of the entrees and appetizers are ok. They don't blow me away, but they also aren't bad. I never find myself ordering the same thing twice because of how good it was. Except perhaps the broccoli cheese soup. They only serve it certain days, and it is worth ordering.  Two items that they are known for are their pizzas, and their burgers. The burgers are, again, ok. They have big patties, and lots of different topping options. I have not had one in awhile due to being a vegetarian, but I can't remember ever feeling disappointed with a burger. The pizza, on the other hand, is very hit or miss. Served deep-dish style, the pizzas are offered in a variety of overwhelming flavors. BBQ chicken, the Great White... the list is long, but overall is entirely underwhelming. I can say that I haven't really had a pizza I liked at Bjs. They don't provide that ump you expect of good pizza, which leaves me craving some nice cheesy sauce pizza from some other local pizza shop.  Finally, the reason I keep going back to Bjs, they have desserts. The Pizookie (pizza cookie) is perhaps the most famous item on their menu. A fresh, hot, thick, gooey cookie topped with some creamy vanilla ice cream, how could that be bad? I would suggest sticking with the classic flavors. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, or white chocolate macadamia are all winners. I have also had the Oreo, the Red Velvet, and the Ghirardelli double chocolate, all of which left me wishing I had ordered one of the originals.  All in all Bjs is a great little chain. Before I gave up drinking I could always rely on their bartenders to provide a tasty cocktail, they have entrees that are worthy of your 12 bucks, and the desserts are all bomb. If they weren't so much like every other chain they would be worth four stars, but there's just nothing unique about Bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=80,3.24,2.92,2.92,2.7,3.0480000000000005

My previous dining experiences have been the epitope of  mediocrity. Tonight however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is obvious that there has been some real work to exceed expectations going on!  We came in and had a bit of a wait, 25 minutes was quoted but I'm sure we didn't wait that long. While we were waiting large groups of Cal Fire battalions were coming in and out, I'm positive they fed over 100 fire fighters this evening. We were seated and waited on promptly. Our server returned and took our order. Shortly after our server returned with a relief server and said he was going on break. I must admit my only thought was; ""here we go, time to get forgotten, I hope our order got put in"". Yea, I was that person! This couldn't have been further from the truth. Our service was impeccable! Our server was attentive, sweet to my child, and had an overall positive demeanor. Just Excellent!  The food. I've always liked the food here but I think the good service made it taste that much better. We started with a calamari appetizer that was crisp, hot and included two delicious dipping sauces. My husband ordered a tavern pizza, he said it was flavorful, cooked well, and the meats were good quality. The presentation was nice, it is served on a pizza skid/plank and looks great. I ordered a mini chicken bacon ranch pizza. It was the perfect size just for me. The deep dish is irresistible savory, crisp crust and chewy center cooked through. The chicken and bacon were the real deal, I could actually taste lean white meat chicken and real bacon, no bacon bits. The red onion was sliced thin, well distributed, and complimentary. The ranch drizzle was tangy and delicious. The pizza was great! My daughter had Mac and Cheese with a fruit cup. I am so thankful that the food came out on a cool plate, at a temperature appropriate for a child. She was able to eat right away and was a happy camper. A happy toddler makes a happy mommy! She even ate some of her fruit cup.  We had such a good experience that we ordered dessert. We never order dessert.  The whole meal was reasonably priced.

180,Erin A.,"Fresno, CA",50,63,70.0,2.0,2015-09-14,"I was hesitant to come here again to watch a football game as we came for one game last year and felt rushed. They were promoting watching the game there, though, and everyone knows that's a 3 hour ordeal so we decided to give it another try. Bad idea!! This visit was even worse than the last! I got off work late so my hubby sat in the bar, ordered an appetizer and politely waited for me. He later placed our pizza order with a comment that I wasn't there yet but I should be there before the food comes out. Not 2 minutes later, a server drops the salads off to my bewildered husband. 15 minutes later, the pizza comes out to a table with 2 untouched salads on it! How utterly and completely rude! At least the server noticed that faux pas and had the pizza immediately taken back (but they later delivered the exact same pizza to us). So I show up after a stressful day at work ready to relax and watch the game but am immediately greeted by a salad that is in the way of me enjoying the half of the appetizer that my hubby kindly left for me. So I move the salad, eat the appetizer, eat the salad and then they bring out the exact same pizza which is now lukewarm and dry. Why they didn't just re-make the pizza baffles me. It had been waiting at least 30 minutes - don't they have health rules about how long cooked food can sit? So after one slice of this lukewarm nonsense I push my plate away in disgust. The server immediately comes over to pick up my plate, get our pazookie order (which I refuse to give her) and leaves with ""I'll bring you a box"". A BOX!?! My husband is still eating! So she brings us the box and asks about the pazookie choice AGAIN and my husband and I say ""No we haven't decided yet!"" in perfect irritated unison. BTW, it's not even halftime yet...  So we continue to refuse to give our pazookie order until the 4th quarter starts and then we don't receive it until the 2 minute warning and it's barely warm. Nice to know some servers have a sense of humor. But of course my husband still insists on tipping 20%...

7,Kat T.,"Fresno, CA",3,28,20.0,2.0,2016-05-06,"If you review the previous comments and ratings I have given BJs in the last two years, you will see that quite recently my husband and I have not been enjoying our date afternoons here of late. And for many reasons. The main, of which as far as I can tell is there is a HUGE issue with the local restaurant management as far as:  1: There is just not enough servers and WAY too many hosts during lunch and dinner hour.  And for the love of all that is Holy, HIRE SOME DAMN BUSSERS!  Seriously; as it is I can see your servers sweat, pant, and hustle trying to serve a half full house with only less than a third if the amount of employees on floor needed to efficiently serve all of them, before every one walking in is waiting on not only to be seated, but also waiting 25-30 minutes for a drink because your server is trying to clean up the table and has not even had the time to write down your order yet!  Stop being a bunch of cheap asshole capitalists and take responsibility, HIRE BUSSERS!  2: Morale in general with every employee is so low you can drag your tits on it. ( I wish I were joking ) EVERYONE, is working so damn hard and clearly no one gets recognized for shit. I have been there, I can see it. I would never work for your company. It is clear that pure profit is the only thing that matters. Service to your patrons and proper management to your employees is a clear waste of time.  3: The Chefs in the back give zero fucks about their jobs. All the food is either overcooked, raw in the middle, or they mess up the entire ticket. No matter what something is always wrong! And it will take 25-30 minutes to get it fixed, only to have it overcooked and dry as hell, or bland and still raw.  This is a HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE CUSTOMER. Is BJs supposed to be a restaurant and brew house superior to most here in Fresno? Is it not supposed to have at least an inkling of decent standards? Maybe even, supposed to be considered swank, high quality, and an experience to remember?  Your cuisine ( if it can even be called that because your cooks and Chefs can't even cook on a DENNYS scale.) is priced at anywhere from $9.99 to $25.00 per entre! Why would my husband $15.99  bison burger come out burnt!? McDonalds would have been better!  So WHY, pray tell; would I rate you even a 2 stars?  Well, because not only do I submit my review and experiences here on YELP. But lucky for you guys, my husband happens to know the management running the regional BJs.

171,David L.,"Fresno, CA",63,9,,5.0,2016-05-21,"Price: Standard for a sit down restaurant, as you normally spend more than $12 per item. Though I think most people will let it slide. Food Quantity/Quality: The food quality is very good. One of my most important criteria is that I don't get sick because of the food. I haven't gotten sick! I ordered a deep dish pizza with Italian meats, and it was pretty good. My one complaint is that it was poorly sliced and hard to get out of the pan, but given how busy they were, it was Fresno States Graduation night, it's not that big of a problem. I enjoyed every single bite, and I liked how the pizza was more toppings than sauce. I hate my pizza to be 60% tomato sauce, and this pizza avoided that pitfall.  Service: When I got there the place was PACKED. It was Fresno States Graduation night, and was logically going to be full given that Fresno State isn't that far away. It also happens that their location puts them right across from Mall, so they're usually busy anyway. I was told that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table for two, but ended up being more like 10. I was taken to the table, which was just being cleared off and cleaned, but given the sheer number of people I'm more than willing to let it go. The drink orders were taken immediately, and arrived much faster than I had anticipated. Our main orders were taken, and the food arrived within 25 minutes. That's really good considering that every table in the building was full. Our waiter was attentive, even though he was waiting at least 10 different tables, and apologized profusely if he thought he was neglecting my table. Seriously though the only time was when I waited a hot minute for a water refill, but he handled it.  I've never had a bad experience at BJ's, and it certainly doesn't look like I ever will. Go here if you can. They know what they're doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=100,3.2,3.09,3.188,2.9960000000000004,3.134

I keep going back, so they must be doing something right. I think the problem and the reason are one in the same: they make a lot of mistakes, but the managers are very willing to make the necessary corrections to make the customer somewhat happy. My problem is there's always a mistake. And the biggest mistake they make is serving you cold, inconsistent food. I always order the same two dishes and it's almost exact when I say, every other visit, my food is good. Just like the other day when I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer. They forgot to marinade the Ahi in their poke sauce. They basically served me raw, bland tuna. I finally realized what the problem was and the waitress brought me some poke sauce, but never offered an apology or an option of getting another Ahi Poke made correctly. Nope. She just acted like nothing and charged me for it. I've come accustomed to things like this at BJs.

It's a chain restaurant, but as we all know...some are better than others and some others, well they plain suck, so it's always good to know which ones to avoid, right? Right. This was a visit to the Fresno location near Fashion Fair Mall. We usually avoid the location like the plague only due to the crowds and well...we're not really fans of people, in general so we try to avoid them at all costs.  We came on a weekday around 2pm, pretty steady inside, not a ghostown and that was all good - BUT....my god, the fact that they seat full-grown-full-size adults into those tiny little wall tables for two(when there were PLENTY of regular-sized tables available) - pretty much will fit a 95lb girl-child and her millenial bf who pretty much counts on his beard to make up for his barely 160lb frame while wearing skinny jeans and flaunting a man-bun. Yeah THAT ain't my Hubs. He pretty much gets called ""Stone Cold"" and mistaken for Steve Austin almost every day, which cracks me up, but it is uncanny - THAT being said...he's a big dude and likes his elbow space. I'm 5'10"" and every time set us in these tiny little seating areas...Hubs needs his elbow room and there just AIN'T any of that in those tiny little 2-person booths. We usually have to request to be seated elsewhere due to that, but Hubs was just annoyed already (yeah, I was too, hell yeah - HATE IT but get tired of having to f@#$ing ask every single damn time!). So we sit in the magical tiny seating booth and start to look at the menu - it was mid-day so I was going for lite (and I had to keep my purse on my lop as there was NO where to put it - and I don't put my bags on the floor, no thank you) - I ended up just getting an order a fries as I LOVE LOVE LOVE those skinny tiny crispy little shoestring fries and love they give you a big basket of them...and Hubs had the chopped bbq chicken salad (whch is ALWAYS good) - everything came quickly and the salad was beautiful and Hubs was stoked.  And then.....I saw the fries. Wha????? Wait....The fries were NO LONGER......the tiny skinny crispy fries - they've changed them up. Oh yay - the ONE thing I wanted and they managed to screw that up. Plus, they brought about a handful in an order. Needless to say....completely disheartened and irritated beyond explanation - those fries were the cornerstone of many a sandwich. And those fries MADE the perfect companion to those sliders. These were frozen (despite the effort to seem not frozen) and barely fried. Delivered lukewarm (odd since there wasn't any wait for the food, really, as it wasn't busy or crowded). There was a complete lack of crispness to them...so yeah, I didn't even finish them as it was just lukewarm pasty-blech. I did let our server know how disappointing it was...but she said it was a change they made recently - not really with a reason, that she was aware of anyway. Horrible decision and honestly - one of the things I say to Hubs on a fairly regular basis ""babe, I'm in the mood for some GOOD fries...where should we go?"" - yeah BJ's is now permanently OFF that list. I won't even bother ordering fries there at this point. They were awful - and exactly like just about every chain restaurant.  PS: I gave 3 stars due to the server (she was awesome) and the chopped bbq chicken salad.

22,ルービー,"Fresno, CA",46,61,153.0,2.0,2017-08-01,"THE WORST restaurant experience ever! I understand they were busy but they had some food issues too. I can let go of the fact that they forgot to give us silverwares....but no sauce on my pasta is a little too much. Apology accepted by the manager and the server, but I'd still give them 2 stars. This place needs a push for improvement. 1st: they didnt give us silverware to eat with. 2nd: when they served the food, my mom asked for silverwares, the person who took the food to the table just looked at my mom and said they'll give us some, but NO ONE EVER CAME BACK. 15 mins later, food had gone cold, some of us still couldnt eat. Two in our table who had salad were able to eat since they were given a fork...the rest of us couldnt. 3rd: they got my order wrong. I ordered chicken alfredo without broccoli (substitute with asparagus since my stomach is sensitive to broccoli)....they gave me chicken alfredo WITH some broccoli (which is fine...i can just remove them and my husband ate em), and some asparagus, but WITHOUT the SAUCE. I've been to other BJ's before and this is the first time I've ever had a bad experience with them, and it happens to be the worst restaurant experience I've had yet. It took a while for them to get the manager. We had to flag them a couple times. :( The manager personally apologized and had the server retake some of our orders since theyve gone cold. Unfortunately, I had to leave at a certain time, and couldnt stay to eat by the time my replacement order got to the table. I ate the pasta when I got home and it tasted good. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno,2.52,2.95,2.96,,2.7780000000000005

I got a honey brisket burger (or something like that). But the edges of the burger were burnt. I only ate half and took the rest home. Ate it the next day for lunch and have been up all night with food poisoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=20,2.48,2.94,2.956,,2.7560000000000002

We arrived about 11 so we were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome!  As for my meal... I ordered the California Chicken Club with a bowl of Clam Chowder. The sandwich wasn't as great as I had hoped however the soup was delicious.  Will go back someday but not anytime soon. However, I will try something else next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=20,2.56,2.92,2.956,,2.7760000000000002
5,Veronica H.,"Visalia, CA",0,6,,3.0,2017-09-02,"This place is hit n miss, been here several times and I have no idea what causes them to be either really slow, not very attentive and the food being good or horrible. Things seem to happen busy or not busy, so not sure if it just depends who serving and cooking but they are not consistent. Broccoli cheddar, pizza and the pizookie seem to be always good. We've pretty much given up on this place though as somewhere we would love to go to ehh maybe .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=20,2.52,2.94,2.952,,2.7720000000000002

We were welcomed by the supervisor Michael and the service and genuine friendliness of Michael was great! It's very rare you meet a manager/supervisor who genuinely cares about their patrons. The food was great! Our two year old loved their pizza, my husband ordered the ahi tuna salad and said it was great tasting. I ordered the half rack of baby backs with the cheesy mashed potatoes: overall the food didn't disappoint us at all!  What was pleasant, as should be expected by any hospitality business, was the above and beyond service by the staff and the manager Michael.

32,Frank J.,"Long Beach, CA",2,1,,1.0,2017-09-24,"So here i sit since 10am at the bar watching the NFL games. I have spent over $60 and now they start inviting more families into the ""bar area"". By families, I mean extremely young children into the bar area. Who really thinks this is ok? Now Cory, the manager, comes up to me at about 1pm to tell me not to swear since this is a ""family resturant"". Let me tell you this, BJ's is a brewery and restaurant! Sitting young child in a bar area is wrong automatically. Never come here if you expect to watch a game in a bar atmosphere. Only come here if expect a chucky cheese type of atmosphere cause thats how this place is run. I would rather give zero stars if that was an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno,2.6,2.91,2.956,,2.7860000000000005

14,Spencer S.,"Sacramento State, Sacramento, CA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Came here yesterday night (Friday night) and it was insanely busy. I wasn't surprised I mean, it was a Friday night. However, upon walking in we were not greeted nor acknowledged by the hosts. My friend and I made our way to the bar because seating was obviously going to be a problem. It took five mins after sitting to be offered a menu and for our drink orders to be taken. My friend and I took awhile ordering because we were indecisive. The bar staff only checked to see if we were ready to order once and they ignored us once we were actually ready. It was ridiculous. Our food took forever to be ready. Especially considering we only ordered appetizers and a pazookie. Honestly, so many people on staff yet obviously not enough to ensure their guests are being looked after. We asked for our check and were given SO Much sass. Guess they couldn't wait to get rid of us. Furthermore, terrible service.  The  food was okay. But honestly could've done without the cavalier disregard for service exhibited by the staff working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=20,2.48,2.88,2.936,,2.72

39,Jeanna P.,"Clovis, CA",3,28,19.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"Called ahead in order to be seated quicker.  Due to the 25 minute wait we sat at the bar and ordered drinks & appetizers, the server was quick and polite. Once our table was ready we moved with our drinks and appetizers. Waited patiently for about 45 minutes without one person greeting us.  The waitress walked all around us but never spoke to us. Finally after an hour of no service my husband went to speak to manager, who very graciously apologized.  After this, the manager made sure we had a great waitress. The waitress was Chalena, she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. I watched her help customers in more than her section. If we had the service we got at the end I would definitely have given five stars because the food was great.  The service recovered thanks to the manager and Chalena.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno,2.56,2.85,2.936,,2.734

Service isn't great and there's almost always a significant amount of wait time. That isn't just this BJ's though; it's a popular restaurant everywhere so it's understandable why the service is the way it is. They're simply busy with many tables.
