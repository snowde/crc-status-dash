230,Bj L.,"Gainesville, VA",56,143,,4.0,2014-01-28,"Solid 4.5 stars. Attended the soft opening with a set menu and was very impressed! They have a great drinks list, a combination of local beers, national and international, and their own brews.The mixed drinks look great and they have several ciders and fruit beer options. Prices are very reasonable. Artichoke appetizer with lemon aioli was fantastic, batter was light and fresh. Mains were shrimp scampi (huge portions, slightly dry--ask for extra scampi butter) and meatball deep dish pizza (Spicy and tasty, though the tomato was a little acidic). The portions are HUGE!  Servers were fantastic and you'd never know this was a dry run.  I can't wait to sample more of the menu!

The place was packed but the layout accommodates well and we did not feel crowded. The server approached us right away and took our drink order. She also informed us they have $3 pints during lunch. This would be AWESOME if I was not returning to work after. The food was great. I got the half salad half flatbread with the roasted veggies and goat cheese. The goat cheese and veggies were perfectly paired and I was very pleased. The portions are perfect. They are not overwhelmingly huge and I finished my plate feeling satisfied. The lunch combo was I believe $6.99 so my total check was like $7.42. We all had great food and great service. It's also a cute place and would make for a fun happy hour.

Be sure to get the 8 beer tasting for $12.95. Full 5oz pours. Deep dish pizzas are good and it's great they offer to go. Best of all? They sell growlers to go, good idea for picking up dinner on the way home. Only gripe we had was the amount of time it took to receive our food. First week I'm sure it will improve.

320,D P.,"Haymarket, VA",0,20,,5.0,2014-02-15,My hubby and I have been twice and found the food fabulous and the service excellent. Maybe because they were newly open and still training servers but we didn't want for anything. I had the burger with the skinny fries and my hubby had some sort of chicken sandwich. Both were good.

311,Joe B.,"Gainesville, VA",0,2,,2.0,2014-02-15,"Just had lunch there for Valentines Day and was hoping for better. It all started when I called ahead to see if there was a wait, this was at 12:50PM. I was told there was no wait therefore we did not need to be put on the call ahead list. When we arrived at 1:10 we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. I realize 15 minutes is not a long wait but the should have been placing people on a call ahead list. When we were finally seated our waitress seemed very pleasant although she did not seem to know the menu very well and therefore, could not recommend much other than the pizza. We started with an order of the tortilla soup and corn fritters which both were very good. As for our main course my wife ordered the pork chops and I the jambalaya. My wife's food came out in a reasonable time, but mine took much longer. I told my wife to start without me, as her food was starting to get cold. When the waitress came by to see how we were enjoying our food she asked me where my jambalaya was and I had to look at her cross-eyed and tell her it had not come out yet. She apologized and went back into the kitchen to see where my order was. When my plate finally arrived my wife was done with her meal and I asked for a box for her left overs. As I am halfway through my meal and still eating while my wife is sitting there waiting for me, our waitress comes by and asks me if I wanted a box for my meal as I am still eating. I told her no, because I was going to finish it. This made me feel like I was being rushed out the door to free up the table. At that time we ordered a desert to take home, since we kind of got the feel of how long things would take remember I am only half way through my main course and was already ordering dessert. The next time the waitress came to our table she brought our check and took my empty plate, this was at 2:48pm and our dessert has not come out yet. Next I am overhearing the manager at the table next to us apologizing for the poor service and the patrons advising him that they just arrived and there had no problem at all. Then he realizes he is at the wrong table. When he comes to us and apologizes he had the nerve to say he had wished the waitress hadn't already processed our check because he would have bought our dessert. A little too late if you ask me. Anyways after he left we started to think about taking them up on a free dessert to bring to our neighbors who were nice enough to watch them while we could have a nice Valentines Day lunch together. We asked the waitress and they if this was possible which they had no problem with it and placed the order, it is now 3:00pm. 3:10 no dessert, 3:20 no dessert, 3:30 no dessert. Finally I got up from the table at 3:35 and the waitress was bringing out the dessert. She again apologized and asked that we give them another try in the future. I responded by saying it would be a while before we came back.  So in conclusion: Ambiance: Nice Service: Sucks (hopefully it will get better) Food: Mediocre (A step below Mike's American Grill) Management: Sucked (should have picked up our check and been much more involved)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=340,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
226,Stephanie J.,"Burke, VA",234,393,246.0,3.0,2014-02-17,"A great addition to the Gainesville restaurant market that specializes in large chains.  One of the most notable facets of BJ's is their extensive offering of, well, everything. The menu is more like a book and there is certainly something for everyone. The wine and beer offerings are extensive and they offer full bar service too. While the restaurant was noisy the atmosphere was friendly and the service was efficient. It reminded me very much of a Great American Restaurant. We had the cookie dessert and wine during our recent visit, both were excellent. We sat in the bar area because the wait for a table seemed as if it would be long (we were told 45 minutes). However, the bar area has tables and booths with exceptional wait service so we were not inconvenienced or off put at all. BJ's seems to be one of the better chains and I will visit again to review a more extensive selection of the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=200,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
202,Kelly K.,"Reston, VA",259,1638,1223.0,3.0,2014-02-18,"Spacious restaurant with a nice vibe although the music was a little too loud for my taste. It was packed last Sunday at lunch. We managed to get a seat in the bar area. Our waiter provided better than average service. The food was tasty though nothing seemed fresh made. Rather it was like upscale fast food. I tried the fish tacos and it seemed like frozen fish sticks with prefab lettuce, cabbage and cilantro that had no flavor.  Prices vary from reasonable to a bit pricey. The half rack BBQ was 17.95 which was pricey. It came with a small serving of tasty beans and a side order of choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=120,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
228,Karen M.,"Ashburn, VA",54,261,10.0,3.0,2014-02-22,"I did a little skip of joy when I heard BJ's hit Northern VA. I have many fond memories of the various BJ's in Southern CA. BJ's where I had my first legal beer at 21, where I learned what a growler is, what bruschetta is, had many good times with friends...the list goes on.  Just as I have evolved in the last 15 years, so has the food. It used to be pizza, burgers, nachos...now there are many more healthy options with salads, lighter sandwiches and such.  The deep dish pizza is still on the menu and the beer is still the same with 2 new additions and few seasonal's thrown in.   The fiance and I came for dinner and had over an hour wait to get a table. This location just opened so some of the servers were still being trained and you can tell some of the staff is still in the learning curve phase.  We wanted to chill out at the bar while waiting for our table, but there was a couple steps to get up to the bar.  We asked the hostess if there was a ramp to get up to the bar at the back of the restaurant (we couldn't see from the front door). She said no, we'd have to go back outside through the Take Out door which had a ramp. So, we went back outside, around and came back in. When we got to the bar it was pretty crowded, there seemed to be a lot of confusion and the bartenders weren't really paying attention to the customers.  Finally after about 5 minutes someone finally came over and said they were in the middle of a shift change.  Probably could be coordinated a little better.   When our table was ready we went back outside through the Take Out door, back in through the front door and were seated at a table in the back of the restaurant. I had the Ahi Tuna salad and thought it was quite good.  The fiance had a chicken sandwich and said it was ok. He got a Pizookie (the baked cookie) to go.  As we were leaving, near the bathrooms in the back, we saw there IS a ramp to get up to the bar inside. Sigh.  Anyway, I think this location needs a bit more time to work the kinks out, but overall it was decent and I'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=200,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

They apologized for the wait but almost 50 minutes to get a burger and flatbread is too long (we did not order an appetizer). Bigger than average bun and burger size, skimpy on bacon (2 slices of thin bacon not adequate for a sizable burger). Ordered steak blue cheese flatbread. Steak pieces were small and dried up. Blue cheese was too overpowering for the dish (I love blue cheese). Also ordered mac and cheese because i have to try it anywhere it is served. Bacon and breadcrumbs make it very greasy - it is kinda creamy but average flavor. I compare every restaurant to Sweetwater because they are affordable, always use fresh high quality meats and ingredients, and are consistent (small menu size makes a huge difference).

Damon.  We were literally sitting there for fifteen minutes before anyone came to our table.  when our table was finally visited, it was another waiter, not ours that decided to get our drink order.  when he finally came over we gave him all of the orders (appetizer, entrees,,) cause we had no idea when we would see him again.  he put all of orders in at once so, we ended up receiving oir entrees before our appetizer....they took the dinners back to re-cook,...I.e. heat lamp till our appetizer was done.... Damon didnt deliver that either by the way.  he didn't know whether they had guinness on tap, even though he had already served it to my boyfriend. he spent most of the night being social to the other staff.  And we were like one of the two tables that he had, the restaurant was not packed.  we ended up giving half the tip to the other waiter cause he helped more than our own did.  I wanted to like that place, but Damon made it sour for me.  probably will not return to that location....maybe vienna's will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=340,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

It was a busy night, but our waiter was friendly and attentive the entire time. I ordered a glass of wine and my bf ordered a double of whiskey. Very good pours, no skimping! Points for that. We also ordered the angus beef sliders as an appetizer. They were also very good and came quickly. For our entrees, I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken and he ordered the ribeye. My chicken was awesome! The white cheddar potatoes that it comes with were alright. I would equate them with wedding potatoes, not terrible, but not amazing.

The decor is very nice...and the service was good though our waiter became a little scarce once the food came out (which took a really long time). We started off with the pot stickers which very well could have come from the freezer section at Giant...nothing spectacular about them at all... My Bride got the Cajun shrimp Caesar salad and I ordered the grilled pork chops.  Both entrees were barely seasoned (I think the  only seasoning my green beans had was the salt that was added to the water when they were boiled). My Bride's shrimp were tiny and not well-seasoned at all...certainly NOT Cajun...the salad was very lightly dressed with what was not even a good Caesar dressing.  My chops tasted as though they just put a little salt and pepper and slapped  them on the grill. I've had much better food at the big chain restaurants (Chili's, Outback, McDonald's)... Needless to say, we will not be returning to BJ's...

Food & Drink availability was a game!  We had 6 people at our table and were told no less than 8 times that they didn't have a certain or food.  After completing our dinner, the waitress came back to say 1 of the Beers previously was now available, which our friend gladly ordered and liked (more on this later).  The waitress, Kaitlyn (sp?) was a bubbly and pleasant girl, but very forgetful.  We asked for ice water, lemons and a side of marinara, she returned to the table to check on us 2 times before FINALLY bringing each of the items w/her, that was after reminding her 2 times!!!  Now the checks, oh boy!  6 people at 1 both, all couples, we asked for the checks, she brought 4 checks, 2 checks for 2 couples and 1 individual check each for the other couple!  WTH?  After sorting out the check issue, we moved to the bar area (this is the more from above), 1 person ordered the beer that became available later in our dinner (different server in bar area), who argued with everyone that the type of beer 1 in our party wanted was not available.  After asking the waitress to listen very closely, it was explained to her, we know the beer wasn't available earlier, but they tapped a keg and now it was available, although she continued to argue she agreed to check AND what do you know, she returned with the beer that she said wasn't available! The reason I gave 2 stars was because the food was good! I had the meat lovers deep dish pizza and we shared potato skins, nice portions and very tasty!  Per others at the table, Fish & Chips were OK, small pieces of fish with very think and greasy breading, Fish Tacos were excellent!  The New York style pizza looked like a boxed pizza and didn't appear very appetizing.  I didn't taste it, the couple eating it, didn't finish it and didn't comment GOOD or BAD.

We waited for a little bit and a high top opened up and we grabbed it.  After fighting to get to the bar we were all pretty happy to have a dedicated server.  Our Server came over and took our order and everything was great for a while. Then about an hour or so into being there, she disappeared. Our food came out and she came to check on us and acted annoyed that we wanted more drinks.  About another hour into that a couple of our other friends showed up and one of them asked for a Bud light...apparently this annoyed her even further and she told my gf they didn't serve Bud light. However, since the guy at the table next to us had one, I went up to the bartender and asked. And wouldn't you know...  they do serve it!  In fact, the bartender asked why I thought they wouldn't; so I told her and she rolled her eyes and said she was sorry when I pointed to our server.  I'm not sure what that was all about. But it didn't matter, apparently our server got cut for the night and asked us to close out almost immediately after.  So we moved over to the bar and had a good time the rest of the time we were there.

The menus were cumbersome and not organized well at all. Felt like cheesecake factory menus. Their glutten free slection was very small. My GFs pizza was pathetic. My grilled chicken was over cooked and dry. The appetizer was so delayed it came with the main course.

The wait might not be annoying for some but we had an 11 month old so had we of known we would have gone elsewhere. They acted as if we'd be seated shortly. Once we were finally seated we luckily had a great server and the food was good.  But for us we don't plan to return because the food definitely wasn't worth the wait.

I thought this would be a good sign. We called ahead and arrived before 5 on a Friday and were still told we would have to wait 15 minutes. I'm guessing their strategy is to significantly over-estimate the wait time, because they seated us a couple minutes later. The waitress was fine, but our food tasted terrible. I had the scallops and my husband had a chicken pasta dish. My scallops and his pasta tasted like the main seasoning was black pepper with little else added. Both dishes were too dry to enjoy. I was really hungry, so I ate all the scallops, but the rest of our food was inedible, so we complained to the manager who told us to order something else. Now, I wouldn't otherwise order a burger at a place that is compared to cheesecake factory or sweetwater tavern, but I was too hungry to order another dish that could come out tasting bad, so I did. My husband just ordered dessert. The best thing I can say about the food that came out is that it was edible. The burger was greasy, the dessert tasted like it had been crusted in sugar.  I hate complaining to the manager, but I expect that when I do, he will listen to my complaints and be somewhat generous about the bill. Instead, when the bill came back, I felt that he suspected us of being free-loaders. He charged us for a side order of scallops and for the ceaser salad my husband ordered with his meal as well as the full price of the second items we each ordered. This was quite insulting to me.

Yea man, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The first problem is the menu is enormous.  There are well over 100 items and there are very limited vegetarian options. We started off with drinks, which ended up being the highlight of the meal. The beer was fresh and my wife liked her strawberry martini, though the waitress who confusingly took over for the first guy brought a Margarita by accident first. For appetizers we started with the spinach and artichoke dip and an order of the corn fritters without bacon. The spinach and artichoke dip was absolutely dreadful.  it was like eating Elmer's glue.  It was pasty, had no flavor and tasted like it came out of a can. The corn fritters weren't any better, they had no flavor and tasted frozen.  Maybe the bacon aioli that we didn't get brought the dish together but the fritters were bland and awful.  They didn't even taste like corn... At this point we just asked for the check.  We didn't see the point in getting anymore food if it was just going to be more processed, Sysco-tasting garbage like the appetizers were- especially considering the prices on the menu.

245,Scott H.,"Manassas, VA",215,561,90.0,5.0,2014-07-10,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this large chain brewpub/restaurant. My experiences with similar franchises - e.g. Gordon Biersch, Rock Bottom - have been hit or miss. The beer at these places tend to be rather basic (with a few exceptions) and the food tends to be overpriced and uninspired. Maybe it's an issue of greatly exceeding tampered expectations, but I was completely blown away with BJ's. I've been there twice in the last two weeks, and they are my new ""go to"" spot in the Manassas/Gainesville area. I stumbled upon BJ's Brewhouse while looking for something different for dinner - that served good beer of course - on the handy-dandy Yelp app. I had heard of the franchise before, but didn't realize that there was in one in Gainesville. I also didn't realize that Virginia Gateway had expanded with a ""Promenade"" - one of those swanky town-center type places with shops and restaurants that tend to be a bit more upscale. (Not quite Reston Town Center, more like Loudoun One or Stonefield in Charlottesville) It's a great addition to the area. My first visit to BJs was on a Saturday night, and as I expected from reading the Yelp reviews, they were packed. However, we were able to find immediate seating in the bar area while waiting, and we received our text for seating within 15 minutes. BJ's has a great app that allows you to view estimated wait time and add your name to the list to lessen the wait.  The other thing that makes the wait go by fast is their beer selection. I was impressed with their offerings. They brew the standards to appeal to the common beer drinker - light lager, kolsch, amber, Irish red - but they also have stronger brews, such as their Tatonka Imperial Stout. They also brew seasonals, and were offering ""Hoppy Scotsman"", a slightly hoppy Scottish ale. Unfortunately they had just kicked their Imperial Red Reserve. Unlike many brewpubs, they offer a strong selection of other beers as well. There's about 22 others on tap, and while most of them are standard stuff you'd see anywhere - the standard imports and macro-crafts - you'll find a couple of nice options, such as selections from local breweries Heritage and Old Busthead, and Stone Arrogant Bastard. Personally I'd prefer to have their house brews - they are all really good. My second visit was on the 4th with the family, and everyone raved about the beer. My father in law even took a growler of kolsch home. Still, if I were rating for just beer I would give them four stars. The food bumps them up to five stars. On my first visit I had a steak, and chose their awesome cheddar mashed as one of the sides. For some reason I had a craving for clam chowder, and I was happy to see that a bowl of soup was offered as a second side. The chowder was great, and my steak was cooked perfectly rare. I tried a bite of my wife's burger and it was great. On the next visit, my dad, father-in-law, and I decided to split two 12"" deep dish pizzas. We all agreed that the pizza was amazing. With the thickness of the pizza, the expectation is that it will be a heavy pizza. But instead, it's very light and with the right hint of buttery. I'll be hard pressed to get anything else on return visits. Well, except for the pizookie that is. What's a pizookie? I'm glad you asked. It's a large cookie cooked into a deep dish pizza pan topped with vanilla ice cream. And it's freakin' awesomesauce. You can order a full-sized one, or a trio of small ones, or a giant one to share for the whole table. I got a normal-sized salted caramel on my first visit and was in heaven. We got a trio with the family, and the cookies 'n cream pizookie stood out of that bunch. So to summarize, we have really good house-made brews, awesome deep dish pizza, and something to cure your sweet tooth. What more could you want? Well, how about great house made sodas - the wife LOVES the orange cream soda. BJ's delivers on all fronts for me, the wife, and the family. I really love their craft beer, but I channel Fred Durst when I say for me, I do it all for the pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=260,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.4440000000000004,3.0400000000000005
125,Tricia E.,"Lincoln, NE",26,29,1.0,4.0,2014-07-11,"I've been here twice thus far, and the results were different both times. The first time I went, I was very disappointed. I ordered the Moroccan Salmon with cous cous, and it was dreadful. The cous cous had ""mixed vegetables"" in it that were under-cooked and lacked flavor, and it was drenched in a bland tomato sauce. No flavoring or seasoning. The salmon was over-cooked, barely had any Moroccan seasoning, had no sauce, and was dry. I would rate my meal 2 stars; it was edible, but not enjoyable at all. The rest of my family got burgers and all seemed to enjoy their meals. The second time I went here, I ordered a medium rare steak and a tomato mozzarella salad. This meal was fantastic! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned so well. It was tender and melt in your mouth delicious! The tomato mozzarella salad was an excellent take on caprese salad, with chopped red onions and drizzled in balsamic vinegar. I'm getting hungry thinking of that meal right now! Definitely a 5 star meal, and would make me want to come back again. The wait staff were attentive both times. Also, call ahead seating is the way to go with this restaurant, as the wait times are very long. Even with call ahead seating, still expect about a 15 minute wait if you go during dinner time.

That was the problem, while the beers were tasty, there was nothing there which was so memorable that it would leavr me craving to go back.      Service was polite, but mediocre. They were very discombobulated during shift change. There was no coordination between the 2 servers, and they were quite slow. We considered leaving after placing the order because it took so long to arrive. I would go back, but I wouldn't rush to do so.

357,D. H.,"Centreville, VA",5,7,3.0,3.0,2014-07-19,"I've eaten at BJ's three times now. I'm always baffled by the enormous turnout in the parking lot. It always seems to be busy, but I wouldn't say BJ's food really lives up to its popular illusion. The first time, I ordered the honey-lime seared scallops with garlic brown rice. This dish actually made me not want to go back. It didn't taste bad, but the scallops had absolutely no flavor, and I couldn't taste even a speck of seasoning in the brown rice. I don't think I've ever had more bland food in my life.  When I was in California, we decided to eat at a BJ's there, so when I went for my second time, I ordered the gluten-free pizza. THIS was actually delicious. Both the taste and texture were like a regular pizza. It was thin, crispy, and flavorful. I'm actually very impressed with their GF pizza, as I've searched all over town for a good one and this has been the best one I've found. This renewed my hope and enticed me to go back to the BJ's in Gainesville and try something else.  The last and most recent time I went there, I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with blackened chicken, per the recommendation of the server, who claimed their blackened chicken was ""to die for."" The salad tasted good- the dressing was fresh and light and the combination of the cheese, avocado, bell peppers, corn, and tomatoes was perfect. However, I wasn't blown away by the blackened chicken. I was expecting some sort of flavor burst of cumin or cayenne pepper, but instead, I got chicken that was of course blackened on a grill, but completely lacking in flavor and spice.  One thing I have to give to BJ's is they have good handcrafted root beer and cream soda. But, who really goes to a restaurant for the soda?  The service was okay..definitely nothing to write home about. The hostesses that I've interacted with aren't all that friendly and the waiters seem a touch pushy about getting you to order drinks, apps, and dessert to hike up the tip.  I'll probably go to BJ's for their gluten-free pizza, but aside from that, it just isn't worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=160,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.9560000000000004,3.2400000000000007

They have an impressive lineup of draught beers in addition to their own locally brewed craft beers. Interesting to learn they have won brewing awards going back to 1996, check out the photo. I stopped in for lunch and had their chicken tacos which were part of the 'lunch specials'. The menu said they came w/corn tortillas so I was a bit disappointed as I prefer flour. Emily was quick to point out that flour tortillas were an option...done. The two tacos came with a side of black beans and chips which put a nice finish on a light lunch along with a pint of Oasis Amber.

The rice was grainy and mushy, the scallops taste entirely different than any time I've had them....they have been doused with pepper and are rendered in edible. The asparagus has been cooked so much it's shriveled and the tips actually fell off like pine needles from a dying Christmas tree. These asparagus probably begged for their lives before being butchered mercilessly.  Not a fan.

And the menu is pretty huge but nothing on it is interesting or sounds extremely appetizing. Hence why I settled for a salad. Well it was awesome to eat half of my salad, ask for a box, and then as I'm packaging the salad, I find a hair at the bottom. Ick. I will say they took it off the check and were apologetic, which was nice. I get it, you could find a hair in your food anywhere. I don't fault them for this but it was unappetizing.

145,Mike R.,"Sterling, VA",93,235,431.0,4.0,2014-11-13,"Have to say, I'm impressed with BJ's restaurant and Brewhouse. We went there for a birthday dinner for my mom.  The fiance and I got there a little early, so we hit the bar for happy hour.  I was impressed with their selection of house brews.  They must have had about a dozen choices of beers they make, and I didn't even bother looking to see what else they had on tap if anything... because, well, when in Rome.... So I had the Stout, which was in my opinion, an excellent stout.  It wasn't mellow and subdued like a Guinness... it was BAM! in your face with moderate hops and you could taste the alcohol bite, while still being creamy and delicious.  Not for the faint of heart.  It was a good beer and mighty tasty... and at 8.5% abv, Lookout! I really liked how they had a good description as well as listing the ABV and IBUs for all their beers.... I like to know what I'm getting into when I order a unknown beer.  I also would like to give them credit for not bombing all their beers with tons of hops.  It seems like most of the microbrews I go to nowadays just dump hops hops hops in all their beers and have like 100 IBU.  BJ's had a lot of beers with light to moderate IBUs with only their IPA being really heavy on the hops, like it should be. Anyhow, this isn't all about the beer.  We still have dinner to worry about.   First, let me start off the dinner portion of my review with a big shoutout to SAM our waiter.  He was awesome.  He did a great job putting up with our large party including kids and indecisiveness.  We never felt rushed despite us taking a long time to decide on our orders as well as lingering around after our meals were finished.  He made us feel very welcome and handled us perfectly.  He went over just about everything on the menu when he saw we were having issues selecting what we wanted out of their very extensive menu.  I mean, this place has everything from Pizza, to two different appetizer sections, to Pasta, to salads, to steak and seafood, back to burgers and fish tacos.  I mean, c'mon, if you can't find something you want to eat here, you might as well go eat corn with the cows. So I decided on the black and blue burger (with blue cheese on the side).  Speaking of which, Sam informed us that they make everything on site... so if there was ANYTHING we didn't want in any of the items, they could remove them.  That's refreshing to hear... that their food is made to order and not prepackaged or premade.  So yeah, I had the burger with the thin and crispy fries.  The fries were awesome... they were cooked perfectly.  They were what all fries should strive to be.  The burger was a solid burger.  Good for a restaurant, but could probably be outdone by a restaurant that specifically caters to burgers (ie. Melt, Rays Burgers, etc.) but I would say the burger was on par with what you would get at a restaurant that has a lot of stuff going on.  The bacon and sauce on it were both good. I also added a salad with my burger, with ranch dressing.  I have to say, the ranch was watered down and not up to par.  I'm somewhat of a ranch snob, and while it wasn't ""bad"" per se, it definitely had lots of room for improvement.  The rest of the salad was okay, if not a little on the small side.  I would probably skip it next time, frankly. My fiance got the roast beef dip sandwich, and she was not impressed.  It didn't taste like it was sliced to order.  It wasn't rare, or medium rare... or even medium looking for that matter.  It was just brown looking slices with mediocre au jus.  I had a bite and I agreed... I would pass on that dish next time.  The owners should visit a Blue Ridge Grill to find out what a french dip sandwich should be like. My sister got the kale and brussel sprout salad and added a piece of salmon.  HOLY COW, it was like a whole freaking salmon on top of her salad.  It seriously looked like the size of a brick.  I would say she got her money's worth for adding that salmon to the salad. All things considered.  I would definitely return for happy hour.  Where the beers flow for $4 and you can also get buffalo wings for $4 (5 piece).  I almost forgot, I shared some wings at the bar with my fiance, and they were solid wings.  I was a little disappointed in the bartender.  I asked her what kind of style they had for the wings... and she gave me crazy eyes like I was asking a weird question.  I was like, you know... hot/mild/bbq?  she was like, we can make them really spicy if you want....  Later, I looked at the menu, and they had like 5 different sauce choices.  Oh well, no big whoop, we had them standard-style I guess, and they were good.  Nice and crispy and came with a few pieces of celery... not bad for 4 bucks. Shoutout again to Sam.  He was the best dang server I can remember.  Best of 2014 fo' sho.  BJ's, you should give that man a raise... or a high five and a pat on the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=140,3.04,3.21,3.21,2.768,3.142

I could continue with more examples from the encyclopedia of a menu which is way too big, but you get the point. Prices aren't accurate.  I asked for sliders.

134,Mike R.,"New Orleans, LA",21,1,,1.0,2015-04-25,"I went in with great expectations about this place based on what I'd heard from friends. We went on a Saturday night with a party of five. We were told there are no reservations for anything less than seven people, but there was call-ahead service. We called in at 5:00 for a 6:30 arrival. When we got to the restaurant, there was an additional 20 minute wait...not a big deal for a Saturday night. They sat us at around 6:50 and we placed drink and appetizer orders almost immediately. The drinks came out within five minutes and the app within ten and we ordered our entrees along with the drinks around 6:55.  Then our waitress basically disappeared. She refilled drinks once around 7:10, then didn't return for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, it took a ton of time to flag down (what appeared to be) an assistant manager or a host...it was hard to tell because he didn't actually let us know which he was. This was around 7:40.  We told him we had somewhere to be by 8:30, and that we would like him to check on our food and to possibly bring our check out along with it when it was ready. He took ten minutes to go back in the kitchen, then return to tell us we were about to be served. We waited another ten minutes before we flagged him down again, still with no food. Now nearly 8:00 and seeing people that arrived after U.S. Receiving our food, we asked to have our food bagged up so we could make it to our other engagement on time. The ""manager"" said yes but seemed annoyed. When he returned to tell us the food would be out any minute, he gave us our check with 25% taken off.  No apology, only ""it's Saturday night, what do you expect?""  When I pointed out that our waitress didn't even bother to check in with us, didn't refresh our drinks or offer us any updates for more than 30 minutes, he said ""I guess I'll have to coach her up on that.""  No additional apology. The waitress came by and handed us the check, looking very confused that we didn't have any food but were paying anyway. The manager clearly did not clue her in as to what was going on. No apology on her part and no idea that leaving us alone without checking on us for huge stretches of time was any kind of problem. We paid and our food finally came out in to-go containers around 8:10...1:15 after the initial order.  It was clear the waitress didn't even place our original order with the kitchen and the ""manager"" was covering for her.  We took the food and left. I had the baked lasagna. It was bland and cold, but probably would have been okay if I'd been able to eat it in the restaurant fresh.  The food never sat well, and eventually made me sick later that evening (it didn't not stay down long).  TL;DR Moral of the story, crappy service (1:15 for simple entrees), crappier management (failure to take ownership of poor service), and food that made me sick. I won't be going back to BJ's anytime soon. I would recommend you do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=180,3.28,3.19,3.19,2.5320000000000005,3.226

Cons: (1) Terrible customer service. Waiters with (grossly) offensive body odor, waiters who do not come to your table for 30+ minutes, slow service (even on slow days), never answer the phone when calling ahead to be put on the wait list, and managers who just do not give a damn. (2) Food comes out cold half the time, lukewarm if you are lucky.  The must leave all items under a heat lamp until everything is ready, but it does not keep it hot. it is not unusual to have one item piping hot while the other is cold.  (3) In about every 1 of 3 visits, our order is messed up. Forgotten sides, wrong drink, etc...  Bottom line is although the food is good, the service is very hit or miss.  Either way expect it to be slow. Seated for 15 minutes before a waiter comes is never acceptable, 20 minutes for drinks to come is never acceptable, 40 minutes for a burger is never acceptable.  The fact that the manager doesn't respond to complaints is never acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=180,3.48,3.21,3.21,2.472,3.318

Don't look glazed and be prepared with silverware and if the table is messy and brought to your attn, wipe it Quality - 4 stars: The taste was phenomenal. Good use of spices and presentation was excellent. The fried artichoke was not my favorite and the carnita fries didn't come out piping hot. Also if you get the ahi tuna salad I would request cherry tomatoes as the big tomatoes come out well cut big like an Italian restaurant salad.

Fortunately it wasn't too busy otherwise we would of just left.  We killed about 15 min and then I received a text saying that our table was ready. So we were then seated. I'm not going to lie, I hated we were sat. It was a small 2 person booth at the very front of the restaurant. Not a big deal but... So we were greeted right away by a very friendly server. Very tall skinny white guy (I can't remember his name thought). He brought us out water and we ordered the sriracha Brussel sprouts as an appetizer. They were alright. I probably wouldn't get them again though.  For dinner we decided to split the California Chicken Club which was really good. I'd definitely get it again. It was- Layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic mayonnaise on grilled sourdough bread- copied that from their website. We also got the french fries as a side and they were the really skinny one. I was a little annoyed that we had specified that we wanted to split it and they brought it out on one plate. They didn't even bring an additional plate... So we just used the plate from our appetizer.  Our bill for those 2 things ended up being just over $17.  I'm still not sure I'm sold on this place.

I thought we were signed up, but couldn't remember, so I gave her our number. Of course, it didn't come up, she wanted to keep punching in numbers. UGH! I told her, I don't care about the rewards program, just seat us so we can eat!  I haven't had bad service here, but then again, I don't go when they are crazy busy either. I do love the avocado rolls here. They are best I've had. They aren't greasy at all. Hubby and I almost always pick the same entree. We were arguing (kinda) on who would get the shrimp scampi. I got that and he got the jambalaya. For $17, I felt robbed. A bunch of noodles, tiny bits of tomato, about 9 shrimp and 2 little pieces of bread. Boo!  The pizookies are to die for!

My sister got the Black and Bleu house burger, she's a little hard to please but still! This burger is suppose to have crumbles of blue cheese but it was more like a dressing dumped on top!

LOL. Another tip, if you get a carryout, do NOT grab the bags, and rush to your car. Go through EACH box in that bag, and be sure everything you ordered is there.

Restaurant is very CLASSY - Wait time - Always some kind of wait time, especially on the weekend. 25-45 min - Bar - It is nice bar - Service -Here is where problem is, waiters and waitresses are well trained and give positive vibe however MANAGER's issue is he/she is scheduling them short on a busy weekend. I can understand that they need to keep expenses in check for meeting targets and goals but I can clearly see waiters running around like crazy. They are managing large number of tables with huge seating. Please Please schedule more staff in busy hours. Service is very slow as couple times I waited 20 minutes for a refill. Not acceptable as they are working very hard but are outnumbered by issues.  - FOOD -It is very acceptable, we go there for avocado egg rolls.

Came here with my wife for dinner one evening. Her chicken came out under cooked, ewe, our server was too busy to come check on us, so I got up after a while and found another server, he came over and took the dish away and asked if she wanted something else, so she asked for another entree from the menu. After a long time our original server finally came back to check on us. At this point I am long done with my burger. We tell her what happened, so she goes to check on the replacement entree, she comes back about 5 minutes later with a menu and says they don't have anything for you. LOL seriously, we had been there for a full hour between the 15 minutes waiting to take the original order, 15 minutes for the food to come out, and 30 minutes after that. We weren't too happy to be sitting there for so long without proper service. She went to try and find a manager, but he was too busy to come pay us a visit. So, unfortunately I really don't think I am going to be coming back to BJ's. I have been to Uncle Julios and their service is fantastic also Firebirds has fantastic service too. I realize things are going to go wrong sometimes, but when they do there should be people that care and want to try make things right, but not here at this place, not say they are too busy. Update. Okay so they keep sending me coupons for bogo or 1/2 off pizza. Yeah I can't resist a deal. I think if you go here when it isn't so busy you will be okay. The brisket bbq burger is good. I just finally got around to trying the deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. They do cook the crust ahead of time and then stick the toppings on and cook it again.

Here' the thing.  Soup and salad.   How easy is that?  That should absolutely be the quickest thing out of the kitchen, right?!?!   So, it shouldn't be the thing that takes the longest to come out.    All in all, the service leaves something to be desired here, and I'm sure I can find another place to indulge in my soup and salad cravings that puts a smile on my face.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=80,2.48,3.01,3.01,2.472,2.7979999999999996

We just moved to the area and we were hopeful that it would be just as good as the other Bjs we would go too. But sadly it isn't.

68,Allison O.,"Aldie, VA",14,28,23.0,4.0,2016-03-08,"This place has LOTS of options for food and drinks! My husband and I found this place and decided to give it a try. The beer menu alone is enough to make your head spin! We took about 5 min to try and decide what we wanted to drink. I was REALLY amazed that they had a seasonal pumpkin beer on tap - and a pint was only $3!!! The bar tender said they are still trying to get rid of it from the fall! Are you kidding me?! Who doesn't love a good pumpkin beer??? I had 2 that night! :) For dinner I had the Seared Ahi Salad. It was pretty tasty. I wish they would have given me a few more slices of tuna, but the rice wine vinaigrette was on point and I love the pickled cucumber in the salad. For $15.75, I guess that price wasn't too bad. The bowl of salad is rather large and I only ate about half the greens and definitely finished all my ahi tuna! I would want to try a different dish next time as the menu is HUGE! My husband had the full rack of ribs that came with 2 sides for $22.95. He got the clam chowder soup and thin cut fries. They brought out the soup first is a BIG bowl and once he ate that, he was full! The full rack of ribs was no joke! It was the whole plate and then some! I sampled a small bite and the sauce was delish! He said the ribs were very good and even took half of the rack home for leftovers. Our bartender, Julia, was very nice and friendly. I did use the bathroom which I found to be really clean and the air freshener smelled awesome! We went on a Monday night after 7pm so the place was very quiet.  We will definitely be going back in the future! The only con I can see is that the menu is rather large and you will need several minutes to digest all the food and drink choices. The prices are a bit high, but the portions seem to make up for that (this is where the 4 stars comes into play - if the prices were a bit cheaper, I could give 5 stars). Overall, great experience!

After being seated we were greeted by a friendly server thankfully or I would have just walked out based on the hostess. We ordered a cobb salad, which was ok... and also ordered the new triple decker sandwich, which was absolutely horrible.  The bread it was on was disgusting, the meat seemed like it came out of a package and it completely lacked any flavor including the non existent italian dressing it was supposed have. When the sandwich was dropped which came with fries...there was no ketchup? who doesn't bring ketchup with fries? So I asked the food runner if he could go grab some ketchup for me and that took 4 minutes. SAD.

Food: the dishes are all delicious, I haven't had one yet that I didn't like...except when I went back for it the second time and it was not cooked well.  Some examples are fries that are soaked in grease (the grease was not hot when they cooked the food) or pizzas that are overly toasted on top (burnt veggies) or barely cooked dough.

This time we took his mom and aunt and didn't have good service at all. The manager/hostess was a little rude when we were going to be seated--we were going to sit in a booth in the bar but decided there's more room at the booths in the restaurant (I like the bar area for happy hour only.) When we came back down to get a table in the restaurant, my boyfriend's mom was looking at different booth sizes to see what options we had and the manager made some unpleasant comments like ""we have a system here"" and ""it will be a few minutes--we have people waiting at the bar for a table"" (which turned out to not be true since there was about 15 tables in the restaurant that were open), ""there's a party of 40 in the back that we are trying to handle right now"". I have worked many years in the restaurant industry so I understand how they are run. It was an off time (around 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon) so they weren't busy at all and it's a transition time for the servers which I completely understand--but she was rude how she went about it where the hostess that was there originally was so pleasant. The server was really nice and overall good, but very forgetful!! I highly suggest writing down orders so you don't forget!! My burger was completely wrong--sauce came on the burger when I asked for it on the side and the egg was cooked over-medium when I specifically asked for it to be well done. I didn't complain about the burger as I was able to eat half of it--the second half was too soggy so I didn't eat it. I thought maybe this was the kitchen's fault, but when I looked at the receipt, I noticed the server had rung it in wrong. My boyfriend's mom had asked for ice on the side for her tea and sweetener with it, but she didn't receive it until she asked again once we got our entrees. Overall the service was okay and maybe I'm too critical since I know what good service should be, but it's definitely not something to rave about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=220,2.6,2.74,3.004,2.604,2.684

My fiancé and I sat down and salted our drink napkins, so that our drinks wouldn't stick to them when they arrived. Our waitress came and FLIPPED the napkins over, getting salt all over the table and some on my lap. She said, ""They were upside down, I hate seeing the logo on the napkins it drives me crazy. You can put the salt now."" Shocked and laughing awkwardly, we let it slide. When it was time to order, I ordered the baked ziti and my fiancé ordered a MEDIUM  steak with fries. The food took almost 45 minutes to get to us, and the facility wasn't even busy at this point. We were about to walk out, when our food finally came. My fiancé's steak was as rare as can be, throughout the whole cut. We requested to get a new one, with a new set of fries as well. When the steak came back, half the fries were MISSING and the waitress said she was going to get it for us. We went the whole meal, never getting the other portion of fries we paid for.

Very high ceilings, and yet it doesn't seem impersonal. Comfortable booths and seating and the dining room seems very clean. Huge bar area with a very large selection of beers. Unfortunately, the ladies' room was a bit of a disaster. The trough sink was clogged, resulting in a few inches of water spread across the whole six-foot basin. Not attractive. They seem to add something new to their menu each time I'm there. This time the latest was a kale and quinoa bowl, which you know is all the rage. Everyone seems to have loads of kale and quinoa these days. But I do like it, it's a satisfying dish, so I ordered it. I wasn't in the mood for a large lunch or heavy food. It tasted great and I enjoyed it. My husband had a chicken sandwich that he enjoyed as well. In fact, I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there. My only negative is that everything seems to be somewhat overpriced. The myriad choices of beers are great, but they start around $6 and go up from there. The aforementioned bowl I had was almost $11, which is a bit much for what I could essentially get across the way at Cava Grill for less. I guess we are paying for atmosphere. Our service was a little slow, even though it wasn't busy. The server was friendly, but kind of forgot to check on us until we were almost done. In fact, I had to pretty much hunt her down for some lemon at one point, because she simply disappeared. I still like going here on occasion, but it's not really a favorite. It could be so much more, in my opinion, since they have such a great space.

95,Rocky J.,"Bristow, VA",1,6,,4.0,2017-03-22,"BJ's is a wonderful place for all! Families, Business dinners, prom nights, etc. I personally would recommend this place over any of the other establishments in the Promenade.  First, the environment is very relaxing, but positive with the friendly greetings when you first walk in, to the comforting service you receive from the waiters. BJ's is one of a kind and I don't think you can get much better in Gainesville Virginia, and I only say that because there's only a few places like this around the area.  The reason why I give BJ's four stars instead of five is because of some of the items on the menu, first let me start of with the Pindina. It has to be the worst item on the menu, the wrap was soggy and that's from the horrible cheese, and chicken that's put inside. The ranch dressing that was put inside of the wrap over powered the taste of the greasy burnt chicken and it made the wrap somewhat bearable to eat. Another reason I gave it four stars is because sometimes the Pizookie's are burnt, I mean the cookie that's the base is totally burnt and you can't cut it or eat it. Other than that they're usually very good, you just have to be lucky and hope that there's a great chef in the kitchen the night you go.  The best things on the menu (My personal opinion) would be there handcrafted burgers, or there fresh salads. With every bite you can taste the wonderful flavors of the burger and it's the type of flavors that will never bore you. That goes with the salads as well, they taste so fresh, and they put the right amount of dressing so your salad will never be dry or taste bland. BJ's will also give you more than enough food, and that goes for both burgers and salads. By the time you leave you won't want to eat again for weeks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=20,2.96,2.9,2.984,3.024,2.924

First off, we ordered an appetizer because there was a coupon online for one free appetizer with the purchase of 9.95 entree. The waitress then begins to tell me I cannot use my coupon without being a rewards member(BS). I then tell her I'll go ahead and download the app so I did and BOOM what do you know(same coupon as before). So at this point I'm just like okay whatever. It takes the waitress 45 minutes to bring us our appetizer. The table behind us was received their food and packed their to go boxes before our APPETIZER came out. So at this point I'm very agitated . I get another waiters attention because our waitress apparently forgot about us. Long story short she brings us the appetizer with no apology or reason as to why it took so long. Well, 5 minutes later our food comes out. I ordered the salmon pita taco with fries. It must've just been sitting out because my food and my dads food both came out cold and soggy. The fries were stale and cold. The tacos were literally the MOST DISGUSTING thing I've ever eaten. They were cold too, It had an odd sweet taste. They added cold slaw which smelled like the dumpster out back. The salmon was dry and bland. The strawberry lemonade was decent but it was wayyy too sweet. Needless to say after my long rant, that I will not be returning here.

I am updating because my wife and I attended a special beer dinner event last night. I had signed up for BJ's email club because they force you to do it to register for call-ahead seating online. That is how I was notified about the beer dinner. The dinner was five courses and featured beers from Sam Adams and a couple of BJ's beers too. The menu with the beer tasting was delicious and included some items from their latest menu. The beers from Sam Adams were perfectly paired with the food and not only were good beers but accentuated the food taste. Welcome beer: Sam Adams Boston Lager-a solid beer 1st course: Watermelon/Feta Salad paired with Angry Orchard (owned by Sam Adams) Crisp Apple and BJ's Berry Burst Cider-A really nice and light salad with a citrus vinaigrette and the feta and watermelon tasted great. Ciders were nice and light and brought out the flavors of the citrus and watermelon in the salad. 2nd course: Creamy Couscous Mac and Cheese paired with Sam Adams Honey Rye Pale Ale-the thought of couscous as a mac and cheese did not tempt me but I have to admit I was wrong. The dish is a base of couscous made like mac and cheese but it is topped off with bacon, tomatoes, and basil. So delicious! My least favorite of the beers, just not a lot of flavor in the beer but it allowed my favorite part of the dinner to take over my taste buds. 3rd course: Bone-in wings with Nashville Hot Sauce paired with Sam Adams Rebel IPA-wings were crispy and perfectly cooked inside. The Nashville Hot sauce is outstanding, a little spicy but definitely not too spicy. Served with homemade dill pickles, celery, and ranch. IPA and spiciness were a great match. Palate Cleanser: BJ's Midsummer's Ale which is a saison/farmhouse variety of beer 4th course: Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon/asparagus/couscous paired with Sam Adams Maple Red Ale-The glazed salmon had just a touch of sweetness from the cherry and was really tasty after we removed the dark fishy layer on the bottom side. For me the star of the entree dish was the asparagus. Perfectly cooked so it was still crispy but warmed through. I ended up drinking the saison with this part of the meal.The black pepper/coriander flavor in the saison made the chipotle flavor in the glaze stand out.  Palate Cleanser: Sam Adams Black Lager-a schwarzbier style beer-a sweet roasted malt flavor in the beer got my mouth ready for dessert 5th course: Churro Pizookie paired with Sam Adams 20 pounds of pumpkin-Cinnamon sweet goodness. Not really a cookie like the other Pizookies but it is short pieces of a churro with a scoop of cinnamon sugar dusted vanilla ice cream. I was so full from the rest of the meal I could not enjoy this dish in it's full glory but what I did eat was perfect with the pumpkin spice beer. I would like to come back just to eat it by itself. Service was outstanding for the entire event. Managers and servers all pitched in to make the event go smoothly. A Sam Adams representative was there to talk about the beers as we tasted them. It was nice to learn about the history of the beers. They even had raffles of neat Sam Adams themed items like pint glasses, t-shirts, ear buds, and keychains. I am really sad because I won a pint glass, earbuds, and a keychain but was stupid enough to leave them sitting on the table when we walked out.  Overall the experience was fantastic and we had a really good time. We are going to try to get a group together for the next one. I very highly recommend signing up for BJ's emails and getting in on one of these special event dinners. The next one is planned for some time in October and I will definitely be attending again.

There were three in our party, and plenty of chairs at the end of the bar. Though the three we sat in were squished together. We proceeded to scoot another chair down beside our three, and the bartender had an immediate attitude stating someone was sitting there. We knew this, and there was about 3 feet worth of room for his one stool. Again, we couldn't even get into ours because they were so tightly grouped at the end, so we simply slid them over a bit so we could sit comfortably. Not in any way disturbing the other Patron's seat. He went about his attitude for some time, we left and the overall experience was poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4?start=40,3.28,2.92,2.984,2.636,3.064

The food we ordered taste good, it wasn't bad.  But this is more of a typical chain restaurant with not much more to offer.  Probably great for drinks and happy hour though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville-4,3.36,2.92,2.976,,3.096

When asked to put football on the third TV in the bar area they put on professional bull riding. Wrong CBS channel. No one cares or checks.   The quality of food continues to be a hit or miss. Most often it's a miss. Tonight the ribs were dry, burnt and had no flavor. All of the flavor and fat had been rendered off of them almost as if they had been dropped into a fryer.

A gentleman came in and while he waited for a hostess to secure him a table he stood at the bar, ordered a sprite, and asked to have that channel changed to a different game.

It was really a great dish. I would easily go back just for that. I server was friendly and attentive. I also had dessert;  I had the Pizookie trio.
