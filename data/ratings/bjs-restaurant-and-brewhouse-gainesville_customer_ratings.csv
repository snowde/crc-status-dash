Service was horrendous. We sat around forever for drinks, then to order, then for our food to arrive. Once our food arrived due to the ""kitchen being busy and backed up"" it was cold. Mistake me if Im wrong but if your food takes that long to get to your table, it should least arrive hot. It wasnt even room tempature it was cold. Which means while our server was chit chatting with the other servers all standing around doing nothing, our food sat there getting cold.

I love microbrews, but am really not a fan of any of their house beers. The Jeremiah Red is alright, though at around $6 a beer, overpriced. On to the more important part, the food.  As best I can tell, BJ's is all about quantity, not quality. They give large portions, but almost every item I've tried has simply sucked. Their entrees seem to be the worst. Chicken Fried Steak, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, etc. Simply awful. As a big fry lover, theirs are awful.

They do have a legit happy hour with half of appetizers and mini pizzas and drink discounts.  The beer they make it overrated but they do allow you to taste some so it's worth trying at least one.

BJ's, however, is one of the few places I go where I get something different each time. They have great burgers, sandwiches, and pastas, but I think I can say that the category in which they truly excel is their specialty wood-fired pizzas. My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza that is better than any other similar pizza that I've had in town. I've been probably a dozen times in the last three years and for the most part the service has been good, but there's been a couple times that it seems like it has taken a lot longer than it should, both while waiting (when the restaurant looks empty) and while being served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=120,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.216,2.96

79,Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",111,362,176.0,2.0,2012-08-08,"I had never heard of BJ's before coming here a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised with the menu. However, I was here with 3 other friends and they messed up 2 of our orders, after making us wait for about an hour for food. First, they served my pizza with onions, which I had requested be taken off. Now, if there were just a few here and there I would have made do. But the pie was literally overflowing with sautéed onions, which I just am not a fan of. So I politely asked if I could get one without onions and the waitress was very gracious and apologized. My friends and I had already been waiting for SO long for our food at this point (which the waitress kept coming over and apologizing for, so I assume it was the kitchen's fault) that she said ""do you want to just keep that anyway while I have them make you another one?"" and I said ""yes, that's fine, thank you."" I guess she thought my ""that's fine"" meant ""don't make another pizza, this one is fine"" because I never got the 2nd pizza. My friends, also thinking I was about to get a new one, happily enjoyed this free addition to their meal and ate all but one slice of this already small personal pizza. So in total, I had one piece of pizza, stripped of most of the toppings. It was my fault for not saying anything when she came back, but at this point it was nearly 10pm and my friends had eaten their food, so it just wasn't worth it.   The second order mess up came when my friend just never got her food. They served 2 of my friends and me (with the onion pizza), but my 3rd friend never got her food--they hadn't put the order in and she had to wait for them to make hers. The manager gave us a free cookie dessert as an apology, though, which was considerate. Sadly, the dessert (a ""half baked"" red velvet chocolate chip cookie called a Pizookie) was insanely sweet and rich and I did not enjoy it, though my friends did, so a personal preference.   The bit of pizza that I did have was good, though I thought it was overpriced for the portion size. That, combined with the wait time for the food (over an hour, and the place wasn't crowded!) were enough for me to give this 2 stars in good conscience, despite the mishap with the pizza that I would usually brush off as a miscommunication and misunderstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=80,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8560000000000003,3.0400000000000005

They say they will stay open late however I have been there a few evenings and have been gently given the check when it has been a slow night.

If I had a group of friends who really didn't know what they wanted to eat and had no real sense of what all the food was I would probably bring them here because it is a chain restaurant that does a fair job of making a lot of different products for a lot of tastes. I think if they trim the menu by 25% and focused on a couple of great things they would probably do a little better.  The ambience is very loud a lot of music playing I'm busy nights you a lot of people hanging out at the front door or around the hostess station and it's very crowded.

Also, I frequently had to wait for my glass to be refilled though, to be fair to the waitress, their glasses are on the smaller side of medium and, when filled with ice, don't really hold enough for a thirsty person to drink and still have a lot of liquid left over.   Given the combination of price and service, I probably won't eat here again any time in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=80,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9200000000000004,3.5200000000000005

51,Josh S.,"High Springs, FL",7,84,,2.0,2014-07-25,"I don't understand how BJ's continues to thrive in Gainesville. I don't know what I was thinking during my last review. Granted, it was three years ago. I guess their success is partially because the location is convenient to the mall, NFRMC, and I-75, but so is the building behind Red Lobster, and a business couldn't succeed there if they gave away free food with unlimited government funds. On the other hand, it seems that BJ's will never die, no matter how many things they get wrong. It's not that the food is that bad... the Pizookie is a tasty dessert, and I always enjoy what I'm eating, even if it's not overly thrilling. They also have a decent beer selection (their branded beers aren't great, but aren't terrible), and they have pretty good lunch specials. In fact, the lunch specials are the only reason worth coming anymore. The space is way too big for its own good. To their credit, they don't have unoccupied tables at peak times, leaving customers scratching their heads wondering why they can't sit in the section with fifteen open tables. But it also creates chaos, because they have too few inexperienced servers assigned to too many tables. A ""quick"" meal will invariably take at least an hour, no matter what you order or how much you try to hurry up the ""check please"" process. Also, the food is extremely overpriced. Aside from the aforementioned lunch specials, you will be hard pressed to get out of here for under $15 per person. So, so, so not worth it. I'm annoyed at myself for writing such a long review for a chain restaurant (an updated review, at that!), but one more thing: this is one of the few places I have ever been that will charge you for infant-sized portions of a side dish. I hate to sound so entitled, but if I ask for a thimble of black beans for a baby, at least tell me that you are going to charge me over $4 for it. Might as well just order her an entree and call it a day. $30 for two beers, a margarita, and a baby black beans.

Some of the appetizers are hits and miss. I'd recommend getting the Sampler. Pasta and Pizza are great. Hamburgers are a little above average. Always packed at nights and the weekends.

But I found the whole thing completely overwhelming. We accidentally went on a Game Day, which meant we had a 90min wait. Not a big deal, but definitely should have picked up a menu while I was waiting to have time to really look over everything, instead of just thinking I could pick something when we were seated. There are SO many choices for drinks and for food, that I felt like once I had decided on everything I might like to try, I had a usual restaurant's menu in choices. I am sure this means that some of the items suffer because the kitchen can't possibly keep up a high standard on ALL the items on that menu. Consequently I tried to pick something that wouldn't've been sitting in a pot or under a broiler for a long time waiting for someone to order it. I think that has to be the key to ordering here. Pick something they might have to make to order. I had a pear cider, but that doesn't even begin to cover the drink options here.

So, I suppose it fits in. Picture a Ruby Fridays or a TGI Tuesdays with more beer selection and you pretty much got it. Service was spotty, forgetful, uninformed. The place smelled like rancid fry oil, which explains the food. The food offered is almost entirely fried, overly-salty redneck food. Our table sampled a good bit of the menu, I had a ""pizza"" with the hope of it not tasting like everything else that went in the fryer that week (the experience with the sampler appetizer gave us a heads-up on that). It was like the puffy, salty, greasy, flavorless pizzas from WaWa. Even the Pepperoni was junk, below Hormel. I hoped the beers would get me through. After realizing they pretty much only had high-volume mega-brewer pee pee (sorry folks Shock Top is junk and it's Coors anyway), I turned to the bottled beer list. Hooray! They listed several domestic and imported farmhouses, saisons, and some sours. The server was pretty confused and pronunciations were a giggle, but one after another, he returned to tell me they were ""out of that one"". After several tries, he came back with a printed list of what they were out of to make it easier on me: it was pretty much their entire decent bottle selection (see uploaded photo).

The menu at this place is massive.  Pages and pages of selections.  It goes against every bit of the theory ""stick to what you're good at"".  It's obvious that most of the entrees and sides are frozen then steamed or nuked.  No kitchen can keep that much fresh food on hand.  It shows in the taste and presentation of most of the dinner items.  They do a pretty good job of steam and nuking though. The beers are pretty good and it's fun to try the different creations that they have.  Domestics are available if you have an aversion to microbrews. The best part of BJs menu are the lighter side entrees.   This is one of the few restaurants I can go to and order something that doesn't have a full days worth of calories, salt, and cholesterol in a single meal.  Some entrees are less than 600 calories.  Very nice.  I know some fast food salads that have over 1200!

They are located just outside of the oaks mall. It is a mile off I-75. When I drive from Tampa, this is my 2 hours driving stop. The restaurant customers are the Mall goer, UF student and professional. Very little tourist. Today I have the Classic Rib-Eye for lunch. I have their New York Steak before. But the Rib-Eye is the go to dish if you have to chose between the two. The dish comes with two sides. They have great selection of the sides in the menu. Today, I have chosen the roasted asparagus and the soup of the day - clam chowder. I like the ways they have select the material, the asparagus should be young and thin stem - less than ¼"" diameter. This is the best size that asparagus is not too fiber. The asparagus is grilled and season with spice. The clam chowder is actually comes in a bowl not a cup size. I have crust some black pepper on top. The clam is good chunk size. It is good for the hungry person. My rib-eye is come with good size also. I like it when it comes with a bit of fat that enhance the flavor of the steak. The gilled the steak to my order medium rare. I like the wood fire smell when they have the steak brought to me. This is typical American cuisine to near perfection. The meat material is good for the price that under $20. The restaurant has the handcrafted beer.

H.,"Gainesville, FL",121,8,,2.0,2015-11-28,"This was a disappointing visit.  My husband attempted to order the Southern Fried Chicken with something other than the red pepper succotash.  We knew this would be tricky, because, in the past, some servers have refused, but others have happily accommodated his request for a different vegetable.  Last night's server, Liana, refused, and offered the option of removing the red peppers and adding a separate side--for an additional charge, of course.  He ended up ordering something completely different (which came with asparagus that was improperly prepared, but that was the least of the night's problems). During the meal, the manager, Joseph, came to speak with us.  He attempted to pass off the succotash as a ""garnish,"" though it is, in reality, a side (2 ounces of anything is far more than a garnish).  Despite continually saying that he wanted to do what he could to make things right, he never really offered any concessions and, in the process of his ""explanation,"" ended up speaking condescendingly.  (One should never say things like ""I'm trying to help you understand"" or ""make this clear to you""--it implies that the customer is not intelligent.)  Joseph's explanation also implies that the kitchen staff is incompetent:  surely it is not difficult to get a ticket that indicates another vegetable be put in place of the succotash.  Given the enormity of BJ's menu, there are certainly alternatives that could be made.  It's clear that this is about laziness on the part of the server (and perhaps the kitchen, although they cannot be faulted for a decision made by the server).   Another aspect of Joseph's failed explanation dealt with ""consistency.""  We agreed that consistency was a problem, because servers on previous visits have made the substitution with no debate.  Perhaps the consistency the management should be striving for is that the servers consistently do what they can to accommodate what are extremely simple requests from customers; that's the kind of service that makes us want to return to a restaurant.  After last night's visit to BJ's, we're now rethinking if it's worth returning, knowing that simply ordering meals could become an ordeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=40,3.04,3.17,3.17,3.0160000000000005,3.118

90,Dylan R.,"Tampa, FL",68,5,,1.0,2016-07-02,"I should start this review by saying, I love BJ's... however I would not recommend this location. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar like we always do. After finally trying to order drinks, we handed the bartender our IDs. She had no problem with my girlfriend's Tennessee license, but mine was a paper license from the state of Tennessee which I had JUST gotten while renewing my license (I'm 23) 2 days earlier. The bartender took it to her manager, who then brought it back to me and told me she couldn't accept it because it wasn't laminated..... I explained to her that it wasn't lamimated because of the counterfeit-proof paper they use, but she wouldn't listen. The paper license is made out of paper similar to a dollar bill.. you hold it to the light, and it has hidden watermarks that couldn't be copied anywhere. Laminating a paper license that you could only verify when held to the light would make it an illegal license.. We left the restaurant immediately extremely disappointed without ordering, and walked to Buffalo Wild Wings across the parking lot who happily accepted my paper license at the sight of the official water markings. After a long day of traveling, all I wanted was a good beer.

We never got refills on drinks despite finishing them in about ten minutes into our meals (both our meals were super salty.) We even asked our server for more drinks and after 30 minutes he brought ONE water out for a table with two people. It wasn't a busy day. There weren't a lot of people there, but every single step of the meal took ages. We were seated pretty quickly, but it probably took 15-20 minutes for our server to take our order. Our food took at least 30 minutes to come out, and it was another 40 minutes or so before we were able to get a check.  My mom got a burger and the fries were cold by the time it came to the table. Her burger itself was also weird. The lettuce tasted slimy. It was just your normal burger, nothing fancy, but she didn't even eat half of it. I got the fetticine alfredo with grilled chicken and it was super heavy and really greasy. I maybe ate half.

52,Brian R.,"Marietta, GA",4,35,,1.0,2016-07-16,"Let me start with the fact that we frequent BJs. I've been going to BJs for 16+ years and usually get decent service at this location. Not sure what happened today...took maybe 10min before our server even got to the table, but we were told by a trainee that our server would be right with us. When the server finally came we were ready to order. We order drinks, chips and salsa, and lunch. My wife ordered her beer with an orange wedge. Drinks came, wife's beer had no orange wedge so I walked up to the bar to get one. Chips and salsa never came so I had to hunt down our server to cancel that as we wanted them before lunch came, wouldn't have thought we had to say that when ordering, got nothing but an OK, no apology or anything. When our pizza came, our daughters fries didn't. We asked the lady how long it would be for the fries, she rudely said 2-3 minutes and so ""pleasantly"" asked us if we wanted her to serve us our pizza, we declined. Our sever checked on us, we mentioned the fries hadnt come yet, she said she would check and again no apology. The fries did come a few minutes later. The entire time we were seated our server checked on us maybe 2 times while the tables around us had her and the trainees undivided attention, very frustrating. We paid and were leaving, I stopped the manager to let him know about our experience. He apologized and asked if there was anything he could do, he did seem sincere, but at that point it was done; just wanted to share our experience with him so he could address it with his staff. So, I thought this was the end of this bad experience. We were out shopping and realized my daughter had lost her security blanket. We didn't recall seeing it while we were shopping so assumed she had left it at the restaurant. I called to see and was informed it wasn't turned in and they couldn't find it where we were sitting, but she took my number and said she would call me if it came up. Luckily we were close by so 15min later I stopped back in to see if they had found it, and it suddenly appeared on he bottom shelf of the hostess stand. Clearly they weren't going to call me to tell me they ""found"" it. Not sure what that was about but pretty sure it had something to do with leaving our server $0 for a tip and me voicing my concerns to the manager. Needless to say we will be avoiding BJs for the foreseeable future, which is unfortunate based on my history of enjoying their pizza and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=60,3.44,3.3,3.3,2.6280000000000006,3.3560000000000003

The ambiance on the inside of the restaurant is quite nice, giving you an upper class type feel however the menu just does not cut it for me. I struggled to find something to order because nothing caught my eye. This was my second time coming to Bj's and I've noticed that they changed the menu. I used to order the cajun chicken pasta, but now that's not available anymore. I was a little stumped because the one dish I liked was now gone!! This time, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken as my entree which came with roasted broccoli and mashed potatoes, but I mistakenly swapped the mashed potatoes out for a broccoli cheddar soup (HUGE mistake)! The soup was extremely cheesy, so I did not finish it. I was told by a friend after my experience that the mashed potatoes are to die for, so if you are going to choose this dish, then I guess stick with the mashed potatoes. We also ordered a couple appetizers - avocado egg rolls, calamari, artichoke dip and a California chicken flatbread. All of these items were pretty good, but nothing special or different than what you can find at a TGIF or Chili's. The ONLY reason I would be willing to go to BJ's would be for their chocolate chip pizookie!! It is basically a cookie that is baked in a deep dish (like a pizza) and has a couple scoops of vanilla piled on top. The cookie is warm and with the ice cream, you achieve that melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!!! Plus, if it's your birthday, you receive a free mini pizookie with a candle lit in it!

The kitchen staff must have it absolutely insane in there. The menu has 22 chapters. With all area of pizzas. Ordered the flat bread pizza (it was horrible) flat bread was more flat and harder then a saltine cracker. Ok so now we know I clearly am not a fan of the food nor their menu.

15,Daniela R.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-30,"I LOVE Bj's and I have never been so disappointed. I ordered my food through Bitesquad and the food I got was a letdown. I paid a good amount of money for the food and what I get are the smallest 2 pieces of lettuce and 2 miniature pieces of chicken, it was more of peppers and sauce then Chicken for my CHICKEN lettuce wrap which I have ordered many times previously and I get a lot more then that. I also ordered the mini Pizookie and while I was eating it there was PLASTIC in the Pizookie. I have honestly never written a bad review but I am MORE then pissed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,3.08,3.25,3.25,,3.182
3,Pam S.,"Blountstown, FL",1,3,2.0,2.0,2017-09-30,"This was our 1st time at BJ'S ever at Gainesville...thought we'd give it a try. Kinda wish we'd never gone there. We went there after a game about 3:30 pm & wanted to grab something to eat before traveling back home for 2.5 hours. We were seated immediately, which was great. However, we waited 10-15 minutes before we finally HAD TO ASK for our waiter/waitress. She came within a few minutes & was friendly enough. It was another 10 minutes or so before we got the drinks. I had a vanilla cream soda float & that was very good. We ordered the stuffed spinach mushrooms with garlic pesto aoili sauce as an appetizer. When we saw them, we were disappointed at the size of them...of course, we didn't know what to expect being new. There were only 6 of them but other restaurants at least give medium to large sized mushrooms. They tasted very good. We had to flag down our waitress AGAIN to order our entrées (deep dish pizza)...THAT took another 10 minutes to locate her. She was flittering all around us, when we actually got a glimpse of her, but she was NEVER attentive to us. We ALWAYS had to ask other waiters/waitresses for what we needed. When she brought some refills on our drinks, she said that she'd bring us some parmesan for our pizza. Did she ever bring it?? NO! So, we flagged down yet someone else. She never even commented or asked (or apologized) for not bringing it. We had already eaten 4 pieces of pizza before we got some. When we were finally ready for the check & a to-go box, my husband finally got up & went to the little area where the waiters/waitresses were to ask for the check & a box. Seconds after the box was brought, she happened to bring the check & she saw that someone had already brought a box. We will NOT be going back to the Gainesville BJ'S again...and we are there often during football season. Maybe in another town.... maybe. The vast menu was somewhat overwhelming to go through & pick just 1 thing (besides an appetizer). It would be better to have maybe 4-5 pages, front & back....not 20. To end on a somewhat high note...we loved the ambience & warehouse feel of the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,3.04,3.22,3.22,,3.1480000000000006
2,Robert R.,"Gainesville, FL",55,55,85.0,3.0,2017-10-01,"I have eaten at BJ's many time. But, it's exceptionally average. I enjoy the atmosphere and all the sports. It can be a bit loud sometimes.  I tend to enjoy the food but I have had some disappointments as well. The chicken tends to come over cooked and isn't great to begin with. But the fish tends to be good and not over cooked. The deserts are good. Some of their mixed drink are really good. I enjoy a drink like that. It's pricey but delicious.  Overall, I don't turn down an invite to go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,2.96,3.22,3.22,,3.1160000000000005
16,Rick P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-01,"I have lived in Gainesville for 2 1/2 years and tonight I had the worst meal I have ever had in Gainesville! When the Grilled Chicken Alfredo was delivered to the table I found it so dry that I literally had to pull to separate the fettucini. I was able to find 2 pieces of chicken approx. 2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. On the plate were 5 pieces of broccoli which were cool and uncooked! I am sooo disappointed! My wife had Spicy Peanut Chicken with noodles which she said was flavorful with an adequate amount of sauce, but once again had only 5 small pieces of chicken 1 inch cubes. Both meals could not have had 1/2 small chicken beast combined.  The last time we dined at BJ's was about a year ago and the food was great and plentiful! What happened? I should have checked their rating before tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,2.96,3.22,3.22,,3.1160000000000005
9,Crag F.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,,5.0,2017-10-23,"Been here twice. And I'll be here a lot more. Menu is huge, not sure how they do it. Pizza, great - both flatbread and deep dish. Steaks, killer. Homemade guacamole, also great. Fish and chips, like from the coast. Seriously, not sure how they do so much so well. And their beers? What? Huge selection, all brewed in state, not far. I live in Charlotte, NC, and visit here to Gainesville often, so I'm not a local. There may be better places, but I doubt there's a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,3.12,3.24,3.24,,3.1920000000000006
7,Jen S.,"Streetman, TX",2,55,14.0,2.0,2017-11-07,Ok I am picky. Came to eat for lunch. Did the bar thinking it would be faster and waited by my table for three mins. Then finally a busboy came to clean the table. Almost walked out. The tomato sauce from the previous guest was smashed into the cleaning rag and the chunks came flying toward my tan shade shoes and the tomatos left streaks on the table . He didn't notice it wasn't clean and left chunks on the seat with the smear on the table.  We have the best waitress running full tilt however when the hostess finally arrived with menus she did not send someone to clean again. So my clean silver is resting on the paper napkins. Don't go here unless u don't care about cleanliness. I did ask the hostess to tell the manager but here I sit. I am ordering the prime rib!

1,Cierra G.,"Fayetteville, NC",196,121,195.0,3.0,2017-11-29,"I don't have much of a review for this BJ's location.  I've visited only one other BJ's location, in Tallahassee, FL, and I loved it, but I also went there to celebrate and have drinks.   On this particular visit, in Gainesville, FL, on a super long road trip back to NC, my husband and stopped here because we were hungry and tired.  We happened to come during lunch time, but it was early lunch, 11 am maybe, so the lunch crowd wasn't quite out and about yet. The hostess greeted us as soon as we entered the establishment and we were seated right away.  Our server came soon after and told us about the lunch specials.  She brought our drinks, took our orders and went on here way. The food was good, especially because we got a great lunch deal, however, it seems that she forgot to charge us for the special, she charged us regular price, but was quick to fix it after paying attention to our receipt. There was nothing special about this visit, just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville,3.04,3.21,3.21,,3.142

The beer is always nice and cold, apps and food on point and this time I had Ivana as a waitress who was wonderful. I even ended up getting a free Pozooki with my BJ loyalty points AND buying two movie tickets at a discount price ask your server for details. Score!
