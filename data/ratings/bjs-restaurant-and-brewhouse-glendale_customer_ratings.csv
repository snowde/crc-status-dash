I had to ask our server like 4 times to put on the Clipper game until i gave up waiting and Â had to ask another server walking by. When she came to refill our drinks, she kept reaching over me to refill my boyfriends glass while i was eating. She almost smacked me in the face with her arm a few times.

430,May P.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,226,2.0,1.0,2012-01-09,"After careful review of their allergen menu, I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza, as the dough is vegan, and a salad. The salad was great, but the pizza was the most pathetic piece of crap I've ever seen. They're not kidding about it being mini. And you would think that with a cheeseless pizza, they'd naturally put more marinara sauce on it or olive oil to retain the moisture. That's pretty intuitive, right? Nope. They basically just baked some bread, put some tomato sauce in the center and tossed in about a quarter of a handful of olives, bell peppers and onions on top. I'm not joking. They were so stingy with the toppings that I had to complain to our server that this was the most pathetic piece of crap I'd ever seen. $10 for a piece of crusty bread with some crap on it. C'mon man, I got nothing else on this pizza, and you're gonna give me this stupid excuse for a meal? I'm never going back here. It wasn't even comped. They offered to have them do it again, but honestly, by the time it came back out, my friends would have already finished the meal and would be stuck waiting for me to finish. Bull$hit.

468,Stevie K.,"San Bruno, CA",148,50,65.0,4.0,2012-01-11,"Glendale.  Saturday Night.  I'm in town for a seminar and all I can think about is where am I'm going for beer, food and place to watch the playoff games. BJ's naturally (especially since it's walking distance from the hotel).  Well I'm no stranger to BJ's so I knew what to expect. Delicious beer, decent food and a good atmosphere with good service. I've got to say that the place was fairly busy but I was able to snag a tall table next to the bar with my friends. Since I'm still sticking to my new year's resolutions I scan the menu for some healthy options and what do you know, they have a section just for this. It's called Lighter Fare or something like that. Well I'm debating between the Tilapia with rice and a chicken something or other. I ask the waitress which is better and of course she tells me both are great. I go with fish and a Lightswitch Lager which also happens to be low calorie, for beer at least.  Food comes out and it looked, smelled and tasted delicious. I pretty much wolfed the whole thing down in fifteen minutes while chasing it with two of those light switches. The only complaint about the food was with the rice pilaf. There were a couple of hard balls of rice, kinda like when you leave the rice cooker on and a ball forms at the bottom, but's that my only complaint. The fish tasted good, was tender and flakey and didn't stink.

432,Karla G.,"Los Angeles, CA",562,261,361.0,2.0,2012-02-03,"I am a huge fan of BJ's. I love their salads, pizza and beer. The BJ's we frequent the most is the one in Woodland Hills. Anyhow, I chose to have a dinner party at this particular location this week because it was closer for the people in my party. We got there and the hosts were very pleasant. We went in, sat down, and waited... and waited... and waited some more... By the time I was done reading the menu for the 100th time, I decided to get up and ask someone to please send our server over because we were starving. The host tried to chase the server down and was ignored. The server finally came over, took our order and... we waited.... and waited... and waited some more for our drinks & appetizers. Oh boy. ""This isn't going to end well"", I thought, so I calmly walked over to the hosts and asked to speak to the manager. Kate (the mgr) came over, was extremely apologetic and immediately took action. She took our orders, checked on our appetizers and drinks and slowly but surely things started to turn around. I explained to Kate that this was not a good time for our server to provide crappy service because I had guests there and it was a very important occasion, so I wanted everything to go smoothly. She totally understood and REALLY made our experience great from that point forward. She took the wrong appetizer back & brought us the right one, got us our drinks, got us chips & salsa and even gave us a couple of extra pizookies for the kids to make up for the frustrating first half of our dinner. She went above and beyond any manager I've ever dealt with at any restaurant and for that, I am extremely grateful. Thank you BJ's for having an exceptional employee like Kate, she REALLY, REALLY, REALLY turned a potentially awful situation into a positive one!  Kate also gave me a $25 gift card to compensate for all that went wrong, so I will definitely give this BJ's another shot and hopefully give them a better review as well. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=500,2.56,2.91,2.91,2.472,2.7700000000000005

606,Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508.0,2.0,2012-03-25,"I got a nasty ""compliment"" from someone that I know is friends with the waitress that I am referring to in my review below. I have taken this waitresses name off my review just to appease her, but I think it's lame that someone that I'm sure works at this BJs that knows this waitress to write someone regarding my review. Regardless if someone is a single mom or had a bad day, you need to leave your drama at home and work your hardest to get through it. Yelp is a public forum for people to write about their good and bad experiences. If I have to mention an employees name to steer consumers away from that person so they can have a better experience than I did, then I will do that. Here is my redone review: Would have given this place more stars had we had a better waitress. To all who dine here, stay away from _______(name withheld because someone was upset that a name was mentioned). She is the worst waitress alive, would disappear, lacked major communication skills and just flat out had the stink eye the entire time and her attitude sucked. Never saw one smile come to her face, she never wrote anything down and anytime we'd ask for something she wouldn't even acknowledge us. Asking for refills was the worst, we'd ask and she wouldn't even acknowledge that we asked, she'd just come back 10 minutes later and would just fill up our glasses, without even smiling, no your welcome, nothing.  I'm not a fan of the Burbank location and now I'm really not a fan of this place. The parking here sucks just as bad as Burbank too. Free 90 minutes. At the rate our waitress was going, we were just 15 minutes over 90 minutes. For some reason we owed $5.50 in parking for those extra 15 minutes. I'm done coming to this area in Glendale. ****I would also like to add that this review was not powered by the fact that I didn't get a smile with my refill like the angry complimenter had stated, it was because she was a rude person that day that didn't take the time to see if we needed anything else after she dumped the food on our table. Everything she did was done with attitude. What makes you think I would want to go back there and have her as a waitress after that experience?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=380,3.0,2.91,2.91,2.216,2.9460000000000006
477,Jen L.,"Oakland, CA",132,192,59.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"5 stars for excellent service! I know BJ's is a chain restaurant, and most chains don't have fantastic service just because they are a chain and will constantly have customers no matter what. But our entire table was thrilled by our server's (I wish I could remember her name) pleasant attitude on a BUSY Clippers' game Saturday night. Our large party (15+) had just come from our friends' wedding at the Methodist church a couple blocks away, and on a Saturday night, we were pretty sure everywhere would be packed and wouldn't let us in. However, to our pleasant, pleasant surprise, BJ's said they could accommodate some of us outside and some of us at the bar, which worked out perfectly since some were going to get drinks and others weren't. BTW, the entire lobby area was full of people waiting for a table, but they didn't want to sit outside. Even on a rainy night, the heat lamps offered plenty of heat, so sit outside to skip the wait! Inside at the bar, seating is open, so we were able to snag good tables and booths. Like I said earlier, our server was so fun - she gave us recommendations on apps and beers and had fun with us when we ordered our round of shots. The atmosphere was lively and fun in the bar area and lent to an excellent end to a Saturday full of memories! My big gripe (which is why I minused two stars) is that the drinks were unbelievably weaksauce; we even had to ask if there was any alcohol put into the drink. The mojito tasted like sugar water, the gin and tonic like water, and the cranberry vodkas like watered down cranberry juice. Sad since we're paying so much for the ALCOHOL, not the ice.

One of the worst BJ's Restaurants I have been to and one of the worst services received from a restaurant. The whole place reeked of bad service. The bad funk started right when we walked in. The girl handling the front desk was so incompetent and had no professionalism. I get that it was packed but you need to keep your cool and do your job. I could have slapped her and that would not have helped. We finally get seated and had to wait several minutes (well over 15) to get a menu just to look at. We actually had to get up and ask another waiter to bring over a menu. When our waiter finally comes around she introduces herself and this man she was training. Before I continue with the rest of the bad funk..... Why would you have the MOST incompetent employee training new staff.....WHYYYYYY????? We were starving when we arrived here and we probably lost about five pounds waiting for our food to come out after we finally ordered it. When they finally did bring the food out my Asian Chicken salad had NOOOO dressing....none what so ever. Really if I needed to cut down on calories I would have told you. My cousins California Chkn sandwich did not have mayo and it was requested and my friends order was actually okay. My cousin did not make it a big deal and decided to eat it anyway UNTIL she realized the chicken was bloody and raw. We then had to hunt down our server because she disappeared again. We did not find her but found the man that was in training. He apologized and took the plate away and said he will have the server come by. My cousin waited over 10 minutes for the server to come by. The whole time we thought they were bringing out a new plate but instead she just came over to ask if my cousin wanted a new sandwich and that the manager would be over to speak with us shortly after. My cousin asked for another COOKED sandwich.  When the manager came over (which we had not requested) he was not apologetic at all. He had the nerve to tell my cousin that they were not trying to kill her or anything.....and not even in a sarcastic way...So then he got a mouthful from us. We waited several minutes after and still no new sandwich for my cousin. You would think these people would make it a priority after they ""tried to kill her"" by feeding her raw chicken. We once again went on a hunt for our server (who was not apologetic at all) and told her we were leaving and wanted the check. We told her we do not want the sandwich or to be here for another second.  The trainee apologized and tried to be as accommodating as he could but what can a trainee do for us.  You would think our server would try to get us out of there fast since we were not so friendly at this point. Instead we had to ask another waiter to hunt her down so we can pay our bill (minus the sandwich) and get the heck out of there. My friend actually tried to tip our waiter but we had to stop her. Tip her for what....the horrible service and her attitude. Never going back to this place again and I hope others wont after reading this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=620,2.84,2.86,2.86,2.404,2.852

546,Vineet S.,"San Francisco, CA",583,21,,5.0,2012-05-01,"I've been thinking of reasons to not like BJ's of Glendale. I haven't any. So I read some other 1-star reviews, just to see what my fellow humans had to say. 1. Some 17 year old: ""I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza"". Why would you go to a comfort food/beer garden and order an amputated pizza? With a vegan crust? Why don't you just swallow the Sierra Club's website? No carbs there. Go hug a Yeti.  2. Half naked wannabe in front of an $8000 corvette (Kelly Blue Book Value): ""Go down the street to OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE..half the price..great service and almost half the price"".  Also, is it ""half the price"" or ""almost half the price""? I suppose being naked in front of a 4-figure car complicates decision making.  Seriously, I can imagine a conversation with this specimen to go like: ""Oh my GAWDI just HATE Seattle!"" ""You're in San Francisco"" ""Whatever... Same longitude"" ""That's.. Surprisingly accurate! Do you even know what a longitude is?"" ""Duh... It's the opposite of shortitude."" These two aside, it would seem that most complaints come from not-so-stellar service found on Friday and Saturday nights. Because everyone comes here. All the time.  However, I frequent this establishment every 8-10 weeks, and I've ALWAYS had a great time. Every time. We've had two birthdays here of parties of 12 and 6; been here during happy hour and regular hours; sampled nearly half the menu in some form of the other; service has been great but not stellar; and we never had trouble with parking. I won't get into details about the menu - just don't order random weird stuff. Their pizzas and appetizers won't disappoint. Â Entrees are fine, too. Desserts are worth saving some real estate in the tummy for.  I'm not a beer aficionado, but my bros order for me and their draughts are always crisp and aptly chilled. I haven't any complaints.

So, we walk in and it's not busy at all (except for the bar where a soccer game is on). Our waiter comes right over and asks if we are ready to order our drinks and food. Whoa buddy, although I appreciate the enthusiasm, we literally just sat down, can you give us a minute to view the menu? Here's where it all went downhill. FRY-GATE. We ordered our entrees, along with a side of thin fries. Impossible to screw that up right? Wrong. Their first attempt came out cold and NOTE TO BJ's: shoestring fries should be somewhat crispy, not like soggy actual shoe stings. Next attempt: Still not hot and still soggy as hell. So fed up, we ask to try the thick fries. Next attempt: As I type this I'm still waiting, because they never came. Our food arrives... Mine was the chicken quesadilla which was ok -- stingy on the chicken and cheese and was not really filling at all. We tell our waiter that the fries never came and he goes to check on them... Instead of coming back with the fries, he asks us if the manager came by... All 3 of us say in disgusted unison: ""No"". Off he goes to get the manager.... The manager never comes... Instead our waiter asks if we'd like a pizookie. Since we are still eating and since we are pissed and waiting on a manager who would never come, we assumed that the manager didn't want to deal with the situation, so he authorized this peace offering, which we accepted. Lo and behold when the bill comes, we are charged for the pizookie!! Wtf! We see the manager across the room and try to wave him down. He ignores us. Meanwhile, we just want our check so we can get the hell out of there, but now our waiter is M.I.A... Naturally! After about 10 minutes we see him with his only other table and flag him down...10 more minutes for him to charge the cards and bring them back.

Well lets see from the picture they offered in their menu (I do understand it is in the low calorie area - but come on) it rarely looked anything like it. Plus I was still indecisive but I did want the mahi mahi, I just didn't like what was in the rice. And I was craving something seafood since lame Vegas Seafood Buffet had one heck of a super duper long wait. So I sucked it up and got. Once we got our main entree I was like yay and than I saw it. I was very disappointed. The mahi mahi was a bit fine a lil unflavored but it was passable. Below that contained more of red peppers, onions, I think its cabbage, Â as for peas - it said it had snow peas which I didn't see any, few pineapple and like a dash of rice. I posted up a picture but I forgot to take it before I ate it lol but anyway thats how my food was. I also drop the rate of it being a 4 because it wasn't so flavorful. As for appetizers - no calamari this time so we got spinach & artichoke dip and boneless wings. The boneless wings were good I guess because it had bbq sauce but tasted something you would like at a fast food joint. I love the spinach and artichoke but they don't give enough spinach and artichoke to consume that many tortilla chips.

Meyer, in Santa Monica Bay headed toward Catalina all bets are off, but we'll be visiting an actual brewery instead. PARKING IN STRUCTURE: 3/5 Stars. Â 2 hours free with validation, but you will lose at least a half hour driving up to the roof when you arrive and back down when you leave. Â Yes, you may see a couple spots, but they're only big enough for a motorcycle. LOCATION: 5/5 Stars. Â Northwest corner of Broadway and Brand Blvd. in the middle of Â Downtown Glendale, California, not to be confused with Glendale, Arizona. Â  It is across the street from Â The Glendale Galleria, so for us shopaholics that is a really good thing. Â In addition, Bloomingdales will be opening right across the street in a few months. Â Yay!!!! Â The Americana at Brand is just a couple blocks south on Brand Boulevard. In conclusion, this is a chain and while it is not unique it is still pretty good as far as food goes. Â  Definitely come here instead of eating in the stinky Food Park at the Galleria. Â  P.S. Â A newer BJ's Restaurant will be opening in Old Town Pasadena in the next year in this really historic looking building. Â I can just tell this new one is going to blow the rest out of the water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240,2.92,2.87,2.87,2.16,2.8899999999999997

Â Love their food, and when the Glendale location opened, I was excited that they followed me from Newport Beach to Burbank and then to Glendale. Â I come here fairly often (and plan on going on Sunday, actually) as the pizza is very addictive. Â I like where the Glendale location is though now that I've moved out of downtown Glendale, I'll have to find parking instead of just walking, but I hear that's not too bad. Â The look of the place is awesome except for one thing. Â I HATE all the TVs. Â Either go with a classy look, or go with a sports bar look. Â Combining the two looks silly. Â Keep the TV's in the bar area, I know from working at BJs that they get good crowds to watch the game and in the Burbank location that made sense as the restaurant is more sports-bar looking. Â This location could be more of a classy look to it without TV's every 3 feet apart. Â Favorite pizzas? Â All of them. Â LOVE the pizzookie. Â Probably my all-time favorite dessert.

Â The last time I was here was about several years ago so I could not recall if the food was good or not. Â  When we got there, the place was not overly full so we were seated promptly. Â Our server was friendly and took our orders. Â We started off with three appetizers which were shrimp in lettuce wrap, flat bread pizza, and fried calamari. Â For drinks it was orange juice, pumpkin beer, and cola. Â The cola was flat and had no fizz. Â The pumpkin beer tasted awful. Â Orange juice tasted watered down. Â We complained about the cola and orange juice to our server.. Â The cola was replaced and it was better. Â As for the orange juice, our server told us that other customers had complained about the same thing. Â Our server told us that the orange juice they use is for mixing cocktails and not for drinking straight. Â This made no sense to us. Â If you know this, why would you keep serving people watered-down orange juice? Â I was given a choice of a substitute or a refund so I chose cranberry juice. Â I asked our server if the cranberry juice was going to be the real thing and she kind of rolled her eyes and told us yes. Â She brought the cranberry juice. Â I tasted it and it was the genuine thing. I would rate our appetizers as being poor to good. Â The good was shrimp in lettuce wrap. Â In fact, this was the best of all the food that night. Â The fried calamari tasted like cardboard. Â The flatbread pizza was only decent because it had too much oil.causing the bread to be soggy. Â  We also ordered two entrees which were shrimp and sausage jumbalaya and shrimp scampi. Â The shrimp scampi was not that good. Â There was too much breading or what seemed like it. Â Maybe the breading was actually parmesan cheese. Â Whatever the case, it did not taste good. Â The jumbalaya was actually pretty OK except it was too salty and the sausage were too thin.

I ordered this with Â a side of strawberry sauce (the stuff they use for the beignets). Obviously, this is ooey gooey deliciousness. But, oh, wait! I didn't receive that exact order! UGH.

It never came, so I decided to just eat the damn melted pizookie. THEN...I am like, ""WTF, this is chocolate chip. Or is it? Maybe the C&C just looks exactly like the chocolate chip one.""

366,Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3716.0,2.0,2013-01-15,"I normally like BJ's such as the former Chicago Bulls player BJ Armstrong, the music of Bon Jovi and sometimes Billy Joel depending on my mood, and of course the real reason why all guys ""get up"" in the morning.  Sadly, unlike the ""awesome BJs"" mentioned above, I can't say that I like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse because every time I go to their chain restaurants I get the same shitty service. It appears that BJ's has a universal policy for ""suckage"" and it's obvious that they must not share tips because none of the waiting staff look out for one another. I mean why is it ""so hard"" to get some damn water? I really wish they had those buttons that Korean restaurants have because having to flag someone down for water while ""choking"" on pizza is not fun.  Also, I don't like how Happy Hour (HH) at BJ's only applies to the bar area and not the regular booths and tables. ""Deep inside"" I wished that we had gone to Yardhouse instead because at least at Yardhouse, HH extends to the entire restaurant and they have a much better beer selection with a more professional staff that actually knows what the hell the beer they are serving tastes like. For example, when we were seated at our booth I asked our server what the guest tap Magic Hat tasted like since there was no flavor profile summary on the menu. This was met by ummm let me just get you a sample instead of any attempt at a description. When I did taste the sample, Magic Hat reminded me of nasty ass cough syrup. Thank god I settled for Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA ($6-something).  Food-wise the wife and I ended up ordering the avocado eggroll thing and a medium-sized chicken bacon pizza. The avocado egg roll ($10- something) was ""way too thick"" because it consisted of a blend of avocados and cream cheese that was so heavy that it felt like it was getting stuck ""deep in the back of my throat"". The chicken bacon ranch pizza ($20- something) consisted of chicken with bacon, cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes, and ""globs of white stuff"" that I believed to be ranch that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Taste-wise it was okay, but it was nothing ""orgasmic"". In fact, I think that for the price, the new handmade pan pizzas at Domino's taste lightyears better for a fraction of the cost. I hate restaurants where plates are not washed properly like the plates that were brought to our table, since finding other people's particles (OPP) of food on plates is disgusting. Also, it's exasperating when I need to look specifically for my server to get a glass of water because other servers are not in charge of our booth. And lastly, I especially get irked when it becomes an ordeal just to pay and get the fuck out.  In the end it's obvious that the BJ in BJ's must stand for Bad Job because their food and service quite frankly ""blows"". That could be why there is always someone training someone because of the high turnover. And I guess I'm not down with ""OPP""! Oh yea, and despite the 2-hour free validated parking, the parking structure has blind turns and it doesn't help that it's filled with speeding assholes.

Â We arrived at around 3:30pm and, not surprisingly, the place was rather empty. Â We get seated quickly, met with a waitress quickly and order quickly. Â Everything is off to a great start. Â Sad thing is is went all downhill from there. We ordered an appetizer, took about 10 minutes to come. Â Not bad. Â We ordered 2 pasta entree's, that took another 20 minutes. Â Kind of long, but I will forgive them because I was watching the game. Â Girlfriend bites into her pasta, stone cold. Â I bite into mine, pipping hot. Â Basically this means they made hers immediately after ordering and it sat there for a good amount of time. Â We grab out waitress and ask them to reheat it. Â I finish my entire meal before it comes back. Â  At this point we have been in the restaurant about an hour and we, regrettably, order a Pazzookie. Â For those who don't know what that is, its this ungodly amazing dessert where they serve an under cooked cookie in a pan covered in melting Ice Cream. Â This is where something very peculiar happens. Â Earlier a different waiter than the one we ordered from brought our food to the wrong table. Â I note this because 10 minutes after our dessert order the same waiter brings a single small Pazzokie to the table behind us and they say they didn't order it. Â He acts surprised and says you must have gotten a free dessert. Â They said thank you and he went on his way. Â  15, 20, 25 minutes go by, no dessert. Â Then all of a sudden a third person comes to our table and says he was sent over to see if we needed anything else. Â He acted like we had been sitting their too long and we were an annoyance to him. Â Let me note the place was still only about half full. Â  To stop this review from becoming a book, the service was horrible. Â Other than our actual waitress, every one was rather rude.

Was here with a friend about a week ago for lunch, there was one holiday party or some kind of party and the rest of the restaurant wasn't full. Our waiter was some guy with gold sparkly glasses and who did not wear an undershirt under his thin white dress shirt. He was by far the worst waiter I've had in a while, we waited 45 mins and no food came out, we couldn't find him anywhere so we had to flag down a different waitress. She found him and he came with some lame excuse about not knowing what happened to our food. Funny thing is that there was a table behind us that was seated after us and they got their food way before us. After his lame excuse our food came out 20 mins later, like a though he just put it in. Every time I gone to this BJ's I have had crap service, I'm not sure whats going on here but their service sucks and I don't think management cares because I have never seen a manager walking around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=560,2.88,2.57,2.788,3.2720000000000002,2.694
206,Tu-Anh N.,"Oakland, CA",918,461,3553.0,5.0,2014-01-01,"Hands down the best BJ's experience I had! Â And I owe I all to Latanya (Tanya). Â  Her service was over the top stellar and this was on a super busy new year eve night!although she was swamped she had such a positive and enthusiastic energy! Â  As soon as we sat down she immediately told us she will get to us. Â When she did as promised she told us all her recommendations on beer, appetizer, pizza and entree. Â It's always nice to hear those. I ordered some water with no ice. Â Tanya came back with my water with no ice AND a bowl of lemon wedges, something I forgot to ask! Â She also came back with a sampling of soups: clam chowder, tomato bisque, and chicken tortilla. Â Sweet! I wanted to have a drink since it was new year eve! Â Tanya gave us her recommendations and brought me out 3 samples of beer...woot! Unfortunately I had already planned on a cocktail and decided to get a: WHITE PEACH MARGARITA - $9.25 This drink was very sweet but since it was served over ice in a tall glass, I figure I can take my time on the drink and let the ice dilute it a but. Â The sugar rim was nice but unnecessary since the drink was already so sweet. Â I appreciated the peach garnish and then noticed more sliced on the bottom! Â When I took a bite into though I instantly got a brain freeze, forgetting that this peach slice has been sitting in a pool of ice! Haha! Â I ended up not finishing this drink because even about 2 hours my margarita was still too sweet and I was not in a mood for a sugar headache later. We decided to go for the holiday special where we get 2 appetizers (salad or soup), 2 entrees from a selected list, and a pizzookie for $35. Â Here's what we chose: HOUSE SALAD it's one of those dishes that will make you feel less guilty when you main entree that is a burger comes out. In reality, this salad holds no nutrients. Â Maybe there are some in the shredded carrots, but all this plate hold was lettuce and purple cabbage and ranch sauce...which is quite unhealthy, haha. Â Oh there are tomatoes, too. Â Yeah don't get a house salad. Â Cesar salad is probably no better. TOMATO BASIL BISQUE Because of that soup sampling we had I chose this and it delightful! It was tangy enough, salty enough with that nice sweetness of tomatoes and that richness taste we know from creamy tomato soup! I loved it! Â I should have gotten 2 of these instead of that house salad. BALSAMIC-GLAZED CHICKEN Our marinated chicken breast grilled and served over baby field greens, caramelized onions and white cheddar mashed potatoes and drizzled with sweet balsamic glaze. I went straight to the mashed potatoes! Â I loved how the white cheddar made it rich an creamy! Â It complimented the balsamic glazed chicken so well! Â The onions was like the icing on the cake! Â I'm not usually a fan of grilled chicken breast because it always comes out dry to me. Â But the glaze and mashed potatoes helped. Â Oh and the greens was way better than the house salad haha. FRESH ATLANTIC SALMON - Blackened Flavorful fresh salmon fillet either flame-broiled or blackened. Served with rice pilaf and vegetables. Tanya gave us 2 options on how wed like this to be cooked: blackened, New Orleans style with spices but not spicy, or just grilled, which she says is still good. Â After elaborately explaining to us how blackened is and that she is from New Orleans, we went with that one! We were so pleased we did! Â The fish was amazing! Â The butter sauce complimented it well and I love sauces. Â The fish was NOT dry and that's a common reason why I never order fish at a western restaurant, but I am glad I did this time! PIZOOKIE - CHOCOLATE CHIP I Requested the vanilla bean ice cream be served on the side instead of on top, that way I can take home the rest of the cookie I don't finish! Â The cookie is always perfect to me: warm, GOOEY, and half raw! Â Always plenty if chocolate chips! Â The ice cream was yummy too but I was too full to finish it. I enjoyed the dinner for the most part but the reason why I am giving my 5 stars was because Tanya! Â She made me laugh so much! Â She clearly hardworking, enthusiastic, I love how friendly she is and is Â so charming! Â I've been to various BJs many times and this was my favorite visit! Thank you BJ and big BIG thanks to Tanya! Â I am definitely coming back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=200,3.0,2.57,2.8,3.604,2.742

We placed a take out order using their mobile app. because we felt like having their nachos, barbecue ranch salad, and avocado egg-rolls.  We discovered the nachos had recently been canned from the menu so when we called to cancel, the guy said he will do the nachos. Fast forward $40: Nachos: Portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small. There was hardly any cheese, no sour cream or guacamole, just a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and chopped tomatoes, some weird sauce, and that's pretty much it folks. Now that I recall, I got better nachos at Taco Bell for god's sake.  Salad: Again portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small to the point that it looked like a $5 side salad. Straw that broke the camels back was that they used iceberg lettuce....WOW. Charging more than $12 for a side salad and you couldn't use Romaine.  Avocado Rolls: They were pretty good considering the other stuff hence the reason they get an extra star.

Although the food is decent I'd never pick to go unless my friends insisted or I'm held hostage :) Paying for a salad that's over 1,000 calories or a sandwich that's more than 1,500 calories or so is not really ideal for me but hey that's just me. They are great though for happy hours and drinks. And of course...  drum rolls please... their PAZOOKIES! If you have not had this or know what it is you are missing out on life. A giant warm baked cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream. It's every fat person in ourselves dream along with the smokers with their munchies or anyone who loves dessert!! I recommend half chocolate chip and oreo or peanut butter! And you get a free one if it's your birthday (although I believe it's a smaller size). _Chicken Â Lettuce Wraps. This was good and somewhat on the healthier side. But nothing special. I just got this because it was one of the lightest on their menu and my friend said it was good so I tried it out. Pretty tasty and refreshing a nice appetizer to share. _Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. This was pretty good. Comes in 6 bite sized mushrooms, filled with spinach, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, then sprinkled with crispy bread crumbs and drizzled with lemon pesto sauce. The mushroom was moist and warm, a great appetizer to share! _California Club Flatbread. This was great! The flat bread was thin crusted, which I love. Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Very light and not too cheesy or heavy. A little on the salty side. Great to share as well or have as your main dish.  _Barbecued Bison Burger. Lean, ground buffalo, topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. Served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. This was just okay. Although Bison drew my attention the food was quite an opposite reaction. Was not a big fan of the bison patty seasoning. It was a bit bland. The slaw was boring and had barely any dressing.  Overall the food is decent and they offer a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers etc to fit anyone's need.

Â The flight that my wife received was well priced, but the servers messed up the order of which beer was which when they brought them out. They don't bring them out on a paddle, so there's no organization. They were out of the beer I ordered, and also the second beer I ordered, so I ended up getting a foreign beer, which I really enjoyed. They do have a good selection if Belgians in bottles. The BJ's beers were just ok, nothing to write home about. The food menu had some good options. We got a pizza which was really good but pricey for a 15 dollar small. We also got two apps which were cheap, and tasty.  When my server brought out my bill, they had charged me for both the beers they were out of, which just added to the frustration.

Â I always have great service & if ever there's an issue, Â it is always taken care of. Â  A few weeks ago, we (6 co-workers) went there for lunch and had a perfect example of poor and in adequate service. Â We were seated immediately as there was very few tables in use. Â We have a 1 hour lunch breae & we showed up at work 2 1/2 hours later! Â  It took 45 minutes to get our food and still some orders were incorrect & incomplete. Â When the servers brought out our food and we brought the errors to their attention, Â their responses were always let me get your waitress. Â Our waitress wouls always come....about 10 minutes later. Â When we told her what was wrong, she would just acknowledge by saying okay. Â Eventually the items came out. Â  This was not the end of it. Â When the bill came, we all looked at the price of our individual meals and pitched in an extra $ 2 for tax and tip (cash & credit card). The waitress came back saying that she did not charge anything yet because we were still approximately $60 short. Â We were astonished and could not understand why but just for the sake of getting out, a few of us put additional money in to cover the cost difference. Â At that point, we really started to review the bill we noticed there was additional items that did not belong to us. We informed the waitress of this discovery and her response was: Â oh I see what I did. Â I'll get that corrected. Â She came back with a new receipt & removed our drinks for the error. Â She came back with the corrected bill, the credit card receipts and then questioned the additional $27. Â She actually had the nerve to ask if the remaining balance was her tip. Â At that point we were just waiting for a simple apology on her part and it never came. I can only hope that this waitress was new & did not know what she was doing. However, that was not the case.

409,Nicole M.,"Glendale, CA",386,194,1266.0,1.0,2015-04-17,"So I went to BJ's last week and the week before and had issues with the staff during both visits.  Saturday- April 4th, 2015 around 7pm My waitress Elisa H. had the worst attitude for no apparent reason. The minute we took our seats she took a really nasty demeanor with us. When we sat down my friend was ready to order her salad, as an appetizer, and I wasn't ready to order, but I didn't care if her salad came out first, but to Elisa it was a big deal. I let her attitude slide thinking maybe I was making something out of nothing, but as our dinner proceeded I could no longer stand her attitude. I get that maybe she was having a bad day or maybe she was upset about having to work on a Saturday night, but there's no need to treat your customers poorly because of it. It's like she wanted us to leave the restaurant. My friend and I wanted dessert after dinner but she didn't even ask us and instead tossed the check on the table while we were still eating. Usually waiters ask if you want to see the dessert menu, good thing we both knew we wanted pizzokies so we let her know, but you could tell that she was annoyed because we weren't leaving. Isn't the staff supposed to want you to order more? That means you'll get a bigger tip!!  Sunday- April 12th around 12am So my friends and I came to get pizookies (yes, I love them), and we were glad that BJ's closes late. We ordered a trio and when we got our pizookies they were extremely undercooked. At first we thought it was because we had ordered one gluten free cookie, but nope all of our pizookies were grainy. It was like we were eating melted cookie dough (food poisoning alert!) We let our waitress Karla M. know about our issue and she didn't seem to like what we were telling her, so she went to get her manager. The manager (unfortunately, I didn't get his name) walks in and immediately takes an attitude with us saying that we're wrong and that pizookies are supposed to taste like that. We asked him if he wanted to take a bite but he declined as he is a diabetic. I repeatedly let him know that I'm a pizookie expert, and had just had one the week before, but he wasn't buying it. After going back and forth about our pizookie problem he reluctantly took them back and put in a new order for us. I really don't know why it was so hard for them to just take it back and bring us a new one without any rude questions or unnecessary remarks. It's like they thought we wanted a free pizookie or something. The thing cost around $9, and we only had one bite of each cookie, it's not like we had consumed the entire dessert! We called our waitress pretty quickly and addressed the problem, but they acted like we were thugs. I also don't know why we didn't get an apology. Aren't you supposed to make your customers happy, why make them feel like they're doing something wrong for speaking up.  I'm just really surprised by the nasty attitude that a majority of the staff has at this BJ's. I was even more shocked to see how rude and condescending the manager was. I guess the problem stems from management. I'm never stepping foot at this BJ's again. If it's not a problem with the staff, it's a problem with the food. Can't I just enjoy my pizookie in peace!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240,2.96,3.08,2.952,2.468,3.0320000000000005

At the beginning we had to wait, not because they were busy, but because our buzzer was not working. Then we placed an order (only 1 pasta and 1 french fries) and it took an exact half an hour for them to bring only the fries. After waiting another 10 minutes they brought the wrong pasta. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the correct one. Luckily the waitress was nice and she apologized for taking too long, saying that they have a big order and they were working on it. I understand the wait because they had an unusual situation, but that wasn't the only problem. The thin fries, which I usually order and love, looked and tasted really bad as if they fried it twice using rancid oil. When I told the waitress, she looked at it and said ""that looks nasty"". It really did. So they replaced it. Also the dishes were dirty (see picture). Plus we already ordered a piazookie (which we are addicted to), but by the time we had the correct pasta and the normal fries we realized that we were there for more than 2 hours so we had to cancel the piazookie order. When we got the bill they didn't charge for the piazookie but then they brought one anyway. I asked them to take it back since I'm not charged for that. What a disorder.

There was very little of the other ingredients, it was practically a giant ball of lettuce that looked like it was glued together. The chicken in the salad was bland and had no taste. My friend got the BJ's Brewhouse burger and she's lactose intolerant so she asked our waiter if there's any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no. Her burger comes and she eats half of it before she realizes something tastes off. We took her burger apart and saw that there was shredded melted cheese melted onto both of the buns. We specifically asked if there was any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no, it wasn't written on the menu either that there was shredded melted cheese on the bun.

Everything was delicious (plus with 2 HH orders 10 wings total for $8 can't beat that in LA) the wings were crispy and meaty. The avocado egg roll was yummy I don't love the sauce that comes with them I wish it was spicier and less sweet but that might just be me. Boyfriend had the pale ale it was great, Kat gave him a sample of their new IPA which they made in partnership with stone (I love stone) anyways it was an unexpectedly fantastic experience and all thanks to Kat .

I don't want to say it was bad because my server offered advice and suggested the happy hour menu which saves us both money.  We moved to the bar to take advantage of the reduced pricing. At that point it got weird because he didn't give us a happy hour menu. He returned to see what I wanted and I asked what the heck was on the menu. He said he didn't have Â one but could tell me. How do you NOT have the menu. Weird. He showed me the beers that are discounted but that was of no use to me. I had already ordered a lemonade. I thought, why did I move over to the bar?  So with the minimal info he gave I got the pepperoni flat bread and bbq wings. The food was great. This the 3 stars. But, why didn't we get any napkins or silverware?

Idk if that's best best way to greet a guest after having them wait. Anyways we were escorted to a booth table that was too small for our party. The restaurant was not busy as it usually is so our wait time seemed longer than it should have been. When the waiter finally asked us for our drinks he returned with all but 1 he had forgotten. As he later took our meals, he didn't right it down and ""memorized"" all our orders. My Cesar salad arrived first and the bowl was half way full. The lettuce was so old with black spots and croutons where stale. I asked for a fresher salad and the waiter was really nice about getting me a fresh salad. We also ordered the queso and salsa verde dip with chips which was amazing except for the chips included more chip crumbs than chips. The waiter again was nice enough to bring extra chips. First, someone came to drop a guacamole burger which none of us had order. The person was so angry when none of us claimed it because none of us had ordered that.

She returned with what she claimed was a second burger, she said she cut this burger herself to make sure it was cooked in the center. Turns out it was the same burger I cut, because I cut it again, and it was just as raw as before, lol. ""cut it yourself"", gimme a break.

100,Barclay W.,"Saint Paul, MN",354,901,4.0,2.0,2016-04-12,"I have a love hate with BJ's restaurant. The nice part about BJ's is that, much like every other big chain restaurant, the food is fairly consistent wherever you go. No matter where you are you know what to expect from the food at BJ's.  That isn't to say the food is amazing. The food is what you would also expect of a large chain. Good, but not as great. Their menu is too large to ensure that they can produce every meal at the highest quality. Still the quality isn't bad and you always know what you are going to get from them. In that sense I kind of love this place because when I am in doubt I know I can grab something decent here.  What I HATE about this place is the service. The service at this location is a joke, both for takeout and dine in. I've done many takeout orders from here because my work is right above here, so it is a favorite lunch meeting spot. Almost consistently I know that there won't be anyone at the to go counter to help me. I've waited 5+ minutes for someone to come out and help me. Other waiters and the host(ess) have seen me waiting and do not say anything. There is also a good chance that the food won't be ready or the order will be wrong somehow. It does not reflect well on me when I am late with the lunch because they couldn't get their service together.  When I have eaten here for lunch the service has been just as bad. This place is basically empty when I've come for lunch, yet the service moves as though they are slammed. This place is right below where I work, so it is quick to get here. Still it can take over an hour to eat and leave because the service is just that bad. Thankfully there is a way to pay with their app now, so you don't have to wait the 15 minutes for your server to get your check.  I know I'll keep coming back while I'm here because this place is convenient and the food is passable. For anyone looking for a quick bite, there is much better and faster options around.  33/100",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=120,3.48,3.4,3.28,3.0480000000000005,3.4320000000000004

We are usually understanding about our waiter/waitress having a bad day because we have worked at restaurants for years. I don't even think he was having a bad day because he was rather communicative and friendly with other tables. It started with him forgetting to bring us a diet pepsi. Then, my sister spilled her drink, it definitely made loud enough noise for everyone to hear; however, he was too busy chatting with his co-workers to notice it. Her napkin was completely wet, and he doesn't offer to give her a new one. He did bring her a new drink, though. He never checked to see how we were doing (we were there for an hour and a half) when my brother's 1/4 left diet pepsi looked like iced tea because he needed a refill 25 minutes ago. When we finally asked for a refill, he took 11 minutes to bring him a diet pepsi after we were done eating everything. He brougnt us our check even before we asked for our check or refill for my brother's diet coke. He never smiled when he had no problem laughing with his co workers, he unnecessarily circled the suggested tip amounts, as if my brother didn't know how much to tip.

The beers on tap were also a great complement to our food.  Our server was really nice to. Anyone who cards me deserves a gold star!  But the downside, and major downer it was, were the desserts. The monkey bread was good, but tasted something similar i made with Pillsbury crescent rolls! The beignets are New Orleans, French style donuts. Deep fried, tasty goodness.. usually. These were not even donuts, but a sourdough dinner roll dipped in sugar!! I was appalled! How can they call it something it's not! It's wasn't even a donut! I would've been happy with just a glazed donut, if they wanted to pass it off for a beignet, but seriously that was the worse excuse for a dessert, let alone the wrong definition of something it's trying to be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=380,3.64,3.47,3.276,3.152,3.5380000000000003
80,Helen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,217,164.0,3.0,2016-06-08,"I've been to this location a few times and I have to say as much as I love their pizza, I don't really like their service. I came here yesterday with my coworker for lunch around 2pm. The restaurant was not that busy, there were a few tables here and there but the restaurant definitely wasn't crowded. We got seated by this guy at the front who kept mumbling- we could not understand what he was saying.  Our server was this girl who had a nervous giggle. Whenever we wanted to order something or ask for water she would giggle- it was odd (because really, nothing was that funny). My friend got the California Club lunch and I got the Unlimited soup and salad combo. I got the chili because I wanted something hearty and the mozzarella and tomato salad. In about 10 minutes my friend got his sandwich special first. I saw there and stared at him for a few minutes while he ate his fries, since he's a gentleman he was waiting for me to get my food so he can devour his. Several more minutes pass by and now we are wondering why ladling premade chili and a cold salad would take longer than a hot sandwich?  Finally several minutes later our server appears with my food. I was tempted to order my next round at the moment since it obviously takes forever for them to get it out but I resisted. She never returned to check up on us after we started eating. I finally caught her again and asked for the Caesar salad, they actually did give a decent portion of the chili so I didn't bother trying another soup.  My friend wanted to order dessert- he got the caramel and sea salt pizookie and I got my Caesar salad (which most of it was limp romaine by the way). We were on a bit of a time crunch because we were on our lunch break so we started getting worried when his cookie didn't come out. We also couldn't find our server anywhere and mind you the restaurant WAS STILL NOT BUSY. We had to flag down a different server so we could ask them to tell our server for our check- she finally brought it out and we immediately gave her our cards to pay. We also scarfed down the cookie because we were running pretty late at that point. I gotta say, I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a quick lunch, they seem to take their sweet time and can't really say the service was all that great....too bad because I still love their pizzas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=100,3.56,3.45,3.284,3.0520000000000005,3.494
372,Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2016-06-08,"Yesterday I had the worst BJ's experience and I just wanted to share. I ordered a caesar salad and the lettuce was wilted and dark and looked awful. Even the chicken had blood spots and fat coming off of the pieces. When the waiter came back I had moved all the gross-looking salad pieces to the top so he could see why I was unhappy with my salad. I then asked for a different salad instead. He made a fuss and seemed very annoyed. When he brought me my new salad, I noticed that they simply put other salad ingredients on top of my old salad rather than bringing me a new one. At this point though, I was very hungry and preferred not to make a fuss by speaking to the manager or getting further involved in the matter. It doesn't stop there, however. After our less-than-great meal, we ordered a pizooki to-go. After we got to our car and opened the pizooki box, I was extremely disappointed to see that our pizooki looked like someone had eaten half of it before giving it to us. It was very flat and did not even fill out the circular box. It was not even in the shape of a circle! It looked like someone ate it before us. I have attached a picture of the pizooki we received for reference. This picture was taken before we even started eating the cookie. I am very disappointed with the service we received, and also pretty surprised.

I dont know why but I was on a mission one recent Friday night and I just had to make my way to BJ's to have one. Good thing it closes late because we got there around 9/930pm. The place was busy as you would expect on a Friday night. We waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. We were given one of the elevated big booths which in retrospect didnt make sense, as we passed several open tables for 2 on the way to the booth. Oh well, we went with it.  Since we were on a mission for a pizookie we only ordered a couple of appetizers so we wouldnt get too full to enjoy dessert. We ordered the calamari appetizer that came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping. I prefer cocktail sauce when eating calamari but sadly theirs was bland. It really lacked flavor. I didnt know why. The calamari was just ok. It wasnt the worst calamari I had but it certainly wasnt the best. I think the calamari could have been fresher. We also ordered the burger sliders app with crispy french fries. This was tasty as the sliders (2 with cheese; 2 without) were really good even though the burger patties were on the thin side. It was still real tasty though and the bread was good. The crispy french fries were great and went perfect with a little bit of ketchup. I would def order that again. The pizookie was GLORIOUS. It was better than I remembered it to be. We got the OG chocolate chunk with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was so good. The cookie still warm and soft went so well with a dollop of that delicious vanilla ice cream. Such a perfect dessert. Definitely needs to be shared by 2-3 people... Craving satisfied. Expectations exceeded. Service was ok. My empty water glass was sitting there for a while. I even put it at the end of the table which is usually the universal sign of ""fill me please"". We had to flag our waiter down to finally fill it. Another complaint I have was we used a Yelp check-in offer for a free pizookie with $10 spent on food. When we orginally got the check, the pizookie was on the bill. We had to remind our waiter about the supposed free pizookie and he made the adjustment to the bill and removed it. Glad he did but it should have been noted from the start that we had a free one that night. Anyway, those are the only things that come to mind service wise. Our waiter was friendly but just not as attentive as we would expect or prefer. Parking is in a pay parking structure.

I ordered the ribeye steak with a side of chili and pilaf. The entire meal, and I mean the entire meal, was like warm at best. When the chili was brought out, it was getting close to being a gazpacho. I asked the server to please reheat the chili and I never saw that bowl of chili again. Â Almost sounds like a song. Then came the main course and that was not even quite like warm. I ordered a ribeye medium well and it was almost rare. The rice pilaf was awful and not even warm either.

401,Tee N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,4.0,1.0,2017-01-22,Came out on a Saturday night to have our belated Christmas dinner. It was 8 of us. I'm not going to go on and on about how horrible it was because in reality the company we were in mattered more than the disastrous dinner. I will just mention the highlights. Service was ok but things were forgotten and we had to wait. Food was brought without utensils. Upon arrival of the burgers my heart sank. I have NeVER seen a less appetizing burger in my life. No juice at all just dry and stale pieces of meAt. My friends burger looked like someone had taken a bite out of the meat so before the guy who brought it out left she asked if the burger was supposed to look like that. In shock he said no and took it back to the kitchen but by then the damage was done. She didn't want the burger anymore and cancelled it. My husband ordered his with cheese and it came with none. The appetizers we paid a WHOPPING $18 for were so ridiculous. Â We all work in the food industry so we were just in shock at the shit you can put out there and call it food. The list goes on and on but I'm not a book writer. I just wanted to say my peace about it. The positives were the drinks and pizzokie. Like I said the company we were in made up for everything. And we genuinely enjoyed ourselves. We were just disappointed that we had to pay for such poor food and service. Next year we won't make the same mistake. Thank you for showing your true colors BJ's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240,2.88,3.26,3.256,2.372,3.108

We decided to park a little further away ( a few blocks) set the meter for 1:45 mins. We arrived at Bj's; I had to use the restroom prior to sitting. Both sinks faucets were on & one of the sinks was almost over-flowing! I tried turning them both off ( after I washed up of course) neither one would completely shut off. As I left the restroom, I approached one of the servers ( sitting on a bar stool @ the bar) & told her about the issue!  The restaurant didn't seem to busy, but our server Racheal; we noticed had quite a few tables in her area. However, ""all in all"" the restaurant during that time wasn't crowded by any means. In fact, we also noticed one of the chefs was either on his lunch break or off work as he was seating in a booth on the computer while we dined. Ordered our drinks when Racheal came to greet us. My daughter & myself got the Mango Lemongrass tea, my husband got the Sunset Peach Fusion $2.95 each. Neither seemed to be that ""spectacular in flavor"" for the price. We got our drinks fairly quick, although when asking for sugar that took a bit! We ordered a Large Caesar salad to split & a bowl of clam chowder. Our main Entree was a large pizza. In looking at the receipt (after), it also stated that the soup was a main entree? Ok!! Anyway, the food took some time to arrive.  The salad was presented first, that was good. The soup arrived with the pizza & was less than luke warm & less than satisfactory! The serving size very disappointing for $6.75 ! No complaints on the pizza!  Our daughter had the kids meal & for the price /portion, the best deal of the day! $6.25 that was less than what they charged ($6.75) for that lousy soup..

Then, I tried to arrange with our server to get the free birthday pizookies as a surprise, and for the flavors to correspond to whatever the birthday people picked off the menu.

Then I came to the BJ's in Glendale and it kinda all went out the window. Check-in was quick. We were initially told 30-40 minutes but we were seated in about 15. When the hostess called our name, she grabbed 2 menus, and led us to our table. She put the menus on the table and walked away. No words the whole time...I don't expect a full conversation but not even a, ""Welcome!"", ""How are you today?"", ""Enjoy your meal!"", or even better, ""Your server will be right with you."" She just walked away. And it was awkward.  We sat for about 10 minutes before our server came over. There was a game on and so I understand it's busy, but just like the hostess, this guy was not great with words. Very dry and expressionless. The food was just okay. Didn't really have too much flavor...seems like it's all a re-heat job in the back and it made me sad because I don't remember BJ's being like this. Our server never asked if the food came out okay, didn't offer any extra condiments - nothing.

Last Thursday, we had a business meeting and couldn't agree on a spot so we all opted for BJ's as the safest bet. The two hosts were friendly enough and sat us at a booth near the bar. From what I remembered, there used to be a lot more TV screens everywhere but I've never been a fan of that unless it's a sports bar and you don't mind being distracted  from every angle while you're trying to focus on your food. Our waitress was nice enough. We ordered a mini Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza, Root Beer Ribs and Chicken Tacos. The Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza was prepared to perfection, it was warm and fluffy and had a fine balance of flavors. The Ribs barely had any meat on them and left an extra sweet aftertaste that made me feel a bit nauseous. Do not expect to be full after these ribs. I didn't have the chicken taco, but my friend was raving about them. Again, they didn't look like they would fill you up. That point was proven when  my buddy said he was starving just a few hours later. PROS - Validated parking - Friendly staff CONS - Inconsistencies in new foods on the menu.

However, when it FINALLY arrive (about forty minutes after I placed the order) the pizza was not even slightly warm. I'm not exaggerating. There was NO warmth to the pizza, not even in the center. I don't know how long it had sat out, but the pizza was stone-cold. I started to just eat it...after all, there are worse things in life than cold pizza. For whatever reason, I decided to complain (which is not something I normally do. I could count on one hand the number of times I've sent food back to the kitchen). Once I finally got the server's attention, he carried the pizza back to the kitchen and ran it through the oven again. When he brought the pizza back, the edges and bottom were burned...and the pizza was only lukewarm.  He offered to have a new pizza made, but by this time the rest of my party had finished their entrees. I just ate what I could, and left. It wasn't fair to expect my date to sit there waiting for another pizza to cook.  I probably wouldn't be making a big deal about this if it was the first time it has happened to me there.

Maybe because its all the same company, no one will care, but I will go on record for those who actually spend their money to expect more from what I this particular location offers.  Let me paint the picture if I may: Its a Tuesday (yesterday) and I walk in behind a 3 people in a group. Behind my party of 2 is 2 other parties. One party of 2 and another party of 1.  We all stand in the lobby waiting for someone to come greet us. Â No one around. We all stood there for several minutes before one guy behind me proceeded to the table area to find someone who could seat the parties.  The young lady comes to the front with a look on her face like WE were bothering her. Like she was just there to get a check and did not feel like seating anyone. With no eye contact, she proceeds to tell each party that the wait would be five minutes. Now I must add that from a human perspective, its hard to believe that its going to take ANY time to seat these parties because you could see approximately 12 tables with no one seated. I mean, it looked empty. Â But whatever. Now mind you, the couple behind me was a party of 2, but for some reason, whatever it may be, the young lady sat them before us. Why? I dont know, but I felt like that was kinda rude considering we were first. But whatever. Our server did his job....The first time. Not the second...or third. What do I mean? I mean he literally took our order and we never saw him again. Someone else brought our food and he never stopped by to check on our table. NOT ONCE. No water refills. No ""Is the food ok?"" Nothing. But again, for some reason, he made it a point to stop at the table behind us twice during their meal. Did I stink? Because I swore I was clean.  The ribeye was prepared properly. The broccoli looked like baby broccoli. The creamed corn was probably the best of the meal next to the one glass of strawberry lemonade that I had.  As I went to the bathroom, I overheard one guy at another table say ""he had been waiting over 10 mins and no service...WTF?"" But what was interesting was as I continued my walk to the bathroom, I saw 3 servers standing near a POS machine talking and laughing and another server in awe of the NBA highlights on the screen. yea...4 people, not doing their job.

I have been coming to BJs for over 10 years but that time is over.  I would have given one star but the waiter was really friendly.

When the food got to our table, at first glance I could tell the food was reheated maybe or not prepared fresh but I was hungry so I dug in. I look through the pasta to see how much shrimp is in it and no lie there were literally 5 pieces of shrimp. I wish I took a picture. And not to mention, it tasted like Stouffers. I sent the pasta back and got a baked potato. Nothing else looked appealing on the menu except for the pizza. My husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which it too tasted low quality, and had no flavor. The texture was just off and it was not fresh. The broccoli that came with it tasted like they opened a bag and threw it in a microwave. We also ordered calamari which was really good, thank God. I happened to look at the website while eating and saw a free appetizer deal which of course the waiter didn't mention. I was also able to use my Bjs rewards and for another $10 off.

Went in, ordered chips and guacamole as an app, and it literally took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to bring it out. On top of that, the food we had ordered was completely cold and digesting by the time it got to our table. I asked the waitress what he reason was and she said we wanted to bring it all out at once. Luckily, the manager is a nice guy and did a good job of helping us out and getting some fresh food on the table. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the manager was great, other than that horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=180,2.44,2.75,3.18,2.44,2.6260000000000003

Getting refills took a really long time and getting her attention took a while since she was always gone. I would give her 3 stars. Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: tasted good. The only thing I would change is how tart it is. All the textures worked really well and everything was cooked just right. Like I said, there was a tartness to the dish I wish was not so tart.  Churros: AMAZING! Great idea! It's basically a plate full of tiny churros and ice cream on top. The churros were cooked fresh and perfectly crisp. Define a great change from the -sometimes , too sweet, pizzookie! Price: I thought the price was slightly overpriced, but it's what I expected from a chain/ corporate restaurant. However, the food was acceptable, so no major complaints.  I took two stars away because for the price they charge and being a corporate restaurant, I think they should have servers who can actually attend to their guest.

We asked the server for a few more minutes, but we didn't get our order in until maybe 10 minutes later and after this family behind us got their order in before us. Our food finally got to our table and I was quite pleased with the Peruvian Quino Bowl with Shrimp that I got. It was a good sized portion and very filling. Our server didn't check up on us often, so it took a while to get a water refill and to put our order of pizookie in for dessert. We eventually got our order in for a white chocolate macadamia pizookie to share and I was excited when it came to our table. It was a warm delicious cookie with two scoops of ice cream on top.

55,Ryan H.,"Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,1.0,1.0,2017-07-20,"Last night was the last time I go to the Glendale location. When my wife and I arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  After waiting 30 minutes and noticing multiple open tables and multiple parties leaving, we asked why we hadn't been seated yet? We were then told 10 more minutes.  Once we sat down it took about 10 minutes for our server to come and ask for drinks. By this time we knew what we wanted to eat. Keep in mind the restaurant was not busy as there were 10-12 available tables just in our section.  I asked for cheese on my burger and got it without cheese, so the wait to eat was extended. At this rate we had been there for an hour.  A different server brought our food out, didn't ask if we wanted any condiments and just left. I tried to make eye contact with our server from a distance, once she saw our food had come out she turned in a different direction and didn't even bother to come and see if all was ok.  Our server approached the table next to us. At this point I was able to get her attention and ask for ketchup and ranch. We asked for two ranch sauces and got one. We asked for the second one and got it 10 minutes later.  After requesting for the check and providing my debt card we sat there for 10 minutes before our server took care of the bill.  While waiting for our server to take care of the bill Â a party sitting next to us began to complain about the service. One person in a sarcastic voice said we got out napkins I'm sure it will take 30 minutes before we get out drinks. Overall it took us over 2 hours to eat and leave on a Wednesday night. I've gotten faster service on a weekend at different restaurants. What a joke.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT AT THE GLENDALE LOCATION. TERRIBLE SERVICE.

I've heard service is very slow at this one, but me and a group of 6 came in and gave it a shot. Normally I get the Great White pizza, but this time I wanted wings! We ordered, server was awesome and everything was great.  45 minutes in and we asked about our food and someone comes and hands only 2 of the hamburgers down (4 meals still not there). One is fine, and one is completely cold. Like clearly very old. So we politely asked to get it warmed up or remade and thought it was no problem. About 5 minutes later, the burger that was sent back came out and was COLD AGAIN and my boneless wings came and as per usual, I always use a knife and fork. I know, I'm weird.... but thank God I did. When I cut into it, it was completely RAW. Like not a little raw, I mean it hadn't even touched the fryer - RAW. It looked like it was tossed in batter and coated with sauce and plated, no sign of being cooked whatsoever.  I have never been so shocked at a restaurant. We couldn't believe it! I didn't even think to take a picture as I was just staring at a raw piece of chicken. What's even worse is I thought maybe it was just one of the wings.... but no... EVERY SINGLE piece was raw!!!! We got the manager and he was so shocked, apologetic, and comped the meal and offered something else. But with that, my appetite was shot. The kitchen crew needs to be reprimanded and taught food handling safety.  I will never come back again. I Felt for the poor manager who had to deal with this.

They finally seated us in 2 booths because it was going to be another 20 minutes for a table for 8. (kids in 1, adults in another). The waitress was curt and seemed annoyed by us because we ordered a grilled cheese and then cancelled (she hadn't even left the table btw). She brought our appetizers with the meal even though we specifically asked her to bring them before. The cauliflower was horrible (overlooked and way too much tumeric), the Mac & cheese had no cheese and the flatbread was too salty. We only sent back the cauliflower bcoz it was really inedible. The manager came up to us to see how we were doing. We politely told him our grievances and he acknowledged them but did not even buy us dessert.  At the end of the meal, she asked us if we wanted 2 separate checks (remember they sat us in 2 separate booths side by side - 4 of our kids ranging from ages 9-13- were together and 4 adults in the other booth). I thought she was joking and I pointed at the little 9 year old boy and said ""it's on him today!"" Sure enough, she brings us 2 separate checks and hands 1 to the 9 year old boy!

12,Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3015,223,141.0,5.0,2017-08-27,"Finally at my 200th Yelp review!! YAY!! It only seems right to review this BJ's location because the service we received last night was definitely five star worthy!  I usually go to BJ's because I love their pizza and pizookies. I've only been to this particular location once though and it was a few years ago. Yesterday I happened to be in the area because I wanted Porto's. Its literally right down the street from this restaurant and when deciding where to eat for dinner it came down to BJ's. Perfect! I put our party on the waiting list through the BJ's app and we set off in their direction.  One great thing about this restaurant is that there is a big parking garbage literally a few feet away from the entrance. You get two hours free WITH validation from the restaurant. So that makes it pretty convenient. You don't have to worry about circling around looking for parking since there is plenty of space in the parking garage.  So when we entered the restaurant I was actually shocked to see the waiting area empty! On a Saturday night?! It may have something to do with the fact that the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight was on this particular night and BJ's so happened to not be showing it so maybe people opted for the Buffalo wild wings down the street or maybe a bar in the area that was showing the fight. Nonetheless, there was hardly a wait for us. Â We did wait for maybe 5 minutes or less but they gave us a nice booth for a party of three so that was pleasant.  We sat down and started looking over the menu. Even though i already knew what I wanted. Our waitress came around and introduced herself, I feel bad I don't remember her name! But she was attentive during our entire visit. She gave a long intro on the restaurant's most popular and most recent additions to the menu.  This particular location offers a child's ""appetizer"" consisting of a side of fresh fruit and I believe it was a garlic knot. Super cute and I'm surprised to see that they are the only location doing this! I've gone to quite a few other locations scattered across SoCal and none of them did this for my son. So I am glad to say that this location definitely has an advantage for this with little ones! It's nice that they added this feature with the kids meals. Now on to our appetizer. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress put in the order quickly and we were pleasantly surprised to see it come out very VERY quickly. However, upon eating it we discovered it had a very liquid texture and the dip was COLD!! We flagged down one of the other waitresses walking around and let her know the situation. She quickly took it back and said they would make a new one for us.  A few minutes passed and our waitress showed up going asking about our appetizer. We confirmed with her it was cold and she apologized right away, mentioning that she brought it to her manager and the cooks were making us a fresh one. Imagine our surprise when the manager, Demetri, came by our table and PERSONALLY apologized for the mishap with our appetizer. He mentioned to us that he suspected there was a step in the cooking process that was skipped.  He was kind enough to take the item off our bill. And even brought the new dish to our table himself. He was very kind to us and made sure our visit was nothing less than five star. Definitely the main reason I think so highly of this location now!  The rest of the visit was great! Our food was good. The service was prompt and I definitely look forward to coming back in the future should we be in the area. Demetri is a wonderful manager and he really does care about the experience his customers receive! Five stars all the way!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale,3.12,2.86,3.184,2.804,2.9640000000000004

So, here's my story. We got there at about 7:45 tonight, there was only one lady ahead of us so we waited patiently for our turn.While she was being led by the male host to her table, a couple ladies walked in and stood inline behind us. To our surprise, the blond hostess completely ignored us who were standing directly in front of her and proceeded to ask the ladies behind us how many were in their party. We got her attention and told her we were not with the earlier lady. She proceeded to tell us that the ladies behind us came before us. SERIOUSLY! When we told her we were there before them, she had the nerve to ask the ladies behind us if that was true and they both agreed we were there before them. Instead of apologizing for her mistake, she grudgingly picked up the menus, told us to follow her, stopped at a table and said your waiter will be with you shorty and that was that. I was left perplexed and fuming mad. If we didn't have a starving child, I would have walked out of there. I told our server what happened and she in turn mentioned it to the manager who came and apologized and said he will take care of it.  I appreciate that everyone was very apologetic but she totally ruined our night. I hope that this will serve as a learning experience for this young lady.

135,TC K.,"Glendale, CA",85,5,1.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"Omg, we are from Chicago and moved here 5 years ago. Masa Of Echo Park has the recipe from our best deep dish pizza from Chicago. It's the best you'll ever have. That being said, we had a taste for deep dish and wanted something closer. We new it wouldn't be close to what we are use to, but expected some kind of decent from here. We just picked up our deep dish. We ate it because we were starving. It was unbelievably sad. It reminded me of my Grammer schools pizza. My husband and I literally said that Little Caesars is better. What a joke? I'm so pissed that we paid $16 for 8 inches of dough. It was just a thick piece of dough with what seemed like a bit of cheese and absolutely no sauce. Thank god I asked for tomatos, mushrooms and olive or there would be nothing but dough. Truly crap. They should be embarrassed to put that out. I'm embarrassed for them. My husband picked it up curb side and had to talk to three different people just to get it. Also, when I ordered it over the phone, the girl repeated everything I asked to other people because she couldn't answer my questions, including asking a co-worker if she spelled tomatos right.. Â yes, I could hear her ask. I asked if they have more cheese than sauce so I could know wether to ask for more sauce, she had no clue what I was asking of her. Omg.. never again. What a joke.

It came in a bread bowl and it was so delicious! I'm not a big eggroll fan big the avocado eggrolls were great. And so was the Artichoke dip.  The only sucky part about this BJs Restaurant is their parking. It is an underground parking structure behind the restraints built for the entire building which includes other businesses and restaurants.

53,Jeanna M.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-17,"I have had the worse experience ""ever"" with my visit to your Glendale BJs Restaurant. I am extremely upset.  For the first time and last, I ordered two pizzas online for take-out at 4:39pm... the pizzas were to be ready at 7pm. I ordered the pizzas for a special occasion... I had people waiting for me. I arrived at the restaurant at 6:50. I spoke to the worker, Katherine. I showed her my order information on my cellphone. She stated that the kitchen was still working on my pizzas and they would be ready soon. I sat there in front of them and periodically asked if my order was ready. At least six people came and went with their take-out orders. People were going in-and-out of the dining areas.  Kathrine offered to have me pay while I waited, it took at least 20 minutes to get that correct. The manager, Armando Gonzalez, needed to come assist twice because it was done incorrectly (his fault). He came once and discounted only one pizza, then he needed to come back to discount the other. He should've got it correct the first time. The staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off... disorganized, unprofessional, inappropriate, rude. The manager was just as bad as his staff, who he obviously does not supervise.  I waited in the restaurant for an entire hour (6:50pm to 7:50pm). There was one young male employee there, who looked at my husband and I (in the eye) and sang loudly... ""hit the road Jack, and don't come back here no more"". I should've got his name, not that it matters to me anymore... I will not be returning. Your restaurant is getting a very bad review from me and my entire family (who waited so long with horrible service). Additionally, I received my two pizzas after an hour of waiting... they were two, cold, uncooked pizzas. I live a block away. I walked a block to get home and open the pizza boxes to COLD, UNCOOKED, doughy pizzas. On my order, I specified that I wanted the pizzas ""cook well done"". After waiting in the restaurant for a full hour, you would think at least they would freshly and thoroughly cook them... but NO.  I literally feel sick. I am dissatisfied with the entire experience from beginning to at this moment. It is not over for me. I will continue to complain.. Again, it was by far the worst experience in my many years of life.  Dissatisfied",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=60,2.88,2.77,3.076,2.34,2.814

There's only so much customer service Â  You can provide at some point the quality of the food is just as important if not more.

Order was simple enough, the Santa Fe salad and requested that the chicken be warmed up, I have this aversion with eating cold chicken. The waitress Kayla did her job, she put in the order and even showed it to my husband and I, ""Santa Fe Salad with fresh grilled hot chicken"" also ordered chicken wings with sauce on the side... food shows up, chicken is ice cold, and wings had sauce smothered.  To the kitchen manager, it is not that difficult to read, the instructions were there, customers make requests because they want to eat food that they enjoy.

48,Andrea M.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-10-22,"Poor house management.  -We ordered 2 large pizzas (simple, straight off the menu) and a salad.  -Food didn't come out for close to 45min later and pizza was cold, cheese had solidified and pan it came in wasn't even slightly warm. -Likely it was made within a reasonable time but had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before being served. Delivery pizza would arrive warmer than this. It tasted dry and like store bought frozen pizza.  -For a place that was originally founded in pizza, it was extremely disappointing to get such bad pizza. Not to mention the service, which was slow and rather inattentive. We had to ask for our check several times. We had validated 2 hour parking, and didn't even make it out in time.  -I've eaten at other BJs before years ago, and remember the pizza being great and served hot. Not sure if it's this location in particular or a change in their business model but definitely not the same anymore.  -Restaurant was fairly full as it's in a high traffic area, but having a continual flow of customers is no excuse for poor food and service. I noticed many tables full of people waiting for a while for food like us, without anyone coming by to check on them or apologize for the wait.  -It's pretty simple, pay attention to your customers and your product.

So once they finally tuned the correct TV, they had the other party move to our TV area. 2) We ordered an appetizer sampler platter that came out after our entrees.  3) My steak was raw. Not rare. Raw. And worse, this was a ribeye, so the fat hadn't rendered out. I hate sending food back but I had to in this case. My other gripe regarding this was then being asked if I wanted a new steak or my old one cooked longer. Ehhh I think a new steak should have been the default action. But I just asked for the latter because I'm a chickenshit and didn't want to seem fussy. I guess I deserved the charred piece of meat that was brought back out to me. Now, as I said, our server was a total sweetheart. He handled all of the above-referenced hiccups in a friendly and professional matter. Even when I was starting to get antsy about the football game still not being on.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed (but really, during a Dodgers World Series game??) or just disorganized but this isn't the slam dunk sports-watching joint I was hoping it'd be. The food was mostly fine, though, so I'd be willing to give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale,2.88,2.71,3.024,2.348,2.7779999999999996

When we finally sat down the server had a snotty attitude and wasn't very friendly at all seemed like we were a bother to her.

Our bill was $284, so we gave the waiter $275 in cash and told him to put the rest on the card. Well what we got back was a credit card charge of $50, which made no sense. We thought he included the tip as well, but we asked him and he said no. It was extremely sketchy, and we asked him to count it in front us, but he only counted $225. However we were certain we gave him $275, because we counted it beforehand. Be cautious of how you pay at this particular BJ's, either pay the exact amount in cash or put it all on the card. Don't split like we did or else you might get scammed! Never coming to this particular branch again.

21,Harry S.,"Glendale, CA",19,48,,1.0,2017-12-14,"Family and I had an utter nightmare dining experience here a month ago. I figured I would let the anger subside so I might approach a review with objectivity over sheer animus and rage. The rage and animus persist. It was that bad.  My 12-year-old insisted on eating here for his birthday. The host assured us we would have heat lamps if we sat outside, or would have to wait an hour to sit inside, even though it was empty. He couldn't explain why.  It was a cold night. Wife, three small kids, and I kept pleading, but the heat lamps did not arrive as promised. Instead, they put one about 10 feet form out table with a dim flame that gave no heat. We were freezing.  To make matters worse, we had a horrible waiter. Neglected the table, got our order wrong four separate times, brought us cold food, and a plate of food that looked like it had fallen on the floor and molded back together by someone with filthy hands.  We decided to leave mid-way through the meal. But, our waiter disappeared. I roamed the restaurant in search of the waiter or manager. Eventually found a manager that was dressed like a slob and completely useless and unapologetic.  We should have just walked out, but waited patiently for the check. When it arrived, it had a series of items we ordered, but which never came. We reminded our waiter these items never arrived and he repeated over and over, ""I will check on it.""' We couldn't wait out in the cold any longer. Paid the full amount, including about $35 of food that never arrived.  There was not one redeeming thing about this place. The food and service were awful. The restroom was filthy. Management was useless.  This now takes first spot for worst dining experience I have EVER had. Sadly, this will be the most memorable part of my kid's birthday.  My contribution today to the world: NEVER EAT HERE. IT IS HORRIBLE.

We arrived here at 10:01p (see the attached photo of our parking validation) which means we were in the actual restaurant by 10:05p or so. We sat in the bar area where a server and a manager passed us every 5 minutes or so. After being here for about 20 minutes, someone approached us and asked if we needed menus. We said yes. 10min later someone came back to take our order. Fast forward to another 10min from there and we finally got our drinks. In total, that's 40min from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks. At one point, the manager walked past and we grabbed his attention in hopes of expediting the experience, but that yielded no positive results. He said he'd have someone ""take care of us"".

Food and soups were served cold (not even warm); wine glass served with lipstick marks then brought back with obvious marks where those lipstick marks were wiped away. The calamari appetizer was brought out - with the waitress explaining that the portion was much smaller than usual but we could keep it if we wanted to. Â One of the kid meals was missing fries and I kid you not - they brought out a plate of fries in record time - and upon inspection by the child - there was ""stuff"" on the fries like it was from someone's else's meal or order - god forbid from someone's plate after they were done! The pace of service was unfortunate - and our waitress was very nice and apologetic. The only good parts of the night were the adult entrees - thank goodness!
