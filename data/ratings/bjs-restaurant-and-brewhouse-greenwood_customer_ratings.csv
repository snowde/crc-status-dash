159,Molly W.,"Brownsburg, IN",9,85,,3.0,2012-01-03,"Let's be honest. BJ's isn't one of those places you visit to get the most amazing meal ever. But it is a nice stand-by when you want some basic American food or pizza. And if you do end up there and want a non-alcoholic drink, make sure to try their strawberry lemonade (and then ask for a to-go cup at the end of your meal).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=120,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0200000000000005,3.3600000000000003

While I was venturing though s&*#tiest state in the union, Indiana  I saw that oasis of BJ's reminding me of sunny beautiful socal. Turns out it was actually for real..  These midwestern idiots will line up their cars for blocks when a Sonic or Jack in a Box opens up. If you are from the west... you know those places are garbage that only homeless people eat at. BJ's on the other hand is the spot. Yea it's a chain... but they are all busy in California... all the time... the food is solid..  If you live near here... before you go to bed each night make sure you say a thank you prayer to god for delivering you a BJ's in your god forsaken state.  Sure the quality here wasn't as nice as say...

Despite being a 'brewhouse' the only thing they brew on site is their sodas. We were a little bummed to hear this, but the offerings on their beer list were enough to make a couple of microbrew lovers happy. So that's not a huge deal. We were informed that they were running a special that night, soup or salad for two, a pizza (large I think), and a desert for like $20 or $25. We were all over that. The pizza was pretty damn good. And the crazy Oreo desert was pretty delicious too, and I don't even like Oreos.  Service was great and the vibe inside this place is pretty cool too.

The second time I went, I left with a much better impression.  I was there for a casual wedding reception and they had a pizza buffet set out for us.   The pizzas were really good with a nice thick, yet not too chewy, crust and a zesty sauce.  Even the beers tasted a little more flavorful than my previous visit.

Their ""guest"" draft beer selections are better. The prices for their beers and food items are way too high - I think everything could be lowered $2+. But, the place is nice inside, for a chain, and it's huge and the service is nothing to complain about. We did have a pizza there one night that was really good.

It's served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Share it with a friend.  The beer is all good and true to style. There's nothing adventurous or overly creative.  The menu is big and comparable to TGIFriday's.  The chain was started by guys from Chicago to bring deep dish pizza to California. I stick with the pizza as that seems to be the speciality. My favorite is the classic combo - sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. Also enjoy the BBQ Chicken and the Mediterranean.

Their housemade beer is pretty good.. I had the new signature Blonde Lager.  It has great a taste, but is only a 12 ounce glass. At $5+ thats a bit steep, but good none the less.  The service... was pathetic.  Our server was a bit of jerk.  I don't know.. maybe our $100+ table bill was a turn off because we also had a kid with us?

The wedge salad was very small, as if they was running out of lettuce, all 3 salads would have made 1 salad at any other restaurant. Our pizzas were just as skimpy, they had bare minimum toppings.

We waited another minute and then left. As we were walking out surprisingly our server appeared and said hi to us. We responded that we waited 10 minutes and were leaving. Her response was ""my apologies"". Again, the manager never said or did anything.

I am happy Management read it, that means they are using this system which totally replaces stupid cards at the table that you can fill out, but never will. So I came back to this place for lunch the other day and we got seated again in Shannon's area, because I knew I would get great service again. Shannon isn't the kind of server though who greets you with a high pitch voice and gets all excited about it. She is professional, who most of the servers with high pitch voices aren't, and again, she is knowledgeable. She knows the food she sells, she can give you honest advice about certain meals and is just a professional, friendly, highly efficient server.  We ordered a salad with roasted brussel sprouts and they weren't really roasted. Tip for the kitchen: check out how the Barefoot Contessa does ""Roasted brussel sprouts"". Ever since I make them her way, my entire family eats brussel sprouts. Overall the salad was very good. The Moroccan inspired Salmon was good, but the Couscous wasn't real Couscous. They didn't use granules of durum wheat, which is the main ingredient in couscous, instead they used something different. Anyhow, the taste was good.

I went once when it was somewhat busy, and I had to send my steak back because it wasn't cooked properly. When the waiter brought me a new one (after everyone else at my table had finished their meals, of course), he sat it in front of me and without saying a word, walked away. The steak still wasn't cooked right but I just wanted to leave at that point. Then last night while being seated the hostess had her phone in her hand/was using her phone the entire time she was working, and our waitress seemed to care less about us as soon as we got our meals.

I usually sit at the bar which is more spacious, and as I learned, provides a higher level of service. I suppose the mood didn't start out so well when the waitress spilt water all over my sister and me. She didn't offer us towel; we were on our own to collect napkins around the table to dry our seats up. I guess she felt that calling us all 'sweetie' continually would make up for it. So we're waiting for the food, the kids trying to color but the crayons kept breaking. No big deal. Some had salads. The wrong salads were given to the wrong people which became complicated when it not was realized until after bites were taken. My aunt ordered rice and found a white piece of plastic like maybe part of a lid in it.  Good thing she's a nurse; she can give herself the Heimlich. Sadly, the food was just bad this night.  Ribeyes were tough and rubbery; not edible. Carrots had brown spots on them. Very thin asparagus and very stingy on the broccoli. One thing they were very generous with was lemons. Everything seemed to be garnished with lemons. My sister ordered the Maui Maui tacos, she couldn't find the Maui on it; lots of lettuce though. So it wasn't all bad - everyone who ordered a chicken dish seemed to be happy. I had the pesto mushrooms and fried artichoke which was pretty interesting.  I could have used a breath mint afterwards though. The desserts were unimpressive; the sundaes were mostly whipped cream.  It was okay; I've had worse, but I've had much better.  In the end though, the server literally stood over my chair until I paid the bill and then gave me one last condescending 'sweetie' for good measure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.404,3.4800000000000004

Welcome to my life.  The nice thing about BJ's is that, next to Cheesecake Factory, it has the biggest darn menu I've ever seen.  Steak, burger, pasta, pizza, chicken, vegetarian, soup, salad, you name it and BJ's has is.  The food, whatever you choose, is consistently good.  Sometimes the service is a bit slow, but it's mostly because it is a HUGE place and always crowded.  A few items of note: Pizza - deep dish - amazing.  From individual to large, it takes a bit longer but worth the wait.   Burgers - very very good. Lemon Chicken - delish Bread bowl soups - fantastic. If you're into the beer scene (think brewpub, not Budweiser) they have a full menu of in house brews.  And for the kids (or people like me who prefer the soda to the beer) they have their own root beer and cream soda on tap - both amazing, and as a bonus both come with free refills! For dessert, be sure to try the Pizooki which is a fancy name for cookie in a cup with ice cream on top.  But they sure are good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=20,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.504,3.6800000000000006

16,Jalee L.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,122,244.0,5.0,2016-05-15,"I am very comfortable with the statement that BJ's is in fact my favorite Pizza in the Indy area. It's a lot of commitment, I know, but I have been through the gamete of local pizza joints and chains alike and nothing can rival the perfection. It's thick (more than hand-tossed, less than true chicagoan) with a blended crust (not rimmed) that is buttery, but never greasy. It's pepperoni is more than just circular, its cubed, sliced and chunks covering every inch. As the name implies- it's Pepperoni Extreme.  It pairs perfectly with BJ's Pizookie (Yes, a cookie made in a pizza tin) served with ice-cream. Cookies & Cream, Triple Chocolate Chunk, Peanut Butter, Macadamia nut, etc etc. Go all the way and do 1/2 & 1/2 on the pizooki flavors. Peanut Butter and Chocolate paired will never lead you wrong.  Since you are at a brewhouse- give the Jerry Burst a try. It's a mixture of Jeremiah Red and a Berry Burst Cider. It lightens the beer and balances the cider's sweetness. If non-alcoholic is your preference their homemade cream soda will hit the spot.

I ordered west coast IPA on tap. So delicious. Good stuff Everything else was good. I particularly satisfied with the server. She was a top notch.

Not sure if this was from the bar, or perhaps an area that was unclean near where I was standing, or what.

50,Ryan F.,"Greenwood, IN",0,11,,1.0,2017-06-10,"Unfortunately, my experiences here continue to get worse each time I dine here.  Tonight I decided to do three (3) appetizers instead of a main entree.  The brussell sprouts were burnt and over crispy (e.g. the kitchen and/or the runner should not even have allowed this to leave the kitchen) the stuffed mushrooms were soggy and very small, and the ahi poke was missing two (2), poki sauce and avocado, of the six (6) basic ingredients.  A complete disaster of a meal.  The couple sitting next to me received the wrong entree because the waitress pushed the wrong button on the new automated ordering system they are using.  When even appetizers are a disaster it is time to move on to other dining options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=20,3.52,3.68,3.68,2.5000000000000004,3.6160000000000005

57,Janet D.,"Indianapolis, IN",16,14,16.0,1.0,2017-06-30,"I had dinner there last night with a friend. I have to say this is the worst food I've had in a long time and I was genuinely shocked.  I've had appetizers there before but never a meal. The steak was shameful, barely lukewarm and completely devoid of any flavor - tasteless and unseasoned.  The ginger creamed corn sounded like a good idea but the ginger was way over the top, this dish still has some potential if they aren't so heavy-handed on the spice. It looked like a baked potato but a loaded baked potato is a far exaggeration.  The bacon was burned and the potato overcooked, no sour cream, chives or butter was on it and it appeared to be re-heated.  I requested butter, sour cream, etc after my meal came without it. If it's actually possible, the potato had no flavor & the cheese on it was quite waxy.  I had a cocktail, the Pink cadillac...also rather bland and nothing to write home about. Service was mediocre at best.  My waitress was pleasant but dry, not overly attentive and appeared to not be thrilled to be there.On a positive note, the ambiance is perfect!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=20,3.24,3.61,3.61,,3.462

Considering how big the servings were, the price was great, only $8.25. The soup was very good. The pizza was a personal deep dish. It was wonderful.

We were one of maybe four tables at the time and our waiter was still MIA whenever we needed more to drink, checks, or anything else. He also didn't have a great grasp of the menu when we asked questions and then blamed it on corporate changing things all the time.

0,Eric U.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,4.0,2017-09-04,My favorite late night place for an awesome  Pizza . Last Saturday night we decided to have a pizza so my first choice has always  been BJ's.  We placed our order for beer and waited for the pizza . We noticed It was taking longer than normal for our pizza when the Manager came up and notified us that the pizza was sitting in the window and someone else took it to another table for another customer so we waited for another one to be made and delivered. I know this was no fault of our waitress but when we finally got ours delivered it was cold . I didn't say anything about it being cold but I wanted to .  I feel sorry for the waitress since she told me this had been happening all night to her orders.  We will keep visiting BJ 's since we love the bar and home brewed beer. The pork chop dinner is the best one around Indy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood,3.44,3.66,3.66,,3.5720000000000005

I love the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They bring out little garlic bread knots for the kids right after you order, which helps keep them occupied.

15,Mike B.,"Great Falls, VA",17,38,82.0,1.0,2017-09-23,Not your typical BJ restaurant.  I go to the BJs in Virginia and Pittsburgh on a regular basis.   We were a group of five.  Four of the meals came out and my dinner didn't come out.  We had to ask as we weren't told what happened.   I had ordered shrimp tacos. - not a long prep time item.  Every other member in our party had finished their food before the manager took the time to come over to apologize. My food arrived at same time as our check arrived.  The manager said they thought other manager  had handled the situation or moved the miss order up in the process - neither of which happened.  Very disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood,3.4,3.66,3.66,,3.5560000000000005

Perhaps it was due to me ordering pizza here though, because my wife really loved her steak. The signature deep dish pepperoni was OK, but not quite amazing.

The stuffed mushrooms had to be sent back and we finally received them at the end of the meal. My salad had the wrong dressing and my husband's steak was so rare ( ordered medium) he had to send it back. Second attempt at the steak was just as bad- overdone and he couldn't even chew it. Tonight we tried carry out - deep dish pizza. I called and was told I'd have to wait another 5-10 minutes because it wasn't finished. No problem. It was cold and dried out. Not what I'm expecting for a fresh pizza that I had to wait longer for.

Then I happened to run into the original California location on a college spring break trip. This chain has certainly evolved from that original pizza shack. The Greenwood location is a huge TV-equipped restaurant with an even larger menu. The deep dish pizza is still a highlight, but if you are like me, you will probably be looking for a lighter meal after filling up on craft beer and appetizers. They have great burgers, Mediterranean Pita sandwiches, and surprisingly salads. Of course they have the Pizzookie, too--essentially a cookie cake baked in a deep dish pizza pan--that is always tempting.
