464,Robert W.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",40,20,,4.0,2012-01-04,"BJ's Henderson has really very good food, lots of variety, well trained staff and is apparently well run.  Many Yelp reviews indicate a successful dining experience is very likely here. Somebody may have had a less quality experience, but ours was VERY GOOD! Those less than good results may be ""an off night"" or just bad luck, I can't say, what we saw and experienced was all positive.   Judy was our server, perfectly attentive,with sound recommendations. I would, and will come back without any hesitation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=420,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.248,3.8
208,Brenda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,436,1240.0,4.0,2012-01-19,"This is for their chicken tortilla soup ONLY! YUMMMMMMMMMMMM is all I can say. I love how they come out with the bowl filled with the tortilla chips, avocado, lime and chicken and then they pour the broth in your bowl at the table. That way the tortilla chips are never soggy and it's just cool to see.  I ended up ordering the half potato (grilled chicken) and soup. It definitely filled me up for $8.00-$9.00? There was a lunch rush, but everything seemed to come out quickly. Overall, I have always been a fan of BJ's and now that its walking distance from work I will be here more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=200,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.248,3.84
343,Ed R.,"Reno, NV",12,138,,2.0,2012-01-25,"Just finished one of the lunch specials called Baracoa Taco's. The tag-line for these was low calories. There was a picture of the plate on a table tent, looked good, went for it. And then, it was served...and luckily I have good vision, or I am afraid I would not have seen them. Tere are three tiny tacos and a bowl of black beens. The tacos were maybe 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the beans in the picture number likely  around 200, and I got maybe 30, covered in bean sauce. They should have placed a quarter on the plate in the picture to give some sense of scale. They could have served an eighth of a hamburger and got away with the same lo-cal claim. Anything reduced to micro size will be lo-cal. As for taste, OK, no better.

197,Tida C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1186,157,875.0,5.0,2012-01-30,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BJ'S!  Food: I love the Cajun Pasta, Usually when I go out to eat I'm not very adventurous. I like to stick to what I know but for some odd reason I decided to try something new. Cajun pasta, hmm first off I wasn't to sure how I would like this because I love Cajun spices of on my seafood but I wasn't to sure how I'd like it on my pasta. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. The creamy tomato sauce with the roasted blacken chicken breast YUMMMM. The portions are even great, once me and my boyfriend went and we actually just ordered 1 Cajun pasta and when asked them for an extra plate because we were sharing they offered to just put it together in the kitchen for us & it was perfect for two!  Desert: If you haven't tried Bj's famous Pizookie your missing out. A cookie that's freshly baked right out of the oven warm topped with Vanilla ice cream is to die for. Even when I'm stuffed from my entree i'll still find room for a Pizookie. Some how! lol Drinks: I love their wide range of beers on tap, unfortunately they didn't have the blue moon pumpkin beer because it's only a seasonal beer. Tap beer is always better then bottle or canned Just saying... Service: I  usually go pretty late like 9:30-10ish? & I'm usually 1 out of 5 tables there. So its not busy during those hours but the waitress that we got was super nice. The hostess seated me and my boyfriend at a table that was just way to big for us and it made it difficult for us to kind of talk and dine together so the waitress noticed this and asked if we wanted to change tables. Other than that and when ordering she offered to tell the cooks in the back to split my Cajun pasta into two plates because I was sharing. I've never been to a restaurant where they offered to split it in the back for me. Usually they just hand me my extra plate so I really appreciated the extra effort to help :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=260,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.3480000000000003,3.84
349,Tyler B.,"Henderson, NV",7,62,5.0,1.0,2012-02-09,"It hurts me to even write this review but I feel like I should at least give a little heads up to someone who might be trying their lunch menu. I had the barbacoa tacos which consist of three super small tacos filled very conservatively and a side of black beans. Flavor was moderate. My GF had the fish tacos which looked normal size and pretty delicious. Sadly the appearance didn't match the taste. When I had a bite it tasted like a frozen fish stick stuck inside of a bland tortilla. Our other friend had the dinner jambalaya and they thought it was really tasty. We had the pizookie trio for dessert and it as always was awesome.  As for the service, started off ok but ended pretty bad. We were waiting for our refills and thought it was taking a bit long when we noticed that our waiter was standing back in the servers holding a conversation with his friend. Luckily another waitress came by and pretty much took over our table until he finished his conversation.  From what I can tell this is the type of place where it's best just to eat off their dinner menu no matter what. I thought lunch menu meant same quality smaller portions but apparently it means smaller portions and no quality. As for the service I still think there will always be a few bad apples no matter where you go and it seems that I just have bud luck at this location.  Probably going to drive across town next time and see if I can better service and order my delicious buffalo chicken pizza and rootbeer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=400,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.9480000000000004,3.7200000000000006
431,Joey P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,48,,3.0,2012-02-10,"Excruciatingly sloooowwwww service.  I've never witnessed such inefficient serving.  Bring drinks, don't take food order; bring order, but don't bring the meals for the kids because you can't carry everything.  How about just get the kids first, then the rest?  Drop off to go boxes after meal and not the check, too.  Lost 10-15 minutes of time waiting for huge gaps in service. Food was fine, but I as a patron should not have to ask ""could you take my order"" or ""could I have my check"" when clearly I was ready for both at those times.   Our server was either new or just not ready for work that day because she was operating in slow motion compared to her coworkers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=500,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.2440000000000007,3.6800000000000006

558,Joie A.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",18,1,,4.0,2012-02-18,"My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice lunch date together instead of the usual fast food run so we went to BJ's. BJ's isn't a fancy restaurant but it is a little more on the pricier side, but definitely worth it. We usually don't eat so heavily for lunch but we couldn't help ourselves once we saw the menu. We decided on the stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer because we heard a lot of good things about them and they were 100% right. The stuffed mushrooms were so delicious, perfect for an appetizer because the small portions definitely boosted up my appetite because I know for sure that I wanted more. Soon after our appetizer we received our soup of choice, I got the clam chowder and my boyfriend got their chili. The clam chowder was pretty good, nothing too special about it but there was nothing wrong with it either. The chili on the other hand needed an acquired taste I guess because I wasn't very fond of it because of the beer flavor. Since BJ's is a brewery I'm not surprised but it just didn't taste right to me. My boyfriend ate it because he ordered it but he wasn't the biggest fan of their chili either. (on a side note: a different time I went, I had their tomato soup and it was incredibly delicious...since we're on the soup subject.) after we finished our soup we noticed we weren't getting very good service because our server hadn't taken away our appetizer platter and we were done with our soups already, and our glasses were empty. Usually Im not picky and I don't mind but it wasn't busy at the time we went and our table was extremely tiny because it was just the two of us. I felt cluttered and a bit forgotten by our server. We ended up having to ask another server if they could take our plates and refill our drinks because our server was no where to be found. Anyways, when we finally got our main dishes, all was forgotten because the food was literally to die for. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken in lemon cream sauce. The portion was huge but I can't complain because I ordered from the dinner section, but I'm not complaining because leftovers was fine with me. I order an extra side of the lemon cream sauce because it was too delicious not to, and the chicken to sauce ratio was not sitting right with me with the extra sauce. Every bite was dreamy and delicious. The dish came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The two sides went magnificently with the lemon cream sauce. If I could have, I most definitely would have finished but my stomach wouldn't allow it. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya they serve there. I'm not a big fan of jambalaya in the first place so I don't want to comment on it since its already not my cup of tea. We knew about they're famous pizookies but we were way too full from our meal so we got our check, left a little less than decent tip for our ghost server and left. All in all the lunch was incredible. I definitely love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=540,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.216,3.8

I really only go to this place for beers and clam chowder.  There's lots of other stuff on the menu, but I haven't bothered with it too much.  I like the clam chowder so much I feel like I'm missing out if I try anything else.  With that said, I have tried a burger and a pizza here.  Both were pretty good if my memory serves me. The clam chowder in a sourdough bowl.   Its good clam chowder; thick without being too thick.  The best part is the bread bowl though.  They butter the hell out of the ""lid"" and toast it.  It's amazing.  The bread is flakey on the outside and soft on the inside.

552,Kat G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,118,43.0,3.0,2012-03-04,"Tried the gluten-free pizza. Crust was way better than Sammie's Woodfired, but needed to ask for a side of sauce. They don't carry vegan cheese so without the cheese the gf pizza is just a crust with 1 tablespoon? of sauce spread on it. First time the sauce the server brought was fresh out of the fridge- really? To put on a hot pizza? Then she came back with some warm sauce per our request- in the bowls they probably serve ketchup in but I only had 1 piece of pizza left after waiting for the sauce.  Luckily we had ordered 3 toppings ($1 each) or it would have been extremely sad. They really should have all their signature pizzas available to order & just charge extra for the gluten-free crust. It was still good but I can make this at home buying the gf crust from Whole Foods deli (tastes & looks the same). Not sure we'll be back again. This is not a real gf pizza like Picazzo's in Arizona or Fresh Brothers in LA.

My husband and I eat here at least once a month. We usually share a small pizza, which is plenty. They serve deep dish style pizza, while not exactly reminiscent of Chicago it is no doubt delicious. There isn't really sauce on the pizza, but there are tomatoes which I tend to push aside. The pizza is best complimented with a delicious Cobb salad. This salad is fantastic with a creamy garlic dressing, croutons, turkey, avocado, and cheese. I also enjoy their sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with their wedge or shoestring fries. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and they have quite an extensive menu. It is seriously delicious American style food. If you find yourself here you really must get a Pizookie for dessert, it is required and I often come here just for a Pizookie!

Somewhere along the way our meal timing got messed up.  The appetizer (poke - absolutely delicious) came out less than a minute before our entrees.  This led to that awkward situation where you try and eat the app as fast as possible so your meal doesn't get cold.  The poke was amazing, so not an issue. While we were shoveling tuna into our faces, the manager came over.  He profusely apologized for the timing issue and said if we wanted to have a dessert he would pick up the tab on that.  Very nice, we thought, but not needed.  The timing thing wasn't really an issue for us, but it was a really nice gesture on the manager's part. Please be warned that it's really tough to pick an entree at BJ's.  Their menu is extensive and everything sounds delicious.  The entrees we picked were both fantastic (Chicken Marsala and Tuscan Chicken Limone).  If ever there was a restaurant to not be a fat American, BJ's is it.  Take half home.  Their portions are large and should definitely not be consumed in one sitting. Since the manager went out of his way to offer us the dessert, we opted for the peanut butter pizookie.  It's a warm peanut butter cookie, about 8"" across, with ice cream on top.  Everyone has an inner fat girl, and she's drooling at the sound of this.  And yes, it's that good.  Ignore the diet, forget about the bathing suit body, just eat the pizookie and enjoy it. Overall, we had a decent experience at BJ's.  The food is really good, the staff is really friendly, and they seem to genuinely care about making guests happy.  The portions are pretty big, and there was definitely some awkward moments created by the staff, but I think we'll likely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=360,3.56,3.51,3.51,2.9240000000000004,3.5300000000000002

This was our second irritation. The whole time we are waiting for our food, our tool of a server was standing at the end of the bar talking with the bartender.  This guy did not care about appearances and to me it was disrespectful to just be seen hanging out. Now I am getting pissed.  Fast forward now...food comes out, granted they are still not busy, us and maybe one other table in the bar.  My sandwich and fries come out, the fries are barely warm and bottom of my sandwich is soggy.  Probably because our server left it sitting too long while he was yapping with the bartender.  I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because I do still like the place.  Our server, in my opinion deserves negative stars.  I will not name our server, but the management should start watching what goes on in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=540,3.68,3.52,3.52,2.732,3.5840000000000005

282,Justin G.,"Las Vegas, NV",584,256,234.0,2.0,2012-08-09,"They really do try hard at BJ's and I feel like they get that extra star for effort. When it comes to family friendly chain restaurants, BJs is one of the few that I like. Their food, while not of remarkable. is consistent and some dishes don't substitute in fat to make up for flavor. BJ's has been able to really define itself in what is a competitive market segment. Having it's own selection of micro-brewed beers, deep-dish pizzas, and of-course the pazookie set it apart from the likes of Claim Jumper and others.  I usually end up coming here almost once a week. The sandwiches and the deep-dish pizza (the Great White and the Mediterranean are awesome) never fail. But what really brings me in is of course the pazookie. It's their signature dessert, just like the cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory.  Service is often hit or miss, but unfortunately my last experience was a miss. I came in during happy hour with a couple friends to catch the game. The bar area was pretty barren, no wait at all. We got our seat an the server took our order. Unlike most happy hour patrons, our group ordered pretty much everything. Beers, appetizers, pizza, pazookies, everything. The food was good, but for whatever reason, our server kept rushing. Maybe she was about to get off and wanted this the tip before she clocked out, I don't know. But considering the place was totally empty, I don't get why they would want to turn this table over so fast. Feeling rushed really does ruin the dining experience, especially at a place I go to so often. She brought our check out before the pazookie arrived which is highly unusual. After dessert had arrived the server stopped by to see if we had paid, seeing we that we had not, she stood nearby waiting for us to do so. This made the whole dining experience really AWKWARD. I don't really expect every experience here to be like this, but it was really uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=340,3.44,3.48,3.48,2.8240000000000003,3.4640000000000004

BJ's is a national chain restaurant and microbrewery which is a bit like Gordon Biersch, but BJ's features a few more comfort foods on their menu and it has more of a family restaurant feel to it.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall-type location where there are several storefronts with bars and restaurants, and I get the feeling this must be mecca for many locals, as the parking lot of the entire complex was packed on this night, and we had to wait 20 - 25 minutes for a table for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday. I tried their Pumpkin Ale (one of my favorite fall beverages) and was a fan.  For our meal we shared an order of their Ahi Poke which was delicious and really hit the spot since I was very hungry.  For dinner, my friend had the chicken fried steak, and on his suggestion I had the old fashioned pot roast which was served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and veggies. Everything I had was excellent, service on this night was very good aside from one slip up (they only gave us one set of cutlery and it was difficult to find a service staff to get a second set).  I'd like to return to one of their locations at some point to try more of their other microwbrews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=220,3.48,3.47,3.47,3.024,3.474

I haven't been there, B.) I heard it was really good and C.) It would give me the opportunity to make a review on Yelp :) This place has a huge buzz, well at least from what I experiences.  True it was on a Saturday night but the place was packed with people, the lighting was hip and the overall vibe made me excited to be there!  They have their own signature brews and offered many menu options?  Uh, yes please!  Our server was quite but didn't a good job.   For my first visit, here's what I got: Drinks: A couple of glasses of the Piranha Pale Ale.  It's a hoppy ale and had a snappy flavor.  Apparently this beer took Silver in some American beer festival in the past, so I had to try it.   Appetizer: For the table, we got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.  The shrimp to everything else ratio was great and the sauce really pulled all the components together.  Sooo good!  A little messy but I definitely looked passed that! Meal: For my meal, I got the New enLIGHTened Thai chicken mango salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in a sweet citrus-chili dressing and topped with fresh sliced avocado, mint, green onions and sesame wonton crisps.  Trust me, that description was taken from BJs' website, I'm not that good at descriptions, however, I am good at giving my take on it.  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had.  The spiced jicama complimented the sweet mango and the bell peppers gave a crisp texture.  This salad was packed with seemingly clashing components but it all worked well together.   So for all of you who want to know, yes, we worked out our differences and made a possible bad situation into a completely better one.  I definitely think the food had something to do with it.  The place had a great buzz and I can't wait to come back!  Thanks guys!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=260,3.52,3.51,3.51,3.156,3.5140000000000002

I flat out asked the server "" why is the service always so bad here""' it cant be a server issue if its always bad... It has to be a management issue with payroll or terrible training!

The food was good (I ordered my food low carb: a double cheeseburger without a bun and a side of broccoli instead of fries). The kitchen was very accommodating and didn't give me a hassle about the substitution. The burger was really good and had a nice chargrilled taste to it. My problem was with the portion size of the broccoli. I know veggies are more expensive than potatoes, but COME ON! I was served 5 little florets of broccoli; one was cut in half to try to fill the empty space more. (See the photo I uploaded). I took a picture of my plate the minute it was served to me. Was there a broccoli shortage or something? I thought that was ridiculous.  The menu isn't too varied but they seem to have lots of pizza options. The ""brewhouse"" element of the place is really played down. They have a few beer tanks in the far back corner that are hidden out of view.  The food was good, the ambiance was fine, but the service was absolutely horrendous! We weren't greeting when we walked in the place for about 10 minutes -- on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm! This is a busy time and restaurants need to have on their ""game face."" When we finally were greeting, we got a nice table but then we had to wait and wait and wait for a server to greet us. Finally, after 15 minutes, we were approached. We ordered drinks...and then had to wait and wait and wait to get them! Finally we ordered our food, which took over 30 minutes to arrive. People at adjacent tables were all complaining (loudly) about how bad the service was. Our waiter disappeared for the entire meal, and we finally had to get up to go find somebody to ask for our check. It was abysmal. There were plenty of employees around, but our waiter was HORRIBLE.

I came here last week and met a friend for dinner.  We sat in the bar area were immediately greeted by a server.  She was friendly and helpful.  We ordered burgers, both of which were amazing.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger with a Chipotle mayo and he got the California burger.  They were huge and I could barely finish mine. It always seems busy there, but we didn't have to wait on the server.  I actually really like the busy atmosphere. I came here again with my best friend and goddaughter yesterday.  We were craving bloodies and my goddaughter wanted ice cream so this seemed like the perfect spot.  Right off the bat, the hostesses seemed completely uninterested and in a simple word, LAME.  Their attitude screamed ""It's Easter, I don't want to be here.""  They were just so blah and unfriendly.  Anyway, after asking if the outside patio area was shaded, she said yes and that there was a table.  She seated us out there at the one table that didn't have an umbrella.  Luckily another table was just finishing up so we moved over as soon as they left.   We got our bloodies and ice cream and were pretty happy then.  Our server was nice enough and to our surprise, we were on happy hour the entire time so our bloodies were $1 off.  The other thing that would contribute to the 2 stars is that several other tables left as we sat there and no one ever bussed the tables.  It just looked sloppy and gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=320,3.24,3.49,3.49,2.7640000000000002,3.39

This is a generic BJs, and the food is rarely ever anything that wows me so I was slightly disappointed that we had driven from NoLaVe to Hendertucky to get a pizza at BJs (huh.. hello.. we live around the corner from Old School Pizzeria!) but what really was outstanding was the service provided my the manager on duty. He was great in making sure our large group had enough room to dine comfortably, and even came back around to check up on us again. BRAVO!

Mothers Day is quite the day for brunch/breakfast/lunch. It was slow to start, the drink order took a while. Then we had to order our food, then wait for it.

The table ordered a ton of food: Breakfast pizza, Surf n Turf, french toast, shrimp taco's, pulled pork sandwich, ahi tuna salad, breakfast sandwich and a few others I'm forgetting. The portions are nice size. The potatoes with the breakfast pizza weren't seasoned well. There was way to much omelette on the pizza. The cheese could have melted more too. I think everyone was so hungry, and the food was OK, we ate. But I dont think anyone had anything spectacular that I'd rush back for.

I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist.  We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy.  As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless.  I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=140,3.08,3.31,3.31,3.0160000000000005,3.218

88,Mark H.,"Honolulu, HI",1180,312,191.0,4.0,2013-09-27,"I came here following the recommendation of the sales rep at the Bells outlet mall.  It was a good distance away from the Strip, out in Henderson--possibly a 15 - 20 minute drive. We sat on the bar for quicker service.  We had the pleasure of having Emily serve us.  Emily was fantastic--very helpful, outgoing, and offering valuable recommendations.  Not to mention she is a cutie! =D Of course when in Vegas, I am always drinking.  And dinner here was no different.  My buddy chose the 4 beer sampler while I opted for the 8 beer version.  The 8 beer sampler totaled 40oz.  Not bad for a sampler!  And only about $12.xx to boot!  Beers were of your more obscure, microbrewery variety and all sooo good.  Got a diverse range of flavors and colors of beer. Not knowing what to eat (menu is quite extensive), we chose the thai chicken wonton based on its picture in the menu.  Tapa sized portions which worked out fine since I didn't want to get stuffed off an appetizer.  The wonton texture was crispy and flaky.  The accompanying thai sauce was a bit strong on the fish sauce--use in moderation.  Good consistency of sauce--don't like watery sauce softening the wrappings of my wontons...  It was good, but I wouldn't make a strong recommendation on it.  If you are in the mood for this, then order; otherwise, not a must have. My buddy ordered the deep dish pizza.  Not sure what was the name of the specialty pizza but he ordered the meaty version.  He liked it, but I'm a pickier eater.  I thought the pizza lacked flavor as if it needed salt which is quite surprising since meat on pizza is usually salty by nature.  Not so with this pizza.  was the meat boiled prior and the saltiness leached off?  idk....  Lots of cheese but nary of tomato sauce.  Need a better balance with sauce and cheese...   Bartender Emily's favorite dish at BJ's is their jambalaya.  With so many attractive entrees in their picture menu, I had a difficult time selecting my entree.  Warily, I went with Emily's recommendation and got the jambalaya.  Thank you, Emily, for your suggestion!  I rarely eat jambalaya so don't have a frame of reference to compare against, but this passed the taste test.  Unless you have an aversion to cajun spice, I think you will enjoy this dish. Tried the Pizookie for dessert.  Hot, large & thick cookie topped a la mode with ice cream.  The contrast of the cold ice cream on the freshly baked cookie is a winning combo! To recap, mixed reviews on their deep dish pizza, but the jambalaya, 8 beer sampler, and pizookie are winners!  Ohh, and Emily is a hottie!  With dozen's of locations throughout the US, BJ's could be a good spot to fall back on for a cheap-to-moderately priced meal..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=140,3.04,3.31,3.31,3.472,3.202

The food and drinks here are always more than great, but the service which used to be just as good no longer lives up to my expectations. Both of my last visits were on slow nights where we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant.  Now I work in the service industry so I can understand certain situations but being that our server only had a couple other tables I cannot grasp the fact that he kept disappearing for lengthy periods at a time. When we first arrived he greeted us in a timely manner and brought us our waters. We then ordered an appetizer to share while deciding on our entrees. Almost 20 minutes went by before we saw our appetizer or our server again. He dropped off the appetizer in a hurry, didn't ask if we were ready to order (which we were) and proceeded to disappear again. We were done with our appetizer for 5 minutes before he finally reappeared and took our order. The food was great but we just couldn't understand where he kept disappearing off to. We even had to flag down other servers to get things we needed, like refills for our constantly empty waters (biggest pet peeve).

215,Chris V.,"Henderson, NV",771,898,4943.0,4.0,2014-02-21,"I didn't see myself coming back here and trying the pizza again. However, with a group dinner scheduled for this place, I had no choice in the matter. It took a while after our reservation time, but we were finally seated in the dining area on the street-facing side of the restaurant. I found out that the food was presented buffet-style for us, and it was right up by the wall for us to access. I guess no enterprising neighbors bothered to try to filch some extra food, but we ended up with extra food at the end. Our menu included a house salad, with an Italian dressing and a ranch dressing, a grilled chicken pasta with creamy white sauce and broccoli (and apparently not enough chicken at all), and various pizzas. The pizzas were way better than last time, mainly because the crust was not soggy. I guess they know how to cook the smaller pizzas than whatever gigantic monstrosity I experienced in my last review. I didn't get to try the combo, but the pepperoni and the chicken (with mushrooms and tomatoes) were both very solid. Most of us also ended up ordering mini pizzokies. My choice of the triple chocolate was a super sweet potentially-diabetes-inducing assault, and I enjoyed it aside from quickly gobbling up the Ghirardelli chocolate square because it wasn't going to be easy to break into small and even pieces. The one thing I didn't appreciate was that we didn't get refills on water until long after dessert. I didn't find any of the foods particularly salty, but I had a problem when I simultaneously craved and lacked water at the end of my meal. Thankfully, we got additional water refills even while we were just lounging and chatting after dessert, which made the night less uncomfortable in the end. Owing to the improvement in pizza, I'm comfortable in bumping my rating up to four stars. Although my first choice on Eastern Avenue wouldn't be a chain, I wouldn't mind coming back here at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=200,3.88,3.38,3.38,2.8640000000000003,3.58
230,Michael A.,"Amarillo, TX",2,66,113.0,1.0,2014-02-23,Have to say I was very disappointed overall. The place was very noisy; so much so that it was difficult to have a conversation at your own table. Our server was good once she got to us. We waited about ten minutes for her to come by our table.  We ordered a large pizza and several sides. The pizza came out about 30 minutes later. It was LUKEWARM at best. The crust on one side was so soggy it was pathetic. The manager was called over. He asked if we wanted another pizza (another 30 minute wait?? Not likely!!) He then left the table with no other comment. The waitress came by and said she would take off the cost of the pizza. It took two tries to get the ticket adjusted.  Too many other good pizza places around to give this place another chance.

178,Scott D.,"Henderson, NV",50,10,,1.0,2014-04-27,"There is a reason this place is called BJ's. Once you've had it in your mouth, you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason, when my coworkers want to go out for lunch, they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there, the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that, the waitress was very rude and inattentive.  Another thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends, I want to spend time talking with them, not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement).  My advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's.

467,Gregory B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,2014-05-10,"Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years, but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I, myself, am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said, our last two visits made me never want to return.  We had the same server, Jennifer S., both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger, he apologized, and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly.  He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out, she, along with anyone else, besides the manager once, never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit.  We decided to give them another chance today, assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However, once we were seated and again started waiting, we knew there was a reason why we didn't want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time, she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten, but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour, but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now, with salads, appetizers, both untouched because of no silverware, we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again, and explaining the events on this occasion and the last, he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal, and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out.  This being said, the food here is excellent and has always been.  Our service, and our server, were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something, which surprisingly wasn't that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table, she would say ""thank you"".  Even when she forgot something, there was no apology, only a ""thank you"". She obviously doesn't care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can, in no way, speak for others who she served, but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time.  We would love to have a reason to come back here, but due to the lack of service quality, follow through from management, and overall poor dining experience, I don't know if I will be returning.  If you must eat at BJ's restaurants, please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience.

My boyfriend and I were running errands in the area and have passed by this restaurant multiple times and always talked about wanting to try it out. We figured it was happy hour, so why not. We decided to sit in the bar area and to my surprise there were children running in between the tables and chairs! First off, I don't see how some parents let their children run around like crazy in a restaurant. Second off, are they even allowed in the bar area? Anyway, we put our food and drink orders in. We ordered the crispy calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, and boneless wings. We watched the soccer game while we waited (Russia vs Korea). They have a nice huge tv screen right above the bar, so seems like a good place to watch sports. We were both really hungry and ended up waiting OVER 30 minutes for anything to come to our table. Really? Over half an hour for food that are considered appetizers? Thank goodness we didn't order any entrees because who knows how long that would've taken. Of the four dishes we ordered, the avocado egg rolls were the only thing that really stuck to me. Everything else was okay. We moved onto dessert, my favorite part of any meal. We decided to go with the peach and candied pecan cobbler, which was very delicious, but ended up waiting another 20 minutes. Overall, it was just okay. Will I come back?

We also didn't get any silverware/napkins, so we had to flag her down again & then she brought ONE. She then came back about a minute later (after I took about 2 bites of my meal) & asked if we wanted dessert. I told her that we weren't sure since we just got our food. We didn't see her the rest of the time. Another waitress had to fill up my husbands water after he didn't have anything to drink for his whole meal. The different waitress then asked what we wanted for dessert & she seemed annoyed when I asked for a menu because we didn't know what there was. I'm shocked that the service was this horrible. The summerlin restaurant was PACKED (there was maybe 2-3 tables per waitress/waiter at this henderson one) & our service was way better at Summerlin. We were kind & didn't ask for much, so one star is all I can muster up for a $35 pasta & burger with all we dealt with. One star goes to the food that was actually really good. It's a shame that this is only a few minutes away, but we will go the distance so we don't leave angry again.

Everything was cooked to perfection and not to mention the amazing variety of foods and drinks. Anyways on to the main point: Our waiter was just...weird in the way of how he talked to us and did everything. Its almost as if he felt uncomfortable serving us as he didnt want to look us in the eye and did everything half-assed and handled everything passive-aggressively. I understand that being a waiter is hard especually attending to many people however this particular night was not busy at all.  It was my 21st birthday so my friend wanted to buy me a drink, & obviously we had to show I.D., I knew it was a long shot since I had just gotten my I.D. renewed (i brought the old one and a new temporary one). With that I was declined my drink, which was no big deal, untill it came time to ask the waiter if they did anything for birthdays. In a very mocking and sarcastic tone he said ""Point and laugh at you."". After 15 min he brought out a cookie with ice cream and a candle on top and just handed it to me...no ""Happy Birthday"" or anything else that other places do for your birthday.  I'm not asking for a parade, rather a little enthusiasm.  This experience left a bad taste and honestly I'm very dissapointed.  It's not that hard to engage your customers and to be nice, like really, it won't kill you I promise!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=280,3.12,3.28,3.352,3.0480000000000005,3.2160000000000006

Nothing too special about this place, but it is known for their pizzas. I ended up ordering the chicken limon pasta which was really good, but that could be because I was super hungry at that time. The pasta was filling, but it was also really buttery and oily. I don't eat that heathy, but it'd be nice if the fatty stuff wasn't just straight up obvious because it can be off putting at times. On the bright side, the two sticks of garlic bread they gave was pretty good and was a nice compliment to the dish. My friends and I got the strawberry beignet and the pizookie trio (white chocolate macadamia, Oreo, and chocolate chip) for dessert. The beignet was pretty crispy which is a big plus and the scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry pieces made it even better.   I also discovered my newfound appreciation of the Oreo pizookie. If you haven't yet, you have to try it out when you get the chance. Just be aware that the portion sizes for each of the trio is pretty small so it would be a nice small dessert for 3 people to split.

As soon as we sit down the waitress brings our menu's, and my friend promptly asks for the beer menu when the server replies with an, ""Are you even old enough?"" I didn't pick up on any sarcastic humor there, and to me that is offensive to just assume that he is not of age. It is one thing to ask for id but to blatantly state that she does not think he is of age is another. He then provides for her his german identification card which she has to go approve with the manager.  We proceed to order a bowl of soup and a few appetizers to start out with, both were very delicious. Actually one of the better bowls of clam chowder i've had in a while. We then place our order for our food I ordered a small 11"" hand tossed pizza, which i said exactly like that, my roommate orders a chicken club, and our friend orders just some shrimp tacos. 2 out of 3 of the orders come out wrong. My roommate has a very sensitive stomach and her sandwich (chicken club) some how has green chiles on it. Which is not noted on the menu so she promptly asks them to take it off. My order came out as a 9"" DEEP DISH pizza. Which was completely the wrong style of pizza i ordered. Our waitress comes out and says that ""I ordered a small and hand tossed doesn't come in small"" so she gave me a deep dish...? The hand tossed does come in an 11in size which is what I said when I ordered so I do not appreciate her trying to blame me for her mistake in the order. I told her I don't want it i'm no longer hungry at this point when she urges me to box the pizza up. The manager comes to the table, and In my experience managers are usually apologetic.

I had dinner there last night with my parents.  We were all excited to go, cuz someone told us it was really good.  I really don't like leaving a negative review for places, but It was that bad. We came in about 7pm, and we went to the hostess stand.  She just kind of stared at us, and never greeted us.  Not a hello, nothing.  Ok, whatever, maybe shes having a bad night or something.  So we tell her that we'd like a table for 3.  The other hostess came over to seat us, and kind of dropped menus in front of us on the table and just left.  No ""hi"" or anything.  It was weird. The restaurant was a little busy, but there were still many open tables and a lot of FOH employees on the floor.  It was a normal dinner time type of busy.  Not anything extreme.  Our server comes over and gets our drink order, and right off the bat he seems to really not want to be there.  OhhhhKay.... do we like have the plague or something and not know??  We'd really like to know if we are contagious or something. The food DID come out quickly, and we really enjoyed our appetizer.  But, we would have enjoyed it even more IF WE HAD SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS.  Like we tried to get ANYONE'S attention to get silverware, but employes passed our table and glanced at us, then pretended not to see us!  omg!  So we used our 3 beverage napkins.  We seriously tried to obtain some utensils.  It was super lame.   A runner came out and delivered our meals, and then she tried to bounce out all quick!  So, we flagged her down as she was leaving and asked for silverware.  And I hate flagging down an employee because I think it's rude and tacky, but we couldn't get ANYONE'S attention any other polite way. Our server did keep our drinks topped off, but I would have loved to get another beer - but I couldn't!!!  I was never asked if I wanted another, and I could not get him to stay at the table for more than like 3 seconds.  By the end of our dinner, we actually laughed amongst ourselves because the service was unbelievably bad.  We actually felt uncomfortable there.  What sucks is we went there to enjoy ourselves, and the food was good.  But wow... we made contact with 4 employees there and they all seemed standoffish, unfriendly, and we got the feeling that they all hated their job.  Like they really hated it.  I'd go as far to say they despised working there.  I mean, is there like a horrible manager there that they all hate??  We felt like we entered the twilight zone.  As I stared longingly at my empty beer glass we got the 68 dollar check, paid and left.  At least, at this very point we got a ""thank you""!  That was nice, however too late to retain us as customers.  What's sad is we really enjoyed the food, but we felt very uncomfortable.  We were kind of annoyed that we felt obligated to tip, but we felt like it's just not right to not tip someone.

Yesterday (Saturday) I went to lunch around 4 o'clock and was so disappointed. First, upon walking in we were greeted warmly, which was nice. Then, when I requested a booth the hostess seemed put out, but we were seated at a booth regardless. We waited 7 minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were finally greeted, we were informed we didn't get greeted because the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a server and failed to inform someone to pick our table up. Ok, I guess. At least it wasn't the servers fault. When we finally order, I ordered their enlightened turkey burger, and asked for our sever (I believe his name was Steve or Steven) to ring it in just as a turkey burger with lettuce, onion, and avocado. My guest ordered the California club. When our food finally arrived, we both take a bite out of it, as we were starving. To our dismay, both of our orders are wrong. My turkey burger is not a turkey burger at all, but a veggie burger. (Granted, this veggie burger was tasty. I definitely recommend for vegetarians.) My guest takes a bite out of her sandwich, which doesn't have the bacon or tomatoes on it it is supposed to have (and that is pictured.) I send my not-turkey burger back and her sandwich. The server apologizes, and we wait. My burger finally arrives, and it is still wrong. The toppings that are supposed to be on the burger, are not. My server goes and gets the toppings that are supposed to be on it and returns a few minutes later. Situation rectified. My guests sandwich finally arrives, with the bacon and tomato, but they didn't replace the sandwich? They bring back the same sandwich with her bite still taken out of it? I'm not sure how sanitary that is that the cooks are touching foods that have been partially eaten and sending it back out!  Although all three mistakes were remedied, I'm severely disappointed a manager did not stop by the table to at least apologize or table tough at all. Our server was not bad, as I'm sure these were errors in the kitchen.

I chose the seared ahi salad off of their lunch menu. The salad was listed as having only 540 calories which made it very attractive in regards to being diet compliant. The salad was quite large in size. It had a lot of what I would call ""foo foo"" lettuce. But it also had avocado, tomato, and other tasty add ins ( including a small dollop of wasabi on each side of the plate). In addition there was a fairly generous amount ahi tuna. Overall, a relatively healthy, fairly dietetic, enjoyable luncheon salad. Combine that with pleasant ambience and excellent service (kudos to Shenna).

136,Jasper h.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,17,,2.0,2015-08-22,"I have been here quite a few times and added a star because the service is great and the beer is solid, however the food is very weak. I first ate a BJs in Southern California about 10 years ago. The deep dish pizza was amazing; hot and fresh and very delicious, as was everything else. Now, the food at this location or perhaps at all locations is extremely subpar compared to what they used to serve. It almost always comes out room temperature and has obviously been pre-prepped and then slightly heated before being served. A deep dish pizza that comes out at room temperature is probably one of the most disappointing experiences a man can go through. However, if you can get the food made fresh, it is still great, but that's the problem. A couple visits back I had a dish that was as stated above, room temp and old. I let them know and they brought me a fresh dish; it was great. This is not how a restaurant should operate; especially not BJs, when the food can be great. I am pretty sure they keep this up because most people just accept it; sad. If you guys get your stuff together and start making the food fresh; let me know and I will give you another shot. Until then, no mas BJs for me.

They have the seating and are usually staffed to handle larger parties. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of televisions so you can take a peek at your favorite game. Their menu is huge and everyone can find something to eat. But there's only a handful of items that I personally would consistently order though. For me, of course I'm a fan of their craft beer. They have a nice selection that runs the spectrum of flavors with the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter being my favorites. You can order a flight if you're having trouble deciding or want to try multiple beers. Their deep dish pizza with the thick, crunchy, and slightly greasy crust has always been pretty consistent. The Pizookies are a must order. A warm cookie with ice cream is a slam dunk. On our most recent visit, I decided to go with the 14 oz. ribeye ($21.50) with brussel sprouts and asparagus. I wouldn't order this again, nor would I recommend it. It wasn't terrible, but for the price, I can get a better, larger steak from the butcher. The brussel sprouts were mush and I couldn't finish them. We finished with the salted caramel pizookie which was delicious and completely annihilated.

Depending on the time of day you arrive, you will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot. One trick we used to do growing up that we still do, is drop one person off at the door to put our name down while the other parks. It saves time!  At BJs, they have a skinny menu that tells you the calories for the items. For those who don't care, there plenty of higher calorie tasty menu items as well- Burgers, Pizza flatbreads, etc BJs has also jumped on the Sriracha band wagon, a favorite hot sauce to us Asians. They have created a Mac and cheese with Sriracha sauce... Amazing! My daughter likes this dish and I have taken several bites off her plate, I do like it. If you want something spicy or have kids that have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is a GoTo. I really enjoy their lower calorie items like the seared Ahi tuna salad or their quinoa bowls. The ahi tuna salad is just fantastic. A large bowl of greens, with dabs of wasabi sauce on the sides of the dish. The ahi tuna is nicely seared and adds a fab protein.

But you can't ding a restaurant just because of that... It means they're doing their job and running this place as it should!  I have never had a complaint about getting greeted every time I walk into BJ's. When it's busy, they give us an honest estimate as to how long we will wait. None of that ""10 minutes"" when they really mean 45 minutes!  Once we get seated our drink orders are taken almost instantly. We have quite some time to look over the menu, we never feel rushed. When you have no idea what to order waiters/waitresses are always recommending and suggesting things.  Food comes out hot and fresh. You never have to wait too long for your food. Approximately between 30-45 minutes, max! I appreciate the waiters tending to our needs and frequently checking up on us.  I never have complaints on cleanliness here. The waiting area, seating area, and bathrooms are always so clean! HUGE plus for me! Excellent customer service! Welcoming and accommodating staff. I would highly recommend this place!  Side note, if you don't know what to order I would suggest:  Appetizers- avocado egg rolls, stuffed mushrooms Main Dish- Cajun chicken pasta, (any flavor) deep dish pizza, or broccoli cheddar soup and/or clam chowder with a bread bowl Dessert- you can never go wrong with a pizookie!

I asked for a manager. She came and apologized and told me there was a allergy alert on the ticket. Idk who's lying here. The waitress already lied to me about not having a problem. The manager came back 10mins later with the correct order. By then my lunch was cold. I had the chicken with rice pilaf and it didn't taste good. Had a few bites and I was done. Not going back again.

They also have different entrees such as burgers, pastas, and more. They have an enlightened healthy menu for those who are on the healthy side. I strongly recommend trying some of their seasonal crafted beers. The athmosphere of place is very moderate, not too loud but not too quiet. There are televisions in about every corner for those who are here for sports. They also have an outside seating area which is perfect when the sun starts to set and the weather gets cool.

Crispy fried shrimp and a ribeye dinner. Waited 20 minutes for a side salad and another 10 for dressing. Waited about 45 minutes for our food. The food was extremely hot from sitting under the heat lamps for so long which made the ""crispy fried shrimp"" taste rubbery. Asked for a refill on drinks when the food arrived (45 minute wait for a refill). Sent the shrimp back, took a box to go for the steak. Ended up paying $40 to watch my husband eat his dinner.

I found five cloth napkins in total on the floor under my table and the surrounding tables ( I counted on my way to the restroom).... I noticed a little extra cushion under my stiletto and my husband stepped on something that poked the bottom of his shoe and that's when he noticed a couple of forks under our table as well. This is when I began to look around and noticed more than I wanted to. Upon picking up the napkins I saw silverware and trash at all of the surrounding booths! We brought it to our waiters  attention and he was highly disappointed. As we finished our meal a bus boy came by to ""clean"" the booth next to ours and we understood! He spent five seconds (literally) wiping down the table with a dirty damp cloth and did a quick swiffer wipe on one seat cushion and neglected the other! He didn't bother to look under the table or properly wipe down the entire seating area... it was a total hit and miss.

However, the food last night was awful, and had I been dining in 2 of my 3 items ordered would have been sent back.  We started with the potato crisp appetizer (basically potato skins). These aren't hard to mess up, but they were so burnt they were not even edible. Literally, fried to a crisp and I couldn't even eat it. Trash, $10.15 out the door - overpriced to begin with now that I'm thinking of it.  My wife ordered sliders with cheese which we were charged $1.25 or something for cheese, which didn't get put on the burger. Since we paid already, nothing we can do. Stupid - I'm sure they do that on purpose to get more $ on to-go orders. Who's going to check for cheese in the car?  I had some shrimp taco thing which was bland as can be. Literally no flavor...so I mean it was the only non-messed up item in our order but yuck. I had asked for sauce on the side, they put it right on the tacos, so actually 3/3 items messed up.

You can choose between fried or grilled topped with some cabbage, pico de gallo and i think it's some kind of aioli. De-lish! My love got fish & chips and the couscous macncheese. Fish was pretty good. Batter just a hair too much for him BUT that couscous was really good! Who would of thunk?? Couscous mac. Garlic chicken pesto pizza. G-double O-D-GOOD! Sisters got boneless Siracha chicken wings and a guac burger (bleh, b/c I'm *cough* allergic to avacado.  And the little cousin got a kids cheese pizza which by the way looked really good and he said, it was delicious  And for desert, pizookie of course. Peanut butter, salted caramel, chocolate chunk, monkey bread pizookie. All were delicious and only $3 on Tuesday for a normal size As for our server, she was awesome.

While waiting, they had posters of different specials they had each day, and I believe their burgers were 50% off one day and they also had $3 pizookies on Tuesdays!  I decided to try their Long Island Ice Tea, and let me tell you - the strongest I've had it so far! Also worth it. Ordered the avocado bacon burger well done and got some fries with it. My mom ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and my uncle ordered a different pasta with shrimp in it but I can't remember the exact name. Service was a little slow but it's understandable because it during a dinner rush!  My uncle had never been to a BJ's restaurant so we ordered the trio pizookie option and got peanut butter, salted caramel, and white chocolate macadamia nut.

42,Stephan C.,"Burbank, CA",132,60,3.0,2.0,2017-09-10,"My friend and I went to the Henderson, NV restaurant on July 20, 2017.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. My friend had the bison burger.  First the sandwich. I come from NY. A club sandwich, aka Triple-Decker has FRESH turkey, bacon, lettuce/tomato with 3 slices of bread and mayo. THAT is a REAL club sandwich. A sliced chicken sandwich from processed chicken as you'd get in a deli on 2 slices of bread is NOT a club sandwich, not now, not ever. I didn't eat it and turned it back, then didn't order anything else. The fries were sparse. The coleslaw.... large chunks of cabbage in a tiny bowl. I make awesome coleslaw at home and have had some of the best coleslaw outside. But this... surely needs to be changed. NEVER use large pieces of cabbage... just as you wouldn't put a thick piece of tomato on a sandwich. This was about the worst I've had. My friend's burger... dried, nothing special.  The waitress was great. Personally, I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant, where everything is tasteless and way over-salted. My fault. We are very disappointed and will not return.  America... Chain restaurants, ala Red Lobster and Olive Garden, use loads of sodium. We all know that no matter how old we are, salt is bad for your heart. If not as a teen, then when you get older. It's a fact. Why chains do this is beyond me. Red Lobster packs their fish in frozen ice salt. Their sauces are way oversalted. This is what they told me. Same for Olive Garden. Salt does not bring out the taste... it eventually hurts your organs. Better to find a mom 'n pop shop, not a corporate chain restaurant. There is no shortage of restaurants. Be wise when you choose. I do not suggest BJ's as your place of choice to eat.. 2 times there and I'm done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=20,3.68,3.84,3.764,3.208,3.776

Very crunchy and little oil. 4.8/5 Avocado egg rolls $11.50 - still prefer the one from Cheesecake but their tamarind sauce is good though 3.5/5 Crispy calamari $11. 50 - pretty much similar to other restaurants but not that oily. 4.2/5 Entrees: -full back pork ribs Thursday promo $17.95 it came with two items and a mini pizookie - worth getting this deal if you happen to come here on Thursday. The sauce amount of sauce was perfectly applied to the ribs and the meat was super tender 4.8/5 -seared ahi salad - $15.95 - my brother ate the meat and I ate the salad. Their rice vinaigrette sauce wasn't that sour 4.4/5 -seafood tacos $10.75 - my brother said the seafood was well marinated and he would give it 4/5 :-).  -steak top sirloin - $16.50 nothing special about this dish 3.8/5 -Shrimp & asparagus pasta - $16.95 - too salty and somehow the flavor wasn't there 3/5 - tavern cut flatbread brew house classic with pineapple - $17.25 must eat it while it still hot but very crunchy. They burned it a little though 3.5/5 - Tavern cut garlic chicken pesto $15.95 - too dry would be better if they have little bit more sauce 3.5/5 -Spaghetti with meatballs $9.99 - my daughter regret that she she ordered this dish.

We were all seeing spots in our eyes for quite a while  from the brightness. We asked to change our table, and the second one was a little better but there was still too much sun filtering through the shades. they have what looks like wooden blinds in the front of the restaurant that they should also put on the side windows.  Our server was very friendly, but severely lacking in being observant and listening. She took drink orders for my husband and son, but didn't ask me if I wanted anything.  I ordered a dinner salad with chicken. Son had a steak and husband had a quinoa bowl. I am a rather slow eater, and my family finished before me. The server came over and asked if we were ready for dessert. I was shocked, as I was clearly still eating. I told her I was still enjoying my salad and she said the pizzookie takes a while, so we should order it even though I was still eating. Well, here I am eating my dinner and less than 5 minutes later the food runner brings this hot cookie topped with ice cream over to our table. I called our server over and told her I was still eating. She asked me if I wanted a box for my salad. I said no, and SHE TOOK IT RIGHT OUT FROM IN FRONT OF ME! MY FORK WAS STILL IN MY HAND!  She also left the check and told us to have a good evening.  When she came back for the check, I told her I was shocked that she insisted we order dessert while I was still eating and that she also took my meal before I was finished. She smiled, asked if I enjoyed it and made no apologies. When I asked for a manager, she said she was new and would get in trouble, left the check for me to sign and we didn't see her again.  My son said while the steak was good, he felt a little queazy after the meal. I enjoyed the salad, but would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to finish it.

The servers and managers were so helpful and friendly and the food was on point! Henderson location is the same! Our server was so attentive and we were in the bar area! Even the guy that gave us our food was so happy and excited.  They never rushed us and they made sure that were attended to. My fish and chips was very crispy and flavorful. The veggie (vegan) was tasty and garnished perfectly! My wife had to have the Poke Salad again and it was just as perfect as before.  We signed up for the app, got a free dessert And started earning points!

We got a salad which was delicious and a fried chicken burger with a spinach dip. Let me start by saying the service was amazing, but ... the fried chicken as funny as that sounds is a beef patty, but that's not the issue, my issue was the patty smelled and tasted funny. We let the waiter know and he jumped to take it out of the bill for us ... which is fine, but honestly I would have much appreciated if he had asked what the issue with it was so it doesn't happen again than just taking it of the bill. It didn't make me feel good to have him not ask what the issue was and follow up on it.  Other than that, the rest of the food and the ambiance was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson,4.0,3.81,3.816,,3.886

77,Bob S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-14,"Kevin Morrison - Manager of BJ's in Henderson is a moron.  I have eaten at the this restaurant about 150 times in three years.  It's a fast fix to mediocre food at cheap corporate prices  when you have a busy business schedule like myself-a step above Burger King, McDonalds and other fast food chains.  Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can't deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn't look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato!  Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds.  Sorry, I requested actual sliced tomato, avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up.  Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would'nt notice).  When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little ""piss ant"" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back!  About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me!  When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him!  It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay.  So much for getting repeat business - they could care less.  Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly.  That's why their turnover is so high.  Steer clear of this place is my advice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=100,3.76,3.76,3.788,,3.76
33,Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524.0,5.0,2017-12-05,"We recently visited this location and had the best experience and most amazing food ever. To start, I thought I'd try the Ahi Poke. What an excellent decision. The Ahi Tuna was a great portion and had soy sauce lightly drizzled on top (you didn't notice it - you only tasted it). It came with about seven cheesy chips and avocado as well as cabbage. I highly recommend this for a quickly-delivered bite to eat while you're trying to find your main course in the menu. For my main course, I had a pizza called ""The Italian Market."" It was amazing. Tasted like pizza from Italy itself. Very little sauce - but you could definitely taste it. Very thin crust - but perfectly cooked so as to not dump your toppings on your lap (and it tasted of a great toasted element). To drink I had BJ's own Root Beer and it was perfect. I'm not a big fan of black licorice and most root beer's leave a black licorice taste in your mouth. This one did not. It left a sweet root taste in your mouth that worked well with the food choices for the evening. Matt served us and he was a great waiter. We were able to download the brand-new BJ's app, pay with it (using Apple Pay) and got a free mini pizookie on our next visit! Needless to say, we'll be back to claim our free mini pizookie and I might just order the exact same thing.

23,Andrew N.,"Henderson, NV",90,27,92.0,3.0,2017-12-20,"Bj's catered my hospital ambassador meeting. They were about 40-45 minutes later than the scheduled delivery time. - Chicken breast was tender and charcoal flavor was not overbearing like some charcoal grilled chicken breast can be from other places. - pizza was warm still, with a crust resembling pizza hut. Less marinara than I prefer, only a thin layer under the toppings. - toppings are plentyful, and of average quality. Crust was soft, not crunchy, probably due to having sat in a warming bag for a while. - ribs were ok, a bit on the dry side. - salad was very basic, with the majority of the lettuce being iceberg (see pic). - meatballs were very soft, mainly due to the large amount of dough rolled into them, resulting in a diluted meat flavor that leaves them fairly bland. - pasta was just boiled pasta, marinara was not very flavorful either. - chicken nuggets could have come from the frozen section of the grocery store. - sausage was just your average sausage with spices. Overall, the best parts of the meal were the pizza and chicken breast in my opinion. I don't intend to go eat there in the future, as there was no food item that I had that was more unique than something you could find at a grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson,3.76,3.77,3.804,,3.766

For dinner I ordered the grilled chicken pasta which was pretty good. My husband ordered the barbecue pulled pork burger which he loved. He said the sauce was complimented by the bacon and cheese. He also had the Grand Cru beer instead of the usual Stella. He said it was very smooth and the rye was perfect. My mom had the classic chicken sandwich which was hot and fresh the chicken was crunchy but tender and juicy inside. A great basic chicken sandwich. The spaghetti was devoured by our 12 year old so it must have been good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson?start=20,3.76,3.76,3.808,,3.76
22,Katherine S.,"Reno, NV",157,1,,2.0,2017-12-28,"I love coming into BJ's, and I came in tonight with my family for my birthday. I work in the restaurant industry, and I was seriously unimpressed with their service and waitstaff. We weren't greeted with a ""welcome"" or ""hello"" by the hostess up front, just her chewing gum with an open mouth. I don't think I saw her smile once. It was a busy night, I understand. But it continued with our server, Lauren. I remembered her name because I was embarrassed for her in regards to her hospitality. Not warm, not friendly, maybe spent 90 seconds total with our table the entire night. She made no effort to be warm or welcoming, and she seemed to be in such a rush that us asking for service was an inconvenience to her.  The food was good! That's what those two stars are for. However, when we ordered a dessert (we were so excited for the pizookies), there was a long black hair in one of them. Mind you, all of the women in our group are very blonde - we knew in no way could it be ours. We let Lauren know, and she took the dessert trio off our tab. She didn't apologize, she wasn't apologetic or accommodating whatsoever besides doing the bare minimum of taking the dessert off our tab.  The manager was friendly and apologetic, but the impression had been made. I work in a restaurant that gets busier than most, easily as busy as BJ's was tonight. Our waitstaff is still warm, friendly, collected, and accommodating. The lack of professionalism at this establishment was impossible to ignore, and the quality of our service had me feeling mortified on Lauren's (and that hostess's, and frankly the entire restaurant's) behalf. I truly hope Lauren was having a really, really bad night, and that she doesn't regularly give this quality of service to other customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henderson,3.8,3.75,3.804,,3.77
