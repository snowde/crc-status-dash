290,Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35.0,2.0,2012-01-08,"Unfortunately I've had better experiences at other BJ's than the experience at this location. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was attentive (it wasn't the service or restaurant that was the issue), but it was the food that was sub-par for what I am used to from BJ's. First, our salads arrived before the appetizer (minor inconvenience and easily overlooked). For an appetizer we ordered the potato skins. There was barely any cheese on them. I'm used to the nice cheesy cast-iron skillet of potato skins and apparently they've changed them to be more 'fancy'. This means they arrive nicely organized on a white plate with barely cooked bacon and no cheese. The ones with cheese tasted okay, but really the rest I took home so that I can add more cheese and eat them later. My Parmesan chicken was all right (the chicken was cooked nice and tender), but the pork chop my husband ordered was like one of the those fake plastic food items you find in kids play kitchens. It was really thin and came with only 4 small red potato halves. Next time we'll avoid the pork chop. Maybe it was an off-night, but I expected better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=300,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.1120000000000005,3.3600000000000003

Dry and not edible by a two year who loves Mac and Cheese. Papaw's Meal: Fish taco of questionable fish origin despite what the menu says.. The tacos was more cabbage then the over cooked fish stick in the tortilla. Nana's meal: 1/2 Turkey sandwich was made with hard bread that fell off the sandwich into pieces as she tried to eat it and served with greasy fries.  BJ's used to be our go to place, but after this lunch fare today not anymore. A $37 lunch that was just a waste of money and a waitstaff that must have been trained to ask you every 5 minutes is everything alright.

The chicken parmesan sandwich for $6.95 with fries is a nice filling portion however, wayyyy too much mayonnaise for them to claim any sort of healthy choice option there.  i like BJs because it has a fun lively atmosphere and the restaurant always looks spic and span clean, but i think the quality of food is mediocre at best. i suppose my expectations are too high; it is just another chain after all.  but maybe my real disappointment came from my table who didn't want to order a pizookie. i'll be back for that---just won't order from the lunch menu or i'll make sure to eat first before eating here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=260,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.2440000000000007,3.2800000000000002

241,Olivia K.,"Houston, TX",406,363,319.0,3.0,2012-11-06,"For a chain brewhouse restaurant, it's pretty good. It's a typical chain with the menu and food preparation, which explains why you can only find them in the suburbs of Houston. Personally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants because they lack originality and uniqueness. I met a blind date here, so it wasn't my choice to drive to the suburbs to eat here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think there was anything outstanding about the food, but it was prepared well with no problems. I'm just not a fan of oversized portions of typical American bar/restaurant food. I'm not a beer drinker and it was too early in the day for me to start drinking, so I opted for one of their in-house crafted sodas and it was amazing! For beer lovers, they do keep St. Arnolds on tap in order to keep the locals coming back, but still offer a full bar as well as bottled beers. The decor is dark and warm with a very swag cigar-smoking type feel, minus the actual smoke. I sat at the bar instead of sitting in the main dining area. I always enjoy sitting at the bar as a means of feeling like there is a different ambiance than being seated amongst the overwhelming number of families that use the main dining area. Being childless means that I'm not tolerant of your screaming baby behind me while I'm trying to eat and carry on a conversation.

Flavorful sauce, tomatoes, red onions, and large chucks of pizza on a thick dough with crispy edges. Delicious! You may have to sit through very mediocre service when you come to BJ's, though. In my experience, the server is either overbearing or doesn't know what to do and messes up the order. Not to mention the wait to be seated! Being on 249 and 1960 this location gets a lot of foot traffic, and I think being next to Whiskey River helps BJ's get customers for their menu of pizza, pasta, and potatoes to soak up all of the.. well, whiskey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=80,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.124,3.8

192,Hillary B.,"Houston, TX",0,11,1.0,1.0,2013-04-29,"I ate here with family yesterday at 2 pm. I am absolutely disgusted with how a simple mistake was handled with the food. Besides being slow (nearly 40 minutes to be seated...well over the 10-15 minute quoted wait time) and having to ask five people for silverware, I had the pleasure of our waitress trying to cover up a burger having cheese instead of getting the kitchen to remake me one without cheese. I had ordered a burger without mayo or dressing (the menu lists a hamburger completely separate from cheeseburgers) and when it came, I checked o make sure it had no dressing. To my surprise, I saw globs of yellow in a corner - it looked like morons had stuck cheese on the burger and then pulled it off when they realized it wasn't supposed to have it on there. Absolutely disgusting. I brought it to her attention and she took it back to the kitchen - I figured that I'd get a new burger...yeah, no. Two minutes later, she's back with the burger, claiming it's ""new"" (I know it takes longer than two minutes to cook that...and taking food from other diner's orders to correct a mistake is rather uncool). Nope. She lied. It was the EXACT burger with a corner cut off. How gross. So customers can't get what they order and when mistakes are made, get the mistake poorly covered up instead of new food? To make matters worse, on the other side of the patty, there's tons of cheese bits. I get the actress again and tell her that its the same burger and there's still cheese all over it. I told her I am allergic to cheese and she's arguing with me that it's ""meat juice"" not cheese. Yeah, no...I know what cheese looks like. Finally she takes it back and I eventually get a burger made correctly. Nothing's comped, I'm disgusted by the way the food was handled (touching MY food that I'm supposed to eat to cut a chunk out instead of getting a new meal made????), and I'm annoyed over how rude/lazy/incompetent our server is. I wish I had spoken to a manager, but I didn't want to make a scene and I just wanted to get out of that place.  I don't understand how someone can mess up like that and then argue with me over it.

I dropped in around 11ish, so there were no children there, but this seems to be a place that you can bring the kiddos w/ no problems.  Their special thing is their own craft beers. I tried the blonde ale which was pretty good. Food wise, I went for the fried wontons Thai style & the Corn & Bacon fritters...YUMMY!!! And for $3 each it was a steal. The dipping sauses for both were really good.  Bartender was really sweet. They let you have a taste of the specialty drafts before you order which is a plus. Chatted it up w/ a couple of folks that seem to be regulars. Very nice vibe to the place. Noticed they hustled to keep the place clean & in order even w/ the busy Saturday crowd.  The menu here is HUGE!! In fact, I think this is the only negative thing I can think of from my 1st run. There's sooo much stuff on the menu, it's almost overwhelming. Perhaps if it was designed better it would be a little more eye catching. You open it & there's just words/food everywhere.  I will be going back to try some other things I saw on the menu.

The staff at BJ's was very accomodating and they moved us over to a small area off to the side and one of the managers stepped up to help take orders and move the dining experience along. It only took 1.5 hours from seating to paying the bill, which for such a large party is a great feat.  Although the service was really good, I can't say that the food was any sort of spectaular, which is what holds my rating back. I ordered the Half sandwich, half soup + fries.  The California Chicken sandwich, which seemed to have an abundance of mayo on it, was decent. I enjoy a dollop of mayo to add some fatty goodness; however, I don't enjoy having globs of it spilling out onto my plate and my fries.  The chicken noodle soup was akin to what I could find in a can, but it still hit the spot and expectations. The chose the shoestring potato fries because I like the crispiness to starch ratio.

Since I no longer struggle with a gluten or dairy sensitivity, I deviated from my usual gluten-free pizza order (great selection here for gluten free folks!!) and settled on the Original Roast Beef Dip sandwich with their wedge-cut seasoned fries. After witnessing my mom's bad experience with the French Dip at La Madeleine, I was nervous to try the French Dip sandwich at BJ's, which isn't a ""French cafe"", but it turns out that I had nothing to be nervous about. BJ's does a way better French Dip than La Madeleine! The roast beef inside the sandwich is juicy and tender, and the French roll is doughy and soft-- a great contrast to the savory beef and caramelized onions that are fun to rip apart with your teeth. The au jus has just the right amount of flavor too. I was really impressed. I had a bite of my grandma's avocado egg rolls, which have always been and STILL are delicious.

I've tried their deep-dish pizzas, Spinach stuffed mushrooms, Gourtmet Mac & Cheese, Louisiana style Pasta, Jumbalaya, Pizookies, and cocktails. -Spinach stuffed mushrooms- I would say it's a 5/5. The sauce is pretty good and they don't drench the mushrooms with the sauce which was a plus. -Gourmet Mac & Cheese- 3/5, I would say it's a little different from the mac and cheese most people imagine. The cheese is on the light side and it's not saucey like most mac and cheese dishes. The presentation of the mac and cheese was really nice but I've had better. -Deep dish pizza- 3/5, the Gourmet five meat pizza is really good but when I think of deep-dish I think of Chicago style deep-dish. The pizza isn't as cheesy but the pizza is good. Meat lovers should try the Gourmet five meat. I've tried their pepperoni pizza and it was average. -Pizookie- 5/5 AMAZING. All of their pizookies are good. However, the triple chocolate is definitely for chocolate lovers. SO sweet and very chocolate-y/. I usually stick with Cookies and cream and White Macadamia nut pizookie. Red velvet is pretty good, too. You can sample 3 pizookies for  $10.  -Jack lemonade is pretty good. Definitely sweet with a hint of Jack.  -Louisiana style pasta/ Jumbalaya-  3/5.

263,Ronald M.,"Cypress, TX",0,5,15.0,1.0,2014-02-18,"Where do I start? Let me say first that the food and service has always been very good. Brought my family here last weekend a party of 6 adults and 1 baby, told the hostess what we needed, that 2 adults & baby had not shown up yet they seated us in a large booth. When the rest of the party showed up we had already ordered drinks & appetizers she saw that we needed a high chair and said they are not allowed to have a high chair at the booth, that's fine but instead of reseating us at a open table they said it was spoken for & they were going to make us get up and wait on another table so we went and got the car seat and stayed in booth with car seat stuffed in between us. Now the food...we ordered beers everyone except one were brought their drinks, after 5 minutes we told waiter we were short 1 beer he said he would check after 5 more minutes we reminded him again he then said they were out of the brand ordered. At what point was he going to tell us!!!! Remember the appetizers I mentioned? We ordered a spinach artichoke dip and when it came out we grabbed some chips and were HORRIFIED!! To find an old dried up lemon wedge in the chips!!! Are they putting used chips back in the chip bin???!!! Do not know why at this point we just didn't get up and leave?? We we ordered burgers and steaks and nothing was cooked to ordered!!! Needless to say I WILL NOT!! Be back...WHAT HAPPENED??? Oh yeah they were not that busy when we went.

When I got there, I had to park in the back because there was no available parking. I walked in and the greet was awkward. Almost like they were forced to greet me. Mannerisms speak loudly. The place was packed. I was seated in a dining area in the two seater booth. My waitress came about ten minutes later to take my order. It was a fair wait because the menu was huge. When the waitress greeted me, I told her it was my first time there. I told her I was interested in the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. She said it was great. So I paired it with a Chardonnay and a house salad. I asked for no cheese on the salad and it came immediately with no cheese (the little victories). Perfect size before meal-not too much and not too little. I should've asked for dressing on the side, because it was a bit much. It didn't matter so much because I was hungry. In the midst of my salad, my entree arrived by a new server who was just as nice as the waitress. She asked if I had everything I needed. I mentioned I was waiting on my glass of Chardonnay to be delivered. She went to to check on it. Within the minute, my beautiful glass of wine arrived. Served was two pita tacos and a relish type looking side with beans, corn, seeds, quinoa, oil and spices, cucumber, green peppers, cilantro and barley. There was also a yogurt based sauce for the tacos. The tacos included grilled chicken, feta cheese, cilantro and maybe some veggies. The pairing of Chardonnay was perfect! With a packed restaurant, that has been the best service and food I have had since moving here four weeks ago. Outstanding service was provided to a complete single stranger in town for business.

86,Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,264.0,3.0,2014-05-14,"It's your basic Applebee's, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday clone with some specialty brews. My review should just end there. Anyone who knows those places knows there will be burgers and some fancy overpriced salads and some fried apps. And that's what the menu consists of once you get past the hundred pages of specialty drinks in the front of the menu. I had the basic margarita and it was very sour. I think they need to adjust their mix a bit. Margaritas should be limey tart goodness...but not too puckery. I have tried their brews at another location. If you like craft beers these are pretty decent. You know what you like so sit at the bar and ask for a taste. They'll give you a small glass before you order a pint. The little sliders were your basic tiny buns and tiny meat with some really good pickles. The French Dip was a basic Sammy, nothing to write here about. The thing that really made this place feel pedestrian was my salad. They had what looked like a tasty new salad on the menu: Kale and Brussels sprouts.  Here's the outline: Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette.  The waitress brought it to me. I love Brussels sprouts and couldn't wait. I dug around in the thing and there were no Brussels sprouts anywhere. I don't remember seeing blueberries or cranberries either. I told her there were missing parts and she took it away. She came back and said she was sorry they were ""out of Brussels sprouts. But they would be happy to make me something else"". Most of my party was halfway done with their meals and I just told her to take it off our bill. She did.  But really? You brought me a specialty salad with Brussels sprouts in the main description on the menu and the kitchen said nothing about not adding them? It wasn't her fault. It was the kitchen managers fault. Kinda like ordering a bacon cheeseburger and having it come out without the bacon and yet they still charge you for the bacon cheeseburger. Not cool. The place is really loud. If you come in with a large party of 5 or 6 and they steer you toward a horseshoe booth ask if they have a table.

But it's not like super stand out either. I had a chicken dish that was very flavorful...it was a crusted parmesan with a nice sauce. Service was very good. Staff were friendly. Where it kinda goes wrong is with the beer. I'm a beer snob, I'll admit. I've had everything from Heady Topper to MGD, and I know how to make every style, and have tasted some of the best of each. Their beers are just OK. What makes it worse is the knowledge of the staff. First, you're not supposed to touch the tap to the glass, nor overfill above the tap. But that's a minor infraction. Where it gets worse is when you have no clue how to serve the varieties you offer. My IPA was served in a pilsner glass. That's the very tall, narrow, V shaped glass. Which totally KILLS the hoppy aromas of an IPA. You can't properly immerse your nose in them, like with a proper tulip or IPA glass.  Then I decided to get a Paulaner Hefeweizen instead, as they had it on draft, and I figured that would be better. It was not served in the tall, curvy ""Weißbier"" glass, but in a standard American pint glass instead. Again, the glass design enhances the beer - most places that serve Hefeweizen, that claim to be brewpubs, and make the motions would know these things. A Hefeweizen glass has the curves to catch sediments and the yeast, and also enhances the aromas of that style beer. I asked the bartender about it and he sheepishly admitted they only had the two types of glasses; he genuinely seemed ashamed that someone had called them out on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=140,4.08,3.62,3.62,2.8920000000000003,3.8040000000000003

Huge place, always busy for dinner, but you'll never find yourself screaming at others for them to hear you.  Seating is comfortable, waiters are friendly, but sort of absent when it gets busier.  Full bar, they offer beer flights, decent lunch specials, and have a HUGE dinner menu. I don't think anyone could NOT find something to eat here. When I don't feel like anything greasy, I get a salad. Their salads are delicious here people. Delicious and huge, but definitely not calorie friendly if that's what you're going for. However I do believe they have a list of low-cal items on the menu, which is some sort of grilled (frozen) protein and a heaping serving of (frozen) steamed veggies.  Come on, it's BJ's, it's not going to knock your socks off, but you're certainly not going to be disappointed that you came. I've never had a bad experience personally.  Gluten Freers: Rejoice! This is the best, readily available, casual restaurant gluten free pizza out there (the upper scale pizza award goes to Coal Vines). Did I also mention it is a giant pie, and reheats (baked) well?

Second, we end up sitting at a regular table and not making a fuss even though we can still see the two open booths. But the real problem began when our waitress introduced herself.

Lady, I couldn't have said it better myself.  I worked in retail in college.. I know what it's like to work with the public. You catch more bees with honey than vinegar. The final straw was the mix up on our food. My husband ordered a salad to come out before his meal. 25 minutes after ordering... here comes our meal. No salad. So he stops another server because of course we can't find ours and the guy disappears. Here comes the hostess asking what type of salad it was.. 10 minutes later, meals are finished.. here comes the waitress asking what kind of salad it was? No I'm sorry.. No discount on our meal.. Nope. Just some lousy excuse that it was put in a to go box and misplaced. Okay. Sure. Not buying this excuse. Just own up to forgetting to put it in for the order.

I don't wanna be too harsh, but a few points stand out to me: The food isn't always warm. Side dishes such as roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes, and even main dishes such as the chicken or mahi-mahi tend to be room temperature when they arrive. Dishes which are not are usually things like pizza or soups. My asparagus was also not crunchy but really soggy. I'd be okay if it was a rare occurrence but I've come here a few times during dinner and this seems to be rather common. The appetizers are great, and usually more reliably ""fresh"" -- but the main courses tend to be lukewarm at best. Refills on drinks are alright; they're not the speediest but I'm not crunching ice until the end of my meal. I get that this place is busy, though, so I'm not too bothered by that. They do pretty well considering that, but it could definitely be a lot better.  Service is otherwise incredibly friendly. They definitely seem attentive and do well checking up. What I love about this place is the spinach artichoke dip and their famous pizookies.

It wasn't a light blend of olive oil.. more like drenched in oil, but ironically the pasta was bland and tasteless. I remember when it used to be so flavorful, but the past few times, it's been consistently bad and oily. The bread crumbs aren't even crispy.

Let's be honest, we didn't come for the food, we came for the on tap root beer.  There's something about that on tap root beer that makes life feel ok.  We ordered and waited for our food to arrive. I got the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and I also ordered the italian market salad.  Our entrees came out and I let the server know that we never received our salads.  She came back with them in a few seconds and I was a bit disappointed because I was then overwhelmed by food.  I dug into the salad and it was limp, soggy and really lackluster at best.  What happened I think is they were made and sat back there with the dressing on them until she brought them out at least 15 minutes after they were made; judging by the sogginess level.  The bonesless wings were just ok but, the bleu cheese dressing was phenomenal.  The wings were only half coated in sauce and really looked like tiny chicken nuggets.  Also, the portion size was at least a pound which I find unnecessary.

Like all restaurants on Saturday, the place was packed and we had a party of 7 meeting. Three of our family members were already there when we walked in and were waiting. The hostess told us that they could not sit us until the whole party showed up, no big deal since I'm familiar with other places that have this policy. Then another snooty waiter guy told me that they could sit us if half of our party was there. Um, there were 5 people there out of 7! and they still did not seat us. (And yet larger parties than us were seated before we were, even though their entire party wasn't there-we noticed more people arriving after they were seated)  I did not want to get upset since it was a special occasion, so when that snarky waiter guy told us that and yet still did not seat us even though more than half of the party was there, I was just like ""Jesus, take the wheel!!"" We were just waiting on 2 others which were a few minutes away. Finally, our remaining party guests showed up and then a good 10 minutes later, they finally sat us down. Not a good first impression already.  When we were finally seated, the evening seemed to be turning up. Our waitress was really nice and on top of her game, and brought out our drinks super fast. I noticed that they have a large menu with typical items that you'd find in other chain restaurants, ribs, burgers, salads, pizzas, etc. During this visit, I wasn't feeling a beer, so I opted for a strawberry mojito, which for almost $10, was not strong at all. For our entrees, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos $9.95 (comes with mixed grains bowl) the bf ordered the mushroom burger with french fries. The rest of the family ordered, a southern fried chicken plate, vegetable penne, New Orleans Jambalaya and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  To be fair, my food was good, no complaints and the other dishes at the table looked very tasty but to me, the food wasn't  OHMYGODTHISISSOGOOD!! It was just ok. Nothing that will make me drive all the way back. Some of our family members ordered a few of their brewed beers and they all said they were really good but I did not try them during my visit. At the end of our meal, they were accommodating and brought out a special dessert that were ordered discreetly for the birthday boy. As I mentioned, our waitress was a doll. For the life of me, I can't remember her name but she was awesome, stayed on top of our drinks and checked up on us regularly. For me and the bf, our total was $59 (excluding tip for our awesome waitress) but to me, that's overpriced for 2 entrees a few drinks and one birthday dessert. Not worth it to me.

We ordered boneless wings, Brussel sprouts, and has traditional wings as well.

She met our needs and even provided us with a complimentary dessert. We had a child with us, and sometimes children take a long time to decide what it is that they want, but she was very patient.

Because I'm such a regular my points add up very quickly and I'm always looking to try new things on their menu.  If you aren't a big alcohol drinker but don't want water, I recommend the raspberry tea. It come in a cup with a sugar rim. Love the sweetness of it, you can also ask for them to make it more sweet or less sweet since it's regular tea with raspberry syrup.  Appetizers i recommend is the southwest rolls or if you are looking for simple you can't go wrong with the calamari or cheese sticks. My usuals are Atlantic salmon with extra butter sauce, clam chowder, or pasta. The salmon is amazing with the rice and butter sauce. It's a great compliment to the meal and is super filling. The clam chowder can be a bit salty, but it's still very yummy for a sick day. You can never go wrong with pasta.  Some sides I like are the thin cut fries if you are looking to eat a burger. Mash potatoes are great as well, amazingly seasoned to compliment my taste buds.  They're known for great dessert as well, so just give them a try if you are still hungry after the meal. Pazookis are as good as they are hyped. I recommend salted caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston,3.2,3.41,3.532,3.2840000000000003,3.326

If it wasn't bad enough I had to soak up the sauce myself from our table and my belongings, it took the manager over 10 minutes to come by. He was very unsympathetic and offered to buy the plate the soy sauce was spilled from then walked away. I was left with my pants soaking wet and feeling irrelevant.

6,Leah G.,"San Diego, CA",61,54,4.0,1.0,2017-02-12,"Since my 82 year old mom is not an active Yelper, I will act as her proxy.  This is a long review, so be forewarned.   My 82 year old mom and 7 of her 80+ year old friends from Sunday School decided to have their regular Sunday lunch at BJ's on 1960 today.  She was happy to tell me how kind the young gentleman was that waited on them, but how upset she was at the end of the meal.   The young waiter had allowed 4 of the elderly women to order off the children's menu.  Either they asked, or he offered, but none the less, he allowed them to order from that list.  Meal came, meal was enjoyed, and the bill came.  The bill was delivered by Sarah, the manager.  As she gave the bill to the women, she announced that from now on they could not come in there and order from the children's menu.  She first announced it from one end of the table, and just in case they missed it, she proceeded to the other end and REannounced it again.  Not only did the ladies hear it the first time, so did the other patrons in the crowded restaurant. (Some of which they knew from church) This not only embarrassed the ladies, but insulted them greatly.  In front of a crowded restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, the ladies were horrified at the encounter. My mother,  a STRONG Texas lady, was tempted to set Sarah straight, but trying to not add anymore anxiety to the event, held her tongue and left.  She did, however, do what consumers of her generation do and fired off snail mail letters to the local restaurant and one to the CEO and CMO at the Huntington Beach, CA headquarters.  (She may not use social media, but she does know how to Google!) So BJ's may not care about losing the business of 8 elderly women, but those women have kids and grandkids, with more discretionary income, that live all over the US.  And for this San Diego Yelper, who lives down the street from BJ's and eats out about 20 times a month, I will not be going back unless my mom or I get a response on how this situation and future situations like this have been addressed.  (May I suggest a customer service for Seniors training course!) In this age of the ""Graying of America"", consumer focused, hospitality businesses need to realize that our senior community cannot be treated like second class citizens.  They have the money and the time to enjoy these amenities and will frequent those that are gracious to them.  They are a loyal demographic and should be welcomed, not chastised.  There are plenty of competitors of yours that offer seniors special deals or menus, the least you can do is be kind. And lastly BJ's I am borrowing this quote: ""Good Lord willing, you too will be a senior one day; whatever age that may be. And you too will want to be treated with patience, understanding and, most of all, respect.""   I am sure that Greg Trojan, Kevin Mayer and Lon Ledwith will agree. UPDATED 2/13/17 After the kind and thoughtful reply from BJ's Management (which came Sunday evening, I was impressed) I am hopeful that BJ's is taking this situation seriously and will do all they can to resolve the customer service situation quickly and professionally. Thank you BJ's, I hope after some follow up, I will be able to be back and positively reviewing your food and nothing negative!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20,3.12,3.39,3.512,2.6920000000000006,3.282

All of our servers have been fantastic, but there is one hostess that bears this attitude that she either doesn't want to be bothered or seating folks is inconvenient. Here lies the minus one star rating for FOH service or lack thereof. If really busy the hostesses will text you when your table is ready. You can also join a rewards program, ask your server for details! Despite that unfortunate hostess greeting, I think the food is pretty fantastic. The Wednesday Burger Special ($10, any burger) is completely worth it. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect and pink! Fries are double fried and crispy, not greasy. The chicken lettuce wraps are a great appetizer or nice for a light meal. If you like beer, there's a plethora on tap and you can get a flight (4-sampler) for under $10.  I really liked the Tatonka (dark beer). There's a large menu with something for everyone and it feels more upscale than some of the surrounding eateries. My only other frustration is the narrow parking. We ARE in Texas folks!

I had dinner on a Wednesday night, I was surprised to see that this restaurant only had 3 stars but it was packed. Definitely a lot of people were dining here. Upon entering, the place had a slightly stinky smell to it.. maybe dirty mop water? Anyway, it didn't deter us from leaving yet lol. We ordered a chicken bacon ranch mini pizza, creamy mac n cheese couscous, Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl, and honey crisp chicken salad. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese. It was completely different than how I had it in Fort Collins and that was because it was crisply baked in the oven. It tasted just a bit under cooked. The quinoa bowl was mushy due to the tomatoes in the quinoa. The shrimp had good flavor though. The pizza was really good and the salad was good also.  I also ordered the gluten free mini pizookie, so good. Hopefully I don't get salmonella because it was slightly under baked.. just slightly but was still good.

Tonight, however, defied all good impressions I once had on this restaurant.  When we put our name down for a table we were told it'd be a 15-20 minute wait. 25 minutes passed so I went to the counter to check on the status of the table. 3 people were behind the computer talking amongst themselves, obviously not caring if I heard because one of them said ""she's only been waiting 25 minutes"" (only??). Then I said we were told 15-20 minutes and the server argued back and said ""actually we told you 30-45 minutes and it's only been 25 minutes"".  Good management is to never talk back to a customer and to make everyone feel welcome (neither happened).  Finally, we get seated. The waiter made the whole experience so much worse for us. We were a party of 9 and he was constantly forgetting things, like to take someone's order at the other end of the table or to bring our drinks. We'd ask for a fork or an extra plate and never get them, so we'd have to share forks or seek another waiter to get plates. He brought out my fiance's meal before our appetizers, and before everyone else's meals/appetizer so it was awkward for him to eat alone. Then, he spilled water all over my fiancé and cleaned it up so poorly that I had to take the towel from him and clean it myself. We heard a loud thump a few minutes later and it was our waiter who dropped all our pizookies on the ground! It's time for the check and we realize ours was very cheap, and we were thinking ""wow, he comped our meal for us!"" But no, he just accidentally placed them on someone else's tab.  All in all it was a pretty disappointing night. I hope management reads this because I don't want anyone else to experience this kind of service again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston,3.32,3.4,3.48,2.244,3.3680000000000003

This may be TMI but the potatoes had a very distinct rotten milk smell when it came out and I did not have any dairy product today either. I brought this to the attention of the waiter (he was still tipped very well for his service, for he was very friendly) who notified the manager who seemed to put the blame on food poisoning from something I had eaten earlier today and didn't have the decency to check on me personally.

When I called, a gentleman told me that they could not make a reservation because they have to be made 24 hrs in advance (I called at 2/3pm).  Knowing you have a possible 8-9 people coming for dinner, you would think they would be more accommodating and make an exception since a party this size means a solid bill. When I asked the gentleman for more help, he put me on hold to ""talk to his manager"", came back and said that they could only do a call ahead for us. He stated the call ahead wouldn't guarantee us a table. I declined the offer and took my business elsewhere to another restaurant that was much more accommodating.

Never had a long wait or bad service. Maybe because we never had a party larger than 6. Sit at the bar or in the bar area and the service is great. Good but not outstanding food. Better than usual fare for a chain, very decent brews of their own along with guest beers. I like the nutty brunette and the stout. They had one of my favorite beers as a guest beer. Rogue dead guy ale. We shared appetizers, avacado egg rolls were delicious and filling. The roasted Brussel sprouts with sriracha sauce are outstanding and healthy. The calamari was a bit over cooked. Salmon tacos exceeded my expectations. Very consistent no matter the location.

69,Kristin A.,"Spring, TX",3,71,6.0,2.0,2017-11-10,"My wife and I went to BJ's today for the first time. She is a veteran and was going for the free entree offer for vets (up to $12.95 value). We opened the menu and were surprised to discover that despite the fact that my wife was supposed to get a free entree, we would still have to pay something for hers, because practically none of the entrees cost less than $13. The food was overpriced for glorified bar food at what is basically a gastropub. I think we saw two salads under that amount, and since she isn't a rabbit, she ordered a $13.75 burger. I ordered the supposedly deep dish ziti for $14.95.  The food arrived after a long time, and we received another rude surprise: the small food quantities, particularly that of my pasta. I have never gotten so little pasta and paid so much for it. My ""deep dish"" ziti was only half full in a dish the width of a salad plate. I'm a small woman with only a modest appetite, and the portion was so small I ate the whole thing! I have never ordered pasta at a restaurant and not brought home at least half of it. My wife ordered a buffalo brisket burger and the patty was small compared to the bun and the cheese was pretty skimpy as well.  I will credit BJ's for friendly prompt service when we went (4PM on a Friday,) and the food was quite good.

On both visits, the service was very good with everybody in the Astros frenzied spirit. During our first visit we enjoyed a variety of appetizers including buffalo wings and calamari. Our second visit was Halloween night - stay home and dole out treats or go out and cheer on the Astros? No dilemma here! On this night my wife enjoyed wings again (they were quite good first visit and she's been on a bit of a wings kick lately). I noticed that BJ's offers prime rib (a favorite of mine) but only on weekends. Bummer. So I opted for the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite flavorful. We topped off our meal by sharing a chocolate chunk pizcookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum!
