Such a great value. Super delish cheap small plates. I know all you haters hate chains but this one is really legit. I wish they would make it out here to Chicago!!!! I would give my left arm for access to a BJ's California Burger on a regular basis. Well not MY left arm, possibly somebody else's left arm would be better.  BJ's pizza's are great but I would stay away from the wheat crust. Come on... Seriously... You're eating pizza.. If you get the wheat crust you will say to yourself...

321,Britt P.,"San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,2012-03-23,"We've been here several times and the service at this particular location has been TERRIBLE every time.  Drinks and food take forever to get delivered.  It seems like they're chronically understaffed, and the waitstaff makes excuses instead of apologizing. Knowing this, tonight we decided to try and circumvent this problem by simply phoning in an order.  This time took the cake. After being on hold for seven minutes, we had my mom call in to see if she could talk to someone.  The host picked up, and told her that she would have to wait on hold.  My mom asked how many people were on hold ahead of her.  The host said nobody was.  Are you kidding? This location does not deserve your business. These problems seem to be specific to this location -- I've been to others and have never had terrible service like this.  But we'll never return to this location and strongly encourage others who don't want to put up with such terrible service to do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=360,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.2760000000000002,3.3600000000000003

I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and was seated at a table in the back room that had a high chair waiting for me. Scott came over and let me know that he would be taking care of me. He promptly brought over water for my son and I.  He was super friendly and helpful with helping me choose what to eat. We had the mozzarella flatbread to start which was yummy and then I had the Santa fe salad with blackened shrimp. The salad was delicious and I was very happy with my choice. Throughout our meal, a manager and a couple other servers asked how i was doing and even helped to pick up the car my son had thrown on the floor. When i was done with my salad, Scott of course suggested a delicious pizooki and we took him up on his offer and treated ourselves to a mini peanut butter cookie one. Delicious.

297,Christine S.,"Monterey, CA",12,10,,2.0,2012-05-07,"They only get a second star because my friend really liked his meal. I've heard nothing but rave reviews about this place and my friend loves it. I took him to dinner here last night and he went crazy over the Caesar Salad with Salmon. I got a Rib Eye and requested it to be cooked medium rare - it came out almost completely burnt. It reminded me of the crappy steaks I got at Sizzler as a kid for 9.95 (only I paid nearly $20 for this disappointment). The side of mashed potatoes was marginal at best, it had to be flakes because I've never seen potatoes that white, naturally. The skewered shrimp was way overcooked to the point of rubbery and they waited until the end of the meal to refill my water, even though I asked at least a half dozen times, throughout the hour I was there to get it filled. My friend also ordered rolls that came out after he finished his salad.  We sat outside and the heater we were next to was turned off, we kept telling the staff that it was off and they insisted it was on (without actually looking up to check) and finally a busboy helped us turn it on so that we weren't freezing during the whole meal. The waiter kept apologizing for forgetting so much stuff and being inattentive, but I still had to pay the full bill. Quit apologizing for bad service and do something about it instead. My experience was abysmal and they weren't that busy, none of this should have occurred. I will never return to this establishment.

This is by the pier so it tends to be packed. We decided to go with the avocado egg roll appetizer. These are always good especially since we were hungry.As far as dinner, I wanted to try something other than the pizza. Decided to go for the scampi shrimp pasta. I was surprised by the amount of pasta they gave me. Huge portion. The pasta was alright but was lacking some kind of sauce. It tasted kind of dry. The shrimp tasted pretty fresh though.

408,R G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,,2.0,2012-07-20,i had the worst service at this Bjs. I came here to have an early dinner with a friend and figured sitting outside would be nice since it's summertime. We got sat in a squished corner when there was obviously open tables all around. Then it took our server like ten minutes to greet us and by that time we both were ready to order. So we ordered a water and sprite along with dinner salads and mac n cheese. We ended up almost finishing our salads before getting our drinks and when the mac n cheese came it was already cold.

406,J. W.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,2012-08-14,"Where do I begin?!  Here are the facts: Checked in with the hostess to get a spot for the patio and waited in the bar. The tables were dirty-glasses, plates, etc. while we sat for 10 min-nobody came by or even looked at us to say they would be right over, or offer to clean the table. I then asked a busser if we had to order at the bar and he said somebody would be over. 5 min later we were paged for our table on the patio-except it wasn't on the patio so we went back to the table to wait.  5 more minutes go by and nobody comes or acknowledges us. I stand up with my credit card to get drinks and a server immediately comes over to get our drink order-so after we placed the order, you guested it! we waited another 5 minutes for drinks-so we are at about 25 min so far for our 1st drink to arrive. We order food immediately and once we get it there is no silverware, napkins, etc. Sooo we have to get it ourselves. Nobody follows up with us until we flag another server down to get another round of drinks, and then another to get our bill. About 10 more things went wrong too but I just don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place.

290,Mathew R.,"Newport Beach, CA",134,212,22.0,4.0,2012-08-26,"We went here for lunch today and sat outside on the patio to eat. I ordered the Ceasar salad. The food came out pretty fast, and considering all the people there it was quite impressive. Our waitress was very nice and made sure everything was good to go. The salad was really good, I added the blackened chick to it and the portion of the salad is just the right size, not over fed at all which a lot of places have been doing this lately. If you sign up for their rewards card you get a free cookie with some ice cream on top as a reward for signing up with them. It's a points related rewards account that you can ask them to give you a physical card, or you can go to their website and sign up as you're waiting for your food is what we did. After the lunch we got the free desert which tasted great. The cookie was Oreo, and it was topped with ice cream and a cookie flavored whipped topping which tasted great! Eating here, and enjoying the nice weather while people watching and having a great conversation with my girlfriend was a perfect little lunch date for us. She ordered a pizza which she then took some home with us for her to much on later. She loved the pizza, and has eaten here before but since I am new to the area I haven't, but glad I did. Try this place out, gorgeous area to eat a nice lunch or dinner in. They also had a brunch menu that you can choose some other food choices that aren't on the regular menu, it's just for Sunday Brunch. The menu looked pretty good but I didn't decide to get anything off the brunch menu this time.

Being the Duke of the huntington beach location illustrates how often I come here. I do live 2 blocks away. That said, I will be relinquishing my crown. Here are my reasons, which will all involve food since I've always overlooked the hit and miss servers.  1. They changed the freaking pizza! No longer is it deep dish, but just hand tossed. They got rid of the deep dish tins... This is the biggest WTF moment. This is the reason people come here and makes this place unique. What was management thinking? The servers told me HB was the last holdout for the deepdish tins.  If that's the case, I'm sorry to all the other locations as well. 2. Wheat crust on the veggie pizza is no more. (I'm sure I'm the only one that cares.)  3. They got rid of the oatmeal raisin pizookie!?  So a big FU to the minds at Bj's. Again, I relinquish the crown. Too many other good pizza joints in hb, and bjs just gave up their signature pizza, the ""California deep dish"" in favor of handtossed.   If you're looking for a handtossed pizza in HB, take a look at pizza lounge or Luggattis or papp joes.  Cheaper and better.

They do validate parking, but the parking is pretty bad since it is by the beach. Also, the service was...interesting. I had a fly in my drink and thought it was very noticeable but it was brushed off as not being a big deal. I then ordered a cheese pizza. However, the waiter thought I said 5 meat. So, the serve brought out the pizza and I said it wasn't mine. He then went to the back and brought it out and said it was mine and brought the waiter out to tell me it was mine. I told him what I ordered and he said that item didn't exist  (I saw it on there and have gotten it at other BJs in the past). After telling him I saw it on the menu, he left a little frustrated and carless and came back to tell me it would be out soon. When it did come out it wasn't good very well.  It is also very, very loud so you can't hear what someone is saying unless they are next to you. I give it 2 stars because I was with a medium sized party and people make mistakes. Also the rest of my part liked their food and didn't have any problems. I just don't like being told I'm wrong multiple times when I say I saw something on the menu.

Unfriendly, unwelcoming, and undeserving of minimum wage. The management? Incompetent.  Overall? Be glad I gave you one star, and against my will, at that. I called in an order one night, it was specifically 3 large pizookies. Not that difficult right? After telling me on the phone it would be ready in about 20 minutes, I ambled on down from the beach bonfire that I was at to go pick up the pizookies. Now mind you, this beach bonfire was for my friend's birthday, and we all forgot to buy a cake so we decided to get some pizookies as an alternative. After reaching BJ's, I walk up to the hostess bar and tell them my situation and they look through some receipts(?) looking for my order. They just kind of stammer and say it will be a couple more minutes. Uh, ok, sure, I came about 10 minutes later than you advised to avoid exactly this, but it's not a problem. So I'm standing there against the wall watching T.V. because I left my phone back at the beach, thinking it would only take 10 minutes, MAX. 20 minutes go by and nothing. I go up to the hostess bar and ask how much longer it would take and they give me a vague response full of excuses, ""The kitchen is busy,"" ""The pizookies are being baked fresh,"" ""It's coming right out."" Ok, I'll wait a little longer. I waited about 25 minutes, plus the added 25 minutes they told me it would take over the phone, it can't take that much longer right? WRONG. To make a long story short, I waited a little over 2 hours for my order to come out. By that time I was visibly steaming. Turns out they forgot my order, put in an order, gave my order to the wrong customers (what, is it that difficult to verify a NAME on an order?) and after all that decided to have me just wait there instead of doing anything about it. Now I understand mistakes are a part of human nature, and I'm willing to forgive them for my time wasted. But the thing that really set me off was the way they all tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal and that I was blowing it out of proportion.

I arrived at 8pm and went to the front desk to check the status on our tables, the hostess said maybe another 5-20 minutes. I thought OK that's not too bad. Here comes 8:30 and now my guests are all standing outside waiting to go. I went back to the hostess and she said ""you can go back there they are just cleaning the tables"" ok so you want us to stand there while they clean the tables? Awesome!

Our starters came out before our main course and then about thirty seconds after the appetizers came out, our lunch came out. Bad timing on the kitchen's end but it happens.  Anyway, the Ahi Poke needed... flavor. I DUMPED salt on it. It helped, but obviously it's BJ's so how good could the Ahi Poke REALLY be?! I also didn't care for the mini bruschetta either - the little bread it came on was too thick so it was hard to bite and then the toppings fell off.  I guess the breakfast sandwich was fine - it's kind of difficult to mess THAT up... and my fish tacos were just aiight. Not too much flavor..

Many of their menu items are non-standard in that they have customized typical dishes to have more flavor and character. My favorite entree is the Moroccan Spiced Salmon served with Sauteed Vegetable CousCous covered with a tasty, mildly spicy, Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. Of course, all of their Pizzas are excellent. Even my old standby, the Classic Combo (Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushroom), is extremely satisfying. Their full bar has everything you can imagine and they have several unique beers on tap as well. Service is always friendly and efficient. My only complaint is the noise level. When the restaurant is full it is hard to carry on a conversation with your dinner mates as it is just too loud.

For appetizers, the hot wings were nothing special, but still satisfying. I did enjoy the fried calamari; it had a great texture/taste and it was hard to put down. I also got a mini-deep dish pizza, which also was exactly what I would have expected.  Overall, I will probably return if I have no where else to go, but there are plenty of options on Main Street and BJ's didn't offer anything that stands out in my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=160,2.96,3.02,3.02,2.8640000000000003,2.9960000000000004

It was very busy on Sunday, but the food was great, service was good too. I enjoyed the roast beef dip sandwich (4*) one night and the  following night I had chicken strips (4*) - the chicken was great, but the mashed potatoes were cold. Their Desserts are awesome!  I had the BJ's Baked Beignet one night and the next night I tried Apple Berry Burst Crumble.  Both were 5*  The only problem is the ice cream melts too fast because both dishes are served hot, but they were sure delish!

Then when the second pizza came, the waitress took the remainder of the first pizza to box for us to take home (it was actually a very good pizza) and we started on the new one.

The waitress brought the bill only to see that we were charged for all five meals. I had to remind her of what the manager said so she proceeded to bring the bill back with the two meals removed. As far as I am concerned they should have comped the entire bill since my 3 other family members had to sit and wait for us to finish our meal. Never saw the manager again.

166,Tiffany L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",178,68,16.0,2.0,2014-06-21,"I've never had a terrible experience at ANY BJ's restaurant until I came here.  A couple friends and I were seated after waiting 20 or so minutes on a Friday night. Our server brought our drink after being seated for a couple minutes. We ordered three appetizers: potato skins, traditional wings, and spinach and artichoke dip. Being super hungry, we were excitedly waiting for our appetizers!  We waited between 30-40 MINUTES just the appetizers alone. We watched in agony as tables around us received their appetizers AND meals. Our server barely acknowledged us for the first 20 minutes. Then after, she came to our table and asked us if we got our appetizers when it was very obvious that we didn't since the appetizer plates was stacked exactly how she left it. Isn't it her responsibility to know? But no! She told us she didn't know what happened, and then left to care for other customers. If you don't know what happened, figure it out and put in another order. A simple explanation could be nice. It's reasonable if maybe another server took our food by mistake; my table won't be mad but just let us know instead of ""I don't know what happened"". But thanks for reassuring me that you don't know what you are doing.  The manager eventually came to our table and told us he didn't know what happened either. Sigh....  but thank goodness he brought it out after 5 more minutes. He also made it on the house to make up for the long wait.  We were about 75 percent done with the appetizers when they brought out pizookies. We ordered them in advance and told them to bring it out after our meal. We had to stop the appetizers, no way I was letting the ice cream melt! After I finished the pizookie, I finished my appetizers. This is probably the weirdest dinner sequence I've ever experienced. The whole timing of the night was very off. We received our appetizers late, but our pizookies early.

I was truly impressed by the swift reply to my initial feedback. Despite this, a person named Jesse reached out to me after I was disappointed with a recent experience. He wanted to make things right by offering me a courtesy card. In order to do so I provided him with personal information -- my home address on 6/17/2014. It has been more than a month and have not received anything, which is upsetting because now BJ's has personal information of mine in which I trusted to disclose to them; which is my mistake because I wasn't aware of what they were going to do with that information (apparently not send me a courtesy card). So my advice is if BJ's asks for personal information don't, because it seems they have no process in place that ensures that they will deliver on what they promise (when it comes to customer feedback)  and it's unclear as to whether or not that information is secure or used for other purposes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=180,2.28,2.72,2.72,2.34,2.544

Because who doesn't like BJ's and Bloody Marys in the morning amiright? The breakfast food was really good. The service sucked. I had to go up to the bar twice and ask if we could get some waters.  When they first opened there was only like us and a couple of other people there to eat. Didn't really get busy until after we got our food. WHICH took about 40 mins. The staff there was looking for another waitress that apparently disappeared, and customers were coming in (sitting outside), was starting to get busy. The missing waitress I think her name was Maria? came back into the  restaurant and said she was looking for the fu*king managers card, or something to that effect. Flipping out in the bar area where MY family 7 and 8 year old were at eating their breakfast. Lots of F bombs going on. Took everything I had to not go punch her in the throat =)  WITH THAT SAID, I don't know who the Hostess was as far as her name goes, but she was great. She came and got our empty plates came and gave my family refills while our waitress was MIA. Super sweet girl. I ordered 2 bloody marys while I was there, because that is how I get my vegetable in take. They were WAY different. The first one was the bomb the second one tasted like a V8 with a bunch of olives in it. GROSS. I also asked for a Diet Coke for my daughter who has Type 1 diabetes and they gave her a Dr. pepper or Mr. pib. Thanks Assh0les, I specifically asked the waitress anything Diet please because my daughter has Type 1. It wasn't like we had a huge order of drinks to get mixed up and it wasn't even busy yet. The girl who was the awesome bartender came up to another employee and was telling her and showing her how a brand new bottle broke over the ice and had to melt the ice because of the glass that was broken into it. Yes thank you for announcing that as I am sitting here drinking my V8 Bloody mary. Best service ever! The last 2 BJ's that I have been to have been in the OC. NO THANK YOU.

After eating elsewhere on Main Street, my girlfriend and I decided to head to BJs for a pizookie. I went on my phone and ordered dine ahead hoping to make it a painless dessert. I reserved a time of 10pm and was told it would be 15 mins. We were sat at 10:30 and did not see our waitress for another 15 minutes. By then our pizookie had arrived and she stopped and apologized. We asked for our bill and that was promptly delivered. Although picking it up was another 10 minute wait. We got up and found our waitress to give her the bill.  The most disappointing part of last night was me accidentally leaving my phone on the table. It took but two block to realize I had forgotten it. We called back and were on hold for 10 mins before I decided to walk back and retrieve my phone. The hostess said they were getting a manager to unlock the office. After 10 mins he comes up empty handed and grabs my info seeming very insincere. I assured him I knew I had left it at the table and that I was going to locate my iPhone with my girlfriends phone. I asked what would happen when I found my iPhone located there. He said I would not find it because no one had it. I step outside and begin locating my phone and before I could even locate my phone I received a call from the waitress stating she had found my phone.  I walk right back into BJs and she has my phone I'm hand. I ask her where she found it as the manager walks up and she is stumbling over her words to give an answer or a name. I was livid. I then asked the manager what the policy was on lost items for the restaurant as I could only assume it would be to turn them in or place them in a certain location for patrons.  Having worked at restaurants, I know this type of thing happens a lot. I also know things like a phone just do not go ""missing"" one moment and there the next. Sad to know that there is such a lack of honesty and integrity at an establishment such as this one.

We were a party of 7 looking for a small meal before a big BBQ feast later at night so two of us shared the deep dish lasagna, I got a root beer for myself, and the rest of the table shared a medium deep dish pizza.  After we ordered, our server left all the menus at the table all cluttered until about 15 minutes later when I asked for a second or third refill on my root beer. For my root beer refills, server seemed a little annoyed (head down, didn't say a word when he took the mug to refill nor when he brought it back) which made me feel a little awkward thinking I had done something wrong for asking for refills.  Also, I am aware the deep dish lasagna and deep dish pizza both take longer to bake because of their...deepness, but the wait was ridiculous. It was at least 30 or 40 minutes later before we got our two food items. The restaurant wasn't crowded either. If it is supposed to take that long, a reminder from the server when we ordered these items would have been fine, but we didn't get one. No ""sorry for the wait"" afterwards either. Food finally came and I have always loved the deep dish lasagna at BJs so that came out perfect as always. Deep dish pizza also got good feedback and the group wished they had ordered a larger one. Deep dish at BJs isn't really deep dish though, probably half the height of a regular deep dish pizza with an overly large crust but our buddies didn't complain so oh well. The five who shared the deep dish pizza felt a little awkward at the end when they paid enough cash to cover the bill and a 20%+ tip, but weren't given the change back.   For the experience we got, we would definitely not have tipped that much.

98,Leland S.,"Irvine, CA",876,755,1008.0,4.0,2015-04-10,"I don't usually do corporate but when I do it's when I receive gift cards, free pizookie coupons, and happy hour. Here's how my experience went: Ambiance Parking | Plenty of parking whether it's street or garage. We came here on a Tuesday evening for Surf City nights at around 6pm. We didn't have any problems at the garage 2 streets over 2 dollars for 2 hours? I'm down with that. Seating | Plenty of seating outside and inside however it does get pretty packed. The tall seats are on a first come first serve basis though. Feels | In the heart of Huntington Beach Main Street. Coming here during Surf City nights is an additional plus. Feel free to watch a game or even people watch. It's a nice place for almost any type of night. Food: Spinach & Artichoke Dip (A-OK) * Borderline good and okay. Good because it was served fresh and has a nice kick to it. However I wished they balanced the ratio so there's enough dip for the chips. Great White Pizza (Recommend) * Deep dish and delicious, you can't go wrong with alfredo sauce! Ask for some tabasco too. Mediterranean Pizza (A-OK) * Though it is mediteraneany. I personal don't like the olives... =/ Avocado Egg Rolls (A-OK) * I used to enjoy these however I feel like it got more unhealthier. The crunch is there along with the rich avocado however ours was pretty oily and that just made us full before the pizzas came. Customer Service: They were pretty quick with or order nothing too special but good respectable service. Overall: 4 stars. I like the options on the happy hour menu. Price is about right, the wait was reasonable and the food was delicious. Not a bad way to enjoy Huntington Beach especially during happy hour. TL;DR Tips: *RSVP for nicer seats! *Happy Hour | M-F:3-7pm & S-Th:10-Close * Kitchen closes an hour before close",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40,3.68,3.04,3.04,2.8320000000000003,3.2960000000000007
252,Mk T.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,12,9.0,1.0,2015-04-11,"Giving one star is way too generous. I went to BJ's today with two other people and the service was SO BAD. We were treated as a joke just because we looked young. They probably thought we were going to dine and dash. Keep in mind we arrived at 5 pm. We ordered an appetizer, a pizza, and the trio pizookie. The appetizer took 20 minutes to come out. After we finished that, the pizza was still not out yet. We basically stared at each other across the table for 40 minutes. I caught myself asking ""where's the pizza?!"" at least 5 times. Our waitress passed our table so many times. Not once did she check up on us, yet she checked other tables to see how they were doing. We also asked for parmesan cheese but by the time our waitress brought it out, we finished the pizza. Last was the pizookie. We specifically ordered it after finishing the appetizer because we knew it would take awhile to make. We figured that if we ordered it early, then we would get it right after we finished the pizza. We thought wrong. It took an additional 20 minutes after constantly pestering three other waiters. The service was so bad that it left me at a loss for words. Other people who came after us left before we even got our dessert. We didn't even leave the restaurant until around 7:50. I have never felt so disrespected. This sort of treatment is unacceptable. NO ONE should ever be belittled just because of their age and I will NOT be coming back to this location. BTW, I'm not writing a review to try to get compensation. I'm writing one to let others know that it's NOT OKAY to look down on others and treat them unfairly. Not only did I leave in a bad mood, but I lost 2 hours and 50 minutes that I'll never get back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=240,3.56,3.01,3.01,2.436,3.23

When we came in to ask for a table, the hostess treated us with a manner that made us feel disrespected. We felt because we looked young, she treated us with a rude manner, like we were going to dine and dash or something. Personally, I felt extremely disrespected and I was disappointed. The wait time to get a table was pretty reasonable, but after we sat down, the wait time for our food was OUTRAGEOUSLY UNREASONABLE. We got our appetizer (Spinach and Artichoke Dip) 20 minutes after we sat down and it took another 40 minutes to get our entree (4 slices of BBQ Chicken Pizza). We decided to order 3 mini pizookies when we finished our appetizer, because we knew it would take awhile to make, but 30 minutes after we finished our pizza, we FINALLY received our dessert after asking a couple different waiters/waitresses. What's the point of telling your waitress ahead of time if it's going to take the same amount of time or even longer? Also, our waitress didn't even bother to check up on us, while she checked on others and I felt like we were treated unfairly.

They have many choices and it's a great way for multiple people to order and eat and bond. What separates BJs from somewhere like California Pizza Kitchen is that they have more options on other dishes to choose from. Kind of like a less variety version of Cheesecake Factory and with more pizza.  My favorite of their pizzas is barbecue chicken pizza! They don't overwhelming put BBQ sauce and they have tomatoes on top too. I also like their vegetarian one as well. You can choose to make pizzas without chicken or meat; they aren't sticklers about sticking to exactly the way the menu is written out.  For their other dishes, I've tried the Caesar salad. What I love about the Caesar salad here is that they actually give you a decent amount. You can also add protein on it, which I added salmon! The salmon was really, really well flavored and cooked! I would get this again if I wanted a lighter meal.  But if you're coming with a large group, it's best to go with pizzas and some appetizers!  And for dessert, always go with the 3 option pizookies!!!  You get to try more flavors and it allows you to share as well. One pizookie is too much for me, personally, because it can get really sweet with the ice cream and cookie itself.  Their service is pretty good. Their pricing is also reasonable as well.

I ordered a beer and when it arrived and I started to taste it I was greeted with a lovely grain taste in which that means that the lines need to be cleaned. Of course the bartenders tried stating to our server that nothing was wrong with the beer after they tested it. Second, when our food arrived I noticed immediately a lovely hair on the burger so when I presented it to the waitress I asked her what does this look like and she "" I don't know a string or hair"" I immediately said to her try a hair that was on my burger. She immediately took it back and now I got to watch my wife eat as I waited for a new burger. Now during this entire time, not once did the manager come over to apologize for the beer and definitely not even the food. Until the very last moment is when the manager came over to apologize and stated that my burger will be out in 30 seconds hmmm try another 5 minutes.

It was then another 15 minutes before she returned to take our food order. While everyone in my party (4 of us) were not happy with the service, we relaxed a little since our food order was put in. It ended up taking about 35 minutes for the food to come out. We were honestly just about to get up and leave but we saw a girl bringing the food. The food was pretty good. I personally ordered a burger, and must say it was definitely well prepared. While I wasn't happy waiting over a half hour for it, I am glad it still came out to my liking.

The chicken Alfredo actually had a decent portion of meat even though still around 35 to 65% meat to carb ratio, the pizza on the other hand was extremely unbalanced considering bj's famous thick dough pizzas, just eyeballing i would say something around 5 to 10% max both by volume and mass and even low on veggies and other ingredients, felt a bit like eating a giant piece of bread with a thin spread of everything else, but i guess the bogo coupon does make it an acceptable occasional option.

It was a quest dip and the top layer was cold so the cheese hardened. The chips were cold. So we sent it back. It came back 10 minutes later warm. Not hot  but somewhat warm. Pizza comes it's okay. But luckily I've been to the other locations so I know they actually have bomb food here. I think it's just this location and poor staffing. Waiter was not attentive at all either. Hopefully it gets better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=140,2.36,2.75,2.832,2.184,2.5940000000000003

I let that one go not that big of a deal. Ordered a side salad with dressing on side and salad came with dressing already coated on there. We ordered an appetizer,mozzarella sticks, and never received them. Next we split a deep dish pizza with half buffalo and half meat pizza. My boyfriend ordered with no tomatoes and behold there were tomatoes. Whenever they refilled they left the old glasses on table and didn't bother to pick up. Pizza was not great so I boxed it and gave it away to someone who needed it. Never coming here again. Bad service and food does not taste good.

Immediately after our orders were taken the server never came back once but preceded to walk past our table twice while my empty glass just sat there and never did he once ask if i wanted a refill. Our food was brought out by another server who I had to ask him for a refill which he said he would tell my waiter. I guess he decided he had no choice but to come back and give us our drinks, to which he proceeded to ask us how the food was. After then he went back to avoiding our table and helping all his other tables but ours. It's kinda of sad we actually had to ask the hostess for to go boxes and to put in our order for free pizooki day. To once again he wasn't the one who brought our dessert to the table. He happily came back with our checks 5 mins later to which he charged us for one of the pizookis when clearly we shouldn't of been charged for one. When my friend tried to explain it to him he simply said its one per table your server should of told you that. Funny thing he was our server and this problem could of been avoided if he actually did his job. He proceeded to talk to his manager and come back to us with an attitude saying the manager said they'll take it off but this is the last time. I like how all of sudden the problem clearly got turned around on us when he wasn't the one doing his job in the first place.

Walking in we would expect someone to be curious and ask for a name and for us to be seated or just possibly wait. Which I am totally fine with as its Downtown HB. But first of all the staff was ignorant and ignored myself and my girlfriend that was with me. This made us feel not valued at all as a customer even though It was around 2:45 and wasn't even that busy. But after this was said they put us in the back of the restaurant next to the smelly bathroom which both waiters and waitresses were walking in and out of without washing their hands! Uhhh disgusting... So I would think the experience wasn't too bad as I have been to other bjs restaurants and had amazing experiences. Nope we ordered a plate of buffalo wings which were not only freezing cold but old like they had been sitting there for a long period of time. I only confronted them after bout 20 minutes of waiting for them To finally stop Talking to each other and reach our table in the back to realize my waiter went on break and didn't tell us or let us know we didn't have another waiter. After this happened we waited another hour and was around 4:15-4:25 when we finally received replacement for wings we ordered. Which by the way they tried to charge us for when they Couldn't even do the first order right? Gimme a break. After an hour and half later around 4:35 the food finally arrived and you could tell was rushed and undercooked on the chicken which my Girlfriend got and the pizza I ordered was way chewy and almost fought in my mouth cause of the dough.

Parking can be a little crazy. You will be ticketed. $1.75 for 2 hours at the meters, not bad. Parking structure is cash only. The meters accept debit.  There is outside dining at the restaurant. One level. Nice bar area. The rest of the seating is limited.  We sat down ready to order. After the order was placed I was browsing through my BJ'S app and found a free appetizer or mini pizookie .  I should have known. I asked the server let's call him ""Austin."" About ordering a appetizer. His reply was he would have to check with the Mgr. about using the coupon, because we ordered a ""special of the day"" after 10 minutes he comes back to offer a refill on my water. I asked if I could order the appetizer. He was waiting for a Mgr. to get approval. 10 more minutes I grab him and he says good news  it was approved. I need to watch you redeem your coupon. What?!  Actually Yelp has the same coupon when you check in. I'm going to use that one. He said I had to use the one on the BJ's app. Finally after a few minutes of going back and forth, he said that's fine AND walked away! No order taken. So we continue to wait. No appetizer, no salad which was ordered 40 minutes earlier. No ""Austin"" . We left see him on the way out and he said our food is soon to be coming out.  We said thank you, but no thank you.

Our waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! There was only one other table she was taking care of so there is no excuse here. First she spilled some chips on me, and when I asked for extra napkins she never returned. I also wanted to let her know it was my bf's birthday when he went to the restroom so it would be a surprise, and she paid no attention to me! I looked to see if she was busy and she walked to the bar where a few coworkers were hanging out and just started talking socially. When I finally got her attention I was greeted with so much attitude I couldn't believe it. She slapped my menu closed in my face and walked away as if she were in a hurry while I was still talking to her in mid sentence!

We checked in our party of 11 at 9:00 pm on April 18, 2017 with an estimate wait time of 30-45 minutes. As 45 minutes creeps up our anxious group wanted to know why it was taking so long, so we decided to ask one of the host, how much longer will it take to get seated? She replies that they already have a spot reserved for us but that they're waiting for a party to leave to complete our seats. We understood and proceeded to wait. Another 30 minutes passes by and now we're getting more anxious because they still haven't called us after more than an hour of waiting. We were told by one of the waitresses that the party blocking us from getting our seats has already gotten their check. Another waitress told us she would talk to the party to see if they're ready to wrap it up, she walks towards them but never acknowledges them and proceeds to come back to us and lie in our face saying again ""they have their check."" I had politely walked up to this group of three asking if they were done since we've been waiting for so long, they had told me they're service is horrible and they even had to call another waiter to take their orders. Oh the the funny part is they didn't even have their check and were barely ordering dessert! That made me and the other members of our group outrages. The manager ""Michael Avila"" started sympathizing with us telling us he's ""trying to accomadate us"" when even he told us before that said party had their check.

Normally I eat here during the week and never come to Main St on the weekends (we live a few blocks away) but decided to give it a shot as a last minute Sunday dinner.  We got here and the wait wasn't bad just about 5min total. We were sat down and about 5-10min later we were greeted by our waitress. Since we have eaten here on numerous occasions we already knew what we wanted to order. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and dinners. Shortly after ordering we received our drinks. Then I recieved the soup that came with my dinner (Prime Rib). The only problem was that I asked for it to come after the appetizers. No big deal I will just put it to the side and eat it later. Then our appetizers come and we proceed to eat them. A little while after the appetizers I am am informed that my Prime Rib is not offered in Rare/Medium Rare at the moment and I can either have it Medium, Medium Well or Well Done. I decide to get it Medium only because I didn't want to wait for a different meal to be made. The meals come a few min later and my Prime Rib is more on the Well side than Medium. Whatever it's not the end of my life. The food is good and it's getting late, my kids need to get home and go to sleep since they have school in the morning.  We finish our food and I ask the waitress for a few to go boxes, our check, parking validated and the Pazooki that was included with my meal. She realizes that she put my order in wrong but said that she will have her manager fix it. She comes back with our boxes and check. She informs me that the Pazooki is being made as we speak. Our bill is $68 so I decide to leave her a $20 tip because I know that servers rely on tips to make any real money. We box up our food and wait for our Pazooki. And wait. And wait. And wait. After 30min of trying to get our servers attention I finally corner her at the front register and ask her about the Pazooki. She said that she will check on it. She comes back and says that her manage is putting a rush on the Pazooki upon which I tell her that it's already been over 30min since we ordered it. Nobody at our table has anything left to drink and we haven't gotten any water refills since starting dinner. I tell her to just cancel the desert. I decide to change her tip from $20 to $10 which is still probably more than most would tip under this situation. I am unsure if or when we will come back. If we did it will definitely never be on a weekend and even at that it's probably going to be a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40,3.4,2.9,2.864,2.568,3.1

88,Christina M.,"Barelas, Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,2.0,2017-06-14,"The staff at this location is.... weird. They seemed rude and disorganized. I understand they were busy when I went in but based on the size of their staff, you'd think they could manage it. I felt uncomfortable before I was even seated. I walked up to the hostess and a guy I believe was a busser. The interaction was just weird. These two particular staff members made sarcastic comments about something that the people I was with were wearing them they turned and laughed at each other. I'm pretty sure they were fucking with us.  The hostess led us to a dirty table, after she told us that someone had already gone to clean it. I understand things happen but it was just disorganized and the staff seemed to lack communication. At one point, someone at the table next to me spilled a drink on them and the bussers didn't seem to know what to do. The spill stayed on the floor for a while after that until what looked like a manager told a busser to clean it. The guy seemed really confused like he didn't know what he was doing for a moment then finally took care of it. When our food came out, the guy giving us our food made more weird sarcastic comments. I understand trying to make small talk but there are more things to talk about than something you observe about your guests. He even mocked my voice, which kind of high pitched. I guess he was trying to be funny or whatever but I was on edge because of the comments from the hostess earlier.  I observed the other staff members. I noticed that the servers around me at other tables were very nice, courteous and polite. Out waitress, Danielle R. was great. If not for her being just a normal waitress, I'd have thought that the staff's goal for the night was to see how many customers they could piss off. I guess it just seems that the bussers, hosts and runners are bored or something and trying to entertain themselves at the expense of their guests. It was just weird and uncomfortable. I think that staff really needs to consider how they look to their customers and how they treat them.  2.5 stars.

67,Samantha M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",262,3,,1.0,2017-06-18,"Came in on a Wednesday night... walked into the restaurant, no one was standing at the greet stand. We waited for about 5 minutes before someone finally walked up to greet us, I think it was someone who worked the to go area because the actual host came to take over eventually. We asked if we could have a table outside since we had noticed some were open but were waiting to be bussed. We were told that table would be offered to he next person on the waitlist. No big deal, could we be added the the waitlist? It was just a bizarre experience with the host because they weren't friendly at all and I felt like I was having to direct the flow of the experience. Normally wouldn't a host offer this to you? I felt like it was more of a ""what do you want"" situation? Anyways.. we were told we could have the next table that got up outside. So we waited outside, watched the table get up and leave and then stood there and watched nobody buss it for 10 minutes.. finally I went and found someone to buss it. They cleared as much as they could but it still needed another trip and a wipe.. and the host was no where to be found again.. finally I look at my husband and we are unsure about whether or not to just seat ourselves? Finally the host comes up to the table and leaves us the with menus. We know what we want and are hungry and ready to order. Our server greets us and was nice and prompt, but the food took soooo long. Our pizza arrives and is not hot but we are so hungry and don't want to wait for a new one. We know we want a pazookie so we put in the order for that which also took around 20 Minutes. No one cleared our dirty plates or silverware from dinner so we are eating our dessert around dirty dishes. We just want to pay and leave. Overall a dining experience that should have only taken an hour to an hour and a half tops took over 3 hours because the host and bussers were MIA and the food took a ridiculously long time.

I question Jared about the short change and he questioned if I was being honest. Then said he believed me and remembered putting only one $20 bill. He then awkwardly pulled out a wad of cash from his BACK POCKET and handed me the second $20.

89,John L.,"Emeryville, CA",74,227,10.0,2.0,2017-07-06,"Sometimes a busy night means long waits for tables.  I get that. But when a 20-25 minute wait turns into nearly an hour, and I have to bus my own table just so the nearly an hour wait doesn't turn into over an hour, I tend to get a little cross with the service.  Still, it's to be expected at a place like this.  However there's a line where expectations end and incompetence comes into play.  BJ's crosses it. Pros:  +convenient location to Huntington Beach pier. +Plenty of big screens inside to catch the game +Good portion size and price +Wide selection of entrees Cons -crowded -loud even for a bar/pub -slow, inconsistent service -parking can be difficult A party of six can be somewhat challenging but it felt like this location had maybe 4 tables that could  fit six, less if you don't want to be crammed into a corner. We ordered an appetizer (calamari) and it arrived with no plates to eat it on. I asked for plates for our party of six (the server never brought them out) and got four.  Our drink order was wrong, and when they did remember to bring the final plates, one of them had baked on cheese from an insufficient cleaning. Waiting for a drink refill was at least 10 minutes from the tune we had to flag our server down to ask for a refill.  For the duration of our meal, we saw our server at the following times: ordering drinks, ordering entrees, getting refills (the first time had to be solicited, and there was only one other time), and checking in on how we were doing.  Once.  And of course, checking if we were ready for the bill, completely forgetting to see if we wanted dessert, much less actually bringing the dessert that came with our meal. And throughout, not a single plate or glass was cleared off our table.  I'm not impressed.  They weren't rude and were apologetic, but in the end, intentions only cover so much and service as a whole drags them down.   The food is acceptable.  Flavors were solid and robust if a little salty, and the prices are typical, certainly not a tourist trap kind of pricing scheme.  There are a number of specials and while things are a little haphazard in terms of selection, everyone will be able to find something that hits the spot for them.  Everything entree wise was prepared correctly, but we're also talking about the bare minimum.   The only reason this review isn't a one star is that none of these errors were indicative of poor overall quality, just youth, inexperience and a busy night.   Service issues aside BJ's is a typical damily/bar restaurant with all the potential pitfalls being realized in a beach side chain restaurant.  As I've said before, when part of a franchise or chain, service is the main way to distinguish yourself, and this place fails that metric.  It's the nature of the beast, so take it into consideration when looking for a place to eat.  Especially when the beast is poorly trained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40,3.04,2.69,2.836,3.0800000000000005,2.83

As soon as we walked into the door we where greeted properly and asked where we would like to sit. We sat in a booth and settled in. Our sever Natasha came over immediately and asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for a couple waters and looked over the menu. My guest ordered a pizza and I the spaghetti and meatballs, with a side of asparagus. Well when the food came, it was acceptable and filling. Our server came and asked if everything was ok and refilled our water. After we finished we gave our server a thumbs up and both left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. I will definitely come back when I'm in town.  Two thumbs up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2,3.6,3.13,2.968,,3.318

We were sitting in what appeared to be the bar, to the left of a wall separating the bar area from the restaurant area.  Based on the fact that we thought we were in the bar, we ordered from the happy hour selections.  When the bill arrived, there were no happy hour prices.  I asked and learned the hard way that the tables in the bar area that are not high tops aren't considered the bar.

But as this one was closer to me I decided to give this location a try thinking it would be similar.  Honestly I was very disappointed with the service, our server took quite a long time while it was not particularly busy, and the food took a lot longer than normal. When the food did arrive it was put together very lazily (The Hickory Brisket Burger), and somehow had lost its flavor which I regularly crave.  Sorry but I will be going back to BJ's of Orange again and not returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=20,3.8,3.17,2.988,,3.422

8,Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69.0,4.0,2017-12-11,"Slow to start... but overall good experience. My wife and I arrived early for a group lunch. So, we went to sit in the bar. I grabbed a seat at a high top and she went to the restroom. My wife made it back to the bar, and I still hadn't been greeted by anyone yet. We waited a few more moments... still nothing. We decided to move to the bar top thinking that we can't possibly be ignored THERE because you're sitting directly in front of the bartender. Just our luck... as we sat at the bar... the bartender then proceeded right past us to head out to the high top tables and check on every single table.  I'd say we went a good 15 minutes without so much as a hello. We eventually got a drink order in, and everything seemed to normalize from there. Definitely a poor start though. Once we were sat, our group trickled in in bursts. So, I thank our server, Megan, for her patience. She was very helpful and attentive to our group.. even though we took a long time to get things going; much appreciated. She was also very gracious up front about splitting up checks accordingly. I don't believe there were any errors with orders, either. Great job. The kitchen did a great job of getting everyone's food out at one time. It's always a pain when you're in a large group, and yesterday's staff managed to make it happen.

12,Kristina R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-12-17,"So, first let me start by saying that I love going to BJ's and have never eaten anything bad. Tonight was my birthday, and my family and friends took me here to celebrate. We called ahead to make a reservation and dealt with a very rude, and immature girl on the phone who we had to repeat ourselves several times to. When we arrived, we spoke to the hostess who was obviously the same girl who we spoke with previously. She started by acting extremely rude, like we were majorly inconveniencing her simply checking in. She told us that since it was a busy night, our wait would be at least 20/30 min. We asked if we could sit in the bar, and she said fine so proceeded there to find a large enough table for our party. We sat down and let her know she could take our names off her list because we found a table. She again sighed, and gave us a major attitude saying 'thanks'. She then proceeded to come to our table, and very rudely asked us if we checked in?? We looked at each other kind of dumb founded since we literally just checked in with her two minutes prior. She then started knocking stuff over on our table (and not making any effort to pick them up) and threw menus down, sighed and walked away. At this point we were ready to leave, but I asked for a manager instead and explained the situation. He was very kind, and apologetic. Then, as we were sitting there, the hostess who is standing no more than five feet away starts staring me down- literally staring at me with a smirk on her face. She did this repeatedly for a good five to ten minutes before I asked her if she had a problem. She then said 'nope, enjoy' and proceeded to again stare at me in an angry manner. I asked her what her problem was and that I'd like to speak to the manager again and she laughed and said very condescendingly that she couldn't hear me. I asked our waiter for the manager again, which he again apologized for her actions. We didn't see her for most of the rest of our visit Which was pleasant. When our desert arrived, she was back again and stood only a few feet away talking and laughing to another employee VERY loudly about how there were very awful customers who decided to complain about how rude she was, and how she had an attitude problem. She laughed and again continued to point and stare in our direction. I have NEVER experienced a more rude, or inconsiderate 'hostess' in my life! We live less than 5 minutes away, and I will go out of my way to never go back to this location again! I have no idea how someone of this magnitude would even get a job here!

I had to ask them to clean it up but i just felt they should've checked the tables before seating people. There was orange juice spilled all over the floor in the table next to us. The spoon that they gave me for my soup was filthy with food from the previous customers. I asked for the a new one and the new one they gave me was just as bad. The food was just okay .

I'll support the local pizzerias in HB instead of going here from now on. UPDATE: The General Manager Michele sent a quick response apologizing and offering to make it up to me with a phone number to call. She said she wanted to talk to me personally and I should call at my earliest convenience. I tried calling and quickly found out it was the restaurant number instead of her direct line. Had to listen to an automated system for five minutes and press zero to talk to a real person. Somebody at the restaurant finally answered and said she wasn't working today. What a waste of my time. I tried to give them a chance to make it up to me and they just proved my point. I stand by my 1 star review. I'd give them zero if I could. TERRIBLE customer service.
