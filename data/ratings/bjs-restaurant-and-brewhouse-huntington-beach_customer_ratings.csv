I really enjoy the small bites that they have added to their menu. There is a ton of mozzarella in the tomato and mozzarella salad and it is a really great price! I am a big football fan and I really like that they have booths in the bar and a ton of flat screen TVs for watching the game. The late night happy hour is also great because I don't get off work during the week until around 8pm so I always miss regular happy hours but the late night one starts at a perfect time for me. My biggest complaint is that sometimes the bar is completely full during happy hour, while I appreciate that this is a sign of good food and prices, I wish the bar were a little bigger so that I didn't have to go somewhere else. I am vegetarian and they have a pretty good selection of items for me but I also like the Mediterranean pizza without the chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=860,3.8,3.6,3.6,3.056,3.68

Came here once with a lot of people celebrating a graduation.  Our server Linda...the asian one (not sure if there's another Linda, but anyways) came by our table and said it was last call.  A couple mins after she left I ran after her and asked if I can order one more drink and she was snappy and said, ""sorry, I just last called your table"" and walked away. Seriously? You just came to the table a couple mins ago.  Anyways I then asked her if she can split the checks and was pretty attitude-y about it.

610,Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,29,4.0,3.0,2012-02-06,"This review is for the late night happy hour only! Tip: sit at the bar! The bartenders are great talkers, know a helluva lot about beer, and will remember your favorite drinks when you come in often. I usually hit up BJ's after I work at my serving job. The beer is cold, the drinks, are stiff, and the company is a perfect compliment.  Late night happy hour eats are what they are: skimpy portions for a cheap price, but what else do you expect for everything 5 dollars and under?. I usually get the tomato, basil, and mozzarella salad. It's delicious and they will add some romaine in there if you ask nicely to bulk it up a bit.  My friend usually orders the ahi poke which is sashimi grade tuna diced up with avocado and served with fried wonton chips. I've also tried the spinach artichoke dip, salsa, potato wedges, and chicken tenders. All solid, bar food options.  During happy hour it can get a bit busy, so keep that in mind.

Like someone else said below . . . your service depends on the server you get and not the consistency of Bj's. I've had great servers and some who are definitely not so great : /  Also, my fiance and I made reservations here for my birthday once and they forgot/didn't write down our reservation. We ended up waiting a long time and it was a downer on the birthday fun. I tried making another reservation for my fiance's birthay and they gave me a hard time about making a reservation for 10 people because they had another reservation for 100 people. The food is good but not as good as TGI Fridays in my personal opinion and the service always varries but if you want to go to a place with a fun atmosphere that's in a good location, then this is the place.

They have a good selection of beers and cocktails and definitely have great pizza.  I've been to this location so many times and every time I always end up waiting a really long time for service but every dish I've had was really good. It seems like they have a lot of servers but mine seems to disappear all the time and if I ask another server, they just say they'll get mine... My favorites would have to be any kind of pizza, chardonnay shrimp pasta, and the Parmesan crusted chicken and sweet onion strings with ranch as a side dish.

However, at the end of the meal, I was shocked to see that I was still actually charged for the drink.  Most restaurants would instantaneously take the drink off as an apology but not this one.  I don't mind paying for a drink but to receive two unsatisfactory drinks in a row warrants a bad review in my book.  Get your stuff together BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=400,3.44,3.53,3.53,2.5640000000000005,3.494

I went to two locations and had issues but I will only put my issue with this location here..seeing as it was the worse. I brought a group of 9 women here last Friday night. We ordered drinks, entrees and a large pizookie. We were there almost 2 hours. A manager came over and asked us if we knew we had been there for almost 2 hours. We were a little dumbfounded by the question and not sure why he was telling us that.  He repeated himself a few times and the girl he was telling this to told him we were waiting for the bill. He then nodded to some guys who started rearranging all of the tables around us and scooting us out. I have never had this happen. We never once had a lull in our ordering. We were constantly getting drinks, food, and dessert and then promptly paid for our tab. It was very rude and this happened to be a bachelorette party.

I used to avoid Bj's because they always had a huge wait and I totally think the extra seating is helping. Overall the only thing you still can't get my kids to eat are the Happy Face fries... The rest of the food was really tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880,3.24,3.49,3.49,2.768,3.39
532,Joanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,760,930.0,3.0,2012-07-15,"So instead of running 9 miles to burn 1000+ calories this evening, I went to dinner with my sister, her husband and babies and her in-laws to consume 1000+ calories....hehe So I have never been to a BJ restaurant and this is my first time here..for a party of 5 and 2 babies the wait was over 20 minutes apparently because a waitress came out and handed out small piece of pizza to us....this is apparently what they do when you have waited over 20 minutes...nice gesture. We finally got a table after another 10 minutes and even though I looked at the menu while waiting I almost couldn't make a decision because their gluten free thin crust pizza sounded safe...but they also had lighter options that I should eat but didn't sound as appealing to me.....therefore yes you guess it I ordered the Gluten-Free Thin Crust pizza with sausages, mushrooms, olives and roasted garlic accompanied by a sparkling raspberry lemonade. The food took about another 15 minutes to come out which felt pretty long because by this time I was pretty hungry. When my pizza came out I gobbled down the first slice pretty darn quickly...however the crust is super thin but not super crispy - it was still pretty good though. I ate about 3 slices and that's bout 126 calories per slice so it's not too damaging. However I did spot a Gluten-Free Pizookie and I heard that they are super good and BJ is known for it so I had to try it....my sister ordered this other baked dessert called the Baked Beignet and told me it's really good too.  So apparently they overbaked and burnt my pizookie which was a disappointed because it was really chewy and hard to scrape off the dish....it wasn't as good and it's not because it's gluten free because I have had gluten free cookies before and it wasn't this chewy and sticky. The baked beignet was okay - it's like a crepe - but this was baked and topped with strawberry sauce, strawberries and ice cream..it's actually quite sweet. not my typical choice for dessert...even the pizookie was just a little over the edge for sweetness for me but hey if you have a super sweet tooth then it's a perfect dessert.  Our waitress was pretty nice and overall it's okay....however I must say this must be a good place to go drinking or drink because the first few pages of their menu are all wines, beers and alcoholic drinks. not cheap ... maybe during happy hour?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=520,3.24,3.48,3.48,2.7,3.384000000000001

The wedge salad is very delicious and the dressing is a great mix of zap and blue cheese.  Love the pizza, very different approach with the very fluffy dough and tomato chunks.   What ruins the food experience is the service.  I've tried this place a few times and out of 5 visits only 1 had an attentive server (it was her first day).  I did take out once to avoid the lower than average service and they put me on hold for over 5 minutes for curb side.  I hung up and walked in... only to be completely ignored and smiled at by the manager (young manager) and she happiely talked to all her servers coming and going around me.  It took another 5 minutes just to get someone to take my money and to get my to go order...

860,Don H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",136,133,54.0,1.0,2012-07-30,"I was contacted by an area manager after my first trip here and after some mishaps in the communication I was sent an apology letter and a ""courtesy card"". I am a very reasonable man and understand everyone has off days and I am more than willing to give a second chance. However the second chance was almost worse than the original. Our waiter apparently forgot about us at one point because we didn't see him for about a half an hour. When he saw us and was startled back into to remembering he was in charge of us, he stuttered out asking why we hadn't got our dessert yet. We had in fact finished our dessert a good 20 minutes earlier. For god knows what reason we went again, mostly because we still had credit there. We didn't expect much, and thats about what we got. Asked for 2 glasses of water, didn't get it, constantly waited for refills, asked about the spice of the hot wings was told the  regular buffalo was spicy and the other spicy ones were unbearable. Regular were not spicy at all and when I asked for the hotter sauce, I got a cold side of sauce which was fitting since my wings had gone cold waiting for him to come back, our pizookie which had been the saving grace came out with the ice cream mostly melted. This place is always busy and I can't figure out. We are 0 for 3 and have had such terrible experiences it blows my mind.

435,David C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",114,89,56.0,2.0,2012-08-05,"The food I recommend: Ribs! Get the full rack because it's only a slight increase in the price in comparison to the half rack of ribs. You also get a starter choice of clam chowder or any soup they have that day. Don't forget to ask for their clam chowder crackers also. They usually don't bring it out unless you ask for it.   Hint: Instead of getting mash potatoes or baked potatoes as a side with your entree of ribs, you may choose to get the side as another clam chowder, that way you'll have 2 clam chowders to share with your significant other! Drinks: Beer-wise. I'd recommend getting the Sampler. You get 8 different beers for about $12. Not only do you get a variety, but it's also fun with a group of friends! You don't get too full over it.  I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because of my last experience. ""I've experienced better basically."" I had dinner there last night with my girlfriend. While we were waiting for friends to arrive the server came out with the water. As he placed each one down the very last one fell towards me and onto the floor. The glass of water broke into pieces and I could feel the water soaking up my left leg of my jean. My girlfriend, who had heels and a skirt, was in danger of being cut from the broken glass. We checked to see if any shards pierced her. Now the table was also wet along with the surrounding area of our table. The server left u there to go get a broom. While our server was gone the nearby table was talking to each other about possibly suing BJ's if that were to happen to them. On the other hand, we seemed to be OK and felt like it wasn't necessary. Well, the server came back and scooped up the glass. However, he just came back with the broom and the scooper. How was he to know where all the pieces were though? BJ's lighting is quite dim so he was merely assuming he was finding all the glass. Luckily for him I took out my cell phone and used my flashlight ap to assist him. He didn't even say, ""Thank you."" It was more like I was the worker helping another fellow employee. Unbelievable. Now the problem actually continues with the following: Our table was still wet and had ice cubes. The floor was extremely slippery and risked us from falling or any other patron for that matter. We continued to wait for our replacement water. Finally, it was brought to us. However, what happened to our utensils? Where were our napkins or towel cloth? It was never given to us and he expected us to sit there with our table all glossy--serving as a reminder, ""Oh. It's not over yet! Stay tuned for more!"" When our friends arrived we told them about what had happened. We then ordered our food and waited 40 minutes until our clam chowder arrived. Usually we'd receive it less than 10 minutes with our crackers. Well, that wasn't the case. Instead, we waited 40 minutes and only got our clam chowder while our friends looked at us eat. My girlfriend even stopped our server to ask, ""May I have crackers for my clam chowder please?"" Guess what? The crackers never came. It completely slipped the server's mind! After finishing our clam chowder our empty bowl just sat there until the very end of our dinner. Thank you very much for reducing my eating space!  Furthermore, all of our entrees finally arrived. Ah Yes. The moment of truth. Once again, my girlfriend had to remind the server, ""Can we have some towels and utensils please?"" I mean, I don't carry an extra pair of forks, knives and spoons with me. So please give us some utensils to eat. Don't tease us with our food sitting right in front with us!  Fast-forwarding to the end. We signed up for BJ's rewards program and were told by our server that tonight's dinner will be properly added to our rewards account. However, I found out this morning from checking online that the server had lied about it and only processed 1 of the orders. Thanks a lot for confirming your lie multiple times! I don't know if the guy was just being lazy our perhaps he was just downright incapable of addressing his patrons, but I'm very disappointed that not once did he offer to give us any freebie. Not once did any other worker or manager come out to address the broken glass and water all over our table and floor. Not once did the server sincerely say, ""Sorry."" Instead, it just felt like he was rushing to hide the issue before he got in trouble.  In conclusion, we did leave him a fair tip even with the horrible experience he has given the 5 of us there. My past experiences at BJ's were wonderful, but this server managed to screw up everything. I'm assuming the manager was never notified at all about what occurred. Therefore, our server probably just went to the backroom and got a broom to clean it up before anyone found out. How it should have been handled was that he should have notified his manager and requested to give us a free SOMETHING or for the manager to come out to say SORRY for the rather scary incident. But No. That didn't happen. Case closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=420,3.12,3.44,3.44,2.7920000000000007,3.3120000000000007

I usually call in right before i get ready to drive, so that gives me like 20 mins of driving time. The management team here do what they can to please large parties. So feel free to speak to them if anything ever is needed or misunderstood. Here's a tip. Call in and put your group of 9 on the list, and then once you get there you can easily add 1-3 more people based on the section they put you in. It just depends on availability. Request the long tabled narrow section that has 2 designated tvs, (behind the hostess desk in the corner). Remember they will not usually allow you to call in a party of more than 9. So keep that magic number in mind. If you are waiting, remember the BAR is open seating and you can easily grab an open chair and drink a few beers while you wait. One last tip.

847,Karen C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,10,,2.0,2012-09-30,"Two disasters in a row at BJ's on Beach Blvd.  I think the reason so many of us do not have a good dining experience is the (inefficient and impersonal) SYSTEM  they have going.  When the server puts a drinks order (into a computer) you then have to wait about 15-20 minutes or longer.  Last week our server never got around to putting our order in, which we found out a half hour later from a different server.  It is a huge restaurant and we see servers RUNNING to keep up, and they sometimes  can't.  Last night our server would not even TAKE an order for a second beer until the glass was empty(!).  That meant (on the two occasions) we were not refreshed with a second drink until we'd been long out of what we had and the meal was essentially finished.  Apparently this is a hard and fast rule that allows no room for discretion on the part of the server.  We are in our early 70s and had not been to BJ's in about a year.  In the meantime we've been spoiled by other restaurants that demonstrate they are happy to have our business by providing good food and attentive, prompt, and friendly service.  We won't go back because it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Too bad because we like many items on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=640,2.72,3.34,3.476,3.208,3.0920000000000005

So sadly enough it was our family's first time ever trying BJ's, my dad wanted to go 'cause of the free Father's day pint glass & I guess there was a dish he liked in the mail-home flyer ad they sent. Our waiter seemed frustrated the whole night by giving us service w/ an attitude, that was a no-no for me especially on father's day. However, I give him props for getting all the modifications correct for our food. Started off w/ the thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer. HIGHLY recommend you start w/ this to open your stomach. It's very light and refreshing, the shrimp was not overcooked which is a plus. The sauce complemented well w/ the mango salsa in the lettuce cups. There were plenty of shrimp pieces as well (I think about 3 per lettuce cup)  Maui Glazed Porkchop - I've been on a pork chop crave and so I decided to get this. I should have figured that since it was on the under 575 cal menu it would be a small portion -__- It was ONE pork chop, instead of potatoes I subbed for steamed veggies. The veggies were perfectly steamed not too mushy and not salty. The pork chop could have used some work. Didn't really get much flavor from it and it was really small. I should have just ordered the regular 2 pork chops one BBQ Chicken Pizza - Mom ordered this dish since I told her per reviews the pizzas are bomb. However, mom was highly disappointed. There were a good amount of chicken chunks on the pizza which I liked 'cause I hate skimpy toppings, but according to my mom she liked Papa John's better =\ The pizza was also cold when it arrived Salmon Terriyaki - my sis ordered this dish, I have to say this was probably the best dish out of everything we ordered (wait nvm the shrimp lettuce wrap was). It was actually pretty expensive for this dish (about 17$) but I think the only reason it tasted good was cause it was drenched in terriyaki sauce. It was definitely a big portion, but most of it was rice... Chicken fettucini Alfredo - My baby sis ordered this and well she has the taste bud of a 13 year old so she said it was good, but the dish looked bland compared to Cheesecake Factory. The chicken breast was so small...HOWEVER the garlic butter bred that came w/ the dish was AMAZING! Everyone devoured the bread. It was really soft and warm Mahi Mahi w/ Scallops - Alright Star of the show, DAD ordered this dish. I think it's a great combo deal (bout $16), and on the ad it looked really good BUT when the dish arrived it looked nothing like the ad (go figure). The mahi was so small like literally my fist size and so were the scallops. The mahi was definitely over cooked, but the scallops were good. My poor dad was disappointed in his dish and just picked off the Salmon Terriyaki plate instead. CHOC CHIP PIZOOKIE - Ok we HAD to get this dish. It's amazing it took this long before I tried the pizookie since my friends always rave about it. It was SOOOOOOO good. Warm ooey gooey choc chip baked w/ scoops of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved this dessert. I shoulda got the trio to sample the other flavors. So to summarize it up, I probably would only go here for the pizookie or if I'm seriously watching my portion control on food.

721,James D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,25,5.0,2.0,2013-07-05,"I don't set the bar high when I go to BJ's but tonight was ridiculous. It started by being told the wait would be 25 minutes. Ok. It's Friday night. 45 minutes later (and after before being told that we were next and seeing three parties seated) we finally got a table. My daughter and I split a calamari appetizer and I wonder if half of it was fully cooked. The batter on several pieces was still doughy.  While we ate our calamari, my wife's garden salad came out, with balsamic dressing.  She ordered balsamic vinegar and oil.  After getting over the fact that a garden salad at BJ's is iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato, shredded carrots, and croutons, my wife asked for the balsamic vinegar and oil she had originally ordered.  What came from the kitchen? Balsamic vinegar and rice vinegar.  What cook can't tell vinegar from oil?  After waiting several more minutes for a check in from the waitress, my wife asks for olive oil and gets it a few minutes later with the comment from the waitress, ""it sure is hard to find olive oil in the place."" The oil tasted like it had been sitting out for a week or so. My bison burger came out (inconsistently cooked from well to medium from one side to the other) and cole slaw (think shredded cabbage with a dollop of ""dressing"").  Good thing we had the rice vinegar; I added it to my shredded cabbage to make slaw.  The delivery guy (not our waiter) also brought out some pasta dish, ""Tuscan Chicken Limon"", but my daughter had ordered ""Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak.""  Yeah, they sound the same.  Ten more minutes for her dish to be delivered.  We got a line from the waitress that she put in Chicken Fried Steak and she didn't know what was going on in the kitchen but our check reflected the ""Tuscan Chicken Limone.""   My wife ordered ""Maui Glazed Pork Chop"" with red potatoes that needed to be re-hydrated.  Warning, the glaze is spicy! At least we got a free pizookie out the deal but there was no apologetic attitude associated with the offer.  I guess mediocrity is par for the course at BJ's.   While we ate, a man and woman with their child in a stroller paid and left.  Immediately, two young, attractive, scantily clad girls sat down at the table before it had even been bussed. One got up to get menus from the front desk while a busboy ran over to bus the table. Almost immediately thereafter, the (apparent) manager was squatting in front of the table smiling, chit chatting with the girls.  I expected the waitress to blow them off, but no, she too had a conversation with them. I guess they worked there.  I was shocked that an establishment would let this sort of behavior stand when customers were patiently waiting for a table.  In the time it took us to get our check and pay, the girls had no less than 2 busboys, one waitress, the (apparent) manager and (apparent) assistant manager at their table, appetizer, drinks, and entrees delivered.  If BJ's doesn't think customers notice this sort of behavior, they're wrong. As we left, I counted three parties of 2 and one party of 6 waiting by the door. The night ended as we left the parking lot and had to dodge a BJ's employee running out the door in uniform, lighting up a cigarette, through a group of customers with children, into the parking lot. Did I mention the waitress and busboy wandering the floor texting? I don't think we'll return to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=620,3.08,3.31,3.44,2.6960000000000006,3.218
307,Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",255,367,514.0,4.0,2013-07-05,"My boyfriend took me here for lunch to celebrate our 5-month anniversary. Plus, he obtained an offer on Facebook that was a BOGO Free for any entree. In addition, my review may be a little biased considering the fact that this place has sentimental value for the both of us.  We waited around 15 minutes for a table (they offer pagers for you that doesn't work beyond the BJs facility, so be sure to stay nearby). I ended up ordering a PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ CRISP STRING FRIES (lunch menu) and my boyfriend ordered a LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF (sauteed with white onions, red bell peppers, napa cabbage, green onions and sweet baby carrots, tossed with teriyaki sauce. served over white rice and topped with sesame seeds). The PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH was cut in half by default (which I always love), and stayed crispy throughout all my bites. I was able to finish one half and my boyfriend was able to finish the other half. The amount of parmesan was perfect considering that I'm not a fond fan of overwhelming cheese flavors. The sandwich also came with what seemed like an acidic coleslaw immersed within the sandwich. As for the CRISPY STRING FRIES, they were a little bit of a disappointment. I assumed they were going to be crispy and straight considering that they had less surface area and width to be fried though, but there were a lot of fries that were limp and could have been even crispier.  As for the boyfriend's LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF, it was a perfect amount for lunch (unless you are super starving). The only thing we both had to complain about the entree was how the rice pilaf and the salmon bits were drenched in too much teriyaki sauce. Although the salmon was cooked perfectly, all we were able to taste was the teriyaki sauce. As a result, it made the dish too salty and our mouths too thirsty. I recommend having the sauce on the side so you can pour your perfect amount of teriyaki sauce.  Other than that, we are sure to come back here because of the great beer, happy hour, and it's sentimental value to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=320,3.16,3.32,3.436,2.9920000000000004,3.2560000000000007

Calamari: calamari itself is rather flavorless and not as crispy as I want it.  4. Pizza: I really don't like the pizza here. It's rather dry and there isn't enough sauce to tie the ingredients together. Toppings are also sparse and flavorless. Made the mistake of ordering two pizzas. 5.

I think a party after us got seated first (I could be wrong, so don't quote me on that). But it's fine, we still got seated pretty promptly. It took forever for the waiter to take our order though. I swear we were sitting there for almost half an hour when he finally came... it was NOT busy, mind you. The server looked a bit melancholic so maybe he was having a bad day. Who knows. In any case after we finally ordered, I noticed my plate had some food on it, so I was wiping it (as I do at Asian restaurants haha never an American restaurant like BJs). Our melancholic server asked if I would like a new plate and so I said yes and he took the dirty plate... and then he never came back with a new one! I had to wait until the pizza came (the person who brought the pizza out noticed I was missing a plate so he brought one). Ughhh, delaying my food experience. Not cooooool.

I hadn't gone in months and so when the Fam wanted to go out for dinner I naturally suggested Bj's.  They hesitatingly made a reservation for my party of 8 (had to involve the manager) despite their automated system saying reservations were taken for parties of 7 or more.... If your system says 7 or more you need to accept 7 or more and not give me crap for it. Upon arrival ten minutes before our reservation time at 7pm we check in and got our buzzer. At 7:45 we were still waiting to be seated!!! what is the point of making a reservation if you make us wait over 45 minutes!! Terrible. The wait should be 15 minutes max. It took TWO complaints and a Manager to get our party seated. Once seated our sweet server took care of us. Unfortunately the food runners messed up the rest of the evening. They kept bringing out the wrong food (2X) and ended up taking my Mothers order to another table. The manager had to come over and apologize offered her a free soup or salad while the kitchen remade her food. The entire table had their dishes except her..... one thing after another man... I will say this the manager was quite amazing in fixing her staffs mistakes. She seemed genuine in her concern and fixed each issue as promptly as possible.

When the crust is a thick deep dish it should be going and covered with topping, this was not. Service was nothing to write home about either. After trying for 10 minutes to get my servers attention, she was leaning against the wall by the bar avoiding eye contact, she finally came over. I told her the pizza was really dry and asked her for more sauce. About 15 minutes later a different server brought it out. The only reason I have this place ANY stars was the pizookie which was as delish as ever. No wonder it isn't called BJs Pizzaria any longer as their pizza is painfully subpar.

She went back to the back and came out 5 mins later saying ""This is the only bread we have, we don't carry any other kind"".

Parking: A few open parking spots despite football playoffs starting in a few minutes.  Seating:  There was a ton of open booth seating in the main dining area but she wanted to seat us in the small drab room at the back of the hostess stand. I don't think so!  I think that's where they hide people who don't look beachy enuf.  I asked her for a booth so she redirected us to the main dining area close to a TV.   Food: The tortilla soup was more like a thick stew. I was disappointed that it wasn't more watery - is that strange?  I also ordered the bruschetta appetizer but it came after I was done with my main course.  The hubby's Cajun chicken pasta was a bit starchy/pasty with a strange taste. Me thinks they threw some cayenne pepper in the pot and labeled it ""Cajun"".  No complaints on the Caesar salad the hubs ate although it appeared to be swimming in dressing.  Service: It started out good enough but soon after we ordered, our waiter was switched out.  The replacement completely forgot about our existence.  My iced tea was never refilled so I started drinking my husband's Pepsi. We had to flag him down for our bill after waiting for quite a bit of time after we finished.  Service was really pretty crappy.  After many dining and happy hour experiences here, I'd say you'd have to belly up to the bar for the best service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=180,2.96,3.12,3.308,2.536,3.0560000000000005

The fourth order, a sandwich, was room temperature.  We had to flag down our waitress to send our food back. SECOND TIME AROUND:  We waited and when two of he plates were delivered, they were lukewarm, again!  One of the burger plates came out and was ice cold and was immediately sent back.  One of the managers came over to apologize and give us the explanation that the burger was cold because the lettuce and tomato were ice cold, so that somehow prevented the patty from being hot....unbelievable!!  The food was still not hot, but we gave up, as we were not willing to wait any longer to eat.

Couldn't get a babysitter, so my wife and I decided to cheat on our diets and get some to go food. Settled on BJ's - an old standby chain we've been eating at for 15 years. 6:30 - My wife calls and orders 1 pizza, 1 brochette, 2 root beers. Should be done in 20 minutes. 6:55 - I admittedly lagged a little and found that the place was so slammed for Valentine's Day, I couldn't find an open spot on their curbside service. Circled the parking lot for a while until one opened up. 7:10 - Found a spot! Called the number. Server came out, took my card, swiped it.  7:12 - Signed my copy. Tipped server $3.00. He said my food would be right out. 7:15 - Started to wait. Got on my phone and caught myself up on Pinterest (don't judge!).  7:30 - Notice that I'm watching people come and go. This isn't right. My phone started to die, so I called to check on my food order. The girl said ""Let me go check in the kitchen. I don't see it out here."" 7:32 - Phone dies. Getting angry. I couldn't leave since I already paid. Regretted leaving a tip. 7:35 - Manager comes out hands me a gift card with an unspecified amount on it. Apologizes for making me wait. Said they're putting a new pizza in for me because the first one was cold and gross. ""It should only take 5 minutes"". Mentions he'll get my Root Beers too. 7:50 - Server finally comes out with a bag of food. Half-hearted ""sorry to make you wait"" with no explanation. Mentioned he put in some cards for free Piezookies in there. (Great. I guess I'll save it for next time I decided to eat crappy...?) I was so over it by this point, I just wanted to get out of there and get home. 7:55 - I scream profanities in my car. I get on Edinger to take the freeway home. Realize they forgot my drinks!! Drive around the block to get back BJ's. 8:00 - Have to go in (Phone was dead). Tell the to-go girl that I was the guy they made wait 45 minutes outside and that they forgot my drinks. She looks startled and we both see my drinks sitting on the counter behind her. She apologizes puts them in a carrier for me, and I leave. 8:15 - I get home. My wife was starting to get really worried for me. I explain the situation to her. We roll our eyes at the gift cards. They can give us free food, but they can't give us back our evening which they nearly ruined. 8:20 - I bite into my pizza. It was totally undercooked. Soggy, doughy crust and the cheese wasn't even fully melted. I had to throw it into my oven to make it decent. All in all, an incredibly frustrating evening. I get that it was a holiday and a Friday and they were slammed, but that's still no excuse for completely forgetting about my order and then just saying ""sorry"" with no explanation.

587,Katie A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",39,4,,5.0,2014-03-13,"Okay, so I'm just going to flat out say that this BJ's is by far, THE BEST. I coach water polo at one of the local high schools and I needed a place to throw our end of the season banquet. I thought of Bj's immediately but had never done a restaurant before so I didn't know what I was getting into. I literally started out with a head count of 47 guests, which ended up to be about 67 people. I called their manager Tim C. probably a million times over the course of four weeks prior to the banquet. Our banquet was originally going to take place on the patio and then the head count was too many and I literally almost had a heart attack. I called Tim and he was able to move us to their bigger room and switch the smaller party that was booked in it to the patio. He was more than happy to email me the menu and the total price, plus the contract. Tim wasn't there during the night of the banquet but his other manager Dawn was there and she was fabulous. We ended up needing more seating and she immediately set up three extra tables and got our guests taken care of. She was there during set up, during the initial first two rounds of food going out, during the middle of the night she checked back again briefly, and then at the end she came by to make sure everything had went well. She made her presence known and it was comforting to know a manger was focusing so much on our party and its success. Kudos to management! We were able to order 4 deep dish pizzas, one pasta, and have a Cesar's salad. All the food was unlimited, as well as drinks. Cost $14.75 a person for the buffet menu and it cost a little extra for pasta but TOTALLY WORTH IT. The food was to die for!! I don't even know how many pizzas we went through or how many pounds of pasta, but my parents and kids were full.  I think the reason this night but I mean.... let's not forget about our service! I had three servers, one of them was Jamie and the other I believe was Trent. I feel so bad that I don't remember the last two names completely 100% but they were still amazing. They were funny and carefree. When I felt like I was going to have a meltdown from stress they were there to help out and were always checking on me and my guests. Jamie even cut the custom cake I brought in. I didn't even know they could do that! I was freaking out because I wasn't sure how to cut a cake and here comes Jamie like, ""Would you like me to cut your cake for you?"", is that even a question Jamie!? LOVED THE SERVICE. Trent was funny and joked around with the girls. His personality totally showed and he was very quick with drink orders and cleanup. At the end of the night, I know how hard those servers worked and I felt they deserved nothing less than 20% tip.  I was embarrassed that one of my parents was rude towards Jamie and I apologize profusely again. I appreciate the servers and all their hard work. This banquet would not have been a success if it had not have been for those servers. They busted there butts and they did it with smiles on their faces. I would not hesitate to bring my business there again. I STRONGLY encourage anyone looking for a banquet or large party venue to choose BJ's of Huntington Beach.

The last time we went (this past Sunday) we got our food and no utensils, napkins, sauces, and our waitress disappeared for 20 mins. We flagged down another waitress who gave us attitude for asking for stuff from her and said ""yeah. hold on."" and walked away. We waited 5 more minutes and just decided to take the sauces from another empty table and told the waitress when she finally came back.  At the end of the night, we paid $40 for a small deep dish pizza and the jalapeno burger including tip. Definitely not worth the price. You're paying for the ambiance, and frankly, there was none that night. We only saw our waitress 3 times that night.

So after several minutes we were finally able to flag down a bus boy to get us some forks to eat with. Shortly after we started eating we noticed that my wife didn't get any garlic bread with her pasta, so we asked the server and she said it didn't come with any even though it was in the picture on the menu. Also when you look up the menu online, it clearly states that all pasta comes with garlic bread. After eating 1/3 of the meal, I then find a hair in my chicken and had to get a replacement meal to go since we had been there so long my wife ready to leave.

One of my other friend came in early to get the table for the reservation.  She was told there would be a long table for 7 people in the back. So, we walked to the back and there were a group of girls already sitting there. We came to the front desk to ask what happened. The front girl at the desk was kind of rude, insisting that there was a table for us already. She looked annoyed because she kept repeating the statement. We told her there were a group of people we didn't know already there. Apparently, they gave our table away.  I was baffled.  How does that happen?!

It was already 9 pm by now.  So we ordered a couple of pizookies; no big deal, right?  Shouldn't take too long.  The kids did have school the next day, but how long could it take?  35 minutes later, 5 minutes after I requested they cancel the pizookies, the waitress brings them out at last.  The kids were yawning and falling asleep, but their eyes lit up at the pizookies, so we let them enjoy and headed home around 10.  The worst thing was - and the waitress knew we were upset with the situation about the heaters and the entire wait - no apology, nothing.  Just ""Have a nice night.""  Very disappointing.  BJ's.  Really?  Never going back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=720,2.72,2.93,3.232,2.148,2.846

So this waiter comes back 15 minutes later with our drinks and no food. At this point my hungry side is coming out. We waited another 30 minutes until we smelled our food. Now that we had our food, my friend decided to ask for a side of ranch. The waiter (who we only saw like 3 times the whole time) nods his head and never comes back. So another 8 minutes pass by and another waiter walks by and we ask him for the side of ranch. I guess he also ignored us too. We were on our last slice of pizza when the ranch came out. It was such a slow and annoying experience that we decided not to order the pazookies and I love those things.

At the same time the sun was glaring off car windshields in the parking lot and that actually became worse than the sun, but those windows didn't even have the useless screens so nothing was offered.   I ordered salmon without the champagne butter sauce since I can not have dairy and when it came, it was covered in sauce.  They took it back and in about a half hour brought the salmon with no sauce.  They were kind enough to not charge us for it.  Next time we will NOT allow them to sit us in that space - which is to me a form of banishment for being bad or something.  I do not think that seven people would be too many for the restaurant proper to handle, especially since we were fairly early and there were no people waiting outside.  Other than the awful sun problem and wrong order, the servers were courteous and accommodating so that the evening was not a total disappointment, but pretty close to it.  Something needs to be done about the sun shining in the customer's eyes, even turning the tables 180 degrees would help some, but investing in opaque screens would eliminate half of my complaints about that room;  leaving the room for truly large and boisterous parties would make more sense.

I figured okay everyone makes mistakes, but about 10 minutes later when my cousin got her dish the order was wrong as well.

344,Paul T.,"Santa Ana, CA",163,211,723.0,2.0,2014-05-09,"I remember many years ago when BJ's was still a relatively new small chain and that I really liked the food here.  Maybe it's because the food scene has really improved over the last 5 years or my taste buds have evolved but I'm just not impressed with BJ's anymore. This was my 3rd time to a BJ's in the last year and I've been underwhelmed all 3 times.  This latest time, my niece chose BJ's for her bday dinner.  This location is pretty big and it was packed on a Thursday night. The server was cute and pleasant.   We order several small appetizer plates (calamari, fried artichokes and corn fritters with bacon aioli), a large deep dish pizza, parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes, and chicken limone with linguine.  We waited a good 20-25 minutes before any food arrived but then suddenly they brought all of the appetizers AND the pizza out at the same time.  A few minutes later, the two chicken plates arrived.  Unfortunately, the appetizers may have sat out while waiting to be delivered to our table because they were just lukewarm.  I'll usually eat anything that's deep-fried but even I wasn't that tempted by our appetizers to try more than a bit of each item.  Worse, the pizza was also only semi-hot.  The flavor of the pizza was really only just ok, especially since it wasn't piping hot.  The two chicken dishes tasted quite good but those were also not super hot.  We didn't send any food back but it was just disappointing that nothing was hot and the appetizers were quite bland.  My niece got a free mini-Pizookie topped with a scoop of ice cream.   What is all the fuss about the Pizookie??!  In my opinion, the cookie was really thin and too crusty. After leaving BJ's, I was really unsatisfied and almost hit up a food truck but I had already consumed too many unworthy calories at BJ's.  The next time someone suggests BJ's, I'm going to have to exercise my veto power!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=360,2.6,2.87,3.152,2.44,2.7620000000000005

I do like their pizza when I crave deep dish.  The service is usually above average just like it was this time.  Oh yeah, even though we didn't partake in the pizookie, don't forget they have it.

My most recent experience, I had a reservation for 12, arrived on time, only the front lady wouldn't let us sit until more than half the people. That is reasonable, which is fine, only I explained to her that we would prefer to be seated now to start ordering our food. My family always orders ""asian style"", or a more politically correct, ""family style"", and we always share our food. So getting that head start and ordering for the whole gang would not only save our time but their time. Needless to say, they wouldn't let us do that. When I come here, I always need to bring tums. The food is sooo oily I could wring it out to lube my car parts, my lover, as well as my hair - if oiled hair were still in style of course! Either way, I always get a massive heart burn after eating here. I would rather stick to the whole foods ""serve-your-self"" bar! The atmosphere is nice though! It's loud enough to transform awkward moments into comfortable ones, and release some gas, and quiet enough to make conversation. The food we ordered could be described as followed: Pizzas - too doughy and thick, salty, not flavored very well Salads - dry meats on top, dressings are okay Ribs - dry but came off the bone easily, but very very dry  Baby burgers - decent, it's just the average baby burger Cheese sticks - didn't have cheese, was just a fried case of missing cheese",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=380,2.72,2.85,3.12,2.6320000000000006,2.798

We have ordered different entrees from the menu when we don't feel like pizza but the problem lies with our salads. Not once, not twice, not even three times, but FIVE different times, they have brought the salads and the pizza at the same time so our pizza sits there and gets cold, they bring the salads out approximately 2-3 minutes before our meal comes out so we have just started to eat our salads and then our food just sets there getting cold once again OR they have just forgotten our salads all together! I don't get it, how hard is it to make a salad?! I have spoken to the manager several different times about this problem and he or she almost always takes care of the bill or something on the bill but still, I came for a relaxing meal, i should not have to worry about rushing through my starter bc my meal is sitting there getting cold!

We should have known better and gone to a mom's and pop's pizza joint, but because we were near the area...we said what the heck? We arrived and were told that it'd be a 15 minute wait, then another person stated that they could seat us. So...we didn't wait more than five minutes; which was great! Here comes the crappy part...our waitress (can't remember her name), was very kind to the rest of my party, but not me. I was the only female in our party and maybe she just decided that she could get away with giving me an attitude. I asked for a veggie pizza with gluten free crust. She stated that I couldn't order my pizza that way. I asked why, if I've never had a problem ordering the pizza that way in the past. She became visibly annoyed and responded in a very rude manner. She stated that a gluten free pizza was cheese only. I found that hard to believe and she took a deep breath and sighed. I told her that there was no reason for her to give me attitude and that I didn't appreciate the way that she was talking to me. Her attitude completely changed after I made her aware of her horrible personality and lack of dialogue.  Long story short...I ordered a veggie pizza (not gluten free), and it was bland, cold, and disgusting! I only had half of slice and sent it back. I then ordered a pan cheese pizza and that was also disgusting. Needless to say, I threw up a few times when I arrived home.

My boyfriend and I recently purchased a pazookie to take with us to the beach. A warm, chocolate-y treat with a sunset was the perfect evening date. However, when we parked the car and peeled open our pazookie we were horrified! Baked inside were several stringy black hairs. It was especially disgusting because we had already taken several bites. :( We knew the hairs could not be ours because they did not match the color and texture. Our romantic date dessert was totally ruined! We immediately looked up online to see if they had a customer service number...they don't! Which is very strange. They do have an e-mail option, but we prefer to speak to an actual person. So we decided to wait until we went again (we previously went very often) to report the situation. We went last night had a nice server. After we paid for our meal, we finally worked up the nerve to ask for the manager (pretty shy, lol) The manager came out immediately. He was friendly, responsive and seemed like he really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. Totally loved him. After we explained what had happened he thanked us for returning, and offered not just me and my boyfriend but our other two friends coupons for pazookies. There was a catch, however. You have to purchase an entree in order to get one    -_- kind of a disappointment, as we usually just go to grab dessert lol. But overall I will be returning, and have not had any other problems at this location. There was a name on the back of the coupon that said Tom, so if that's the manager, special shout out to him for really taking the care to make sure we were happy. He has a true gift for customer service. I had kept the receipt in my wallet to show them, but he didn't even ask to see it, which I thought was really amazing.

Nobody that works here is warm or welcoming. The servers could care less about their tables. Everyone is disengaged and they make you feel as if you are a burden on them and taking up their time.  Earlier I was in and ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, half of it with olives added. When I received my pizza only 2 of the pieces were with out olives, so It made it difficult because I was with 3 small children, 2 of which do not like olives. .

298,James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1105,935,1830.0,1.0,2014-08-04,"BJ's - you've made it to my one star list! The service on the night that I came was excruciatingly slow. We had a table of 7 people and used this night to catch up since we had a friend who flew in town for the week. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant seemed like it was pretty full. Our first server took our drink order and shortly after, was gone for the evening. She introduced us to the person who was going to ""take care of us"" the rest of the night. The first server looked unhappy to be there, not at all pleasant so it seemed like a huge plus we were getting someone else. The second person was slightly better but something was definitely going on in the kitchen because our food came out so slow. At different points of the night, we couldn't flag down our server (to get drink refills, to order dessert, to pay for our bill). It was mind numbingly slow! To top it all off, the pizza I got was pathetic and I try not to be so harsh in my reviews but I have nothing kind to say about it. I ordered the Great White and there was nothing great about it. I felt like they skipped the sauce or something so it was literally pizza dough and toppings. Normally, I would send it back or bring it to thr server's attention, but if you read the few paragraphs above, that would send us into another time warp until anything would come out correctly. I was sorely disappointed this night and have no intentions to come back. As much as I like the pizookie, I really can't have my patience tested like this anymore- we all don't have time for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=140,2.96,2.81,3.072,2.244,2.87

Phoned in an order around 9pm for a bbq chicken pizza. I arrive 35 min walk in to pick up my take out.  The guy at the register tells me he can't find my order. I told him are you serious you told me to come in 30 min and you don't have my order ready. He goes in the kitchen to double check  comes out empty handed and said sorry but at the time of the order you placed the registers got rebooted and the order probably got lost. Tired of arguing I said if you knew it rebooted you should have made sure it went in or jus hand write it it's common sense. He basically jus said ya they can make it right now if you can wait 30 min. Pretty much defeats the purpose of doing a take out. No apologies and didn't do anything to make the situation right.

I called the waitress over and she said that they can't do pizza without sauce and it was ""only a little"" clearly this woman has no idea what an ALLERGY is. I saw nothing on the menu, nor on the BJ's website saying that you can't get a pizza without tomato sauce. As I clearly ordered my pizza without sauce she should have told me when I ordered so that I could pick something else. To add insult to injury she did not take the pizza off the bill despite the fact that I could not eat it. Our waitress was not only rude after the pizza was made wrong but she hardly checked on us and it took nearly a half hour to find her to order dessert (aka my dinner).

I have not had a bad experience (at this location) ever! They are open pretty late for a restaurant... closing at 12-1 AM. I'm here a lot for their happy hour too. Food: You can't go wrong with the pizza here; both the flatbreads and the deep dish pizzas are awesome. But honestly, you can really get full and get your money's worth if you know what you are doing. They have a small-bites section for only $4-5 each dish. I don't know why but their small-bites mac and cheese is really filling! I order this for my meal + pizookie = I'm already full. Check out their fried artichoke and their small salads too! Also, utilize their happy hour! They have $4-6 dishes, and their spinach dip and buffalo wings are very good too! You can get half of a flatbread pizza for $4, which is good for the late night food cravings. As for their pizookies, if you know you aren't going to finish a whole one to yourself or your friends want different things, you can order the mini's for a cheaper prices.  Drinks: WOW, you must try their water. It's the best water I've ever had. Just kidding.. but seriously check out their beers! They have good house craft beers, especially their brand. The pale ale and the hefe are awesome. They also carry other craft beers as well and some of them are not listed on their menu. You have to be a loser like me and walk from one end of the bar to another to see which craft beers on tap they have. For example, the menu did not have Bootlegger's Palomino Pale Ale. However, in the corner of my eye, I saw the beer tap handle on one end of the bar. I saw Green Flash and Stone IPA as well. So keep your eye out for the beers that you want!

485,Lauren V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,22,,1.0,2014-10-05,"Wow this was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant my family and I have had in a long time. We came to eat here last night for my nephew's b-day with a party of 13. This will be long so bare with me.. I'll start with our server: As soon as my sister asked her if we could have the dreaded separate checks, we detected attitude and much irritation.  She took our drink orders and then unbelievably asked us, ""can you find out what they want to drink over there?"" referring to the teens sitting at the end of our long table. Yeah maybe it had been a long night for her but really? You can't walk over there and ask yourself?? Like isn't that part of your job? Then when asked what kind of dressings they had for the salads, she replied ""just the normal dressings"".  Hmm normal dressings.. as opposed to abnormal dressings?  So we were done ordering, or so we thought, and then she asked my sister with a hefty dose of attitude: ""So wait I'm not really sure whats going on here, like, is your son sharing the pizza with you or is he ordering something or what?"" My sister replied that she already ordered his plate. It was just a wierd question, what does it matter if he was sharing the pizza or not, that's not the way a server should ask a question! At that point we felt uncomfortable and annoyed ourselves and we hadn't even eaten yet, so my sister got up and asked the manager for a different server. He apologized and agreed and a much more nice, genuine server came over a few mins later. But not long after, she was still coming to our table, but only the other end where the teens and a couple family members were sitting. She would bring a refill or clear plates but ONLY on that end. Strange. Why didn't the manager have her switch with someone else helping a different table or something? Nothing like making our dinner awkward now with her being overly fake-friendly on that end and walking by our end so fast and hastily that a breeze would blow by every time. Anyhow we wanted to have a nice dinner so we ignored it. Next I'll proceed with the douche-like behavior of the manager: Our brother in law was a little intoxicated and had the genius idea to give nephew who had just turned 16 a taste of one of his beers from a flight he ordered. As soon as we noticed we stopped him and told him he couldn't do that! After that we see the manager with arms folded standing there watching our table. So at that time we're tasting our pizza that came a couple minutes before and it is LUKEWARM, no wood-fired crusty taste, more of a bread consistency, and overall tasted like a frozen grocery store version of a BJ's pizza. Not to mention the 'seasoned tomatoes' on top were straight out of a can and looked disgusting. I know because my mom has bought those canned tomatoes before and there's no mistaking them.  Anyway back to the manager. Since he was standing there eyeballing us we asked if we could have the pizza heated up, he comes over and says sure and then quickly says something about how they do not allow underage and drinking and if WE do that again we all will have to leave. My sister explains WE had nothing to do with it and before she could say any more he rushed off. He was unfriendly from that point on, and service seemed to go down the toilet even faster. Not yet finished with our meal, we see the server coming over with the birthday ice cream scoop with candle on top. It was pretty obvious we were still eating and not quite ready for that moment yet. But I can only assume it was the manager's hint to rush us out of there since we all were guilty by association. The server set the dessert down and when asked if they sing happy b-day he said ""we don't do that here"". I felt like a dessert myself so I ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Again it seemed like the oven or microwave must've been broken because my beignet was a little tough and barely lukewarm. Ughh disappointing.. Not the dreamy dessert I remembered from last time. Here comes the final blow to a huge let down of a meal and service: We asked for the manager so we could clarify we had nothing to do with bro in law offering beer to teen and we quickly shut it down as soon as we saw it. At first he denied my suggestion that service took an even worse turn because of that, but then he acknowledged that 'it did alter his perception' whatever that means. He reminded us that he could've kicked us all out but he didn't, and when asked why the server who was rude still continued to come to our table, he said 'we all help each other out and this was her area to serve. Um ok.. then why agree to a new server??  He was very sarcastic, nothing on the bill was comped (not that that was our goal, but it's typical of a manager to do that to make up for bad service!), and continued to blame us all for one person's mistake. We all agreed he didn't have the balls to go up to the culprit himself and instead took it out on us ladies. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=480,2.68,2.79,3.02,2.372,2.7460000000000004

I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a big event in my life and we were seated, served and treated with respect by the waitress until a giant cricket jumped on our table, in front of my wife and scared the living Christ out of us. The cricket proceeded to jump all around the table, booth, bench and over my wife several times as the bus boy was swatting at it  with his cleaning cloth. Wow, ok well my wife and I had seen enough so we asked for the bill because we were not about to dine with the cricket guts all over our table area.  The waitress was very busy so my wife went to the hostess booth to explain what happened and the hostess was very polite and demanded that we explain what happened to the manager. This is where it all went down hill...... Manager: ""You had to talk to me about something?"" (angry and upset that we pulled him away from some seemingly important undertaking) Wife: ""There was a giant cricket on our table and we are ready to go eat somewhere else because we lost our Bj's appetite.""

When someone places the order, they throw the toppings that were ordered on the pizza, put it in the oven for just a few minutes to let the cheese melt and serve. Why did it take me so many years to figure this out? This is the only logical answer. This has been an ongoing discussion for years with the group that I go to BJ's with.

I have also gone to the one in Carlsbad when I lived over there and that is where I discovered the super scrum diddly umptious Jalapeño burger they have! Sooooo goooddddd lol. This BJs, however gave us pretty good service the first time. The wait wasn't too long and we had a nice experience. Last night we called ahead and spoke to a very nice employee named Autumn. She explained the wait time was 25 minutes so we asked to be added on the wait list. We drove over there as soon as we got off the phone with her. We arrived about 20 minutes later and noticed how packed it was and went up to the hostess to let her know we were there. She said she would call us once our table was ready. About 30 minutes pass by and we still hadn't got called. I don't have an issue with the wait because I saw how busy they were but I was wondering why we even called ahead and got on a wait list if we were going to end up waiting like we just arrived there anyway? I'm guessing it's just to make customers feel better. We ended up waiting the time like everyone else who just got there which kind of was a fail for us thinking we were covered on the wait list already.

In between all that, when we finally got our food the burger was barely warm like it had been sitting a while,  never got our appetizer first but instead with our meals, went through 2 different servers to ask for napkins water and the side they didn't put on our meal in the first place. The waitress comes by 10 minutes after we get our food to finally bring a water refill and asks if we need anything,  but by that time I had already asked for the manager. After I tell the manager about the prolonged wait we've had with service, he remakes the burger but doesn't even give a discount or comp the burger. I'm sorry but this whole situation could of been handled a lot better.

251,Katherine A.,"Long Beach, CA",27,45,26.0,3.0,2014-12-15,Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon to have some lunch with my husband in between some shopping. It was pretty busy because of Sunday football. We sat in the bar and waited about 10 minutes until someone brought us menus. I was really craving a Bloody Mary and I was greatly disappointed. The Bloody Mary was bland and tasted like tomato sauce. I had to fix it by adding some lime to cut the thickness and sweetness of the tomato flavor.  Our waitress was very nice. I ordered the Asian chop salad which was okay  the lettuce was old but I as starving so I devoured it.

They still have their staples like pizza and pizzookies (yay!) but I wish they would go back to their old menu.  Service at this location is not great. It takes a long time for a server to come by your table, they do not check on you that often and the kitchen is slow. Last time we didn't have place setting and when the food got dropped off to us it took us 5 minutes to flag someone down to get some so that those of us in the party who had dishes that required silverware could eat.

Would not mind this if they were busy. But it was not. When the food came to the table we did not have any place settings. That took another several minutes to get while the food was getting cold. The server really did not check on us. We had to ask for more drinks. Let's not talk about how the menu has changed. This has not changed for the better. They need to bring back the old menu.

We had no wait like I like told the attendant we were celebrating  my wife's Bday and a getaway from the Kids,. Our waiter took our orders and it went down hill from there. She got wine and i Ice tea . Well  asked for lemon which didn't come with it and no sugar  on the table.  After waiting a bit for dinner, remember we were early and it wasn't busy our burger ,came which would be great but we ordered  salads that came  after our burger , umm normally u eat the salad them ur dinner arrives. Our waiter offered to take the burger and keep it warm under the lamp while we enjoyed our salad, well  NO cuz then the bun would be mushy just please bring us some ketchup. Always found it cool that somehow ketchup at restaurants always seem to be fULL , guess not at BJs got a few funny noise squirts but very little stuff so had to wait and ask for more not to mentions n that my tea was dry so much of the time. Almost done with dinner when my wife says SOMETHINGS missing!! Hmm we ordered a bacon cheese burger but no cheese on the order, cheese make things just better, well we pointed this last error out to our server, he said he'd take care of it,, we watched as we had a great view of the front desk, he told the manager and she looked abit pissy  shrugged and he came back with a 2 dollar bill adjustment , and they ignored the birthday celebration we were doing , I was ready to just get the heck outta there but my wife approached the same manager that dealt with our waiter and told our story, she apologized and refunded our meal, with our few times out and away woulda been glad to have a memorable nice uneventful dinner instead, wasn't worth the time  for a substandard experience ,  we have been refunded but I post this to warn others as well as get the management to tune things up so others can have a better  dinning experience, had that manager came to our table when she first  learned about the problem this post would have been different, REMEMBER we saw our waiter tell u what had happened",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=660,2.68,2.8,2.936,2.6280000000000006,2.7520000000000002

643,Tyrell H.,"Bellflower, CA",6,3,1.0,1.0,2015-01-18,"I went there yesterday with a friend for lunch after shopping and it was pretty much bad from the time we walked in the door. We walked up and asked to be seated and the manager and the host were basically arguing about where to sit us. I'm guessing they didn't want to since they just assumed we wanted to be in the bar. We had to tell them both that we did not want to be seated in the bar. After their show we got seated the server was quick to bring the things we ordered but not to be found between. We waited a very long time to receive our food and when we got our plates. The rice on both out plates was hard aka Half Cooked. We didn't eat and we got our food to go. The server dropped off our check and disappeared we waited a few minutes then we just walked up and asked the manger if she could split out check for us because we were both paying with our cards. ... This evil woman rolled her eyes and iad okay  so I told her what was mine and what was my friends and she said oh no. I'll split it down the middle. That was not okay because I spent more money than my friend on purpose knowing I would pay for it. But she did not care. So then I asked her what we would each be paying and she says I don't know between 24 and 30 dollars. And I asked her the exact amount and she again rolled out her eyes and took out her phone to give us our totals then I take10$ out of my pocket and tell her to use that and charge my card for the rest. She gives my card and my cash to the server and told him she didn't know what the cash was and told him it was his tip and he walked away and she said ""is that all""  I never said anything to her while I was there because it would have been really ugly. I think what I asked for was pretty simple and I don't think the manager at this location is good for the company I have been eating at bjs for years and this was by far the worst. I could have gone to Denny's for that service I don't understand how we waited an hour and got terrible service and halfcooked food.

I came here with my family, 11 of us, for my moms birthday on a Sunday at 3pm. First we had a waitress who took our drink order, while half of the table received our drinks the other did not and then a 2nd waitress came who was taking over for the first waitress. She told us she would be our new waitress and that the other one was off but was starting our order since the new waitress had to go the bathroom :/. Gross. I did not want to think about my waitress using the bathroom ""for a while"" before she was getting my food. She then retook our drink order for those who weren't served yet. When she came back with drinks and started taking our food order she started complaining that she was waitressing at all since she was always in the bar serving drinks and that ""they decided hey she's here let's send her out to waitress for an entire room"" and told another table she'll get to them when she can and quietly said even if it does take me 20 minutes to get there. We ordered our food and a salad and an appetizer that she said she'd bring right out. The salad never came and the appetizer came with the food. But before it came we had another waitress change. This waitress was nice and good and the best by far. Before the other waitress left she told us our food will be right out only about 10 more minutes-we had already been waiting at least 20 minutes. The food finally came-2 of ours anyway. Then a couple minutes later they brought out 4 more plates and 3 of them were wrong. Wrong fries, no cheese on burger, no tomatoes on pizza. The fries were replaced quickly, the tomatoes took about 10 minutes, and the cheese never came. In the meantime 3 of us were still waiting for our food. We complained that the table was half way done with their food and the others hadn't even arrived. Finally another plate came out-wrong fries again. Also the gm came over to us. What a creep! My husband explained the situation and there was no apology, no rush, no movement from this guy. Instead he justified it saying that he was not another server ""just the general manager"" and was trying to make it better. My husband said just bring the food out so we can eat. He said I understand sir and we are working on that but in the meantime please understand we're working on it and doing what we can. All while leaning on a chair next to us wanting to debate rather than fix. I said just go get the food please we do t need a discussion. He stared at me with an asshole look stood up and rolled his eyes and turned and walked away while shaking his head. I said to my husband ""what an asshole"". He turned around and walked back over to us saying there was no reason for name calling and he did not appreciate that type of language in his restaurant. What?! My husband explained again how there were STILL 2 people waiting for their plates and he was MUCH more concerned with my ""name calling"" and needing to battle us. We literally had to tell him just please go and get our food-sternly. He left and came back with no food asking the people now what did you order that you're waiting for. So after they ordered again about 2 minutes later one plate came-wrong fries. We asked again for the right fries and the tomatoes. The tomatoes finally came the right fries never did. But the gm came back and asked the last person what they ordered, this was the 4th time she ordered. As he asked her I, in my husbands ear, quietly said he's taking her order again! He was STARING at me not even paying attention to her because he was so worried about what I was saying to my husband. He gave me a dirty look my husband told him to stop looking at his wife that way he then said ok and went to the end of the table to ask once more what she had ordered. She said just cancel it and shared with people at the table. He then went to the bar and was pointing us out-literally-to a guy sitting at the bar! A few minutes later he came back knelt down whispering to my mom who's birthday it was how she liked her food that she finally got and then told her that the entire tables bill would be covered. That was impressive considering his behavior before. But I feel he owed me and especially my husband the explanation since it was my husband he was dealing with and an apology. He never once apologized to any of us. The waitress did many times. She was great and we left her a BIG tip. He, even though waived the bill, was just so bad and uncomfortable. It was a very weird uncomfortable situation. He was extremely creepy in his manner. I seriously can not believe and have NEVER seen a manager behave and battle in the way he did. It was SO bad.

I decided on BJ's, which is typically a safe bet for a simple combo of pizza and beer, but ventured out of the box slightly, similar to my newest slave drone, who is boxed into a void of pikerdom. My caesar salad arrived and I quickly felt my stomach turn the way it did just a few days ago, when the news of my wingman was dropped on me. have you ever received a caesar salad with american shredded cheese on top? no? because that's what I got. it reminded me of the frozen recycled salad bar at Chuck E Cheese, except with no pitcher of piss beer and skeeball to dull the pain. perhaps this appetizer portion of sliders would do the job. A few drinks later, I was stonefaced and ready for anything. but even though i asked for them with cheese and caremalized onions, I received literally just black meat and a cold bun with a shit squirt of ketchup and fossilized lettuce on the side. as I stared down at the comically tragic mess on my plate, I felt rage boil within my soul. to add insult to injury, I had to listen to the dick sponge waitresses gossip and hoot endlessly, a siren song that felt like a cheese grater on my tender brain. When I sent back the sliders, the final straw came, as one of the faceless broads, not knowing I was the one who sent them back, piked up and cheerfully squawked, ""oh I love the sliders! they're, like, the reason I work here!""

I don't think the food has gone down hill, I just think I've been enlightened by many delicious foods so now BJ's is mediocre. It sure does the job though. We ordered potato skins, BBQ Chicken Pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. Potato Skins These potato skins are fried then adorned with cheese, bacon bits, and chives. Very tasty but the potatoes themselves could use some work. They were dry and hard.  BBQ Chicken Pizza Again, I used to LOVE BJ's but I found my recent trip to be overwhelmingly underwhelming. The pizza crust was soggy, the bbq sauce tasted artificial and the chicken tasted frozen. I was very unsatisfied with this pizza. Pizookie The pizookie was perfect!! It's a warm, soft and gooey freshly baked chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Scrumdiddlyumptious! Our waiter was not anything out of the ordinary. It was a day before my sister's birthday so I asked her if she could bring a surprise pizookie to the table while my sister was in the bathroom. I guess homegirl forgot and asked us if we wanted dessert after we were done with our meals. Super awkward because I tried to lowkey remind our waiter that I had already asked her to bring us a surprise pizookie. Our waiter couldn't pick up my hints so I had to blow the surprise and remind her in front of my sister. Annoying but whatever  Meh, I'll probably be back but NOT when I'm expecting a quality meal.

It may not be the best pizza, but  If I am looking for a good inexpensive deep dish this end of the OC, I know BJ's can always deliver.  Pizza is something that the Beast and I always agree on, its got to have a lot of meat, lots of sauce and lots cheese on it. And Anchovies on the side. But lately, I have been more accommodating to his needs and allow half the pizza to have his silly little fishes. And you know what? There is zero fishjuice on my half.  We have also learned to alter their standard pizzas and add extra sauce, extra cheese and order it well done, to ensure its cooked all the way through. Sometimes, with multiple toppings the crust does not always cook to our liking, so that extra few minutes in the oven really helps. A large satisfies us and we can usually finish the whole pie ourselves.  If I we dont share the large pizza I order one of the chicken dishes, The Parmesan chicken and balsamic glazed chicken are amazing, and some of my favorite dishes ever. Washed down with the berry peach iced tea. To finish things off, we usually share the white chocolate macadamia nut Pizzookie with ice cream. Service here is never consistent. Which is why the 3 stars.  It is like a roller coaster, up and down, up and down. It makes me dizzy. Tonight our service started out good. I was actually surprised how good it was. But then our waitress got a little busy, disappeared, missed us waving her down  and forgot our drink refills after removing our cups from our table. Then they changed shifts. So we got a new waitress.  Service was in slow motion, at the end of our meal as we waited for our to go  box and check. Then the new server forgot our coupon. *sigh*. In the end everything was resolved and we left full and satisfied. What I noticed is, the other servers in the same sections do not have each other's backs. They don't seem aware of their fellow servers tables needs or tap off their drinks, remove plates, notify your server the customer needs them, ect. It took a few minutes to get our servers attention and the other servers were completely oblivious.  The kitchen crew on the other hand, seem, to be in sync with everyone. Once they bring your order out, they are quick to bring you any condiments you might need.   I also noticed the other patrons around us were pretty much all needing the same things. Checks, to go boxes, drinks, ect. We all must of sat down around the same time. That also makes it difficult to have excellent service. The tiny tables for 2 are not the greatest if your having pizza. There is not enough room for the pizza, the drinks, and a conversation. Its hard to see the person your talking to, if a pizza is in your face, or your worried the pizza is going to fall off the table.

( only fans since you're not inside the building). To start the tables were set and I was impressed with that. However we had specifically requested that only brunch be able to be ordered and me and a worker had to turn the pages in a hurry. My mom planned the shower and was told there was no time limit when she asked. They had her give a final headcount two weeks prior and still no warning of a time limit. The staff though lovely and nice weren't really looking at the clock and managing the group very well. It felt like they cared more about ringing up the mimosa bill vs giving us actual food. Most people liked their food by the time we got it however some got half scrambled eggs and microwaves potatoes. I get that brunch isn't their speciality but it really was unfortunate. With the clock nearing 1245 a group came in with balloons and the manager warned us we had 15 minutes left. Something the guests and myself weren't prepared for. I definitely wouldn't recommend having any sort of event here if you can't fit everything in 2 hours. With having people arrive late and socialize it's not enough time to settle down eat and not be rushed.

I sat and waited for the rest of the dishes to come... and waited, and waited... We're thinking they gave me another tables order, because then the rest finally came out all together. And then another salmon quinoa dish was delivered to our table a few minutes later (that one was probably mine, even though it was much later than the others). The first salmon quinoa looked like it had been sitting out under the heating lamp for a bit and the chef skimped on the veggies, so the waitress just gave me the second one as compensation.

You would think they should refer to menu items by the names on the menu. But, no biggie. Of course, the pizookies were delish. I had never had the Salted Caramel before and it is my new favorite. My friend also ordered the beignet for us to share. That was truly disappointing. I've had beignets several times at different locations. They are always small bites you can eat with your fingers and they usually come with a dipping sauce. This beignet was about the size of a hamburger. It was drenched with strawberry sauce and ice cream with a few sliced berries. It was soft and doughy, like eating underbaked bread. Bleh! Lesson learned, just won't order that again.  For the most part, our service was very good. Our waitress, Susan P, was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have to wait too long for anything. Until the end. She brought the check. In less than 2 minutes, we were ready to pay. The little book was standing up, my credit card was sticking out. She walked past our table several times and never picked it up. After 20 minutes, we had to wave her down so we could pay and leave. That is one of my biggest pet peeves and will almost always result in a smaller tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=360,2.68,2.88,2.852,2.184,2.8000000000000003

Good food and good service. Sure, I've been here on the crazy busy weekends where servers don't come check on you every five minutes. Who likes that, anyway? When you come on busy nights, if you are the sort of person who expects to be waited on hand and foot, I urge you to reconsider and just eat at home in your castle with your servants, not out with us common folk. Some highlights ... + 5.75 for a kids' meal. Choose your entree, type of side (ours enjoyed the smiley-face fries especially) and a drink. + Lunch deals, Mon-Fri until 3p. Kind of limited, but kind of awesome. Cheap prices on pizza, pastas, and sandwiches. We did the lunch pasta. It comes with your choice of soup or salad and is $1 cheaper than the normal pasta price. The lunch size still filled me up. Clam chowder was good. Served warm-hot. The Cajun chicken pasta was also good. Served piping hot. + Cheaper beers for lunch hour! Jeremiah Red is a good fruity choice and still has a 7.something ABV. Normally $5.50 a pint, came to about $3 during lunch time. + Friday afternoon, 2:30. Slow! Score. Server Cory was very friendly and attentive, but not too much so that it's annoying. He even offered to get my iced tea to go as we were paying! That was really cool. Here's the order .... tropical iced tea (free refills), chicken tender kids' meal with smiley fries and apple juice (served in a small cup with a lid, thank you), California chicken flat bread appetizer, two lunch orders of the Cajun chicken pasta with clam chowder, and a pint ... came to $48 after tax.

Mind you plenty of people have walked by us and not one person stopped to ask if we had been helped. My boyfriend and I had a question about some stuff and finally caught the manager and asked him. I wonder if he wondered why we didn't ask our server..hmm. Finally, our server brought out our waters and then bailed again to drop off water refills to another table. He expressed how it was his 2nd day and it was so much to learn. He apologized profusely, but still has yet to take our order. About 15 minutes has gone by since we sat down and all we have are our waters. Once we finally got our order taken the waiting began again. We ordered the 2 for 25 deal, meaning we literally ordered everything at that one point to our server...never saw him again. We waited another 15 minutes and the soups we ordered never came, I stopped him as he had been walking up and down his table section and he said he'd check on our salads. We ordered soups. He came back out and said ""has my manager been by about the soup? I was just told we were out of clam chowder and they are making you a new one now."" I asked to speak to the manager, a lousy excuse for one at that. He said he was sorry gave the same story about the soups and said our pizza was up. I told him if the pizza was ready to just bring it out and we'll figure out the soups later. He said ok I'll get everything going. 5 more minutes went by. I know that doesn't seem like a lot but when you're hungry it's a lifetime. My boyfriend and I decided we would give them 60 seconds to bring out our pizza or we were gonna bail and drive thru somewhere.

260,Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43.0,1.0,2015-10-15,"Some friends and I went to your location to watch the Raiders vs. Broncos game. When we arrived all of the TVs in the restaurant were on other NFL games from all around the league. When those games had finished we asked our server if one of the TVs could please be changed to the Raiders game? The response we received was ridiculous. She stated ""We do not show Raiders games here, this is a family restaurant."" At first we thought she was joking with us, but when the Rams fan at the table next to us turned around and asked her, ""That's a joke right?"" She again stated ""We do not show Raiders games in this restaurant because this is a family restaurant."" She then went on to say that she would ask the manager, when she returned she told us they said no, and we would have to go somewhere else. At that point we sent back everything we ordered and we left. I do not understand how you can advertise that your establishment is the place to go to watch the NFL. But yet do not allow certain people to do so based on who they cheer for? We were told that Raiders games cause violence, foul language and chaos in the restaurant. So because we cheer for the Oakland Raiders we are profiled as violent, foul, and trouble makers? For this we will NEVER step foot in any one of your establishments again. Raiders fans are not all foul, violent, or problem starters, but what we are is a FAMILY, and in your managers own words this FAMILY is not welcome in your ""family"" restaurant. I wonder if we had asked to put on the Broncos game, the channel would've been changed, but we were profiled as Raiders so basically asked to leave. I wonder if this is a corporate decision or if a server, bartender, or manager is making the executive decision to exclude teams. Maybe y'all should just put up a sign, the place to watch the NFL, except the Raiders. Wait, is it just the Raiders? My wife likes the Patriots, do you side that Pats are cheaters and not show their games? What about Dodgers, again there was just another beating over the Dodgers? Riots happen after Lakers playoffs, do you not show Lakers games?  Not like I am a huge fan of your restaurants, I cannot think of a single positive experience. Maybe someone at corporate should read the reviews, or read my reviews, there are several, and I believe they all highlight negative experiences around service. And your mediocre food does not make up for horrible service.

This review is mostly about their service, as their food is pretty good and I don't have any issues with. Location: Right off the 405 and Beach. Parking lot can get busy at times depending on when you come. Service: I'm usually not picky on service, but as someone who works in the service industry, this has got to be an all time low for me. The person that served us was obviously training because he had a guy right behind him the entire time watching his every move.  First mistake was not introducing himself, or the person behind him. Second off our waters were forgotten, and didn't come until 15 mins later when we reminded our server. I would have understood if it was a super busy night, but there were a lot of empty tables and they seemed very staffed.  After we ordered, our party of 4 changed to a party of 6 because 2 more of our friends decided to join us. We advised our server that we needed a bigger table and he said we will get one very shortly. Our 2 friends arrived really soon. The server sees that our group of 4 grew to 6, yet he said nothing. 15-20 mins arrive and we remind him that we are a party of 6 now and we need a new table. He says he's working on it still and then our food proceeds to come. One of our friends wanted to order something, flagged down one of the workers (who i believe was a food runner). That guy flat out told my friend he wasn't our server and just walked away continuing to do what he was doing. That's the first time I've ever experienced that kind of service. No matter what your job is, busser, runner etc. you don't tell a guest I'm not your server and just walk away. At the most you could have said I'm not your server, but I can get your server to see what you would like to add etc.   So finally 20 mins in, we get our table switch. We notice some some of the food were wrong. Fries were forgotten on my order, but they quickly fixed that. We had our sort of private patio room which was nice, and the server kept checking up on us. However the damage was already done as we all felt like the service started really bad. This being the Huntington Beach location and the headquarters just across the street, I expected their service to be at least decent. What a shame.  Drinks and Food: My favorite beer here to get is the Jeremiah Red. It's their signature beer, which is a strong ale and one of my favorite ones to get when I come here. The food is pretty good.

We asked if they could turn the air up. They said sure no problem. Our drinks came then our food. There was a manager that checked on the temp. Nothing was done. The waiters we're bringing out the food and complaining themselves on how hot it was where we were sitting. We asked to be moved because we could no longer handle the heat. The waitress said no problem I will be right back. The manager comes out again with keys and unlocks the air and tells us it should get cool in 5-10 minutes. The air finally comes on 5 minutes before we were finished eating. We spent around 400$ on food and drinks. What a waste of money. We come here all the time. This Bj's is going down hill quickly. Not to mention the time before  this one was a horrible experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=380,2.84,2.58,2.792,2.404,2.684
234,Chels C.,"Rossmoor, CA",6,29,22.0,5.0,2016-01-01,This place has a great vibe. I find that sitting at the bar is just as awesome as sitting at a regular booth. Not to mention the service is faster. The main dish to eat here is the pizza. You'd be crazy not to try the house root beer that they make. It's a nice mix between Barq's and IBC. The PIZOOKIE speaks for itself. The trio pizookie is your best bet because you can try 3 different amazing pizookies at once. It's a little pricey but so worth it. Craft matters as they say..basically this is a great place for the best beers and the cocktails are pretty neat too. :) happy eating!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=240,2.92,2.59,2.808,2.804,2.7219999999999995

411,Brandon Edward B.,"Cerritos, CA",118,23,3.0,3.0,2016-01-07,"I would love and actually want to give this review five stars. Don't get me wrong, this BJ's always has the best tasting food and rarely do I ever get a bad waiter/waitress, they're usually really nice and even good looking to top it off. The reason it's only three stars is the food is great and has good prices but the appetizers are the price of an entree but half the size or extremely less! Also, the reason this BJ's specifically gets three stars is because of how long it takes to get seated and get your order taken. There was once where I had to wait forty five minutes for my reservation and the entire left side of the room was empty and people who came in after me were seated first. Before that incident, I would have given it a 5-star.

My table got nachos and fried calamari as our appetizers which were very good and tasty. For the entree, I ordered the balsamic chicken which was also pretty good, but I wouldn't get it again due to a weird wine-ish taste. My brother got a candle-lit pizookie as his birthday dessert which was cute although none of the waiters joined in to sing him a happy birthday song which was sad.

The hostess couldn't even walk us to the dirty table she pointed to or even hand over a menu. We sat waiting for the server to come over and that never happen. So we sat observing the employees. The hostess chatting with two co-workers. Three other servers outside bar area. Austin was too busy texting to see us sitting without even a menu. I asked him if he would be our server and he said no. ""How dare I interrupt him texting!"" We walked out. Went across the street to CPK and the service was night and day. Had a great meal, awesome drinks, fantastic server...& hand down the best service. As for BJ's goes... This is not a good representation of the restaurant. You can get better service at our local Brea location. The Manager Mike needs to either fix this place or BJ's needs to get a better Manager. I would never run a business like this.

Let me give you the run-down on my experience [today]  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken, and it came with a side of mashed potatoes.  I wanted a full BAKED potato instead, so the waiter, Cory, was kind enough to switch my potatoes to a baked potato instead of mashed.  Okay, first trip of my order:  The sour cream and the butter both were on the side, when I wanted to get all of them ON TOP of the potato like people usually do.  So, they took my plate back, and the chef put the chives, butter, and sour cream on top for me.  Second trip:  I didn't see the pepper gravy on my chicken, so I kindly asked them to put the gravy on top of the chicken.  They put the gravy on top of the chicken.  Yes, I know those are small issues, but I'm sometimes OCD about things like that - again, not to say it's a bad thing, but on the other hand, I'm not Mr. Perfect. :)  All in all, the food (and service) today was at par, so I may try again another day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=60,2.96,2.7,2.832,2.8000000000000003,2.8040000000000003
339,Criselle M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",60,22,9.0,1.0,2016-02-23,"I am insanely disappointed in my visit to BJ's this afternoon. My friend and I got to the restaurant at 11:40 and were seated pretty promptly and ordered right away because we already knew what we wanted. I ordered the dinner sized portion of the salmon and quinoa and my friend ordered the salad with ahi tuna. We waited for our order for 40 minutes, finally at 12:30 we asked for our food which had not come out yet to be bagged as take out for us to just take back to work and eat. The server, Ryan, was very nice, and informed us that the salmon usually takes 15 minutes to cook. But from being seated and ordering at 11:50am to not receiving our food until after 40 minutes of waiting did not make up for the fact it took twice as long to cook my 15 minute salmon. Now here is the real kicker. Once I did get to open my to-go box up expecting to see a dinner portion of salmon and quinoa, I am met with less than a cup of quinoa scattered around my salmon. I've had the lunch portion of salmon and quinoa bowl at the BJ's in Torrance, and what was in my to-go box did not even measure up to that. There was probably enough asparagus and mushrooms, and the salmon was a good size, but did they not even think that I would notice that I had at most 4 spoonfuls of quinoa as my dinner entrée? I took a picture and will post it after I finish this little rant. But I hope that you who are reading this know that BJs had poor service at lunch time, middle of the week on a Tuesday, and that they bamboozle you with their take-out food. I am 100% sure they knew that I was getting a substandard portion for a lunch and dinner portion, and that absolutely disgusts me. Shame on you cooks!

From what I've seen and what my close friends and family have told me, the waiters and waitresses will either make your experience a good one or a very bad one.  On the good days, a waiter will seat us in the appropriate size booth/table, take my order while asking all the right questions, and deliver the food after 25 minutes (which is not bad during their busiest times).  On the bad days, they will seat you in a very cramped location, it will take about 20 minutes for a waiter to even approach you to ask what you're ordering, and over half an hour later the food comes in somewhat cold. I'm not saying I'll never come back to this BJ's, it's one of the few restaurants close to home that feels more appropriate for a nice restaurant dinner than the other places in Bella Terra.

425,Jessica E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,11,,1.0,2016-06-02,"I made reservations for my roommates surprise birthday party at this location over a month ago for the patio. We went tonight and I was surprised to hear my guests tell me that the manager came out and told them to hurry up and eat bc they have another table coming at 8:15. I had my roommate come about a half an hour after the guests were there so that it was a surprise. We ordered right when we got there and I asked the waiter about what the manager had told the guests. He said don't worry about it and to enjoy our time. My mother went to the bathroom and overheard the manager talking rudely about our group and saying we had been there two hours and needed to leave. We had been super nice to our waitress and were very quick with eating and ordering. When one of the guests approached the manager about what my mother had heard, she shrugged it off and said I don't know what you're talking about. No apology, nothing. He didn't even come out to the table to say sorry or anything which we would have forgiven him if he did. Instead he stood there and gave us dirty looks and continued to talk trash about us. I know it's cliche to say but I have been a loyal customer of this location for years, as has my roommate which is why I chose the location and I've never been so offended at a place of Buisness before. Our waitress was still tipped nicely because she was very nice and caught in a bad situation, but myself and all of my guests(15) will not be eating at this location again. We were even worried that he may have done something to our food after the way we were treated. I just don't understand, I work in a well known retail location and had several waitresses in attendance and we would NEVER treat customers like that especially if they were being as nice as we were.

We were in here twice within 10 days and both times did not have a good experience. The first evening our server was terrible. We had to ask her twice for our drinks, twice for ranch, twice for our check and three times for a to-go box. By the end she was no longer apologizing and said, ""Here"", then left. A good portion of her time was spent flirting with the table next to us. It took us over 2 hours, from the time we got our food, to get our check and leave. We called in a pizza for carry out the following week. All we wanted was a good pizza without the poor service. When we got home, the pizza was wrong and one of the best parts, the tomatoes, weren't even on the pizza and it was so dry. It was missing other toppings as well. Next time we know to check it before we leave. I've truly never had a pizza screwed up for delivery or carry out and didn't think to check it. We should've known. I gave 3 stars because of management. If something isn't right, they make sure it is before you leave (if dining in). It will probably be a long time before we come back, as we have a bad taste in our mouths after these last two incidents.

Our waitress then apologized and told us she FORGOT to put in our order!!! It took her a full 45 minuets to realize she had forgotten? Ridiculous. Then, she offered us a soup or salad ""on her"". Politely declining, just wanting our main course. 15 more minuets pass and now we have been waiting 1 hour for our dinner!!! It had FINALLY came out after an hour.  Dessert time. Thinking... ""Let's order early so this doesn't take forever"" we ordered two pazookies, 1 regular sized pazookie, which we had asked our waitress about because it was said to be ""free pazookie day"" (with a purchase of a meal) and 1 mini pazookie. Right after we had ordered dessert our waitress gave us the check. On the check was our two entrees and 2 full price pazookies. WRONG. So I flagged down the waitress and readdressed the free pazookie deal. Took 10 minuets to get the correct bill and 20 total minuets to receive our dessert.

My husband, 2.5 year old daughter & I were sat in the back room, straight through the bar.. Where they usually sit us.. We were sat at a table when there were 2 booths open. Ok.  Every table seemed to have a different server, so we waited patiently.  After both booths were filled, we started getting annoyed that nobody had even greeted JUST OUR TABLE; Making eye contact with each of the other tables servers. After the second booth was sat, a waitress came out took their drink order and went to go get them...  We left. And because my husband is on their rewards program (SUPER FREQUENT CUSTOMERS) the manager was able to call him and offer us to come back... No thanks.  Two weeks ago.. Evelyn was our waitress. (Pretty sure it has an 'i' in it.. Autocorrect)  After my husband ordering a small cheese pizza, and broccoli cheddar bread bowl... I over heard the table of girls behind me complain about how their server got their orders wrong.. Didn't think much of it. Our waitress comes by and gives us our second round of sodas.. And tells us that the kitchen messed up and made him a mini cheese and mine would be out soon. My husband tells her to wait on them and bring them out together. To which she returns to our table with this mini cheese pizza and me, nothing.. She comes back 10 minutes later and asks if everything was ok. So I gesture to my empty table and say 'um no not really', her response is 'it's coming soon' . She returns a minute later and has a young gentleman tell me he will be taking over our table because she has to go home. I'm not kidding when I tell you red hot steam had to have come from my ears when the food runner set down A SECOND PIZZA on our table, because the manager came over.  TWO PIZZAS BEFORE ONE SOUP?!  What is wrong with this picture?!  All the manager has to say is the generic 'sorry'..'it's on the house'  What is?! HIS dinner? Yea thanks!  Meanwhile the manager asks if I want to take the soup home with me.. Um no thanks. I wanted to eat dinner with my family.  Next thing I know our waitress is asking her next table what they want to drink.  Ps. The pizza that night was bogus. BOTH of them! Nothing but bread. Hardly any sauce and even less cheese.

Forget about it. - MEAT LOVER'S PIADINA: Don't bother, this is a fancy Hot Pocket that tastes only a little better. - BAT GRILLED CHEESE: Somehow they messed up on the ""grilled"" part, because the cheese was still unmelted.  - We ordered different fries and they arrived on the wrong plates. - Root of Evil Ginger IPA was pretty bad PROS: - We went when they were offering BOGO entrees so at least we didn't have to pay full price for their crappy lunch specials. Ended up paying about how much they were each worth anyway.  - Nice building I don't typically feel so strongly about BJ's, but this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth. ... ...

When we first arrived I informed him that we would want separate checks, which I knew to tell him in the beginning because I am a server at a chain restaurant as well. He acted annoyed and like it was going to be too complicated- we ended up only ordering 3 things and 5 waters... then when the food came he came back and asked if everything was tasting okay before we got to try it- still acceptable. But then after about 1 more minute he came back and asked to start a desert, so I awkwardly told him maybe later (knowing that my coworker told him it was my birthday). At the end of the meal he tried to give us our checks and to have a nice day so I mentioned to him ""didn't they tell you it was my birthday?"" he said ""oh yea, okay"" and started walking away- and then I asked him ""well don't I get to pick a pizookie?"" and he reluctantly started to list a few for me.

Once we ordered our food it took about 40 mins to come out.  My uncle ordered a medium rare steak and it came out completely well done.  Such a disappointment.  The only thing that was on point was the pazookie that night.

The drinks used to be $6 for a mojito, now its only $1 off, which brought the price to $7.50, quite expensive.

277,Nick D.,"Buena Park, CA",0,7,1.0,1.0,2016-10-14,"Very disappointed with this business as a whole, if I could give less than 1 star, they definitely deserve less.. So Friday night, my GF wants to go to BJ's to meet with her old work crew, I go reluctantly, as we've had poor service here before. After waiting for over an hour to be seated, we get taken to our table. Waiter asks what we'd like to drink, I order a Moscow Mule, at which point he informs me that he would have to talk to the bartender to see if they have an open ginger beer, and if they do not, then I would have to ""pay for the whole ginger beer($7.95), on top of the price of the mixed drink($10/12) that includes ginger beer!!!!!! That would be a $20 Moscow Mule!!!!!  The manager comes up and said he was told someone had a question... I never asked to speak to him, but thinking he would be a reasonable fellow and want to provide excellent customer service, he adamantly stated this was their policy. So I asked, so if I'm lucky enough to that someone else is ordering this same drink at the same time, I can have one for the normal price? But when would that be? So basically you cannot order a Mule with out paying for the whole ginger beer, so you pay for two drinks to get one. Unbelievable!!! I said I'll just save my money and ordered water. I did not order food, I will never go here or to another BJ's again. These people are trippin.

We go check to see if they wrote our name down to be seated and they say ""Oh yeah, we are just getting your table ready."" Okay? That doesn't make sense, but sure. A few minutes pass and they call us to be seated and walk us to our table. When we get there, there's literally like 4-5 tables empty next to our table... Whatever. Finally we get seated and the server takes our order. The server was actually very friendly and attentive. No complaints there. The food was, however, dissapointing yet again. Pasta was drowning in pasta sauce that the four shrimp that were in there almost floated. Thet chicken was plain and had no flavor. I imagine that is how eating cardboard must feel like. In conclusion, make sure they take your name down when you check in. They're just hanging out in the front so it's easy for them to miss your name while they gossip.

The cooks obviously don't know what the difference between searing and cooking means. The server had offered to replace my inedible platter, which was nice - but the chicken wings I got after that was pretty much just as bad. The chicken wings took forever to come out as well.

When it did finally come out, chips were all broken crumbs like those you'd find at the bottom of a bag of chips. The pizza was mediocre and wasn't even hot. Quality was lacking.

Anyways, skip to the point, he seemed to not want to serve us anymore so he had a different waitress take care of our table from that point on. He didn't even have the decency to notify us of this change. Rude, to say the least. Our new waitress was Ashley and she was wonderful. She had amazing service. However, Jordan did not smile at all when he took our orders. He definitely has a low patience tolerance. He walked past our table multiple times and did not say a single word after that.

You can tell they are constantly scanning and working to make sure guests are seated as soon as possible. I dine at this BJs frequently because of the service! I love the food, especially the Barbecue Chicken pizza, tomato mozzarella salad, chicken alfredo fettuccine, and strawberry lemonade (my usuals). Always end with either a cookies and cream/Oreo or chocolate chunk pizookie! You won't regret it. But why I consistently come back is the amazing and friendly service I always receive. My usual server is Mandukhai, who has such an effortless way about her that makes my dining experience feel comfortable. Mandukhai makes sure all my requests are met with efficiency and certainty. She always goes above and beyond in her service. I can also say the same for Connie and Cory! If you ever get Connie, you will get hit with so much fun and friendliness, it's infectious! Cory gives the best service, as well. He is so quick with every request and so freaking funny! Love this BJs because it's a big corporate restaurant that gives a small restaurant experience with its service.

The why;  2 star: BJ's is a chain, so the interior is much like all the other BJ's you've encountered unless it's your first time. Very clean, trendy, and commercial feel, it's definitely family friendly and group friendly, depending on your circumstances. The ambiance is very laid back with TV's all around if you're catching the game.  Is it intimate? Depends how close you want to breathe In your date's ear.  1 star: Our server, Jordan, did a good job. He was very informative and recommended a few things that we ended up purchasing. I was trying different beers and he brought me a Sample of a seasonal pilsner which I thought was cool. Attentive enough without over doing it.  1 star: The food is nothing spectacular. But it does get the job done. We ordered the chicken wings with the sauce on the side. Guacamole dip and chips, and the new nacho flatbread pizza. I can't really complain but there was nothing wow about it. But when I'm drinking a beer, anything taste good.  Why not a 5 star review? Because that would mean I stand behind the product.

We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and an appetizer. We waited 30 minutes, being ignored, before we could finally put our food order in. We didn't even get an apology for waiting so long from the man that took our food order. Then my boyfriend's food (with cold mashed potatoes) came out along with the appetizer and my entree didn't come out for another 15 minutes after. Again, no apology. No two bite check, we were completely ignored until our card was out to pay. We'd like to think we are regular customers who treat those in the service industry with generous tips for how hard they work. Last night, I didn't see any hustle. I understand restaurants get busy but bjs is large for a reason and supposed to handle that type of capacity.

The beers and fries were great, but our experience was rough.  My husband and I are vegetarian, so we ordered a pizza with black olives and artichokes. The server entered it as a ""BBQ chicken pizza with olives and artichokes"". I bit into chicken and spit it out. No biggie though, mistakes happen. We point this out and he puts in a rush order to get us the correct pizza. After bringing it out I take a big bite into my slice, only to have a mouth full of anchovies. In his rush, he entered an ""olive and anchovies"" pizza rather than artichokes. Apparently, he hit the wrong button on his iPad as toppings are listed alphabetically.  This is now the 2nd time that meat has been in my mouth tonight and made me nauseous. When they finally bring the 3rd pizza out it is completely correct. But by this time we've lost our appetites.

When my family and I got our food, my brother had to wait longer for his chicken alfredo because the staff accidentally dropped it and had to cook another one.     Considering that I have worked in restaurant service before, I simply brushed it off because I understood that that stuff happens sometimes. For the record, I want to say that the food tonight was delicious as always. BJs never fails to amaze me with their dishes. However, what got me upset was that when our server finally brought my brother's food, he was left to eat on his own since the rest of us were just about done. Additionally, when my brother's food arrived, our server did not even bother asking us if we wanted drink refills when most of our glasses were clearly empty. That was the last time we saw our server. We never got our refills and waited a while for our bill.   Thanks to Daniel for being such a great manager and remedying the situation. After expressing my frustration, he personally came over to our table with our bill and apologized for the mishap and service. He told us that he took my brother's chicken alfredo off the bill, and put in another 15% discount to reduce our total. At this moment, I felt valued as a customer and perceived this action on his end as excellent customer service. I expressed my gratitude and told him that I will for sure be coming back soon!

I've been to several and this particular location several times, but really never have had a great experience with any one.  Their menu is fairly extensive, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Their food, I would describe, as average at best. The consistency is also very poor. At a different location in Nevada, I ordered the same dish several different times. Each time, it was different. Once, the pasta dish, which is supposed to be hot, came out stone cold.  A friend of mine once found glass in his pasta dish at a different BJ's location. But I'll talk about this location.  It's your standard BJ's layout, but it's busy. During peak times, expect to wait 30+ minutes for a table for two.  Our most recent time here, as soon as we sat down and unrolled our utensils, we found both sets to be dirty. Not just a little dirty, but with large pieces of baked-on food. Both mine and my girlfriend's were soiled. We asked for replacement sets and those were also soiled just the same. Disgusting!  We specifically ordered food that didn't need utensils to eat.  The female server, Kayla, repeatedly called me ""hun"" with my girlfriend sitting right across from me. I find that rude and unprofessional.  In the bathrooms, there was no toilet paper or seat covers in the female restrooms.  The beer? I wouldn't bother. If you appreciate good beer, order something from their craft brew menu, not their in-house selections.

7,Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081.0,3.0,2017-07-12,"Came here last night for their Tuesday half off wine special, which is a great deal! Parking here isn't too difficult after 8pm. There's plenty of seating inside, but my friends and I chose bar seating instead of restaurant seating. They had a 3 for $12 Trio which is a preview of their new and healthier items. We thought we might give it a try. Here's what we ordered: Garlic Knots - These were okay, I personally think I make better garlic knots. It was incredibly dry and lacked any amount of garlic. Eat them while they're still hot, otherwise you're stuck with cardboard. Mac & Cheese Couscous - This was the only decent thing out of the entire trio. The texture of the couscous blended well with the cheese. I definitely enjoyed this dish, I also liked that it was extra baked, so the cheese on top was nice and crispy. Sautéed Spinach & Kale - This was tasteless. It was just onions; some tomatoes, spinach and kale tossed into a little bowl and heated up. There was no taste to it; definitely the worst thing we ordered. **Final verdict for the 3 for $12 trio: I wouldn't try the trio again; I think I would much prefer their actual appetizers over this.** French Fries - This came from their normal appetizers. The fries are no longer thin and seasoned. Now they're just steak cut, salted, and deep fried. You need to eat this with ketchup; otherwise it won't taste like anything. Mashed Potatoes - We ordered this to share. My friend was craving mashed potatoes, and this wasn't so bad. I probably wouldn't eat it alone, but would prefer it as a side with my entrée. Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza -  1/2 off during HH after 10pm. This was pretty good. It came out piping hot, and I liked how the pepperoni was cut into thin strips so it was extra crispy. The pizza was definitely tiny; you can eat an entire one alone if you didn't eat anything else. I would probably get this again during their HH next time because I really enjoyed it. Estancia Cabernet Sauvignon - Generally sold for about $36 a bottle at BJ's, we were able to get it for $18 for their  1/2 off Tuesday deal. Not bad, it was enough for 3 of us to share. I would recommend this Cabernet, it smells amazing and doesn't taste overly bitter like other Cabernets I've had. Overall experience here wasn't the best. The service was extremely slow; we had to flag down our server several times to get him to bring extra condiments or utensils. However, he was very accommodating despite the slow service. The food took about 20 minutes to get to us, so I recommend ordering right when you get the chance.

Then we get our pizza, finish, and get the bill, and the appetizer is on the bill, so we felt cheated. We paid the bill, but left no tip because of it and left with a sour taste in our mouths.

Love BJs happy hour, appetizers & beer till midnight ? Why not ! I had came back yesterday and it was extremely packed on a Wednesday night. My friends and I were seated right behind the host since there were no more seats where the happy hour section is. I then asked our waitress if they would still honor happy hour since I came with a party of 8 and they did honor it. We got started with the avocado roll and calamari & I had put in my order for beer . I then decided I was really craving for pasta so I had ordered a grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo pasta.  For a party of 8 our food appeared quickly I was very surprised & so glad since I was starting to get hangry haha . I wished the pasta was more cheesier but not gonna lie it was pretty decent and I sure did devour it . My friends had then order desserts so we ended our night with pizzooki! BJs recently started this churro pizzooki which I was really looking forward to but was a bit disappointed because the churro didn't taste good. The churro yesterday night was missing the cinnamon and sugar it was also too soft for a churro, hopefully they fix that can't wait to try it again !

So we are waiting and waiting and it's been about 30 mins and were wondering what the hell is going on. So finally, my boyfriend gets up and goes to see what is taking so long. You guys, the hostess FORGOT to put our name in. So then they tell us it's going to be another 5 mins. Back to waiting. They finally call our name and try to seat us at some tiny ass table against the wall with 50 million kids around. Like a chuckie cheese section of Bjs. Wtf, ummm no. So we finally see a table open by the bar and we take it.  So far, things are good. Our waitress is super nice. We ordered our food: half Mediterranean and half bjs favorite pizza and some chicken wings. Then we get our pizza, and it literally looks like the cooks threw a bunch of shit on there. I said half and half you guys and I got a mixture of every ingredient known to mankind. So I notify the waitress. She was really sweet and agreed it looked like vomit and took it back to the kitchen. Eventually, we got a new pizza made properly, the right way. The only thing good about this night was the waitress. It's too bad I didn't get her name to compliment her service in this review.

9,Tracey N.,"Arcadia, CA",313,103,184.0,3.0,2017-11-25,"Every time I come here, we usually get a table within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of parking spaces around the restaurant. The service here is quick and friendly.  It's pretty big with indoor and outdoor sittings. The bar area has many big-screen TVs and they usually have sport games on.  However, the food quality here is just mediocre.  Definitely not worth the price they are charging.  They need to put a lot more work into the plate presentation.  This time, I ordered the rib-eye steak with the house salad and mashed potatoes.  The plate came out with a big piece of steak and a scoop of mashed potatoes next to it.  It looked pretty plain! I wish I can say it tastes better than it looks but naa, not really...My friend ordered the fresh Atlantic salmon.  The plate looks yummy but the salmon is greasy with oil. I had the chicken alfredo to-go as well and wasn't so impressed with that either.   It's a nice restaurant but I wish they would improve their food quality because the dishes are so bland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach,3.16,3.07,2.964,,3.106

58,Zsanelle L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,17,9.0,1.0,2017-11-28,"I'm so sad to have to give a negative review because I love the pizza here and I bring my nephew often! On Sunday night 11/26/17 at 12:45 Our server Michael made my experience very unpleasant. I could tell from the get go that he seemed to be irritated by our party of four. After he repeated back our order I asked for our pizza well done and he was visibly frustrated. I apologized for the inconvenience. I know how it can be; I'm a server too! He brought our pizza and it was not well done. He was slow at refilling drinks but no bother, I know how busy it can be. Towards the end of our meal I presented Michael a coupon for ten dollars off 35. In the past when I've done this I receive a reduced second check. I waited but didn't receive one so our party sorted out what our payments would be. When I waved Michael down I let him know how we would be paying having divided cash and card and placing them inside the envelope. I began to explain to him when he cut me off and said ""so I'll go out of my way and bring you separate checks."" He returned and said ""the coupon applied to this check since I split it."" It wasn't even my half of the check! So I politely tried to explain that I didn't want the check split but that I was trying to show which tender goes where. I said ""I'm sorry I'm not trying to be difficult"" the response I received ""well, it is difficult."" Never before have I received such terribly rude service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=40,3.12,3.04,2.96,,3.0720000000000005

I ordered large pazooki for my sister's birthday to be picked up.  The order was done on time and the box was warm. When we tried to cut the pazooki and the pazooki was stuck to the foil under it. My friend who works in a restaurant said that she thinks that they forgot to take the foil out and just put it in the box. It was a little embarrassing because we invited friends over the cookie was a bit of a disaster. We had to flip the cookie over so we could tear the foil off of it. Pazookis are GREAT when you eat in the restaurant.

I requested they lower it a bit but they didn't. I asked for the manager since I come here all the time and know from experience it was really loud. He came out smirking and said he lowered it in two adjacent rooms but not the one we were in. A true smart (bleep). When he left for the back room the sound was lowered to normal in two seconds. So it could have been done easily before.   I love background music but for some reason this morning the guys working the place wanted it to pound you senseless. Besides this morning manager being a (bleep) I really enjoy the good food and waitresses I know over the years.

Mind you, we had family driving all the way from Corona and Oceanside, we could've gone to another BJ's on the way, but was really hoping to have our family gathering in that patio area.
