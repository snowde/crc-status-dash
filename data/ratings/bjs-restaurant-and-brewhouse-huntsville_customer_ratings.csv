110,Kendra S.,"Monterey, CA",61,31,45.0,4.0,2015-07-09,"I just moved from CA and was excited to see BJ's opening because this is one of my fav places to go for games and with groups. You will be able to see a TV from any seat in the house.  They are known for their pizzas and burgers, but make sure you leave room for the pizookie at the end! You won't regret it! The music is loud and so is the conversation. The place just opened, so it's popular. The menu is diverse and has a lot of great offerings from appetizers to small bites to entrees, including gluten free options. Picky eaters will find something to please their palate. They have great lunch deals and prices, as well.  They offer a variety of beers and wines. Download their app and start collecting rewards. Use it to pay, use it to request a seat, use it to order your food ahead of time.  They are newly opened and so far so good! They have things running smoothly! Thank you, BJ's for branching out of Cali and coming to my neck of the woods!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville?start=100,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001
80,Zack M.,"Madison, AL",83,36,111.0,4.0,2015-07-11,"Being a huge fan of beer and pizza I had to check out Bjs Brewhouse. My first experience was impressive even though it was opening night. I got lucky and was aimed towards a table for 2 on the East side of the bar near the window, which was perfect cause I was meeting my Dad for some beer. My server Chelsea recommended The Oasis Amber homebrew, so I did. The beer was perfect compared to the one I chose afterward (TheJeremiahRed). After first glimpse of the menu, my eyes were stuck on Carnitas Fries. Overall a good first impression. Looking forward to trying some more items on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville?start=80,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408

The atmosphere is great and I love that they close at 1am on weekends compared to everything thing else in Hsv. Had the Mahi-Mahi, very awesome and my gf had the Jumbalaya which was just as awesome. We had wings for appetizer which was delicious and my In house brew beer was very flavorful. Even the Pizookie's were delightful. We waited a long time for our food which was the only drawback but for the prices and how they tasted, it was well worth the wait. No big deal there but then again I'm not too picky when it comes to that type of stuff. Our server was very attentive but didn't bombard us with soda or water like at a Applebee's.

I was a little nervous after reading reviews that service would be bad, but I was pleased with our server. She was good about refilling our drinks and, while busy, never rushed us as we asked her questions.  We started with the avocado egg rolls. These were rather spicy and the main reason I didn't give the restaurant a five star review.  We had a deep dish pizza next and it was good. Surprisingly large for the mini.  Our dessert was the best part of the meal and I would definitely suggest saving room. Portions are large on all dishes and we were left with four extra egg rolls and two pieces of pizza (and we ordered the mini pizza to split).  All in all - a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville?start=60,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007
75,Pamela M.,"Huntsville, AL",90,299,683.0,4.0,2015-07-29,"Monthly Girl's Night Out convened @ BJ R&B post work. I think our fearless leader reserved a table. She arrived at 4:45ish to claim the table & the restaurant was not busy. It didn't take long for it to really fill up! Here's the skinny: Large, warehouse styled interior, maybe 20 ft ceilings? Covered patio. Large bar. Open styled kitchen in back separated from dining room by Plexiglass. Relentless fruit flies, & a lot of them. Fairly noisy. Menus will preclude your gym curl routine coz they weigh a ton. Staff, friendly, but semi-stressed, maybe she was overseated. Various runners bring your dishes. I think they are still running on their out of town crew aka ""store openers"" staff to get the joint ""off on the right foot."" So, expect smaller portions & less slick service & smiling faces in the upcoming weeks. Many of our ?s could have been alleviated if they had enough table tents listing the HH specials. In between trying to *hear* our server & then process what she said, before she would add, ""I need to grab desserts for them, I'll be right back"" during which time, we would get half of the specials, but not the whole picture. Even adding a page to the voluminous menu including the HH specials would have helped.  Anyhoo, on to the eats & whatnot. It was ""wine down"" Tuesday, so all bottles were half price & all glasses were half price all night long, so a nice pinot grigio was ~ 3.95. Other specials were $1 off certain beers. That's about all I could catch on the HH drink specials. Small plates were 1/2 price on some, & the mini pan pizza was $5.00. The HH prices were completely on point. The wine list was solid & beer lovers will not be disappointed. However, after one beer, my friend was told they had sold out of the beer she was drinking. She found a suitable substitute.  Our 4-some shared the following:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip (described as ""A rich & creamy blend of spinach, artichokes, cream cheese & spices, topped with Parmesan cheese. Served warm with crisp corn tortilla chips."" )- the artichokes were fresh tasting & abundant, otherwise, this was just like you get anywhere else.  Chicken Pot Stickers (described as ""Filled with chicken, onions, Chinese chives, ginger & garlic. Served with soy ginger sauce & topped with green onions & sesame seeds."" ) - again, st&ard fare pot stickers, a la PF Changs or any Asian place. Santa Fe Spring Rolls (described as ""Filled with chicken, black beans, red bell peppers, cilantro, sweet corn, jalapeños & jack cheese. Topped with pico de gallo & served with Santa Fe dressing & avocado cream sauce."")  - these were good, tightly rolled fried spring rolls, & even though they forgot the pico de gallo & we didn't ask for any, the other sauces were nice! I was afraid these would be the same ones served at Bison's & other sports bars, but they were unique & flavorful. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts (described as ""Lightly fried brussels sprouts tossed in Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold seasoning with sweet sriracha crema."")  - we DEVOURED these sprouts! They were as good as Cork & Crust's on (even tho C&C dresses theirs w/ truffle oil). Personally, I would have enjoyed more heat from the sriracha, or a bottle of S. on the table. Still, a clear ""home run."" Crispy Fried Artichokes (described as ""Lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp & sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Served w/ lemon garlic aioli."" )-These were like Fried artichoke balls. They were good, but sort of a waste of a beautiful artichoke heart, IMHO. The rest of the group *loved* this dish. A squeeze of fresh lemon made the app pop, & I'm not sure we received the ""lemon garlic aioli."" So, you can do like me & pop the heart out, squeeze the lemon & savor the freshness. Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza (~8 inches)(described as ""Fresh & delicious! Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese & sliced peperoncinis.) -As a non-pizza lover, & being really encouraged to ""try it"" - I did, & just scraped all the toppings off the crust, so I can't comment on the crust. The pizza made four high school cafeteria sized pieces & really did have good, fresh toppings with a lot of flavor.  A good value at $5 if your are into pizza. Order this before their HH ends at 6 All in all a good time, especially since we always have stuff to chat about. The fruit flies were a total annoyance, & borderline yucky, since we were in a booth at the back in front of the kitchen's plexiglass window, where the fruit flies converged, clinging to the plexiglass, & were joined by other flies just hanging around....come to think of it, I believe their is a garage door connecting the elevated bar area to the covered patio, because a thunderstorm rolled through & I recall the staff scrambling around to close the door - so voila! That's how the flies got in.  Go to BJ R&B, they offer lighter/healthier options, too, so it's not all fried food & pizza.

138,Elizabeth B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,77,11.0,2.0,2015-09-17,"Thank you BJ's for reminding me why I usually avoid big chain restaurants. They told us it would be a 10 minute wait and we ended up waiting over half an hour. We ordered immediately because we had time to look over the menu about 18.5 times and memorize it backwards and forwards... and it took another 40 minutes to get our food. Now, I am pretty forgiving when it comes to slow service. If the food is good I won't even mention it. After waiting that long I could have eaten an old boot. It was definitely better than that, but even in our hungry state we were less than impressed. My sister and I shared the Thai Mango Salad, which included no mango (or Thai seasoning). If there was dressing on there, I couldn't tell. I got through the whole salad before I found one single mango matchstick stuck to the bottom of the plate. 11 dollars is a lot to spend on lettuce and bland chicken. The French Dip was actually really good, but the fries that came with it were stone cold. My other sister ordered fish tacos and reported that they were flavorless and had to ask the waitress for extra salsa. I have no problem with a restaurant having an extensive menu if they do everything on it well, but most don't. I guess when you go to a place like this you should really stick to burgers and pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville?start=120,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006
108,Samantha W.,"Madison, AL",0,11,,5.0,2015-09-25,"My husband and I decided to try BJ's for our anniversary dinner. We had purchased tickets for an 8:15pm movie, but were running behind and didn't get to BJ's until 6:50pm. We didn't have a reservation so the hostess said it would be about a 10 - 15 minute wait, which would leave us with under an hour to eat. We decided to take the chance and I'm glad we did. The hostess got us seated in about 5 minutes and our waitress was there almost immediately. We let her know that we had movie tickets and she was able to get our appetizers and drinks to the table promptly and our food arrived around 7:20pm. This gave us plenty of time to eat and even some time to relax before heading to our movie. The waitress came by regularly to check on us. Now, about the food, it was great! Our drinks were great, my husband got the Long Island Ice Tea and said it had all the right components and wasn't too strong or too weak. I had the Strawberry Splash and it was sweet, strawberry flavored, and cool and refreshing. We shared some mozzarella sticks. They were not the best, probably frozen, but I still really enjoyed them. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and said it was delicious. The fries were the skinnier, homemade version--good flavor and crisp. The burger was huge, which we were both kind of surprised about. My husband liked it quite a bit. I had comfort food, the Southern Fried Chicken. The chicken was yummy and their mashed potatoes are better than my moms and my mom is a great cook. The corn was also very tasty and paired wonderfully with the chicken and mashed potatoes.

67,Douglas P.,"Wilmington, NC",1,1,,2.0,2015-10-01,"I've never written a bad review before today, but as much as my wife and I wanted to enjoy this place, the service and food were sub-par and after our stomachs settled down, I figured I needed to share our experience.  We walked in today mid-afternoon and had no problem getting a table in the bar area. The restaurant was 90% empty. Our server took our order: two beers, queso dip, and two crispy jalapeño burgers. The beer came quickly and it was wonderful. Everything went down hill after that. We sat waiting for our appetizer for 20-25 minutes. I was wondering if this was a technique to sell a second round of beer; make people wait so long for food they drink the beer waiting and then order more when the food comes. We only got our appetizer after I waved our server over and she remarked ""Oh, you still don't have your queso"". So she went and got our queso. We ran out of chips, and she said she'd bring more...she never did. Our burgers arrived 15-20 minutes after the queso. Total wait was about 40 minutes after ordering. Our server told us the kitchen didn't cook them medium, so she had them redo them. I was excited about the burger, but my first bite was a major disappointment. Very little flavor in an $11+ burger. In fact, a Hardees Thickburger put it to shame! My wife felt the same about her burger. Within 20 minutes of eating the burgers, we both had upset stomachs and were a little angry that we just spent $41 for food that was unremarkable and service that was far from good.

The food was phenomenal and was delivered very promptly. We ordered the Spicy Hawaiian pizza. It was probably the best pizza I've ever eaten.  Only complaint was the service. The young lady that was serving us had the personality of a bag of rocks. She was better at the beginning of the meal than toward the end.  I ordered a beer when we first sat down and it was delivered promptly. Once I finished it, just before our food arrived, she asked if I wanted another. I declined and asked for a water. That's when her demeanor went down hill. She gave me a terrible look, said ""Oh you just want a water?"", and walked away. Several minutes later when she came back by, I asked again for a water. She said she would be right back. Moments later, she came back with a pitcher and refilled my wife's water, still no water for me.  We finished meal and asked for check. She acted disgusted and flipped our check down in front of our infant child. We paid and left.  Basically I ate my entire meal sipping on my wife's water because she refused to bring me one.

BJ's Brewhouse is an unexpected surprise among the many, many chains that often park to grab up new retail space in Huntsville.  After trying (and failing) nearby Bravo!, I wasn't expecting much other than a beer burger joint that oddly hit me in that Gordon Biersch kinda way.  But low expectations and a healthy appetite are where second children and surprisingly good dining experiences come from, it seems.  I won't talk about how I know the former...so we'll focus on the latter.  If 'Suburban Industrial' is a style, the interior of BJ's would be just that.  High walls adorned with ongoing of murals of what could be best described as Atlas Shrugged figures doing stuff with grains.  Again, reminiscent of many many generic brew houses and art Deco Nebraska.  The dark red/black motif makes me think of all the cattle I've eaten over the years.  There's an array of flat screens and a few more strategically placed to give just about everyone in the dining area a view of the latest games.  Also hard to miss is the bar area... But I haven't tested their top shelf material or their barkeeps' expertise just yet.  Again, keeping the bar low.  Now onto the food...  What I've had... Bacon guac burger, calamari, Southwest egg rolls, pot stickers, ahi tuna, Brussel spouts with Sriracha and a four meat deep dish pizza.   Of those, they're all pretty to very good with the exception of the Southwest rolls.  Honestly there's absolutely nothing to em.  But standouts are the burgers, the Brussel sprouts and the deep dish.  Granted, the deep dish isn't Malnatti's... but approaches Gino's.  Oddly, the Cheesecake Factory-esque menus don't contain a single onion ring option.  I mean... seriously? Am interesting thing here is the mix and match beer brews.  You can mix a low ABV fruity type with a heavier stout on your own or pick one from their list of go-to orders.  Or... You can try 'em straight, from names you know to a few local IPAs you might not. There are also cocktails, wine and the likes as well. The waitstaff is hit or miss on both personality and responsiveness.  First time around, the service really popped albeit nervously.  The second time around, our server was MIA and we suffered some mix ups in the orders.  But none of it seemed grossly negligent so not a death knell in my book.   I'm gonna even venture to say that BJ's is a good time spot at Bridgestreet for the family, date night or even the bar flies like myself.  I think the fact that it's new actually helps attract a fairly diverse crowd by Huntsville terms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville?start=40,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.056,3.7200000000000006

Our drinks were only refilled once (and that took FOREVER), we didn't receive silverware until 10 min after our food had arrived, and didn't receive our check until 15 min after I requested it. We felt like an inconvenience to the waiter. It was awful. Our second trip was this past Friday for lunch. We showed up around 11:30 and were seated at a two-person high-top table in the bar area. These tables had zero privacy...the tables to the right and left were literally two feet away on each side. So we asked the hostess if we could sit at a booth instead (mind you there were 5 open booths that we counted at that time), and she said that we couldn't because there were no servers for those booths. Well not 5-10 min later, EVERY one of those booths were filled. Unbelievable. To be a paying customer and be lied to was very unsettling.

It was basically a thick crust pizza with hardly any cheese or sauce (and I asked for extra sauce) that was baked in a deep dish pan. Little Caesars' $10 thick crust pizza has more flavor. The Pizookie is THE BOMB! I would go back just for the dessert. We tried the triple sampler and liked all three picks (monkey bread, chocolate chip cookie and Double Chocolate.) Service was terrible.

5,Charnetta M.,"Huntsville, AL",190,179,1332.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"Joined my colleagues here for our Christmas lunch today. It was a full house but there didn't appear to be a wait. Service was a bit slow (on the kitchen's end) and it took about 30+ minutes for our food to come out. However, our server was nice and she kept the refills coming. I ordered the combo appetizer which cost approx $18. What I was served was not worthy of my $18 before the tip. The boneless buffalo chicken pieces was very salty. I requested for the buffalo sauce to come on the side and after tasting an overabundance of salt, just on the chicken, I opted out on using the sauce. I didn't want to add on any additional sodium.  The spinach and artichoke dip was ok.  Cheesesticks were cold and the cheese was stale & limp.  The avocado egg rolls was ok.  If I had to sum this meal up, I'd say the quality of this platter reminded me of the appetizers you buy in the frozen foods section of the grocery store. The chips that came with the spinach dip was the best tasting thing on my plate.  Overpriced for the quality. Subpar menu selection.

The atmosphere at BJ's is very inviting and attractive.  I enjoyed that. I also really liked our waiter.  I did not catch his name, but he was a taller black man wearing glasses.  He had a nice smile and pleasant demeanor.  He brought us our silverware (the hostess forgot), made sure to ask us the order in which we wanted our food to be brought out, and was prompt about refilling our beverages. The menu was...confusing?  Appetizers, then like 3 pages worth of alcoholic beverages, then soups and salads, then pizza, then entrees, then lunch specials.  It's massive and a little overwhelming and not set up very well, in my opinion.  It's also a shame that many of the lunch offerings aren't available at dinner; I saw many dishes I would have rather had but were only served during lunch hours.  The lunch specials look like a good deal; dinner prices were a little high (in my opinion...perhaps not, though, as it is a kind of upscale location).   My boyfriend liked the beer he drank.  The food was only so-so, however.  We started with mozzarella sticks and sriracha queso and chips.  The mozzarella sticks themselves were tasty, if a little lightly breaded, but the marinara sauce was oddly sweet and not super appetizing.  The queso had good flavor but was a little congealed (had to mix it up in order to reach a desired consistency).  The chips themselves were too small.  We split the chicken and broccoli fettuccine.  It tasted good, but would have been much better if it had come out hotter -- as served, it was lukewarm.  Our waiter brought us two garlic knots instead of one, since we were sharing.  A nice touch, and the bread was obviously fresh and piping hot.  Best part of the main meal.   The Pizookie was outstanding, though.  There's almost nothing better than a fresh baked cookie with ice cream.  I'm not sure I'll be back to try another main course, but I'm definitely coming for another Pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville,3.12,3.17,3.17,2.476,3.15

I found a table next to the server station and sat down. It took over 5 minutes for a server to greet me, provide a menu, and take my drink order even though the servers were visiting the server station just inches away from my table.  Once served the service was good and courteous. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip with Swiss cheese lunch special. While waiting for my order to arrive I enjoyed the big screen TVs in the bar area. The back wall contains the list of beers that they have on tap and I wish I could partake, but I had to return to work. I noticed an advertisement on the table for a new seasonable beer called Mad Crazy Mango IPA, again I wish I could try it.   My food arrived and it looked appealing even though the two sandwich sections appeared to be small. The Prime Rib was cooked medium rare and was very salty. The fries were average and the horseradish dip was good and I don't care for horseradish dip. Normally I don't mention the quality of the ice tea, but they have very good ice tea. It's not to light and not too dark. The price of my lunch special was high.  $20.93, before tip, is too high for a small Prime Rib Dip sandwich and an ice tea. The restaurant is very large and loud.

18,Clariee J.,"Chattanooga, TN",40,101,309.0,3.0,2017-06-08,"I've visited BJs several times and I've enjoyed both visits. I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy, but I haven't had anything that was excellent, either. It seems like the type of place that has such an expansive menu, excellence is a little out of reach.  I love the idea of a small plates menu. They have several options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The roasted garlic, spinach and kale is good; my mom loved the cauliflower plate and the beets. She loves veggies and is a little particular, so I trust her palate. The selection is great but again, a large selection typically is lacking in excellence. The wings are nice and plump, but aren't really seasoned. It seems like they cook them then toss them in sauce (the root beer glare is good, btw) or sprinkle them with lemon/pepper. So a dry rub winds up more on the bottom of the plate than on the wing. The pizookie is good, but can be cooked a little too long. I shouldn't have to forcefully get the cookie away from the edges. I've had better at differently Bricks locations. The dinner salads are large, but if I order a BBQ chicken salad, I expect to find more than 6 small pieces of chicken in it. I asked the waitress about this (""How do they decide how much chicken to add?"" ""It's a whole chicken breast."" I call bullshit.)  The appetizers are good. The sampler appetizer is meant for at least 4 people, I'd say. The stuffed shrooms are good, but make sure there are 6 on your plate and not 5 (I'm guessing the waiter dropped one of mine on the way to the table? When I got the plate, there was a clear spot where a mushroom used to be.). Their homemade soft drinks are good. Root beer on tap is one of my friend's favorites. For me, the soda's don't have a lot of bite to them. I want it to feel like a scorpion stung the back of my throat after I've had 3 sips. Just my preference. I've never been disappointed, but I've learned to adjust my expectations accordingly. Good, yes. Visit again? Certainly. Excellent?

6,James S.,"Huntsville, AL",0,5,,2.0,2017-10-13,"We've been here several times and each time it is very busy.  Tonight, we did call ahead to check on wait times because we had 2 small children with us & needed to eat sooner than later.  She took my name but there was currently no wait ! We were walking from the H&M, so not far.  By the time we got there, a wait had started....we were told 15 minutes...40 minutes later we were seated. We would not have eaten there had we known the wait was the long with the children. I think everyone came at once, but overall service was slow, food was slow, dinner came out before our appetizer.  It was just a hot mess. We love their food, but for future reference, we'll tack on double the wait time they tell us because that has been consistent theme every time we come.   Isn't it better to over estimate than under?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville,2.72,2.96,2.96,,2.8640000000000003

The kitchen had some hiccups regarding the temperature of the steak. No fault of Alex. The steak came back out perfect and I know it was because the waiter made sure if it. Thanks for the service and good attitude. The bar staff (also took food orders for bar patrons) as a whole seemed on point.

15,Donna B.,"Rock Spring, GA",3,28,1.0,2.0,2017-12-10,"I would never eat at BJ's again. We were in town for my husband to run the marathon. We were actually looking for another restaurant but were unable to locate it. We finally decided on Bj's. To say the entrees were terrible is an understatement. My steak was brought to the table charred. You would think if you are supposed to be a steakhouse you would have great steak. My husband's was fair but not good. I also got asparagus and it was cooked beyond recognition. The only reason I am giving them two stars is the server. He was trying his best. Also the guacamole was good.  After the charred steak was delivered to our table the manager came by and apologized. He did not offer to credit the meal or compensate in anyway. This was not good customer service. It was very busy, for some reason, since the food is not very good I do not understand why.  All I can say is if you want good food do not go here. We spent $50 plus for horrible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville,2.96,2.97,2.97,,2.966

10,Chris G.,"Huntsville, AL",39,6,2.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"I don't think my wife and I will ever go here again. Which is a shame. The food is so good and at a decent price. The reason we likely won't be back is the abysmal service. We've gone back over and over again hoping they'd be better, only to get let down. To provide an example, I'll describe our last visit which has been typical for the majority of our trips there. We go in, and I used the app to let them know we were coming. We got seated pretty quickly because they weren't very busy. But once at our table, we didn't see our waiter for 15 minutes for her to ask us for our drink order. Once we finally got our drinks, it was another 15+ minutes before we were even able to flag down our waiter to place our order. This whole time, I'm using my phone to time how long it takes for us to get our food because that's the worst thing, to be hungry and wait forever to get your food. And to state again, they weren't that busy, if they had been, it would have been understandable. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. The food was delivered and the waiter walked away before we could mention that we never got silverware. So we had to wait five minutes to even touch our food because we didn't have anything to eat it with. We maybe got one refill on our drinks this whole time, which was well over an hour and a half. The table next to us looked to be in the same situation. They waited forever for their food, and their faces reflected the same feelings as mine. This place is friendly, and has great food, but for the love of God, don't go there hungry, you'll wait forever to get your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville,2.64,2.94,2.94,,2.8200000000000003
1,Autumn M.,"Harvest, AL",10,25,61.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"Sports bars, burger joints, and ""American"" food restaurants alike, please take note that portobello mushrooms make great burgers!  And the big kicker is, they provide a great option for non meat eaters and those trying to steer away from the processed bean or ""veggie"" patties that are much too often dry with a weird texture.   I had visited BJs on a couple of occasions before, with no plans on going back after subpar dining experiences and inconsistent customer service.   After being told by a vegetarian friend that she had recently had a very tasty portobello burger here, my husband decided to extend them a chance for redemption.  Because this was a pick-up order, this review is based on my husbands account when he went to pick up his food.   Sadly, BJs overall customer service experience is still lacking.  After a confusing wait at the pick-up counter, and having to send the burger back twice due to forgetting to exclude dairy ingredients, my husband says his experience was saved by an employee named Preach.  I guess 3rd time was a charm, because the burger my husband brought home was pretty darn good!  The portobello was grilled nicely, topped will grilled onions, tomato, and mixed green; all between a nice fluffy bun.   The burger was generously sized, and even after I had taken a couple bites my husband could not finish the whole thing.  A side of nicely done asparagus completed his meal. All in all, I commend BJs for providing this option of burger, great choice for vegetarian/vegans; we'll probably returning with strong hopes that it's done as well the next time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntsville,2.64,2.93,2.93,,2.814
