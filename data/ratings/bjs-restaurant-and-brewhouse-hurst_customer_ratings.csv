It is on the outskirts of the mall, but the food was pretty good and you couldn't ask for a bigger selection of beers, both their own and others.  As one of the other reviews noted, Brandi is incredibly nice and considerate as a bartender, asking if you want a sample of a beer if it isn't something you've had before, etc.  They also have a happy hour with bar discounts in the evening after the traditional happy hour. One thing that was good and bad was the music they played. It isn't a jukebox, but they went from some cool interesting tunes (Bjork, MIA, etc.) to mid 70s songs and then back again. Imagine if a teenager and a 60 year old were fighting/alternating songs and that is how it seemed.

It's all good though, satisfactory, and there's a HUGE selection to choose from. I'm always a little suspicious of menus like that (i.e. Cheesecake Factory), because how can ONE restaurant make great pasta, pizza, sandwiches, steak, seafood, salads, soups, chickens, desserts, etc.? I think it's just too much for one restaurant to handle every food genre ever with expertise. However, BJ's ambiance was cheery and cool, our hostess and waiter were all smiles, and I'd say my experience overall was - as that rating bar above says - ""A-OK.""  I'll go back and try something else, I think... there will forever be something else to try!

They have lots of beers but I totally heart their berry cider!  This time, I ordered 2 of the tasters as well and I tried the blends.  The blends were good but just plain berry was best.   In summary, BJ's is pretty inside so I like that.  I didn't get the burger I normally get.  I didn't like that.  The cider hasn't changed.  I like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=120,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7640000000000002,3.0800000000000005

The California club flatbread pizza and the Hawaiian Maui Maui are my two favorite dishes.

I've been to BJs many times at other locations and it is a little bit better than Meh chain. We started with the Thai wantons.

They have great specialty beers, I'm more of a fan of the Red and the Nutty Brewnette beers, but the whole selection is great. The atmosphere is all right, and on most nights you get some discounts due to happy hour. I would prefer the prices not be as expensive as they are, but they're okay as far as the food goes. The dessert, however, far too expensive. It's nine bucks for three scoops of ice cream and a square of chocolate. Every time I go, I have to make a decision whether I want only an appetizer, only an entree, or only a dessert, because you can't have two or all three options and have it below twenty bucks. Sadly.  However the fourth star comes from the servers, they always have been amazing and friendly, and always come to check on you.

My wife has to eat gluten free and is always looking for a good GF menu. She had a GF cheese pizza and said it was one of the best GF pizzas that she has had. I'm glad for her because it is difficult finding good tasting GF menus.   I had the grilled chicken club sandwich (hold the avocado please) with fries. The fries were rubbery and I only ate a few. I'm not real sure what was going on with them, but I've had better at fast food drive thrus. No kidding. My sandwich was drenched in mayo to the point I didn't taste much of anything but mayo. It literally dripped from the sandwich to the plate when I picked it up. Not good. The bacon was over-cooked and chewy and reminded me of the rubber fries. I didn't quite finish my sandwich either, and thought that I could get a better tasting sandwich, cheaper, somewhere else.    The service was decent and the staff was nice and friendly. I'm pretty big on customer service so if wait staff isn't friendly or attentive, I don't go back. I'm am thrilled my wife liked the GF pizza so it gives us an alternative to other places when we are in the area.

I usually play it safe and order a Caesar salad and a personal-sized pizza or a flatbread pizza.  The pizzas are good but nothing super special to write home about.  I also have gone several times when I am in ""diet mode"" and ordered their Chicken Tacos which is on their 575 cal light section.  The tacos are miniature and you get three of them.  Together they equal probably one taco.  They are really good!  You also get a little slaw and black beans.  The black beans are really bland but edible.   This past time I went I ordered a Bleu Cheese Bacon burger with shoestring fries. It was DISGUSTING!!  The burger was cooked decent but was topped with an ungodly amount of bleu cheese.  Now. I like bleu cheese and can appreciate a decent amount but there was probably about 1/2 cup of melted bleu cheese on this burger.  It was excessive and looked like barf!  The bacon was not crispy - as a matter of fact - it looked like it was still partially raw!  Geez!  I had to scrap some of the bleu cheese of and set it aside which grossed out my lunch partner since it looked so disgusting.  Thinking back I should have sent it back to the kitchen but I hate to be a complainer!  Anywho ... if you want a place that cooks EVERYTHING and specializes in NOTHING then this is a good choice.  Probably will go again because its our reqular lunch spot - or maybe I will suggest we venture out.

I had a pizza and it was better than delivery but nothing in comparison to the good sit down pizza places or a good hole in the wall place. I cant recall what the hubby had but he said it was what you'd expect out of a chain.The main calling here is all the drink variety. I had a friend who wanted to try this place out and lives just to far away to trek out on her own so we went ahead one day she was in the area anyway and had stopped by for a  visit.  Please note my friend is type one diabetic who had just gotten off a 9-4 shift and hadn't really eaten since breakfast so she needed to eat.  The first time we had come we had been talked into getting a rewards card and I had gotten a half off large pizza offer w/free mini pizone so we decided to split a build your own. We could tell our waitress was having an off night, we all do, so we were patient with the slower service, its a Saturday night after all. We got our pizza, about 45-1hour in and my friend originally was turned off by the tomatoes ... our bad, no big deal we can scrape them off ... then we start eating and find other random toppings in our pizza, stray toppings maybe? When our waitress came back my friend was just going to order something else but I asked why we had all of these extra topping on our pizza and at first she asks us ""did you read the menu and see what toppings came on what you picked?"" until she remembered we ordered a build your own and put our order in wrong. No big deal, just don't yell at us about reading the menu when it wasn't our bad. After that was when it got weird. We ended up having a manager come take our order again, then we waited another 45 mins for our pizza to come out. So much for shopping at this point ... then when it came out it was wrong again. We flagged our waitress down and said we're done, we'll pay but we've been here nearly two hours and our orders been taken wrong twice. She ran and got another manager instead of dealing with us, he offered to comp our meal, but at that point my friend who really needed to eat was just wanting to leave to & get a sub sandwich to get her blood sugars  into check.

46,Justin B.,"Broken Arrow, OK",644,277,113.0,5.0,2014-02-25,"I'd somehow managed to never heard of BJ's Brewhouse until a visit to the DFW area over the summer.  After doing just a bit more of opening my eyes, I see they are in many different cities.  Still, this location at Northeast Mall in Richland Hills (or Hurst?) is the only one I've ever been to. This place is quite the treat in many ways.  I've been five times and had a different server on each visit.  Every time the server was professional but also had good humor and really seem to want everyone to have a good and quality experience.  They're quick with recommendations and offer some insight into what might be best paired with a particular beer- more than I'd usually anticipate a server being able to do accurately.  They've even been quick and witty with responses to questions and comments made by the more mischievous diners in my group. If you've never been to a BJ's, then you might not know that the menu is overwhelming and full of options.  Without having counted, there are easily around 100 dishes to pick from.  So far, I've tried burgers, fish and chips, Cajun pasta, and a few different chicken dishes.  They offer sandwiches and pizzas, but I've yet to be in the mood to order that or a steak.  The burgers were good- probably not what I'd normally order with so many other things that are so delightful on the menu.  The Cajun pasta was seasoned nearly perfectly and had the right amount of spice.  The fish and chips seem to be popular and for good reason!  These are possibly the most delicious example of fried fish I've managed to have outside of the UK.  But the absolute best dish I've had at BJ's Brewhouse is the Balsamic Chicken.  Sounds like something that wouldn't be as amazing as it is, but this dish has consistently blown me away.  The chicken is lean and tender, served on a bed of fresh greens with the most incredible balsamic glaze on top.  This also comes with well-cooked onion straws, which work very well with the flavors.  White cheddar mashed potatoes finish off this delight and are the best mashed potatoes I've had (a side I usually don't even like). Of course, the biggest draw of this establishment is the beer.  BJ's Brewhouse has the most amazing beers.  I've tried about half by now and they've all been prime examples of perfection in brewing.  My personal favorite is the Hefeweizen, which is on the lighter side.  It has a very light taste that can take on different flavors, from refreshing and crisp to full and almost buttery.  Another that I've tried which is a great example of a dark beer is the PM Porter, which offers a flavors like chocolate in a beer.  The Irish Red is also very good, but I can't imagine picking it over the above two.  The great thing is that if you aren't sure which one you will like, you can get a sample glass, which is more that enough to help you make up your mind. For an experience with all the ambiance you'd expect from an upscale brewery, this BJ's Brewhouse location is a difficult experience to beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=60,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.124,3.0000000000000004

The last time I went there I ordered my usual. The same thing I get EVERY time. But, guess what? Instead of my french dip being served with au jus (you know- like all French dips are) they served it with this gross balsamic, oil dip. Ew! I was so grossed out and disappointed. I complained to the waitress thinking they had given me the wrong thing only to be told that's what they serve it with now? Really? That's interesting because that's not a French dip. There were some things wrong with the orders of other people at the table but you know it gets to the point that there is no point complaining any more.  Sad. I loved this place so much and now it's been 6 months since I've gone back.  If you decide to go- get the pizza.

118,Mindy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",155,344,68.0,3.0,2015-12-08,"BJ's normally has QUICK SERVICE. I've found that you can order something very last minute and if you go to pick it up, it'll be ready when you get there. Even if you're calling in the order from the car whilst already driving. Although they are not reliable when it comes to their curbside pick up. I've had to go inside to get my order every single time I've tried to do curbside. What happens is that you are suppose to call the number on the sign, in the curbside pick up spot. Then someone is suppose to answer and bring out your food. No one has ever answered, thus making me go inside to get it. Completely makes the curbside pick up offer USELESS.  I've also encountered that they do not handle a group of 10+ very well. Most restaurants might struggle with a large group too so I discount this fact. Anyways...  AVOCADO EGG ROLLS, you'll WANT THEM. For those who don't know, egg rolls are not any type of traditional food. They were invented in America/for Americans. So to say they are good for something ""Americanized"" isn't completely correct, but you get where I'm going with it. They have a great amount of avocado in them. They come fried and with a sweet dipping sauce. The sweet dipping sauce is very good but you can tell how terrible it is for you. Not that the rest of it is much healthier either haha. They are categorized as a shareable appetizer, but for someone with a small appetite, it can definitely be a meal.  They have a decent lunch specials menu, beginning at $5.75. They have an unlimited salad and soup option, which is always good for variety. I don't particularly like their caprese salad but I can be a cheese snob. It's another option next to traditional salad options; cesar or house. They have a strong tomato bisque soup and their broccoli cheddar is VERY GOOD. They also have a one topping personal pizza option, which kind of sucks. It's ~$7.75 and then 50 cents extra per topping. For an already small option, it's not priced accordingly in my opinion. Their pizzas are VERY GREASY THOUGH and could use more pizza sauce. I normally DON'T ORDER THEIR PIZZAS. But I think their known for them? I've had some of their other entrees and their salads, so you can't really go wrong here as a quick, good lunch option. Dessert here is SO GOOD. Pazookis (is that how you spell it) which you get one for free on your bday. Is a type of cookie and a type of ice cream scooped on top. The cookie is warm so it melts the ice cream a bit. It's just the right PERFECTNESS you want and expect from BJ's. It's their twist on the traditional molten cakes a lot of ""American"" restaurants offer.  My normal chain restaurant disclaimer: I like to comment more about the service, cleanliness, and the process experience when it comes chain restaurants because these are the main factors that vary between them. They all have the same menu. Although I go into more details regarding the menu here because despite this being a large chain, I have known many people who haven't had it before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0520000000000005,3.1200000000000006

I asked the hostess if we could have a booth for two (at least 10+ open that we could see) and she asked if we could give her a couple of minutes; it seemed that sorting the stack of menus was the priority. While being seated at the booth, the hostess asked if we were ready to order...literally before we even had a menu in our hands. I said that we will need to look at the menu. After another 10 minutes of sitting in the booth without being greeted... I went back up to the hostess and asked if we had a server. She said yes, but they are busy right now. That's fine...but plenty of employees were walking around and socializing in front of our booth...yet nobody realized we had been waiting there, not even the manager. Finally, someone acknowledges us after being instructed to be another hostess. I ordered a glass of wine...another 10 minutes passes before that arrives. We order our food. ThAt comes out and I have to ask the food runner to grab us ketchup. Also had to ask another sever if the garlic bread is coming... it was supposed to be with the pasta but wasn't delivered to our table.

The soup was SALTY beyond belief, and could not be eaten.  Because I normally am on a low salt diet, sometimes others do not have my reaction but after tasting it, all at my table reacted the same way, as did the waitress.   The over saltiness is a major issue.  However, though the waitress was sympathetic and offered me a substitute of anything else (this particular menu option features unlimited refills of soup/salad), I was not able to report the offensive soup until the check had been delivered and others were finished with their meals.  I did try a small amount of the clam chowder and it was better though not something I would ever order again. The wedge was acceptable as was a companion's caesar salad (dressing also very salty).  One friend loved her fried chicken and a mini pizza received a 'just OK' verdict. We wonder why the chef, if there is one, does not taste the soup?  The kitchen appears to be poorly supervised.  Service was a bit slow, and especially in this situation, I would have appreciated a courtesy stop by the waitress to assure that everything was OK.  I could never catch the eye of anyone to report the Salt soup.  Many other restaurants would likely have comped my meal.

They balanced crispy fried wings that were super moist once snapped into, with a sweet, sticky Root Beer flavor glaze. Did not anticipate them being that darned good, and how much? Zero dolla make honey boo boo holla. And all because they have an app. Also, rewards members get to cut in line for a table or reserve a seat and order ahead. A Yessiree.

Honestly, I get this dish like every time I go to BJs and you will chew it down in no time. The chicken is tender and eating that with some potatoes will definitely hit the spot. I went with a party of about 14 people and half of us got this dish. It was not the BEST southern fried chicken I had from BJs but it was good enough for me to make the plate clean at the end. So if you are looking for something filling and inexpensive, I would suggest getting the Southern Fried Chicken! Other than the food, we got seated within 10 minutes and got our food in a reasonable amount of time. We did go on a Saturday night so it was a little full but not extremely crowded. Location is in a great spot. I would recommend this place anytime!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=40,3.68,3.43,3.43,,3.5300000000000002
26,TheBaby D.,"Tampa, FL",0,53,23.0,1.0,2017-07-15,Whelp this is the first time I have ever eaten in this restaurant. My experience was NOT GOOD. I want to know who is in the kitchen preparing the food. I ordered a simple dish without any kind of special requests. I was with a party of 11 people which can be a little overwhelming to some staff and I get that. I ordered a clam chowder sourdough bowl which was good. My main dish was the chicken fried steak with all the fixins on it. The first order was incorrect I received the wrong chicken steak so the second trip was also incorrect and it actually belonged to another person in our party who they never acknowledged which meant he had to wait longer for his meal. They offered to attempt a third time that's when I declined. GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!! how about that. The damn place wasn't even crowded yet. They say first impressions are everlasting. Several people in our group had messed up orders not just me. NO GOOD,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=40,3.56,3.42,3.42,,3.4760000000000004

Deep dish Mediterranean pizza was pretty good I'd have to say, along with the bacon Ranch pizza. Yum. I really liked their Sriracha brussel sprouts. I would definitely order those again. Everyone enjoyed the food.  Dessert ruled the day! Monkey bread pizookie was awesome, followed by salted caramel and chocolate.  It's  a lot of chocolate though in the triple chocolate so you have to love chocolate.  I think we ordered every dessert they had just about.  Overall, good service,  good food, good ambiance and great dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst,3.48,3.4,3.4,,3.4320000000000004

I ordered the baked potato along with my favorite Parmesan crusted chicken which blended well. (The broccoli is weird tasting, can't identify why, never order it again). The butter on the potato tasted old and just took it off. Love the Jeremiah Red Craft brew, very flavorful and blends well with the chicken. Ordered a monkey bread pazookie which is always good and freshly made. Ice cream is a vanilla bean which is good just by itself.

1,Dru T.,"Denton, TX",41,101,104.0,4.0,2017-10-11,"I am becoming a regular at this location lately, and here some observations from my recent visits: The positives: Waitress Rachel S was an excellent server, was kind, attentive and helpful.  I love their flatbread pizza and wings.  The two go together excellent.  I love their Lightswitch Lager as well. I like their selection of TVs everywhere playing sports. Their pizookies are ridonkulous. (Good) Negatives: one time out of several visits, my flatbread was lukewarm and chewy and did not seem fresh like the other times. The same visit my beer was warm. Might have been a fluke situation, as those two things have been consistently excellent every other visit.  The wings are very hot and even the regular mild wings make my nose run, which is awkward with cloth napkins.  I don't want to blow snot in a napkin that will be reused.  That being said, our waitress brought me a stack of cocktail napkins when I brought it up and that helped. The price is pretty high, it's kind of low lit at night, and they keep it FREEZING in there.  I always bring a jacket, even in Summer. All that being said, I go pretty often and I do love it.  Just dress warm, bring your own napkins or wet wipes, and make sure you have an extra 40 or 50 bucks in your account.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst,3.44,3.4,3.4,,3.4160000000000004
106,Cheryl B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,10,3.0,3.0,2017-10-31,"Eat here about once a month. Generally the service is good - every once in a while you may get someone slow or who just doesn't seem to want to be there. Food has always been good except for my visit last night.  Ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon and started eating on the thin end. (Wish they would just cut it to a proper filet and lower the price) When I got to the thickest part of the salmon it was not completely cooked (raw). Sent it back and the waitress came back with - ""the cook says it is cooked properly and is not raw"". I HATE being argued with about whether my food is cooked properly. She said she would bring me a new one (no thanks) or to put that one back on the grill some more. The cook offered to do that even though he said it was cooked. I opted for cooking it more and taking it home. Had it for lunch today and it was cooked all the way through. However I did have to pick pin bones out of it. Go figure.  Also had an issue with their points program - happens a lot - but it finally got straightened out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=20,3.36,3.41,3.41,,3.39

If I was mining for Kale I would be broke because not a single, leaf of the salad greens was actually Kale. I guess they believe their customers are stupid or don't know the difference. I addition, the Brussel sprouts were cold, bland and limp like they boiled them a couple of days ago. Oh, BTW did I mention it took an employee 10min at the peak of the lunch hour to come from the kitchen to take my order? Fool me once shame on me...fool me twice, shame on me.

It's phenomenal. My food of choice would be the chips and queso & California Club Flatbread, it has a nice crunch to it and the flavors are spot on delicious. I also can't leave without the cookies & cream pizookie. I usually order it without the whip cream garnish and it melts in my mouth. The heat of the freshly baked cookie and the cold of the creamy ice cream is a huge wow factor. BJ's menu has something for everyone. The drinks are great as well, I enjoy the Long Island Ice Tea and my husband is a huge craft beer drinker.  The overall atmosphere is really nice, we usually go on the weekends due to multiple TVs with different sports showing. If you go with a group bigger than 4 people I would recommend going in the afternoon or doing call ahead seating in the evenings to minimize your wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst,3.6,3.43,3.43,,3.498
