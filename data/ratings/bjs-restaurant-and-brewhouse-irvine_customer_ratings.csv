460,Emilio G.,"Santa Ana, CA",127,20,7.0,2.0,2012-01-04,"I have been a client of this particular location for many many years now, I have been here at dinner time, lunch time and brunch. I have been at this place waiting outside in the cold for over 45 minutes when they are slammed, I know quality and service at this place, that's why I have to give them this particular harsh review. THere are 2 things I like about my food, my food being fresh and I like asking questions about my food so that I can educate myself and the person who is waiting my table educates me, it is a give and take situation for me. I am very open minded and tolerant when it comes down to food, and since I have worked at waiting tables before, i know how difficult it could get.  During my last visit, I noticed it was not very busy, not a lot of people eat out on a tuesday night. I had a great date at the Laguna play house and I thought I would close the date by having dinner in a place I knew and introduce my date to something she had never experienced, that went sour really fast. It took a very long time to get our drinks ordered and since my date was new to the place and BJ's brews their own beer, I asked the waitress to explain the differences of beer to my date, the flat out answer was "" beer is just beer, just darker colors"". I felt offended and I thought about leaving inmediately and ask for a manager but my date asked me not to. Next thing, was ordering an apetizer, I love the avocado egg rolls here, but that night, they came with ice, that's correct, you read correct, the sliced carrots that came with my hot egg rolls had Ice in them, when I asked where the ice came from, I was told it came from the freezer.  I asked for my bill, got up and left. I ended up in tacos de anda in downtown santa ana that night eating burritos and drinking horchata and happy. I will never come back to this location on a tuesday night. I hope people who run this place train all of their staff to be poeple friendly and give proper explanations of the products they are serving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=560,3.12,3.49,3.49,2.8560000000000003,3.342

466,Sarah C.,"Redwood City, CA",335,284,124.0,2.0,2012-01-11,"This BJ's is definitely better than the one back home in Tanforan. Every time i've come here it's been really clean and there has never been a wait. The food is okay too, but if you really want to score a deal come for happy hour. Ah yes, happy hour! Half off deep dish pizzas, a couple dollars off of appetizers, and depending on the night really good deals on drinks. My only problem with this is that i've never had good service when i've come for happy hour. I understand the bar area gets busy but it's still no excuse for bad attitude, messing up on orders, and extreme waiting times. On one occasion our waitress gave my party serious attitude and then decided to complain about us to the bartender. WOW. You do realize we're sitting a few tables away and that we can hear what you're talking about right?  The second time was more recent and my boyfriend and I went to happy hour for a few snacks. The waiter was obviously frazzled from all the tables he was dealing but that's no excuse for forgetting to put in an order! I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad it never came out. I know you think you're cool and you can remember people's orders but if you're going to screw up you should probably write it down in the future. I also asked for ranch and he completely forgot about it until I reminded him and he was like ""oh yeah you asked for that"".   The manager was going around some of the tables asking about dinner. He went to the table next to us and the people complained about long waiting times. It ends up the waiter forgot to put in their order. Too bad the manager didn't swing by my table, I would've complained about my missing order!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=560,3.0,3.47,3.47,2.8880000000000003,3.282

We went for a birthday lunch recently and were seated quickly, but when I told the server we were expecting 2 more people she said to inform the hostess. So we did and then nothing happened and our guests were actually standing because they had no where to sit. Finally my husband dragged another table over and 2 chairs to add to ours.

415,Vanessa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",297,987,78.0,3.0,2012-02-06,"Once again I break my No Chains Rule to review an establishment whose food, service, and overall experience is meant to be uniform no matter which location you enter. Normally BJ's is a 4-star kinda place for me; I'll admit it. Their pizza is deeelish, and the Great White is one of my favorites. They have a good selection of beer, including their own house brews, and are usually clean and well-kept. But because of my solidly 2-star experience over the weekend, I'm averaging it out to 3 for this review. We had a group reservation, with a preset menu, for 21 at 6:00 on Friday night. The idea was that our pre-ordered food would be ready AT 6:00, and we could begin eating immediately. At 6:00, however, the front of the house folks insisted that we needed more people in our party in order for us to be seated. I get that you'd need this for a regular reservation (and it's a long shot to think that all 21 people would be on time), but for a group event where the food should ALREADY be ready, I'm not sure what the point is of making people wait simply because we haven't met some imaginary quota. Well, come to find out that the food ISN'T ready, and won't be ready for another 30-45 minutes. This was irksome not only because it wasn't what we had signed up for, but because some of us had pre-paid the event organizer and needed to grab a bite and leave early (and it would have been even MORE irksome to pay for food that we didn't end up eating). It was a disappointing experience -- not enough to prevent me from coming back, but enough to make me think twice about hosting a group event here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=520,3.12,3.46,3.46,3.1800000000000006,3.3240000000000007

710,Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238.0,4.0,2012-02-16,"I rarely update my reviews and I am not a huge fan of reviewing chain restaurants, period, or chain restaurants. However, I recently moved within walking distance of this restaurant and have the opportunity to experience it on a different level, more often. They have a very good selection of beers on tap. While not huge, they have some decent microbrews, including their own, that most places just don't have. For example: I'm a huge fan of stouts and porters. If I am LUCKY a place MIGHT have Guinness on tap. They have a house porter and IMPERIAL stout (high alcohol content.)  They also have a red ale, which no one seems to do anymore. I guess there aren't enough Englishmen in OC to make it worth the while for most places. They do a happy hour on Sundays with pints around the $4.50 mark. Not bad at all. They do not, however, discount their appetizers during their Sunday HH. The food is ok. I liked the avocado egg rolls a lot. The avocado becomes very creamy and it comes with a sweet and sour sauce that goes very well. Their spinach artichoke dip is pretty good, but it's got a lot of cream cheese in it, almost to the point where it feels like filler. I hate, hate, hate the name 'pazookie'. Did a 7 year old come up with that name? Regardless, it's good. Cookies should be warm and covered with ice cream. I like that you can get three minis and mix and match. That was a fun way to try a few. Their cookies n cream was the best, being an Oreo based cookie. Their pizza still is not good. But, I hate deep dish pizza. I don't like eating a soggy pizza flavored, meat pie. If I want pizza, it should be crispy crust, whether thick or thin. Their menu is way, way too big. It's seriously a dozen pages. It's just tacky. Maybe if they had the bar and food menu separate it would be better, but I have to sit there and study a spiral bound menu for 15 minutes at the bar. I would say they have a 'little' of everything, but they kind of have a lot of everything. I can understand having a couple sandwiches, burgers, etc. Instead they have about 10 kinds of burgers, a dozen sandwiches, several steaks, multiple dinner salads, it's overwhelming and irritating for the customers. Service has been excellent here. The bar staff knows their beer and are friendly and prompt. One of the few places where they are good at letting the customer pace their meal, instead of either rushing them or disappearing for eternity. Their bar area is a little too crowded. The tables are stacked right next to each other with barely room to get in or out. I recommend sitting at the actual bar, if you are going to be in the bar area. Good, cheap beer and friendly service will keep me coming back. Overwhelming menu with average food will push me to other places, but keep BJs in the rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=780,3.12,3.49,3.49,3.248,3.342

756,Brittani B.,"Irvine, CA",0,14,,2.0,2012-03-19,"I came here with my best friend on Saturday. I was extremely excited to come especially once I saw the stuffed baked potatoes. We started off with 2 appetizers.  First was the Spinach Artichoke Dip. I have never in my life disliked any Spinach Artichoke Dip, Never! This was by far the worst. I believe it's due to the Alfredo Sauce they use. It's insanely bland and really has no flavor at all.  Then we had the Chicken Wraps: These were actually really good. Nice crisp lettuce and the hot mustard sauce hits you like Wasabi. It MUST have wasabi in it because nothing clears my sinuses like Wasabi. It was great! Next I had a ""Wedge Salad"" Now let me say.....I have NEVER disliked Blue Cheese....NEEVER! It was so gross. It was sweet...and tasted nothing like blue cheese. It also had some type of green seasoning in it...Again...I was disappointed.  Then out came my Entree....Chicken Alfredo: silly me, I should have known to change my order once I tried the Spinach Artichoke Dip. This meal was horrible to say the least. It tasted like.....nothing.....it' really had no taste at all. It was a flavorless sauce, with flavorless noodles, flavorless broccoli and four tiny pieces of chicken.  I was going to suck it up and eat it....but then I thought to myself....I paid way too much for this to have to force myself to eat it. So I sent it back and ordered something else.  The General Manager came over, he was VERY nice and approachable. I explained my concerns about the flavorless Fettuccine and my issues with the salad. He brought me out a Bacon Cheeseburger and took the Entree and Salad off of my tab. He did what he could to make it right. But of course ONE last jab...my thoughtful best friend waited for me to get my food before she ate....she ordered her Burger WELL DONE....and it came out bloody....so now here I am with my food....and she is waiting for hers... At this point....the baked potatoes that had my mouth watering in the first place....wasn't even an option anymore....I wasn't in the mood for anymore disappointments. It became so insane that we just ended up laughing about it.....never will we come here again....but it was kind of funny.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=720,3.16,3.49,3.49,2.9840000000000004,3.358

Surprisingly my favorite things to order on the menu aren't the pizza dishes which is what everyone seems to love above everything else. Here's my top 3: (1) Medium rare rib-eye steak with crispy thin cut fries and a jumbo baked potato. Normally it comes with just sour cream and butter but my servers always gladly gives me a generous free side of cheese and bacon. (2) Any of their burgers!!! their HUGE and totally worth the money and they come with those crispy thin cut fries that i love so much as well. One of the newer additions, BJs bacon cheeseburger is a new favorite of mine.  (3) Gourmet mac and cheese... I always loved mac and cheese so of course I always like to order this. 3 cheeses and bacon included with bread crumbs on top. Best of all, it's only 4 dollars... too good to be true.

I've tried a lot of things on their menu and everything tastes pretty good so go ahead and order whatever you desire.  Their pizza is probably the safest choice. Or the burgers. BUT...if you're like me, you're not at BJ's for the food. You're there for the PIZOOKIE. Just get it. I don't care if you're full. GET A PIZOOKIE.

232,Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,1424,6055.0,3.0,2012-05-16,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is OK. I wouldn't consider it comfort food however, it's definitely consistent; you know what to expect and you know what you're getting. So, yesterday, when friends suggested meeting up here for dinner, there was no argument from me.  Lots of parking as it's in the Marketplace of Jamboree but know that there's a handful of restaurants nearby so though there's parking, you might have to walk a bit.  Service was pretty good last night. Our server (forget her name) was pretty attentive even with our party (6) being seated out on the patio. She was on the spot with refills with our adult beverages as well as not argumentative when we let her know that the appetizer plates were all dirty.  Food was OK. We all split a pizza, Jambalaya and some fish dish. Again, the food is OK. it's not great though it's definitely not fast food. This is a chain so like I mentioned, you know what to expect. The selection of beer seems to be growing from what I remember. As a fan of craft beer, I appreciate how there wasn't ads for the inexpensive, domestic beer that you can pick up anywhere. If I were just reviewing the brewhouse, my rating would be one star more, but for the most part, and in general, BJ's is OK in my book.

800,Heather G.,"Indio, CA",14,34,9.0,3.0,2012-06-18,"Bj pizza lovers beware! Stand up and raise your voices! I will start by saying that my star value on food would have been a 1 but when you factor in service from both the management and our waitress I gave BJs a 3. My husband and I love this chain and frequent it often. Which can be hard since we do not have one within a 60 mile radius. Needless to say we enjoy the atmosphere, the service and the pizza. Sadly we might not be able to say this for much longer. Last night we arrived waited 45 mins for a table for 4 of us, normal for a Saturday night, and we were fine with it. But we were famished once our dinner arrived. The sweet pig pizza looks a little different than normal, dry to say it kindly. After one bite we were all immediately disappointed. And despite how hungry we were no one at more than one slice. The pizza had NO flavor, it was dry and fell apart when you bite into it. Not BJs style. It was so bad that I had to ask out waitress if something had changed. I was not complaining or sending it back that is not my style. I just wanted to know if I was off or the pizza was. I was even a little embarrassed when I asked her. Because really how could a pizza place change their signature dish to something as plain and unappetizing as what we were just served. But sadly I am right, BJs in the Tustin market place is testing a new 6min pizza. Yes I said 6 minutes and that's not a typo! It is a piss poor attempt to fool you the consumer into thinking you are getting a quality made to order pie, when in fact half of the pie is pre made before you even walk in the door! Dominos doesn't even do that! And may i mention Dominos tastes a hell of allot better than this new pizza and is half the price. So if you are eating at this BJs or any or for that matter and the pizza is off don't think the establishment is having an off night. Say something to the manager on duty or we we all loose the yummy pizza that made this chain so popular!  Or if you do not want to risk it simply call ahead and ask if they are serving the 6 minute pizza or their traditional recipe. That's what we are doing. Good luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=820,3.56,3.43,3.464,2.732,3.482

When we arrived on a Saturday night for dinner we were greeted by our waiter. We ordered water, the traditional wings for an appetizer, and the BJs Favorite Pizza without onions for our dinner. The wings arrived and they were great. We enjoyed them and neatly stacked our side plates onto the platter indicating we were finished. We assumed the plates would be cleared in a timely manner.    This is where the evening took a turn for the worst.  We waited and waited for our plated to be removed from the table. Our water glasses were empty, no one noticed or cared. Our waiter passed by our table 15 times and the empty platter full of chicken wing bones, and side plates remained uncleared. Finally, a busboy cleared our appetizer plates 25 minutes after we finished. This would be acceptable and tolerable if our waiter was busy or preoccupied. Instead our waiter was bantering with other coworkers.   After the busboy finally removed our plates we waited another 10 minutes for our BJ's Favorite Pizza to arrive. When it arrived it arrived cold and with onions. We kindly asked the waiter to re-heat the pizza. We waited an additional 15 minutes for our pizza to arrive and it arrived luke warm. We grabbed a slice for each of us. Then flagged down our waiter, explained it was still cold and requested that he box it to go.  The manager brought our to go box back to us and some what insulted my ethics. He stating the box of the pizza he was holding warm. I explained to him first of all the pizza arrived with onions when I ordered it without onions, and furthermore, the waiter removed the pizza from our table within 2 minutes of delivering it a second time with his bare hands. He didn't use the pot holders and that clearly indicated the pizza wasn't hot. The manager responded with the metal pan doesn't retain heat. His response was unprofessional and condescending.  I wouldn't return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=520,3.44,3.37,3.448,2.5320000000000005,3.398

499,Kaung K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,6,,4.0,2012-06-25,"So I got invited to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Irvine to celebrate a friend's belated birthday.  (Yes, I have friends and yes, I get invited to parties!) Environment: What can you say, it's in Irvine and at the Irvine Market Place so it is a pretty busy neighborhood with many stores and restaurants nearby. Which is a good thing by the way. I mean you don't want to go to a restaurant that is at a quiet dark corner yonder, do you? I don't think so! You don't have to worry about parking space either because there is a huge lot. I cannot guarantee you will find a spot but since I went there at night around 10 PM, there were many open spaces. It might or might not be the same for peak hours or ""day hours"". Service:  The place is pretty packed even at that late hour! Both outside dining areas and inside are packed! I was just a ""visitor"" so the seat for us was already reserved (by walk in). I cannot really talk about the wait time to be seated (sorry!). But from what I've observed while waiting for my food to come, out of starvation but without hallucinations from hunger, I noticed new customers were seated fairly quickly. Even a large group of 10-13 got seated within at max 5 minutes. So, I guess not much of a wait time. (Again, keep in mind I'm talking about the late night hours). The waiters and waitresses are dressed in the BJ's nice uniforms; they all look formal more or less. I felt like eating at a high-class professional restaurant, except with some noises around from other tables. I mean what can I expect, right? Our orders were taken quickly and the waiter made sure we got everything we need by constantly checking up on us. Very nice staffs there! A waitress even helped put my leftover pizza I ordered larger size out of greed into a to-go box on my behalf! Thanks for that! Oh, the waiters (not sure about waitresses, and NO I am not checking out the guys - I don't swing that way) seem to have mood or Hawaiian or some sort of wrist bracelets. Maybe that's how they keep themselves all cheerful or how they cast yummy spells on the food they served! Who knows! It's a world full of wonders. Yup. Nobody said Thank You or Bye when I left though. I felt ignored. Somebody there owed me a hug! (Message me on here for preferences of the person who should give me a hug! Haha just kidding!) Food (Full Menu Here:  ): They have varieties of food and drinks. Here, I am just going to talk about what we ordered, especially me (no, not being conceited). You can check out their menu in the link I posted above though! Prices are aright for everyone and the food served can be shared too because it's a good size for a nice price! Wine & Beer: We ordered wine and beer. I don't know what kind because I don't drink much and I always let people order for me or jump into the easy bandwagon while ordering by saying ""Same as her/him"". But wine we ordered was pretty good and satisfying, so were the beer few others ordered. Pizza: or PIZZA!!! I ordered their new Gourmet Five Meats (Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, salami, Italian sausage and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.) pizza small size. Trust me, small is still big considering they have ""mini"" size below it! It came with about 5-6 slices; you can actually check how many slices each size is composed of on their menu, so you can have a good estimate. (Menu in the restaurant for sure, not sure about the online one). It was delicious!!! You can taste the mixture of everything. You know, sometimes the taste of meat and toppings did not sink into the crust/bread so it's like eating them separately. But BJ's pizza, mmmm mmmm!! Oh I think you can special order birthday cakes and have celebration too. Check with BJ's if you do need one! Noise: Just the usual noise you always hear at the restaurants with bars attached. But it is nowhere half as loud as Yard House though!!! (Or Dave & Buster's)!!!

However, lately it seems like this place has gone down hill. The service has been consistently bad -- bad attitudes, long wait times, dirty tables and or silverware, and you're just kind of made to feel like you don't really matter and the staff is annoyed that they work there.  The food has been pretty bad the last few times also. We were just there on Saturday and I ordered the chili giant potato, when it came out it smelled kind of funky and then I found a long, tubular, weird thing in the potato that looked like it had grown inside. After I took it out there was hardly any actual potato left. You could also see where it started on the outside of the potato and looked like there was possibly dirt on all the gross part.. It was pretty much a rotten potato that they cut into and put chilli on top of... so gross!  After letting the server know, the manager came and was pretty patronizing and said oh you just saw a little black right? And was getting ready to explain how potatoes have dark marks, etc. No. It was straight up a rotten potato and I didn't even get an apology from him or anyone! They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else, but no I wanted to barf after that. Can't believe that the cook would see that (he had to have seen it) and send it out, I could've gotten really sick and after thinking about it we had gotten sick the last time we ate there but thought it was something else.  I'm just blown away that I didn't get an apology and no one was even a little bit remorseful about the situation except for me for the fact that I went there.

Last night, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner because his mom sent us a giftcard.  Thankfully, the service was greatly improved from the last visit, but our pizza was awful (our appetizer and salads were ok).  When we were presented with the pizza, it was obviously a rush job done by somehow who didn't care and/or wasn't paying attention because it just looked messy - the toppings (pineapple and pepperoni) were not added in anywhere close to even amounts and the distribution was completely uneven.  Also, the pizza was little more than luke warm when it was served to us so it had obviously been left sitting and waiting because a pizza from the oven should at least be hot if served immediately.  Furthermore, upon biting into the pizza, we both wondered if any sauce was even on the pizza.  I pulled off my cheese and saw the tiniest bit of sauce in some of the crevices of the crust - it actually looked like someone put sauce on the dough and then wiped it off.   It was a disappointing visit and a waste of a gift card in my opinion.  I'm unsure if I'll come back to this location again due to the spotty service and food quality.  It's too bad because it's convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=700,2.84,3.15,3.42,2.536,3.026

The second time I went back, I went with a business partner and we sat in the restaurant.  We went early, so were seated immediately and I must say, I really like the relaxed atmosphere.  The lighting is really nice and it feels like a great place for a conversation.  I didn't notice this before, but they have the calories of everything listed on the menu.  I found this really depressing as everything worth ordering was chock full of calories.  I ended up ordering something that seemed reasonable calorie-wise, but I have to say I felt like it was not even worth going out once I saw how fattening all the food was and what my reasonable options were.  Anyway, waitress was nice enough but our food was not prepared as requested.  Some will say this is NOT the waitress' fault, but it is her job to check the food before bringing it out (I used to be a waitress) and she clearly did not as it was obvious the food was wrong.  My friend sent back his meal, but I kept mine as it was not that wrong and the kitchen was relatively slow in correcting their mistake.  There was the awkwardness choice of me eating my food while it was hot and then having to sit there with no food while he got his or just waiting for his food to come.  I chose to eat unnaturally slow so that I would have something left on my plate by the time his food came.  And then to be nice, I shared some of small meal with him so he could eat too.  When his food came, he offered to share, but I didn't like what he ordered, so I ended-up with half a meal that night.

We usually order The Great White, which is a nice creamy Alfredo pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes and grilled chicken. My absolute favorite appetizer is the mini-Bruschetta. I don't even like tomatoes, but BJ's makes this dish so well.  Over the holidays, BJ's had a 2 for $20 special - 2 soups/salads, one medium pizza and one pizookie. We chose a half/half concoction for our pizza: The Great White & the Bacon Cheeseburger. Bacon Cheeseburger was surprisingly good. The only thing I would say is that it's a bit heavy compared to the rest of the pizzas at BJ's. Another time we went, we chose half/half of The Great White and the Buffalo Chicken. I have to say, this is now one of my favorite pizza combos ever. The Buffalo Chicken was so good - the pizza was drizzled with just the right amount of ranch and buffalo sauce (not overpowering at all), topped with diced celery and grilled chicken. The diced celery gave the pizza the perfect crunch and texture, I was in love from bite number 1.  As for appetizers, we've tried the clam chowder soup, the broccoli cheddar soup, tortilla soup and Caesar salad here. Everything is great, but soups are a little too salty. Tortilla soup is presented in an awesome way, with the toppings served in a bowl and soup poured over at the table. Pizookies are always great - my favorite remains the original chocolate chip cookie, but the Oreo and Triple Chocolate are yummy as well. If you ever need to take your pizookie to-go, let your server know and they'll have the kitchen bake your cookie in a tin pan for your convenience!

If you can find another restaurant, (which there are alot of in the surrounding area) please do so. If you are dying for BJ's, please go the extra mile and do not give this BJ's in Irvine your service.  I am not giving a poor review on BJ's because of their food, but on their service. BJ's in Irvine HAS TERRIBLE SERVICE. DO NOT GO HERE.Our waitress BRANDY was obviously having a terrible day and was not paying attention to our table at all and was throwing back all types of attitude during our entire stay. Never in all of our lives has a waitress thrown her finger at us to tell us to wait (really?). WE ARE NOT DOGS. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN. WE ARE CUSTOMERS, PLEASE HAVE SOME RESPECT. That immediately was an EARLY indication that the service here was poor. For the rest of our time here, she didn't look us in the eye when speaking and again, was throwing all types of attitude. REGARDLESS of the terrible service, my companions & I remained calm and cordial. She gave us the check and forgot the pizooki (really?) and we waited another 20+ minutes to order, get the check revised, and get dessert. Way before the dessert reached our table, my mood had already gotten sour.  We wanted to complain. All of my companions and I have worked in the food industry and have NEVER been treated like that nor have ever treated any of our customers like that in our life.A second waitress came, she was not too much of an improvement from Brandy. We asked for her name, and she just did not want to give it to us (really?). As we told her the situation from the previous waitress, it was so obvious that she was DESPERATE for us not to speak with the manager.  Regardless, we are calling management soon to let them know of the situation in hopes that another group of people just trying to eat a meal does not have to suffer the same crappy service we did.  I had higher expectations for this establishment and it let me down. BJ's in Irvine was a definite dissapointment. All I was trying to do was have a decent meal with companions in a chain I was familiar with.

Also got deep dish mini pizza and tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (it's a new one) and I was anticipating a creamy ranch sauce but instead it was a little dry and very bread-y. But then again it was deep dish so what do I expect ... $6 for a mini pizza. Not that worth it in my opinion but originally it's 10.95 so it's a good deal.  Service was excellent.

The place was packed and we waited maybe 10 minutes for a seat... No problem. We got seated and had a middle aged male waiter. Everyone ordered their alcohol, then it was my turn. What I like about BJ's is that they have fufu (non-alcoholic) beverages with refills. So I order some fufu flavored lemonade and as we chatted away, 4 of the 6 dinners come to the table. 10 minutes later the remaining meals arrive. At this point my drink is empty and as my husband is ordering another beer he tells the waiter that I need a refill as well. The waiter looks at us and in a rather annoyed tone says ""you're going to have to pay for the refill!"" I protest that their menu states that my drink has free refills and the waiter stares at us with a look of annoyance as my husband says ok to the charge for the refill. Of course as we were leaving the kids that work the hostess stand were too busy to discuss the charge. It wasn't about the additional $3 or $4 for the refill, it was his horrible attitude all together. Needless to say we have not gone back.

Well, the very first time they apparently messed up my pasta so they had to remake it. So the boyfriend and I waited for a very long time. They even forgot my bf's salad that came with what he ordered. I understood that it was busy and passed it off as nothing too bad. The waitress was very nice and did come check up on us. The reason why I am giving this location a 1 star rating is because of today's visit. We got seated at a table which seats four people, which I found weird, but understandable since there weren't many seats available. It all started to get bad near the end when we wanted boxes for our food. We waited for our server to come by so we could ask for a box. Tons of seats started to open up, people started leaving. Our server passed by us many times to attend to the one large table of people. All we wanted was a box and our check. I believe it took 20 - 30 minutes and she never even bothered with us. She had like 4 tables or less to take care of. We just wanted a box. Before the box deal my bf asked for a refill for me. She says she'll get me my refill then disappeared for a long while and then we had to flag her down to ask again.  What really bothered me was the boxes. It took 20 - 30 minutes to tell us they were out of large boxes. I just wanted to take home my potato. Another server had to box up the pizza for us and still I waited for them to find a box for me. They finally found a box and then we got our check after a few more minutes of waiting.  I was kind of irritated that she put our check in a cup. Uh, I doubt you ran out of those black check books. I didn't want to be pissy, but I was getting sleepy and tired of waiting for a box. She should have had someone deal with that simple task first if she was going to be busy with the ONE large table. The check in the cup, not sure if she was being a jerk to us by doing that. I just thought that was ridiculous. We didn't complain to her about anything, we just waited patiently for her to simply check up on us and she couldn't really even do that. I was treating my bf out tonight so I paid with cash.

We were told it was a 10 to 15 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I told my husband to go ask what happened. he was told we were still on the list. Then they call another party that came in after us. Finally we find out they say their computer system is down and instead of a party of 2, they have us as a party of 4 with a baby! Ugh, so then we get seated and they had the nerve to tell us that it's not THEIR fault, the computer is down. Umm, excuse me but you gave us the buzzer and it never went off, you were still giving other diners the buzzers and also telling them 10 to 15 minute wait. If it's not your fault, whose is it?Then we get seated. The menu pages are stuck together with FOOD. I'm afraid to order food now. FINALLY a waitress comes and takes our order. I figure coffee would be good and a salad. She brings the coffee and my husband's beer. We get our entrees and I ask for a coffee refill. After 10 minutes, no refill, no waitress. I ask another waitress because my husband is ready to go to the bar with the empty coffee cup. She brings the coffee - but no cream! How hard can this be! The servers here have not sense of wanting to actually SERVE anyone! The entrees come and they are just ok. The table next to us has their entrees served wrong - the salad wasn't tossed and the dressing wasn't served on the side - they are complaining. the table across from us gets a dessert that they never ordered - the server is wandering around trying to find where to serve it. Then I get my cream for my coffee.  Here is a piece of advice:  let the servers assigned to the table actually serve the food and take responsibility for their guests. Your serving system stinks!  If you order an appetizer be prepared for it to be served with or after your entree. The timing of this restaurant makes no sense. They have redone the menu and it is very confusing with too many choices and the menu selection is just plain dumb - they have 3 chicken sandwiches?!! Why?  There is a reason the Lazy Dog Cafe next door is doing so well. We don't come here much anymore and now I remember why.  If you just want a pizza and a beer come here. Otherwise, go to the Lazy Dog Cafe next door - where they know how to serve food and drinks.  Also, we looked for any NEVER saw a manager on duty.

I have had quite a few things off their menu and have never had a bad meal. Their rib eye steak was really good and their pizza flat bread is good too. Their signature pizza is deep dish but it is really tasty. They also have hand tossed but I have never ordered it. In my opinion their beer is only average and I have tried all of it. So I just order Stone's IPA, which they have on tap. You may like their beer but I'm a bit of a beer snob. The best dish on the menu is the by far the Jambalaya. Remember to order it half spicy unless you want your mouth on fire. I love spicy food and never order something half spicy but their Jambalaya is WAY TOO HOT. Order it half spicy and it is the best Jambalaya in Orange County. Whenever I go to a restaurant I always order Jambalaya if it is on the menu. So I have had it at half a dozen places and theirs is the best. Chaparosa Grill in the District in Tustin used to be the best but they closed. BJs has fair prices and you won't leave hungry.

567,Richard T.,"Irvine, CA",3,56,,4.0,2013-05-28,"I am not much of a fan for chain restaurant. BJ is a convenience since its only a mile from home. We do both take-out and dine-in. The food is good and the service is very good. The joint is professionally run including attentive service. The food is not greasy and my kids love it so I am a fan. My 8 and 10 year old sons love the spaghetti with meat sauce. The meat sauce is like catnip to them. For take-out we order the regular size spaghetti with extra meat sauce. I usually boil up extra noodles and mix it in with the extra sauce to feed both the boys. My kids are a fan of calarmari. BJ's calamari is fairly good but the portion is terribly small for even two young kids. When dining in, the child size spaghetti easily feeds each of them. My wife loves the mahi mahi with pineapple fried rice. Our first time experience with this dish included lots of pineapple. This made the dish very tasty. However, when we ordered the dish during our return trip, they sparingly added pineapple to the dish. This totally changed the dish and made it much less appealing.  Their deep dish pizzas remind me of the old Numero Uno pizzas. Thick and slightly sweet breaded type crust with a large variety of toppings to choose from. BJ's beers are bold in taste and also have a big bite to them which I am not particular to. No problem, they have a good selection of common commercial brands available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680,3.16,3.06,3.328,2.7359999999999998,3.1000000000000005

One random weekday night last week however, we couldn't find anything to eat that was open so we decided to give BJ's another try. It's hard to find something to order when everything on the menu has like 2000 calories, so eventually I ordered this weird bento-box thing that came with sliders, an avocado eggroll, salad, and fries (there was no calorie count on this item). It took 35 minutes to get my order! That must explain why my food was cold. The sliders were possibly the worst I've ever had -- the beef was super dry, overcooked, and there was no flavor or sauce of any kind. The fries would have been good had they been hot, but the avocado eggroll's skin tasted like tree bark.

522,Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1156,635,1484.0,3.0,2013-07-15,"First time I went to BJ's, and my experience overall was pretty positive.  Ordered: - calamari: I would not recommend this dish. It is $10 for the appetizer and the portion was smaller than expected. Also, they only gave us marinara sauce and two slices of lemon as condiments, and I was expecting a few more options (cocktail sauce would have been nice). In addition, the batter was kinda soggy and the calamari itself relatively flavorless. -Hawaiian mahi mahi from the ""enlightened menu"" (i.e. fewer calories): the fish itself was somewhat bland, but it was soft and the consistency was nice.

I've had their burgers, pastas and a handful of other apps and entrees and they've all been tasty, but the pizza is something special, especially with the tomato topping.

Its a thick slice (i.e. not the thin crust a la California pizza kitchen). The ingredients are average (typical of what you find in chain restaurants) and pizza is never too hot (i..e won't burn your tongue). So its a good option for parents and their kids maybe? I usually like getting the berry burst cider/beer combo drinks (1/2 cider + 1/2 beer, usually an amber ale). its a good option and probably one of my only reasons to really visit. parking is decent, despite being in a shopping plaza with other restaurants, this place always seems to be busy for dinner. There are times when I come with a group of friends and after finding ourselves stuck in a 30 minute wait, we usually opt to try to snag a table at the bar. This is good because we get seated sooner, but bad since they dont serve all your normal food they would to you, had they seated you at an actual table. but w'evs. the rest of the food here is mediocre. pastas are bland, salads taste processed and i really haven't had the courage to throw money away by trying anything else because really, how terrible must you be to mess up pizza and beer.

The Pizookie is a fresh and warm baked cookie (white chocolate, macadamia nut, chocolate chip, etc.) topped with ice cream and served in a mini pizza style pan. BJ's Restaurants Inc. is credited for creating this mouthwatering dessert that most of us enjoy. Not to mention the fact that this restaurant and microbrewery chain (with over 130 locations nationwide) also creates some enticing entrees that makes me cringe as to whether I should be eating something with such high calorie content. The Irvine location is always packed in the late evenings because the city is such a quiet community, that everything closes before 10PM. I've never really had any issues with the service here, except that they do sometimes rush you since there's so much foot traffic waiting to be served. The only other problem is finding something to eat, meaning I categorize my decision based on - Should I eat something fattening or go with something healthy? And the word healthy in this case, isn't all that safe and sound as you think. HERE'S YOUR BJ * Pick your style of pizza (deep dish, flat bread, hand tossed, gluten free thin crust). They're known for creating some delectable pies and these are my favorites - California Club, Black & Bleu, Great White, and BJ's Favorite. * Appetizers - Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Avocado Egg Rolls. * Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Roasted turkey breast, tomatoes, avocado, Applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese dressing, lettuce and Dijon mayonnaise. Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll. Don't forget the pickles, potato wedges, and ranch dressing. * Fresh Atlantic Salmon - Flame Broiled or Blackened Salmon fillet served with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf, and steamed vegetables. * BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp - Lightly fried Panko Crusted butterflied shrimp (made with BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer batter), served with thin fries, creamy coleslaw, house made tartar and cocktail sauces.

I've been to my fair share of BJ's locations, and they've all been pretty mediocre. However, I came to this location with my boyfriend this past weekend and had by far probably the best time I've ever had at a BJ's. It was pretty packed because it was the night of some local high school dance, and annoying super dressed up teenagers were all over the place in their 20+ people parties. I thought it was going to take us FOREVER to get seated, but it only took us five minutes (basically the whole time I spent using the bathroom LOL).  Then, the seating hostess originally took us to a table that's located in the back section of the restaurant that is in this echo-y, different room where they had basically seated all of the loud and obnoxious teenagers. As soon as I saw that we were being seated there, I felt uneasy and was already regretting it. Either me and the seating hostess had telepathy or she could just see the expression on my face, but she then asked us if we wanted to wait for a table inside, far away from the teenagers. We said yes, and she took us back inside and was able to find us another table to sit at which was MUCH better. Once we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our hostess who was very attentive and friendly. She took our orders and it literally took like...10 minutes to get all of our food. With the restaurant being super busy, my boyfriend and I was very surprised that our pizza came out speedily!  The only reason why I give this restaurant 4/5 stars is because we had ordered regular sized pizookies, and the ones we ended up getting were the small sized. However, we were not charged for the full size, so it was ok. Good job, BJ's!

When you've tried authentic Lou Malnatis in Chicago, this one will have to do in SoCal. The options are great and the servings here are pretty big. We ordered a mini to share with meatballs mushrooms and green peppers. They definitely loaded the pizza with meatballs. I like how their ""build your own"" come with fresh marinated tomatoes, If you like tomatoes this definitely adds that juicy bite to the pizza. I do have to say that our mini was more bready and airy than a deep dish should be, but it was less oily which was a plus. We also orders the nachos that came with no shortage of cheese and a surprise hot beans sauce on the bottom which was a nice compliment. To end, a gluten free pazookie was ordered. It came warm with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The first few bites were nice but once the ice cream starts melting you realize the cookie is way too sweet. This dessert is what BJs is known for, I'm glad there's a gluten free version but toning down the sugar in the cookie recipe would have been better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=620,2.8,2.93,3.192,2.604,2.878

I went here for my close friend's 21st birthday party. This is by far the WORST dining experience I have regretfully not enjoyed. First of all, there was a hair in my avocado egg rolls. I politely told the sever, so they removed the item, and the manager brought out a new avocado egg roll. So that was perfectly fine. However, we asked to split the check for a party of 11. The server informed me they don't split checks for parties of 8 or more because it is ""easier for the servers."" I politely asked for it to still be split since I know it can be done. I waited 45 minutes for this split check to be done and charged. My boyfriend had to go to the hostess podium to request someone over to charge our checks. On top of all of this?

Not wanting to indulge in one of the obnoxious pizookies (although the pizookie sampler looked good), we just got some vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup (not enough choc syrup in my opinion, but then again, I drink it right from the bottle!).  Again, the service was very good, and the communication was great.  I didn't like losing out server 1/2 way through the meal(mandatory breaks), but our replacement  was spankably yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=440,3.0,2.94,3.12,2.9600000000000004,2.9640000000000004

226,Sundos S.,"Santa Ana, CA",79,18,28.0,4.0,2014-03-16,"We love this place. Consistently great tasting food, always buzzing with a laid back vibe. We usually head towards the bar area for self seating and no wait. Same menu & sometime better service!  I've tried a variety of things here ranging from veggie jalapeño burgers to yummy happy hour finger food.  The winner of my BJ heart definitely goes to their Jambalaya plate. They are totally open to substitutions, since I don't eat meat they always don't mind giving me all shrimp rather than their trio of meat/shrimp. It's spices, balance of veggies/protein/carbs, and filling deliciousness is perfection. This time though, we decided to switch up our order and got the avocado egg rolls & stuffed mushroom appetizers along with a medium half buffalo chicken half vegetarian deep dish pizza. Wayyyy too much food for two people, definitely could have gone with the small pizza!  The avocado rolls were delicious, light and flavorful. Perfect appetizer, love the taste of the slightly warmed avocado in just the right amount of crispy. Sometimes, some food just makes you moan close your eyes and thank the heavens for good food. Those were the stuffed mushrooms for you. Little and delectable, the appetizer portion comes as six lil scrumptious mushrooms. Comes with a slice of lemon, we asked for more, squeeze em on for the most epic finishing touch to these guys. The pizza was good, the crust was phenomenal and so soft it was heaven in ma mouth. My vegetarian half came with roasted tomatoes, bell peppers, olives, and artichoke hearts (which I substituted for the onions). Good flavors, fresh ingredients, but for some reason I wasn't impressed. Good, but probably wouldn't order again. Overall great place to have a nice meal or have drinks and watch the game-we've never gone wrong here.

540,Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",64,83,238.0,5.0,2014-03-20,"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for happy hour on and off for the past year. Recently, we came across a very sweet waitress named Brittany. My boyfriend instantly liked her and I found that she was very attentive and good with customers. Today we witnessed something surprising and astonishing. We witnessed an act of kindness, something that I think is lacking in our society these days. My boyfriend and I entered the bar and found the last open table at about 6:05PM. A few moments later, a man came and looked around for an open table as well; there were none. He stood patiently against the wall and waited. Around the same time, Brittany had begun her shift and was walking around the tables introducing herself. Anyway, a table opened up about twenty minutes later; the man and another group from the other side of the bar got to the table at the same time. He generously gave the table up to them and went back to wait against the wall. I felt so bad for this guy and wanted hurry up and finish my meal so that I could give him our table but we were still waiting on some items to come out of the kitchen. Other waiters and employees walked back and forth, passing the man and ignoring him but Brittany noticed that he was still standing around and approached him. They talked for a minute and then she went to the front and had a few words with what looked like a manager. She came back to the man, directed him to the manager, and they sat him down in the main dining area. Brittany brought him the happy hour menu. Poor guy waited forty five minutes and made it just in time to order before happy hour was over. Props to Brittany for noticing him and helping him out. That was really awesome of her. My boyfriend and I were very moved by this and we honestly don't know if this happens often or not but we have never ever seen this take place before. I thought it was a really nice thing to do. Hell, it's almost midnight and I'm still shocked by the whole incident.  FOOD: I love the mini buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and my boyfriend is obsessed with the avocado egg rolls. A friend of mine always orders the potato skins. Mmm. Both the deep dish and egg rolls are $6 during happy hour. They have some good deals going on at that time. Happy hour takes place between 3PM - 7PM (which is why I like BJ's...I get off of work at 6PM and by then, most places no longer have happy hour) from Sunday to Thursday.  We will definitely be coming back again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=540,3.12,3.01,3.12,2.868,3.054

381,P B.,"Irvine, CA",143,12,67.0,1.0,2014-04-05,"Sorry for the novel, but I'm pretty upset. This was not my first visit to BJ's, but it may very well be my last.  Our party of 7 arrived at 5:10pm on a Saturday, and were promptly seated at 5:13. After we browsed the menu for 2 or 3 minutes, I was expecting our server to come by and introduce himself/herself to us and possibly offer to place our drink order. The dinner rush had not yet started, and I noticed that a group of servers were seated, chatting, at one of the empty tables on the other side of the patio. The diners that were seated around us were either eating or their food had just arrived, but none of those servers seemed to look in our direction. After waiting over 10 minutes, our server STILL had not come over...not even to tell us that he/she would be right back or to apologize for the wait! I was getting pretty impatient, so I decided to try to catch the eye of any servers/managers walking by. Finally, the hostess who had seated us saw my pointed stare and asked if we'd been helped yet. I replied, ""Not at all!"" And she promptly went to retrieve our server who had been MIA for so long.  By the time Jessica came to our table, I was able to give her our entire order (including drinks and appetizers), and the 4 kids in our party had finished the entire activity/coloring menu. She whisked our menus away, and promised to place our orders right away. I was starting to get pretty thirsty, so I was hoping she would bring our drinks out right away. We saw her come back to our area multiple times to check on her only other table, but every single time, she did not have anything for us. Tables that were seated AFTER us recieved their pitchers of beer, sodas, and even appetizers, while we were left to sit and watch as the other patrons finished up their meals and ordered dessert.  We did not receive our drinks until 5:45!! I have never been to any restaurant, whether busy or not, where I had to wait THIRTY MINUTES for mere tap water. It was ridiculous!! Jessica seemed very concerned about taking care of her other table however, and came to check up on them often! We did not get the same quality of service unfortunately, and when our food finally arrived (on her third trip to our table in an hour), she had accidentally ordered a kids chicken dinner instead of the kids chicken pasta. Our pizza was lukewarm and our fries were limp. Tables that had been seated after us had finished eating and had left. The dinner rush was now in full swing, and the hostesses were coming by to look at our table, probably wondering why we were still sitting there, taking up space. I let it go because I was starving, and we had a mediocre meal.  When it came time to pay for dinner, I had 3 gift cards. One had $50, one had $25, and one had $15. (I always write the gift amounts on the front of each card). Jessica came back with our bill and said the card with $25 had $25 on it, but the one that was supposed to have $15 only had $10, and the card with $50 had $0 left!! I was shocked, but she didn't bring me my 3 cards back so I can double check their card numbers against the balance slips she brought over. I asked another server to kindly return our gift cards with my writing on them, but she came back to our table saying Jessica said they were gone and they could give me 3 empty gift cards in return. Wow! Why do I need empty gift cards?  I sincerely hope Jessica was brand new, but because of tonight's ruined dinner, I have 799 Premier Rewards Points and I don't think I'm going to make it to 800.

261,Katie N.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,2.0,1.0,2014-04-20,"I've been coming to this BJ's for years and I've never experienced any major problems with service or food. In fact, I would have given 4 or 5 stars, but my visit two weeks ago was enough to knock all those stars off.  We came on a Tuesday night as a party of 12 for a birthday celebration. To start, we were nicely accommodated considering we had so many people arriving at different times and we hadn't made a reservation. We had a nice table on the patio outside, and we ordered drinks, appetizers, and food without a problem. We even got a complimentary pizookie for the birthday boy! Our servers were adequately attentive despite our party size and disorganization.  Everything was fine, and when the check came out, I was really happy with how the main server was working with us. She told me that we could write numbers next to each of our individual orders so she could split the master check into smaller checks to bring back for each of us. How nice was that?? The glaring problem began when one of my friends handed her credit card directly to our server to pay and never got it back. It was nearing closing time and we waited around for a bit, everyone got back their cards and signed off on their checks, and we were still missing one card.  We decided to ask our servers what was going on, and they were confused, as if they had never received that card. They went to look for it; the main waitress came back a couple of times to tell us she'd had no luck finding it.  Now, I understand that large parties can be more challenging to take care of. It was extremely kind of our server to even offer to split our bill with that numbering method. I understand that mistakes happen. But every time this server came back to our table to give us the bad news, she didn't seem apologetic in the least. In fact, she acted like it was one of our faults that the card couldn't be found. Maybe it was the fact that it was now well past closing and she wanted to clean up and go home, but her attitude was completely unprofessional. I was surprised that the manager didn't even come out to address such a big problem.  The waitress essentially told us to pay that portion of the bill because we hadn't given her the card, and that my friend could call back in the morning to see if it had turned up. Talk about a buzzkill for an otherwise good night! Oh yeah, and after my friend had already cancelled her card, BJ's found it the next day in one of the check books, just as she remembered giving it to our server. Maybe the waitress just wasn't in the mood to look very carefully that night.

553,Riggz D.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,1.0,2014-05-13,"Let's start off by saying, BJ's lives up to its name, it sucks dick. Most servers (in this location) are snobby, uneducated, selfish, and self entitled imbeciles. I cannot believe how careless they are about their customers. For instance, my girlfriend asked for Parmesan and ended up asking the hostess. How is that appropriate? Come on give me a damn break, Blow Jobs! How can you treat or let your servers commit to such atrocious behaviors? Maybe you should send them to server boot camp to actually hone their skills in serving customers properly not carelessly and idiotically.  Another instance, I was there with my grandparents for their 70th anniversary for dinner. Our server took forever to take our orders and drinks. This server had curly blonde hair. After 20 minutes, she finally takes our order and by then my grandparents were very irritated. When the food came, I was very happy until I found a curly pubic-like hair on my fries. I was absolutely disgusted and it ruined my dinner with my grandparents. I honestly cannot stand this location. Just passing by it makes me vomit. Please close down or fix your staff because it's extremely negative for your business.

152,Andrew C.,"Irvine, CA",297,2,2.0,1.0,2014-05-23,"I came here to watch the Super Bowl with a group of friends and the cheeseburger I ordered gave me food poisoning. That aspect of my experience can be forgiven.  What makes me  give this place one star is my experience with Howard, the general manager.  Howard is a complete jerk. I came in today to complain about my food poisoning, and was referred to Erin. Erin was very considerate and professional. He brought back his general manager however, who basically accused me of lying.  I told Howard that I had gotten sick the night of the super bowl, and that the next day I called in to complain. I told him that they referred me to human resources who told me they were going to send me a gift card for compensation. Upon waiting a few weeks and receiving nothing in the mail, I called back only to have an employee tell me they were going to personally send me a gift card. Again, i waited a few weeks and received nothing.  I happened to be in the area today, and decided to complain in person. Upon telling Howard my story, he questioned me as to the names of the HR person and the employee I talked to. Considering that this happened a while ago I couldn't remember. He then proceeded to say that my story ""didn't sound legitimate"". He asked me how much i wanted on the gift card in a manner that suggested I was being unreasonable. I told him ""however much"". He replied by saying ""since the burger you ordered is only $10 I think that's how much you should be compensated"" I chose not to call him out on his attitude considering I was with my little sister, but was very tempted to go off on him. not only was he unapologetic towards the fact that I had food poisoning and was forced to miss class for a week, but he was trying to make it seem like I was making stuff up just to get a gift card. He turned to Erin and said ""whatever just put $10 on the card and give it to him"". He then proceeded to walk away from me as if I had just wasted his time.  I want to make a point in this review that Erin displayed an exceptional attitude. Upon giving me the gift card, he made sure to thank me for my time and told me to have a good day. He was very polite and attentive.  It is beyond me how that douchebag of a general manager got hired to run this place. He is incompetent when it comes to customer service. $10 in no way makes up for the experience of getting food poisoned, being stuck in bed, and being forced to miss important class time. I will be sure to take my business elsewhere in the future to watch sporting events with my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=220,3.16,2.98,3.044,2.116,3.0520000000000005

The manager passed through our section several times without saying anything to me about my meal until I finally flagged him down to let him know I was very dissatisfied with my experience and the wait. The manager said he had already made sure the kitchen was on top of our order, however after waiting for an hour to get our food they didn't comp or discount anything on my bill. Not even the drinks.

We found the Manager after our meal and told him that we had a great experience because of Jennifer. The food: I ordered the new Angel Hair Classico pasta with blackened chicken.

340,Beth T.,"Irvine, CA",114,39,,2.0,2014-07-04,"I'm so frustrated with this place.  We've had extremely polarizing experiences here, but at the end of the day the issue is with the staff.  The management seems to need a complete overhaul and while some of the waitstaff is excellent, they seem to be constantly struggling.  My Family ate here on a thursday night about 3 weeks ago- It took us 2 hours to get through service without alcoholic beverages or appetizers. We waited *Forever* for our food and our waiter was so busy, he had no time to be apologetic.  We attempted to use the app for bill pay but something happened and we ended up waiting another 20 minutes for a bill.  Also, they screwed up 2 of the three orders.  The food was not bad, but the service was so deplorable that I said we would never go back.  Yesterday, at 3:00 however, my daughter *HAD* to have a pizookie, and since it was 3:00 on a thursday I figured they couldn't possibly be busy.  We were seated immediately- not welcomed, just how many and right this way. We took our seat, and about 10 minutes later (this is too long) a young man came to the table and told us that our waitress Stephanie was busy and he was helping her. We ordered our drinks and appetizers.  The drinks came almost immediately, the appetizer did not.  We sat and watched a group of staff next to the bar and a man in a blue button down and a tie have a fairly jovial conversation, and we continued to wait.  The Young man then came back telling us that Stephanie was still our waitress, however he was going to go ahead and take our orders (at that point isn't he our waiter?) we ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food.  All said and done the meal took about an hour- which is fine, but I feel like a restaurant like this should have service down better.  This is where I really started to struggle, my child was tired of sitting and rolling around in the booth. I couldn't find the young man and I had seen a young woman with HUGE eyelashes one time (Maybe he was stephanie? if she was she didn't introduce herself?) She didn't want the pizookie anymore, but if she had we wouldn't have been able to order it because we SAT FROM 4 to ALMOST 430 WITH NO SERVICE. NOT EVEN A HOW WAS YOUR MEAL OR CAN WE CLEAR YOUR PLATES.  I FINALLY grabbed a young woman who was not our waitress and demanded our check, at which point she walked over to the man in the long sleeve blue shirt who brought our check and gave me the LEAST sincere apology I have ever experienced.  He told me he would take care of our check, I handed him cash and he walked away.  HE HANDED IT TO THE WAITRESS. HE DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO RING IT OUT KNOWING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY.  Apparently his time is more valuable standing next to the bar and chatting with the staff.   This is my perceived experience, but any business owner should understand that to your customer perception is reality and in my humble opinion you have a huge attitude and staffing issue and those problems clearly start with your management.  You should take a lesson from the BJs in cupertino I've been there on a number of occasions and never once had an issue with the service.  This is disappointing since we live in Irvine, fairly close.  I will never eat here again and every time anyone brings up BJs this will be the story I tell them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=460,2.8,2.89,3.004,2.472,2.854

332,Walter M.,"Oceanside, CA",1865,1608,606.0,3.0,2014-07-10,"Some companies get it and others don't. Some things are convenient and others not so much. As many of you know BJ's can be hit or miss in terms of wait/service. Case in point. I've literally come during a rush and been told 30 minute wait, driven to another BJ's 30 miles away and been seated and eating before my friends who I left there was. That's the kind of massive discrepancies you'll find at some BJ's. It's very area and time dependent. As an early adopter I'm all over online ordering, mobile apps and of course rewards programs. Chipotle gets it, easy, fast, quick to navigate, accurate, convenient. BJ's online ordering is the exact opposite. Their large menu is not intuitive, it's not fast, it's accurate, but when you pull up into curb side and call in, maybe they pick up, maybe they don't. Maybe the ticket on your foot says 21 minutes before pick up and maybe your food comes out 14 minutes late. Maybe you eventually come inside and see the dining room pretty empty. Who knows. I haven't and certainly don't have the time to track and document the rushes here, but I can tell you if you want to get back to work in a reasonable hour and think that curbside or ordering ahead will work. It will not. As with most BJ's the food is solid. You can't really complain as their menu selection is good and they have solid items and great beer pairings. It's not a sports bar despite their full bar and TV's and dark wood. It's not the cheesecake factory with their way too big a menu and lack of more salt of the earth items. My go to items are the avocado egg rolls and santa fe spring rolls, balance, bold and I like the avo cream sauce for both, when fresh are excellent appetizers, seared ahi tuna salad and a cocktail or craft beer. Don't expect too much local, but I'm a fan of their Tatonka stout. They have a very middle eastern seaboard brewing style across their in house offerings. Love the craft root beer, but too bad it's not free refills. Nothing is overly hopped (except Hopstorm), seasoned, roasted or IBU'd so it's a basic, but full offering. Service is ok, it's pretty good when you come here late or early, but in between, forget about it. Staff is very polite and usually apologetic so I generally sit at the bar for faster more attentive service. Classic dark wood, wall window ambiance. I dig the gluten free menu options and the small bites offerings. Spinach stuffed mushrooms have tons of flavor packed in single bite sized eats. Baked, not fried. Fried artichoke hearts with just lemon are just fine, no need for aioli aka mayonnaise. Don't get the mac and cheese, it's a kinds of failure. Something about the mixture of meats and cheese for a deep dish really separates the supreme pepperoni from the  veggie options. The classic is ideal for the sausage. It's maybe kinda close to the style they do in Chicago, but very corporatized. Burgers are ok, tons of fries, but it ain't no red robin, they need work. Higher heat, better meat mixture, the burgers are well put together. I prefer the pork chops over the steaks because honestly if it aint prime steak it's not worthy. The pork chops are almost never dry and it's a hearty meal. Spaghetti and meat sauce are pretty solid a backup when carb loading. Appetizers are pretty large in general and shareable which is why the small bites are so good for those who eat alone. Pizookie is excellent, even to go. A must try is the salted caramel with the extra caramel sauce. Literally this 1 item is the saving grace to an otherwise mediocre restaurant. I'll keep coming back for that alone, love the 3 pack, but a variety sampler of all would be great, sure you can do it on your own, but ordering is a pain online like this.

She forgot to place a food order for one guest all together which was delivered to the table after everyone else finished eating. She ignored multiple requests for drinks and water, then tried to make a joke and brought three waters to the one guest all at one time. This server took a desert order, forgot, again, and  asked if we wanted desert a second time describing the deserts, once morel until we reminded her that she had already taken the order.

We frequent the restaurant and being that it's a favorite of most everyone in our family it's always an easy option. This being said our last visit to the Irvine location was anything but satisfactory. In fact it was downright rude, the service lacked but the food was enjoyable. Giving the benefit of the doubt to maybe the servers we had come in contact with were just having a bad day we didn't complain. It's understandably human nature to have an off day.   However, this is what set me over the edge refusing to go back to this location. Our family consist of three children. Needless to say we went to the bathroom a few times, one two wash before eating, once to take my younger daughter, then again my oldest daughter accompanied my son near the end of our meal. That last trip took longer than expected so excused myself to go check on the two leaving my husband and younger daughter at the table. Upon my return my husband says that he very distinctively heard a server at the station near us say, ""watch them"". Excuse me, I was appalled. Our family is not the type to cause a big stink so we paid and quietly left.  I will not be returning to this Bj's to be treated second rate for whatever reasons we were on this day. Our family really enjoys Bj's and have never received this sort of service at the two Huntington locations, Brea nor Orange. I would rather drive further to enjoy a meal peacefully. It's so very sad in this day and age that this sort of stereo typing is still occurring.

DELICIOUS highly recommend because the crust is delicious and everything else tastes so yummy on this!!! -Pizookie ($5.95): it was okay but i dont think these are worth the hype. i do prefer the chocolate flavor over the others and i mean if you are going to try this then get the chocolate flavor -Classic Burger ($8.95): thought i could not go wrong with a simple, basic burger but i had a weird tasting burger. the meat was flavored very strange and overall was not good... DONT GET IT -Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce ($9.95): TERRIBLE! im a sucker for basic marinara sauce pastas and this was the worst!! im not sure if its the sauce or just idk it was not good... DONT GET! -Happy Hour Sliders ($5): simple, delicious, and lives up to the standard slider. for five bucks you get three (i believe) simple sliders with cheese and a side of fries to go with it. i would get this again! overall.... if you crave BJs then go here but i prefer to head to different chain restaurants unless its for the happy hour or pizzas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=300,2.76,2.92,2.996,2.6640000000000006,2.856

It's definitely hit or miss and not always consistent. However, tonight I was extremely disappointed. I placed a pick up order at 12am at this location on a Saturday night. The man who took my order seemed winded but still very friendly considering the time of night. I usually try and avoid ordering from places shortly before they close but tonight I got off work late and I was exhausted, suffering from sciatica and not in the mood to cook. I work in food service so I mostly understand what goes through the kitchen staffs mind when they see an order placed an hour before closing which is why I kept it simple. Mini deep dish cheese and tomato only. My usual. My boyfriend picked it up for me and when I opened the box, there was a black film under the cheese that was caked onto the top of the pizza bread. This has happened before and always late night. I had previously assumed it was just burnt cheese but considering this only happens late night, I was irritated. All I wanted was my pizza. I was starving so I still ate it but I had to peel back the cheese and peel off the film. I get it, it's late and the staff wants to get all their pre-closing done but come on! If this film on my pizza is a result of just wanting to get out on time I'm really disappointed in the way management runs the kitchen.

278,Geeyoung L.,"Irvine, CA",60,243,451.0,3.0,2014-09-05,"I came with a party of 7 for lunch on a Friday. We ordered 3 of the 2 for $22 special which includes 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza, and 1 pizookie.  We got the lobster bisque, caesar salad, and clam chowder soups. The lobster bisque did not taste very good, and was definitely not a favorite to any of us. The caesar salad had pieces of brown lettuce all over in it, and it was drenched in salty caesar dressing. We were pretty disgusted at the lettuce. The clam chowder soup was the best out of the three, but it was very salty.  For the pizza, we got the Great White, BBQ Pizza, and half Buffalo/ half BJ's Favorite. The Great White pizza was very bland, I couldn't taste the alfredo sauce at all. Most of us didn't really like the Great White pizza and were disappointed. The BBQ pizza was very bland as well. The flavors were dull. The BJ's Favorite tasted just like a combination pizza from any place. The buffalo pizza was probably our favorite out of the four, although it was very salty. It was somewhat spicy, and had a ton of celery on top.  After, we got 3 pizookies - the peanut butter, cookies and cream, and salty caramel. I asked for the peanut butter smores pizookie, but the waitress brought out the peanut butter one, so I just kept it.  The best part of the meals were definitely the pizookies. Although they're really sweet, they were tasty.  The service of this place was horrible. We constantly asked them for water, more coffee, etc. but they did not come back for the longest time, forgetting what we asked for. It was pretty frustrating trying to get them to bring what we asked for since they kept forgetting. I let them go for bringing the wrong pizookie out, but this just shows how uncaring the waiters were.

210,Cindy Y.,"Boston, MA",577,333,878.0,4.0,2014-09-05,"When you walk into BJ's, you are greeted with absolutely beautiful decorations, with huge TV's mounted high up on the walls and that intimate ambiance. It's definitely a great place if you just want some drinks, dessert, or a nice dinner. Service is great and food arrives pretty promptly, despite the fact that they are so busy! I came here several times, mostly for pizookies, once for brunch, and several times for dinners. While most things are ""A-OK,"" what I definitely recommend are the pizookies and the pizzas! PIZOOKIES: they have a ton! There is a new one (salted caramel), white chocolate macadamian nut, cookies and cream, triple chocolate, smores, and the classic chocolate chip (also available gluten-free). Out of those ones, my favorite has got to be the white chocolate macadamian. It's actually the least sweet among all of them, and that works well, in my opinion. Since this is practically ice cream and cookie, you're going to get a lot of sweetness. When the cookie isn't too sweet, it provides just the right amount of chewy, yet delicious, goodness that melts your ice cream and delivers heaven to your taste buds. The macadamian nut is amazing, because you get white chocolate bits and macadamian nuts as you bite into it. Provides a nice crunch that is great! PIZZAS: what's special is that their crust is thick. They do it well. The crust is thick, yet so soft but crispy on the outside. It tastes absolutely amazing. My family and I got the White Pizza, which was great. The alfredo sauce really gave the pizza a nice creamy flavor that paired well with the tomatoes on it. The mushrooms were also absolutely tasty. I had a hard time trying to stop myself from finishing all of it so my family could have some. Overall, come here for the pizookies and pizzas! Haven't tried their drinks, but they look great. We also got the pastas, which weren't that great. Not much flavor to them, although the shrimp scampi definitely wins out over the chicken pasta.

I've had the pizza and its not bad but not something I'd crave. This time I decided to try the Honey lime Scallops and unfortunately couldn't find anything positive about it.  Scallops were seared to the point they looked a bit burnt. Rice was bland. The asparagus were just old and chewy. After combining the sauce with the rice, it was more flavorful but the sauce was too peppery. To top it off, my strawberry lemonade was too sour and my free salted caramel pizookie (free if you sign up to their rewards) was toooo sweet. The ice cream was ok but the cookie portion was packed with sugar (and I have a sweet tooth too!!!)

306,Nick K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",42,32,8.0,4.0,2014-09-10,"Have a craving for unique high quality pizza?  Then this is your next place to visit! From the wide variety of pizza topings available to the great low-key atmosphere, BJ's has it all. Plus, there beer selection is definitely worth trying out! They have some great brews for a fairly reasonable price. OF course let us not forget the best part about BJ's: Their Pizookie! This is an incredible taste of freshly baked cookie with cool ice cream on top.  It really is difficult to select a favorite at BJ's, either the pizza or pizookie! The price is pretty reasonable and a great place to catch up with friends. The food quality is always exceptional and I do enjoy their wide variety of food options available. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is relaxing. They have very comfortable booths for seating as well as several TV's for people to catch the local sports game and a full service bar.  The only downside to BJ's is the service. I have been to BJ's for several years and always loved and enjoyed the food and quality of it but the service was nothing more than average- especially if you have a large party, more times than not the service will be slow and take a while to fill requests.

We were on a time crunch and picking something we knew was the best option for the night. There was a bit of a wait - 15 minutes, but we were seated in about 10. We let the waitress know that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she was extremely accommodating of it. She took our order right away and had the food out quickly. She even got us our bill right after she confirmed that our food was to our liking.  We had a great patio seat with lots of fans over head for the little bit of heat that was still sticking to the day before the sun completely set. The place was busy, but everyone was on their game and seemed to be handling the rush with ease and experience.  My honey chicken salad was amazingly fresh and delicious.

The food is consistent with all other BJ's so I won't spend too much time reviewing the food.  I will note though, that 2 out of 3 visits here (when I actually ordered food instead of just getting drinks at the bar) I had some sort of misfortune.  First time (back when they still had the marina meatballs) they forgot to order it so it took 45 minutes for it to come out.  Second time the bartenders were changing shifts and forgot to order our spinach and artichoke dip so the new bartender had to re-order it for us.  On that same visit, there was hair in our pizza between the cheese and the sauce.  Granted, they took care of the spinach artichoke dip for us, but no love for the hair in our pizza?  Just a ""sorry about that.""  I wouldn't expect to them to take care of it since we ate most of the pizza before finding the hair, but at least a more genuine or sincere apology would've sufficed.

Why am I rating them a 2 stars?  First of all the greeters at the front desk - anything but friendly.  I wish I got their names....but they were 2 younger girls.  I hope they don't have aspirations to be much more in life  than where they are sitting - because their attitudes sucked!  They had sour faces when we came in.  All they did was take our name and hand us a buzzer - they are not even the ones to seat people!   I asked if we could sit outside at the patio - one of them said ""yes - if i can find a server for out there.""  Not sure what that meant..... because people were seated out there already.  We searched the bar area, but it was packed due to all the sports events that were taking place...... our name was called in about 10 minutes.  The greeter now informs me that she cant seat us at the patio because a party of 17 will be seated out there (yeah we get it - more $$ - whatever) and she cant accomodate us.   The seater now takes us to our table....which is near a busy walk path and UNDER NEATH the TV screen.   I told her we didnt want this table - the whole purpose was to SEE the TV while we dined.   She said ""i'm sorry.  Are you sure you dont want this table?  I will have to give it to someone else"".    I said ""No, I don't want it and secondly, dont say you are sorry, when I know darn well you could care less where you seat us."" We ended up fending for ourselves and grabbing a table in the bar area....barely.    The first waitress we had in the bar brought us our menus....didnt get her name though... when my boyfriend inquired about a specific kind of beer....she says ""all our beers are listed in our menu.""  - which is fine, we didn't expect her to list the names of everything on the menu - but it was the ATTITUDE and TONE that was conveyed.   if i could guess what she was thinking, it felt something like ""read the menu idiots, I don't have time for this.""  The next thing we knew - SHE wasn't our waitress anymore and our new server took care of us, which was fine.    She was the only person that was upbeat and positive and acted like she CARED. I don't mean to seem trivial and I am not a high maintenance customer - it really all boils down to the ATTITUDE that one person after the next  at this location conveyed while interacting with customers.   These were all primarly the Greeters and Seaters.   If they aren't friendly - who wants to continue with eating there?

I asked for a manager on duty and asked 1) if we could be relocated( answer was no because he told me that we will need to wait another 30+ minutes) and 2) if he could talk to the big party to turn down the volume little.  The manager keeps telling me that the large party will calm down as soon as Bizooki(sp?)  comes out.  He never said we will try to make the situation better or we will give you free customer service item, such as additional discount or dessert.  The manager did not know how to handle this kind of situation well.  How can he call himself a manager???

And they never even offered a discount or comp anything on the receipt after their error.  The deep dish pizza we ordered was horrible. I swear there wasn't any pizza sauce on that 'pizza' or maybe it got evaporated from over cooking it and bringing it to me burnt. Really? You see a burnt pizza and think 'I bet they will love this'.?!??  You would think this place would be good for kids... But it is not. The waitstaff gave us dirty looks as they passed by our table and saw our toddler throwing it's nasty mac & cheese (that we bought for six dollars) all over the floor! I don't blame him for throwing the food... I wanted to do the same with mine! I guess it boils down to this... There are so many options around this location to choose from... If you want your restaurant to succeed, you need good customer service, and the two times I've been there, the waitstaff is horrible and the food is inconsistent.

So if Olive Garden is your idea of a fancy Italian dinner then BJ's is the place for you! This review is only based on the food as the service I usually receive here is decent or good.

730,DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4.0,1.0,2015-01-22,"Just got take out, order number 319153. I ordered a small classic combo pizza(sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms) and specifically entered a special request online for pizza to be well done and a small salad with Italian dressing(w/ carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and croutons). Picked it up at take out counter and cashier confirmed my order, I agreed and he politely put it in a take out bag. I had to ask for a fork, napkins and Parmesan cheese packets. Isn't it just good service if he asked if I needed any of these instead of just handing me a bag and a receipt? Manager problem. Well, stupid me for trusting the cook and the cashier and not checking my order before I got home. I open up my salad and there are no carrots, tomatoes or cucumbers and very little lettuce. Oh well, I think, I'm hungry so I just ate it. Then, I open up my pizza and notice that half the pizza is just cheese, there is only one slice of pepperoni on the entire pizza with a few small mushroom slices and a few pieces of sausage on half of the pizza and it was not crispy nor cooked well done as I requested. Again, stupid me for trusting their competence and that they actually care about quality and a positive customer experience. Again, a Manager problem. So, I call BJs in Irvine and speak to a Manager named Chuck to reiterate my frustration and dissatisfaction as described above. Chuck immediately goes into his trained managerial corporate lingo and actually says,""Sounds like you got the wrong pizza."" Really Chuck? Monday night at 8:30pm? Really? How bout this Chuck? How bout you and the other corporate bean counter managers get out of your office and get your eyes on your kitchen and wait staff to confirm service and quality are consistently being delivered? Just a bunch of sense of entitlement HS and College kids who work here with no work ethic, not a clue on what customer service means, it's just a playtime workplace. And, really no difference in the Manager's competence. So, keep counting your beans, watch your sales and stock price continue to drop and try to figure why your customers are not returning. You won't, instead you'll just find a way to decrease the portions and quality and increase your prices. I'm done. Never again! America, Stay with your local owner operated businesses.

Only grip is that the service is kind of slow, and the wait can be long.  I used to always get the Steak Salad, but I'm sad to say that I don't think they have this anymore. So the last time I was here, I tried something new - the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon (see picture) over a bed of fluffy Israeli couscous, spinach and asparagus. I found this under the Enlightened section of the menu, so I expected something small and light since it was boasting a low calorie count. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the portion was. I could barely finish it! And I was delighted to find the dish to be VERY delicious and flavorful. I was ""mmm""ing at every bite, and baffled at how this could only be only 590 calories. Seasons 52 better watch out! I liked this salmon A WHOLE lot more than Seasons 52's low-calorie salmon dish (and needless to say, Season's 52 is also a lot more expensive, and the portion is smaller). I think I've found my go-to, guilt-free dish here... Also, I usually get beer, but this time I decided to try the Sparkling Raspberry Lemonade Mocktail (see pic). This was a tad too sweet, but still good. $3.50 felt especially worth it because of the unlimited refills. Next time I'll probably get another Mocktail instead of beer.  All in all, 4 stars.

If you love Belgians, this may be the go-to spot you hate to admit going to, but the list is pretty legit. My brother is a fan of Belgian beers with Chimay Blue at the top of his list, but he often ventures into sours, trippels, dubbels, and IPAs. And believe it or not, BJs is also one of his favorite places for beers.  We decided to grab dinner and some beers. He got his Chimay Blue and I tried something new, a sour! I had Supplication recently and although I liked it, it was much more tart than I expected. Petrus Oud Bruin is a wonderful introduction to sours as the dark, caramel brown ale has a slight sour tang without being overwhelming. I totally dig sours now! Can't wait to try more :) For dinner, I wasn't very hungry, so I just got the usual bar fare and a salad. I rarely eat salad as a meal, but roasted beets has been a favorite recently. This one was superb and only $4! It's in the healthy section lol. Dried cranberries, sweet yellow beets, strawberry balsamic vinaigrette and arugula - I would love to have this again. And then I ordered wings. Theirs is drizzled with a buffalo ranch, but it's pretty sparse so it doesn't sog up the crunchy wings.  Bro got a burger sandwich or something with their famous potatoes wedges. It's a must have for him, the potato wedges haha.

Possible Suggestion for Management -maybe consider better weekday sun pm - thur pms happy hour prices and times.... You have tapas the new brewery coming and they will give you a run for the money if you don't do something to lower the wait times and your rewards program needs to lower their limits and or should include total bill price towards rewards.  Also your front doors should be adjusted to open easier for all guest.

The spinach and artichoke dip was really good.  My only complaint is that they could've added more spinach to the dip and if it wasn't so runny.  The dip was really thin and I prefer my dips to be thicker.  Once we were done with the dip, my boyfriend asked our waitress for some salsa which she brought out for us with no problems or extra cost!  Great way to eat up all those left over chips hehe. The Spicy Hawaiian pizza was also pretty good.  I don't know what it was missing but it wasn't as delicious as we had imagined it to be.  I did like how the pineapples added some sweetness to the pizza while the jalepenos added spice.  It was a good twist of flavors but something was missing.  Maybe use ham or bacon instead of chicken?  I did like how thick the cheese was... you could literally pull and pull at it before it'd break apart.  The Balsamic chicken entree is one of my boyfriends favorite plates to get here.  We got it upon his request.  The chicken was tender and not dry at all.  The mashed potatoes was seasoned very well and I like how they added onion strings on top.  Everything just paired very well with each other and it's actually a pretty generous amount of food.   This place can get busy and happy hour is ONLY at the bar :/  Kind of a bummer because I hate waiting around at the bar for a table and I would rather eat my meals elsewhere.  I hope they change that in the near future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=100,3.0,2.88,2.892,2.7039999999999997,2.9280000000000004

My personal favorite is the raspberry lemon drop martini. And of course you have to get the pizzookie to top it all off (if you're not stuffed to the brim).

155,Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2017,776,2655.0,4.0,2015-05-14,"I always thought BJ's had good food, but what stops me from frequenting here is the wait time.  It takes a good 5-10 minutes for a waiter to take your drink order, then another 15-20 minutes for your food to come out.  If it's a busy night, you may have to wait a while just to be seated.  At this location at the Tustin/Irvine Marketplace, it gets busy quickly.   I love that BJ's has a huge menu: appetizers, entrees, salads/soups, desserts.  On top of that, their drink selection is pretty impressive.  Sometimes it doesn't help if you are indecisive..everything on the menu will start to sound awesome and you order too much food!  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushroom, although they added more items on their appetizer menu like the flatbread and carnitas fries.  My favorite entrees here include burgers and pizza.  I love their deep-dish pizza - so many great choices like Great White, Sweet Pig, and BBQ Chicken.  My fave salads include Thai Chicken Mango and Santa Fe (I love avocado!).  For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the famous pizookie.  Their newest on the menu is the smores peanut butter.  (Note: you cannot get this one in a mini/birthday size)  I tried red velvet, triple chocolate, and salted caramel, and I still prefer cookies and cream.  The previous three are VERY sweet. HAPPY HOUR: Mon-Fri 3p-7p and Sun-Thur 10p-close.  (Yes, they close late: midnight!) Their happy hour doesn't really work for me, but $5 martinis!  For this location's happy hour menu, see their website here:  The reason they get four stars is I received excellent customer service from Craig.  He was great with checking on our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed.  That particular visit I had an email coupon, and he had already applied it when he brought the check.  This really impressed me because most times the waiter makes me wait another 20 minutes to correct the bill with their manager (sometimes it still comes out wrong), especially on my trips to BJ's.

My friends were already seated and had a drink/food order placed before I got there (I was just joining them for a drink), the server came back around once I was seated and asked my friends how they were doing without even acknowledging a new person was at the table and I was sitting closest to the edge with no drink and an open menu (clue that maybe I want to order??) Well she started to walk away still without even acknowledging me! I had to flag her down and let her know I wanted to order, I understand she had a lot of tables but she didn't even let me speak before trying to walk away. Also once she walked away my friends mentioned she had quite the attitude which was very apparent! She had the attitude of she did not want to be working and was not trying to make our experience enjoyable. Before we were ready to leave we mentioned it to some woman who was walking around to tables (she was a fill in manager or from another location - cant remember exactly) and her solution was to offer us free dessert, which granted that was nice but we had said we were full and would pass, well she came around two more times trying to get us to take the free dessert! After multiple times of telling her no she finally brought the check and said she was sorry for our bad experience and that they had sent the server home (which they did - we saw her out in the parking lot). We were surprised she didn't comp anything off the bill as we didn't take the dessert.

The extensive menu seems to cater more to quantity rather than quality and while the portions are large, I have not been impressed by the actual taste of my food. The drinks are the same way. When paying for a $12.00 drink, you would expect to be served a drink that contains some measurable amount of alcohol. The drinks I have ordered tasted weak and were far overpriced considering their quality. The service also seems to take longer to deliver drinks to the table than food. During my last visit to BJs, my table had to wait over twenty minutes to be served our first round of drinks. Considering a few in my party ordered bottled beer, this wait time seems ridiculous.

The avocado egg rolls were bomb though and so was the appetizer platter but I felt it was a little too pricey for what it was, some mozzarella sticks, egg rolls, chips & dip and youre tryna charge me $17? bruh. But anyways, I ordered the cajun pasta which had a really good flavor to it. My only real complaint would be that a lot of the noodles were stuck together as if it'd been sitting for awhile or maybe not cooked properly?

207,Azzy O.,"Orange, CA",157,106,17.0,2.0,2015-10-03,"I decided to not pay anymore patronage to the location at The Block due to horrible customer service and give this location a try after so many years.  First off, at 3:00PM it was very empty. There were booths available for at least 4 other groups of parties if needed. We were a party of 5 and a child and the hostess put us at a table w 4 chairs and where was my 2 yrs old to sit, on my lap? I asked for a booth so she won't fall or even get a highchair and she said she couldn't because there were so many reservations. As long as I remembered, there were only reservations a day ahead for parties of 8 or more. So I had to ask and she did confirm that you only need if there were parties of 8 or more and that's why we couldn't sit there. After we sat, she sat a bunch of parties of 2 or 3 people per empty booth. Why didn't her excuse as to why we couldn't get bigger table applied to them?  My point was that it's not about table or booth, it's about how she was seating other 2 or 3 people that had no reservations where she could easily sat us with a child. This is not our choice of place to eat but where my daughter loves the pizza so it's the initial reason why we are here. I also let one of the manager know and he truly apologized how she handled us.  Tip to hostess, when you see a child (offer highchair), someone disabled or elderly... try to make their visit comfortable. It's not difficult because it was pretty empty at the time. There are plenty of other places to eat nearby. I was just trying to make my child happy on her birthday for her favorite pizza and pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=200,3.4,3.02,2.972,2.408,3.1720000000000006

They are also famous for their pizookie desserts.  It's a mini-pizza pan, but filled with cookie and topped with ice cream.  I would definitely try this, it's good to share and it's really tasty and well cooked. Service was really nice and we were even alerted of happy hour deals when we didn't know it was even happy hour time!  Happy with the portions and taste of most items, the deep dish pizza could improve, but I still like the experience you get at a BJ's.  Their craft beers are great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=80,3.36,2.99,2.976,2.6399999999999997,3.138

It took a while just to get sides of sauces we asked for in the first place and had to remind him. But this wasn't what really upset us. Upon paying the bill we were 62 cents short (I held the tip for later) so my friend put in a dollar then I put in the tip money ($16) and he kept it all without giving us any change. We would have given it to him anyway but we saw him shove the money in his back pocket.

Again, this is a complaint on their customer service. This complaint is about our service on October 17th, 2015, and it began at 6pm. My husband, 8-month old son, and I arrived at 6pm to meet up with my parents and brother. I told the hostess that there was a reservation at 6pm under my father's name; instead of checking to see if they were already seated, the hostess said, ""I'm not sure if they're here, but feel free to walk around and see if they are."" What?! You can't check to see if they're here?! I'M the one who's supposed to do YOUR job? Ridiculous! As it turns out, my family had not yet arrived at that point; but after they did arrive, the seating hostess sat us at the BUSIEST aisle, knowing that we had a child that required a high-chair (that had to be placed in this very busy aisle, which was by the kitchen). My son's chair was pushed as far in as possible (so that he wasn't in the way), and a bus boy STILL came rushing around the corner and collided into my son. My son got startled and started crying, of course, but I was glad that nothing had spilt on him (like hot food or a stack of plates). Right afterwards, a man named Chuck (I'm guessing he was the manager/supervisor) came up to our table and asked us if everything was okay. We told him that, for the future, it would be best not to seat parties with a child requiring a high chair in the busiest aisle of the restaurant. He apologized and asked if he could get us anything; since we were still eating our dinner, we said we were okay at the moment. We were going to stay for dessert, but everyone was upset about the service that we decided to get dessert somewhere else. When we got the check, we were shocked that we weren't comp'ed for a meal or given a discount. I was so upset that I just wanted to get the hell out of there. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! You're so lucky that my 8-month old kid didn't get hurt! I'm not so angry with the bus boy as I am with the hostess and manager. The bus boy was very apologetic, and I can tell he was very remorseful.

223,Richard J.,"South El Monte, CA",0,18,6.0,3.0,2016-01-18,"There are a few things that come to mind when thinking of a great place to dine.. One is obviously the food, this place has it.  Variety, mid-range meals, bargain meals and beer!  The other things are ambience/environment which it has a bit of as well.  The last thing is customer service/experience.  That is where this location falls short.   I've been a customer of several BJ's restaurant and this one for quite some time since I work nearby.  The wait staff is usually chipper but I always seem to get stuck with someone who isn't very nice.  I have a high tolerance for issue and not complaining because I'm considerate to things that may be out of their control but bad service is just that.. bad service.  My recent experience there was on a Monday night for the College Football Championship.  I arrived shortly after 5pm and grabbed an open booth at the bar, good enough to see multiple TVs and enough privacy for personal conversation.  Our waitress was a very good looking gal who seemed like she was in a rush when greeting me at the table.  I had obviously just sat down and without hesitation she asked me if I knew what I wanted to order.  I get that she may have asked for my drink order but I felt it odd that she asked if I wanted to order food without giving me a second to look at the menu.  I know I've been here multiple times but it was how she said it.  I then began to feel like she was rushing me because she knew that I was going to watch the game and most likely, she didn't feel that I would be ordering throughout the game, which I did do.   I was waiting for a friend so I was very patient when ordering my food/drinks in anticipation that my guest would be a few minutes behind.  Nonetheless, I ordered some wings, a personal pizza and a beer.  As my guest arrived he asked for menu and he simply did not get one.  After we both finished our drinks, she comes back and asks if he was ready to order.  similar to my experience, he felt rushed because she had not even left the menu the first time nor did she bring my water that I asked for several times.   All that to say, during the start of the 4th quarter of the game I was about to order a final beer when the waitress came over and said that she would be leaving for the day and before she was going to introduce us to our new waiter, she wanted to close out the tab/check.   Not knowing what to say, we agreed to close it out.  I know this was done because she wanted to cash out on the tip which she did deserve but that was definitely awkward and unprofessional in my opinion.  I ended up making a mistake about the tip and I over tipped because it was a split bill.  Just a disaster of an experience.  I'm sure that doesn't speak for the entire staff however, this isn't the first time I've been to this location and the service wasn't great.   BJ's I still love your chicken wings, don't hate me for my feedback ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=240,3.04,3.05,2.92,2.444,3.046

Without any customers in the entry area both hostesses were standing around. We asked for a booth near the bar, but we simply got a point in the general area, so my colleague and I went on a search.  The seating at the bar area was very limited and not conducive of a business dinner. We went back to the hostess and found a small crowd now. We were asked to sign in and had to wait several minutes for a table. I felt as if we should have just been given a table to begin with. Our waitress was very rushed and eager to get away from our table. She actually walked off ad my colleague attempted to order an appetizer. Our appetizers came out a short while later and we're great.  Our waitress eventually surfaced again for a fly by ""you guys doing ok?"" She was already gone before we could respond and tell her we wanted to place an order. After we flagged her down we placed our orders. I was unhappy to find that the pork chops I have come to love are no longer on the menu. I decided to order the fish and chips. BJ'S has always had good everything so I was sorely disappointed when my fish was the worst I have ever had. The bottom of the dish had a pool of grease that the fish was sitting in. It left the batter greasy and soggy. There was so much greasy batter that I eventually had to peel it off to get to the fish.

This visit to the BJ's in Irvine was very very disappointing, especially when I was here to have my good friend celebrate his birthday. It was all good until our food order was placed by our not so happy waitress. Usually BJ's waitress / waiter are super friendly and smiles a lot however this time she wasn't. We placed our drink order, 4 appetizer, and our 2 large entrees with 2 sides. We waited for a little bit of time and we got one of our side dishes the tomato capree salad first to share as an appetizer. After we waited for quite a bit of time ALL OF OUR FOOD came out at once which includes  all 4 large appetizer, 2 large entree dishes, including full rack of ribs with fries. Immediately I was very surprised how all of these came out at once. I am betting someone forgot to bring out our appetizer as all of the appetizer were cold. We had the calamari which seems it was friend twice and was not hot from the fryer. We ordered another round of drinks but it never came. So we asked for it again and still nothing.!!  The buffalo wings were cold like it's been sitting out for about 20-30min. Our California Club flat bread pizza was also cold where the cheese already started to harden. The full rack of ribs was cold and the outside skin was burnt where you taste more of the burnt skin and heavy BBQ sauce.  We were hungry and I was embarrassed to even tell my friend this a great restaurant where I often visit frequently. None the less we ate as much as we can bare. After we finished most of the food, we told the waiter it was our friends birthday so we got a free mini boozkie. This requires some time to make but NO ONE EVEN bothered to take our finished plates away. We sat there and chatted for over an hour and when the desert came our mini table was still filled with used dishes. The waiter didn't even bother to help clean up the table so we stacked 3 piles of plates. While the candle on the ice cream was melting. The waiter came back and took 2 of the pile and left the biggest pile of large plates on our table. He never came back for it, no one wished my friend a Happy Birthday, and we had to take pictures with piles of empty plates on our table. I wanted to say something but no attention was given to us. We dined for about 2 1/2 hour and I wanted to get my check but my waitress was no where to be found. Being the tech guy I am I paid over the BJ's APP and continue to sit and chat for another 30min. No one thanked us.  Honestly I am very disappointed with the service here, the quality of food is terrible and i'm questioning the temperature of the food to even meet health code standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=360,3.08,3.09,2.948,2.212,3.086

I remember when my sister first started taking us there in the HB location and I thought it was the cats meow! I still feel that way especially since their menu is forever changing and evolving! Sometimes we'd have lunch at the HB location while in the area getting our nails done but now that she's moved to Irvine and we've moved out of state things are so different now :( I was in town for 2 days to see my sister and we came here on our last night and I couldn't believe how packed it was for a Wednesday night! OMG! Just about every table was filled and bigger parties were coming in by the droves! Luckily my sister walks extremely fast and was able to snag a table in the bar area LOL!  In the beginning the service was spotty, it took quite a bit to get menus and water, our server was slammed and was constantly on the go so I can only be upset at management not her because their wasn't enough employees. Once she was able to get us menus and drinks, we started with appetizers! Coming to BJ's is the best place for appetizers! They have so many to choose from, some to eat by yourself, some to share with your pals!  We started with: -Bone in chicken wings (we like ours with sauce on the side so we can enjoy the wing on its own and dunk our own sauces on it) Their wings are always on point, I've never had a bad order of wings, their always crispy and never soggy! -Potstickers: These are my go to! I wish they gave you more! We can easily sniff these up! Their always delicious and the dipping sauce is great too!  -Cup of clam chowder: The chowder is nice and creamy, not too watered down, I wish it had more potatoes but other than this is a solid choice everytime! Down to the entrées LOL My mom and sister both went for burgers and I tried one of their new Piadianas and was kind of disappointed :/ In the picture they look super ooey gooey and cheesy! However without any kind of sauce it is really dry, and the cheese was melted properly so it was kind of thick and coagulated :/  Other than that everything else was just delicious! Service got better throughout the night and my sister took home a Cookies and Cream Pizookie! I was too full and sleepy to try it but she said it was delicious!

38,Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4734,412,1621.0,4.0,2016-04-03,"I haven't been to a BJ's in maybe 10 years or longer.  My initial impression when I visited the Irvine location today was that nothing much has changed.  I was actually quite surprised by the lack of technology at the reception area. They don't use any form of pagers.  They don't ask for your phone number or text you when your table is ready.  Instead, the hostesses will scream your name at the top of her lungs in the noisy lobby when your table is ready.  Just like the way they do it in those traditional Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. However, the menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I was at a BJ's. It was definitely more extensive, and more contemporary and creative. We ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Classic flatbread which was topped with pepperonis, Italian sausages, and fresh mushrooms.  The potions of the toppings were very generous.  The cheese was what they call BJ's 5-cheese blend and it was very tasty, with a rich flavor of mozzarella, which I like.  The sauce was light, slightly tangy and sweet.  The crust was baked to almost perfection. We also ordered an Asian chopped salad and we were impressed that we were able to custom order it without green onions and cilantro.  (CPK on the other side of the Market Place would not and could not do it because their salads were pre-mixed).  BJ's is certainly a winner here and beat CPK by a TKO! The salad was made with a wide variety of baby greens, romaine lettuce, napa cabbage, shredded carrot, mandarin orange slices, among other goodies.  All the veggies tasted very fresh.  The thick slices of grilled chicken breast meat that came with the salad were yummy and tender.  The final magic touch was the delicious honey ginger dressing which sealed the deal of making it an amazing salad. Service has been friendly and efficient throughout our meal.  The mostly 70's or 80's classic rock vibes are cool.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and quite a pleasant surprise.  Will definitely be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40,2.84,3.03,2.956,2.6079999999999997,2.9539999999999997

897,Val S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,34,6.0,1.0,2016-04-22,"This place was exquisitely bad. First they handed us a pager for when our table was ready, pretty normal. But when it went off they had us get in a line with a bunch of other people whose pagers went off, which defeats the purpose. We didn't have utensils for the first 30 min. The whole thing took over 2hrs. The boneless wings did not taste like chicken, more like a mix of plastic and some sea creature you aren't supposed to eat. The deep dish pizza was basically a pile of wet bread with almost no sauce and glue like cheese. The corndogs were burnt on the outside and raw dough on the inside. My baked potato was gray and slimy. Seriously how do you mess up a baked potato? All it takes is an oven and a potato! The sliders were sickly sweet and the buns looked like they had been colored with a yellow highlighter. The queso was fuzzy. That's the only way to describe it, a fuzzy texture in your mouth. Even the fries were weird. Who leaves most of their fries uneaten? That never happens, but at this place it did. Afterwards all of us felt ill. Gordon Ramsay would have dropped F bombs in all directions here. We should have know after seeing the huge and confusing menu. Potstickers and jambalaya and pizza and pasta and burgers and seafood.

They actually said nothing they just looked at us until we asked for a table for four. We spoke to the manager briefly and he didn't seem to care enough to keep our service so we left and went to Famous Dave's next door. Much better choice!

He doesn't understand the scenario prior to arriving to the table, and just thought my dad ordered the wrong thing, then laughs when he hears what happened. Didn't apologize about the restaurant ruining his birthday dinner, just says the salmon would be taken off the bill. Obviously it's taken off the bill, he never got the salmon!

We are back tonight: (Monday August 1st) and our server recommended the Barbacoa Chicken to my father this evening. I mentioned my experience last time to the waiter and he said this time should be better. We are anxious to try it again and intend to raise this review to a 5 star. Again, thank you for replying to me and I'll email you to let you know how it comes out this time.   Ok it came out kind of the same. Better but still could be improved.  I've attached pictures of the pizookie and how thin it is. It's not even an inch thick anymore. I remember when they filled the tin to the top. It's covered in ice cream, too much. I googled pictures from BJs website to show the drastic difference in the size of the cookie in the pizookie. Unfortunately, I don't feel any need to raise my review to 4 or 5 stars at this time.  (Previous Review) Bjs is a lot of fun. I like the style of the restaurant. It's spacious and has a cool industrial vibe. Inside is surprisingly quieter than the outdoor patio at this particular location. We almost ate outside to try to beat the wait and it echoed so badly out there that you couldn't hear yourself talk. It was filled with huge parties of almost 30 per party. Probably quieter on a less busy evening. We lucked out and the hostess just put us at the first open table inside that she saw. That was so nice.  We came in a few days ago and I ordered the quinoa with salmon. It was so good that I hyped my mom up on it and brought her back tonight. So I ordered her that and I decided to try the barbacoa chicken. It was served on a bed of brown rice with black beans, sprinkled feta, Greek yogurt creme sauce and cilantro. It came out looking like it had been under the heat lamp for about 5 minutes. The beans looked baked together and there wasn't enough Greek yogurt creme sauce so I requested more which made it a little better.  Thankfully my moms salmon lived up to my hype and she loved it.  We ordered the pizookie trio: blueberry lemon, salted caramel and chocolate chip for dessert. The ice cream overloaded the cookie a little too much for the miniature pizookies and made it real soggy. The pizookie cookies are a little on the thinner side. They would be awesome if they were as deep as bjs deep dish pizza. Service was a little slow tonight and food came out at different times but within 3 minutes of each other. but they were busy, that's understandable.  Salmon was a score. Pizzas are very good. I wouldn't order the barbacoa chicken again though unless it was a little better prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=60,2.52,2.8,2.872,2.1559999999999997,2.688

I love how you can basically sit anywhere an at least see the screens. It's a great place to watch sports games on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday. I've been here in the past and all I can remember is that the beer is actually pretty good and the pizza is pretty average. I came in the other night and did not order either. Instead, I ordered a flat bread pizza because it was later at night and it seemed like a lighter options. We had the Italian pizza with sausage and peppers. It was pretty average just like the deep dish. It wasn't packed on with toppings and had a lot of crust. I probably wouldn't get it again. The highlight of the night was the free pizookie. I got the monkey pizookie with vanilla ice cream. This was actually really good. Instead of a cookie, it was a cinnamon bun that was nice and moist.

It was clearly less cooked than the previous peanut butter pizookie - much blonder- and needed probably 4 more minutes in the oven.  Not only did I not want to eat a plate full of cookie dough, but uncooked dough is a health hazard. It can cause salmonella in a normal healthy adult.

This is a dish I've had many times before and usually it comes out so hot that I would burn myself. This time it came out room temperature, borderline cold. Same with the pizza but it was a bit better. Still not anywhere close to ""just got out of an oven"" hot, but it was still somewhat warm. Now if you're wondering why I didn't complain to the waitress, well she wasn't exactly around. Our appetizer came out and we had no small plates.

The burgers were really greasy very old produce, the egg rolls were soggy The Salted Caramel Pizookie was not the size that you get in the restaurant and it was $7.50.  One of the burgers was not supposed to have cheese and there was grated cheese burned onto the bun.  The vegetables in the salad are old and wilted.  The french fries were cold they did not provide wedge fries they were both shoestring so the order was incorrect everything was so greasy the only thing we ate was the burger and that is just the meat we just wasted $65 McDonald's would have been Gourmet compared to this will never be eating again from this establishment!  So angry right now.   Update to my review:  my husband contacted the restaurant directly to put in a complaint spoke with Evan and Elin who were both very apologetic and handled the situation very professionally thank you to you both we were advised to contact GrubHub directly to deal with the issue and they credited our acct.

However, the food I generally get at this BJ's is usually well made.  This particular BJ's is situated at the Tustin Marketplace among a variety of different restaurants. It is located on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Parking can be an issue at times since the area is packed with many different shops and restaurants, but I usually am able to find parking without too much trouble. This BJ's is pretty large and there is a waiting area for those waiting to pick up food or waiting to be seated. The inside is usually pretty clean and the tables are well kept.  The food is the same food you would find at any BJ's, so I'll talk more about the execution. I've had the sirloin steak at several different BJ's and have never been disappointed by the quality of the steak at this location. I've also had several other dishes and have usually not been disappointed. The service at this BJ's is also usually very good, all of the staff and friendly and helpful.

She keeps both with her in case of emergencies and handed her the wrong one. Also, I requested no chicken on my Cobb salad, so at the end of the meal I simply asked politely if I could have a discount for the chicken since I didn't get it on my salad. I did get a tiny bit of bacon (but I could've held that, too). The manager then came by and said they don't have a way to do a discount on their computer system...so yeah...weird response and I just felt that I didn't matter as a customer. I think in this day and age, doing a tiny discount for people who don't eat meat or who do without some meat isn't a big issue. What if we was full vegetarian and wanted a Cobb salad? There's no way to ring it in without meat for a discounted price? That's a little confusing for everyone. I work in a restaurant part-time and take off $6 on salads and lunches without chicken, beef, and fish. If it's a corporate policy, I'd gladly like to speak to corporate.  Our food was okay. Hot appetizers didn't come out hot at all. Our first server took a break and our second server was really busy.  But he was polite.

My boyfriend spoke to Daniel on several occasions.  On the Thursday before my graduation, my boyfriend decided to go to BJ's (in person) to confirm with Daniel, for the last time, about our graduation accommodations.  Daniel was not there.  My boyfriend then talked to another woman, who was in a managerial capacity.  The woman said she had no idea who my boyfriend was, and that no reservations had been placed under his name, nor mine.  We were outraged.  The woman then put our names in, and told us she did not know what Daniel had arranged, but she would TRY and accommodate us.   On the day of my graduation celebration, we did not have the sides of the patio.  Our guests did not get to eat ""buffet"" style, as people generally tend to eat more when it is in a ""buffet"" style.  Rather, we were crammed in two elongated tables, with little to no room for anyone to mingle and talk.  The guests segregated themselves as the way the tables were set up did not allow anyone to mingle with one another much.   I was very displeased.  It was then that my boyfriend and I got the attention of a general manager, Ricky.  Ricky did everything and anything to accommodate us.  He made sure my two tables (along with our guests) were well taken care of.  He basically saved the day.  The four stars I am giving BJ's is for people like Ricky.  Ricky was a people person that day.  Because of him, I was content, my guests - happy and full.  Many of the guests that I was with even said that they would be coming back to BJ's because of their exceptional service.  THANK YOU RICKY.   The lack of the 5th star is for people like Daniel.  Because every employer is responsible for their employees (as BJ's is for Daniel), they should honor what Daniel had agreed upon with us, and hold him accountable.  Although we did not get the side of the patio as was previously agreed nor did we get food served in a ""buffet"" style as opposed to ""family"" style (which is what we got), our guests, nonetheless, ended up content.  We had plenty of food to give the guests to take home.   Upon leaving BJ's, I ran into another one of my fellow law school graduates.  I made sure she knew about Ricky, and told her that if she needed anything, to definitely talk to Ricky. Again, thank you Ricky for saving the day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40,3.24,2.91,2.944,3.024,3.0420000000000007

But not last night. I was LITERALLY blown away by the service we received. I rarely walk into retail or restaurants within 30 min of closing, simply because I know how one or two tables straggling in late can slow down the closing process. I confess I was that guy last night, coming in late and sitting at the bar already having my order ready when the server came by to grab our waters. ( my GO-TO: buffalo chicken deep dish, no celery, no onion ). I could tell the gentlemen taking care of us might have been a bit tired after a long slow shift however that did not stop him from flashing a welcoming smile and going above and beyond with waiting on our table. He was stealthy on our H2O refills without us even having to ask or do the casual ""look around for your server cause I'm getting thirsty"" neck turn lol. He didn't seem bothered by simple requests like more buffalo sauce on the side or extra lemon for my glass of water. The pizza hit the spot as always and he made sure that we were 100% satisfied with the meal. We ended up scarfing our meals down before they even hit closing time which was perfect seeing how the dining room/bar was still 25% full at the time we left. Couldn't have been more happy with the quick bite to eat and great service we encountered. I gladly tipped our server 75% because give credit when credit is due should be practiced more often in food&beverage business'.

We've already visited BJ's on Jamboree several times, and few times with my parents on select occasions. Today was no different. My father and mother gave a nice dinner party to their grandson Rohan for graduating with Aerospace Engineering degree from UT Austin and finding a great job at SpaceX. We enjoyed the hot appetizers (Fried Asparagus, Stuffed Mushrooms and Spinach/Artichoke dip) with shots of beer (whereas I don't drink, I saw that my family enjoyed the samples.) The food arrived quick, smelled great and was freshly prepared. The main course was even better... entrees ordered included Veggie Quinoa, Deep Dish Pizza, Penne Pasta, Tacos and Portobello Burger. Each entree was prepared well, served hot and tasted awesome! The pasta was just a bit heavy with red tomato sauce. We pretty much finished all our food except a couple of slices of pizza (which will make a nice lunch for one of us.) A trip to BJ's is never complete without the final guilty pleasure...

Wtf?!  Reheated?!  No I don't want you to nuke it in the microwave. All along we are still waiting for our salad.

BJs is known for their pizzas and pizookie desserts, so I totally recommend those, but not really anything else except their root beer. I got the unlimited soup and salad and it was honestly disappointing. The soups tasted like they were from a can, especially the clam chowder and chicken tortilla. The chicken tortilla was a disgrace by the way. It was thick and way too salty. Chicken tortilla soup should be clear and light. The salads were kinda unhealthy. Definitely ask for dressing on the side because they liked to drown their salads. I got the wedge which was covered in ranch and bacon  No thanks. The tomato salad was whatever. House salad was the only decent one because it was pretty much a normal salad with romaine, spring greens, carrots, etc. But hey, it's unlimited, so I brought some home. I like their normal cookie pizookies, so I decided to try the monkey bread version. Unless you like dense and thick chewy bread, this is your thing. I like my monkey bread fluff and light, so this was disappointing. Ice cream was delivered though, especially the chocolate Ghirardelli.

While I have been to other locations, I am happy to report that this one is the closet for me and probably the best.  The last time I was here was (7/2/17) with fellow Yelper Candice K and we had a good ole time.  We sat in the bar area left hand corner, which had a great view of multiple TVs. Candice wanted to check out the Angels game and it was on the big screen. The staff is very accommodating with the TVs (I assume as long as they have the channels and no other guests care too much). On this particular day our server was Bianca and she took great care of us. Initially we were catching up and talking for a while but that didn't stop her from checking in on us frequently which is much appreciated.  We finally were ready to order and we decided to go with: *App* Root Beer Glazed Wings --- I ordered them extra crispy and they came out very nice, crunchy but full of that sticky flavor glaze. Cooked thoroughly, so there are no complaints here. I would order again.  *Entrees* Full Rack Of Ribs --- Good glaze. Meaty and not too dry. I was kind of surprised because you never know if they will be too dry but I would order these again.  Rib Eye --- A very nice slab of meat. Cooked medium. Good flavor. Juicy *Sides* Green Beans --- Tender. Juicy. Not much to say. Overall good. Asparagus --- Seasoned well with the right amount of crunch.  *Drinks* House Blonde --- Cold and good tasting. *Dessert* Pizookie Trio --- Monkey Bread. White Chocolate. Peanut Butter. The PB was the definite hit out of the 3 for us with WC coming in second. MB was ok but may have been a little too sweet and not as soft, but it was ok.  I believe this is all we had and the experience was overall good. We were also able to take advantage of a BOGO entree which wasn't a bad deal at all. And our server was cool about it. I say that because I've been to places where you would present a coupon and sometimes the server would seem like they had an attitude with it or something. My thing is, if they weren't meant to be used then the company wouldn't have made them. And with that being said, make sure you tip appropriately; especially when you're getting a deal. A lot of servers work hard and coupons shouldn't cut into their bottom line.  All in all a good day and a good job from Bianca. I will be back.

SERVICE: Waitress was nice, but never came to our table at the right time. I had to FLAG DOWN waiters or waitresses to take our order, add to our order, and get refills many times. Our drinks were never filled unless we asked and even then, they would only fill the person who has the least water, but not everyone?!  FOOD: We all weren't feeling pizza so we opted for 3 pasta dishes and their new quinoa dish. -Thai Soba Noodles: Poorly cooked and came as a mush of broken soba noodles. Flavor was okay. -Fettuccini Alfredo: Super sticky -Jambalaya: I asked for pasta instead of rice, which maybe was my mistake, but this was the WORST Jambalaya I've ever had (and this is a go to dish for me at most restaurants). SUPER BLAND. How could you do that to a Jambalaya? The noodles had absolutely no flavor at all except for a bit of olive oil and the peppers, shrimp, sausage, and chicken were all poorly seasoned. DO NOT ORDER NOT WORTH THE $. -Quinoa dish: Unless you really need to watch your weight, no even then I wouldn't suggest this dish. Absolutely NO flavor.

We ordered a pizza, steak, salads, and sliders and EVERYTHING came out room-temperature or cold. The Fries tasted like they'd been made hours ago and just heated up. The pizza tasted old as well.  The only redeeming quality of this location of BJ's was that the servers were super friendly and nice.

My girlfriend went to pick it up about 25 minutes later since they told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes. 45 minutes later, I get a phone call from her that the food is still not ready. About 10 minutes later from that point, I get a call that she finally got the food and she was on the way home. We live literally 2 minutes from this location. When she got home, the wings and avocado egg rolls were soggy and cold. How were they like this if the food was not ready on time and we supposedly got the food right as it was prepared? To top it all off, the pazookie was burnt.  I love BJ's and have never had a bad experience dining in, but their take out was terrible. It was a waste of my ~$35 because I tossed the wings, avocado egg rolls and pazookie in the trash.

Because we love the food at bjs, we decided to wait. However, after roughly 40 minutes I asked again and they said we had to wait another 30 minutes. Angry and hungry we decided to go someplace else to eat but on our way there, about 10 minutes later, we got a text from bjs saying our table is ready. This has caused me to lose all respect for BJs and I urge people not to go to this restaurant especially on a busy night. Not only is the wait ridiculously long but the waiters do not know how to manage the wait times. Never going to this restaurant again. Waste of good food.

Our server was very prompt with our drink orders and the refills just kept coming even before I was at the half way mark there was another one waiting for me!  I never had to ask like I do at most restaurants. Our appetizers arrived and they were so good.  I highly recommend the cheese curds and the potato skins.  I ordered the prime rib special which was huge! Two people could have shared it so I had left overs for lunch the next day. My dinner also came with the pizookies, I choose chocolate chip. Even though I was stuffed from dinner I hate 2/3 of it by myself. The only regret I have about the pizookies is that I had never had one until that day!  The whole experience at BJ's was awesome.

I have to say tons of people will easily go out of their way to write complaints to receive compensation, but very few will to recognize prestige service. Haven't been to a BJ's in a while due to a few reasons. We came in last night 12/23 celebrating Friendsmas there was 7 of us, got sat on the patio which we weren't too happy with first off and the host could be a tad happier, it is the holidays. It took a brief moment for us to be greeted by Anthony our server who we noticed was quite busy so no worries. He came and Greeted us with a very warming and apologetic opening for the slight wait, took our drink order and was very knowledgeable, especially with all of us wanting to try new and different drinks. He then helped us choose a few appetizers and we asked him to surprise us with some as well, he made great choices must I say. I do have to say being a people watcher I was noticing how meticulous and organized he is with his tables and tables prioritizing "" me being a server for 15 years"" started to get a little empathic when I over heard a table complaining and talking about issues that were out of his control and not paying enough attention when he alone seemed to have almost a 1/3 of that huge patio! When our entrees came out he was completely on top of everything to make sure each dish was out and correct along with any condiments needed. must I also say we didn't once need to remind him for drink refills or removing dishes as needed. As for our dessert we provided our own alone with a few great pizookis and Anthony cleared out our whole table and set it for dessert as if we were eating at Mastros without even having to ask. WOW! With his load and continuing up with everyone! I hope to Have that gentleman as my server ever time I come BJ's from here on out!!! Bravo Service! Please be sure to thank Anthony for us as we were in a rush after paying!

The last couple of times we were here the pizzas were undercooked; they tasted better when we took them home and put them in the toaster oven, but that's not saying much. The beer samplers used to be a gem - 6 samplers was the # but  now it's reduced to 4 without changing the price. Not cool. The service is a bit chaotic. We'll have anywhere between 3-4 servers. In theory I guess that makes for efficiency but call me ol' fashioned, I like the one on one server so that the tip is well earned.  Lastly, and perhaps the underlying reason for a 3 star. There are numerous times (3x too many) where for whatever reason we could see the frustration on the staff- and I get it, everyone has their day, especially in food/hospitality.

They told us they would text us when our table was ready, so we waited. We got a text, so we went up to the front to get seated and this host just asked for our name and she looked at us like we were stupid because I guess she didn't see that they texted us. Then, another host realized that he didn't put our slip with our table, so he handed it to the host who looked at us like we were stupid. We arrive to our table and we see three chairs and a high chair. She rolled her eyes and said are you going to need another chair ? And we said yeah like it's common sense, so she sighs and adds another chair. And she tells us next time you have to say five people including the high chair with a major attitude. At this point, I've had it with her attitude, so I gave her attitude back and said that we said 4 people and a high chair. Idk, how hard it is to get that right. I worked at a restaurant and people would tell me that and I would understand that it means four chairs and a high chair. She ends up slamming the silverware on our table and says well you can talk to my manager like she didn't care. The manager ended up coming saying I heard you aren't happy with your table and we said that weren't at all it was with the service that we had receive. We explained what had happened and that we understand that it's overwhelming sometimes working a restaurant when it's busy, but that doesn't give her the right to treat customers like that. The manager just said okay I agree, we will go over it with her. Like that is gonna make up for having been treated horribly. Our server was very kind and made up for the horrible hostess experience.
