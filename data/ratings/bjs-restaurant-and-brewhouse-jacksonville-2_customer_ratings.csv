139,Bob S.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,269,134.0,3.0,2013-08-05,"Seated quickly, service was a bit spotty.   Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak.  It was pretty good, very tender, but the veggies were over-seasoned.  Meal was delivered by someone who was not my server, which is fine, but there was no silverware on the table, and my server took a few minutes to make it by to see how things were going. Noise level was high.  It was ok, nothing special.  Essentially an upscale Applebee's, with pricing to match.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=120,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668
154,John L.,"Kenosha, WI",2,29,2.0,3.0,2013-08-15,"Dinner on a Thursday night, very busy around 6, but was able to squeeze in at the bar with no wait. Servers were very friendly. Had the full flight of 8 beers surprisingly good compared to many other brew pubs I've been to, even the styles I typically don't care for were quite drinkable, the only exception being the stout which was a bit on the bitter side. The only dissapointment were the chicken wings having ordered the XXXX-hot I expected to at least break a sweat but in all honesty they were milder than the spicy chix sand at the clown's drive through. The bartender offered a couple hot sauces and a side of jalepenos to compensate, lol, even with the additional heat I'd consider these kid friendly. For a $9.50 app they were also surprisingly small. The burger however more than made up for it. Had the bacon blue cheese burger which was a good size burger perfectly cooked to medium rare. Next time I'd skip the app, but definitely worth a repeat visit for both the beer and the food if this was any indication of the rest of the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=160,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

I think she had ALL of the outside tables by herself but she still was just the right amount of attentive to me and never showed a bad/stressed attitude so I really appreciated that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=160,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

The wait staff are very friendly and the food is promptly served. The hand tossed pizza is very good, but I tried the deep dish chicken bacon ranch pizza this time and it was the bomb! That's my new favorite.  My son got the clam chowder soup in a bread bowl and he enjoyed it thoroughly. I would have rated it a 5 star if it wasn't for the loaded baked potato my wife received one evening. You think you would get one with all the fixens, but with butter and sour cream only and it was $8. That was a fail. Everything else we've had has been really good.

As she was taking my order she thought it was a good idea to stop and talk to another waitress in the middle of me telling her what I wanted multiple times. She put our order in then apparently they switched servers on us. The first server that took our order never told the second one anything, and on top of it the first server put our order in wrong. So we ended up waiting forever for my g/f to get her beer which came nearly at the end of the meal. They forgot my caesar which also ended up arriving at the end of the meal. Food was alright and I don't remember what we got. I got some kind of pasta. I've had a better experience at the town center spot, but I'm sure the servers were just annoyingly terrible at their job.

Two of the party unwrapped dirty silverware. Got the dinner order wrong for one of the party.  Trip 3. Waiter was friendly enough but never kept a good eye on the drinks and he looked like he had too many tables to tend to. Took him way to long to get the food order and one of the dishes was terrible.  The atmosphere is great. The beers are good. I think there is promise in this place but somebody needs to get the service problems resolved or this place will go belly up. I would love to like this place.

Had a pleasant first trip to see what they were all about since I'm a big fan of Gordon Biersch that we went to in Virginia Beach frequently.  This past time we decided to go since no one could decide on what they would like to have for dinner and I remember BJ's has a ridiculously LARGE and EXPANSIVE menu - personally I prefer smaller menu choices, but in this case it worked in our favor.  Our friends had gotten the table already and I arrived with my in-laws shortly after. We were seated and our waitress, who I assumed gave her name in the beginning encounter of my friends, took drinks orders for only my FIL. She came back and I unfortunately tried to knock my snark towards her when I interjected if she would like to take my drink order rather than assume I want just water. I guess she meant well, but instead of trying to win us over with her over the top personality she could pay attention to more detail in making sure she asked for everyone's order. Her memory is great for reciting back our orders and the food was really good - though I will say that when they have a server who gets their white button down super dirty with food stains that they would ask them to change because she looked super unkempt and unprofessional for their atmosphere they are trying to produce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=100,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8920000000000003,3.1200000000000006

I had the pork chop entree from their light menu. It came with green beans, boiled new potatoes, and grilled onion. The pork chop had a nice glaze but was a bit chewy. I like vegetables that are cooked but still crunchy. The green beans were crunchy but undercooked. The grilled onion included a ring of the dried skin that normally would have been discarded when preparing the onion. I enjoyed glasses of their nutty brewnette brown and pumpkin ales.

In no time, our server came and we ordered drinks. My mother got a Raspberry Lemonade and I got a Berry Burst Cider. I love trying different kinds of ciders and this one got my attention because I hadn't had a cider made from raspberries, blackberries and other wild berries. It was refreshing. Mom always enjoys her lemonade. We ordered the Spinach and Arichoke dip, which seems to be the go-to appetizer for us. There was clearly more chips than dip which I think is a total waste but it is what it is. The dip was ok, nice big chunks or artichoke pieces in it.  For our entrees, I got the Barbeque Bison Burger and had the option of a House, Caesar, or Mozzarella Tomato salsa. I chose the last one. My mother ordered the Black and Bleu House Burger. Our entrees were taking a long time and our server was so proactive about it. He notified us that there was a party of 20 ahead of us and ours would be coming out after that our was done. When he brought my salad he also chased and swatted a bee away from our table? So brave hahaha. The mozzarella and tomato salad was very good. I love how the cheese was shaped into little balls. Cute. A few minutes later our burgers came out. Both looked delicious. Mom's burger came with bacon which she didn't like. She gave it to me which I happily ate. Her burger only came well done and she's used to having it medium-well, but she ate it and said it was good. My burger was good as well but not as good as Ted's bison burgers.

Cue last night when an evening of shopping left my mother and I hungry. We arrived around 7pm. The restaurant was packed and I seriously doubted the quoted 15 minute wait time.  At 20 minutes our buzzer went off and I was pleasantly surprised. We started with mozzarella sticks because I had been craving them. For $8 we got 10 large mozzarella sticks, fried beautifully and crunchy topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  My craving was well satiated. For dinner, mom had the fried chicken and wedge salad.  The salad was a big hit with large blue cheese crumbles, bacon and tomatoes.  Her chicken was nicely fried and a very generous portion. She took half of it home. I chose the balsamic glazed chicken and seriously enjoyed my dinner.  The chicken was nicely grilled and served with salad greens, onions, the balsamic sauce and mashed potatoes.  The balsamic sauce was sweet, tangy, and I was dipping chicken along the edges of the plate to get more. So yummy.  Shout out to the cheddar mashed potatoes. Obviously homemade and probably tons of cream and butter which made them very creamy and so good I didn't want to stop eating. I also took home half my meal because of large portions. Our server was Kate and she was just great. Efficient, personable, and attentive without being intrusive.  A large party was seated in her section and she stopped by her tables asking if they needed anything before she started the large party because her attention wouldn't be as available for a little while.  Classy move, Kate.  You're a great server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.768,3.3200000000000003

He was hungry and ready for a drink. I thought we might as well try this place again since I'm rarely in the area.  After dumping some layers of clothes, he decides to eat outside. He gets something from the tap. I grab water with lemon and wait to see if this will be a repeat of non existent service from earlier. It wasn't. Avocado Egg Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms were awesome. He had Jalapeño Burger with bacon and said it was pretty sweet. I was too stuffed for dessert and he rather try craft. He enjoyed both his meal and drink. And we both enjoyed the service.  That's strange. When it was empty I was completely looked over? When it was busy and I have company - great service, quick and good food.

The food is always good and they have a wide variety of drinks if you're looking to try some new beers/ciders/wines. They're reasonably priced for the food and their HH is pretty good - half off appetizers and mini pizzas.  I ordered the balsamic chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes and got a pear cider to pair with it. Both were delicious! The balsamic chicken was a bit on the sweet side and the chicken could've been moister but all in all it was delicious when you ate all the components on the plate together. It also came with a small frisee salad which helped tone down the indulgent feel of the meal. What made the dish on the sweeter side was the balsamic glaze which was super sweet, but the savoriness of the chicken and mashed potatoes really helped it balance out. The pear cider was also pretty tasty and we were able to sit outside on the patio, watch some baseball, and enjoy some FL sun.

I spoke with a manager (Darren)and he ended up taking those 2 items off my ticket and informed me there was a whole new staff in the kitchen and serving and apologized. He seemed sincere.

My usual reaction to this was to just eat it because, hey, I was traveling, eating in my hotel room,  and it was the only food I had!  So as I muddled through the sweet hickory sauce and brisket that was atop.

Thanks to that my appetite was ruined, shattered, unable to recover.  I could not finish it.  I found a nice cozy home for it in the bottom of the hotel trashcan.  Hours later, I was still hungry and had to nibble on the only food I had left.... my three dollar Annie's Cheddar Bunnies, which proved to be much tastier than that particular $12.95 burger.  Thanks for the memory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=80,3.32,3.1,3.1,2.724,3.1880000000000006

I want to give some credit where credit is due. Yesterday, I received a call from the general manager of this location. Now, as I stated in my first review, I had previously talked to a manager and she didn't even ask me for my name or phone number to follow up with me. I only received the call from the GM after filling out a survey that BJ's sent me directly via email about my experience that night. The other manager I spoke to initially didn't even notify the GM of my complaint. The conversation that I had with the general manager was a good one, and he sincerely apologized for my experience, and assured me that the issue has been addressed. We spoke for about 6-7 minutes, which is in stark contrast to the ten seconds that the other manager had me on the phone. He sent me a $25 gift card to use at BJ's as well. That's literally all I wanted, for my issue to be verbally addressed with the employee and for me to be reimbursed for my meal. As I said previously, I don't spend my hard earned money at a restaurant to have my non-black server say racial slurs, especially n****r. In the end, I'm satisfied with the response that I received, and I really and truly respect and thank the general manager for calling me directly to address the situation. If I had received such a response from the first manager I spoke to, I'm sure I'd feel a little differently than I do now. Although I appreciate the GM's sincerity and professionalism, I shouldn't have had to fill out a survey for someone to address the issue. I tried to go up the chain of command before posting my review here and before filling out that survey, but that method failed me. This could have all been dealt with in-house. My intention has never been to get anyone in trouble, or worse, fired, but I did want to make sure that it didn't happen again and that my voice was heard. I'm usually a pretty chill customer, and I don't really complain much, even when the food I order isn't all that. I've actually never asked to speak to a manager with an issue at a restaurant in my entire life, until now. So when I do speak up, it's about something that is important to me. In the end, I can sleep well knowing that the situation was ultimately resolved as it should have been in the first place, but I still have a bitter taste in my mouth regarding my whole experience with this BJ's location. I most likely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=40,3.32,3.14,3.14,2.7600000000000007,3.2120000000000006

33,Ellie H.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,20,,2.0,2017-04-26,"Been here twice, and both times there was something terrible about it. As a national chain, BJ's can be nice. Their selection is great and they do have some unique things to eat/drink, as far as what's listed. However, here there is a major problem with the staff and sometimes the kitchens.  The first time I came with my fiance we were meeting up with a couple of friends. Despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty, our waitress took so long getting to us (for the order, food, and refills/to check), that we had to go and get our own things from inside. The food was average, but the beer flights were nice (despite taking 30+ minutes to get to the table), and the pizookie's were genuinely too delicious for words, when they arrived an hour later (especially cookies and cream). The management did try very hard to make it right however, which is why we went back to give them the second shot.  The second time around the wait staff was okay (though they did stand around a little watching a spectacle on the road across the street in plain view of the customers)-- but the kitchen staff all rushed out to participate in the spectacle themselves (which was pointed out to us by the staff watching! I really do hope they washed their hands before resuming work after pushing the cars around). I have never seen that happen before, and couldn't begin to guess why that was acceptable. As a result, it took forever to get our food. When we did finally get the food (appetizers were just okay, nothing too special, but there wasn't anything wrong with them either), both of our steaks were beyond well done, though we had ordered them medium. They were tough as dry leather shoes. The asparagus and brussel sprout sides were on the bland/bitter side, but not inedible. The steaks got taken back to the kitchen, and while my steak reemerged okay (nothing to write home about, but tender at least), my fiancees steak came out with heaping piles of gristle, and somehow half very rare (almost raw), and half well done. I have no idea how the same single piece of steak was half cooked, half not, as I've never had one so unevenly cooked before. The management reemerged, but did not do much beyond apologize (no explanation regarding the kitchen staff). We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2?start=20,3.2,3.12,3.12,2.6960000000000006,3.1520000000000006

Took awhile to get any kind of drinks, when our waitress did come she took our drink order, I was ready to order also.  She wasn't ready to take our order at the time said she'll be right back.  Ummmmm ok  she brings out drinks which felt like forever. She than took out order, my son got Alfredo and chicken and I got a jalapeño burger(medium) . The food made it to the table in a timely manner. I cut into my burger and it's well done, wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't dry. I take a few bites and realize my son is eating with his hands. I yell at him about table manners and he tells me he doesn't have anything to eat with. He was right, our waitress finally comes back and we ask for silverware she said ok I'll be right back. She never came back she walks past us my son yells to her about his silverware. She nods and keeps walking. We waited while he eats with his hands, she never came back. I finally tell him to wipe his hands and go find any waiter/waitress for silverware. When she finally makes her way back to the table, she doesn't say anything about the silverware she was supposed to be getting,  I ask for refills she says ok. She brought my son another sprite but didn't refill my water. When she came back to clear our plates my son ordered dessert before I could stop him. How bad can they mess up dessert so I say it's ok. He ordered the kids cookie and ice cream. That was a huge mistake it took 25 minutes for it to get to the table. Not once did our waitress stop by again. She returned 10 min after the dessert was delivered with the check. Luckily I had my card in hand waiting.

Once he ordered the Jambalaya and it came with grossly undercooked chicken. For my own part, I've decided to give up even attempting to ever order the steamed broccoli. They can't seem to grasp the concept of how to steam broccoli. But recently they told me about a policy that finally made me decide to write a review. I don't know if this is a franchise wide practice or specific to this location. But my buddy ordered (or rather attempted to order) the Tuscan Tomato Bisque. We were informed that they don't serve soup in the last hour. To me that just smacks of laziness. I'm reasonably certain it's because they want to get out early so they stop serving soup so they can wash the associated dishes early.

Over 1/3  of the steak was lard all the way through, so I cut that piece off and showed to my waitress so she  i went and got a manager. My asparagus looked old, almost brown and it appeared to have been chewed and spit out. The waitress brought me brocolli and apologized for the asparagus. Everybody makes mistakes but to see the waitress take ownership showed me leadership quality.  All if a sudden,  here comes the manager,  Holly. She didnt accept responsability for the  bad vegetables or the steak. Instead, I get an explanation  about how all prime rib has fat and it was a bad cut. She says these kind of things happen from time to time. She tells me she can't bring a replacement piece of steak and continues in to say "" Next time you come in  order a center cut piece"" Is she for real,  I just ordered a $28 steak and 1/3 of it was lard and they expect there to be a next time?

A burger and fries and chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were disappointing, lacking flavor and no crunch. Husband says the burger was prepared as requested, but nothing to write home about. Same for the fries. Another beverage was delivered to me, but this time the peachberry tea was not sweet. Imagine the surprise my taste buds had with that.

I mean, I don't want to waste 30 min of a lunch hour waiting for a burger twice. And given another chance to make it right, I got an apology. Even after being asked to call in. Ok. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2,3.16,3.2,3.2,,3.1840000000000006
0,Justin M.,"Savannah, GA",66,5,5.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"The night started out horribly. We were told we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Less than 5 min later, we were rudely interpreted by the pager; get your stuff together, BJ's, we want a clear plan of action. It was a good thing the bartender had poured us some of the smallest beers I've ever seen and kindly waived the cost. We may have missed our table otherwise. While my entrée, an authentic, thin-crust, Extreme Pepperoni pizza, was excellent, another patron in my party received a pepperoni pizza that looked like a rotten loaf of bagged bread with some cheese tossed atop. It was so thick that it arrived in a special pan, with tall outer rims, to prevent the mess of a product from spilling onto the table. It was almost as if BJ's intended on making such a disaster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2,3.28,3.19,3.19,,3.226
4,Alisha S.,"Frederick, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-30,"Personally I love most BJ's but we ended up leaving because the hostess was very unprofessional and inefficient at this branch. We were a party of 4 (which we told her multiple times), but she input us as a party of 2. There were people that came after us who had already gotten seated. When they finally called our name and there were 4 of us, she tried to make us wait some more due to her mistake. It would have been fine except she did not own up to her mistake at all and tried to make us wait more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville-2,3.12,3.15,3.15,,3.138
