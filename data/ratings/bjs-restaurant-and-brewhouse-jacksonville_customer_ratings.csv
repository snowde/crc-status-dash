I finally went to the front of the restaurant and once again the hostess wasn't there, I had to wait a few more minutes to get sat. I was very annoyed and now extremely hungry.

When we drove up I was expecting there to be a long wait and see high prices but it wasn't that at all.   On a Saturday night, also NYE, there was little wait for a table for three.  I think there may have been a five minute wait. We ordered two of the small plates, fried artichoke and stuffed mushrooms...both amazing.   For dinner I order the Thai Salmon.  It was really good but the sauce was described as ""spicy thai sauce"" and it was not spicy at all.  If anything it was sweet because of the mango salsa.  I don't want to take away from how good it was, just not 100% what I was expecting. While focusing on dinner and not drinking I didn't try any alcoholic beverages but hear their beer is good and had my eye on the pomegranate sunset cocktail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=120,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

Steven is as good of a waiter as it gets - he was friendly, attentive and made sure that our entire experience was nothing less than perfect. For our appetizer, we ordered crispy fried artichokes and chicken wontons - both were scrumptious.

204,Debbie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,18,27.0,2.0,2012-04-17,"Went to BJ's on a Thursday night with eager stomachs. The restaurant is visually very appealing. It's modern and sophisticated but still inviting enough for flip-flops or shorts. While the design won me over, the food disappointed me. It disappointed because it was so average. The food was bland at best; as if the chef was afraid of spices. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and wasn't impressed at all. I've had better burgers at backyard BBQ's.  An order of Mac n Cheese lacked any actual cheese. The server did just the bare minimum so that was a fail as well. It says a lot about a place when the tomato and mozzarella salad was the best part of the meal. In conclusion, Go to BJ's for their brewhouse not their food. Their food is average at best and not worth your hard earned coin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=200,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
228,Wendy G.,"Jacksonville, FL",33,26,,2.0,2012-04-18,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this place.  Yes, the outside is appealing and the bar is as well  First off- I dont quite understand why happy hour is only allowed at the bar - What is the difference between sitting at the bar or at the table? What a way to cheap out BJ's!  So after ordering my $11 cosmo which sort of tasted like a mixture of water, sugar, and  a shot of grenadine  - we recieved our Avocado rolls which sounded delicious! - They were mediocre at best - The Avocado rolls were very soggy and drenched in grease - I could barely taste any other flavors except avocado. I love avocado just not deep fried in grease.  Then, on to the main course - I ordered a chicken ceasar salad - It was OK at the best but nothing to write home about - very dissapointing  - you would think for approximately $15 a plate you can do better ! I probably will not come back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=220,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

I enjoyed all:  pizza, atmosphere, beer and the company.  The menu had tons of choices...reminded me of Cheesecake Factory's menu, with so many diverse choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=160,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004
169,Anne-Marie B.,"Houston, TX",171,234,121.0,3.0,2012-06-17,"I have been a fan of BJ's Brewhouse for YEARS. That being said, I was disappointed when they opened one in Jacksonville because I know what we Jacksonvillians like to do with good restaurant concepts; take them and make them obnoxiously mediocre. Had I written this review prior to my most recent visit, I probably would have tacked on an extra star.  Unfortunately, the experience I just had was completely ridiculous. Myself and 3 others went for lunch. Our server walked up as the 4th member was joining. She had no sooner sat down and gone to take her purse off her shoulder when he immediately asked if we were all ready to order. Obviously, we were not, nor were we when he returned about 45 seconds later. This time, he asked and one member in our party said she was not quite ready but she'd go last to order. I was halfway through relaying my order to the server when he interrupted me and said, ""I'll give you some more time"" and walked away. (for anyone who's interested, this was the point in the meal when I determined what percentage of my $10 bill was going to go towards his tip...) Once he finally returned, we ordered. I got the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza, and the rest were simple orders as well. We sat there for an excessively long time waiting for our meal, so the manager finally walked up and apologized for the inconvenience and assured us that our order would be out shortly. About 10 minutes later, our food came. Here's where it gets really disappointing:  Flash back to a year ago when I saw the construction sign that said a BJ's Brewhouse was opening in August. I sold it to all of my friends as a place that was consistently good, straightforward food... ...then came the buffalo chicken pizza. Words cannot describe how ravenously hungry I was at the point that I received my pizza, and by the appearance of it as it sat in front of me, it'd been sitting in the window under a heat lamp for easily 20 minutes. The chopped celery that was on top as a garnish was wilted and dry, the cheese was rubbery and disgusting, and the crust was lukewarm. I was SO disappointed. You let me down, BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=160,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

I ordered the ""Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo"" with blackened chicken.  The chicken on top was luke warm, the pasta over-cooked, and the worst of all offenses the Alfredo was milk colored water. The server was not attentive to refills. He seemed upset we did not order any beer and gave obviously better service to the next table over. One additional pet-pevee, the small two person table we were sat at was SMALL.

The first time, our server was awesome. The food was yum (avocado rolls were weird, but good and pizza was great!!!). The second time we sat outside and it was really nice except the smoking, but that's not the restaurant's fault. We had pizza again and it was delicious again. Then, recently we got a pizza to go and it was great even after 10 minutes in the car. The crust on their pizza is the best for real.  It is pretty loud inside. But, since it's so big, I would expect it to be. Their homemade beers are pretty good. They also have homemade root beer, which was yummy.

First, I ordered the mahi-mahi fish tacos, which is my go to dish.  Last time they were great.  This time, they had sat under the heat lamp so the tortillas got dried out.  Still tasted fine, but I don't like my soft tacos to be masquerading as crispy tacos.  Again, the quality of the food was fine overall. But we hardly saw our waitress after that.  The salad plates remained on the table even after the entrees came.  I did get a drink refill, but again no finished plates were removed.  I was about to ask the manager to turn off the cloaking device, because obviously none of the wait staff could see the growing pile of dishes.  Remember, this is a table fo seven, so the dishes add up fast.  The waitress returned to inquire about desert.  Again no dishes left.  Checks came before the desert did: no dishes left.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for desert (at least, we lost track of time it took so long).  Still no dishes left the table. I'm sorry, but that is one of the basics of service: keep the table cleared of enmpty dishes, drinks full, and inquire if you can do more (hmm, upsale too maybe, huh?)

184,Jim R.,"Orange Park, FL",1,4,,2.0,2013-07-05,"After catching a movie on the 4th of July, my wife and I weren't in the mood to head home and cook.  So, we decided to grab a bite out with our two sons (12 & 14).  I was in the mood to try a place that we hadn't visited yet.  After gravitating toward St. John's Town Center, we ended up at BJ's. Both the exterior and the interior give off a promising vibe.  Going by looks, you know BJ's is a chain; but, it gives the impression of a chain closer to Carraba's than Olive Garden, if you know what I mean. As they weren't busy, we were seated immediately.  Within seconds of being seated, our waiter was at table side asking for drink orders.  At most places, this might be a good thing.  However, BJ's calls themselves a Brewhouse.  Please give me a minute or two to peruse the selection of beers, if that is your specialty. The waiter, who spoke at a pace that would rival the guy from the old FedEx commercials, came back a few minutes later.  I forget the names of the brews my wife and I ordered.  She got a paler one that is recommended with a lemon wedge.  I got the Irish Red.  We also ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.  Fast talker asked if we were ready to order our entrees.  Dude, we barely had time to look at the the beer list.  Give us a minute. He came back a few minutes later with our drinks.  We decided to order one of their specialties, a deep dish pizza with meatballs, sausage, tomatoes and jalapeños.  At this point, everything looked promising.  The beers were cold and tasty.  The pizza looked great on the menu.  Plus, we had fried cheese on the way.  The fast talking waiter was a bit too eager.  But, that that is much better than an inattentive one. The first sign of average, at best, food came with the cheese sticks.  Not that they were bad, mind you.  Just that they were exceedingly average.  I expect that they were of the frozen variety and not hand made fresh in-house.  We were getting pretty hungry at that point and they were passable. Then, the ""deep dish"" pizza came out.  While the pizza looked OK, it also was not like any deep dish pizza that I ever had.  Let me clarify something.  I know that this is a chain.  I wasn't expecting a pizza that would rival the best of Chicago.  I was expecting something at least the equivalent of Pizzeria Uno's. A deep dish pizza should have a nice bite to it.  Not too thick.  But, sturdy enough to hold up to the toppings.  The sides should be vertical, as the dough is pressed up the sides of the pan.  The bottom and sides should have a nice texture that is enjoyable to bite through. This was a limp mess.  I can't even necessarily call it undercooked, as the crust had a nice, golden brown color to it.  It simply had no ""body"".  It was thick, limp and doughy instead of crisp, sturdy and hearty.  The toppings were plentiful except for the jalapeños, which were diced to an almost imperceptibly small size. While we should have sent it back and ordered something else, we were very hungry at this point and did not.  I had a couple of pieces.  My wife and two sons had one each.  My wife asked for a cup of tomato bisque, which came quickly and was good. All in all, a very disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=180,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.536,3.0800000000000005
178,Matt S.,"St. Augustine, FL",63,515,58.0,4.0,2013-07-21,"On a recent excursion to the Town Center, my wife and I were deciding on a place to grab lunch. We generally head to Whisky River, however we wanted to try something new, and we had yet to visit BJ's. I was surprised to see that even as we arrived for lunch on a Saturday, the parking lot was completely full, and there were plenty of tables open, however we opted for sitting at the bar area. The restaurant is wide open, with plenty of room to move about, and the bar area was clean and offered comfortable seats with views of a flatscreen TV with four different channels on it. I am a beer lover, and was fairly impressed with the selection of draft beers available- glad they lived up to the Brewhouse part of their name. Nothing incredibly impressive, but a nice selection of national and even their own craft brews. We ordered some beers and decided to skip the appetizer, but we did see a lot of tasty plates being ushered past us while we were trying to decide our meals. The majority of items on the menu were actually pizza related, with a few chicken, beef, pasta, and sandwiches / burgers thrown in the mix. I chose the california burger which arrived in a timely manner, and it was pretty darn tasty, and exactly as I ordered it. The beef was tender and juicy, topped with delicious fresh veggies, avocados, and tasty cheesy goodness. I also really enjoyed the shoestring french fries that came with it, they were very delicious. The wife and I both cleared the plates and put down a few pints of Samuel Adams Summer Ale, and had  a good experience doing it. Our server was very attentive, got everything correct, and took good care of us- overall, I had a great experience at BJ's. I would bet this place is a nightmare during busy eating hours or during holiday shopping season at the Town Center- however if you can stop in during the off hours, I would recommend it. The food was delicious, service great, and loved the selection of beers. Would have no problems coming back, and I will probably have to try some of that pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=160,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8320000000000003,3.1600000000000006

Came here with a friend and sat at the bar. We ordered drinks and food. We started with Appetizers which were the Thai stuffed chicken wontons, buffalo stuffed chicken wontons and the spinach stuffed mushrooms. The starters were very good, probably the best thing of the night. So we then order our dishes, I had the 8 ounce sirloin with white cheddar mash and a wedge salad, and my friend ordered the chicken and shrimp Jambalaya. My wedge salad came out before the main dishes and it was delicious. Our dishes show up and I immediately cut into my steak to see if it was cooked right and it was but after tasting it I wanted to spit it out! It had to be the most bland, non flavorful piece of crap I have ever tasted. I had to slather it in A1 sauce just to be able to eat it. My white cheddar mash was so dry and stiff that you could probably carve out a face into it! Its sad because the white cheddar mash used to be my favorite side when I first started coming here and it was good back then.  My friend took a couple bites of the Jambalaya and suddenly stopped eating, Told me to taste It, so I tried it and it was horrible. The chicken tasted like it was frozen or had been soaked in water to long prior to cooking. We both agreed that it tasted like a ""Healthy Choice"" Microwaveable dinner plopped onto a plate and served with some overpowering spicy sauce. My friend had it remade with the sauce on the side and minus the shrimp, when the remade dish came out is when we noticed that the veggies in it looked pre-packaged and previously frozen, very unappealing to say the least. The skimpy amount of chicken was also now noticeable. The thick and excessive sauce was originally hiding that from us. Honestly, the only good thing about that dish was the rice. I didn't send my dish back, my friend originally didn't want to either because we had been out all day and haven't had anything to eat and we were very hungry at this point. The bar tender was really nice and did her best to appease us but the food just sucked and that of course is not her fault. Our tab was a little under 60 bucks for the two of us. I would suggest you take that 60 bucks and go somewhere else in town center to get a quality meal that you won't feel stupid paying 60 bucks for. Sadly my friends and I most likely won't return here again.

They have a pretty extensive menu but from the looks of it, pizza was their specialty.  FOOD: The deepdish pizza was not an authentic Chicago style deep dish. That didnt bother me because it was outstanding. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for an app and a small deep dish pizza. both were outstanding, perfect size.  PRICE: You don't have to break bank to eat here. Appetizer prices are reasonable and same with entrees.  BEER: They have almost every style beer that they brew themselves, plus all the major beer brands. I ordered their lager and then there ""award winning"" beer Grand Cru (Belgian Strong Ale). The Grand Cru did not disappoint. For under $6.00 i got a beer that is on the level with beer that i have paid $15.00+. Ordered it both times i went and will get a growler before I leave.  SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE: Service was okay. I've had better service and I've had worse. Good looking bar and decor.  BOTTOM LINE: Its worth going.

But I'm being stubborn and not doing so now because I'm hurt that they discontinued one of my favorite dishes - the blonde shrimp. Still, this restaurant gets the highest of four-star ratings from me for several reasons. First, I enjoy the wide array of beer, chocolate raspberry being my favorite. Second, I have never received bad service from this place and I've been there more than I've been to any other restaurant in Jacksonville ever (and that includes fast food spots). Third, as a huge NBA fan, a restaurant will always get extra points from me by keeping ESPN or NBAtv on the nearby televisions. It's the same reason why I gave Mellow Mushroom such high remarks. Finally, the place is spacious and clean and still gives me the ability to have an intimate dining experience with my beloved. I've noticed lately that they've changed some menu items, which really brings me a tear, but the Santa Fe spring rolls remain, one of my favorites.

When they arrived, I dived right in... the avocado was a little brown... but I figured since it was deep fried, that would probably happen) and I guess I should have read the description a bit more thoroughly. The chipotle in the roll just made it... so wrong. It was a slimy, peppery yucky mess, and don't even get me started on that sauce. Just no. Not a fan.... one and done.  The shrimp lettuce wraps, on the other hand, were pretty good! The shrimp had a nice spice to them, the wraps were fresh and crisp, and toppings were on point.

We were promptly seated and our drink order was taken quick. We knew we wanted an appetizer so we went ahead and ordered the green chili fries with carnitas. They were pretty good. At first I felt that they were lacking cheese but then my husband pointed out that all the cheese was melted and browned at the bottom making a crispy cheese layer that needed to be scraped to be eaten. If this doesn't sound appetizing to you then skip this app but my husband and I like crispy cheese so we enjoyed it. We then ordered out entrees and I got the ribeye with white cheddar mashed potatoes and the tomatoe bisque soup. The soup was very tasty and creamy. When it was brought out I was asked if it was hot enough. I seriously said to the guy ""meh, it's okay"" but before I could even finish my sentence with ""it could use more"" the guy was dashing off. I let it go because my husband was fine with it but when I think of soup I think of something hot and steamy! Which this soup was not.  The ribeye at first glanced looked like this preachers piece of meat that did not look appetizing at all when brought out. The picture I took doesn't even do it justice with how ugly it was but I figured, oh well. Then I cut into the steak and it was well done! Heck no because I had ordered medium. The weird thing was that half was medium and the thinner half was well done. One of the servers did promptly come back and ask how everything was and I mentioned the weird steak and how it was cooked and she was about to grab the whole plate when I said that I would prefer she just bring me a small steak to replace the piece that was overcooked because by this point i was so hungry and my husband would have been eating alone. I also knew it would take time to get a whole new plate and by that time, then I would have been eating alone.  They did do as I asked and the steak that I ate was pretty tasty. Maybe a bit heavy handed on the salt and seasoning but it was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes were very smooth and actually tasted like white cheddar. My husbands burger looked very appetizing and he said it tasted delicious. He also got the fried replaced with broccoli which was perfectly cooked. By the time we were almost finished eating, my new steak with mashed potatoes and all arrived. It was much more than I expected because it was a whole brand new plate! I have to say well done to BJ's because they could have just brought out what I expected of a piece of steak but instead they exceeded my expectations. On to the salted caramel pizzookie!

37,Amy S.,"Jacksonville, FL",1496,1714,17389.0,3.0,2014-11-29,"Came here with a large party and had quite the ordeal getting a table large enough to seat all of us.  There seemed to be a lot of confusion between the hostess and the servers as to what to do with us.  I finally stopped a manager and suggested an empty area and pushing all the tables together.  You'd think they could have figured that out on their own. It was later at night, so by the time we were all seated, the restaurant was starting to clear out.  We had just one server, but she did a pretty good job.  I wish she would have been a little more attentive towards the end of the meal.  I had to ask another server walking by to go find her so my friend could order a dessert. As for the food, I ordered just a regular bacon cheeseburger.  I was terribly disappointed.  It was dry and the bun wasn't very soft.  I didn't even eat half of it.  The rest was brought home and eventually thrown out.  Sucks, because I was really craving a good burger.   The reason I gave  3 stars is because hubby really enjoyed his meal of jambalaya.  He said it's some of the best he's had.  I did give it a taste, but I have a very sensitive palate and just one bite lit my mouth on fire.  Hubby did warn me though... I should have listened!  :D The highlight was the dessert my friend ordered, and another reason for 3 stars rather than 2.  I don't recall the exact name of it, but it was a salted caramel something or another.  OMGosh!  It was sinfully delicious!  I would come back here again just to order that dessert! Because hubby loved his entree so much and I loved the dessert so much, I'm sure we'll be back again.  Hopefully, next time I'll be able to find something more to my liking than that pitiful excuse for a burger.   So, BJs will get one more shot with me.  If they strike out again, I definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=20,2.76,3.0,3.0,2.9560000000000004,2.9040000000000004

95,Tom B.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",322,346,26.0,3.0,2015-01-13,"BJ's is alright. It's a big noisy chain restaurant outside of Town Center near Costco. The food is pretty good. I kind of think of it as a poor man's Cheesecake Factory. It weighs in around the same number of calories per dish and amount of sodium you'll take in eating most things on the menu (off the charts hombre.) If you are planning on drinking, you'll want to know the beer is expensive (and you probably will need something to wash down your salty appetizers.) One of the cheapest things you can find is a Dos Equis for $5.25 a pint, and the prices go up from there for equally mediocre brews. They brew their own beer here, but they aren't particularly appetizing. Entrees are all over the place. The pasta is ok and the burgers are not bad. The pizza is alright. I had a ribeye last time that was actually pretty good. It was probably overseasoned, but it was cooked to temperature perfectly and was a decent deal at $20 with two sides. Overall, I can't say I really like this place but it's not bad. The menu is big, so they will have something for everyone. Having said that, I don't think the quality is in line with the price point.

It was my first time here and I wanted to stop in just never really had an excuse to. I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try all the great-looking food! Their happy hour is the best because it's half off all their appetizers with great drink specials and the best part is the appetizers a full portions! I wanted to try everything so it helped I was hungry. I had to order the calamari because I'm such a fan of it and I have to try everywhere I go. It was so tender and the seasoning of the batter was delicious you didn't even need any sauces to enjoy it even though the lemon aioli that came with it was phenomenal! I also tried the BLT salad that was so yummy with fresh bacon and egg, blue cheese with a tangy vinaigrette that complimented it So wonderfully with the fresh spinach. I also ordered the Thai wings that were cooked perfectly with this sweet yet spicy sauce they were very addicting but as you can see I ordered too much so there's always leftovers which is great. My friend ordered mozzarella sticks to start and they were so flavorful they did not seem like they were frozen the crust was seasoned and a nice crunch to reveal the Ooey gooey hot mozzarella inside she also ordered for dinner the deep dish cheese pizza that I'm definitely going to have to try next time as much as I love Pizza Hut it kind of put them to shame it was a nice crust buttery outside with fresh toasty cheese on top and you can tell the cheese is a high quality cheese .I also enjoyed a great margarita with my meal.

We asked for more chips thinking they would come right out but then we didn't see our server again for 15 minutes at which time we were told the chips were being made from scratch(you know, grind the corn, process it into chip shape, and fry). Eventually a basket of greasy chips was delivered.  This restaurant is just another chain along the same lines as Applebee's and Chili's the difference being the higher prices for the same food.

The low point of the evening was the pizza.  Yuck!  However they cooked the deep dish pizza was a let down.  The crust was way too moist and soggy.  The crust did not taste like quality baked bread; almost had a chemical taste.  The sauce and cheese were very lackluster.  The pepperoni had almost no flavor which was a shame.  The diced tomatoes on top were okay.  No joke, I have had better flavor from a frozen costco kirkland pepperoni pizza, which is very very sad.

108,Brittany C.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,34,1.0,2.0,2015-09-24,"I just got back from a dinner party here to celebrate my best friends birthday. I have to say, I am completely shocked and unhappy with the experience we all had.  We had a very large party. 17 of us and a reservation was made. When I first called to make the reservation, there was absolutely no problem. I even had to call back and add more people, they were completely fine with it.  Since we had such a large party, there were two waiters that were taking care of us. One waitress, I believe her name was Tasha, was absolutely great! She busted her butt helping our table and accommodating us. Plus, she was super sweet! However, the other waiter that was assigned to the other side of our table was just awful. (I did not get his name) When I first got there and sat down, it took him 30 minutes to even acknowledge me and I had to wave him down just to give him my drink order. Instead of all of our food coming out at the same time, one side of the table got their food and the other side waited almost 30 minutes to get theirs. Two people in our party that had ordered beers and had to wait 45 minutes for another round. One couple ordered an appetizer and it didn't even come out until after they were almost done with their meal. I also brought a birthday cake for all of us to eat and that took 30 minutes to get to our table as well. Tasha helped a lot with that though and went got the cake, plates and forks for us so it wasn't that big of a hassle thanks to her. The manager did come out and apologize, but it was only to one person in the party that was unhappy with her meal. I told the manager what all had happened and he comped our drinks and the one appetizer that was ordered. I personally don't think that was the best that the manager could've done but at least it was something.  The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because Tasha was such a great waitress. If I ever go back,  I'll be asking to sit in her section because I know my table will be taken care of. Other than that, I cannot believe how ridiculous this evening was at BJ's. The food was good, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be back or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=100,3.2,3.15,3.15,2.472,3.17
155,Chris R.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,5,,3.0,2015-10-17,"For a vast selection of different beers ranging from Pale Ales to Dark Lagers, BJs is a wonderful place to go and sample different flavors of both domestic and imported drinks. So if you are looking for a good drink you are in the right place. If you are looking for good food however, keep looking. With a few exceptions including the pizookie and avocado egg rolls, there is nothing really worth writing home (or Yelp) about. My wife will normally get the Parmesan crusted chicken with a slightly addicting heavy cream-based lemon sauce that accompanies it, which she enjoys each time. My experience is a little different though, since I have yet to find any one dish that stands out to me as anything unique and delicious, I can't say we share the same opinion. Playing it safe, I ordered a jalapeño burger that tasted like any other burger I can get in a bar or at a Chilies for a little less. Thinking I shot too low, next time we went, I figured I would treat myself and ordered a steak cooked medium-rare, off of their dinner special menu. When it came to the table it looked like it had a nice char on the outside, and was cooked just above medium rare on the inside, yet again however, it seemed like a dish I could order any where else and expect the same quality at a lower price. I couldn't help but think about my cast iron skillet at home, and how only a few days before, it produced a beautifully prepared rib eye that any true carnivore would appreciate. So to reiterate, if you are looking for drinks, pizookies, or avocado egg rolls then you are in for a treat. If you want good quality entrées, then you will find a better steak at Outback and a better burger at BurgerFi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=140,3.2,3.17,3.17,2.636,3.182

70,Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",22,537,343.0,3.0,2015-10-21,"I was in town on business on two separate occasions, and since my hotel offered a shuttle, I chose to come here because I like craft beers and this was the only game in town. I came here on two consecutive nights one week and had a good experience. I came one night the following week and it was horrible.  The first two nights were great. Me and a co-worker came and sat at the high tops in the bar area and were taken care of. The first night, the draft beers were a little warm, but we were told it was because there was warm beer in the taps due to us being the first patrons of the night. They took the warm beers back and brought us cold ones, so all was well. The service was great. I chose salad both nights and they are the largest salads I have ever seen. I love large portions and always eat everything, but the ration of lettuce to toppings was way off: way too much lettuce and not much toppings.  My third visit was horrible. We made a reservation for 10 people at 6:30. We show up at 6:20 or so to try to get seated and order some drinks. Well, I guess they are fans of Seinfeld, because they ""know how to take the reservation, but they don't know how to hold the reservation. And let's face it, the holding of the reservation is the most important part."" So we had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get the table.  After being seated 10 minutes late, we wait another 10 minutes for a server, and then another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive. All told, we received our drinks about 35 minutes after we were supposed to be seated. The service was okay after that, a bit spotty, but I could tell the girl was working hard.  The food was okay, seemed to be a little greasy. I would recommend this place for one or two people sitting in the bar area, but I would NOT come back here to sit at a booth or with a group of people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=40,3.12,3.17,3.17,2.636,3.15

We arrived a little before 4 pm and though there were already several people in the bar area, but we did not see a server for a while. When we did see a few different servers walk by, they completely ignored us. Finally someone did come to take our drink orders. Happy hour for $1 off the beers is not the greatest happy hour special in town, but getting 1/2 price appetizers is a great deal. We went for the avocado egg rolls and the potato skins. Both came out hot and were pretty good so this was still the best part of our experience. When it came time to get the bill, we waited and waited and again could see no servers, not ours, not anyone.

29,Patricia L.,"St. Augustine, FL",259,244,1445.0,5.0,2016-06-10,"We love BJ's!  We love the atmosphere, the menu, the wait staff and the prices!  This place is huge, so even when the parking lot looks full...you can probably still get a table.  If not, enjoy a drink at the massive bar! We normally try things from the Small Bites Menu since we normally only need something small when we go there.  Everything is delicious.  Our personal favorite is the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts.  I love Brussel sprouts anyway, but to take a perfectly healthy item and make it so ""apply to the thigh good"" is amazing!  Even if you don't like these normally...give them a try, you'll get addicted! On our last visit we ate a little larger than normal.  My husband had a piadina sandwich with fries and our son had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon sandwich...both were absolutely delicious!  I, however, decided to ask the waiter what he recommended since I couldn't decide.  He said his favorite was the Lemon Thyme Chicken, so I decided to give it a go with extra sauce on the side (just something I do).  It sounded yummy.  We all have different taste buds.  To me, it wasn't bad, just not good, nor tasty.  Something in it was terribly overwhelming...yes, it had thyme it, but something else was like ""WHOA"" or perhaps the combination with all the bell pepper.  I was hungry so I ate some, but it just got to be too much.  I'm glad I got extra sauce on the side since the dish itself didn't seem to have much on it.  The sauce was lovely, but the main dish...not so much.  I was able to dip my chicken in the sauce to make it taste better at least, but I lost my appetite and stopped eating.  I just couldn't do it.  I won't order it again obviously and it certainly wasn't worth marking them down star wise.  All I can say is, if you don't like those thanksgiving type spices (or whatever it is) with a lot of bell pepper...avoid!  I like those things, but this dish is over the top. The wait staff seems to be near perfect or as perfect as you can get.  They seem to have that perfect dance down to make sure you are never on empty drink wise.  And they don't come to see how your meal is when your mouth is full.   OK...drum roll...they give a uniformed discount and they have a free rewards program.  Both are reasons alone to return again!  Of course we'll be back...we love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts too much to not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=20,2.56,3.05,3.05,2.836,2.8539999999999996

After a long night, the girls and I landed in BJ's because (to be frank) they were the only ""open kitchen"" option after 11pm on a Tuesday night in the Town Center. But once we were seated and settled, BJ's began to blow our minds a little!  Free ""garlicky"" knots served hot and fresh outta' the oven with softened butter? --Don't mind if I do! And we did... two rounds of it! I ordered a burger and fries and split it with a friend. It was pretty darn delicious and the fries where hinging on a truffle-like situation. Effect: Raised brows all around!  Lastly, as we were celebrating a birthday, Paige (our sweet server) offered us a free ""cookie a la mode"" dessert-- but of course not the Strawberry Beignet, which is my FAVORITE!

I said they could put their orders in thinking a salad should not take that much longer.  My co-workers got their food and the fries were cold. One of them got the lettuce wrap but it was mainly vegetables and not much chicken. 20 minutes later the server said the salad would be a couple more minutes because they made the first one wrong.

23,Skyler W.,"Jacksonville, FL",43,53,248.0,4.0,2016-12-06,"What can I say about BJ's other than if you're looking for a good place for happy hour, this is a pretty decent one to check out. Now while I do not believe their regular prices for their appetizers are warranted, their prices for the same food come happy hour is kind of a steal. I mean, being able to get four different standard sized apps (and the portions aren't too shabby) for almost less than $20 is no laughing matter. And their drink options during happy hour are pretty good too. Please note though, they make a strong rum and coke. By that I mean it's gotta be like 2/3 or 3/4 rum.  I love a good plate of potstickers and BJ's does a pretty decent job. Their Chicken Pot Stickers come with a garnish of carrots and scallions, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and a side of soy dipping sauce.  Along with that I also have a weakness for an Ahi Tuna app; while BJ's doesn't make my favorite version of this, it's also not my least favorite. The chunks of ahi grade tuna and avocado constitute my favorite part of the dish, while the bed of cabbage and dressing mixture along with onions and tomatoes it comes with, I could do without. There are also chips to go with it to scoop it onto, but I find these at times to be ineffective.  ****If you're looking for an appetizer that won't let you down (from my experience) try the California club flatbread. Tomatoes, mozzarella, bacon, chicken, avocado, and garlic aioli drizzled across the top. Never a disappointment and even better the day after as leftovers. It's literally over a foot long.  I recently tried their White Peach Margarita and let me tell you, that is a drink to come back to. I can't even remember what was in it. But if you're looking for a fruity drink that masks the amount of alcohol you're consuming, get that one. I can't even say it tasted that much like peach. Maybe more so like strawberry. But still delicious. I'd get it again. And again. And again.  Happy hour is Monday to Friday 4-7.

28,Britney J.,"Jacksonville, FL",71,73,488.0,3.0,2016-12-07,"BJ's, BJ's, BJ's. What can I say about BJ's? Honestly, I have been coming here for a while and have a huge soft spot for this place for two reasons: 1. We share the same initials 2. BJ's introduced me to the concept of happy hour. BJ's used to be my go to happy hour spot; not because their happy hour drinks are all that great, but because their appetizers are half price. Their specialty drinks are killer, though. I recently had a drink that's a cross between a strawberry daiquiri and a piña colada (I can't remember the name of it right now). Whooo! It was great. The specialty drinks aren't a part of happy hour, though, so I stay away from them for the most part unless I'm in the mood.  One thing I always say about BJ's is that I'm no fan of their entrees (they're overpriced and nothing exceptional flavor wise), but their appetizers during happy hour are pretty good. I've tried the majority of their appetizers. Their wings are pretty standard, yet still tasty. Their calamari is a definite pass for me. I used to love BJ's calamari a few years back, but somewhere along the line, they must have changed the ingredients of their batter because it is seriously lacking flavor every single time I've ordered it lately. My go-tos now are the California Club flatbread, (which I will admit is genuinely delicious and I'm never dissatisfied with it) and the ahi tuna poke. I'm a sucker for tuna poke, and I think I was actually introduced to it for the first time via BJ's. I will say, however, that the last 2-3 times I've ordered the tuna poke, I've been disappointed with it. It seems that it's going the way of their calamari; continuously lacking flavor. I didn't even finish it last time, which is rare for me and tuna (excuse the pun). Their pizookie dessert is always amazing, though! It's a piping hot cookie topped with ice cream. Simple but tasty. I'd eat a pizookie every day if I could. Okay, maybe not every day. My waistline doth protest.  The value at BJ's happy hour can't be beat. You can get full size appetizers for around 5 dollars apiece. Beware though! Happy hour is crazy crowded from about 5:30 until the very end at 7. You may have to stand for a bit and wait for someone to leave before you can scoop up a booth or high chair table. Service at BJ's is also hit or miss. Most of the time it's satisfactory, but sometimes they can get distracted or short with you during the really busy times of happy hour. I had an absolutely horrid experience at BJ's once and I sent them some pretty scathing feedback about it. Seriously, it was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant ever. They ended up giving me a gift card and the manager called me personally to apologize. I truly appreciate and respect them for that, and I really don't mention this incident when I tell people about BJ's because they did such a good job righting their wrongs in that case. The experience actually ended up as a positive in the end. All in all, I know I'll return to BJ's because it's like that dependable cardigan in your closet that goes with everything.

62,Madders M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",2,37,9.0,1.0,2017-01-18,"First off let me say that we have been going to BJs for years and we absolutely love it. So last Saturday night we had a date night with 2 of our friends and decided to go to BJs again (we had our last date night there too, the menu is just so big it's always the best bet) so we got to BJs around 7:40 pm and we walked it to about four hostesses at the stand and not one of them greeted us. I had to politely interrupt their personal conversation to put our name in, she said ""40 minutes what's your phone number"" .. nothing else. So whatever, we've all been annoyed at work and had bad days so we brushed it off, I noticed there was open seating at a bar table and let the hostess know that she could take our name  off of the list because we chose to sit at the ""first come first served"" in a bar booth. Well, we may as well have waited the 40 minutes because that's how long it took to even get a menu. ""A"" menu, as in 1 was dropped off at the table with a comment of ""we are out menus"" which is fine but how about a ""hi sorry we are short on menus I'll bring one right over when I can"" anyway, like I said we all have bad days. Our server, I can't remember his name, slender blonde guy, was not happy that we sat in his section. It took a good 30 minutes to get our drinks. Then after that, a good 40-45 minutes just to get our appetizers. Mind you, we like to enjoy ourselves when we go out, appetizers, alcohol, main entree, and desert and we tip very well. We are a waiters dream. And I can say that because I was a waitress for many years. Anyway, our drinks were always empty, and we had to ask for refills that took 30 minutes. The appetizers were cold when they came out, we had the calamari and wings and the other couple had stuffed mushrooms. All cold. Then 20 minutes after that our pizza came out. I couldn't believe what they placed in front of me. I took a picture, and not for instagram, but to put on my bad yelp review. I could not believe that a cook or server/food runner would deem that acceptable. I am not kidding you, we ordered a half cheese/pepperoni pizza. One half literally was nothing but crust, the other had a few sprinkles of cheese and some crusted pepperoni on the crust. It was like a blind man made the pizza, no sauce no cheese, nothing. I couldn't believe it. And in top of that, it was COLD! Our waiter walked over and asked how everything was, pretty frustrated at this point I said actually not so happy, would you look at this pizza. He even looked at it, wide eyed and said ""yeah, wow, that's bad"" he said we can make another one. By that time I was over it, we had already been there for an hour and a half and I wasn't about to wait 40 min more. I politely declined and told him that we would be fine. I ate one slice and was so dissaponted. I am so used to the amazing flavor of your pizza and was truly craving it. Plus it was the last night before my diet so I was extra mad! Anyway, he said he would have his manager come over and we told him it's really not a big deal and he insisted. Well, the manager never came over and then he swung by and said ""I'm going to go ahead and take $10 off your bill"" I'm sorry, $10!? How about the uneaten pizza gets taken off our bill!? We didn't even eat it and it couldn't even be considered a ""pizza"" I was so shocked. After all we ordered, we got a $10 comp. I'm not asking for a free meal, but seriously, take the item off that we didn't eat... anyway, I didn't get to order a pazooki because at that time it was so late and everyone was over it. I just want you to know what a horrible expierence we had, service & food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=40,2.84,2.96,2.96,2.5320000000000005,2.912

7,Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1856,948,3626.0,3.0,2017-04-09,"BJ's is a good place to grab a bite to eat when you're casually dressed and looking for good, solid, consistent food. Having only tried their appetizers, pizzas, and pizookies when I lived in California, I was actually surprised by how expansive the menu was. They have quite the variety of entrees and even a lighter fare section that has lower calorie options. Sitting out on the patio on a beautiful weekend day, we decided to order burgers - the appetizer sliders with cheese and a side of fries and the hickory brisket and bacon burger. We tried the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and the pizookie trio with monkey bread, ghirardelli chocolate, and chocolate chip flavors. The food was all average at best. The brussel sprouts were very underwhelming and they tasted nothing like we expected given the name. There was a light drizzle of some sauce on top that was neither sweet nor spicy. Our waitress found their only bottle of sriracha sauce and she brought it out for us. The brisket burger was actually quite tasty, and much better than the sliders. I added some barbecue to the sliders and to the fries, which made both of them better. I basically only go to BJ's for the pizookie and the trio did not disappoint! Although these were a little softer and gooier than I remember them being, they were still really good! The monkey bread was a unique pizookie offering but it was really cinammony and tasty. The portions were very generous and we ended up packing half of our meal to go. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. She even offered to-go refills on our sodas. I took her up on it as their black cherry is really good!  The next time I'm craving a pizookie I'll be back.

Loved the mix of quinoa with brown rice. I got a side of their peanut spicy sauce. It was delicious with the meal. Gave it a kick I wanted. Food was filling.  They make their own beer. My fav is Totonka stout. Hubs enjoys the Nutty Brunette.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I don't think I saw anyone not working. Our waitress kept our drinks topped off.   Favorite part is getting on the wait list before going there on their app. I can order more stuff if I wanted to, order to go, and I can pay from my phone. Not having to wait for the waitress to come back. Atmosphere is good from couples to large groups.  ------------ So I need to update. Although the food was good for me.

8,Matt J.,"Jacksonville, FL",34,117,106.0,2.0,2017-05-04,"Great beer, but there needs to be a change to almost everything else at BJs.  The main problem for me with this restaurant is that every time I go, be it day or night, I have to wait so long for my food. I have been a handful of times and it may just be bad luck, but I always wait forever to receive anything that I order. One time I ordered a chicken pasta dish which I waited some time for and it didn't have any chicken in it. The waitress offered to bring me some grilled chicken to put in it, but there was no telling how long that would take so I just ended up eating my pasta without. One other thing is that the food seems pretty inconsistent as far as how well prepared each dish is. I've had really good meals and then come back to have the exact same entree be terrible.  Sorry I had to get the bad out of the way to justify the rating. The good thing is that the in house beers aren't that bad and the service is usually very accommodating as if they know the wait for the food is going to be longer than desired. Some dishes are tasty like the avocado egg rolls and the pizzookie, but I haven't found a consistent entree that I would get more than once.  I don't mean to be blunt but there are better choices just a block down the road in any direction.

When the food did come, mine was made wrong. They made me a new salad but the second time the chicken looked pink and undercooked. I would have sent it back but I was starving and did not want to wait for another salad to be made so I just did not eat the chicken. Another dish at the table came out with a hair on it.

As we were leaving, we noticed handwritten signs on the door saying the restaurant was experiencing power outages..... we sure didn't experience any during the hour and 45 minutes that the two of us were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=40,3.08,2.84,2.84,,2.9360000000000004

11,Victoria A.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,8,12.0,5.0,2017-11-01,"I loved how doughy the pizza was, I got the buffalo chicken and the celery mixed well with the texture of the pizza. The flavor wasn't too spicy, it had the right amount of flavor. If you happen to come here, you should get one of their Pazookis, I got the Salted Caramel and it was one of their more favored dishes amongst the customers. I got to try a bite of the monkey bread one and that was delicious and sweet. Now if you are going to try one of their original drinks and you like tarty fruity flavors, then I would get the berry burst cider. It has the perfect sweetness to it and tastes almost like sour strawberry juice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville,3.08,2.84,2.84,,2.9360000000000004
20,Nicole P.,"Westside, Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-10,"Decided to stop by for Veterans Day and get a discounted meal. Wasn't worth the hour and a half wait though. Overall service was slow and after being seated didn't meet our server until 10-15 mins later. Food was mediocre. Ribs were alright but mojitos had little to no alcohol in them whatsoever. Tasted like sprite and super syrupy, almost too sweet to drink. A waste of a $10 drink..  Honestly if you want good food and good service in that area just do yourself a favor and go right down the street to either Chuy's or the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=20,2.96,2.84,2.84,,2.888
19,Tom C.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,10,,5.0,2017-11-11,"Veterans Day. A freebie. Never been there, give it a try. Crowded, 20 minute wait but predicted to the minute. Wife had CHERRY CHIPOTLE GLAZED SALMON; I had BLONDE® FISH 'N' CHIPS. Both were excellent. The bed of roasted asparagus fire-roasted red pepper, tomato, spinach and couscous with the salmon was very tasty. The batter on my fish fell between crispy and crunchy, excellent. I did come up a bit short on the tartar sauce; ask for more. Only disappointment was they were out of the TURMERIC-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER.

We all ordered cheeseburgers and it took over 2 hours for us to get our food. Our waiter came by TWICE for refills and he low key had an attitude the whole time, which i didn't understand because we weren't asking for much at all. Anyways, we get our food and NOTHING was right. They overcooked them all, some of them didn't even come with cheese...mind you, we all ordered the same exact thing. BUT, we talked to the manager because we were truly confused about the service and wait because there weren't that many people in the restaurant. She was very nice and gave us half off for our meal and gave us free dessert (reason i am giving 2 stars).

2,Michael R.,"Neptune Beach, FL",355,262,1273.0,4.0,2017-11-20,We came here for veterans day. This was our first time to this location. The outside and inside appear to be kept in top quality condition. Despite the line of people waiting for seats upon our arrival we were seated within ten minutes. The menu is a bit costly.  The food we ordered was amazingly prepared. The recipe they use for foods we ordered had perfect amount of flavor. The portion was a bit low for the cost.  We were only here for veterans day. The service was above and beyond excellent.  If you are looking for a nice meal at st. John's town center we recommend you try this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville,3.04,2.87,2.87,,2.9380000000000006

24,Angelo M.,"Jacksonville, FL",150,10,6.0,2.0,2017-12-04,"An all around bad experience. I placed my order via the app to try to cut down on time. However, that proved to be more of a hassle then simply calling in my order! I used the app and tried to pay for my order on it, but it didn't allow me to pay after placing my order. I went into the restaurant for assistance and none of the servers were knowledgeable on how to help me navigate the application. Once I figured out how to pay, the manager shows up and gave a somewhat decent answer as to why the bill wasn't showing up on the application. From there, I had to wait an additional 20 minutes before my food came out, totaling just short of an hour in waiting. Once I finally received my food, it was completely wrong. To add insult to injury, the server who bought it out had a bad attitude because I requested to have it remade. There was no manager to be found and instead of looking to provide good service, all of the employees were busy cleaning up their stations instead of seeing to the needs of the patrons. I like bjs pizza and really like the Oreo pizzokie; However, I don't know if I'll be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville?start=20,3.04,2.85,2.85,,2.926
0,Niko T.,"San Francisco, CA",39,3,,3.0,2017-12-23,"Sat night happy hour at BJ's? The 10% BAC signature Gand Cru beer is well made and worth the flavor. Not my fav but well done for the style. The fries are great, duh. The sriracha brussel sprouts fantastic. I dont know for sure, but you probably need to eat more veggies anyways. Totally doable well roasted with spicy mayo right?  SOS leave the sliders alone. My slider minis looked like mishappen elephant  heads. What part of a hamburger is supposed to be crunchy? My pickles looked like Juan beat them out of a canned pinata and I don't even think he works there.  Fortunately that 10% signature Grand Cru had a twin and my yelp fingers work. By the way it's seasonal and said to sell out fast, FYI.  So its been a long 10 day week before Christmas and I'm way out of town on business. I've been working inside Jacksonville FL Costco. BJs is a close opportunity for a hot meal before a night in a crappy hotel. The only gettin lucky for me on this Sat night is Happy Hour  10pm-12am.  As much as I love the idea of 1/2 price menu I have the strong suspicion thats when the old burger comes out.  #1/2pricehappyhour=1/2qualityhamburger #happyhoureintkosherandimnotjewish This chain restaurant is sort of a good idea to offer local pub attitude without all the trouble of actual neighbors making eye contact over the 4 channel sports screen.  The staff does there best to satisfy the high expectations of the under tipping crowd so God bless them.  It's worth a shot when your high in spirit and low in benjamin's. Just don't expect too much, leave a good tip and be glad you have a job.  #donthatetheplayerhatethegame",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville,3.0,2.87,2.87,,2.9220000000000006
1,Kymberly C.,"Jacksonville, FL",99,38,6.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"This location is appalling, I felt like I needed a hot shower after the experience. After dragging my husband around IKEA for 4 hours we were starving & needed a glass of wine to settle our retail nerves. My husband loves BJ's & tho I'm not a fan I agreed as a reward for purchasing an entire new bedroom set for the Mother In Law. The hostess first tried to seat us in the very last booth that has only one booth side & a normal chair on the other regardless of the fact there was not a single other booth occupied. I requested to sit in a normal 2 top booth, we get all settled in & unfortunately the way the sun positioned through the large windows I could see what looked like 3 years worth of shmegma caked onto the wooden partition beside me. I moved my purse away from the wall, totally disgusted. The women's room was filthy, a huge box of toilet paper lazily opened & left on the floor after being restocked, the floor sticky on the bottom of my shoes, husband commented that men's room was no better. The server took quite a while to greet the table, in fact we had enough time to decide on our drinks & food by the time he introduced himself to us. We each ordered a glass of wine, another long wait for the wine. Ok, no biggie, we're just happy when they finally arrive.  Then we wait. And we wait. And we wait some more. In this time we don't see the server, no manager has come by to address the wait. Finally after probably 45 minutes the food arrives & it's apparent my two small plates were waiting under the window for my husbands tacos by the film of ""skin"" over my meatballs & the the liquified beets. Annoying.  At this point we order another round of wine, the server comes by with his little carafes & to my horror he pours the refills into our wine glasses incorrectly! Luckily my glass was bone dry but my poor husband was left with a chardonnay-riesling blend that he couldn't even stomach to finish. We didn't even bother addressing this with the server, just paid our bill & agreed that would be our last BJ's experience for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville,3.0,2.84,2.84,,2.9040000000000004

5,Renda H.,"Jacksonville, FL",106,161,267.0,3.0,2018-01-07,Okay I have to say this was not a good experience... I went to this location last night for dinner yes it's Saturday and kind of busy but it wasn't that busy! the wait was only 15 minutes. We were lucky to get a table in the bar to take advantage of the special half price appetizers and mini pizza that's only offered in the bar area during football games. My real complaint is with the kitchen the waitress was pretty good and the only thing she did wrong was not make sure that she put in the appetizers to come out first we didn't say anything and she didn't ask so I forgive her for that one... but when we did ask her for the garlic knots to go ahead and come out since we were hungry and it had been a long time after we placed our order! she brought them out but they were still frozen in the middle! and there was a piece of plastic stuck to one of them! so obviously the kitchen was not on point then the rest of our order came out together which was the chicken potstickers pretty good and the fried artichokes very good also the chicken bacon mini deep dish pizza was dry on top and soggy on the bottom and on my great white pizza they forgot the mushrooms and it was barely warm so she very kindly asked if I wanted to have a new one i agreed... when it finally came out it was at least better than the first one and then she gave us a free Pizookie (we asked) and a huge discount on our check so it wound up being okay but still I was disappointed enough to have to write this review! And to top it all off it was freezing in there the whole time they had the AC on and it was like 40 degrees outside so that was not pleasant either...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-jacksonville,3.12,2.86,2.86,,2.9640000000000004
