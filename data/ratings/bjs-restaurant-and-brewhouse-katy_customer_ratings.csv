157,Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699.0,3.0,2014-04-16,"This is a chain restaurant.  Maybe because I am a non drinker, I cannot rate this place higher than 3 stars.  I would like to, but there isn't anything truly outstanding about the food.   Because I part of the electronic rewards program, I got an invitation in the mail asking me to try out their new location quite close to my house.  Your only options were either lunch or dinner time slots, and by the time I called, only lunch time was available.  They said bring 3 guests, so I hit up my fellow yelpers that work in the Katy area.  Latisha P., Janine A and Shawn S. were the guinea pigs with me! This place is very nicely decorated with many screens that were turned to sports.  They told me that since it is a family environment, they will not show fighting pay per views in the establishment.  Since the place has yet to be open to the public, the place is obviously extremely clean. We are there to make sure the waiters can handle the Katy rush that happens whenever a new restaurant opens its doors.  We had a preselected menu and we all shared the dishes.  For lunch was a small gourmet five meat pizza with added chicken for a 6 meat dish.  Next were seafood tacos, then Cajun pasta with shrimp added and then a BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  They even had a Pizookie trio for desert. All in all, the food was just okay.  The pizza wasn't outstanding, the pasta could have used seasoning in the actual pasta and not so much along the side of the plate for decoration, and the tacos were just tacos to me.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was slightly tasty, but nothing to write to yelp about...even though I just did.  The dessert trio was tasty, but I am a sugar fiend so that does not count.  Even my orange cream soda was just okay.  One person said it taste like soap, and asked for another carbonated beverage instead. I heard that their wings are really good, so one day I will go get some from them.  All in all, looking at the amount of money we would have paid for this meal, I don't think the portion size and value is worth that type of money.  I do know that you should sign up for their e-club and wait for food deals to come to your email to ensure a fair value for average food.  Give them a try, but don't have your expectations too high...it is a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=40,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

Came here on their dress rehearsal free meals for a cause.  I ordered the orange cream soda.  Frankly, I found it utterly disgusting, tasted like soap to me.  We all split the pulled pork sammich, 5 meat pizza, shrimp tacos, and shrimp/chicken fettucini pasta dish.  The food was OK, nothing rave worthy.  I will say I enjoyed the pizza much more at this location than the aforementioned SL one.  So s/o to Katy BJ's for making me KINDA see what the rave is about. We topped the meal off with the pizookie trio with the double chocolate, white chocolate macadamia and the salted caramel...I would say the macadamia was the best of the 3!  Good dessert but I have a sweet tooth that won't quit so it doesn't take much. I think BJ's is a cool spot with the full bar and big screen TVs but their food has always needed work to me.  The service was extra nice, as expected for a new establishment...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=40,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

Then the presentation of the food was not all that great. Felt like I got ripped off. I ordered freis and a burger...

Service was very slow, but friendly.  The food took forever to come. My wife and daughter had Mahi Mahi and Salmon and they were both dry and over cooked. They never brought the extra sauce for the fish that they asked for. Hamburgers were decent but they couldn't seem to bring me enough Chipotle sauce for my jalapeño burger. They would only give me a tiny side of it each time I asked! It's still a good place and I am sure it will get better otherwise I won't be coming back.

The wait time was estimated at 30min, we ended up waiting for about an hour.  Once seated we ordered appetizers, they took 45min to bring out lettuce wraps. Before the appetizers arrived we ordered our meal, my daughter ordered mini burgers (the lettuce was completely wilted). I would have been embarrassed to bring that out of the kitchen.  They brought 1 of the two pizzas we ordered and it was completely wrong!  The other pizza came out shortly and it was so mushy on the inside(undercooked).  30min later they brought out the correct pizza.  With all these complications the waiter was very polite but the other service and the quality of food was beyond poor.  We eat out at least 12 times a week and this new restaurant is down the street from my home, unfortunately we will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=180,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

Several were larger parties. When I inquired, I was told they had reservations. And then it would only be another 10 minutes.  Finally after an hour of being told 10 more minutes and more people getting seated before us, I asked for the manager.  He apologized. I explained if we would have known it was an hour wait, we would have gone somewhere else. Especially because we had a 3 year old with us. He said he would take care of an appetizer for us.  After all that we were seated for 6 people with two sets of silverware. After asking for silverware twice, we finally just got our own. The service was extremely slow. Had to ask three times for ice because we had no ice in the tea. Food took thirty minutes to arrive at the table.  When we finally a check, we were charged for the appetizer. I waited to tell the sever, but after several minutes, I finally just took the check back to the manager and he took the appetizer off.

Our waiter took over five minutes to take our drink orders, ten minutes to get our drinks to us and even longer for beers. Our beers always took a long time. Our waiter blamed his fellow waitstaff for not running his beers for him. Every time a new round was brought out the pours were different. One time it looked as though someone had taken a big drink out of one.  Our food took over 30 minutes, my dish was cold, all other dishes were served on very hot plates (as though they were under a heat lamp) and my sons order was wrong.  We asked for a manager who came over and said he would buy us a round of beer - which we never got but were charged for.

46,Kar B.,"Katy, TX",21,13,113.0,2.0,2014-05-19,I took my daughter here on a Monday night about 7:20 pm. It was a special night because she received an award for Honor Roll on stage at her school that night.  We were seated right away. We ordered our drinks and they came right away. But after that things got real slow. Our waitress was nice but seemed to be spread very thin. We ordered a Pizza 16' to share. It took longer than normal. This was our 3rd visit here.  The pizza was not cut all the way thru so I had to cut it myself and the cheese was falling all off the pizza and did not have much sauce at all. With as long as the pizza took we did not want to send it back because we were hungry.  I knew that would take forever to get it correct.  It took forever for our waitress to come back to our table. When she did appear  we ordered the famous pizookie for our celebration.  It seemed like the cookie was not cooked enough. Kind of raw cookie dough.   So this visit was not up to par like before. I do believe they need more help and to cook the orders correctly. We are on a schedule on a school night and it took way too long to cook a pizza and an uncooked cookie. Really. The only good thing was the ice cream.

Thought happy hour prices were the ticket for us, a party of two at a hamster ball for 400 was our first impression.  In this type of crowd we usually head for the bar and can find two stools to squeeze in.  A staff person told us to sit in a booth in the bar area, pretty sure we should have been added to those waiting for an hour.  Noise level was not where you could order without yelling, conversation impossible, nice touch to watch ESPN.   Ordered, happy hour fried artichokes, $4.50, the Mexican spring rolls and sliders, $5.00 each.  The Colorado bulldog (bar slaughtered this and charged $8.00), chased it with a cosmo, meh, non beer drinkers, craft beers $4 until 7:00 p.m. When order was delivered no mustard or ketchup, but plastic bottles were bought out to the table, more purell required.  Asked for the check, $35 deposited and the staff person was polite and did refill our water glasses.

It was a dish I had at lunch and I knew what I was getting. Our party also ordered their flatbread pizza appetizer and all enjoyed. Maybe since it was during peak time the service was a little slow so I'll reserve that for another visit. At lunch service  was superb  My entree was their ribs which were just ok. They were not as good as the ones I had at Applebee's earlier this week, I also had a chili soup which was very good. In the end we had to wait a long time to receive my free birthday cookie with ice cream on top which was very delicious also so I guess it was worth the wait.

I have been to the B.J.'s in Sugarland several times and the location in League City several times without issue. Food and service at the locations has always been good. The new Katy location is NOT, I repeat Not what you would expect from B.J.'s. We were seated promptly. Ordered sweet tea to start and received unsweet. Asked server for sweet tea again and was told ""there is sweetener right in front of you on the table"". I asked ""do you serve sweet tea?"" Yes we do, he replied. Then please get us sweet tea. He did so begrudgingly. Went straight downhill from there. Had to ask for plates or anything else you would think is normally done (such as refills). We have been a B.J. rewards member for years. When we got home I went online and wrote a specific complaint. Was advised by a auto reply for comments would be addressed within two working days. When 5 working days had passed I wrote them again including my original email along with additional comments on how I was seeing a mirror image of customer care at the corporate level and the restaurant location had displayed. Once again received a reply that my comments had now been elevated to a ""Customer Care specialist"" and I would be contacted in 3 to 5 working days. You guessed it, it's been 7 days now and nary a word. Moral of the story is ""B.J.'s could care less"". Take your chances, the food may or may not be good, the service may or may not be acceptable and you may or may not have a nice dining experience.

The hostesses are all rude and very unprofessional. I had a party of 7 and waited for an hour for a table, they texted us at 8:40, we got to the host stand by 8:46 since we were waiting in line to show them our txt and they had given our table away. Calette was completely rude and as soon as we told her we needed to speak to a manager she tried to change her attitude. The manager, by the name of Bri was even worst than the hostess was, he was incompetent and did not even apologize for the inconvenience, he said that their ""window"" was 5 minutes and they gave the table away, didn't even say they would try to get us another table, NOTHING, u can tell this guy has no idea what good customer service should be, they must have been very desperate to give him a managing position. After finally getting sat, I ordered a spinach dip as a meal, which never came and the waiter simply said ""it was never made"" after half of my party was done with their meal...my friend ordered a medium rare steak which was completely burned, and another one of my friends ordered a hamburger with the bun being hard rock. The waiter, Andrew was completely careless about the situation & just said he was going to call his manager...Bri once again came by and when he was told what happened with our food and that we wanted to cancel the spinach dip and the burger, he simply said ""ok"", didn't offer anything, apologized, once again, NOTHING.

108,David H.,"Katy, TX",1,5,,1.0,2014-07-05,"Have been to other locations and this one is not the same. Service was bad and manager was useless.  Food was good but service all around was bad.  1) asked for a table of 8 on a Saturday around 5:30. BJ put us on the list but couldn't tell us how long the wait would be. The Manager had to be the one to tell us how long our wait would be, he never did. Also only 1 Manager on shift for a Saturday night. Waited ~15 minutes which wasn't bad just no communication from a manager or why a manager was needed to tell us how long the wait was.  2) tried to order one of the common beers on their tap list. They were out of that one and a few others. Learned later that they weren't out of the beer,  it was just that no one there knew how to change out a keg expect for the manager. Which again he was the only manager on shift and he was too busy to change out the keg.  3) ordered our kids' dinner at the same time ordering drinks. We ordered our food after ordering appetizer, about 10-15 min later.  Appetizer and salad came out. No kids food. Our food came out and still no kids food. We asked WTF. Waiteress said there was a mess up in the kitchen. We are pretty sure she just forgot to put the order in. Kids didn't get their meal till we were all done eating.  4) I had ordered a salad and it was finished sitting in front of me. When my entree came I had no where to put it on the table I picked up the plate to hold it while the server put the entree down. I am stuck holding the plate as the serve leaves. I had to get her attention to take the plate out of my hand.        5) to make it up to us the waitress said any desserts we ordered would be comped.  Kids ordered kids dessert and adults ordered theirs. When the bill came out only the kids desserts were comped.  They gave us four $5 coupons, and told both families could use one. We paid our tickets (2) only to then be told that only allowed one coupon could be used at a time. That was BS.  Overall, we spent close to two hours at this place and nothing went right.

175,Stuart D.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2014-07-13,"REVIEW BY FORMER BJ'S SERVER:  Dining date: 7/13/2014 at 12 am.  Preface: Yes, we ate very late. That is no excuse for poor service. If a restaurant is open, it should be functional.  Let me begin  with our VERY FIRST interaction with the staff. My girlfriend and I walk into the restaurant. The hostess doesn't acknowledge us at all. No greeting, nothing. Instead, she proceeds to grab menus with the most dreary frown that I've ever seen and ask ""So, two?"". Then she sluggishly proceeds to seat us at a 2 top that's only one part booth. Really? In the entire empty restaurant you can't even give us a whole 2 top booth?  Now, if you're not familiar with the duties of Hostess' interaction with guests you're in luck because I am here to demystify the incredibly difficult job of the under appreciated hostess...They are as followed:  SAY HELLO TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY CHOOSE YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. BE NICE TO THEM. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON THE GUEST SEES, SO LEAVE A LASTING FIRST IMPRESSION. And for the more advanced hostesses there's this super incredible technique: ASK THEM HOW THEY'RE DOING. Seriously, that's their only job when interacting with guests. As I said, I worked there. And I still work in restaurants. Their ONLY job is to be nice and seat the guest. SHE HAD ONE JOB....And she couldn't do it. She should be fired.  Table Service: Once seated by our lovely hostess, my girlfriend and I picked out what we wanted. We know the menu well, we didn't need time to look anything over. However, this kind establishment was generous enough to give us 10 minutes to decide what we wanted to drink. In other words: Nobody even stopped by the table to say ""Hey, I'm a bit busy, I'll be right back."" NOTHING! We were ready to leave at this point.  However, after 10 minutes(which is an abysmal excuse for service and is completely unacceptable by Bj's Corporate standards) we were greeted by Devan. Devan was the ONLY GOOD THING about this restaurant. I'll admit that I was a bit frustrated already but she handled it superbly. Yet, there's another twist. DEVAN WASN'T EVEN OUR SERVER! She was actually so fantastic that we tipped her instead of our server. This restaurant is lucky to have at least one competent server.   Now, you may be wondering why someone who wasn't our server is the one greeting us and taking our order. Remember, it's 12 am. At this point in the day, management has decisions to make. In order to cut costs, management sends every server home and only keeps on their VERY BEST SERVERS. These are the closers. These people are responsible for making sure everyone is helping to clean up the restaurant and take the remaining tables. Apparently our ACTUAL server was too busy to even stop by and show his face. Now I will say this-the place was fairly busy. But if our server was too busy then management made a very poor decision to place so much responsibility upon one person who is incapable of handling such a work load.  Fast forwarding another 10 minutes: Devan has brought our drinks, taken our order and brought our first course. WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN OUR SERVER. After a few astonishing moments, we are finally introduced to Tim. If you can even call it an introduction. Tim walks past us in a rush and faces us with his backside and says ""Everything good over here?"" No, Tim...Everything is not good over here. We then proceed to tell Tim that we would like Devan as our official server. To which Tim replies that she's already cut. Instead of apologizing for completely neglecting the people that are supposed to tip him, Tim proceeds to give me half-attempted excuses for why he hasn't been by. He even said that he chose Devan to delegate some of his responsibilities. First of all, that's not how you delegate responsibility. You don't make someone do EVERYTHING and not even stop by to say hi. Secondly, you don't give excuses, you apologize. If you'll recall, Tim is a CLOSER. Not to mention he has a badge that signifies his excellence as a server. This guy is LITERALLY the best this restaurant has to offer. And we saw him a total of 3 times the entire evening. Drinks were empty, plates weren't bussed. We notified Tim that our tip will still be going to Devan because she literally did 98% of the work.  The food was good. Bj's has very tasty food. But this was one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. EVER. Do yourself a favor and vote with your dollar so that these people learn how to run a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=160,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.244,2.0
43,Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",359,584,614.0,4.0,2014-07-22,"In the words of BJ's ""Wow, I love this place!"" is most certainly a true statement from my experience here!  I've been to BJ's before and knew they had an extensive menu--perfect for various taste and ages, but I still like to do my research before I take people out. Perusing the yelp reviews, BJ's had an average middle of the road rating. Basically, hit or miss.  Since this place is relatively new, I decided to give it a shot. So glad BJ's was a hit!  Our party of six arrived around 3 pm on a Saturday.  Parking lot was packed, so I decided to get out and see if there was a long wait for a table.  Wasn't a wait at all, so me, Mom, and my four nieces ranging from 4 to 14 piled out the car to get our eat on!  We were lead to a spacious corner of the restaurant that had a round table--perfect for me to keep an eye on the teeny tots and to keep them out of people's way since we had the adults on both ends of the booth. Of course, they had their moments crawling on the floor under the booth trying to recover crayons, but pretty mild behavior.  Once more, my teenage niece was able to watch all the sports to her heart's content on the many screens around the building. So far so good! As far as the food goes--I would advise anyone knowing that they are going to dine here to look at the menu online   so you won't be puzzled as to what to get.  I will say that I would pass on the spinach and artichoke dip--I've tasted better, plus it wasn't very big; split between six people  (three of them being under 10) we only had one good spoonful to share with a few chips.  Besides, your entree portion is so massive, you probably end up taking it home because you'll be full from eating the app.  Save room because the main dishes are a home run!  Mom and I decided on burgers and sandwiches respectively. She had the sliders--thick and well seasoned, cooked to her specs. Only thing is that the adult slider does not come with tomato--ask for it if you desire--no extra charge. I kind of wanting the chicken fried steak, but my experience at a different location made me apprehensive. I asked Jackie, our server,  to help me choose between it and the pulled pork sandwich. She emphatically exclaimed the latter. So glad I did! Massive bun with delicious, sweet, and moist pork lion topped with onion strings. I decided to make my sandwich even more towering and pile the crunchy coleslaw inside to experience a slew of textures for my taste buds. They were impressed--so much so that I barely ate half of the sandwich! Blame it on the fries--crunchy and golden brown with a soft interior. These fries were too delish to pass up and let get cold!   My oldest niece decided to get the Cajun pasta which has peppers in it versus the Fettuccine Alfredo. However, she did not want the tomato-based sauce. She subbed the Alfredo instead--without a charge--and still had a yummy dish with ample succulent shrimp folded into the pasta. She did ask for more Alfredo later on, but the flavors were there! Her drink selection, however, was a little of a miss. She initially decided to get the raspberry tea, but it tasted off--almost like it was going sour. Her second choice was the cream soda because they were out of regular root beer. Jackie convinced her that it was better than regular root beer, so she tried it. At first, she was excited about the new discovery, but she did not drink too much of it. I cannot recollect what her final drink selection was, but I think she would not have had to go through so much trial and error if what she really wanted was in stock.  What really impressed me was the the kids' menu. On the back of the activity page, there are three columns: main entree, side, and drink. Main entrees things such as mac and cheese, corn dogs, mini sliders, chicken tenders. Sides: fries--thin or steak fries, side salad, veggie plate, mash potatoes. We went with the chicken tenders and sliders for the kids paired with mash potatoes (one wanted cheese on hers, which was not an extra charge) and steak fries. When I saw their kids' plates, it almost looked like a meal for an adult! Way more than enough food for them to nibble on at the restaurant and for later on. Plus, the cups are too cool. They're clear plastic and come with a different neon colored straw that help the kids easily identify whose cup is whose. No more bickering on who has my cup at BJ's!!! Even though I was full, I had to make room for the pzookie!!! Chocolate chip cookie al la mode with ice cream on top!!! Only reason I shared it was because I could not eat it fast enough to keep the ice cream from softening the cookie. Everyone really enjoyed the rich and creamy taste of this desert, but  beyond the food, what really made our visit exceptional was our server Jackie. She was so attentive, punctual, and sweet. Gave her the biggest tip I can even remember giving a server because she was just that good!   A must try place in Katy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=80,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.576,2.12
232,Rashelle G.,"Abilene, TX",0,22,4.0,3.0,2014-07-23,"I had a very similar experience to Stuart, however mine was at 11 a.m. on a Wednesday and my nephew and I were the first two customers to enter the establishment. The main hostess (H1) yelled at another hostess (H2) who was in the 'to go' area to take us to our seats. The H2 said no, so the asked a server to seat us and H2 argued with H1 before finally taking us to our seats with the fakest smile ever. We sat for over 5 min watching a gaggle of servers (about 12 of them) shooting the breeze over in the bar area; mind you we are still the only ones there. A server finally comes up to take our order, I order a water with lemon and my nephew ordered a BJs root beer. The server brought the water, no lemon and told us the didn't have root beer, so he ordered something else. She brought his orange cream soda and them another 5 min later she brought a small plate with two lemons. Another server came and said that they were going to be taking care of us, but still don't know who our server was supposed to be. Our food came with no issue and was delicious so no complaints there. Before we finished our meal I asked our new server to speak to a manager, and he was at out table within 3 minutes. He asked what he could help me with, and have him a quick rundown of our experience and apologized because 1-they DO HAVE root beer, so he brought one and 2- the hostess' actions and behavior were unacceptable. I stressed that both servers were extremely polite and I understood that we weren't their table to work. He offered my nephew a pizookie for free and took off the cost of his meal. I appreciate the attentiveness of the manger and his willingness to make things right. I sincerely hope they take this experience as an opportunity to train the hostess and servers on how to make the guests feel welcome instead of a burden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=220,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.38,2.16

With the start up staff on hand they were all over you. Did not expect that to last but did not expect a service nose dive either.  Last 2 experiences were meh and this past Saturday evening was downright bad. Katy is getting many new places. They need to fix this. Word is apparently out about service as we did not have to wait at a prime dinner time. The staff is very confused. We had the same issue that many have mentioned. Sat too long with no contact. Then a person comes up who is not your server. Appears after that that nobody can decide who keeps the table. Food dropped at a reasonable time but no silver, slow with beer (I only ordered 2) , took ketchup forever to get to the table. Waited too long for check.  Overall sad and a glaring difference from what I experience at other BJ's locations. They were running out of beers and all servers appeared frazzled and running. Servers appear burned out?

210,Conota B.,"Houston, TX",85,18,8.0,2.0,2014-10-02,"It was a pleasant afternoon and my wife and I  decided on BJ's over Mesquite Grill, just because I generally like the their causal atmosphere. There was a group of young boys in front of us, and one of them decided to take a selfie with his friends and the hostess up front. I believe they retook the pic because the other hostess wasn't in the first one. After that was finished we were greeting. Not the kind of welcoming atmosphere i am used to. I little acknowledgement before the 1st pic or even after would have gone a long way. We were sat quickly and our waitress did a quick table visit, while she was attending to a big top. She was extremely friendly and efficient while waiting us, checking back several times. She apologized for taking longer than she wanted because of her other table, which wasn't necessary, but appreciated. She was by far the best part of our experience. We ordered the Santa Fe rolls. They came out quickly and as usual, they were delicious. For dinner we shared the Brewhouse burger, medium, because for me med-well is too dry. Our burger arrived, I cut it in half and discovered sprinkles of pink in a mostly dark burger. The fries were as over done as my burger, but my waitress returned shortly and quickly went to re-fire another burger for us.  Everything was fine, that happens.  The manager came by our table, which I expected to go better than it did. He began saying they are preparing our burger, then went on to say, ""We looked at it in the back and it was pink to us"". Okay...first, who is we? Second, are you implying that my crispy brown burger was medium. Lastly, are you saying I have it all wrong? After the confusion had passed, I replied that i just wanted my burger medium, which is a thick pink center. He suggested that he can have it prepared under what I want to make sure. To me that meant med-rare. I agreed because med-rare  is better than med-well.  Later, the same ""its not me its you"" manger came to the table with the new burger. I cut it in half and...it was med-well. I expected medium and even med-rare, but not med-well. For the love God! There was a thin line of pink and it wasn't as dry as the 1st burger. I can say the fries were definitely better thou, better the burger as well. It was certainly not medium. But, if the manager doesn't now medium, then what should I actually expected. I said it was fine, it was better. I was visible not satisfied, but  he was happy with that and was gone.  Afterwards, I scanned Yelp and to my pleasant surprise (sarcasm), they had 2 1/2 stars. ""Now it makes since"", I thought to myself. The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, the beer selection is grand, the service was magnificent, the food mediocre and the manager, slightly pompous.  Will I go back? Its doubtful.

99,Emily M.,"Katy, TX",0,5,,2.0,2014-10-11,"This was the third strike for this location. Always had bad service before, but this time we went at off-peak hours so our hopes were high.  We used to frequent a location near Dallas and loved the food, so we were VERY excited to have one open up near our new home in Katy.  We arrived at 4 pm on a Saturday.  It was clearly a shift change. I get it, servers are finishing up the lunch shift,  and new ones are arriving for the night shift. But every restaurant has a shift change, and most are able to perform this seamlessly so the guest isn't aware!  We were never acknowledged by a host. Wait, that's a lie....One was sweeping (sidework, clearly) and TWICE asked me to move so she could sweep the spot I was standing on.  Restaurant 101: don't make the guest feel like they are keeping you from being somewhere else. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, but whatever.  Since we weren't greeted by anyone for the good 2 minutes we stood at the host stand, we decided to sit at the cocktail tables.  We were passed by 12 employees, none of whom acknowledged our existence, before my husband went to the bar for drinks. Jamie helped us out, was super nice, and apologetic for the terrible service. Then two seats opened at the bar with Jamie, so we grabbed them! We figured we'd much rather tip this guy than some server who obviously would rather lean on computers for $2.13/hr. Well, Jamie was leaving for the day too, bummer! He was the only person there that seemed to care about his job. The other bartenders were.....meh. One never looked up from the service well. The other just sucked. We ordered one app, finished it, then ordered a second app. Almost 30 minutes later, we had finished our beers and paid out (movie was starting soon) and were still waiting on our 2nd app. Had to ask the guy to box it up. No one apologized, no one even acknowledged the problem.  A simple ""I'm sorry, we'll get those out to you asap"" goes a long way. Hell, a simple ""hello"" when you stand at the host stand also goes a long way. Unfortunately,  the service has been poor each of the 3 times we've been here. Today was just the worst,  and there really was no excuse. It wasn't packed, there were tons of staffers hanging around the POS. It was clear the staff simply did not care, and management was oblivious.  We like the food and the beer, but actually getting service is just too hard. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=100,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.6720000000000002,2.68

40,Adam S.,"Katy, TX",175,447,603.0,3.0,2014-12-06,"BJs is another sports bar that is trying to redefine itself as a restaurant, but coming up a bit short.  Great appetizers, desserts and beer.  Main courses are ok. Other Yelpers are right on about this being a chain restaurant.  Not all chains are the same, though.  Houston-based chains such as Landry's/Pappas/Ninfa's are very popular and delicious.  National chains such as BJs don't quite hit the same quality mark.  Houston definitely knows good food. Anyway, I came to BJs for my birthday dinner with the family.  It was Black Friday and the place was very busy.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which was nice. We had a booth near the bar area and started with the fried artichokes and spinach/artichoke dip.  The fried artichokes were very tasty...would definitely order them again.  The spinach/artichoke dip was ok...have had better. I ordered a Tatonka stout beer.  This was a tasty stout...slightly sweet, and full-bodied.   I would definitely order one again.  The porter also looks good.  BJs has a good list of beers...they brew almost every type of beer you can think of. BJs has a fairly large menu...many types of burgers, pizza, and pasta.  I ordered a sirloin steak medium-rare, but it came out medium-well.  They fixed the order, but when I received a better steak, my wife and daughter were almost done with their meals.  The seasoning on the steak was good, but the meat quality could have been better for the price.  The steak was probably a 6-ounce cut.  I also had a wedge salad with the steak that was tasty, but the wedge was very small, probably a third of the size of a normal wedge. My wife and daughter liked their entrees of Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and Grilled Chicken Alfredo, but again nothing special about the taste.  The Alfredo portion size was large, and we had leftovers to take home. We tried the Pizookie Trio for dessert, which is basically a cookie with a large scoop of ice cream on top.  Three cookies are served with the trio (duh!).  The Pizookie is a must-have.  My daughter and I liked the macadamia nut cookie and my wife enjoyed the peanut butter cookie.  BJs packaged-up our desserts to take back home. Service was ok.  We had to wait a bit at times, but overall was not bad.  With tip, we spent about $30 a person overall.  A bit high for what we received. I am not itching to rush back to BJs, but when we do visit again, I will definitely have an appetizer, a pizookie, and a beer.  If I have an entree, I will probably try a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=80,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.9320000000000002,2.36

This location is an insult to all the decent bj's locations. Worst staff I've witnessed. Even walking through the front door to meet the poor excuses for hostesses let's you know from the beginning not to expect much. Disorganized and unprofessional seeps from the front podium. 3 times I've had the Unpleasure of  visiting, only once by my own choice. To witness servers and hostesses leaning and hanging out at the hostess stand is an absolute joke, especially when nothing is being accomplish because of the excuse that ""they are very busy"". Te food is fine, I've always liked their menu, but the servers don't know it or the drinks they pride themselves on. The food tasted fine, but the presentation of meals has gone to slop. There is a noticeable lack of control through the kitchen to the front of house and it's sad. I even called the manager at one point to discuss the problems we saw and had, not to demand or be angry, but to assist and point out what we as customers were seeing. Every  statement was given an answer to appease and was noticeably blown off. It was even more evident at our next visit. I even saw some of the same staffers that were involved in other pitiful businesses around Katy. Being a career server used to mean being good at your job, now it just stands for not being able to do anything else and going from one business you ruined to the next. I've given two stars because they still have good tasting food, and I love the beer and their pre printed gluten free menu, someone I dine with is a celiac and it helps. Unfortunately, the servers neither know where or what the gluten free menus are, they can't bring the RIGHT beer, and the food looks terrible. Pitiful excuse for what used to be a great chain.

But, then it took us an hour before we saw our food. Our waitress disappeared on us. LITERALLY!! So, we had to go back and forth to the bar to get refills like our first visit. Then when we got our food we were told our 2 year olds plate wasn't ready yet. I fed him off of my plate bc by now we have been in the restaurant for an hour and a half before getting food so he was not happy.

Stuffed mushrooms and Mac and Cheese for appetizer. Tried to pair with Stone Ruination IPA, which they did not have. Second choice was Piraat Belgium Ale which was excellent. Server was attentive but a bit absent minded. Cons: They forgot to add the mushrooms to my burger. They brought me some microwaved mushroom in a small cup when I told my waiter that my burger was missing the mushrooms I requested. The Mac and cheese lacked cheese and was very dry as if it had sat out for a while before serving. They were completely out of the Stone IPA though it was still on their menu.

Oh and don't order the scrimp scampi pasta. Horribly great and bland. I was very disappointed. I didn't make my server take it back because I already did that with my lemonade.

He let me enjoy my time while dining alone on a business trip on a Friday evening. I never felt rushed or felt he was annoyed with me.  He was honest and I could tell he had a passion for being in the service industry. However beyond him and the Brussels sprouts this place is terrible.   I ordered a Caesar salad with steak and it took 2.5 hours to get the steak (a sirloin med-rare) correct.  First time it was a still mooing ribeye. Then it was the same ribeye slightly cooked. The. 2 more attempts until it was correct.  When I politely spoke with the manager about the issue his exact words were ""well we aren't a steak house so what do you expect"".  Whaaaaaaaaat?!?! Regardless of whatever your establishment is based upon, you offer a menu with variety.  That being said, it isn't rocket science to cook a steak. Unless no one in your kitchen knows what a cow is, let alone a steak! That is a poor excuse for a poorly run kitchen. I've worked in the service industry for numerous years now and to have this type of excuse handed to me was and is beyond unacceptable. I corrected this manager and the look on his face was pretty priceless. Never in my years of eating out have I had that excuse coupled with a steak salad taking 2.5 hours.  However now we will discuss Jerry.  He obviously cares enough about his guests and his job that after all the dust settled he sat down with me and asked me how he could improve what happened this evening.  I throughly enjoyed the conversation with this young man and I can only hope this establishment learns from their mistakes and can correct them accordingly.

125,Brent H.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-01-20,"Right off I am a regular patron of this BJ's location & when I visit, 50% of the time it's a to-go order.   I will sit at the bar & place my to-go order there for I know the main bartenders & they know me.  They know how to properly take care of their customers, which I can see in their repeat business for I see many customers coming up to the bar calling them by name.  The experience I am writing about just happened to be a day in which neither one of them were there. I came in on Mon.  Jan. 18 at 5:30pm to order a to-go pizza.  As normal I went to the bar to place my order, which they only had one other customer sitting at it & I sat one seat over from him.  There were three employees behind the bar & they were at the speed well end of the bar toward the back of the restaurant talking to each other (the other guy at the bar & me were at the middle part of the bar).  I figured that in a minute or two they would look up & come over to see what I needed.  After 10 minutes (and yes I timed it), they still had not even acknowledged my presence nor less asked if there was anything I wanted. What made it even worse is that I found out one of the three employees behind the bar was actually one of the location's managers.  During those 10 minutes that manager & one of the bar keepers even walked by me twice without saying anything to me. I actually got up & walked out of the restaurant, while nobody at the bar or at the front door said anything to me, & called home telling my family about my experience while also asking them what they wanted me to do since no one there was interested in me or my business.  They really wanted the pizza so I told them I would go in again for only 5 minutes & if I wasn't waited on then I would leave & we would make other dinner plans.  As I was going in the only other bar patron was coming out shaking his head saying to me he would have walked out sooner if they would have ignored him like they did me.  When I went back in I was the only person sitting, in the same seat I was originally in, at the bar. After about 4 minutes someone who had not been behind the bar came in & actually asked me if there was anything I needed (this was about 20 minutes after I first sat down).  I figured I would see how this whole visit would play itself out, so I didn't say anything other than just place my to-go order. When the pizza came out it was about 6:20pm.  I checked it & found that the kitchen had used a practice involving the hamburger on the pizza that I thought had ended the last time I complained about it.  The hamburger, the tiny bit that was present, was cooked in well done state for meat.  That is because former employees of this BJ's location told me at times the kitchen would take a previously cooked hamburger, cut it up, & put it on the pizza before it went into the oven.  The results ended up being twice cooked hamburger, again what little hamburger there was on it.

Prime Rib was extremely bland, steaks weren't cooked to correct temperature. It was either well done or extremely rare. We all asked for medium rare.. ugh. Salads were huge as a ""starter salad"" but that was arguably the best part of my meal. It was quite tasty since I like spinach anyways. I ordered the loaded baked potatoes which seemed like they've just microwaved it with 3 pieces of bacon. Barely any bacon, couldn't even see the cheese, and there weren't enough butter.

We had to wait for a bit even though there were many tables available.  The menu had food all over it (very off-putting). My salad came out on a dirty plate- I didn't eat it. Anyhow, when our main food arrived, my daughter's order was wrong, part of my son's order was missing, my husband's order was wrong (and still wrong when it came back out the second time), and they completely forgot mine. They didn't even notice that I was sitting there without food. I figured it was on its way out, but nope... I had to ask a waiter nearby and he said he'd check on it, but I watched him and he never did. When the waitress eventually came back, she said she'd check on it. When she did, she told me she couldn't find it. Eventually it came out when my family was half done eating. My mashed potatoes were completely cold upon arrival and my meat was disappointing. I did not eat it. Everyone else's food was mediocre. Our plates stayed in front of us for a long time. Everything the whole evening was SLOW. My daughter's dessert took almost 30 minutes to arrive. It took almost an hour and 45 minutes from walking in to leaving. Never once did a manager come over after NUMEROUS issues. That would have made a big difference! Where was the manager?

(I took half of my lemon thyme chicken home, as you get two chicken breasts and plenty of rice and veggies.) Both entrees were seasoned and cooked well, served hot and prompt. Service was great; in fact every time we've been here the service has been very good. Our drinks were always refreshed without having to wait or ask, and our server stopped by on occasion to ask if we needed anything.  There are so many restaurants in Katy, and this BJ's seems to have stepped it up recently to keep diners coming in.  We love the dining room as well; the big screen TVs and option to sit at the bar.

Saw a guy with a pizza walking all over the place, even walked right past us then returned back to us with the pizza he was walking all over the place. Again is was barely warm and when he walked away he said he was going to get the celery. He never brought it to us. Ordered a Porter beer and a pizokie (sp)? The beer came out but not dessert until I was almost 2/3s finished with the beer and yes I was sipping the beer not chugging it. Asked for a box to go for the 3 pieces of pizza left and asked for some ranch dressing to go for it. No problem we were told, got the box and no ranch. The company needs to figure out what's going on at this place or is it at all of them?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy?start=60,2.92,2.88,2.88,,2.896
13,Connie S.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,2.0,2017-09-23,It took 45 minutes to get our food. My fish tacos were room temperature.  Waiter did not check back with the two of us. We needed drink refills and had to waive him down. There are too many other restaurants with better service and food in this area.

More added on and it ended up being 23 people on a busy sat night during a world series game. They were able to accommodate us even with our extra people. Staff was very competent and friendly. Awesome experience for my first time at BJs. Highly recommend! PS. Our server Jeffrey was awesome!!

34,Lisa M.,"Houston, TX",0,60,,2.0,2017-11-05,"We were there late Sunday afternoon. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated although the place was 1/2 full. It took a while for my beer to arrive. I asked why. The young man said it was because they give priority to bar patrons. What? Get me my beer.  The wings arrived on the cold side. They were unappetizing and I smelled that strange, fake butter taste on them. The chicken dumplings arrived cold as well. Otherwise they were good. My chicken pita Mediterranean tacos were warm and tasty. They came with a super odd, rice and I don't know what side. It was not edible. The complimentary soup, because of the wait, well, that was cold too. The fish tacos were ok. I finished my beer and was never offered another one. We didn't bother with dessert and won't go back. Fast food, poor management, and cold food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy,2.8,2.9,2.9,,2.86

I got the ribeye and I got the steak because I was out for a company lunch....not because I thought ordering a steak at a non-steak place was a good idea, but I decided to give it a chance. The ribeye, which was ordered med rare, came out overcooked and tasted burnt. Broccoli was under seasoned.

35,Max U.,"Katy, TX",8,31,1.0,5.0,2017-11-13,"I really like this place. I have been coming to this restaurant at least once a month since it opened (sometimes two to three times in a month). I do not understand why there are so many average reviews on Yelp. The servers are notably nice and the food is good. I recommend their pizzas, their burgers and oddly enough their jambalaya. All good. Beer selection is what I would expect from a Brewpub. I can watch a game here or I can have a nice dinner with my kids. Also, you need to have the Pizookie at least one time...by and Large the servers are outstanding; friendly and attentive. I also just recently found out that BJ's does a tremendous amount of support to a few charities and gives back to the community. That's a restaurant that we should all consider supporting...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy,2.84,2.89,2.89,,2.87

Phil (Vietnamese brotha) was taking care of me tonight and he was great. I made the reverse happy hour (9-11pm).. half off individual deep dish pizzas and 5 dollar house cab. Not a bad deal at all. The food came out timely. The drink and service was more than decent. I got a BJ house deep dish (twice). Pepperoni and italian sausage were seasoned on point. The house cab was okay, but the bartender was very heavy handed and a nice guy. I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-katy,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

The timing of the meals brought out of the kitchen is terrible. Four people in our group today. Two meals came out 15 minutes before the other two meals. Two of us were almost done eating before two of us even started to eat.
