On Feb 26, we took some out of town guests there and the service was awful. It took at least 30 minutes to get our food and barely saw our waitress during the visit.

156,Joanna R.,"Washington, DC",91,171,,4.0,2012-03-06,"For a chain restaurant, this place was pretty good. I went to BJ's on my final night in Florida with my mother, sister and two aunts. We were seated right away in a spacious booth in the back.   The selection of beers on tap was a very welcome surprise with selections ranging from their own brews to Yuengling. And bottled beers?! This was even more of a surprise both for their selection of imported beers and affordability.  The food menu is extensive- pizza, burgers, salads, pasta. Most entrees are priced around $10. We ordered salads and burgers, everyone was satisfied and enjoyed their choices. Even though the portions looked massive each of us completely finished our meals.  Our server was great, even took pictures for us at the end of the dinner. Overall, nice way to end my trip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3120000000000003,3.5600000000000005
157,Michelle C.,"Kissimmee, FL",5,13,4.0,4.0,2012-06-06,"For me, BJ's is about the pizzas and the beer. Although, their other menu items are also worth trying but these 2 items are definitely their highlights.  I love coming here for happy hour mostly to eat. I believe it's 4-7 on weekdays and then maybe 9 til closing. During Happy Hour their appetizers are all 50% off and so are their mini deep dish pizzas. Totally bang for the buck at this point. Their drinks aren't discounted as much as their food during this time but it's still cheaper than the regular prices.  I like their Bacon Cheeseburger Mini Deep Dish Pizza. It tastes exactly like a BACON CHEESEBURGER. The toppings include: sausage, bacon, red onions, pickles, and cheese. I believe the marinara sauce on the pizza acts as ketchup.  During Happy Hour it's only $5.00. If you don't want so much carb, you can also go for their flatbreads. Also, discounted during HH. I like their Chicken Club and Chicken Pesto. The Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good. A tiny bit spicy but really yummy and low cal. The Ahi Poke. When I first had this, the quality of the Tuna was good. It tasted fresh and the portion size was good for appetizer. It's also around $5.00 during Happy Hour. Comes with fried wonton chips on the side to scoop up the tuna. I don't know what happened, but recently, their fish quality went down. It's completely noticeable and I refuse to order it anymore. The Beers: I'm not an expert in beer but I was determined to try every specialty beer they carried at BJ's. So I just went down the list every time I went back to Bj's. I really like the Blonde Beer. It's not as bitter as the lagers, good flavor still, and refreshing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=120,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3120000000000003,3.5200000000000005

Their beers are pretty good, but it's not like they're being brewed in the back and they're not $2-$3/pint better than nationally produced beers. The menu reads like an encyclopedia and maybe there is where BJ's goes slightly wrong.  They go way beyond just bar fare with burgers and flatbreads and pastas and calzones and salads and pizzas and ... well, it just doesn't end.  And while I've never complained about the quality of the food, I've also never ordered the same thing twice, as nothing's blown me away.

This is definitely a place to go when you have many tastes amongst your group or an undeceive group, as they have plenty of choices. Their bar is nice and the dessert choices are good- if you have room after your meal. This location is at The Loop, which I've mentioned in other reviews as a place full of kids.

201,Mimi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",135,272,1941.0,3.0,2013-08-19,"This place is nice. Great food. The waitress was great. But when the food was served the food runners or servers came to deliver. We had a party of 12. And the foods got mixed-up. I had ordered the corn fritters (delicious). The appetizer sampler was good too. The main course for my husband and I were the ribs and chicken meal. All was dandy until I cut into the chicken. The chicken was not fully cooked. Smoked chicken is not fleshy pink when you cut towards the center of the chicken. The waitress looked and said ""she'll get her manager."" This probably happens a lot there. The manager came back with it looks like that because its smoked but I'll have them cook it for another 7 minutes. To me if the chicken is fully cooked why would you have to cook it for another 7 minutes. I end-up not eating that but just ate my sides and took the chicken home and didn't eat it. We spent $255 on 6 adults and 6 kids. Gave a $60 tip. Was not looking for hand-outs or freebies. Just felt like it was a typical line that was used to go back to cook the chicken longer so they were not at fault for serving raw chicken. The desserts were great. Tiny cookies serviced with ice cream. Chocolate, red velvet and rasphberry and white chocolate cake like cookies in individual cookie tins. That was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.2440000000000007,3.5200000000000005

Now, about those negatives; regardless if we go when it's busy or not, there is usually a pretty good wait for the food.

177,Marcy E.,"Portland, OR",5,16,,2.0,2013-11-24,"I've been to this BJ's twice and both times were terrible experiences.  The first time I went with a friend to try something new. We got in and were seated immediately, which actually didn't matter because a waiter didn't show up for 20 minutes, and the other waiters who passed by us didn't bother asking if we needed help. We ended up getting up from our seats and were about to walk out the door until the hostess suggest she bring out the manager and he would help us. He treated us to a free appetizer, the ahi poke, which was pretty good. The rest of the food still took a very long time to come out and wasn't anything amazing.  The second (and final) time was last Friday with my husband. He's a fan of breweries and we both wanted somewhere good to eat. I figured I'd give this place another shot but soon realized that was a big mistake.  We're first greeted by a very pushy host about the reward card. I had actually filled one out last time but - surprise! - wasn't in the system. And I definitely wasn't filling out another card before my meal.  Once again, it was packed and once again the food and service was really slow. I wonder if they're always packed because it takes them so long to bring out food (maybe half those people are from the lunch rush??). And this time the food was terrible. All of our food was lukewarm; we got the two appetizer bites dishes, a pasta dish, and shrimp tacos (everything that should have been coming out hot). The waiter was also slow getting to our table, which I'm not sure why since we only saw him go to our table and the two on either side of us - what else could he be doing?  All in all, this place gives the chain restaurant a bad name.

They didn't come with the chips like it said on the menu and the only reason I noticed was because another guest down a few spots ordered the same thing and actually got the chips. Oh well, I didn't need them anyway the tacos were filling enough by themselves.  I ordered a margarita that said it was made with fresh juices so I decided to try it being the super picky margarita drinker that I am that hates sour mix.

The crust on the chicken is nice and crunchy, and goes very will with the sun dried tomatoes. Personally, I don't think the basil garnish on the chicken does anything for this plate besides just add some color contrast. The side of White cheddar mashed potatoes is very well balanced and has a tart but subtle cheese taste.  For desert, this time we tried the Smores Pizookie. Overall, I would give it an 7/10 if you have a pallet for traditional. Expecting a Smores desert, I would have liked a graham cracker to show up somewhere, but alas it was absent. The substitute, peanut butter , while creative made it very rich and almost impossible to finish after a meal.

For such a big place, it's not that loud, even though it appeared to be roughly 70% full.  I had no problem hearing and keeping up a conversation with my dinner mates. Our server, Kendal, was a rather handsome fella with a super outgoing personality who immediately took our drink order and gave  us time to contemplate appetizers.  We ordered three - fried artichoke hearts, Cantina fries (smothered with sauces that made the whole appetizer taste like a big taco chili  - DELISH!) and calamari. ALL were delicious, served hot and well flavored. After noshing on appetizers, we ordered lunch - ME : BBQ pulled pork slider with a BBQ chicken breast and fries. MY THREE DINNER PALS: bacon cheeseburger, quesadillas and a personal pepperoni pizza with a Caesar salad - good American comfort food that certainly provided us with the much needed energy to take on the Christmas shopping adventures ahead of us.  Would I come back to BJ's?

We weren't offered anything as gratitude, and we were charged twice for one of the dishes we had once. We were expected to pay for the full dinner that was an absolute abortion.

62,William A.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",90,20,1.0,1.0,2016-02-20,"Had my worst restaurant experience ever! Yesterday I was in the mood to eat dinner and picked a place here in Kissimmee. I was promptly sat down and given a menu. 5 minutes later another customer sits down at an adjacent table. In the time I was sitting at the table the adjacent table had not one or two employees stop at the table but three! It wasn't until the third person realized that we were sitting there and not being attended that she said did someone assist us yet. Ok, progress! So the person comes over and takes our drink order of: an iced tea and a blueberry Sea Dog. 5 min later they returned with the tea and told me Sea Dog is a seasonal beer. (It's not a seasonal beer. They have a brewery in the Disney Springs vicinity.) So I ordered a Sam Adams. The guy disappears and now it's 10 minutes later... This just turned into a wtf moment! The adjacent table had their drinks well before I even placed mine. Hmm... The other adjacent table that was there prior to me arriving was just departing from their meal and it was a party of 8. I looked over at that table. It wasn't being bussed but instead there were two employees standing there conversing. One has using the back of the chair to place their weight on to use it as a crutch to support their front weight.  Now here's the questions. 1) Server - where was this person? Why wasn't I greeted promptly? What happened to my drink? Why weren't a small party of two people served the drink at the same time? How long does it take to pour a draft beer?  2) Staff -  Why were you standing around in public? Can't you do that out of people view? How is it that the manager/assistant manager/hostess did not see all the lack of professionalism that was taking place at your establishment? If you know the place is packed or not why isn't there someone there to pickup on overflow? I didn't know that acquaintances get preferential treatment, such as being greeted by various members of staff yet bypass other customers which makes it appear like the other customers don't exist? 9pm isn't a busy hour on a Friday evening. Yet it felt like no one had the intention of serving me. It felt like whoever was in charge of my table had called it quits and made enough money for the night. Being a server is part of hospitality and extremely important to the success of the business. Anything less will not keep your franchise afloat.  To make matters worse I eat healthy and I saw some great items on the menu that I would have tried. Now I will never try them because of this fiasco. Eating on a consistent timing is of importance to me. So after 30 minutes of getting nowhere I plainly got up and walked out. I wasn't going to make a fuss. Instead I headed over to Bonefish Grill.  Bonefish proceeded to sit me down and have the server at my table 2 minutes after being seated. Not only was I greeted promptly I was also recommend drinks, appetizers, and a main course. The difference between establishments were the difference between a preschool diploma and a doctorate diploma.  @bjsrestaurants you need to retrain your staff. It was not only embarrassing but laughable. I would pick any other restaurant/brewery over your lackluster Kissimmee location.

We were there just afternoon time on a Sunday. The food itself was cooked well and tasty. I had the portabello swiss burger, one friend had shrimp tacos and the other grilled chicken.

It took 45 minutes to get our food and 20 to get our 2nd drinks. The service was clearly slow. Our waitress Victoria only came back once to check on us to see if we needed anything and once to see if we were ready for the check or if we were having dessert, in that order. Yep the check and then asked about dessert. Our waitress was pleasant enough just not attentive enough. Maybe she had too many tables but I felt she should have checked on us more often.

14,Laura H.,"London, Canada",17,76,14.0,3.0,2017-03-13,"I dined here several times while staying at a vacation rental close to the Loop. This franchise was new to me and overall I had better lunchtime experiences, but overall I would say this was better than average fare for a restaurant that serves ""everything"". The restaurant space itself is massive and offers both booth and table options. There is a large bar area as well. Lunch: I loved their endless soup and salad combo ($9.5). I started with broccoli cheddar soup and the wedge salad. Salad was a touch skimpy on the blue cheese, but still very fresh lettuce and a decent amount of cherry tomatoes. The broccoli cheddar soup was comparable to ones I've had at Panera Bread. When I found myself still hungry, I ""refilled"" my soup with their chili. It was hearty, a bit of a kick that was tempered by the sour cream garnish. On another occasion I tried their tomato cheese salad. It was my least favourite of the options I tried, but still fine. Their grilled cheeses were great ($7.25). Huge portions. Root beer ribs were a bit sweet, but tender. Lunch prices are very reasonable.  Dinner: Less successful. No endless soup and salad available. I had one of their ""enlightened"" entrees: the Peruvian chicken quinoa bowl. ($13.5) It was my favourite entree here. The chicken was very moist and the tomato/onion/mushroom/spinach compote it sat on was nicely spiced. I tried their Portobello mushroom salad ($5.75) that didn't come with the asparagus as described. I alerted the staff who brought me a bowl of asparagus. I had mostly finished the salad at that point so not a great solution. And the worst entree I tried was the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs ($15.75). Yes, there was a lot of food. The garlic roll was the best part. The pasta was mushy, the sauce was bland and the meatballs tasted like sawdust. It said ""sausage blend"" but I would have guessed chicken meatballs from the texture. Beer: Solid. I liked the Brewhouse Blonde. There are lots of choices. It is a brewhouse so you're expecting good craft beer. I was not disappointed. Service: Hit and miss. Some servers were great. Others ok. One literally left our table and disappeared. Never came back. Someone else had to bring us our meals and bill. Odd.

Not too bad and the text thing was super handy. The menu here is super big, that's why I chose it - simply because with 6 adults and at least 3 of them being picky eaters, I knew there would be something for everyone and almost all of us were sick of burgers and fries by this point. One of my buddies wanted to try some of their beer but didn't know what kind, so they brought him three to sample before he chose! Cool! I ended up ordering the bacon brisket, which turns out is a burger (duh) with a caesar and a fancy drink. The drink was good but nothing to write home about and not a ton of booze in it either. We all got some artichoke and spinach drip, which was really good, and my friends got the fried artichokes, which were awesome!! Yum! The burger was good, not what I was expecting but nice and tasty just the same. The salad was good if a bit soggy, could have used less dressing in my opinion. I guess this is a Canadian thing, but a bunch of people ordered chicken tenders and when they asked the waitress for plum sauce, she had no idea what that was and didn't know what sweet and sour sauce was either!!

On Friday and Saturday after 4pm and Sunday all day BJs is doing Prime Rib meal for $28 that comes with a soup or salad, Prime Rib, two sides, and a pizzoki. After spending some time looking at my options I choose the Broccoli and Cheddar soup which was honestly my favorite I have ever had. It was a smooth, but hearty cheese soup with nice sized pieces (I find most places have time specks) of broccoli, and packed with flavor. I ordered my Prime Rib medium rare, and while it came out slightly more rare than medium rare, it was like a party in my mouth! The meat belted like butter and the seasoning that they use on the outside gave a nice kick. My sides were steamed broccoli (a bit on the raw side, but I like it that way) and a baked potato and both were just you normal sides. For my pizzoki I got the regular Chocolate Chunk rather than a fancy flavor and it was the perfect end of the meal. Also, I ended up saving him a bit of each course and I had plenty to take home and warm up for another meal which made it well worth the almost $35 it ended up being with tip.

Overall awesome experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,3.68,3.52,3.52,,3.5840000000000005

4,Travis J.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",540,146,423.0,5.0,2017-09-07,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants thanks to the variety of food they provide and the fact that they brew their own beer. I've been to a few around the area and never reviewed one. But I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience at any BJ's. The service is always good as is their food.  I had orederd their hangover burger which came with an over medium egg and bacon and was served open faced along with a side of fries. The burger was cooked to my liking and I couldn't finish. Thankfully I didn't because I later received a surprise dessert that I've never seen on the menu and apparently a secret item. Well the secrets out I guess! It was a beignet topped with ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries! This is a must have!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,3.92,3.54,3.54,,3.692
15,Thom M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,20,,4.0,2017-09-07,"Been going to BJs for a while and everything is so consistent. Only once had to send back an item and they were great about it. Best Happy Hour prices on food and drinks. Great Parmesan encrusted chicken and Jambalaya on the entrees. So many good appetizers like avocado egg rolls, ahi poke tuna and blonde asparagus. They also have great burgers.   If you're going to go frequently I advise you to join their rewards as it adds up quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,4.0,3.55,3.55,,3.73
3,Erin G.,"Orlando, FL",89,91,440.0,5.0,2017-10-24,if we are down by the Loop near happy hour for BJ's (usually 10 pm or later plus games) we stop for their deal.  I belly up to the bar and Tina Y is frequently the bartender.  She provides great service and is delightful.  She remembers you and is attentive and you get your drinks and food quickly.  Half price mini pizzas and shareable appetizers. Good deals for happy hour Great service from Tina Happy Customers plus they have high def TVs in the bar,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,4.04,3.55,3.55,,3.746
30,Lee L.,"Naples, FL",157,12,3.0,2.0,2017-11-10,"Ate at this location tonight and it was a horrible experience. Our female server who I will not name on here needs to find a new line of work because she doesn't know how to do her job. Not only was she lacking personality, after she took our order never once did she check on us to see if everything was alright. I was sucking down ice cubes because I was out of Pepsi. When I finally hunted her down I had to ask her for drink refills. When it came time we wanted our bill I had to ask another server to find our waitress and tell her we want our bill so we could leave. Five minutes later she showed up. On a good note our pizza was the best pizza we have had in a long time! I would get it again but next time I will get it to go. We will not be back to dine there again. For the price they charge there and to get the worst service it's not worth our time and money. I would recommend Bahama Breeze and Cheddars down the road! They have great service and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=20,3.92,3.52,3.52,,3.68
16,Barbara Librie H.,"Celebration, FL",17,13,,5.0,2017-11-10,"BJ's is a lunch favorite for us. We always enjoy a Ahi Poke appetizer and they accommodate my request for no onions so we know it is always fresh. Today we shared the Prime Rib dip sandwich with fries and it was more than enough for us. Mom had the classic grilled cheese sandwich which she really enjoyed. Our server was very attentive and checked back often to make sure we were okay. And, best of all and in spite of the noisy atmosphere, our grandson slept through the entire meal! We had lunch again today for Veteran's Day. My husband's lunch was complimentary as a thank you for his service. The restaurant was quiet crowded with other Veterans and their families. We both had the BBQ Bison Burger medium rare. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. I ordered mine with no bun, pico or aioli. It came out served on a bed of lettuce with coleslaw and was exactly what I hoped for.  I love being a rewards member and having the ability to view and pay my check on their app as well as getting points to use on a future meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,3.92,3.52,3.52,,3.68
7,Aileen C.,"Orlando, FL",160,150,306.0,4.0,2017-11-16,"Ordered the appetizer sampler which came with boneless wings (which we had tossed in glazed root beer) - I was a really big fan of the flavor... avocado egg rolls - this was delicious!!!, mozzarella sticks - standard, and Spinach artichoke dip - standard. There was a lot of food, enough to share with 3-4 people. I got the BJs mini deep dish pizza. It was good but a little too doughy - but I guess that's expected since it's deep dish. My fiancé got the prime rib dinner weekend special. It came with soup, the clam chowder we really good, the prime rib with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes, and a pazooki dessert that we had to ask to take to go since we were so full. His entrée was for less than $30 for tons of food. Not bad!  I will like to come back again and try different things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,3.96,3.52,3.52,,3.696

0,Joeily F.,"Saint Cloud, FL",22,1,1.0,4.0,2017-12-21,"I have been here plenty of times with the most recent time being last night. Diana is the sweetest server and very helpful if you have any questions. Many many options of drinks and meals. Below are  things  i've tried: Appetizers  1) Chicken spotters- (outside of dumpling shell) very good starter, kind of feels like you're eating an egg roll, with chicken inside it, comes with an accompanying sauce, didn't really like the sauce that much.  2) Chicken Wings- they have different flavors to choose from, they add just enough of each sauce and the chicken is not too hard or too bland.  3) Flatbread- have not had in a while, but I remember it being good. 4) Artichoke and spinach dip with nachos- my favorite appetizer- love the the creamy dip, warm with the nachos it makes for a great start!  Meals  1) Egg, tomato, lettuce, Avocado burger - this is the first burger I had there, if you like all the ingredients mentioned above, this is for you. (Also, do not think that's the actual burger name)  2) Pasta- oven baked ziti- warm, warm, lots of tomatoes sauce  Drinks 1) Blood orange sangria- has cinnamon, orange, pomegranate, pretty firm flavor and strong. 2) Patron Margarita-  taste like an orange soda. Has tequila in it.  3) Blue vodka and lime drink- a nice not-too-strong drink, that makes for a smooth sip, while still tasting the vodka. 4) Alabama sunset-  for some reason I don't like anything about this drink except how it looks  Dessert The cookie pan with ice cream is a sweet sweet delight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee,4.12,3.53,3.53,,3.766
9,Janet G.,"Middleburg, FL",7,8,,5.0,2017-12-23,"Yesterday, my adult son and I stopped in to BJ's.  I'm pretty sure it was at this location. Our server was Matt! He was such a wonderful young man. Courteous, professional, yet personal. I have never been to a BJ's restaurant before yesterday. The food even tops my favorite all time restaurant ( which I won't name). I ordered the Mac-n-cheese.   I thought, 'this is what Mac- n-Cheese must taste like in Heaven.' During our visit, a young man stopped by our table with a tray full of individual size ( in a shot glass) Rootbeer Floats. He gave my son and I one. YIKES!  Man that was GOOD!!!! We also got the small dessert name,Pazooki for free because we downloaded the restaurants app. I got The Macadamia Nut one and he got the Carmel one. We were delirious with delight. Our entire dining experience was DIVINE. Thank you so much...and a big hug and shout-out to Matt( our server).
