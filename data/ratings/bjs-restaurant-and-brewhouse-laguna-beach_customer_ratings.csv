I had the ""BJ's Favorite"" BJ'S favorite pizza must have been a Digornio, because that's exactly what it tasted like....Way too greasy crust and the toppings had to be the same they use at Pizza Hut. Plus 28 bucks for 2 mini pizzas and 4 sticks of garlic bread!?! Call me a pizza snob, but If I want to torture my tastebuds like that again, I'll get a Digornio with garlic bread combo in the freezer section for $8.99",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.244,2.72

106,Stephanie W.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,2.0,2012-07-02,"Never coming back here again!!! After spending an enjoyable day at the beach, my friend and I were starving and decided to grab a quick dinner at BJ's. The restaurant wasn't too packed and we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The waitress we had seemed a bit awkward or a bit uncomfortable/unhappy to serve us but that was excusable since she was new.  My friend ordered their Jalapeno burger with fries and I ordered a Scampi pasta. After 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the kitchen was backed up and that our food should be arriving soon. It seemed a little odd since the restaurant wasn't full but  we were in a happy mood so we didn't really mind. Another 15 minutes passed by and  I politely asked one of workers about our food. The worker seemed really surprised and asked for our waitress.  We finally received the food after a few minutes and my friend's dish came out stale and luke warm.  Really?! We waited over 40 minutes for luke warm food? We informed the waitress about the meal and she said she would replace it for us. She then gave us the check without mentioning anything about replacing my friend's food. Again, really?! We haven't even eaten yet and you're already giving us the check!?  I couldn't really enjoy my pasta since I felt really irritated by the wait and the service. By the time I was half way finished I asked her if we were still getting the food replaced and she said it was backed up and sort of slammed my glass of water on the table. I'm usually a really laid back person but that PISSED me off!  We finally got the food but decided to take most of it to go since we spent way too much time waiting around!  I think she got in trouble or something because she came back and offered us a free pazookie when we were ready to leave. It didn't really matter considering we were already pissed and the restaurant was practically empty.  I'm usually all about the food but when the service is crappy it just kills the whole dining experience. Long story short: We came in really happy and left really angry.

93,Vivian W.,"Irvine, CA",149,11,2.0,1.0,2012-07-02,"Let me just say that this place is exceptional... Exceptionally bad. I almost never have a negative experience at a restaurant but this was just terribad. I came here after going to Laguna Beach with my twin and we were starving. 20 minutes after we ordered, the new waitress who served us apologized and said there was a holdup in the kitchen, and then proceeded to make senseless small talk but it was just awkward. It made us feel uncomfortable. That's excusable, and she's new, but it took more than FORTY minutes for our food to arrive. We would have liked to receive a free appetizer or something, but she made no such offer. Still, we were in a good mood so we would've been okay, if it weren't for what happened next. My fries were cold and stale so when she asked me how my food was I told her nicely. She said she would try to get me another hot plate of fries, and I was like okay cool. Then right after, when we barely even dived into our food after waiting for so long, she put the check down next to us and said ""take your time"" without even mentioning the fries. Really? Are you trying to be bad at this? Ten minutes later we asked her about it and she just went ""I know. There's a hold up in the kitchen."" and sort of set the water down hard. Are you effing kidding me?! Oh helllll no. Our entire experience & mood was ruined by the slower-than-a-snail speed & bad service. Before we were even finished with our food she tried to take our plates from us without even offering a to-go box. At least when my fries finally arrived she offered us a free pizookie for our trouble, that made it a bit better. We tipped her two dollars, to show her we were irritated but not cheap. Still, never coming here again. I expected better from a nice American place, especially next to the beach. Before dinner we were debating between Johnny Rockets down the street and BJ's. Should have chosen JR's... would've gotten home at least 45 minutes earlier too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=100,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.052,2.76

The place was lively and packed, as opposed to a burger joint close by, which was open and empty.  Ok, that was the only positive. The kids' food was barely edible: overly greasy corn dogs, the sticky rice wasn't anything like Chinese sticky rice, the pasta was generic barilla spaguetti, the fries were frozen generic fries. The best thing on the kids menu was the kiddie sundae. That's basically the only thing they ate. Grown ups didn't do much better. The veggie pizza was quite mushy, my rice was tasty but the mahi-mahi was grossly overcooked. It had the texture of cardboard.

No. After about the 3rd time of witnessing this, we finally said something and were told they were here before us and our turn would soon come.

Food-wise I usually order their delicious pizza but decided to branch out so I ordered the boneless teriyaki wings and they were good, not the best. I wouldn't say they were spicy per se, but they definitely had a kick to them. I'm a wuss but let's just say if I didn't have my sprite to drink my eyes would have been watering up and my nose running, but I'll say it again...i'm a wuss. I think if or when I go back I will go back to my normal pizza order because that's what they're known for. My grandma ordered the quesadilla and it was presented well on the plate, not to mention she said it was pretty tasty. My mom ordered the crusted chicken sandwich and it wasn't what she thought, she said it was alright but probably wouldn't order it again. Overall it was a good experience and I would probably go back. I hear it's insanely crowded at night and I believe it, the place is TINY for that amount of traffic!

Although the previous reviews held giant red flag warnings, we went here anyway because BJ's was the only place around showing the game.  First, they tried sitting my party of three at a two person table. Three full grown adults at a two person table? No no no no. No.  Second, the one TV they had there was playing Family Guy. FAMILY GUY during Sunday Night Football. We had to ask three different people to change the channel for us. After a half an hour, they were able to figure out how to change the channel and find the game.  Third, after waiting 30 minutes to order, we finally put our orders in. Randomly, one person got their food ten minutes later, but me and my boyfriend had to wait 45 minutes for our plates. Since we both ordered sandwiches, I really cannot figure out why it took so long!!  Fourth, by the time we got our food, we weren't even hungry anymore due to the lack of service and being filled up on soda. I politely asked our waitress for two sides of ranch. Ten minutes pass and nothing. We could tell she was busy so we flagged down another waiter and asked him for the two sides. He ROLLED HIS EYES. Two minutes later, he slammed the ranch on the table and sarcastically said ""One..."" My boyfriend politely said, ""We need a second one."" The waiter snapped back and said ""I KNOW."" He turned away, grabbed the second little bowl and slid it onto our table saying, sarcastically, ""Two...""  At this point, I LOST it. Before I ripped this guy's head off, I went to the ice cold bathroom. On my way back, I grabbed our waitress and told her we really needed to speak to the manager. I told her it had nothing really to do with her; honestly she was a gem. So, after giving her side of the story to the manager, he came and sat down at our table, listened to our complaints, comped our meal, replaced our entire order and even threw in two pazookies, all to go.  While I believe the manager did EVERYTHING in his power to make us happy, I know for a fact we will never come to this BJ's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=80,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.8920000000000003,2.56

(Which is fantastic food!)  This location does not deliver anymore, they used to-which means I only go at very slow times. There is no parking in Laguna unless you are very lucky. I ordered to go and got two pizzas. The deep dish pizza is just terrible. Scant toppings and all bread that reminded me of challa bread. Even scraping off the top layer was scant reward. I am never eating at this location again. (You also have to walk through the homeless bums at all times of the day.) Must be a poor manager/owner that is trying to save pennies on the cheese. Laguna Beach has two kinds of restaurants, those that really try and those that serve tourists who they don't care if they ever return. BJs Laguna is the second kind.

My husband ordered the jambalaya.  His plate was just fine.  The shrimp, chicken and sausage were well seasoned but the vegetables were not fresh.  For this dish, a stew was prepared and served over white rice (instead of cooking everything as an integral dish).  This is not food I will want to have again (or pay about $17 for it).

It's not even a bad place to take a date after walking around the city, since there are four tables here with ridiculously beautiful views of the beach and ocean. The host was very accommodating to our request for an ocean-view table, the manager hooked us up with a free mini pizookie for signing up for BJ's email spam, and of course, the pizza was good. My girlfriend liked lighter and fluffier crust on this deep-dish, though personally I prefer the thicker, buttery crust you'd find at Hollywood Pies, Rance's, Masa, or Costco. The kale and brussel sprouts salad was tasty, though suspiciously only had one brussel sprout.

It's a really small location which makes it REALLY loud whenever you come here. The service can tend to be pretty slow, which I don't fully understand because it is a small location so there aren't that many tables to cover. The food is pretty decent, but like I said, service is hit and miss. There is one server who is awesome though so I do feel like he deserves a shout out. His name is Ish and he is awesome. He takes care of you and he is one of the servers that is pretty quick and covers everything. Not to mention he is super friendly!

One thing I found odd and especially annoying was that the waiter never gave us any napkins, took forever to return and when we asked he gives us 2 tiny bar napkins. Like really? You don't have normal napkins??   Then the people at the table next to us happened to spill a side of ranch which made a very loud noise everyone could hear. It splattered all over the walls, booth and floor and was a huge mess. Yet every server and person working refused to acknowledge it or Ever clean it up.

20,Jason W.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,40,52.0,4.0,2015-07-12,"***THIS REVIEW REVIEW'S TWO DIFFERENT NIGHTS!! PLEASE READ ALL OF IT*** Ok, so, we have found, that anything less than 3 dollar signs, in Laguna Beach, pretty much closes down at 9pm. For us, being from Vegas, that's a bid deal. It was a Wednesday night, we had just got done watching the sunset on the beach, and were by now (8:30pm), were quite hungry. Our hotel was on the South end of Laguna and we were hoping to find a place within walking distance. We had Ruby's a little further South, but, meh'.  We got on Yelp* and saw that Wine Gallery was still open. Off we go....to the door. We open the door and it's pouring outside! All of a sudden, it looks like Domino's.  We decide to wait for a little bit to see if the rain lets up and in about 20 minutes it does. Off we go. We get to Wine Gallery at about 9:25. Unfortunately, their kitchen had closed at 9:00. Bummer.  Back to Yelp*.  There is a couple of places close to Wine Cellar, but again, 3 dollar signs. All of a sudden my wife says she saw a BJ's when we came into town. So we look up BJ's, they are open til like 11:30. Disco!! Onto the trolley we jump and off to BJ's we go! By the time we got done looking online for a place to eat, waiting for the trolley, and getting there, we got there at about 10:15ish. We were seated immediately, ad were given a choice of seating. We took a seat by the front window. We like to people watch and don't mind people looking at us eating.  Our server was Jeff. Jeff was, well, freaking awesome! What a great guy. Was very friendly and helpful, wasn't afraid to engage us, and was on top of our order top to bottom! BJ's would have gotten a 3 star (right on par for a franchise eatery), but Jeff alone was worth giving them 4! My wife ordered a create-your-own personal sized deep dish and was very happy with it. I had The Italian Market thin crust pizza. Mine was great! I love pepperoncini's and this was a really great pizza.  For drinks she had a glass of wine and I had the HopStorm IPD. Loved the IPA. I am a traditional IPA guy and really like this one.  Now, fast forward to Thursday night (the next night). We really wanted to watch the sunset on the beach again, but now knew that dinner was going to have to be really early, or we were going to be stuck again. Well, fortunately, we now know that BJ's was open late, so we were in business! Thursday, was 7/2, the day before a 3 day weekend beginning for the 4th of July. We knew that the ""strip"" was going to be WAY busier that it was the night before, so we were ready for it. Many of the reviews on BJ's have griped that they are slow and can't handle the business. That didn't thwart our plans though, like I said, we knew it was going to be crazy and we were ready for it. If BJ's has anything going against it, it's that it is small on the inside. I'd guesstimate they have a seating capacity of about 60. Add that, the fact they are right across from Main Beach, that they are a well known and popular franchise, and that they ""less expensive"" from other options in a tourist locale, and they're screwed when it gets busy.  People who have been on the beach all day, are baked from the sun, dehydrated from drinking alcohol all day on the beach (yeah, yeah, I know, it's illegal to drink on the beach. It's illegal to go 55 in a 45 mph zone, but does that stop anybody from doing it? be real people), and are starving, all seem to gravitate towards the restaurants at the same time. And these people, are usually the ones who have zero patience at this point, and love to take it out on the people who are there to provide a service to them. I think that that is where most of the negative reviews come from on BJ's. If people tried to have a little compassion and patience, life might slow down a little for them, and they could take some time to relax and enjoy their surroundings. Such behavior was needed this night.  As the trolley got closer to Main Beach, the sidewalks got PACKED. The restaurants all looked to have 40 minute waits on them.  We got up to BJ's and knew we'd be waiting for at least 40 minutes. We told the greeter that'd we'd like a 2 person table by the window again, preferably one of the 3 that are stand alone, and that we'd be willing to wait for it.  While we were waiting, we overheard, the manager talking with the greeter, (we were being nosy) and they had gotten slammed earlier, which backed them up to the point there were at now, they had had someone walk off the job just a couple of hours ago, and had had someone call out sick for the mid/closing shift. Basically, the bottom had fallen out for them on the busiest shifts on the eve of a major holiday weekend. With that being said, did our service suffer? Was it slower than the night before? Yes. But was our server any less friendly, even tho he was slammed and a little flustered? No. He even recognized us from the night before (it wasn't Jeff, as he had worked an earlier shift) as he was the grett",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=20,2.96,2.68,2.68,3.408,2.7920000000000003

My friend and I kept eating our food and hoped the service would get better, but it continually got worse. After taking away my plate, he comes back to our table to show us a ""magic trick.""

We received our check and were ready to head out when a different waiter comes by and tells us that he gave us the wrong check. ARE YOU KIDDING?

Plus it doesnt have a bar and I usually walk down to a restaurant alone and hate to take up a table when I can just take up a stool. today on my walk I stopped for lunch thinking it was time to see what it looked like inside (it is offseason, not busy). it's tiny, but was pretty empty so I didnt feel bad taking a table to myself. my server Christoper S came over and I ordered a glass of merlot (he didnt know what I was talking about, but I guessed it was because he wasnt really paying attention to me, not because it was an odd order. they only have one merlot on the menu so it shouldnt be hard). he brought it back and I ordered a chicken dish. he brought my dish out and it was fine but his service suggested he couldnt be bothered with me. after I started eating he came by to ask if I was done. I wasnt halfway through yet. he then came back to ask if I was done (again!) and I scarfed down the last bites while he stood and waited! I have no idea why he was so impatient. there were only about two other tables full and they werent his. he made me so uncomfortable but then angry. so when he took my plate I ordered another glass of wine (just to piss him off). he brought it and then asked if I would want a third or if he could bring the check!?? I have no idea what the rush was. there was no one waiting for a table. I sat there nursing my wine thinking maybe he was leaving and wanted to cash out (most servers tell you that if they are leaving), but he stayed working. apparently he just couldnt be bothered with me. I routinely visit and support many places in town and regularly tip 50%. im not sure why he chose to be rude to me and rush me out, but I wont be back and my inclination to stay away all this time was right.  bottom line, dont stand outside waiting for this place. go to watermarc, nicks, The Cliff, Gigi's or somewhere else instead.  p.s-the only nice interaction I had was a manager (?) who came over to ask me about email on my phone and chat a bit. perhaps he sensed how rude his server was...sadly for him I was actually already starting this review because I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome by their server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=40,3.36,2.94,2.94,2.5640000000000005,3.108

Multiple waitresses and waiters (including our waitress) would stop to pet the dog as they walked by and then would continue serving people. I watched our waitress pet the dog and then walk over and grab our salad and bring it over to our table. I was grossed out. When they left the highchair was not wiped down, but placed to the side for someone else to use.  We ordered a pizza and my sisters got hamburgers. They are gluten free and we were very impressed with the gluten free menu and breakdown of what many dishes contain for ingredients. The pizza was good and my sisters loved the hamburgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach,2.64,2.95,2.95,2.7600000000000007,2.8260000000000005

After waiting a bit another guy came up and told us our waiter would be with us soon but we were ready to order..  He told us that the large pizzas were half off today. For that reason, we ordered a large pizza. We waited 30 minutes for our pizza that's when our waiter showed up. The waiter came up and I asked her about the pizookie because I wanted to order one. She gave me a pamphlet and didn't even wait or ask if I wanted it. I was interested but after that and seeing that other customers that waiter was serving were getting just as slow service as us ... we just changed our mind. I will say one thing.. the pizza was good. And the other waiter that was working was working her butt off. After we were done our receipt came back and the pizza wasn't half off. I felt like they were trying to lie to me..very shady... I asked the waiter and she said she had to ask her manager. Came back and it was half off. If I wasn't paying attention I probably would have paid for it. It wasn't even busy.. in there about an hour.. only saw our waiter 2 or 3 times.

It's very small and can get very loud.  No bar.  Location, location location... Sit by the windows!  Second visit was last weekend with my hubby. We walked in, obviously during tourist season and during the weekend.  So there was a wait - ten minutes not bad at all. We were sat right by the to go bar in a tiny table. It was ok.  Not intimate and very loud. Our server was very dingy. He forgot our drinks, our salads sat ready for 10 mins and then he tried to give our dinner away. It's like we were in the movie 50 first dates.  Food was good, but not as great as BJ's usually is. The managers didn't seem helpful at all. Bus guys were awesome, otherwise our plates would have sat there in the half corner we are on. Females handling food, had their hair down and to the side :( it was so gross. Seems like the food handling procedures could use some serious over hauling!  2 stars for overall experience at both venues.  Never go during tourist season or weekends. Their staff can not handle quality food and service. It's both, not just half ass on both.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach,3.08,3.16,3.16,,3.1280000000000006

We called ahead (40 minutes before arriving.) When we finally arrive with five 13 & 14 year olds -- they have no tables and tell us it will be at least an hour. This place could care less about customer service. The rely on location alone for business. STAY AWAY!!! Update: Below is the response from Alice F at BJs ""BJ's doesn't take reservations because the location is so small; the best we have is call-ahead, and even then, we can't hold tables for longer than 30 minutes.  Even that doesn't guarantee you a table, it just guarantees that you jump to the top of the waitlist.  The place isn't built for large parties, so it's pretty much luck of the draw with parties of over 7 members.  It's not our fault that you're stupid.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach,2.92,3.16,3.16,,3.0640000000000005
