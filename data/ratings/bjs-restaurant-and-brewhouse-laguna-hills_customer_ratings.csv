580,Denise C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,10,,2.0,2012-01-07,"Haven't been here since Oct. might have been my last time. My husband and I used to spent most of our Friday night here but decided to cut back due to the$ we were spending. For the most part, we liked the food but it seems to have gotten a little less satisfying, hit and miss.  When we went there in October the service was bad. We had a server that was training the other. During the service I would say I wasn't sure who was gaining who. I got my regular selection. BBQ Chicken salad, there was some kind of problem, because I ordered half a salad. I guess they don't like you doing that when it's not lunch time. Anyway, it wasn't good. Two of the family members I was with had to go to the bar to get another beer as the servers were not coming back to check on us.

261,Phoenix A.,"Seattle, WA",921,737,37.0,2.0,2012-01-09,"Ok!  Starting '12 off with a raving review! I am officially over BJs, not because their food sucks or the service is bad.  It's just that what was a once a special lil' pizza place in the Belmont Shore has now morphed into some off-clone of The Cheesecake Factory or that glutton's paradise, The Claim Jumper. I came here over the holidays and the place was packed.  One very nice thing that they did while we were waiting was pass around an appetizer tray of little pizza bites.  That was way cool. We ordered a calamari appetizer, the bf ordered the angus beef sliders with fries, his bro got the chili, and I was only one who ordered pizza, which was a mini BJ's Favorite.   Prior to food, I ordered the 8 beer flight.  The taster glasses were the largest I had ever been served.  They were so large I had to share.  Unheard of, right?  That's one of the 2 stars right there.  The rest?  A big MEH. Our service was fine if not excellent, but there was a chorus of: 1) I never have to eat here again, 2) Yeah, I'm not really fan, I was just being polite, and 3) who picked this place. So, sorry, BJs.  There are just so many more appealing options out there.  You were once great, but it's time for me to remember you for just that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=280,3.56,3.52,3.52,2.248,3.5360000000000005

419,Michael V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",67,50,2.0,4.0,2012-02-28,"Bernie and I wanted to try something different, as we were completely burned out of Oggi's and their quality has gone downhill.  A majority of the time we utilize delivery because the twins are in bed by 7:30 and after the amount of work for feedings and baths I don't feel like picking anything up. The new BJ's in RSM doesn't delivery yet so we gave the one in LH a call.  The food was great.  We ordered calamari (delicious), chicken marsala (Bernie loved it and I thought it was super moist), and I had the fish and chips (very good).  I know, not the diet of a guy that needs to lose the same 20 pounds for the past 3 years! One of the highlights was the serve who delivered the food.  He made it a point to tell us the the 10% delivery fee went directly to him as a tip.  I always thought the company kept that.  I was so happy that I tipped him another 20%!   The guy was so nice, and afterwards he said, ""Thank you for your grace!""  Super cool, or maybe I'm super sensitive because I have 2 daughters now.

538,Nate H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,40,5.0,3.0,2012-02-28,"Generally I'm pretty happy with this place. The food is consistently good, as well as the service, usually. This time a group of 10 of us came in and were greeted by a very nice host. We then wandered into the bar and found a table where we were less than ""greeted"" by a very annoyed looking waitress. How dare we enter at 930 pm on a Sunday and sit in her section to celebrate my friends birthday! I'm a waiter myself and I understand that you may not always want to take a table later at night, but at least try and make me believe that you are half way excited that we are spending money and you will get the tip in the end. We try to make a joke or two to lighten the mood; no dice. At least the food runner had a smile on his face when he delivered the food, always a nice touch. Food tasted very good, as usual. had to try the hand crafted root beer this time. I'm not normally a soda drinker, but it was noticeably better than root beer from a soda tap, but falls short of A&W root beer at their restaurants. I think I'll just stick to their regular beer instead. The tatonka stout is a perfect complement to the pizookie at the end of the night. I usually feel 4-4.5 stars but this time felt more like 2.5 because of the service. It was just a one time flaw, next time I think will be nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=500,3.6,3.53,3.53,2.476,3.5580000000000003

It sucked!  For whatever reason, the wrap they use to fry their avocado in is extremely hard, doughy and dry.  Also, the sauce they use to go with their roll does not complement each other at all.   I also ordered chicken wings, and I would have to tell you to go to buffalo wild wings if you want some good wings.  I think it's good, but not as good as buffalo.  The BEST PART of the meal is always the dessert, and this is the only place you can find pizzokie!!!!  I got the trios, which is a great way to try different type of flavors.  I got the red velvet, macadamia nuts and white chocolate, and Oreo and cookies.   OMG! It was to die for!!!!  I love it!

290,Beachy K.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,41,,2.0,2012-03-22,"Typical mediocre corporate fare.  Low quality food and service.  If you're a big beer drinker (I'm not) than you may like the sportsbar atmosphere and drinks. But my friend and I agreed that the food appears to be an after-thought.  I've given them 2 chances: once in Chula Vista, when they screwed up our pizza order -- we ordered a deep dish with sausage, mushroom, and green peppers, and they brought us an incomplete pizza without tomato sauce and tomatoes -- that's like building a home without a foundation! The thing was as dry and tasteless as cardboard.   The next time we were in Laguna Hills (El Toro) and my date ordered the beef dip. which was stale bread with meager bits of mystery meat.  I ordered a salad and stuffed baked potato, which was disappointing because of the minimal amount of ingredients. $8 for basically a plain baked potato - ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=360,3.52,3.49,3.49,2.3440000000000003,3.5020000000000002

407,Alex G.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,14,2.0,2.0,2012-04-06,"This review is based off of two things: service and gluten free pizza.  Service- It was good, nothing great or special. I would give it 3.5 stars. Server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but managed to get us everything we needed. Our wait was 10 minutes longer than the quoted 15 minutes, meaning I probably should have grabbed a cocktail at the bar for the wait.  Gluten Free Pizza- eek, really not that great. At all. I was rooting for this, hoping it would be a new GF option for me. I would have preferred Udi's frozen pizza crust. I got the vegetarian pizza and added pineapple. The pizza was soggy in the middle, the crust was super thin and really should have been cooked longer. I ended up eating the olives, pineapple and the crust. Major disappointment. Will not be back to eat the pizza.

405,Erin T.,"Irvine, CA",189,396,22.0,3.0,2012-05-18,"I usually don't have high reviews for chain restaurants and this place is no exception... The food is isn't bad, it's just not spectacular. I honestly don't think there's anything unique about their menu - granted, I came here for lunch with some co-workers. What I can say though is that Bj's, and any other chain restaurant like it are great places for groups of people because there is something for everybody.  We tried the lunch menu and I liked the variety of it: there was pizza, salad, soup and sandwich combos, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, and tacos all for under $12. I chose the Mahi Mahi tacos. There wasn't anything stand out about it. It was a piece of under seasoned mahi mahi and cabbage in between a flour tortilla and served with a lime wedge. I am glad that it wasn't overcooked or undercooked though! It also came with small cups of Guacamole, salsa, and a side of multicolored tortilla chips. I really think the Mahi Mahi could have used a flavorful sauce. Chronic tacos serves theirs with a chronic sauce, which gives a pop to their tacos - Bj's just gave me a lime wedge and apparently wanted me to hide the fact that it's under seasoned with salsa and creamy guac. I may not be a Mexican food connoisseur but I'm pretty sure salsa and guac can't fix everything - even Albatross's tacos have some more flavor. Before I upgrade or downgrade the rating I will probably have to try some other things on the menu. I do think that the service could use some help. I understand that it is a Friday around lunch hour but it's near a lot of businesses, people only really have an hour to eat lunch...it should not take me 20 minutes to get my drink and order and another 20 minutes to get my food.... I'm not sure if it was the waiter's fault or if the restaurant just needs to streamline their lunch hour service - luckily for me my boss isn't a huge stickler for going over my lunch hour because I tend to stay later anyways, but for those who have people counting their every minute....this may not be the best choice for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=400,3.48,3.45,3.45,2.412,3.462
551,Michelle S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,17,,1.0,2012-06-12,"When I first arrived the hostess was on her cell phone and told me her shift was over so I should ""go seat myself"". After finally being seated by someone I ordered a turkey sandwhich without meat, which is what I usually order. They brought my sandwhich with bacon on it so I sent it back. Then they brought out another wrong sandwhich with the wrong bread and no cheese. The manager and waiter both came over and gave me this look like I was the crazy one and said ""but that sandwhich comes with meat"". I dont understand why they couldnt make a simple sandwhich. I told them dont bother trying to fix it again and I just wanted my check so I could go eat somewhere else. They had the nerve to charge me full price for the sanwhich that I couldnt eat because they made it wrong twice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=540,3.36,3.44,3.44,2.148,3.4080000000000004
199,Jenny Y.,"Irvine, CA",168,152,676.0,3.0,2012-06-22,"This is a pretty good BJ's. I think it tends to be slightly less busy than the BJ's in Tustin/Irvine, so you might have less wait time. The food and service is pretty much the same across both locations, so no real difference there. BJ's used to be our go-to place for big group dinners, but we've kind of gotten over it recently. They only take reservations for 12 people or more, and if you do have that big a party, you're usually seated outside and in my experience, the service has been pretty average/below-average out there. You might have two waiters serving you, but they tend to avoid checking on big parties and it takes a long time to get their attention if you need something. If your party is less than 12, I think you can find a better place for your dinner.  We came here on a Wednesday night with 7 people and were told that it was about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up only taking 20 minutes, which was nice. Unfortunately, we were squeezed into a booth that is really made for 4 people so we were kind of cramped and uncomfortable the entire night. I'm not really sure why they thought 7 people could fit into a 4-people booth, so watch out for that.  The food is always the same at BJ's - good selection of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, pasta, salads and entree dishes. The food is good, but tends to be high in salt and calories. Portion sizes are pretty big, so you might want to get a dish and share or else save half for later. I've always been a fan of their pizzas - I usually get the Classic Combo w/ pepperoni, sausage & mushrooms, or the BBQ Chicken Pizza w/ BBQ sauce, red onions, tomatos, cilantro and BBQ chicken. For pasta, I've tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta, which is good but really it's just your typical pasta you can find anywhere. They have some good lunch specials that are much more affordable, so if you can find time to go during lunch, I'd recommend that.  Recently, they have a new section on their menu called ""EnLIGHTened Entrees"" with dishes all under 575 calories. I've been experimenting more with this menu and so far I like what I've tried! I've tried the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta, which comes with roasted vegetables, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and Kalamata olives and is topped with pine nuts, basil, Parmesan cheese and parsley. It's a nice, light combination that fills you up. I've also tried the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi which is served with roasted pineapple fried rice, snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds. I am definitely a fan of the Mahi Mahi - perfect portion size, great mix of flavors, and the fish is delicious! It was a little dry but it still tasted really good, and I left feeling a lot better than my friends who ate 1,500 calorie burgers.  Of course they're known for their pizookies, so don't leave without getting one for dessert. My favorite is the oreo cookie or oatmeal raisin pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=240,3.28,3.44,3.44,2.476,3.3760000000000003

And that's not because BJ's ""the cumulative experience"" was truly 4-star, but because Erin was actually interesting, genuine, and attentive without being a bother. We only ordered a Frisco Burger, the common name for a burger on sour dough with cheese. It was OK, and satisfied. My wife had a chicken and rice entree, which I didn't care for. But she doesn't eat red meat, so if she likes ""any dish"" at a restaurant, we're in good shape.

477,Christina S.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,2,,2.0,2012-07-13,"We frequently visit this restaurant and the service and food are always great. However, during our past two visits the service has been TERRIBLE. The past two visits Ryan has been our server. He chooses not to write down orders which resulted in our food coming out incorrect during our visit a couple weeks ago. During tonights visit, he again chose not to write down the order and in a panic to get our rather lengthy order in the computer, he completely forgot to take my order (who happened to be the only pregnant female at the table). Miraculously our food came out correct, but refills and parmesan/pepper were never brought. After requesting cheese and peppers from Ryan, it was never delivered and I had to get up and ask the bartender for assistance. Ryan then asked if we wanted dessert in the middle of our meal, he then dropped the check without asking if we wanted any more beers. Once we ordered another beer, we waited a few minutes and the check with the charged beer was brought without the beer, We watched for 15 minutes as countless beers passed by our table and while Ryan continued to take care of other tables. We flagged him down to cancel the beer which he replied, ""yeuh""(not sure what that means). We then left the empty checkbook at the end of the table and Ryan asked if we wanted to split it down the middle. I was confused because we didn't receive a revised check. He then brought us THE SAME EXACT CHECK charged with the beer we never received. I immediately flagged him down and asked for the correct check, which we then received our first apology during our visit. Finally received the correct check and paid out. Extremely disappointed in the lack of attentiveness. All of us work in the industry, service of this caliber should not be tolerated.  I will return in the future, but I refuse to be waited on by Ryan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=580,3.16,3.42,3.42,2.3120000000000003,3.3160000000000007
256,Dominic G.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,52,13.0,1.0,2012-07-17,"And finally it is here, my first rant. See now, my friends know that I like to complain about things. A lot of things. Most things, honestly. But in my defense, I complain because sometimes I believe that things can be better. That things can work more efficiently and be more effective. Well, this is a perfect example of what occurred this past Saturday night: So all that week, I had been jonesin for some pizza. So where else would I go, besides BJ's Restaurant and Brewery in Laguna Hills. I hadn't had BJ's Pizza for quite awhile and was really excited to taste the deliciousness once more. I pulled up, parked my car, and walked into the restaurant. There was no wait, and my party got seated immediately, without any time wasted. This instantly struck me as strange, being that it was 8:00p.m. on a Saturday night; Yet, my mind moved on. I would find out later, why this was the case. After ordering the ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" pizza with added ""Buffalo Sauce"" and a side of fries, the ""Jeremiah Red Ale"" came and the night had begun (But damn, I didn't know it was to be the worst restaurant experience of my adult life). Let's get something straight real quick. I've worked at a restaurant at the Irvine Spectrum. I understand busy nights and 1-hour long waits. I understand who cooks the meals: the chefs, who takes my orders: the waiter/waitress, and who fixes issues: the manager. So for the entire meal, our server (Sadly, forgot her name), was good. She wasn't amazing, and she definitely wasn't bad. She was almost exactly what I want in a server. Now, she brought us the pizza, cut it for us, and I bit in. 'Damn I had made a good choice putting the buffalo sauce on the pizza', was the first thought in my head after I dove in. Twisting and smashing in my mouth, the bacon, ranch, chicken, sweetened crust, and buffalo sauce made me satisfied and left me without any buyers remorse. I take my third bite. Well, to put it plainly... I bit straight into a piece of metal. Initially, I had thought it was just a really crispy piece of crust. That was until I bit into it once more and it didn't budge, only hurt my tooth. Sadly, I spit out what was my beautifully tasting pizza, and find a piece of metal, no smaller than a BB-pellet. Clearly, and for reasons not needing explanation, that alone was bad. But the night had just begun. In the restaurant business, that's a huge deal, obviously. Nonetheless, I assume, and know, that these things happen. Thus, I wasn't angry at that point to be honest. As I've said before, I worked at a restaurant with non-stop traffic; So I understand that shit happens. But here's where things started to tail off... I told the waitress what had happened, and she immediately apologized and told me that she would bring the manager right over. 10 minutes later. No really, ten minutes is what I waited for the manager to come over. That, in and of itself, is ridiculous. To think that it took a manager of a restaurant, 10 minutes to a approach a customer who had just bitten into a piece of metal in a pizza made by one of his restaurants chef's, is baffling. That would have never happened at the restaurant I had worked at, let alone ANY respectable establishment. ""Oh, wow, yeah that's bad. I'll bring you gentlemen another pizza."" What you just read above, is all KEVIN (the worst manager I have ever met) said to me when he came over to see what had happened. He walked away promptly after he said the word, ""pizza"". (I didn't hear from KEVIN for the remainder of the meal, until... Well, you'll read)... But really? No, honestly. Really? I don't even have your respect to receive an apology. No sign of remorse that a customer had just bitten into a pizza that had a piece of metal in it. A piece of metal, that luckily didn't shatter my tooth. Jesus... How did you get your job, Kevin? Especially at this time, we have loads of unemployed members of society looking for work, who would be clamoring for your position, and this is how you act?

586,Ashley T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",66,25,,2.0,2012-08-11,"I like coming to BJs because it's easy in the sense that there's a broad menu and there's something for everyone here. I always have a good time when I sit up at the bar, but this last week I came in for lunch with a friend from college and sat at a table. Service was horrible. I ordered a glass of wine and both times it came out, the wine glass was completely dirty and gross. I work in restaurant... it's standard to polish wine glasses after washing them. I had ordered clam chowder to start, which was ok. I wish it came out with crackers (not sure if it's supposed to and the food runner forgot or if they don't offer them). We waited almost 30 minutes for our lunch to come after we finished our soup (which we ordered at the same time as the soup)... which isn't that big of a deal because we were catching up but if I was in a hurry since it was lunch time I would have been in trouble. I had ordered the half salad and flatbread off of the lunch menu, and asked to sub it with a ceasar salad and a side of ranch for the flatbread. They brought it out with a standard house salad with no dressing on it and no side of ranch. The server never came by to check how the food was, so I just sucked it up. But eating lettuce and carrots with no dressing is gross... I'm not that healthy. Also, throughout service our waitress took my friend's order and would begin to walk away without taking my own (this includes drinks and food). I get that he's good looking, but sweetheart I was hungry too! And I'm the good tipper... I work in the industry.

259,Anna F.,"Irvine, CA",23,20,2.0,1.0,2012-08-31,"I used to go to this BJ's every Thursday with part of my soccer team (usually 6-8 people), but the service has gotten so bad that we've decided to move on to a place that can get food to us in under an hour so we can enjoy the rest of the evening talking, instead of shoving food in our faces so we can get home in time to get some sleep. Tonight was the final straw. We were sitting in the bar area during happy hour, and the service was absolutely horrible. We were unlucky enough to get a new girl who looked like a deer in the headlights while she was trained by a guy who couldn't stand still to listen to an order. All I ordered was water and a thin crust pizza with mushrooms and olives. It took over half an hour to get my pizza, and when it got to me, it wasn't the Gluten-free thin-crust pizza that I ordered, it was the flatbread pizza from the appetizer menu, which isn't gluten free. When I asked the server to clarify what I was given, he said it was the flatbread, and that he didn't hear me say ""Gluten Free."" ... Okay... So I might not have said the entire ""Gluten-free Thin Crust pizza"" but I ALSO didn't say ""flatbread"" And at this point, I still didn't have my water. I had to ask for it three times, and it took nearly an hour to get it. When I asked him to take it back and fix the order, it took another 30 minutes to get it. I'm sorry, but when I'm at a restaurant, and THEY screw up my order, I expect the corrected order to get to me ASAP. I had to ask for a box to go by time it actually got to the table. And to top it off, I was charged full price. I'm not the type of person who sharks for free food when there is a mistake, but when that mistake has me sitting at a table for an hour and a half with no food, it's a little insulting to pay full price. Other problems with my group's experience is that someone asked for the cheese pizza bread from the smallbites menu and buffalo won-tons. She never got the won-tons (luckily, they weren't on the bill), but her pizza bread came out as a mini pizza, and then when she got the actually pizza bread, it had pepperoni on it.

I can't believe it's been only 9 days since I signed up for the rewards program and now I'm back tonight to redeem MORE points!!! :)  A disappointment that turned into a FREE appetizer! The Avocado Egg Rolls were seriously undercooked.  When we bit into it, a chunk of white flour was all stuck around the edges as if the oil didn't even touch it when they fried them. There was seriously an inch of flour all crusted around the edges of the egg rolls.  So we called the waiter who took the plate back... The Manager came and apologized. They made a FRESH NEW batch of the appetizer!!! This time it really was THE BEST BATCH of Avocado Egg Rolls ever!!! It was warm, crispy, chewy and packed w/avocado goodness!!!!  No sight of white flour :)  I ordered the EnLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango Salad. But I shared my concern w/the waiter because the first time I ordered this dish, I explained that the chicken was bland/rubbery/not tasty at all!! Kind of tasted like weird fake chicken or something.... So my waiter suggested that I substitute ""BLACKENED CHICKEN"" instead of ""Grilled"" chicken.  This time the chicken had a better flavor and did taste like chicken!!  Yay!! I was happy :)  Now onto our Mediterranean Pizza. It's a DEEP dish pizza or choose gluten-free. For some reason I didn't know that BJ's doesn't have  thin crust!?!?!!?   The crust was a little too thick for us as it was almost like eating bread. For 4 role the medium was more than enough to share...  The Mediterranean is interesting with sun-dried tomatoes, olives, peppercini, chicken, pesto sauce and cheese. it's really good but you can never go wrong with BJ's pizza!

252,Bettina K.,"Irvine, CA",68,24,4.0,2.0,2012-09-21,"Normally I love BJs but not so much after our take out experience this week.  We ordered online and the pick up time the site gave us was 1/2 and hour, so we got there in about half an hour and our food was cold. I understand take out won't taste as good as dining in, but come on for it to be that cold should not be normal.  We ordered spinach artichoke dip, the BBQ chicken salad and the BJs classic combo pizza. Spinach artichoke dip was cold and they barely gave us any in the to go carton. I've had it in the restaurant  before so I know that the serving size should be larger. The BBQ chicken salad was a major bummer because they forgot the crispy onions, that's my favorite part! They did a good job at not putting on the beans or tomatoes that I had asked to be left off the salad, but nowhere on the online order did we put no onions. So for 14 bucks it was a bland salad. The pizza was cold. Major bummer. There wasn't enough sauce so the pizza was dry and the pepperonis were not toasty like they normally are. It seemed like they rushed making the pizza. The vibe I got was that they rushed though our order and it was done way before our 1/2 hour time frame and that is why it was cold. I am giving 2 stars because my experience dining in had  been much better. For over 40 bucks our meal sucked and I wished we had gotten take out from somewhere else.

243,Hannah K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",148,85,21.0,3.0,2013-02-24,"I would recommend coming to Bj's only for lunch. Every time I come here for dinner my friends and I have to fight for a place in the bar area or wait hours for a table. The food and service is typically good but my last couple of visits to this particular Bj's have been a disappointment. Definitely would NOT get take out here again.  I placed my order online and they said my order would be ready at 6:50 (keep in mind this is 30 minutes away from when I placed my order). I got there maybe a few minutes before that time and when I went to pay the girl was having issues getting me the receipt I have to sign. She had to have the manager come and print it out. The girl said my order would be out any minute. I took a seat and by the register and expected my order to be there soon (I only ordered a simple soup and salad). Ten minutes passed and everyone that ordered a pizza got their order right away. I was kind of confused on how everyone was walking out with pizzas with no wait, but my soup and salad had taken 40 minutes to make now? I ended up waiting a total of 25 minutes for a freakin soup and salad! (plus the 30 minutes I waited at home) Finally the girl in charge of the take out told me she was going to go get my order and ran to the back. She was back there for about 5 minutes. I FINALLY got my order and when I got home I could tell they made my food in a hurry because my wedge salad had less than a teaspoon of each fixing (bacon, blue cheese, etc.) This entire take out experience has made me not really want to come to Bj's again. I paid 12$ for basically a head of iceberg lettuce cut in half and a cup of soup. I've ordered this before but ate in the restaurant and it was way better. I'm giving them 3 stars based on my past experiences and the food is good whenever I go there for lunch. It seems they need to be more organized and not be running around the place like chickens with their heads cut off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=340,2.52,3.05,3.05,2.38,2.8379999999999996
537,Savannah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,4,,1.0,2013-02-28,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. While the food and atmosphere are not bad at all, the customer service is HORRENDOUS!! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE #1 -  I've heard stories from a ton of my friends about how bad the service at this BJ's is, but I figured they were exaggerating.  I went to BJ's with a group of about 6 people after a rehearsal one night (probably around 10pm). The moment we walked in, the hosts were totally unprofessional and didn't seem to have any idea what they were doing. Seeing as I have worked in the restaurant business for the past 4 years, I usually have a lot of patience with restaurant workers, especially when they're busy, because I know how hard it can get. But it was not busy at all, and yet it took them 30 minutes to seat our ""large party"" of 6 people. Really?!  Once we were seated (and starving!!) it was probably another 10 minutes before we were finally greeted by a server. A server, mind you, who was the most terrible server I have ever had IN MY LIFE (And I've been to Europe!! lol). This girl was rude the moment she walked up to the table, rolling her eyes when we asked for waters, and very short with us. She didn't repeat our order back to us (which probably explains why she screwed it all up), and was just totally unpleasant. When our food finally did come out, pretty much every order was wrong in some way and one person in our group didn't get served any food at all. She didn't return to our table for another 15 minutes (even though we'd asked for refills after she dropped off our food) and when she finally did return, my friend let her know he didn't get his food (we all just ate our incorrect orders because we were so starving we stopped caring). Instead of doing the right thing any good server would do, apologize and fix the problem right away, this woman literally rolled her eyes at us and said ""ok, I'll buy your pizza then"" before walking away. I'm NOT KIDDING!!!!  Another 15 minutes later, she returned with my friend's pizza (the rest of us were done eating by now) and we reminded her for the 3rd time, that we wanted water refills. This girl literally turned around, grabbed a pitcher of water from another server, and SLAMMED it down on our table!!! (I'm not kidding, I though the glass was going to break) I was STUNNED. I don't care how busy you are or how bad your day was, there is NO EXCUSE for a server to behave so poorly. If she really hated her job so much, she should consider quitting. I left her no tip, but then wrote a paragraph on the back of the check (no joke) entitled ""TIPS on serving"" and made a list of everything she did wrong. I didn't want her to think we were just a group of teens who never tip, when I go out with my friends, I ALWAYS make sure a minimum of 20% is left for the server. This was the only scenario in which I left the server nothing. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE #2 -  OK, so now a few months have passed and I decided to give this BJ's another chance. This time, we were a much larger group (probably 10-12), it was late, after another rehearsal, on a Friday night. Hosts were, once again, terrible, but I was trying to stay positive and told myself they were probably new. Took a while to get seated, but since it was a busy night and we were a larger group, I wasn't bothered by it. When we finally got seated it -- once again -- took a good 15 minutes for our server to help us.  As soon as he approached the table, I let him know that my boyfriend and I were only getting an appetizer because we wanted to leave early (as an experienced server I can tell you that we prefer you tell us AHEAD of time if you want separate checks). I was doing this guy a favor by letting him know before he even took our order. This server was seriously (and I didn't think it possible) ruder than the female server I had dealt with our previous visit! He seriously had the worst attitude, and refused to split the check in any way shape or form. I told him, and I quote, ""How about you pretend me and my boyfriend are sitting at a separate table and are in no way affiliated with this group?"" He gave me a serious attitude and said ""company policy"" said they couldn't split checks (which is called bulls---, this server was just lazy and didn't want to deal with the hassle of splitting checks). After he stormed off, the whole table was so angry we actually just got up and left as he was bringing all of our drinks out. We went to In-N-Out across the street for better food, service, prices, and atmosphere (I'm serious) In conclusion - DON'T GO HERE. The service is so bad it's comical. I actual went back a few weeks ago just to see if any efforts have been made to improve service. The answer is no, it's still terrible. I blame management for obviously training their servers poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=500,2.52,3.05,3.05,2.116,2.8379999999999996

446,Mike P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,11,,1.0,2013-03-18,"Avoid BJ's Laguna Hills - Worst In The Chain! I've never seen a more poorly managed restaurant of this caliber.  The food is actually pretty good (we like the menu variety), but the service ranges from good to flat out horrific (in the gutter terrible), and there's no way to tell which service you're going to get on any given day.  Statistically, it's straight down the middle (50% good, 50% gutter service).  My wife and I came by for a meal after church one Sunday earlier this Month (March 2013), and it turned into one of those gutter service visits.  We had a young male waiter (I won't call him out here in public), who didn't have a clue what he was doing.  He took 10 minutes just to get us our drinks - but the worst part was that our pre-entree soup & salad (just one of each) took 30 minutes (I timed it, due to the inconsistent service we've experienced in the past).  At the 25 minute mark, I walked up to him (since he NEVER visited our table once after taking our order), to tell him that if the soup & salad didn't arrive in the next few minutes, we were simply going to leave.  He apologized and said he would check on it - 5 minutes later, he finally brought them to the table (at least the soup was hot and the salad was good).  He never visited our table after delivering the food - he didn't refill one of our drinks the entire time we were there.  When he finally presented the bill (there was no comp for the horrible service), we graciously left him a 10% tip, since we felt sorry for him, thinking he probably wouldn't have his job much longer. The real problem is the management - not one manager came by the entire time, and this ridiculously inconsistent service is an ongoing (several years) problem at this BJ's location.  I think we're cured of giving them more chances, but only time will tell.

105,Felix L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1021,558,15565.0,3.0,2013-03-23,"Good: 1. A handful of TVs are available by the booths, at the bar, and in the patio area. BJ's is a solid alternative to traditional sports bars for those who want to catch March Madness games without sacrificing on the food quality. I believe BJ's carries Direct TV network. 2. Plenty of seating, significantly more than the Tustin Marketplace location. The patio features open seating and can accommodate at least 10 large parties. 3. Lunch specials start from $5.95 (chicken quesadilla). A flatbread and salad is $6.95. Unlimited soup and salad is $7.50. A specialty lunch salad is $8.95. A variety of lunch size pastas is $1 off the regular menu price. You CAN get a lunch for under $10 here (under certain circumstances). 4. For health-conscious customers, I recommend the flatbread/salad lunch special (575 calories). The choices for flatbread included ""black and bleu"", ""roasted vegetables and goat cheese"", ""california club, ""fresh basil with italian sausage"", and ""margherita fresca"". I ordered a half margherita fresca flatbread and half mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The meal felt very light. All ingredients used were fresh.  Bad: 1. Flatbread was lukewarm. 2. Slow service. This is not an ideal restaurant to get in and out quickly for a quick lunch break. You need at least an hour for the entire experience. If you have less time, get take-out or look elsewhere. 3. Soft drinks were $2.95.

I know their beers have won tons of awards and the beer market is saturated but there was nothing that made that beer outstanding to me.  Everything else is predictable at BJs.

591,Carol M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,2013-07-03,"Tonight, we went out to celebrate our wedding anniversary & ate at BJ's pizza because we've always enjoyed eating there on a regular basis. We waited at our table for over 15 minutes before we had any type of service. We finally called someone over to take our order. When our pizza arrived, it didn't even look like the pizza that we normally order (BJ's favorite). We asked the manager who walked by if that was the pizza we ordered and she said that it was BJ's favorite. We showed the manager that our pizza had some spicy buffalo style chicken on it, which was not on the BJ's favorite ingredients. The manager said that we could get a different type of pizza if we wanted to exchange it. She did not apologize that the wrong ingredient was on our pizza and she did not seem to care. What if someone at our table was allergic to chicken?? We ended up just eating the pizza, which was dry and burnt on the bottom. Honestly, Dominos Pizza tastes better than this pizza did, but Dominos would be a lot cheaper. We were so disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants was so horrible tonight. Throughout the meal, the server was nice, but practically forgot about us for lengthy periods of time. At the end of dinner, we spoke to the manager and explained that we rarely ever complain about anything, but the meal was so below standard that we vowed never to eat there again. The manager did not seem to genuinely care at all. She did not offer any empathy at all. She said that she would talk to the people in the kitchen, but we saw her walk the other way. We were so disappointed, because we eat at this restaurant every few weeks. We were not given any discount or anything to compensate us for the horrible meal.

553,Stevo L.,"Newport Beach, CA",13,107,20.0,1.0,2013-09-15,"Let me start by saying that I used to be a regular customer here in the late 90s and early 2000s. Let me also say that I will never be a customer here again. Four of us showed up last night on a Saturday night to eat dinner. It was a celebratory dinner because one of us got a new job. We ordered a large pizza, a flatbread, and a salad. The food took 45 minutes to arrive. I understand Saturday's can be a little bit busy so we can certainly give that part a pass. When the food arrived, the pizza and the flatbread were lukewarm. If you do the math, the pizza would be the last thing to come out of the oven and the flatbread shortly before that. This would indicate to me that our food just sat there for God knows how long. We couldn't find the waitress for a while because she was somewhere out of view. Once we called her over, we advised her of the problem with our food. She said that she would bring the manager over. In the meantime, she offered us dinner rolls to hold us over. The manager apologized when she arrived and said that the pizza would only take about 10 minutes to cook again. We decided that seeing as we were having some good conversation we would wait another 10 minutes to bring up the pizza and the flatbread. The server brought two rolls for our party of four and said to us that they did not have any other rolls ready. As you could've guessed by now, these rolls were stale. It took another 45 to 50 minutes to receive our pizza. Once the pizza and flatbread arrived, they screwed up the toppings on the pizza. Obviously at this point in our in 45 minutes into our supposedly all we decided to take the pizza to go. My wife ate by herself for most of this meal and they decided wisely to comp us for the food. The server came by again and told us the manager would come visit us before we left. 15 minutes later the manager had not come by and we left. Before I wrote this review, I noticed that other people have had the same experience with food not making it out to the restaurant in an expeditious fashion. I sure hope the owners or the managers read this review, because people will be dropping like flies if they were treated like we were. Never again at this location. I have had many good experiences at other BJ's in the past. Unfortunately will never go back to this one again. There are several things wrong with this restaurant in our experience. The first thing is that once our food took to long to make, someone should've expedited our order. Once our food was up, the manager should've delivered the food and/or made sure that the order was correct. For the server to offer us dinner rolls was inappropriate, because we were waiting for pizza not rolls. Maybe offer an appetizer. It is pretty obvious that the server let our food sit the first time and did not check it the second time. The manager not showing up the second time was just unsatisfactory. Just to make sure that BJ's corporate offices are aware of this, I am cutting and pasting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=540,2.68,2.72,2.72,2.372,2.704

The interior of the restaurant looks a lot better here than it does back at home in terms of elegance, at least with that huge, pretty lamp that you see hanging from the ceiling when you first enter the restaurant. One sad part was before my sister cancelled on us that she could not make lunch with us, she still reserved us a table and the staff STILL made us wait 10 minutes until we could be seated. Um, isn't the point of a reservation so you don't have to wait at all? I was pretty upset with that, especially when we were coming all the way down from a tiring roadtrip. When we got to our table, I noticed that the utensils were not even on the table and I had to request them when we got our meal. No biggie, but just something to point out for others. Also, I just got the vibe that the workers seemed very disorganized or not confident in their work, as they seemed to forget things a lot. In other words, we'd be kept waiting for a while until we could actually take our order, receive our order, etc. I thought this was a little bit unnecessary, especially when I felt that it wasn't even that packed when we got there. The food though was good, like always whenever I dine at BJ's. I got my famous Avocado Eggrolls, which tasted amazing. We also ordered a California Pizza Flatbread (my boyfriend loved it), chicken quesadilla (which tasted bomb), and a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie (tasted like perfection).

Six rolls vastly separated around the sauce bowl. (Tip to BJ's: use a smaller plate or put another 2 egg rolls to the plate.) + The server came by our table to inform us they were out of baked potato. (Tip to BJ's: please communicate with staff. The customers need to know before/when ordering a meal if their side or main dish is not available.) - Main courses were great: Steaks with horseradish mashed potatoes. The sprinkling of the parsley around the plate is unnecessary; if you've ever watched 'Kitchen Nightmares with Chef Gordon Ramsey,' you'd be scared of plates with parsley scattered all over the plate. No need to decorate/garnish the plate with all the wasted parsley because the food should be the art. + The main reason for heading to BJ's was for dessert: bring on the pizookie!!! We asked to see the menu so we could see the choices and the server just stood there. He said there was no need for it and recited the options from memory; impressive but come on, you really aren't going to give us a menu and a minute to decide? Talk about pressure. - He asked us if we needed a to-go box and said he'll be right back. But about 10 minutes later our dessert arrived and the guy  asked if we wanted a box. I told him that our server was getting one but never came back. The guy was really kind and brought back a box and also cleared our stacked up dishes. + I like how the rest of the servers try to pick up the slack of your main server. My generous tip was for everyone combined. However, if I had to give a single tip to our main server, I would have given the minimum. This location has slowly gone downhill.

Via the ever changing servers, we had to request menus, silverware (twice), napkins and water.  Before we even got the menus, we were asked if we were ready to order?! We waited forever for our entree's and then when they did arrive it was obvious the meals had sat under hot lights for way too long.. the sad crispy vegetables and dry overcooked salmon were barely edible.  When I mentioned it, the server apologized and explained there had been a kitchen backlog (?) and said he'd send the manager straight out.  Over the next 20 minutes he repeated the same thing FOUR times but she never appeared.  We were eventually told they would remove the charges for the salmon meals and offer a free dessert.  We accepted and then had to ask to see dessert menus.  Another ten minutes later, one menu arrived for our party of seven. Even after I told the server that it had been the worst service and meal we'd eaten in a very long time and that I felt the manager should have made an effort to come out, she still didn't bother.  I also asked for the table to be cleared ready for dessert but it never happened..they just set the plates down where-ever they'd fit amongst the dirty plates.

But this review is about my last experience there.  I ordered their root beer like I always do, along with a couple appetizers and a pizza. Well, at the end of my meal, the bottom of the root beer glass broke off and root beer spilled ALL OVER my lap. The manager came over and explained to me that every now and then the glasses crack when somebody puts a warm glass inside the fridge. Uhh okay, so why do your employees keep putting warm glasses in the refrigerator if this is a common occurrence?  I am giving 2 stars because she deducted the pizza from our check, however she did not apologize for the situation, only deducted the pizza and nothing else from our check (not even the root beer!).  The only reason I am unsatisfied with that, is because I went to Ritz Carlton one time, and the server accidentally spilled wine in my lap. The manager came over, apologized profusely, and deducted our ENTIRE $300 check. At BJ's, you only get a $20 pizza deducted from your bill, and not even the root beer that the caused the whole fiasco in the first place.

I don't drink, but the host asked if I wanted to sit at the bar since I was alone, and it made since so that I wouldn't take a whole table for myself. I first got there and I sat down I did get greeted right away, I think what went wrong was when I asked for a ""none alcoholic"" drink. Bartenders need to have a good knowledge of a few of theses in there bag. I told her to make whatever be creative. She comes back to me with a frozen drink with a big piece of pineapple and whip cream, my first thought was I should have been more s specific when I ordered, second this was a big slap in my face. It's cold out for one and I'm clearly not a girly guy, but since I don't drink alcohol I guess this is what I get!  So moving on I ask for a menu, my whole purpose for coming there, did I mention I'm a first time guest?! , sorry It slipped my mind. Anyway I try to order an app three people walk by me with my menu in front of me for at least 10-12 mins I know this because that's  how much time the game had left. And I know to watch the time when I'm noticing that service is lacking.  I finally get some attention from a tender and she took the order, food came out and when it hit the table I placed my dinner order, the Flatbread was good, by the time I finished 5-8 mins later my dinner was in front of me. This is when I could not believe the service. I was never asked how was the food while eating, never offered salt and pepper, and NEVER asked for a refill on my drink, or offered water!! .   I ate my entire dinner without one sip of a drink! Wow.  It seems that the tenders knew what they were doing because I heard one say"" She don't care if I don't get anything"" and that's  exactly what I left for a tip Nothing! Places like this can be great, but can also fall short.   The bar was not packed and I can see why a Friday night at 9 pm?!! Late night should have a draw, but with service like this well I see why the bar is empty early.  Ps. Doing side work at 9 pm and not giving guest or should I say me the proper attention probably lead to this review. BJ's I wish u well.  But you will never get a hard earned buck from me again!  Pas.

The atmosphere was great and we we super hungry and excited to have a nice dinner. We put in our names and waited patiently. After waiting about 20 minutes, a nice couple sitting in the bar area (free seating) flagged us over and asked us if we would like to take their booth because they were getting ready to leave. We gladly took the seat and handed our ""buzzer"" to someone else who had been waiting for a long time. We then sat in the booth for about another 15-20 minutes and watched out waiter completely ignore us. As he stopped in our area only a couple times to collect checks from a few other customers, nobody came to greet us, give us a menu, a glass of water....nothing. The seating in the bar area was pretty well ignored by him in general. All the while, the couple to whom we gave our own buzzer was now seated and enjoying their service. Very hungry and a little irritated at this point, my boyfriend walked up to the host's table, explained the situation, and if we could be placed in front of the line to be re-placed into the normal seating area. The host told him that, if we wanted, she would say something to our waiter about it but we would have to wait again if we wanted to be re-seated.

564,Tamara C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,40,,1.0,2014-03-22,"Let's just say from the most recent experience my friends and I had on March 3, 2014 I will not be going back. The food was way under par except for the pizza and the service was absolutely horrifying and embarrassing for an establishment as big as this one. Here's how it went down:  My boyfriend and a couple of our friends decided we would go to BJ's since we hadn't been there in a couple of years and wanted to enjoy ourselves after a stressful day.  It was a Monday night so we assumed it wouldn't be too busy.  We were seated right away which was a nice start to the evening.  Our waiter came to our table to get our drinks and we could barely understand him. This was not a good thing since he was our waiter, but were still optimistic that nothing would go awry.  My boyfriend ordered an alcoholic beverage and we got a round of water.  After 15 minutes my boyfriend still did not have his drink.  Apparently, we were sitting at a table labeled ""ignore us"" or something because every time we tried to flag a person down to help us they would just walk right on by without even making eye contact.  There was finally a waiter that attended to the drink situation and he brought it right away. This was rather frustrating and who should have to wait for a beverage for 15 minutes?  We were finally ready to order our food, but the waiter seemed to be MIA (missing in action).  He finally showed up and we placed our food order which was a mini sweet pig pizza, a burger with an added side salad. Once again we could barely understand him.  When he left I commented to the table that I thought things were going to go downhill from here on out and they all agreed.  We also felt like he was thrown on the floor from working int the back or something.  Our food took so long to get that we looked like we were going to gnaw each others arm off or something.  My friend's burger was okay, but the fries that came with it were atrocious (like many days cold and stale). We all commented that McDonald's fries were better.  The burger came with a side salad and it was the saddest sloppiest looking salad ever made. It seriously looked like it was dumped out of a packaged bag with the dressing was dripping off of the little cup it was in.  We all commented that Carl's Jr. made better salads.  The mini sweet pig pizza I ordered was the best thing ever!  It was made perfectly and tasted fabulous!  By this time we just had to get the manager regarding our experience so far.  That even took awhile to flag someone down to get the manager for us. The manager did attend to us and was super nice at first about our complaints.  We were quite frank with her and told her the service sucked, our waiter was MIA and the food was below par.  She offered pizookies on the house which we welcomed appreciatively. That even went awry. While waiting for our pizookies our waiter decided to appear and ask us how our meal was. My boyfriend made a snippy sarcastic comment that went something like, ""Oh! So nice of you to show up again after being MIA the whole night!  I felt it was necessary to add that we already spoke with the manager.  I mean who does this when our meal was already done?  That WAS NOT impressive at all.  The pizookies that came to our table were mini ones and were not the right ones we ordered.  Our waiter came to our table and said they knew about the mistake and the correct pizookies would be coming out shortly. The pizookies we got were tasty, but by this time we just wanted to leave. We finally got our check and there must have been a miscommunication with the manager because the side salad was not taken off like it should have been and it was not $2; it was $6.  What a nightmare! So we got the manager once again and reconciled this matter, but our manager turned from nice to snippy (kinda mean)  in two seconds flat and that new adjusted receipt came out so fast it was like magic after we waited such a long ass time for everything else.  We also did not feel our waiter deserved a tip so none was given.   Talk about a nightmare, an embarrassment and a true disappointment for an establishment like this.  I feel like the loudness of the restaurant, not enough training and short staff play factors in the horrifying service and mistakes that are made. I feel like good food and service should go hand in hand.  It's unfortunate that the service is that horrendous because the food is pretty good. For all the food lovers out there BEWARE and BE WARY of what you are walking into if you decide to dine here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=480,2.52,2.6,3.02,1.924,2.568

Server #2 asked us how everything was going -- 20 minutes later -- and we asked for napkins (note that we hadn't been given napkins OR utensils, before OR after receiving our food). Took server #2 15 minutes to come back with the napkins. Took him another 15 minutes to come by and ask us if we needed anything else. We ordered dessert, which came in a reasonable amount of time, and with the check. It took another 15 minutes for someone to come and take our payment. This whole time, we watched both of our servers repeatedly visiting, checking on, and chatting with other tables. I counted several servers, and it was a quiet Tuesday night, so we can't exactly chalk up the neglect to being understaffed; I can only assume that they didn't take us or our business seriously because our bill wasn't going to yield them a substantial tip.

420,Ted S.,"Lake Forest, CA",199,448,970.0,2.0,2014-07-26,"I would recommend not going to happy hour with food in mind.  As an afterthought perhaps, but just that.  Basically, the offerings are not at all good. Drinks: $5 cosmos is not a bad deal, and they tasted okay, but came out unchilled.  That was strange but, again, not bad. The lemon drop martini was basically lemonade with no hint of noticeable alcohol, so scary if you don't know it's in there.  Gin martini was okay too, but kind of meh. Sliders: plain little burgers.  Not bad, but not special either. Kind of boring, with lettuce and pickles on the side.  The fries that came with them weren't bad. Calamari: $10.25. Not on the happy hour menu, but we ordered it because we like calamari.  It was all tender and good, but the batter was only a little crispy on the tentacled pieces.  The rest of them had soft batter, like they had been sitting out for quite some time. The tartar sauce was pretty good, but I didn't care for the warm marinara sauce.   Southwestern spring rolls: Why is it that anything around here that has ""southwest"" in it's description has the exact same flavor no matter what it is? These looked great, and were fried to a nice crispiness, but I took one bite and put it back.  Cumin anyone?  Blah. Mini pizzas: Doughy, not at all hot.  How can you make a fresh pizza and have it come out with cheese that's already congealed and separated from the ingredients underneath? Why aren't the tomato bits and sausage fused with the cheese?  We had both a pepperoni and sausage and a BJ special.  Both were pretty bad.  I think they must do a pre-thing to them for happy hour. The pepperoni and sausage were both standalone bland.   I've been to BJ's other times, not for the happy hour, and I don't recall not liking anything before. In this case I really didn't like much of anything, except for the calamari, which wasn't really that good either. On the pizza, we agreed that Little Caesar's was better (I don't like Little Caesar's), and you get a whole pizza there for the same price as this tiny, soft, miserable thing. Not to knock BJs as a whole, but don't expect good eats for happy hour.  Go for the drinks, and order from the regular menu for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=140,2.32,2.57,2.884,2.3440000000000003,2.4699999999999998

The service was sloooow!!  We were sitting on the outside patio during happy hour, however they don't honor happy hour prices unless you're sitting in the bar.   My boyfriend and I were seated at a table with my sister and her husband.  When ordering dessert, they got theirs but we didn't get ours.  I LIVE for dessert so I was extremely disappointed that the waiter never put in the order. Our relatives on the table next to us had Chardonnay added on their bill even though no one ordered it.  *** DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TAB!! *** I handed my Premier Rewards card along with my credit card when paying the check.  The waiter didn't add in my reward points, so I had to go online to enter it myself.  I don't know if he was just lazy, didn't care, or was new.  In any case, he got a 10% tip from us for the crappy service, and he's lucky he got that much from us since our bill was nearly $100.

The servers are extremely nice and helpful.  On my most recent visit I came with my family on Saturday night. Three of us eat gluten free (two of us have an allergy) and the fourth does not eat gluten free. I made it very clear that I have an allergy to gluten and cannot eat it, so I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce. Their fries share a fryer with breaded items, so they are not gluten free (luckily the server knew this), so I got a side salad. The server was also educated about what salad dressings contain gluten. There was some sort of mix up in the kitchen though because my burger came out with bun, but we pointed out the mistake and they quickly fixed it. The waitress came over and apologized then the manager came over and apologized as well.  They don't have the most gluten free options, but they do have pretty solid selections (including GF pizzas and pizookies - both delicious)!

577,Todd V.,"San Diego, CA",37,31,15.0,3.0,2014-08-30,"Tried the location in Laguna Hills off El Toro road when I was in the area for work. Came at 12:15 at the peak of lunch hour busyness. The lunch specials were very reasonably priced and offered many different items including sandwiches, soups salads and pizzas. They even had a lower calorie/fat menu for lunch. I chose the half a pizza and salad. The pizza was a bacon and tomato with a healthier white sauce for under 500 calories. Food was pretty good, not knock-your-socks-off good but worth the price. Here was my issue, service was horrible. After we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to drink almost immediately. Our drinks came fairly quickly and then we didn't see our server for 10 minutes. After she returned to take our order we didn't see her again for at least another 15 minutes. In this time another server brought us our food and refilled our drinks but only after we flagged her down looking for our server. I was glad she helped but if we didn't flag her down we would have waited while our food got cold and had nothing to sip on. When our server came back we asked for ranch and crushed red pepper. She brought back ranch and no crushed red pepper and proceeded to ask ""if were good"". At this point I gave up because our food was already half done and cold waiting for our simple items. I understand servers have to take breaks and such but in the peak of lunch service when you know people have to go back to work this should never be happening. Maybe if I am around another BJ's I may end up trying it again for lunch because the food is pretty good and I'm sure the service can't be like this everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=480,2.88,2.63,2.86,2.604,2.7299999999999995

The BBQ chicken pizza was not a BBQ chicken pizza from BJ's.The pizza had bbq sauce under some tomatoes and in between what was basically a big loaf of bread.  I asked for thin crust, could have gotten better pizza from dominoes. The salmon i ordered came with a white sauce, rice pilaf and veggies. The salmon I received had asparagus and quinoa with some nasty cherry cough syrup sauce. I called in as soon as I noticed, the guy on the phone was unprofessional to say the least. He told me to come in for my correct order, no apolology, nothing else. I called back to speak to the manager, who offered to have the order corrected or she could give me a voucher for the next time. She also told me she would come speak to me when I returned to get the correct order. I arrived 15-20 minutes later and expected the food to be ready like they said it would.

They however had so many excuses for all the problems that were going on.    First of all 3 of us in my group have been sick all night from what were thinking is because what we ate we all had the same thing, the new Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. We have been in the bathroom all night and 2 of us are still  in bed sick with major stomach aches. First of all when we got are food all of us had different dishes for are side rice thingy, I had the smallest square dish with very little in it, my friend had a soup cup full, and my daughter had what looked like a small soup bowl. The dish was so spicy I couldn't even eat it, the chicken was cut up so small I am not kidding 3 1/2 pieces of the smallest pieces of chicken I've ever seen, and had pepper sauce covering it. I had to scrape it off so at least I could eat my pita. Which this morning I wish I never ate, I haven't felt this bad in a long time.   My other friend had the spaghetti and meatballs that were stone cold, the pasta was so nasty looking it was stuck toghter and hard, I think we were just pretty much done at that time. She didn't say anything when the waitress came to check on us but that's mostly because she checked on us about 20 minutes after we got our food and the kids were ready for dessert.    At that time I overheard the table behind us complaining about there food too, which to me was kinda nice we weren't the only one with crappy food. Even though I know it's so not ok everyone is suffering with crappy food. There waitress told them she was sorry when she came into work, it was just a big mess everything that could go wrong seemed to be going on. I have to say not the best thing to tell your customers, but at least you know it's just need not your table.   The kids were so happy to get there pizokies, however when they came it looked like they had dumped milk on top, I said what's with the white puddle on top, she said someone left the ice cream frezzer open and all the ice cream is melted, really? There serving warm cookies with melted ice cream, was this a joke?? Where was management, why didn't they step in and at least tell there staff to let people know before they ordered that the ice cream is melted and your dessert is going to look like crap.

After eating here I have to tell you...I wish we had just gone elsewhere. The salad I ate sits in my stomach like a brick and I had to take a few Rolaids to aid the pain in my gut. If you were to judge this place on appearance alone I would give it 5 stars. However, we don't visit a restaurant for the appearance alone.  I had the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. First of all the salad was mushy. Lettuce, tomatoes, Jicama, tortilla strips, black beans, corn blended together in a BBQ-Ranch dressing. It sounds like it should be great right? Far from it...Imagine all of these ingredients mixed together into a mushy, unappetizing mess in a salad bowl. It tasted OK overall but maybe just because I was hungry. Maybe if they mixed this all together with about 50% less dressing it would be better. Maybe if the lettuce were not limp and lifeless and almost ""water logged"". I can't put my finger on why this salad was so bad. All I know is that I sit here with my belly still aching from that mistake. It does not stop there. My son ordered a burger...a double deluxe burger. It comes with 2 patties, bacon, cheese, etc. He says the meat was crumbly, the bread was almost soggy and overall the burger was super greasy. He also is experiencing a sore belly on account of this meal.  The place was packed so they must be doing something right. Maybe the beer is great and maybe the appetizer/bar food is good. However, I can tell you that we will not be returning to this restaurant for lunch or dinner anytime soon.

In the past, we always started with the Avocado Egg Rolls. They changed the recipe about a year or so ago so we stopped. I had a craving for them so we decided to give it another try. They were worse than the the last time. Very mushy inside with no flavor and didn't look anything like the picture.We also ordered the wings with extra hot sauce, celery, and bleu cheese instead of Ranch, the Italian Market Tavern-Cut pizza, and the Chipotle Fries. The wings came to us cold and the Italian pizza came without the meatballs. We brought this to the attention of our server who looked at it for a few moments searching for the meatballs. He then replied that our pizza accidentally went to the wrong table and he picked up this pizza.  I really don't like when the server lies to cover up for someone's mistake. He could have just acknowledged the error. He then brought the correct pizza which tasted okay. The Chipotle Fries were just unedible. My friend ate them because he was hungry but that's where I drew the line. We paid the bill and on the way out I spoke with the manager who really didn't seem to care. No apologies, sincere or otherwise. I am now looking for a new meet up restaurant who has higher standards than BJ's.

We didn't order drinks so maybe he didn't take us seriously. We were also the only non white table, so maybe that's why.  My boyfriend and I ordered appetizers, and he cut us off and left before anyone else could even order. Seriously. He didn't even bother to ask if anyone else wanted anything. Then, he spilled water on our table and didn't apologize. We always had to flag him down when we needed something, and when he did come around, he always seemed irritated and had a permanent scowl on his face. IF I WAS THE JOKER, I WOULD PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE OF YOURS! He was always smiling and joking around with all the other tables, so I guess he just doesn't like mixed race tables. Prick. Then when it was time to order dessert, my friend asked to see a menu. He tossed the little triangle that's already at the tables at her and said that's all they have, which is NOT true because they only had pizookies featured on there. So I told him we wanted to see a regular menu because we wanted something other than pizookies. Finally we were fed up so we told the manager what happened, and she also did not care at all. She just started at us with a confused look on her face. Worst management I've ever encountered. It's no wonder he's such a terrible server!

We were seated fairly quickly, within 5 minutes and when the waitress came over to take our drink order, we were ready to place our actual food order.  My one friend got her side salad within the next few minutes however it took an additional 20 minutes for us to get the rest of the entrees delivered. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken Salad.  The salad looked a little underdressed however there was a lime wedge on the plate so I used that.  I ate roughly half of the salad before the waitress returned to see how we were / if we needed anything, etc.  Upon her checking in, I asked for a side of dressing.  Once I got the dressing, I realized that there was nothing previously on that plate which matched that color or flavor - my salad wasn't previously underdressed, there was no dressing at all.  Now that I'm thinking of it, the salad didn't have chicken on it either.  There was plenty of lettuce, mango strips and avocado but I was so distracted by the lack of flavor, I didn't realize that chicken, a key ingredient, was not present... During the course of the service, we were never offered any refills and it took us maybe another 15 minutes (post dressing issue) before we could flag our waitress back down and get the bill.  The food did have flavor (when served as ordered) but post lunch rush, there's no reason for it to have taken 90 minutes to get one salad for myself, one baked potato / side salad for a co-worker and one burger / fries entree.   I would not recommend if you are limited on time.  There was no sense of urgency and there were plenty of empty tables, even directly in our section.  The service left something to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=200,2.84,2.73,2.748,1.7320000000000002,2.774

Our pizookie came out before our pizzas. We asked if they could just keep it in the kitchen for a few minutes until the pizzas came. Salina told us no cause it's last call even though other tables were still ordering food around us. It was so rude. We got our pizzas after being forced to eat dessert before dinner.

The thin crust pizza was called in the steak was rare when ordered medium.  The server took the food to the back and brought it out after being cooked some more. The pizza was now as hard as a cracker and jokingly, I balanced a knife on one side while holding the other and it did not bend or break. The steak was still cooked rare. The server brought out some french fries to hold us over while the food is a remade. These were also overcooked and taste burnt. They were darker than the other french fries on the table from another order.

And another group was seated there and stated 'oh there's a fork here.' We ordered our appetizer, chicken potstickers, and wanted to order our meal but our server just walked off to input the order. So we sat and waited. Once getting out potstickers both my cousin and I were so excited yet very disappointed as soon as we bit into them. They were cold and the plates were dirty. So we returned them and asked for a new set. Well out main course came out before we got our new order of potstickers. We were told 'they were given to a different table.' Out main courses were delicious and great temperature. But then again once we got our potstickers, they were cold again. Plus on top of it all I had to ask for a refill on my water that had been gone before my meal arrived. Then when refilling our waters our server almost spilt the whole pitcher on my cousin. Also I overheard the table next to us (dirty table) return one of there meals because a tomato bisque was brought out and not chili.  So did our server piss off the kitchen?

616,Simone K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,22,10.0,3.0,2015-08-05,"*GLUTEN FREE REVIEW In short the 3 stars are for the limited options of gluten free foods. The quality of the food and menu is extensive for customers who don't have the specific allergy I have, and the food was cooked to my liking and my mother will not allergies LOVES this place.  My mother and I ate dinner here last night and I have nothing to rave about but I wasn't disappointed.  To start off it is always really nice when a location recreates a menu for gluten free customers, which BJs does. The menu doesn't have many gluten free substitutes but there are options. The menu consisted primarily of soups, salads, and meat.  My mom, who is not gluten free, ordered a salad and loved it. She has a full second meal from the leftovers.  I ordered a sirloin with my two sides as the tomato bisque soup and broccoli. I asked for the soup prior to my meal which was no problem and it was DELICIOUS. I'm not sure if this was intentional or just by chance but the soup was perfect temperature. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but it drives me nuts when soups arrive WAY to hot to eat. The steak was cooked perfect, medium rare to my liking, but taste wise wasn't much different from any other steak I've ordered. Broccoli is, well, broccoli.  For dessert my mother and I shared a gluten free pizookie which was really good and amazing that they had a gluten free option.  Again, all in all, I can't RAVE about the dinner, primarily because I am now gluten free. I know if I had eaten here before my gluten allergy came about I would be SO thrilled with all the menu options!! Gluten allergies are a tough one.  I would come back here,but not frequently due to the small menu option for my allergy, which is why I gave 3 instead of 4 stars.  They do also have gluten free beer, which isn't common in most restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=180,2.56,2.7,2.612,2.38,2.644

When our pizza came they didn't bring plates and we waited for almost 5 minutes for them to bring some. By then the pizza was barely warm.   We finished off dinner with a pizookie that came to our table after a very long wait and the cookie wasn't even warm.

They attempted to melt cheese and place toppings on top of the burnt cheese and pizza so we wouldn't notice, but when u picked up The pizza the entire top fell off. It was disgusting and we were baffled that they would even serve something like that. We had it sent back ( which we never do) and it came out 25 minutes later. By that time half of the party was already finished eating. The other two pizzas were not burnt but had no flavor and were cold. We were not compensated anything.

It wasn't spicy at all, if any of you were wondering.   I was not a big fan of the Santa Fe spring rolls, but if you like southwestern flavor, this might be up your ally.  The shrimp scampi was okay.  It has a decent helping of shrimp.  It also has more tomatoes than I would like in a meal, and I honestly think it could do without the breadcrumbs.  I probably wouldn't get this again.

234,Emily P.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,,2.0,2015-10-14,"Let me start by saying I never write bad reviews. Being a server myself, I am usually overly understanding when it comes to mediocre service if I see that the server is working hard and doing their best. But our service today was inexcusable. Our first server was fine. No complaints with him. But our second server was a little less than friendly and clearly took into account that my boyfriend and I are in our early 20s and not buying alcohol. It was completely evident that we were being ignored/avoided. When our pizza came out wrong, there was no apology, she just took it away and said she would bring out another one. Which is fine if she was busy, but I could tell she was not. She meandered about her 4 tables (I counted) and spent all of her time tending to the tables full of older couples throwing back their beers and racking up their bills. It was obvious that she wasn't wanting to help us at all seeing as how we waited 5 minutes for ranch and sat with our drinks empty for 15 minutes until we decided to leave, still parched. I understand that we were only their for a quick snack and didn't have the biggest check, but we still deserve to be served with a decent attitude and with some sort of alertness, if not only to get us out quicker to get a bigger table in our place. Even as we walked out, we walked right by her and she looked us both in the eyes and continued past us without a single standard ""have a nice night"" or ""thanks for coming in"". It is a shame that our bad tip will be chalked up to our young age rather than her blatant lack of service. I love Bjs, but I will not be back to this location anytime soon if Clarissa is on the floor.

Gave us our waters & didn't see her til our orders came out. We ordered the lemon pepper wings & a large pepperoni & mushroom pizza. Once the food came, we ate. Wings actually didn't taste like they seasoned it at all & the pizza was ok. If you're craving deep dish, it'll do. She never refilled our waters though.

The broccoli cheddar soup looks unappetizing but is actually really good.  I chose the classic baked potato. It's good but could be a little warmer.  My friend was so full from her soup that she's taking the veggie potato home for dinner which is a plus.  Overall the service was good but the quality or the restaurant has definitely gone down.

I will never return to this restaurant(?)!  We both ordered the luncheon special:  a southern fried chicken breast/gravy, mashed potatoes, corn succotash, with a side wedge salad.  The wedge salad was unlike any I had ever had.  It had a runny blue cheese-like dressing, chopped white onions (rather than green), no chopped egg, and...worst of all...when I cut into mine, I discovered the big core of lettuce attached! The main entrée wasn't much better...the mashed potatoes and succotash were good; however, the piece of whatever part of the chicken on top was uneatable!  I tried to cut into the tiny thing trying to find an eatable bite, to no avail.  It actually resembled the tail of the chicken, coated, and deep-fried.  My Daughter's looked about the same.

While the food was just alright, I kept getting smelling hints of what I can only describe as sour dirty dishwater or a dirty oven, but I couldn't tell what it was. About half way through eating my food, it was really starting to bother me so I smelled my silverware and that seemed fine, then I smelled the food and was able to hone in on the deep dish pan itself. The pan had a lot of char on the outside which is what I presume was holding the odor. I had my friends at my table smell the dish and all agreed it had a funk to it. So I asked the waitress if it was typical, and she even smelled the dish, and by the look on her face I think she agreed. She showed her manager that happened to be walking by and he smelled it and said it was fine, nothing wrong with it and that its maybe just the char on the outside of the pan. However, I was amazed he didn't acknowledge the smell, and he continued and walked away. I had the waitress take the dish away because I had lost my appetite from the smell of the dish Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the waitress who provided great service and was nice enough to offer a pazookie  to our table, but someone else at my table took it instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=360,2.56,2.67,2.62,2.248,2.6260000000000003

369,Matt R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-06,"Visited on a late Sunday afternoon, restaurant was semi-busy. We we're told 5 mins, turned into 20 mins. We were looking forward to the meal so the wait was not an issue. The young, petite, Mexican hostess took the 2 of us to a table in the middle of the dining area, I asked if we could get a booth & it went downhill from there. After she took a deep breath, she turned around & kicked the chair & proceeded to tell us yeah we could go over to a near by booth. You would have thought this effected her in some way. My wife & I were both blown away by her actions & it made both of us feel very uncomfortable. She threw our menus down & walked away without a word. While waiting for our server we could see the hostess telling over server we had moved from the table to the booth, again very uncomfortable. And to top it off the booth was in the same section as the table for our server. Our server was ok, but we were both so uncomfortable at his point our visit was ruined. We contemplated speaking to a manager about the hostess but no manager ever came by our table. On our way out we did see the manager but he looked to busy hanging out with 2 of the female servers by the bar so we decided our complaint wouldn't make a difference if we interrupted him. We have been to this location several times & have always had great service but we will not return to his location.

So, we tried again. Same location, same poor service. The waitress would be gone for 10+ minutes, over and over again. We had to wait about 8 - 10 minutes to meet our waitress the first time, and then another 5+ minutes again to get our drink order placed. They showed up about 10 minutes later. Sigh. Someone brought our salads, and left quickly. I had to go find someone to get silverware and napkins. Shame, shame. Meals came much later, and once again food delivered with no question of 'did we need anything else'. Yes! We needed the missing items, and is it possible to get ketchup for our fries? Finally got everything. Finished eating without seeing waitress....again. She came by and asked if we wanted dessert. Kids ordered the pizookie trio and refills on drinks. Once again 10 - 15 minutes went by. Finally got pizookie, drinks and the check. By the time we got there and finished it was one hour and 45 minutes.

Today, my son had out patient surgery close by at 10:30am, and I knew by the time he was finished, it would be lunchtime and we'd all be hungry. I decided to try BJ's take out service ordering off my phone. Pretty easy and efficient, I must say.  When I arrived, I went right up to the take out area. Chris was the cashier. Although it was only 11:45am, he seemed overworked and bothered by customers. He was curt to the customer before me that asked a question, and then asked me 'what I needed'. No courtesy at all. As he rang up my pizza order, I mentioned that I used the online ordering system and that it was great, and also that I noticed it was free pizookie day tomorrow, June 14th, and asked if he could verify that? Nope, he said he didn't know anything about it. Then I mentioned that I had the most delicious pizookie ever about 2 months ago-the monkey bread pizookie, but noticed that it wasn't on the online menu-was it still available to order? He then said (which surprised me) ""I wouldn't know"".  What?!!! You wouldn't know? Chris, you work here!!! Part of your job is knowing what's on your menu, especially if you are the one positioned to answer the phone go take out orders.

We had an awesome experience tonight. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated but there was a guy giving out pizza while you waited. The hostess was very friendly and our waitress was great.

The gluten free Pizookie was also good.  My husband and daughter got their usual pasta and chicken and Barbacoa chicken with rice and black beans. We also had the calamari to start with.

It wasn't until another waiter, Wes, came by and gave us our refills and apologized. Wes was very nice, helpful, and apologetic about something that totally wasn't his fault.

Most servers are ok, but the food here takes a ridiculous amount of time to arrive after ordering. Since this is a pretty consistent thing, I blame this on poor management. About a year ago, we ordered curbside take out and it took them an extra 20 minutes past their quoted pick up time to bring it out despite us being there a few minutes early. Today, I had another terrible experience. As usual, it took a while for us to receive our food, but this was expected. A few bites into my first cup of endless soup, our waiter asks how everything is and I ask for a second bowl of soup. About 15 minutes later, the waiter checks on us again and I ask him to confirm that my soup is still on the way. He comes back a few minutes later saying that they ran out of tortilla soup and had to make a new batch, which was the reason for the delay. I figure one of two things happened: 1) he forgot to put in the order for my 2nd soup and made up an excuse that makes him look like the good guy or 2) the kitchen management is terrible because they both ran out of soup and didn't inform their wait staff that there would be a delay. Additionally, it took another 15 plus minutes after asking for the check despite me having my credit card ready to hand over once he brought the bill.

BOI were we wrong! To explain this experience I should probably begin with my girlfriend and my friends girlfriend. We all met during the war. No one knows how bad the war really was. Our females were fighting the enemy and got their hair-dos severely injured. My male friend and I were nurses so we met them when they came in for treatment. Luckily, we healed their hair-dos and kindled our relationships there. Now how this all ties in to our experience is, there was no hair in our meal. We appreciated that greatly. Unfortunately that was all we were able to appreciate. The waitress couldn't even spell her own name, she insulted my girlfriend by not knowing how to spell, the ravioli didn't taste like Chef Boyardee, they let some putrid infant cry near our table, and they maintained a rude tone throughout the night. Saying all this, I was delighted that my friend turned out to work here. He's a cool guy. So 10/10 experience. All thanks to him. Wish he was our waiter.

We sat at a booth in the bar area. Our waiter, Diego, was very nice and friendly. I wish he had informed me on all their different iced teas before I just ordered a regular one, though. We ended up splitting a BJs Supreme small deep dish pizza with added Italian sausage topping. The pizza was delicious. I especially love their pizza dough and crust here.

422,Michelle Z.,"Irvine, CA",94,3,1.0,1.0,2016-09-29,"This review is for customer service. I'll preamble this by saying: I don't really require a whole lot from my wait staff. Usually just that they get our orders right. Even when they get them wrong, I don't make a big deal about it, as long as they own up to the mistake and fix it. Tonight, friends and I went to BJ's for dessert and drinks. There were 9 of us total. It was around 8:30 or 9 pm when we came in and were seated within 5 minutes. Being a Wednesday night, it was relatively quiet. The evening was off to a good start. Our waitress tonight got our waters right away. About 10 or 15 minutes later brought out our drinks, and then another 5 minutes later our desserts came out. One of my friends didn't get her monkey bread. We mentioned it to another waiter passing us by and then the waitress came along a short while later and said she would bring it right out. It came up basically when everyone was ready to pay their bills.  The waitress asked us if we were paying separately or together. We said separately, and I mentioned I was going to be paying for the birthday girl as well. She seemed fine with that and brought out all our checks. I found a book that had two checks but my order was split into both checks. One check had my monkey bread listed and the other one had my drink, another drink, and another dessert that I assumed belonged to my birthday friend. This was my mistake for assuming because it turned out the birthday girl had only ordered a drink.  I gave the waitress my card paid the check.  A while later she came back with our receipts. One of my friends didn't find her check was trying to be honest and let the waitress know that she forgot to charge us for her dessert. The waitress said she was wrong and at that point, we realized it was accidentally on my check. My friend asked if she could reimburse me and charge her instead. The waitress said no and that it really wasn't that much money anyway. It's true. It was only a 5 dollar dessert and I had already told my friend it was totally fine but I feel like she could have resolved the issue but instead chose not to. Then, before leaving the table the waitress said, ""So no one is going to claim this monkey bread? Fine. I guess I'll just throw away the receipt since I brought one of them late."" She was kind of giving my friend who got her dessert late a look. Which made my friend uncomfortable because she was in fact being charged for her monkey bread and had her card already swiped. I had a receipt for monkey bread (the first check) in my check book so I assumed she had already charged me for mine as well. So we were both confused because we were the only two people who ordered that and as far as we knew, my friend was being charged for an extremely late dessert. And I was being charged for another person's dessert, on top of the two orders I was already paying for. I honestly shrugged off the comment and didn't give it another thought but my friend was uncomfortable by the fact that the waitress made a comment that implied one of us was trying to skip out on our monkey bread payment and then acted like she was doing us a huge favor by throwing out the check. So she wanted to clarify that she was in fact paying the late monkey bread. I thought she had a valid reason for being upset. At this point the manager stepped in and said he was going to investigate the situation further. He came back and said no you guys didn't pay for the late monkey bread. My friend showed him the receipt and said, I just paid for it. He then proceeded to say something along the lines of, ""well that's your fault. You shouldn't have offered her your card"". Then she explained, ""well, she only offered not to charge us for the monkey bread after she charged us. He got really defensive and was basically implying we were lying to him. Then he went to talk to his waitress and then came back and told my friend she didn't get charged for her monkey bread.  I then decided to double check my receipt and realized the I didn't have the receipt for the monkey bread that was included in the checkbook I was originally handed. The waitress must have not realized my card was supposed to go to both checks in the book. At this point, I realized what happened and tried to intervene and explained the situation to the manager. He, however, VERY RUDELY stopped me in my tracks and said, ""This conversation doesn't concern you. It's between her and I."" And then continued to speak to her in this rude tone. He escalated this situation and further agitated us when his job should have been to step in and do the opposite. I understand it was a confusing situation but being in the position he is in, he had an opportunity to turn this into something positive but instead made this a very negative experience. In the end, I forced in my explanation and he threw away the check. But made us waste 20 minutes and caused several members of our party to get upset over his attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=140,2.88,2.65,2.62,2.084,2.742

They are pretty consistent at all of their locations and I really like that. You always know that you're going to get a good meal.  The highlight of course to any trip to BJs is their pizookies.

139,Julie G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,14,19.0,4.0,2016-10-20,"I would like to say that I come the Laguna Hills location very often at least 3-4 times a month... this time my sever had such a bad attitude since the moment she asked what we would like to drink. I politely asked for waters all around and she rudely responded, how many... let me remind you there are four menus on the table in a four person table... but I proceeded to answer her by telling her four. She just vibed out bad attitude throughout the night... I tried to brush it off until I no longer could.  I know being a server can be challenging at times, but that should be no excuse for a lowsy service. I could've easily spent $10 on a meal at the in n out nearby, but why didn't I? Because I wanted to have a good time, with good company and good food. But our sever ruined that exerpience for my whole party. Furthermore, we had to keep asking for our drinks to be re-filled and ask for dipping sauces for the food we had ordered. It bothered me when she asked if we would like a box when I had a friend still in the middle of eating his pizza... how rude can that get? Might as well have given me the check the moment I placed the order... when she dropped off the box she also dropped off the check... when she dropped off the check I had asked her that I would like to pay via app and that the account wasn't linked... she demanded to see my personal phone because she said it was linked... when I had already given her my account number... I have no right to even show her my phone it is my personal property. She stood there with her negative attitude and impatiently waited for me, so I can pull up the information that I had just given her... after I showed her ""proof"" of my account she finally went back to link my account correctly this time... before she left I tried to get attention by saying excuse me because, I wanted to add the coupon but she just ignored me.  Let me remind you it was past 10pm on a Wednesday night, it wasn't ram packed busy... At that point I didn't even feel comfortable talking to her about a coupon I wanted to add that I had received via email... so I walked to the front of the house to pay my check. How stupid is that? For a customer to feel uncomfortable to talk to their server? It's not right for me to go through an experience like that. I spoke to the manager at the time and he gave me such a bs excuse that she's ""new"" I'm sorry but if she already has that type of attitude and she's ""new"" it says a lot about the type of standards they are holding here at this location. That should NEVER be an excuse. This was by far the worst experience I've had, I'm very disappointed in the server we had and the ""supervisor"" or manager at the time that helped with my dilemma. He wasn't rude, but his excuse for her was unacceptable.  It only takes one time to ruin it all. And that's exactly what this server did. I will not be coming back to this location. If you are reading this don't bother spending your time or moment here. You receive better customer service at a fast food joint called in n out. Their [in n out] employe standards are apparently a lot higher than this specific location. Should've just gone there but, ohh well too late now... so I'm warning you just to all together avoid this location.  And the cherry on top the food was lukewarm...  Location: Laguna Hills  Date of visit: 10/12/16 (approx 10-10:30pm) Server: Samantha T. *** Update ***  I came back and re-visited this location. Considering the fact that is a good place to watch games. I came back with my boyfriend and some friends who wanted to have a drink and watch the game. I was a little hesitant to do so BUT I'm glad I came back. Tonight we were served by a gentleman named Cameron! He was by far one of the best serves I've ever had here. He was polite, attentive and most of all FRIENDLY. Just because of him I'll definitely be coming back. Keep up the good work Cameron! He was super kind considering the fact that my steak was cooked rare, when I ordered it medium-rare. Without hesitation he got it fixed right away! I loved how he communicated to us about everything; from the appetizers, to deserts he reassured us our orders were placed and on the way. He kept asking how we were doing and refilled our drinks without us ever asking. What more can one possibly ask for?! You [Camen] proved me wrong about this place!

Our server, Mark was awesome. Very polite & professional, but didn't just stand there and read from their little script. He legitimately made an effort to make a bond with us and inquired about our day, etc. It was a nice touch and we both appreciated it very much.  Our appetizer (mozzarella sticks) came up incredibly fast & tasted amazing. Mark took the time to explain our menu options and made sure we both got exactly what we were looking for.  My wife & I ended up going with the ""2 for $25"" deal. That deal consisted of two soups or salads, a medium pizza (to share) and a pizookie. In our opinion, a TON of food! It was definitely more than enough to fill us both up! I went with soup for my first course; choosing the Broccoli Cheddar Soup. It was awesome! My wife chose the BLT salad and loved it! We shared the Meat Lovers Pizza and it was incredible.  As our time in the restaurant went on, the flawless service did not stop. Our food came up very, very quickly and exactly to order. Mark made sure that we had everything we needed and insured that our drink glasses were never empty. We both appreciated that he checked on us continually while we are, but not to the point where it became annoying and he made sure to never interrupt our conversation.  Once we finished up, we asked for boxes so we could take our amazing leftovers home with us. Instead of just setting boxes on the table, Mark took the time to box up everything for us.

And the cookies tasted old, almost having that stale flavor. How do you mess up the two things that your most known for? They did.

Ryanne, our waitress at first said she wasn't sure if they could do separate checks for our party of about 20 people, but when I told her we really needed that, she quickly said she would find a way to make it happen. It was a Saturday dinner crowd, so the patio quickly filled up with other diners and large parties, but Ryanne remained our server through the entire evening and took great care of us.  She was attentive, got everyone's order right and despite a bit of a wait, the food came out nice and hot. Everyone was really happy with the quality, taste and size of the portions. The prime rib was excellent, as well as the stuffed mushroom appetizers, the egg roll appetizers and the spinach dip. I heard someone raving about the ribs, too.  I could not have asked for better service. Ryanne was on top of all our requests and was super fast in getting us anything we needed.

She said to our family, ""You should've known better than that"" and continued to belittle and scold us for inquiring about it. Normally it takes a lot for me to feel offended by anything, as I am a pretty friendly and reasonably understanding person, but I have to admit, it was some of the worst treatment my family and I had ever received from another human being in general. We had given them our business and then treated like dirt in return. Honestly, it wasn't going to bother me either way whether we were able to receive the discount or not. I would have been just as happy to receive a normal response as simple as, unfortunately we are not able to honor that discount. It's a shame that they feel like they no longer need to be friendly to their customers anymore and at the minimum, treat them with simple human decency. No appreciation for what they have.

Management is definitely working this poor guy(Ryan I assume from our check) to the bone.

However, it ended up taking 40minutes. All of this waiting while my two year old is complaining how hungry he is. Not fun. Supposedly what was taking so long was the baked potato. I'm really not sure why that would be the thing that would delay the order by an additional 15-20 minutes. When we finally got the food home there were no utensils included and no wet wipes included (these are generally included whenever ribs are ordered). It was just a sour experience regarding take out. It's set up to be super convenient and easy. Call the restaurant, place the order, drive to the restaurant, call the number on the sign at your parking spot, and have your food brought to you.

1,R M.,"El Toro, CA",0,8,2.0,3.0,2017-08-19,I have always liked BJs but I think the food quality has gone down in the years. Tonight I ordered a salad forgetting to say dressing on the side. BIG MISTAKE. It was like soup. Does anyone like their salad drowning in dressing? It's hard to really judge the taste since it was overwhelmed by sweet honey mustard dressing. Half of it was inedible. I was offered something more lettuce (but it couldn't be fixed) or something else from the kitchen. The servers (bartenders since I sat in the bar) are great. I just ordered a Pizookie- I guess since I couldn't eat my dinner I saved room for dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=20,3.04,2.81,2.676,2.284,2.902

They gotten better. Servers carry a new app phone to take orders. Beers and food have arriver sooner! Easy and quick to ask for your bill! Oh and they have a new app! A must download because there's a lot of great deals! One time we got a steak, buy one get one free entree! And free pizzokies!!!! Tuesday is for the sweet lovers. 3 bucks pizzokies all day!!!

I placed a togo order tonight hoping I could skip the service and even though they use these fancy stickers with my name and entree and special instructions printed right there - still was incorrect.

6,Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",482,248,621.0,3.0,2017-08-25,"Not a fan of the massive corporate feel! I had my first BJs pizza on my 16th birthday at the Santa Ana location (no longer there). That was 37 years ago.. eeek. I was a huge fan then and BJs was what I compared all pizza to for many years. It's still good, but their menu has expanded exponentially losing focus on what mattered. The beer on the other hand is as important as the pizza of course! They've done a pretty good job on their Jeremiah Red, but that's about as dark as they go. I'm more of a porter fan. I wish they would make a porter instead of following this weeks IPA trend. LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 3.5) The location is huge and well done, although there is nowhere for the throngs of people waiting to be seated to hang out comfortably. The bar area is seated like normal tables so don't expect seating there either. Usually, the wait is not long though because it's a huge establishment. SERVICE (Rating 2) It's not often we get good service here. They are just too big and too busy. I constantly have to flag waiters down as they scurry by helping the other thousand people there. PIZZA (Rating 3.5) I usually get the ""Sweet Pig"". It's great and I like the thick crust. While their pizzas are called ""Chicago style"", they're not. I've been there and enjoyed what ""Chicago Style"" really is and they missed it. But that doesn't matter because BJs was one of the first on the west coast to introduce their own style based on an interpretation of Chicago Style and they did a great job. I just wish they were more consistent these days. Sometimes they are a bit undercooked, sometimes a bit soupy and others just right. They are overwhelmed with business and with a menu almost the size of Cheesecake factory, staying focused is pratcially impossible IMO. PiZZOKIE (Rating 5.5) It's not often I'll give more than 5 stars, but it's my rating system and I'll do what I want! This thing is bliss! I order the ""Black and White"". It's a combo (half and half) of their ""chocolate chunk"" and their ""white chocolate macadamia nut"" WAY TO GOOD!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=20,3.16,2.85,2.672,2.1559999999999997,2.974

Last time I went they gave me a meat burger instead of a Veggie Burger after we went over everything at least 4 times and when I picked it up they assured me all was right. I got home took a bite, luckily it was just the bun, saw the meat burger and immediately called them up. My husband got to eat but my burger was wrong and I had to take it back and my grilled cheese would be cold by the time I would get back. So the manager said she would have it all remade. Except my husband's of course. So I went back got the food. All that took 90 minutes to from the time I got there till the time I got to eat. The manager gave me some kind of card toward another meal.  Give us another chance she said. I said Oh I will. Today is the second time I have ordered and they got the order wrong. We went over the veggie burger part 4 times before. No Mayonnaise. I wanted Thousand Island. They assured me 4 times before and two times when I went to pick the order up.   I got home. I had Mayonnaise, No Thousand Island. I called. I refuse to go and get it the food right again. They said someone could take it to our house. I started to give the guy my address and then I gave up!!!! I am done with this company. This is so uncalled for.  The Take Out Service Stinks!!!!

146,Faye U.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,164,,1.0,2017-10-07,"We used to come here alot.  It was cool back when Christopher was waiter, then bartender.  After he moved on, the hh bartender was a short lady long straight blonde hair in a ponytail and she, like Chris, took pride in her work no matter how busy it got. Last time we went, we sat at the bar as usual and the service was lousy.  Bartenders were clumsy, spilling and dropping stuff on us and not even apologizing.  Nobody ever bothered to clear away my empty plate.  I complained to one of my dining companions and he chalked it up to them being millenials.  Whatever.  IIRC, Chris was also a millenial, and he was pleasant, courteous and gave a damn.  It's not the fault of when the staff were born, that's all on poor management's lack of training and oversight. This place has gone to the dogs, literally - someone who wasn't even blind took their dog INSIDE of there...yuck!  That's a Health Dept. violation.  One of my dining companions said it was for anxiety, but isn't that what meds are for?!  C'mon, who're they kidding...they don't have agoraphobia, they just wanna show off Fido everywhere.  LEAVE YOUR DAMN DOG AT HOME!  Gift card policies have changed for the worse.  This was never a problem when Chris and the short blondie tended bar.  Now, they try to automatically deduct a 20% gratuity from the card, so there's less credit from the actual order.  First off, these clowns did not merit a 20% tip at all.  2nd, the manager escorted my man out when he told her how upset he was about this.  This led him to believe he'd been comped for his troubles, but NO.   Once we were home, I fell asleep early, but was woken by incessant ringing and knocking on the door.  It was the OC Sheriff collecting on my man's bill.  WTF, why didn't the manager collect it at the restaurant instead of treating him like a dine and dash!  How humiliating and it interrupted my sleep not too long after I fell asleep.  Of course the popo had his info from the gift card.  He gave cash to the cops and will have to check the balance on that card in case BJ's double-dipped.   BJs:  Blow this!    Even before all this, I noticed too much price inflation for the quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=40,2.56,2.66,2.62,2.436,2.62

142,Rebecca C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2017-11-11,Bjs as an establishment is overall fairly good but this particular location does not represent the name well. Our experience started with a wait time quoted for fifteen minutes. We ended up waiting 50 and watched numerous parties who arrived after us go in. When asking the host when we would be seated we were told we were the next party and then watched at least six more parties go in front of us. After being seated we waited 10 minutes to be greeted. The food was average but the wait time and poor service took away from it. Would not recommend. There are better establishments nearby that have tastier food and better staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=40,2.32,2.77,2.68,,2.59
140,Tara P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,9,1.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"After multiple bad experiences this will be my last visit here. The last 3 times my food has been luke warm at best. The service is unbelievably slow EVERY time. Waited 30 minutes for my entree today, it was cold when it came out, had to wait another 20 minutes for a replacement, which I was charged for. Ordered pizookie--not cooked AT ALL in the middle. Like completely cold batter straight from the fridge. For how the food is priced, you think it would be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=40,2.24,2.77,2.684,,2.5580000000000007
32,Davina B.,"Santa Ana, CA",411,84,33.0,3.0,2017-11-18,"I gave 3 stars bc the food was good, but poor service by Simona, Sat afternoon.  1) I waited a very long time until she finally came to my table after I asked another employee in the bar area, who my server was. I actually got my own menu since it was taking so long.  2) I wasn't given silverware until AFTER my food was served. 3) My water glass was empty for a while. She said she'd come back with some, and never did. After quite some time another server refilled my water glass. 4) After I finished my meal, I moved it to the 2 top beside me with a napkin on top of my plate, waiting for my server to drop the check. Once again, waiting for awhile until she came by, maybe 10 min, I asked her for it. She was extremely slow and/or unaware of her lack of being proactive, serving...her job...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills,2.24,2.75,2.676,,2.5460000000000003
151,Brianne T.,"San Diego, CA",26,57,116.0,4.0,2017-11-28,"Twice coming to this business location. Twice I've had good service and good food. They were lightning fast to get the kid's food to us. They prolly know what's up with kids, hunger, and lack of patience. Our son loved their garlic knots, and their crispy chicken tenders were so crunchy yet so soft and easy to eat. WOW! Fries were good too. I had their shrimp and penne with red sauce. That is soooo good. Would have liked more vegetables and shrimp, though. Hubby ordered the full rack of ribs. ....and ate the entire plate. He's not a big guy just has a big appetite. A huge compliment to the kitchen for appealing to his tastebuds. He was a happy man leaving the restaurant. I did notice that the only friendly people in Irvine are the servers (hosts, too! anyone in the service element). Everyone else are stuck-up entitled little snobs. I won't be going to this restaurant often due to the city's community, but know that this is a FRIENDLY place, and you will find a SMILE at BJ's when you need to come in from the icy, inconsiderate hell of Irvine.

7,D. C.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,2.0,2017-12-17,"I ordered ahead online for pick up.  It took me 30 minutes to get to the restaurant and ended up waiting another 15 minutes for my order.  When I got home, the food looked like it was cooked and prepared for pick up in 10 minutes.  Half of my pizza had most of the pepperoni slices on them with some of the slices not separated.  Can you picture this...  1 slice of pizza had stacks of pepperoni, some of which was not separated.  The rest of the pizza had portions with little to no ingredients.  The restaurant was busy but that does not excuse them from cutting corners by ignoring quality over quantity.  I am giving an extra star simply because the host at the counter was very attentive to the needs of the customers including me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills?start=20,2.48,2.79,2.68,,2.6660000000000004
28,Luna C.,"Irvine, CA",26,31,53.0,2.0,2017-12-21,"Summary: while the decor and place was clean and beautiful, the wait, service, and food was not up to par.  It was about 10pm on Tuesday night when me and my friends arrived to BJs. There was about 30 people eating inside at the time when we came. When we all sat down and made up our minds on what we were going to eat, the waiter was no where to be found for about ten minutes. Once our order was placed it took 25 minutes to come out. I ordered the hottest chicken wings and when I took a bite I could not detect a hint of heat, not even exaggerating. I had a feeling this would be the case so I asked the waiter before hand to bring extra hot sauce for the chicken wings. The skin of the chicken was soggy and after I finished the whole plate, it left me and my stomach with a gross feeling. The waiter never checked up on us once and the check came 20 minutes after we were all done eating. We ended up staying at BJs for 2 hours, not because we were slow eaters but because of the slow service. Thank you but no thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-hills,2.52,2.77,2.684,,2.67
22,Aron N.,"Honolulu, HI",36,247,528.0,3.0,2017-12-24,"BJ's is one of those places that seems like they might brew beer but in reality they don't. Or at least they didn't the last time I asked. They have a nice selection of draft beers and truth be told - the food is decent if not good, but it's the kind of the place the more you drink the better the food tastes. Finally when you have drank enough - the food is pretty killer at that moment! hahaha! Well, it's your typical, good drinks, decent food, good service kind of place.

Their take out is a perfect option for those nights when you don't want to cook at home.
