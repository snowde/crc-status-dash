467,Rosalind C.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,137,60.0,3.0,2012-01-06,"I had dinner at this location with a friend during my vegas Holiday trip. Since there's not too many in AZ whenever I can visit one in another state I jump at the chance. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty crowded so we decided to eat at the booths in the bar area so we wouldn't have to wait. Our server was very attentive and was a good sport to put up with my friend's crazy sense of humor. I decided to start with the pomegranate margarita and ordered their Cajun pasta with shrimp as my meal. I like BJ's for the reasons why I like the Cheesecake Factory; tons of options and they're always consistently delicious. My pasta was huge,  I ate a large serving and still had lots to take with me for leftovers. For dessert my friend and I shared the baked beignet that was warm delicious and the perfect ending to my meal :-). This place is pretty solid so I may think about driving out of my way to visit one here in AZ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=460,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0840000000000005,3.0000000000000004

390,Bridgette Q.,"Spring, TX",16,54,10.0,4.0,2012-02-10,"[Visited on Wednesday Feb 8th] I'm not big on chain places but our food was pretty good. I had chicken wontons with thai sauce and spinach stuffed mushrooms. My hubby had an ""under 575 calories"" meal that was very good. Lots of textures and flavors and moist chicken breast to satisfy the gastronome whose counting calories. But I ordered the small bites so that I could save room for one of those famous deliciously decadent pizookies. If you don't know what it is, I'm going to leave you guessing. Get curious and try it out - you won't be disappointed. The place gets a four on dessert alone. Did I mention that they MAKE delectable sodas - root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and at least one other? We rarely order non-alcoholic drinks cuz we're stingy when it comes to what we spend our dining money on - but this was well worth it plus we got free refills. We also ordered a happy hour drink, mango mojito, which was like $5. During happy hour, they also have $2 off full-size appetizers and 1/2 price mini-pizzas (which really aren't that small; they're deep dish). It was a good deal. We spent more than we usually do because we ordered drinks and dessert but it was still a good deal. We'll definitely go back if only to sit in the bar and watch sports on one of the tvs. Also, we didn't have to wait at all for a table like Matt C. apparently had to. It was about 4pm on a Wednesday, so I guess it was a good time to dine. I'm sorry Matt C. didn't enjoy his experience, but we really liked it. I'd say try it out for yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=380,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.248,3.1200000000000006

I've always liked BJ's for their food, but I will admit that I usually go for their high calorie salads, soup and beer... The Ahi Tuna Salad is delightful and the main thing I get here.

472,Jeff K.,"Renton, WA",0,24,,4.0,2012-05-06,"I read some of the reviews that mentioned slow and not so good service, long waits for food n drinks, etc,,,,I had a good experience last night about 6pm,,,(it was helpful I arrived well before 6pm and the dinner rush),,,i was able to get my name (party of four) on the seating list quickly and it was within minutes I was called n seated, our server and the expediters seemed fairly prompt and organized and the foods n drinks seemed timed appropriately.  The food quality was very good (one tilapia dish and one top sirloin dish) but the pizza was needing some work, I wouldn't order the pizza as it didn't appear to be their strong suit (such as throwing a few pieces of pepperoni on a pepperoni pizza order).  It was interesting that their menu offers just about everything, but they practically only have one type of dessert called 'pazookie' which is really good if you love semi cooked cookie dough w/ ice cream on top, be advised the pazookie pan is hot out of their 350 degree oven and is scalding hot, yeah I learned the hard way, I have never been to BJs before and the expediter server didn't say anything to me when she placed it on the table.  Our server seemed nice enough, good attitude and pleasant enough and he was efficient w/ just about everything, only forgetting one drink which was promptly served when reminded,,good job to him.  (I really wanted some cheesecake for dessert after a steak dinner,,,I hope that BJs will add that to their menu).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=460,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.248,3.2400000000000007

They tried to sit us in a booth where only 4 Adults sit. We were a party of 6 with one child. A Manager came out and saw how cramped we were and moved us. Other then that overall experience could have definately been better. I had Tortillia Soup- which had a very thick consistency. Flavor was just ok.

Plenty of service and smiling faces, but you know that its not going to be that good when you ask the hostess "" What is good to eat?"" and they have no response. Menu was way to big. Took 10-15 minutes to get a couple of beers. The beer was good and cold, but I think I would rather have a Draft House beer. Had a side salad that was swimming in water and dressing took a few bites and put it at the end of the table. Shared the sliders. Over cooked meat on a bun that was was to big , no onions or pickles, just bread and meat. Also had a pizza, not a lot of cheese or sauce so it was really dry. We decided to use the rest of the gift card on a couple of beers, wasn't going to try anymore food, it took another 15 minutes to get a couple of beers that we had to down quickly to make our movie on time.

I usually try to cut the server lots of slack, especially when serving large groups, but this was ridiculous.  We had a two year old so we just stopped by a coworker's retirement celebration for a short period of time. But when my son got squirmy and we tried to sneak out early, we had to wait 40 to 50 minutes for our check.  The food was slow, it took forever to get things like a spoon for my son's applesauce, and the waitress made lots of errors on the bills and credit card charging (they wound up just making us wait until everyone was ready to go and giving us our check last. So much for slipping out early).

I started tonight's experience by sampling 2 beers and deciding on the hefferveisen it was very good and I asked for an orange to complement the flavor.

First, the service here is always bad.  We always have to wait ages for drink refills and orders.  And, literally, every single time we've received something incorrect when the food arrives.  And I'm not talking about something small - I'm talking about an entirely different entree being presented than ordered. Second, the ""to go"" service is equally horrid.  The pickup times are never even close to being correct, i.e. told 20 minutes and waited 50.  Plus, the food tastes drastically different from when you eat in versus take home.

Their alcoholic drinks are all very tasty, but for those who aren't big on alcoholic drinks , give the root beer a try!  They make the root beer there and you'll definitely be requesting a refill.

460,Megan H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,,2.0,2012-10-04,I have had the worst luck here lately. It used to be one of my favorite places to go. I always order the sweet pig pizza and used to love it. The last 2 times I've eaten at BJs the dough tasted pre-cooked and reheated and the toppings weren't cooked and the cheese was minimal. We also got the chicken Marsala and it was flavorless and the pasta was stuck together and undercooked. I think I'm done with BJs.

The food is ok- they have a wide selection of things which is good, but unless you know what you are in the mood you could be searching for a while.  My favorite item (besides the Pazookies) is the Fresh Mozzerella and Tomato salad in the small bites section. I've had a mini deep dish pizza, and it was good, but I haven't had many deep dishes so I don't know how it adds up to a real Chicago Deep Dish.  The downside is that this location is ALWAYS packed. I know it is newer to the Centennial area, but geez, it seems that every night everyone and their mom goes there so you are left with waiting for a while.  Service has been great everytime I go. I haven't had a problem with them yet.  Pricewise it could be a bit expensive if you go all out. The best deal is to get the Pazookie Trio and try three different types of Pazookies for half the price of one big one. The Small Bites section is pretty cheap; they use to have an awesome Seared Ahi Tuna dish that was a great deal.

Once we got our entrees, we didn't get ketchup, had to actually get up and ask another table to take the one from their table. Also didn't see our server once we got our entrees for about 15 min after we had our food to stop and ask how it was. My burger was NOT cooked to medium. The server didn't add cheese to another burger. Had to ask to get a refill. Just all around bad food and bad service. And, our server only had three tables, so it's not like she was swamped.

We were told by the management that the pizza comes with nothing but bread and cheese and what ever topping you pick. Well that's not pizza if you ask me. (That's called a sandwich.)

317,Julie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,80,137.0,2.0,2013-06-01,"I want to start by saying that I think this restaurant is really overrated. I have been here numerous times and only twice have I not experience a problem with either our order or the service.  It's usually something simple like when my husband orders no mayo on his burger and it comes with mayo. The annoying part is that it ALWAYS happens! How hard is it to not put mayo on a hamburger? Often times our drinks never get refilled and the servers here are often MIA. It may seem silly to complain about a soda refill, but it's the little things that make the experience when you go out.  The tables really turned for me when I was a BJ's for my friends daughters birthday party and we had the absolute worst service ever! She was turning 9 and she choose BJ's for her birthday lunch, which I personally think was quite grown up for a nine year old, she could have gone anywhere but she choose BJ's!! Anyway, we only had 11 people in our party and it was 3:00 pm so it wasn't anything too crazy and it wasn't a rush hour, so it shouldn't have been something that they couldn't have been able to handle. Our server wasn't off to a good start, he was just sweating profusely as if it were 100 degrees inside the building with no air! He actually had sweat pouring from his face! Clearly a partly of 11 was going to be too much for him to handle, he needed to ask for help. Of course he didn't get help and things just got worse and as luck would have we weren't his only table.  .........And that's when it happened! Our server had just cleared of a dirty table behind ours and was walking behind behind us with a tray full of half empty dirty glasses,  when he spilled the tray all over my son and I !!!!! We were both cover with what I think was old iced tea! As we sat there wet, cold and in shock, our server just said nonchalantly ""I am sorry"" and continued walking to the back. He never came back out! So my son and I were left to try to dry of with the napkins rolls that were on the table! Meanwhile the floor underneath our chairs was a pool of spilled liquid and we were surrounded by it, so if we were to try to move our chairs to get up we would have been stepping in liquid! About three minutes latter our server was still MIA and there was no one coming out to mop up the floor, I was beginning to think I was being Punked! I saw a women walking toward our table who looked like the manager and I thought oh good she is coming to fix the situation, but nope! She just walked right by our table, even after looking directly at the puddle on the floor!! Finally another person at out table had to stop the manager because I was trapped in my chair wet and surrounded by the puddle of spilled drinks!! Meanwhile, my poor son just sat there so quietly and didn't complain once! Finally the manager did come over to me, she asked what happened and I told her how our server spilled a tray of old drinks on my son and I and then disappeared and didn't offer us anything to dry ourselves off with, nor did anyone come to mop up the floor! The manager barley apologized and then all she gave us was a small stack of the brown paper towels from the bathroom to dry ourselves with. I would have expected a clean white towel from the back, but this lady seriously did not get it! Finally about 15 minutes into this disaster someone came to mop up the floor so we were able get out of our chairs to make it to the bathroom. So then our bill comes, and don't get me wrong, I am not after free stuff, but after you spill a tray of drinks on my son and I and then disappear and treat us like crap, it would have been nice to just have taken care of the bill. Nope! Not even a little I am sorry discount! They gave my bill in full! So why the two stars you may be asking? Because I went home that night night and told my hubby the whole awful story and he was pissed at me and asked why I didn't freak out on them?! I told him it was because I was at a birthday party and I was trying to keep it cool, could you imagine if I went all momzilla at my daughters friends birthday, she would have died!! So my hubby went to BJ's website and contacted them. He was latter called by the DM who apologized for the whole episode and sent us a $50 gift card. Again, I am not after free stuff, what I really wanted was for them to just OWN IT the day it happened! If you mess up then just apologize and mean it!! The DM also sent the mother of the birthday girl a gift card too because the server messed up the birthday cake.

We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated.  There was lots of tables, but very few waiters.  We ordered the BJ classic deep dish pizza, which would be $24. 00 if we did not have a coupon.  We waited 40 minutes to be served a deep dish pizza on a platter with raw vegetables.  The picture in the menu shows deep dish pizzas in a pan with lots of melted cheese and cooked vegetables.  We were so hungry that we started eating until we noticed no sauce on the pizza.  We spoke to a manager who stated they don't .put sauce on the pizza they have seasoned tomatoes. As far as the vegetables he agreed they needed to be cook more.  He took the pizza away and said they would remake it with sauce and cook vegeables.  We waited 45 minutes when they rushed out of the kitchen to tell us they had to remake the second pizza because it cracked in the oven.  We tasted the 3rd pizza, and there was no more sauce that the 1st pizza and the vegetables were still raw.  We gave up, and left the restaurant with the manager writing off our pizza.  We came home and I reheated my left over dinner from the nite before that I had made homemade.  My husband thinks B.J.'S is using frozen pizzas that they just add to what the customer had order.

242,Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",850,405,1336.0,4.0,2013-09-11,"Finally got around to going to this BJ's close to my neck of the woods.  Would always pass by it on Centennial and see it was near constantly busy with cars.  Whaddaya know, we like it! Nice building, very reminiscent of the one on Charleston (my guess is that's the point).  Lots of dark wood, intimate lighting in some parts, lots of room at the bar with multiple TV's.  Nice flooring and high ceilings too.  I like the rotating door at the front entrance, good touch.   The night we came it was on a weekend so it was busy at a nice clip.  We didn't have to wait long for a table though, maybe about 5 minutes.  Aisles are pretty spacious so I had no problem getting to my seat. Our server was courteous and well-mannered, took care of us really well.  Even if we weren't first-timers to BJ's he still gave us a nice review of the menu and the specialty types of pizzas they create.  Informative, nice. We've been to BJ's before so we had a good idea of what we were ordering.  There were four of us in our party and we got: *Piranha Pale Ale Nachos - Topped with BJ's Pale Ale Chili, jack and cheddar cheese, tomatoes, green onions, olives, cilantro, and sour cream.  With a side of fire-roasted salsa and extra jalapenos. *BJ's Favorite Signature Deep Dish Pizza (Large 14"") - Meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, onion, and tomatoes. *Baby Back Pork Ribs - Flavored with Big Poppa Smokers' Sweet Money Championship Rub, topped with BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale BBQ sauce, and served with two steak sides of your choice (we opted for steamed veggies and the Wedge Salad). Luckily on this day we had a coupon from Facebook where you buy an entree and get another entree of equal or lesser value FREE.  We bought the pizza and got the ribs gratis!  Not a bad deal at all.  Especially considering a large pizza will set you back between $20 - $25 depending on what kind of pizza you order. The food?  Not bad!  Definitely reminds you of a Cheesecake Factory type joint.  The nachos were good, lots of cheese everywhere, and that fire-roasted salsa had some great flavor.  The pizza was good, definitely fits up to being a signature of BJ's.  The crust was thick but still light and airy.  Nice crunch on the outside with a good chew on the inside.  Loaded with good toppings.  After two slices I was done!  Definitely not a NY pie (which I kinda prefer).  The wedge salad was excellent, and would only be that way IF you have a head of very, very fresh Iceberg lettuce.  Topped with creamy bleu cheese dressing, bacon bits, and fresh black pepper, it was a good accompaniment.  The surprise of the night was the pork ribs!  Someone did it right - enough smoke, generous rub, enough sauce (with extra on the side), cooked just right to near-fall-off-the-bone, I couldn't get enough!  I finished half the rack myself.   With that coupon our meal was a near steal.  For the four of us, we managed to get away with an under $50 check (with tax & tip), and leftovers for a midnight snack.  I like a value meal! We were too full, but one should try and get a BJ's Famous Pizookie.  A warm deep dish cookie, topped with two scoops of cool, creamy ice cream?  Yeah you're gonna want one.

369,Thanh N.,"沖縄県, Japan",172,314,87.0,1.0,2013-09-17,"CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW: I came here with my husband and two other couples for a Friday date night. Our server was horrible and so rude! My friend comes here at least twice a month and has been for over a year. She always orders the margharita pizza which comes with basil and tomatoes. This time when her pizza came out, it only had basil. She politely let the server know that it was missing tomatoes and asked for tomatoes. The server rudely told her that the pizza never came with tomatoes and she got exactly what she ordered(even though it always had tomatoes every other time she ordered it). He was about to walk away but she asked that they please out tomatoes on for her. A manager then came over and said 'hmm so I heard your pizza didn't come with tomatoes and it should have. We're going to comp that dish for you, sorry for the mistake'. Ok cool, but then when the new pizza came out the rude server AGAIN had to voice his opinions that the pizza does not come with tomatoes and that she was wrong and he is right(EVEN THOUGH THE MANAGER APOLOGIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED  IT SHOULD HAVE TOMATOES!)And next time she needs to order another pizza called something else that comes with tomatoes and sausages, and had to say 'YOU ARE WRONG'. wow! Seriously? That's extremely unprofessional! And RUDE! Second problem-everyone ordered appetizers and when they came out one was missing. We ordered two artichoke appetizers and only one came out. By the time everyone was finished with their appetizers the second artichoke plate still had not come out. We flagged down our waiter to ask him to cancel the order as our entrees had just arrived. He would NOT cancel it and said 'oh I didn't know you wanted it to come out before your entree'. Uh hello? It's called an appetizer not a side dish!.....anyways he would not cancel the order and then magically brought out artichokes five minutes later.  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where a waiter is allowed to openly be rude and tell a customer they are wrong despite such a minor request! My friend was not at any point rude with her request at all and quite polite too. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. I wish I had remembered his name, but I didn't pay. if I ever see him again(not on a group date), I will be sure to make a formal complaint with a manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=360,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.5640000000000005,3.5200000000000005

335,Tim N.,"Las Vegas, NV",181,22,5.0,3.0,2013-11-27,"Had the opportunity to visit this location, my first ever to a BJ's, on a Wednesday afternoon.  We had a short wait for a table and when we were walked to the table by a friendly hostess, I was surprised to see a tray of dirty glasses sitting on the booth bench seat.  It was quickly cleared away, but was still tacky to start things off. Our server was very mechanical and could have been a lot more attentive.  I sat with an empty glass for over 20 minutes after she stated she'd be ""right back"" with my refill.  We were her only table, so I know her attention wasn't focused on her guests at that point. The food was definitely better than what I expected and I enjoyed my Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich a great deal.  The wedge-cut fries left a LOT to be desired, however.  They were barely warm and lacked any sort of seasoning whatsoever.   I'd give the restaurant another chance, but not for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=320,3.4,3.46,3.46,2.8920000000000003,3.4360000000000004

There was no offer to correct the problem or at least comp beverages. We never saw the manager, even just to check in about the issue.  Then the server just kept saying ""I really hope you'll come back"" in a way where she was almost waiting for us to say we would.  What I wonder is why would she expect us to come back to a place where we were dissatisfied, expressed that dissatisfaction and the only action taken is to tell the kitchen manager...  so it doesn't happen to someone else?  I don't typically go back to eat at places where the food was bad, especially if nothing was done to address it with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=420,3.32,3.43,3.43,2.6280000000000006,3.386
288,Kasio M.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",29,34,7.0,1.0,2013-11-29,"I was not aware that Orwellian 1984 double thinks were made into a concept restaurant. But they are and it is called BJ's! Everyone will tell you how great this place is until one day you walk into their shiny establishment in Centennial Hills. About 30 minutes later you will realize that all of your friends actually hate you for suggesting that you dine here. All the service people are nice but in a really vacant Stepford wife kind of way. It's all lip service and no actual service. For example, our server was super interested in up-selling fancy beer to me... so we had to have a really long discussion about why I should try another kind of beer as opposed to the one I wanted. Once ""we"" decided that I would stick to drinking what I want, we must have also decided that the table would wait for 20 minutes before said drinks would be delivered.  If you've ever read 1984 you will know that questions are also pretty unacceptable. I wish I had known that it was a 1984 concept restaurant before I asked about vegetarian options on the menu! I had planned on ordering some pasta or something, but it turns out that all the pastas and salads include meat and are priced accordingly. One question about that and she was off for another several minutes. And the fun didn't even end there! I ordered soup and salad as my entree and both the soup and the salad were delivered to the table at the same time several minutes before anyone else was served. But I guess they did not consider this a problem since there was no silverware. So it's not like I was going to eat it before the rest of my party's food arrived, anyway NO BIG DEAL GUYS! And so I stared at my food until the rest of the party got their food delivered, too. And still there was no silverware. The random hostess that delivered the food nicely asked if we needed anything else and when we asked for silverware, she walked away. Then we all got to stare at our food TOGETHER! When we finally did get some silverware, I ate my Denny's quality food while feeling angry about the empty service and impending bill. This place is really Applebee's quality with Cheesecake Factory prices. My throat almost closed when I saw that the $12 avocado roll appetizer was actually only THREE avocado spring rolls. Not that it mattered since we never got appetizer plates even though we were asked if we wanted some when the appetizer was delivered. (Here is a tip: probably you should just bring appetizer plates instead of asking if the table would like some and then never bringing them causing another ""lets all stare at this food"" situation.) Try eating a whole meal with an anger lump in your throat. It really takes the enjoyment out of eating. BJ's was a big fat $60 disappointment that ruined the pleasant experience that eating usually provides to me. That is a big deal considering that is why restaurants even exist. Note to the management: I think that I would have given this experience 3 stars had the server or staff, who KNEW that this was a messed up dining experience for a number of reasons, had even tried to rectify the situation or notified the manager that the meal had been timed and executed very badly. But no one wanted to fix it and that enrages me more than anything else. Vegetarian Side note: I didn't try the pizza even though it is supposedly really good for vegetarians, but be warned unless you want pizza, you probably won't find anything else on the menu that you want. All the pastas and salads include meat, and I don't see the point in paying $16 for a salad and then asking that they remove the most expensive ingredient. They have a veggie burger which is your standard garden burger replacement. And it was soggy.  I will never go back to BJ's. It is over-priced and overhyped. If anyone I know ever tells me how great this place is again I will drop kick them so hard that they will need a kidney transplant in their face.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=280,3.28,3.39,3.39,2.6920000000000006,3.346

Unlimited refills too. Even better!   I tried the Cobb salad from their lunch menu and it was the perfect portion. Not too big and my too small. I was able to finish it all and still feel comfortable. No stuffy feeling if you know what I mean.  Although this is a bar it's still a nice place to come to grab a bite to eat.

My wife and I arrived for lunch and the place was almost full. The hostess acknowledged us with a halfhearted greeting but sat us to our booth quickly.  When we got to our booth the floor underneath the booth was blatantly littered with food, bits of torn paper, crayons, used drink straws and so on, basically as if four young children had been seated there prior to us and the staff failed to sweep up after they left. 10 min later the waiter introduced himself and took our drink and appetizer order. The waiter (Chase) was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu.15 min later our drinks arrived and he took our lunch order. Another 20 mins later our appetizer arrived and the waiter noticed we needed refills. We had the bonless wings. They were ok nothing special. After another 20 min and our lunch arrived via a somewhat rudish food runner who did not acknowedge us and basically drop our plates in front of us and took off. I had the pulled pork sandwich with wedge cut seasoned fries and coleslaw. All of it looked great. Pork was moist and tender but no flavor. The fries once again had no taste. The coleslaw was delicious. I did not finish my meal due to lack of interest. The wife ordered the Jalapeno burger with the seasoned wedge fries and at first glance it looked great. But after further inspection the burger was way overcooked and the pepperjack cheese looked dead. She lost her appetite, but she is 9mths pregnant so that may be why. I never tasted her burger it just didnt look like something i would have liked. Her fries were no different than mine. Drink refills were few and far between.

Since moving to Vegas I haven't gone to BJ's much because there are so many other options when dining out. If you're a beer lover, this place is a must try because they are as much of a microbrewery, as they are a restaurant. Sometimes if they're promoting a certain beer, your server may even offer you a sample. Or if you're not sure what to get, opt for a flight of ""samples"". When it comes to food, BJ's is comparable to Yardhouse or other mid-range bar/grill type places. I typically go for a couple of their small plates, which are tapas sized appetizers, to start off and my favorite is the mini-bruschetta. On my most recent visit, I also tried the new corn fritters w/ bacon aioli and an order of their traditional wings, which are pieces of fried chicken with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch. The food is always fresh...the only issue I've had is that sometimes they deliver food to the wrong table because your server is never the person who brings out the food...not sure why that is because that is typically why each table is assigned a server isn't it?  The burgers, flatbreads, pizza, and appetizers here are all usually pretty tasty and sometimes I have no idea what I want to order. If you come Mon-Fri during lunch, there's a lunch specials menu you can order off of with pretty decent pricing...I think it starts at $6.95, but I've never tried it so I'm not sure what the portions are like. The staff here at this location are nice and continuously stop by to check on you. If you're seated in an area where the server is busy, another server will often stop by and introduce themselves and put in your drink order so that you're not just sitting around like an idiot. I like that. They also have a rewards program but sadly you don't get points/credit for alcohol/beer!  This BJ's is always packed when I'm here in the evenings and I can see why! The bar area is nice with both tables and barstools, and many large TVs, making it a good place to watch sports as well.

The service has always been good and there is definitely no issue there. I went to this location on Sunday with my parents and my mom and I both ordered the sirloin steak - medium. Ive ordered this plenty of times before and its always been good... not Outback good, but definitely decent. Yesterday's came out like it had been cremated. The char was so thick it couldn't be cut off. My steak was grey with no pink and charred. My moms was the charred on the outside and bleeding in the middle. I sent mine back and my mom thought she could salvage hers. The waiter was awesome, service was great. Manager came out and apologized and I told him that I wanted it just like the picture, no char. What did I get.... the same amount of char and a pink middle. Took one bite and there was no other taste than the char. Literally, all you could taste was the burnt meat. Sent it back again and the manager came out again. I was informed that two weeks ago all the steaks had changed and this is the way they are doing them now. Why I am writing this post... just to let others know about the change, since BJ's didn't feel the need to change its images on the menu and didn't mention it to us when we ordered. So, long story short, ordered the steak, sent it back twice. Decided to not even try and go with the Chicken Pot Stickers. They rocked. By the time I got my food, everyone at the table was of course finished with their meals. I was a little surprised that after all that, the manager didn't ever offer to comp anything. I don't mind paying for what we ate and its not an issue that we were charged, but I was just a bit surprised it wasn't even offered. I didn't ask, but left disappointed in the whole experience.

This is the second time we ate here and we loved it so much the first time, we needed to return when we came back into vegas.  I would have gave full stars this time but our waiter wasn't that great.  So, sat and he came up and was not interested in US, just wanted to see if we had a card with the restaurant and we said no and he left and didn't come back for a while.  Upon his return he stated that he needs to know if we wanted a frequent diner card and we said ""NO thank you"" because we don't live in vegas and he walked away again.  Now, someone else came back to do our drinks and then he came to take our order and didn't seem to want to help with our questions.  So, we just ordered what we knew and then he was on his way.  The food came and made up for the poor service.  We had shrimp scampi (if you like drier scampi like I do and lots of garlic with angel hair pasta...this was awesome) the husband kids had stuffed mushrooms, cheese sticks, chicken pasta and the grilled salmon.  All five of us devoured our meals and appetizers.  No room for desserts...had the pizookies the last time and they were fun but not good enough to make room for.  Will return to BJs centennial again and again.  We like the cleanliness of the place and the neighborhood is great.  We used to live in Vegas and loved this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=400,2.8,3.34,3.34,3.152,3.124

My grandma purchased gift cards for the holidays and it took a good 20 minutes for the transaction. Apparently the computer had a glitch. That's fine.  We were patient and understood that things happen. With the purchase of $100 you are suppose to receive 4 souvenir beer glasses and a 20% off VIP card. My grandma received the glasses but not the VIP card. So, I hop back in line and the cashiers at the to go section (where you purchase gift cards) were too flustered to even acknowledge their customers. After about 15 min someone finally acknowledges me. They did give me the 20% gift card but then proceeded to explain that it may not work properly because the VIP card was not rung up with a transaction. Know what am I suppose to do with that?! The manager gave me his card and said if I have issues to show his card. The only problem is that my grandma lives 30 min away and barely goes to this BJ's.  Now, on to the food. I ordered the Cajun pasta. It was ok. NOTHING like the Cajun pasta that Cheesecake Factory has. I also had the broccoli cheddar soup. Now, that was GOOD.

However, the service is ALWAYS terrible.  It must be a corporate issue. I visited many locations in various cities and only once have I ever had good service. This last visit at the Centennial location was no different. Being a Friday night, we expected it to be busy. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, but once we were seated it was 10 mins. or more before our server came over. No big deal, he was obviously busy with multiple tables and we took the time to decide on our food. When he came over, we ordered food and drinks. He brought the drinks out promptly, but that was it. We never got 1 refill the entire hour we were there. A little crazy to me since I'm paying $2-$3 for an iced tea and my husband and I had each drained our glasses before the food even came out.

This was my first time here and I had heard about the service prior to going but kept an open mind. I feel bad cause our poor waitress was either new or just having a really bad day! I was fine with how extremely slow the service was until I started seeing tables that came after us (group of 4) started getting their appetizers before we even got our salads. So I started to get increasingly annoyed by this point. After 45 min we finally asked where our salads were. Which came about 5 min after that. So 50 min just to get our salad. So then our food arrives about another 15-20 after that. Omg the pizza was terrible. It was so dried out that it didn't even look like they put cheese on it. 18 bucks for a dried out 8 inch pizza with pepperoni and olives. OUCH. 85 bucks for the 4 of us and 2 hours later we could finally leave! I don't think I will ever go back here. For some reason it seems to be a trendy place to go but the food and service suck.

Their new brussel sprouts with the sriracha sauce, it's okay. The sauce is delicious, however I would suggest blanching them first, and then put them on the grill for more tenderness. My husband had the portebello swiss burger. He said it was really good, less the balsalmic vinegar.  We will continue to come to BJ'S. I love how they are always adding new menu items.

267,Alyssa L.,"Woodbridge, VA",48,108,23.0,2.0,2015-07-26,"I've enjoyed eating here a handful of times and the food has always been good and service has been average. Today though everything was horrible. It wasn't necessarily the servers fault as it appeared she was spread a little thin, but when that busy standing around chit chatting with others didn't help.  It took sitting there 10 minutes at least before we could place a drink order and by then we had our orders ready to go as well. My husband's salad came quick enough and then 15 mins after ordering my toddler's pizza came. We were informed the plate was hot, so obviously I took to avoid my 2 yr old getting burned. Why put a child's pizza on a hot plate and then continue to bring it out still has me a little baffled, but I guess that's acceptable to them. It's about 20 minutes after placing our orders and we still don't have our drinks (we didn't order anything fancy, just a beer and ice tea) and eventually  I am able to get the servers attention to ask where they are. We actually ended up getting our food before the drinks. As for the food my husband's food had to me immediately returned as his pulled pork sandwich was so cold I thought for a second it must have been pulled from the refrigerator. My chicken Caesar salad was ok, but definitely nothing impressive. I could have saved myself 5 dollars and gotten one down the street at Rachel's. Waiting to pay ended up being a joke as well. My husband and son actually ended up getting up and going outside as I sat there for a good 15 minutes. I must have looked annoyed because the other server in the area actually giggled when she saw my face. It took the manager walking past me almost twice before he offered to take the check and ring it up.

The last 6 months though - after second chance, third chance etc. of hoping they'd get it together - I'm afraid we will never go back to this location. The service over the last 6 months is terrible...the waiters are moody, the orders aren't accurate and you have to ask repeatedly for anything. The food has been perfect the last 2 times but prior to that the food was inconsistent and not accurate according to the menu (ex. the tomato mozzarella salad comes with balsamic reduction, olive oil, purple onion, garlic and basil...sometimes the onion would be left off completely other times there would be tarragon on it instead of basil!). It's more aggravating to go there then to just cook at home and clean up myself. Dinner there recently has sometimes taken an hour and half because they're so slow. On a weekend night we used to wait about 45 mins for a table for 4 and now we maybe wait 5-10 mins if at all...I think that says it all. Everyone is seeing the dip in quality and the poor service and are choosing to go elsewhere. Even the managers sometimes seem frazzled with what they're dealing with. The bathrooms are rarely clean and the restaurant isn't as clean as it used to be (I slipped on a grape on our last visit AND stepped in a puddle of melting ice in a separate part of the restaurant).

232,Brian L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,80,7.0,1.0,2015-07-26,"Well, this place seemed to have gone downhill at a rapid pace. We come here occasionally since living here, and it is not what it use to be.  Today's experience alone was enough. We come in for Sunday lunch, and we wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostess apparently doesn't hand out silverware when they pass out the menus, so after we ordered our entire meal, all at once after our server was finally able to make it over, and I get a salad, I guess the expected me to show them how I eat at Medieval Times, because it took a few more minutes to get some. Then our kids pizza comes out, and the server warns us that the plate is extremely hot (from the heat lamps I am assuming). WHO THE F^€# is going to put a scolding hot plate in front of a toddler to eat off of. Maybe they should have just handed him a steak knife and some fireworks to go along with his meal. Then our meal comes out, and my pulled pork sandwich came out cold. Seriously?!?! So that was sent back, but right before that, our drinks from the bar that were ordered when we placed everything finally come in, and it was only a tap beer and a flavored iced tea. I watched a lot of the servers come and go from the bar pickup, and not a single server chose to help out our server by bringing out two drinks while they grabbed their table's drinks. Then the manager came out with a stone face and brought me my reheated sandwich and simply asked ""is that better?"". Didn't ask anything else or really talk at much.  I didn't even bother talking to the manager about this, since he left his bag of F^€#s at home. Despite all of this, our server was real nice and she was doing the best that she could, but it didn't help that none of the servers seemed to work with each other, and that is the manager's fault!!

121,Doug W.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,4,5.0,1.0,2015-08-29,"In the words of the late, great Arthur Ashe ""Trust has to be earned, and should come only after the passage of time"".  These words should be the foundation that I make my dining selections on when eating away from home. Selecting the BJ's location on Centennial in the Northwest part of Las Vegas should have never happened after the third or fourth time my family and I had a bad experience, but I kept believing that they could earn my trust.  My child, who loves the Pizookie however, makes that choice a bit more difficult. We have experienced more than a few 'let-downs' at this location, but the latest experience might be one of the worst.  The latest implosion occurred tonight. We are rewards card holders and used the app to check in so our wait time might be lessened, but when we arrived we were still waiting, which we understood as it was a particularly busy night.  After an hour of waiting in the restaurant we asked how much longer the wait was. The hostess advised they were cleaning our table right then. Fifteen minutes later, the same hostess approaches us and said that she ""forgot us"" and that she would seat is promptly. Great start, BJ's.  The hostess said she would have the manager come to us because of the situation, but of course that never happened. We had to ask for him ourselves and explained the latest disaster. Our server was very helpful for the most part, which was a good thing, but the potato skins that we ordered for an appetizer took nearly 30 minutes and when it came out it was skimpy to say the least. Two were missing any ingredients other than a hint of cheese (see pics).   When my burger finally arrived (the smokehouse burger with bacon), the top bun looked like it was run over by a bus and the patty itself was as flat as paper.  The wedge-cut fries were mangled in only a way that Freddy Krueger could produce. There was one piece of lettuce that looked as if it was wilted days before it was served. Disgusting and inedible. There was another couple sitting opposite us who also had a burger, and it looked completely fine. Very frustrating.  The manager visited our table on three separate occasions and to his credit tried to make the best of it. He advised that he is trying to make improvements to the location but after 3 years of hearing this I think I am finally listening to my inner-Arthur. The trust is not there and I am fed up.  I have been to many BJ's locations around the country and most have been wonderful.

Our server was inattentive and rude.  If we had any complaints, she was prompt to pass the buck to her coworkers - Service is slow? oh that's because she's busy doing the work of others and there are huge parties.  I understand, there were a few huge parties there last night, so everyone was slammed.  Maybe warn us before we sit down that things might run a little slow or the kitchen could possibly be backed up - we would have come back another time.  Food wasn't up to par (and it wasn't, two kid pizza that just had a sprinkling of cheese, no tomatoes/sauce, two very rare bison burgers that were requested as medium, one very well done steak that was requested medium rare, and two dried out mahi mahi tacos drenched in sauce to cover it up).  We pointed all of this out to her and the fact that it took over 45 min to get the food-- her response, ""oh, well, if I was the cook, this wouldn't happen"", and then she walked away.  No asking if we would like to have it taken back, or offer to get a manager, nothing.  Luckily we were smart and all ordered our kids' food as soon as we sat. It still took almost 20 min to get their food though, and then it was still another 20 minutes for our food.  After that, our server messed up our bill 2 times (this time she blamed it on the computer); at this point, we were just done (it had been 2 hours at this point with three little kids at 745pm), so we just paid the bill and then had to fix it among ourselves.  She didn't even remember to apply the bill to our rewards after reassuring us she had done so.  The times leading up to this, the waits have been longer and longer once we've been seated, the food has been incorrect or served cold, and the staff seems disinterested.  We've even had a few occasions where we've needed to speak with the manager on duty and that hasn't gone well.  I'm very disappointed that this location just isn't up to par anymore as the pizookie makes the world go round for my kids and they'll actually eat their dinner just to have one.  Hopefully the other locations are decent so I can continue dine with BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=320,2.88,3.08,3.08,2.7920000000000007,3.0000000000000004

The bar location has bull seating, along with some table tops and booths. There are many TV's displayed around the restaurant but the bar area has the most options. The overall restaurant has many table and booth seating's and even an area for large groups. Park is pretty standard at this location and on busy times you may have to park a little farther out. On this occasion I had early dinner with family. The drink menu is pretty extensive, mostly because they offer a large variety of beers. BJ's offers there own specialty brews, Today, I had the Tatonka Stout, very dark imperial stout, and a Brewhouse Blonde. Two completely opposite type beers but both are always a favorite when I'm in.  With a full bar and beers on tap and seasonal brews your certainly able to find something to your liking. Food has always been pretty good, I've had the steak before and was great and today I opted for more basic with the Chicken Club Sandwich and that was just as good. Chips and guacamole was a great appetizer as well, with the guacamole being a little spicy kick to it, not hot, just spicy.  The other 3 all enjoyed there food and drinks. At the end we decided to go for the BJ's Famous Pizookie, Chocolate chip and of course no disappointment here with vanilla ice cream in the center of of a warm baked chocolate chip cookie pizza!  I have been to another BJ's location in town and of course its just as on par with this location.

There are enough TVs to keep you occupied. I love the dark interior but there is still a very open feel with all the windows. Now, customer service is where the place could use some improvement. The waiters seem to be so busy and overwhelmed that they barely can catch their breath when they stop by your table. Food does tend to take about 10 minutes to come out but again with the amount of people ordering, I bet getting the food out rapidly is a bit of a challenge. The menu has something for everyone. Even the newly transitioned vegan that I have become can find a handful of items to munch on. Prices are comparable and right on for the atmosphere.

Not her fault. She had two three tops, a four top, a eight top and a seven top. That's just piss poor management. Don't spread your staff so thin. My three top had intentions of putting in some work on beers but only got 2 after flagging her down. The other big parties waited for at least 10 minutes just to get drinks.

They had a 20% off promotion if you order ahead on their app for dine in. So my family and I ordered on the B.J. app an hour before we arrived(we even called half an hour before arriving to make sure they got our orders). Once we were seated, no one served us. No drinks. No plates. Not once had our waitress stopped at our table. We were even ignored whenever we tried to call for any waiter walking by.  A huge group was seated right next to us 15 mins later and they were able to get their drinks before we did, and we were there before them AND ordered ahead an hour before we arrived! Ten minutes after, we were so close to walking out when our appetizer finally arrived, the waiter just placed it there and walked away immediately. At least they didn't fully forget about us. But, with no plates and no service, my family of 6 huddled around that one plate of appetizer to eat. It was horrible. I truly considered using the table or napkin as a plate. I lost track of time after that because it didn't really matter at that point, but we finished picking off our appetizer and we were all thirsty and irritated(still no drinks) when my dad got fed up and tried to get the waitress' attention in front of him. She looked him in the eyes and continued to walk away from us. After trying to get any waiters' attention, he stood up and walked to one of the managers, himself.  Apparently no one knew how to deal with dine ins with online orders so they all ignored us. Why promote something your own workers are not trained to deal with? The manager tried to help out after that and even assigned us our own waiter to make up for the lack of service, which I appreciated his effort, but at that point we just wanted to finish eating so we can get out of there ASAP.

106,Michael H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1651,83,1304.0,5.0,2016-01-11,"This is the fastest I have EVER chosen to update my review from barely a week ago. I mention this to further attest to the seriousness to which I attach this addendum to my original review. It is not something I do often (or ever, actually) and I apologize for the need to do so, but given the turn of events, I feel that this update is required and is not done in a post haste mindset.  Now, I specifically said in my original review that the reason that I chose to give BJ's a 4/5 star review was due to their decision to remove a long standing menu item that had been offered in their menu for well over a decade. The menu item in question is their former proprietary ""Cobb Sandwich"" which was removed from their menu approximately two years ago.  After I posted my review, a customer service representative from BJ's commented on my review and said the following: ""Hi Michael, Thank you for your comments. We can still make the Cobb Sandwich for you, the only difference would have to use ranch instead of the creamy garlic dressing. Just let us know and we will be more than happy to make it for you.  Thank you.  Frank Acosta"" Though I have not had the opportunity as yet to test this offer, I am trusting that Mr. Acosta being an employee and public representative of BJ's, is certainly speaking the truth. The next time I go to BJ's I will certainly order my favorite sandwich and can certainly get over the fact that ranch will replace the creamy garlic dressing of the original. This is much more minor of an update versus New Coke and Coke Classic. Yes, I realize that it potentially opens the doors of High Fructose Corn Syrup in CocaCola Classic versus original Coke, but that is a debate for another time (and Mexican Coke, made with real sugar, is all I carry in my fridge anyway).  I personally wanted to thank Mr. Acosta for his comment on my review and thank BJ's in general for twenty years of delicious bar food in a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  BJ's Brea was my headquarters through the mid to late 1990's and I still go there whenever we make it back to the old OC.

We ordered our food. I like these fries they have (or used to have) with pork and green salsa. They removed them from the menu a couple months ago, but when I went in tonight, they were back on the menu - so I ordered them. After several exchanges with the waitress in between about how we think our orders are wrong (and her telling us they weren't), we finally got our bill. Amy S., our server, charged us for pork sliders, which are nearly double the price of the pork fries. I bring it up, along with our points for a discount, and she tells me their not on the menu. I told her they were and that's why I ordered them, and she says they're not and they have to charge me for these sliders instead. I am very disappointed after this trip. I don't see how it's my fault that I ordered what's being shown on the menu.  Absolutely no attempt to make it right, she only told me how I am wrong, then gave me my bill back to pay.

We went for a large family dinner to celebrate my son's birthday. The server, Sita, seems to dislike her job very much. As soon as we mentioned we would like separate checks, she acted as if the world was going to crumble. She demanded that we stay in the same seats, so as not to mess her up. She made a comment such as ""Oh geez, this is going to be difficult"". This type of restaurant should be used to handling large parties, as there were at least 3 others larger than ours. Even though the server made a point to write seat numbers down, the food was still auctioned off at the table. At least 4 different servers brought out our food out. This in itself is not a problem, however, my wife's food never came out, and I had not seen a server come to the table in over 10 minutes after the last plate was put down. Finally our server comes over, and I tell her my wife's food was completely missing. She tried to give some excuse, but there is no for us to wait 10 minutes to be told her food is going to be late because the server screwed up. My wife's food (which was a simple burger) did not come until after everyone else was finished, and had to rush through her meal. When the manager came by, I informed him I would not eat until my wife had my food, and then my steak would be cold. He did offer to bring me another steak, so that my wife and I could eat together. This second steak arrived to the table before my wife's first burger. So here I am with a second plate of food before my wife even had a single bite to eat.  Disgraceful.

Hostess at the check in station was very pleasant and polite, as was our server Willis despite the rest of the staff who didn't appear to be the least be pleased to be at work.  Willis was as amazing as the menu selections and the house made root beer.  One of my dinner friends is a total jokester and was on point tonight and Willis played along with the cracks and jokes very well.   On to the food we shared an appetizer of the California flat bread which was very good, the garlic aoli would have been good on anything! Two of us ordered steaks and the other ordered the BBQ brisket burger.  I know people think it is crazy to order a steak well done, but I don't like blood or red coming from anything I eat so I ordered my steak well done.  This was the negative of the night, when my steak was brought to the table there was pink juice on the plate I gave the benefit of the doubt until I cut open the steak and it was MAYBE Medium to Medium Well but definitely NOT done.  Willis appeared with in moments and took my steak back to have it finished to a well done.  Glad I had enjoyed my salad with ranch (also very good but seemed house made as it had a different flavor) and my baked potato from my main course to enjoy until the streak came back.  It came back and was done enough to cut and enjoy, I had to add salt to the steak as it had no flavor other than a lot of char.  I realize cooking a well done steak takes some finesse and know how to not burn the outside but get the inside complete, I just wont order a steak here next time.  The other steak that was ordered did get delivered cooked correctly but he also commented that it lacked seasoning.  The brisket burger was enjoyed along with both types of fries were tried at the table and we all enjoyed them both.  Over all there are quite a few things I wouldn't mind trying here, sure we'll be back at some point when my husband returns home because he enjoys tasting crafted beers.

I typically get pizza.  Desert is always good but I'm usually too full to get it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=200,3.28,3.17,3.256,2.7359999999999998,3.214
70,Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",446,156,1233.0,1.0,2016-05-17,"Came here for happy hour which is 5-7PM. Their happy hour menu is limited and you can only have it at the bar which mean max 6-7 people can come because there isnt enough seating at the bar for a big group. 7 of us were forced to cram onto a small table, so there wasnt enough room to put more than 2-3 dishes on the table at a time. 1/2 off small deep dish pizzas which can feed 1 person (4 slices) and 1$ off wine- we had to order 6 pizzas for 6 people. The beer wasnt even worth getting on happy house so we just got pitchers cause it was cheaper. But they do brew their own beer here.  Recommend: Hefeweizen and the Stout. Blonde taste like water/coors light/bud light- nothing special. We ended up ordering the flat bread, calamari, nachos (which we didnt know were on the menu) and drinks as well as 5+ deep dish pizzas. THE DEEP DISH PIZZAS ARE TO DIE FOR! i mean i can tell they were clogging my arteries as I ate them but Damn were they delish the flat bread was ok, calamari was not bad, the worst thing was these half ass nachos that came with a small dollop of sour cream and even smaller dollop of gauc. Plus it didnt have meat on it just a haphazard mix of beans and cheese. Def dont recommend the nachos The reason this place gets 1 star is due to 1 person and 1 person only: THE BAR TENDER NAMED TREVOR Heres the story: My friend who was getting married had never tried a car bomb. I decided to get her one. This A**hole TREVOR decides to pour use 1/4 of a pint of Guinness and then 1 total (1/2 shot jameson and 1/2 baileys). To all that have ever ordered a car bomb: IT IS  1 PINT of GUINNESS 1 shot of Jameson poured into the GUINNESS 1 shot of baileys on the side.  (Yes and I realize there is more than 1 way to make it but this is the way I've had it for the last 10 years- and my mom used to be a bartender!!!)  For those our thinking this is just me and my friends trying to get more alcohol or that it was about the money- it is not. I WAS MORE than willing to pay for him to make the drink I was accustomed to.  Anyways I go to the bar explain to Trevor this is not a car bomb and he argues with me saying it is that if he pours more Guinness that the cup will over flow. This guy is trying to serve me some Shitty 1/4 cup guinness and wants my friend to drop her shot glass into it where it will shatter and she will literally be chugging shards of glass. He tells me he wont do anyting about it so i call the manager who finally fills the PINT up only 1/2 way because TREVOR is a douche and he cant say no to the manager even though he knows well that it is supposed to be 1 PINT full (although when I asked the manager he never had a car bomb- so i dont blame the manager). And to prove to the manager I google the recipe and showed it to the manager and told him, his employee was arguing with me to which he did NOTHING. HORRIBLE SERVICE and management. I mean i just showed you the recipe and your going to tell me that Im wrong and not have your employee fix the drink? TREVOR is incompetent and TREVOR should be fired. The guy cant even make a proper drink.  DEF dont recommend getting a drink from him. And if you do check cause he has not had training with bartending. For all i know he said he put the 1/2 shot of jameson that was supposed to go into the drink, but for all i know he is lying and there was no jameson to begin with. NOT TO BE TRUSTED HORRIBLE bartender, service was decent from our waiter (a filipino guy).  Bottom line- a few more ounces of Guinness wasn't going to screw over his tab, but it was going to make me and my 6 girlfriends very happy- esp my gf who was getting married! And Trevor really ruined our experience there. He choose to fight with me instead of providing good customer service, all over a few ounces of beer.  TiP if you decide to get past the horrendous-ness that is TREVOR, download the app: 1) you can pay your tab on it 2) you get reward points toward future visits 3) you get a free dessert which you can redeem if you show to your waiter- We got a free Pazooki",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=60,3.16,3.14,3.248,2.34,3.1480000000000006

123,Supatra P.,"Las Vegas, NV",234,19,19.0,1.0,2016-05-18,"I am very disappointed at BJS tonight .. I never had horrible service here, but today was just not good from the beginning .  I believe I came in around 830 , maybe 9. Regardless, they close at 11.  Service starts from the time you enter the restaurant . The hostess said ""hello"" but it was not welcoming at all . I understand the POS is what you use to see who got sat , who's leaving etc, but that screen isn't going anywhere . She honestly did not look up while she asked me ""how many people, or even when she said hello"" til I asked her why I was getting waited 15 min ( bc I needed a high chair and I need a table that wouldn't violate safety measures, understandable). She didn't smile at all . Even people that were leaving the restaurant , she was still looking at the POS and said ""BYE"" . It was very insincere .  So we waited a little , then we got sat . I think we were the last table this server was gonna have or something? Because we got rushed from the time we sat til we paid out.  I'm not sure if it's because we look like kids,or bc I wanted to do a BJS special promo , but she treated us with such haste , and didn't really check up on us.  The only person that was really nice and made conversation was the food runner.  Even though he came around once, he was human and wasn't like a robot doing his job . I understand rush , but it wasn't busy ..  Regardless of bad service all around , I gave her 10 on 40, which is decent tip. Just want to remind servers , don't judge a book by its cover , don't rush customers , don't assume I'm being cheap bc of the promos you have .  Please, if your shift is over or if you have to go somewhere , let a customer know, instead of not saying anything and giving me the check when I didn't even get my dessert . Even asking for what dessert I want when I'm still eating my pizza . I would understand more if you told me your shift was ending or something . I didn't expect this type of service here .  I came here because of a food promo, but mostly because I wanted the delicious pizookie , but it definitely felt like a home that I wasn't welcomed too ..

Just be quiet OK I ordered curb side pick up a large deep dish pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza. That's exactly what I got no friggin sauce on it. Who makes a pizza without sauce they should stick to other things and leave the pizza making to an Italian place. But I'm also pissed because the girl that came out to bring my pizza told me since it was half off on Monday when you order any large pizza my bill was 12 and some change. She asked me if I would like hot peppers or Parmesan cheese I said no then you would have to go back inside then she says I have to go inside anyway to get your change so I said that's OK she says oh thank you very much and walks in thinking I may keep the change when I met I did not want any hot peppers or Parmesan. This was just a fail all the way around I will never patronize this business again never.

355,Mike H.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,1,,1.0,2016-07-14,"Second review I've ever posted on yelp... this place was terrible. We had a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night with 4 adults and a couple kids. When we were finally seated, it took about 10 minutes to get waters, them another 20 to get chips and guacamole. The oil the chips were fried in was rancid, and the chips were extremely salty. We weren't given any plates for appetizers, so we all had to balance the salsa and guacamole on the chip a full arm's length every time we are one. Our food was brought out after another 20 minutes, but half the food was missing.  Another 15 minutes went by (we're now over an hour of sitting at the table) before the server told us he didn't know what was taking so long and the manager was going to come by... the manager just asked if everything was alright. Obviously if she had to come talk to us, everything was not alright. We were at a business dinner, so we tried to be nice about, and because we didn't make a big fuss, nothing was done beyond that... another 10 minutes went by after the manager left before the remainder of the food was finally brought out. By this time, the first food was getting cold, and our waters had only been refilled once during this time. The guacamole burger was also extremely salty, but the fries were good... Too bad we had to ask for ketchup three times before it was finally brought out. The waiter only stopped by our table twice on his own, the rest of the time we had to flag him down. We got the pizookie sampler for the table, and once again no plates were brought out to use until we had to wait another 5 minutes to flag down the waiter for plates (by this time the ice cream was of course melted). So after almost 3 hours total, we finally survived dinner. If you're looking for over-priced, mediocre food and terrible service in an overcrowded restaurant, this is the place for you!

245,Alisha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,47,3.0,3.0,2016-07-17,It was ok at best. My husband and I have been there before and I should have just ordered a pizza because I know they are pretty delicious. We went with some friends and the 4 of us where sat by by a group of 20-25 people. Nothing a restaurant can do with loud groups but it would have been nice if they had made an effort to not cram a bunch of tables around a large party. Our friends and i felt like we had to yell and kept getting bumped into by the large party. Our server wasn't very attentive however there was a good runner you made sure we had refills. Back to the food...I ordered a burger which was ok. My problem is that the burger came out 10min after everyone else's food had hit the table. Server didn't come by to check if all food was ok. By the time I got my burger it was luke warm at best and my fries were cold. Knowing it was busy I ate what I could. Our server never came back to our table so as he was walking by I had to ask him for out check. He proceeded to go take another tables order ring that in and bring another table some drinks and then give us our check. I don't know if I'll be back maybe just order a pizza for take to avoid the mess of the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=240,2.88,3.08,3.172,2.476,3.0000000000000004

28,Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",990,1138,6857.0,3.0,2016-07-25,"3.5 STARS : Very Good    The second best part about hiking is what happens after the hike. That is the tradition of the post-hike supper. A few weeks ago after my brother and I hiked on the Cathedral Rock Trail, this very B.J's served our post-hike supper.    Dining out in B.J's made sense. Earlier this year following Norm K's Hike at the Potato Knolls, my Yelp friend Rob. W and myself went to their Summerlin location for a post-hike lunch. As my review implied, I enjoyed their jalapeño burger and the experience. Now I was returning to their second of three Las Vegas locations.     When my brother and I pulled into the parking lot, we saw that it was nearly filled up with cars. We walked into the restaurant expecting a wait. That wasn't the case because this large restaurant /brew pub accommodates a lot of people. When we walked in the woman at the podium pointed toward the back of the restaurant where we sat ourselves at a booth. Walking toward the booth in this urban style restaurant, we walked alongside the bar to the right and a room of tables to the left. What is unique is that there were zero signs of gaming. On the other hand there were signs of drinking. At the back wall I saw their microbrewery barrels. It is my understanding that B.J's is the recipient of many awards for their beer. Anyhow, we were here for the grub.     A few minutes after sitting down, our waitress introduced herself and soon returned with my glass of Coke. If you are a cola fan like myself they also serve black cherry cola and other unique flavors. At this point in the review, I will summarize the service as being good for a busy restaurant.    Just like the time I visited the B.J's in Summerlin, it was a slight challenge deciding what to eat. Then I laid eyes on their brand new Triple Decker ($11.25).    B.J's picked a winner with the Triple Decker. I was impressed. The sandwich bread was a hoagie. Within the hoagie were sliced roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss cheese. Complimenting the cold cuts were lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes, Italian dressing, and mustard. Finally, on top of the hoagie were a couple of sliced pickles. The pictures below this review supports the fact that the Triple Decker was loaded with cold cuts.    In reality, this is really a Quadruple Decker. I say this because B.J's gives customers the choice of regular fries or potato wedges. I am a fan of potato wedges. The Potato wedges adjacent to the Triple decker tasted very good. Kudos to B.J's for offering the choice of potato wedges or fries.    In conclusion, B.J's was a very good choice after hiking on the Cathedral Rock Trail. I give it my 3.5 STARS stamp of approval.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas?start=20,2.76,3.02,3.144,2.636,2.9160000000000004

Finally, it was served and my son was already done with his burger and he didn't want to eat it.  My son asked for a box to a waiter that was walking by, my son asked, ""Excuse me sir, may I have a box?"".

I returned home at 10 pm, which is a little late to eat and avoid a night of heartburn.  I threw out the warm lettuce and hoped the salmon might taste good the next morning in an omelette or such.  This chain needs to either train their staff better or hire more staff to get the Friday night crowd handled efficiently.  Just get the job done right the first time!

My daughter's milk did not come out with the rest of the drinks (explain this to a 4 year old who has already been sitting at a table for 20 mins).

The horrible customer service that your takeout section provided me today, leaves me baffled because usually I love coming here for takeout and everyone previously has always been so nice.  Today I walked into your takeout section, was was blatantly ignored by your staff. Including a guy in a button up shirt, who I'm assuming is a manager? I walked in and stood there while they continued their conversations with cellphones in hand. Almost as if they were waiting for one of their other coworkers to make contact with me so they would be forced to help. Talking and laughing amongst each other and having personal conversations while helping me. Just so unprofessional.  I came in, and although I made my order hours in advanced- when I got there my order wasn't complete....I ordered HOURS in advance. I get it, it may have been busy and no biggie I can wait a couple minutes. But then the girl helping me, asked the other girl to go grab my side items- it made me feel like I was a nuisance and she didn't even say sure! I'm sorry about that! Or of course no problem! It was a scuff and then came  back with hardly anything in my side cups.  I just can't believe it, and as a manager I HIGHLY recommend that you review your staff and retrain them on how to deal with customer and guide hem on customer service.

First of all our server took forever to take our order, only to discover that they had given us an old menu and I happened to order something that is no longer on their menu. So we had to figure that all out about 15 minutes after we ordered and they said they would just make something like it. Well it had turkey and bacon, but clearly wasn't the same , but that was better than my husband we ended up getting a chili quest dip for his meal instead of the pale Ale chili he ordered. We didn't want to have to wait forever so he just ate a bit of it  when our server finally came around again, we told him he brought the wrong thing so he offered to take it off our bill. Good since he only ate about 3 bites of it. We then asked to redeem our points to get a pizookie, but because it was taking so long we needed it to go. When the pizookie finally showed up, it was not to go!  They said it would take another 10 minutes or so to get another one to go. We said to forget it and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager showed up, we explained what happened, and she apologized, we asked to get our points back from the pizookie that they. Oils not manage to get done for us. We had now been there just shy of 2 hours. We were on a time schedule and could not nor did we want to wait around any longer. We just wanted our money back for the pizookie . The manager came back a few minutes later and e planned she could not refund that because we used their app to pay our bill!, are you kidding me.

With about 5 minutes to spare, Kim (server) quickly sat us at a bar booth & offered to get an order in for us. Unfortunately Thea app we chose didn't count as HH pricing. So, we order our drinks, a small plate app & our pizza.  Kim states she will get our app (queso & chips) out first to enjoy before our dinner. After waiting a very long time for app, I start to get concerned they are going to bring our app & dinner out together, we tell Kim it's taking a long time for chips & dip & if they're going b to bring them out back to back, we don't even want the app at this point. She stated she would go find out what's the delay is & let a manager know of the issue, and come talk to us. A few minutes later, our app comes out...and sure enough, a couple minute after that, our pizza comes! The guy who brought our pizza didn't even say anything. He quickly out it down & left. Not even a ""do you need anything else?"" Actually we did!  Kim came over, we reminded her we wanted ranch on the side. She quickly brought it & said she was going to remind the manager to come by the table. Seriously, your manager needs a reminder?! The place wasn't that busy!  Eventually the manager decided to stop by. I don't know her name, because she never told us. She squatted by the table as if she had no idea why she was there. I tell her the issue, her response was like, ""oh bummer"". No effort to see how she could improve our experience.  Management should know how to handle a situation & attempt a customer happy.

Ordered basic things along with a ""sprite"" (that is not the brand they have) which we were told the syrup was out and they had no more - we got one from the bar... - anyway, our food came but we waited another 6 minutes before we got utensils so food got cold. Not totally blaming the server but MAN service was bad. Our drinks ran out and other servers noticed and were pointing - 10 minutes later we got a refill. That was the theme of the night - waiting. On the table was a ""flyer"" that said if you download app and pay with it you get a free mini pizookie, we asked if we do that can we get a mini and the free regular. Our server said ""I will just bring you 2 regular ones"" - OK, great! We figured he was making up for our LONG, cold food night. After ordering pizookies then waiting another 20 minutes to get said pizookies - happy at last. I got the reward I was looking for. Finally the bill was dropped off - our server charged us FULL price for the 2nd pizookie we would not have ever ordered. We could not find him or anyone else and it was now 9:pm. I just put the exact amount of bill down - and left. Last time they ever get my business. Horrible service! Not sure if the food was any good as it was cold by the time we got to eat it.

We made a few trips back and forth with our drinks and food, and sat at our new table. We look up and they have switched it again back to the other side.  We had to again move our drinks and food across the whole bar to our original table.  They kept turning the game off, and we had to keep making them switch it back.  During the game we ordered $34 worth of food, and it was all pretty tasteless.  Nothing I would order again.

We did the sampler with the avocado egg rolls, cheese sticks, wings, and spinach artichoke dip. The dip was runny and gross, the egg rolls had no flavor besides avocado, but the cheese sticks and wings were ok. We didn't finish much of it. For dessert we did Oreo, chocolate chunk, and salted caramel mini pizookies. Meh, I don't get the hype. They're okay but they're really not all that great. We prefer the passion cookie at Streets of New York, but they were closed. They get two stars because the food was tolerable.  As far as service, I'd give Airica four stars.

Every employee that walked by my table said gross remarks and gave grossed out faces instead of CLEANING THE VOMIT OFF OF THE TABLE AND THE FLOOR. I then witnessed them using rags to clean the vomit up, put the vomit filled rags on THE FOOD TRAYS and re use the rags to wipe down the table. Again, since I said it was busy they quickly put the tables together for a large party to sit down. NOT AT ALL PROPERLY CLEANED. Working in the EMS field, I know how to clean up contaminated areas and using the same dirty rag over and over is not the way to do it. They didn't even mop! The next large party sat down, poor guy hit his legs on the bottom of the table, throw up was on it. He had throw up all over his legs, gross. No idea what's going on.. the manager then proceeds to play dumb and accuse the restaurant goer of coming in here with vomit already on his pants. Ridiculous. The manager definitely knew about the incident, since he walked the kid out. I leaned in and told the dude there was a little boy who threw up.

First time it was the Summerlin location, the follow Friday it was the Henderson location & this Friday it was the Centennial location & third time was not a charm.  My wife put us on the call ahead list & she was told it would be 15-20 minutes when she checked in. She informed the hostess of her desire for a full size booth, not the little, barely enough room booths they have. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our little booth & we only got seated after she went back & asked how much longer. There was an empty full size booth across from where we were seated & when we inquired about sitting there we were informed that a 4 person party was being seating, which was a lie. They seated two people 15 minutes before the other two people in their party arrived. Which restaurant sits half a party at rush time, BAD ONES!!! So we're seated & order a pretty simple dinner, two salads & boneless wings. Well the salads came out without dressing, no lie neither salad had dressing on them & the wings had the wrong sauce. To top it off one of my pet peeves happen, my glass sat empty for a while, empty until the waitress finally came back with our salad dressings. Instead of going into the kitchen for our dressing when she notice it was missing she filled ordered & came back with a tray full of glasses & our missing dressing.

Both times we were assured that all precautions were/would be taken against cross contaminaton but the fact that I'm sitting here in pain and ill... well, it tells a different story.  I believe the cross contamination comes from them using a serving ladle that's used for filling the bread bowls; ladle comes into contact with the bread bowl and then goes back into the pot of ""gluten free"" soup. I also wouldn't be surprised if there's a level of cross contamination coming from the rags/towels used to clean the plate from drips or to wipe off hands (even if they use gloves, I've seen chefs wipe gloved hands).  The food itself (Broccoli Cheddar Soup) was tasty... even the gluten free Pazooki! However, I can't in good conscious give a higher rating.

Bjs favorite is pretty classic. Red sauce, meatballs, pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, olives,  onions, and tomatoes.  You can order their pizza by halves so you can try 2 flavors or what have ya!  Three star rating because their service ain't consistent. We would order ahead and put ourselves on a waitlist. Upon arrival, we are still waiting at the lobby.. what's the point of the app sometimes. Well the app is good to download so you can earn points and get discount rewards in the future. Also, an option to order for curbside/takeout if dining in is not an option for you. Pazookies are their popular dessert. It's a Warm baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. They got various cookies to choose. (Chocolate chip, oreo, peanut butter, etc)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas,2.8,2.99,3.008,2.668,2.9139999999999997

Luckily, we were waited on by a very friendly waitress named ""Jennifer"". She was very attentive and eager to serve us with outstanding customer service. Too bad that the chicken wings that we ordered was still cold on the inside (kitchens doing). We didn't eat it and made sure to let her know. She was able to take that off our bill. Awesome!

However, there is no excuse for waiting to be acknowledged at our table, the server taking our order before our beverage order was ever taken, serving Fried Calamari cold twice, a soggy Santa Fe Salad that was mixed with the dressing so far in advance that the Romain lettuce was soggy. A fresh tossed salad looks like it has been freshly tossed when the lettuce is still light and crisp not in a heaping mound that resembles a salad in a doggy bag I brought home from a restaurant the night before. When the server took our order I asked for extra dressing on the side. It didn't come when the food was delivered so I asked for it. Never came. I asked another server. It never came again. I ordered the Santa Fe with the salmon option. After taking several bites I see that instead of removing the chicken for the salmon I got both which was not a tasty combination. My guest ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. The soup arrived in a plain dish. We told the server it was suppose to be in a bread bowl. He said to start on this one and he would bring another in the bread bowl. It came shortly after. Then to our surprise another server shows up with a clam chowder in a bread bowl ready to set it on the table. By this time I was so disappointed with this restaurant and quite embarrassed I even suggested bringing my parents here for Veterans Day. After this EPIC FAIL saving $$25.95 was no bargain. They made a poor first impression to new customers and changed a previous customers desire to ever return. The server took the calamari and clam chowder off our bill. Still the whole experience was a disaster! By the looks of things, I bet they did a lot of ""taking the item off the bill"" tonight.

If I have any complaint at all I think $6.75 for a well drink is outrageous because I know what it costs to pour that drink so for a ""locals"" hangout that can be a bit pricey.

This place is usually crowded because of the limited restaurant options this side of town. BJ's is a traditional American style restaurant/pizzeria/Brewhouse and I've been coming to this chain for over 10 years (I've even been to this location a few times). I love the blonde beer and coming here for happy hour (half off mini pizzas). Came here with my brother for dinner and I have to say, we got 1 star service. First, our server BARELY gave us the time of day. She was already walking away while I was trying to ask for barbecue sauce on the side (she forgot the barbecue sauce btw). I ordered a mini barbecue chicken and side of fries and it took 30 minutes for it to come out! (I took a picture of my timer, the timer says 20 minutes but I started the timer after waiting roughly 10 minutes already). The server NEVER refilled our waters either. It was just frustrating watching the server give a lot of attention to all the tables around us, but would barely glance at my tables direction. If the restaurant was packed and super busy, I could understand the neglect, but the restaurant wasn't even busy(I took pictures to show all the empty seats around me). I wanted to order a pizookie (they are delicious) to end my night but was turned off my the service I was receiving so much that I skipped dessert.
