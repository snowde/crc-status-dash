292,Rhommé M.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,3,,5.0,2014-11-12,I went in yesterday just because I wanted to try the West Coast renowned Pizookie. This was their 2nd day being opened for business. The service was great! The food was great! And the Pizookie.........WAS EVERYTHING! I ordered 1/2 Chocolate Chip & 1/2 White Chocolate Macadamia. The kitchen messed up & made 1 of each. So they gave me both at no additional charge!

316,Bryan K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,1,,3.0,2014-11-22,"A lot of beers on tap. Home brews are decent. I would recommend getting a flight (sample of 4). Their IPA and Stout were good.  Had a burger that was greasy and lacked any real flavor. This is a new place and they're working on a lot of kinks which affects the customer service,  but the staff works hard and tried to accommodate as best they can. I sat at the bar and they seemed overwhelmed mostly because things are new and there are bound to be issues.

I am not a fan of this appetizer as the shoe string fries are not my favorite also the green sauce I was not a fan it was tangy and bitter not ideal. For drinks we both did the sampler of 4. Which we enjoyed but the ones you end up not wanting you are stuck with. As for the meals I got the Southern Fried Chicken which was tender juicy crisp and well seasoned. My BF got the ribeye which had fat all the way through which he is not a fan of.  The desert was delicious, we ordered the 3 trials i forget the name. We got the peanut butter smores one, cookies and cream, and salted caramel. Delicious heaven, I don't typically eat desert but the waiter talked us into it and I am glad I did. Overall I will def go back.

The floors are super slippery, it feels like you're ice skating & even the staff will admit it to you. The food is pretty pricey $25 for a pizza. (It was good.) The handicap section is not Accommodating as well, it's too tight & uncomfortable. The main reason for the such low review is the management.

When I found out they were opening up a BJ's across the street from me you can imagine my excitement. I'm not typically a fan of chain restaurants except for BJ's. I've been here 4 times since they opened a little over 2 weeks ago and my experience with the food was consistent. I always order either the Pizza or the Santa Fe Salad along with their famous Pizookie for dessert. YOU can not enter and leave without having a Pizookie - that would be just wrong. The BEST server I've had so far was Patricia. Very funny, knew the menu, was quick on her feet and didn't have us waiting. I had 2 visits and the servers weren't as great but I will give them a pass since its a new restaurant- however I will ask for Patricia the next time I visit. Gotta stick to what you know right?

I've been going to BJS for the past 7 years so I know what to expect. My visit there yesterday 11-28-14 for lunch with my husband was Ok. It could've been better. The prices for some reason we're higher then cali. Also the menu was different. For appetizer, I ordered shrimp thai lettuce wraps and they were delicious. My husband ordered a small Mediterranean pizza and enjoyed it. I ordered lunch size pasta which on the menu was $8.95 (it was 8 something) but was charged 13+ for it. Their reason was because I ordered shrimp instead of chicken. I wish I was informed prior to ordering that 8 small shrimps on my pasta would've been $5 extra. And when you can count your meat, it's not good. I was not very happy with that. Our server apologized and that's about it. Overall service was good. Our food came out on time.

328,Bri H.,"Washington, DC",1562,128,1364.0,4.0,2014-12-04,"I came here Monday night for a random Happy Hour with my friend, which was much needed after the day I had. I actually wasn't originally going to go to BJ's but my friend suggested it. Although I really wanted to go to one of my ""go to"" spots for Happy Hour, I decided why not....lets try something new! It turned out to be a GREAT NIGHT! I love this place so much! Right when you walk in, the hosts are very sweet and nice, and the ambiance is incredible. It was packed! We sat at the bar and we were greeted immediately by one of the bartenders and he told us about the HH Specials. We decided to get the HH Pizza, HH Comso, HH Egg Rolls, and the HH Strawberry Mojito. Let's start with the drinks .... The Cosmo was okay, not as strong as I would have liked but it still tasted pretty good. The Mojito was a little too sweet for my taste but my friend seemed to really like it. I would say they could up the liquor measurement a bit, just a splash or two. Now the food - INCREDIBLE! So tasty and it came out super-fast. The pizza was crispy and flaky while the egg rolls were PACKED with flavor. They are a must if you visit BJ's. After two more drinks, we thought, ""We are at a brewhouse and have yet to order beer, THE HECK"" hahaha so we did just that. We ordered the beer flight tasters and we chose two beers each to drink. The best and I mean the best beer was the Grand Cruz! I could cry it was sooooooo good! MMMMHHMMM. We then decided, why not get fatter? So we ordered wangs to go with our beers and ordered the BBQ & Parmesan Wings. They were actually pretty good. They parmesan wings aren't my cup of tea, but the BBQ wings were on POINT! Overall, the staff is super nice (the bartenders are funny and easy to talk to), the food is amazing, and the drinks are good but could use a splash more of the good stuff. Lmao. I will most definitely be back for future Happy Hours! :) Favs - HH Pizza and HH Egg Rolls are phenomenal. Definitely signature items for them. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. Great STAFF!!  Would Change - HH Drinks were weak ...

Granted it was quite busy for a Tuesday night but the service was atrocious and I saw enough servers and bussers around that I was expected a better experience.  First off, we felt extremely rushed to order everything. It was my friend and I's first time here so we were checking out all our options. Our drinks didn't come out for a very long time, and after asking if they would be out soon they miraculously arrived leading me to believe the bar wasn't as backed up as the server stated.  We ordered our appetizer first then the server came back to take out entree order. Lo and behold our entree came out before the appetizer! Which of course was then blamed on the kitchen as well. Honestly the only reason I gave this a one star was because the food was pretty good and the drinks were pretty good as well especially for the reasonable price.  As for the service itself, we felt extremely rushed and if I'm going to be rushed I at least expect the product to come out quickly.. Which it did not. When our entree arrived before our appetizer we didn't even have any silverware and after asking for some, we waited for a bit then received two forks on top of a black napkin. I had already looked around and saw other customers with black napkin rolls of silverware so wondered why we did not receive the same thing. I then had to ask for a second napkin since we had only received one and also for the side of sour cream I had ordered that did not come out with the food. I also asked the food runner when he brought the food out but didn't get it then either. I was made to feel like I was being demanding but all I was asking for were items necessary for eating the meal that I shouldn't have had to ask for.  And to top it all off our food and drinks were cleared while we still had a few bites and sips left but if our server bothered to ask us we would have asked for a few more minutes to finish. Then she dropped off the check without a word and without asking us if we wanted dessert. Which we had ready decided we did want and had to try and add on as our server zoomed by.

I have given them two tries and both times it took forever. The first time we arrived around 7pm and ordered a glass of wine, 4 waters, 1 pizza, 1 appetizer and a pazookie for dessert. Easy enough. The wine took 20 minutes to come out and the whole dining experience took about two and a half hours. That's how slow service is. The food was pretty good, but I don't have all day to sit at this establishment. The second time I ordered carryout. I parked in the alloted space and called the number on the sign upon arrival as directed and..... no answer. It took about 3 minutes for someone to pickup. Finally a friendly guy came out to our car and took my card back in to charge it. What is this, 1992? With all of the technology now available, as well as credit fraud, why does BJ's force this kid to run all over the place? Get an Ipad and let the customer swipe their own card. I mean, I have been to locations where you can pay on your phone at the table, so why this antiquated method of payment? After all of this, our food still wasn't ready and we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for carryout we called in 30 minutes prior. This location needs help.

Unfortunately, each time has been the same and we actually take tally now of how many times we think they will mess up our order(s), before we arrive. For one, they are extremely slow. They do not refill your drinks unless you ask and no matter what you order, don't expect them to get it right. I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. It is truly a shame because their food is very good and they are going to loose business over this. While their food is good, they are very stingy on the vegetable toppings on pizza and pastas. If you ask for mushrooms, I literally think they count 3-4 of them and throw them on your plate, just to say they gave you extra. Then they charge you $2.00 for the extra toppings. It is ridiculous.

As we stood there, she says, "" you can go on over there"". *** This is super disappointing since we didn't know ""which"" table we were walking to, and there was no greeting or any kind of service at this point. Once we arrive to this table... It was dirty, and not even ready. So we go back to the hostess, and she says, ""just go over there and sit down, they will clean it for you soon"".  Once we wait for THAT to happen, we sit and wait for a server to come over and get our drink orders or ANYTHING for that matter, and 10 minutes later..(no joke) he comes with a napkin and says, "" I'll be with you in a minute"". 15 minutes for that, 10 minutes for refills and 20 minutes for the overall checkout process. For nonalcoholic drinks, appetizer and two burgers, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes. Quite disappointing.  For the food aspect: Burgers were over greasy, and one was overcooked.

My first time, I went during lunch with a friend and sat at their bar.  Since it was slow, the bartender was always there when we needed her. I enjoyed their deep dish pizza (which is now something I get every time), along with trying my friends BBQ Lunch Platter. The chicken was sooo good!! I went back another time with a  different friend. She was very indecisive, and despite being busy, the waitress was patient. She also gave great recommendations. I tried the deep dish lasagna, which I wish had more pasta. I found it to be a bit over loaded with cheese. My friend ordered a mixed drink that was recommended by the waitress as well. We found the drink to be entirely too strong and sweet, so it was hard  for her to finish. At my third visit, I took my boyfriend, who has a gluten allergy. He had the gluten free pizza and really enjoyed being able to pick his own toppings. I ordered the deep dish pizza again, and had a side of their fires (they are to die for!!) Overall we had a great visit, with one exception. We were seated near the bar area, where there was a large group of extremely LOUD women. Although that was no fault of the restaurant, it did hinder the experience just a bit. At my most recent visit, I took my office staff for lunch. I again had the deep dish pizza, but this time with a Cesar salad. My boss had the BBQ platter that I recommended, two of the girls has Chicken Club Sandwiches with fries but they were only able to finish half, as they were large portions. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our waiter was slightly less attentive, but it was a busy lunch hour. One thing they did was constantly brought out new soda before someone would finish.

Comfy room, subdued lighting but there are downward spots so you can actually read the menu. The headliner here is, of course, the beer.  I got a sampler of four house brews for $7.95. All were well made, true to type, and just a bit edgy, showing that the brewmaster was going for good and not just good enough. Feeling hungry, I went for the full rack of baby backs. The ribs were tender and moist, with a sauce/glaze that was savory and just a bit sweet. Not a hint of smoke, though. A tiny bit of chiplotle would have gone a long way. Mashed potatoes were excellent in flavor and texture. The roasted Brussels sprouts were a great idea as a healthier choice, but poorly executed. They were quartered, which lead to uneven cooking, and dry. I use Jacques Pepin's recipe, using the slicing blade on the food processor and tossing with a bit of olive oil.  Service was friendly. There is free WiFi but like many places you need to open the browser and agree to the terms. There are some good HH specials, and quite a few lighter options.

Luckily, the weather was nice that night so we just stepped outside and the time passed quickly. Our server was very nice, though he kept making jokes under his breath to entertain us and expected us to laugh, but we could never quite hear him so it just turned into an awkward 5 seconds of silence each time.  I am not sure if it was just a really busy night or if the kitchen isn't well staffed (or both) but it took foreverrrrr for our drinks to come out and then another foreverrrrr for our food to come out. This wasn't much of a problem for us since my friends and I had a lot to catch up on, but it's not the ideal spot if you are in a hurry. I ordered their jalapeño burger which was good (and huge!), but not far as tasty as the description on the menu makes it seem.   With all of the new restaurants in the area - there wasn't anything quite memorable about this one that would make me return rather than try out a new place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=120,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.1800000000000006,3.4400000000000004

It was more like  a strawberry lemonade. I was with a party of 10 people. The waitress, Carolina,  was a peach but was clearly overwhelmed with such a large group along with other customers because we had to wait at least 10-15 minutes before we saw her. It was almost an hour from the time that we entered the restaurant until we received our food.  The black and bleu house burger was pretty good but a little dry and the fries were greasy. The triple dessert platter was a sure winner. I had the cookies and cream cookie and ice cream. It was both warm and gooey with a perfect combination of sweet creamy ice cream.

88,Rae M.,"Bowie, MD",340,377,524.0,4.0,2015-04-10,"What  a wonderful addition to the once desolate Laurel Towne Center. Located to your immediate left as soon as you enter the new shopping center, a small parking lot is adjacent from the restaurant, but your best bet is to park across the street in the bigger parking lot.  Myself and a few others planned  an outing here with a group of 11 awesome people, on a Thursday evening.  BJ's is known for their large variety of beers, I didn't partake, but I heard positive reviews about them. Our server, Caroline, was rather busy with such a large table of people, but she stayed on top of our table's needs. She did all this while being extremely pleasant and helpful.  With such an extensive menu, it was really hard to decide what to get. Who am I kidding, I'm on a pseudo diet, so I knew I couldn't order what I really wanted...a burger or pizza, so I  ordered from the ""enLIGHTened"" menu.  Every item on that particular portion of the menu is under 795 calories. I decided on the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a side of bistro grains. I don't have a clue what the bistro grains were (even after I ate it) but the entire dish was under 700 calories and they were really tasty, so I wasn't complaining. My meal as a whole was actually really good. I could see myself ordering it again (clearly while on this pseudo diet though).   Our table also indulged on a few appetizers, one of which I can't remember the name of, but it was good. The one I remember was the avocado egg rolls and they were surprisingly really good as well.  All and all, a good time was had by all. The service, the food, the lively atmosphere,  and of course the fabulous company were all truly wonderful! I will definitely be back in the future...clearly after this ""diet"" has died down!  Beer and burgers....HERE I COME!   PS I love the colorful and festive bar area. Check out the HH.

I was a little sad when my party already had a table in the back.  The rest of the restaurant is nicely put together.  It attracts friends, first time daters, and families young and old. Food:  I was hungry, but the menu was overloaded with items and I could not make up my mind.  This reminded me of the menu for Cheesecake Factory.  There are a lot of choices, which is great, but I wasn't feeling the food.  The lack of eating is partly my fault because I should have reviewed the menu online before I entered the restaurant. Beer:  I ended up having a lovely Tatonka Stout beer.  This beer was malty with notes of chocolate.  It was a great way to end the day.  I will definitely try more of the beers considering BJ's offers beer flights.  I also like the fact that the coaster that comes with the beer highlights the name and a few notes about the beer.

90,Hope L.,"Fort Washington, MD",494,284,847.0,3.0,2015-04-10,"Went here on a Thursday night to meet a group of friends. Upon arrival I gave the hostess our name for reservations, she looked up the reservations, told me she would be right back and that was that. She was gone for about 15 min. Finally another hostess came up and I asked her was everything ok and she said ""yes, she is getting your table ready."". I'm thinking geesh would've been nice if the 1st hostess had shared with me why she was leaving instead of giving me a weird look (like uh oh your reservation isn't on here), say she'll be back and leave me with thoughts of ""is everything ok? what's going on?"".  She returned about 15 minutes later and showed me to our table. It was a long table set up for about 15 people. Seating arrangement definitely could've been a little better. It was a little cramped because we were right up against a wall and the path between us and the next table was very small.  Our waitress came over shortly after and introduced herself. Her name is Carolina and she was a doll. Unfortunately, throughout the night you could tell that she was overwhelmed because we had to wait a good 20 min before we placed appetizer orders, she was gone for long periods of time throughout the meal. Especially at times we really needed her. Like to order more drinks, clear the dishes off the table, etc. The entire ordering, eating, process was long/delayed. I'm assuming they were short staff but I really don't know.  Here's what I ordered and what I thought about my food;  Cajun Pasta - I added shrimp for a extra few dollars. The shrimp were very small and when I am paying a nice coin for a pasta dish with shrimp I expect for my shrimp to look like what I paid for. That was a little disappointing. Overall dish was a little too oily but it was good. Not sure if I would order this again but if I do I would leave the shrimp out.  Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Filled with chicken, black beans, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, cilantro, sweet corn, jalapenos and jack cheese. Topped with pico de gallo and served with our Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce. The wrapping wasn't crispy. Inside was mushy. Wasn't too pleased with this dish.  Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea - Weak. Tasted more Coca-Cola than anything. Wouldn't order it again unless it was a different bartender or s/he learn to make a good Long Island. Apple Martini - Too sour. The first thing I tasted was sweet and sour. Ugh! Was really off balanced.  I should have listened to my fellow diners who said the Lemon Drop and Cosmo were the best Martinis.  The Hostesses were very in-personable when I arrived. The person in this position is the first impression you get sometimes at a restaurant and I personally think you should be interactive with your customers especially when they first walk in. That wasn't the case this night because the both of them were very stand-offish when I arrived and didn't communicate clearly on what was happening.   The DINING experience was decent. Carolina did a good job. Wish they were fully staffed so that she could have tended to our table a little better. The DRINKING experience was disappointing. Bartender needs a little lesson or mixing drinks. Maybe I will return at some point but have no plans to do so anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.2120000000000006,3.4000000000000004

Not necessarily the place you should come to expecting top notch food and quality dining.   The food 3 stars, the customer service is more like 4 stars.  When we arrived they were ready and prepared; took no time for them to come around and get our orders. The one lady waiter was holding it down, she was very attentive and courteous.  We were able to enjoy happy hour prices on our drinks due to a server giving us incorrect info over the phone a week prior; Happy Hour is from 3 to 6 then it stops and picks up later that night from 10 until. The server told us 3 to 10pm, so the manager Jared was kind enough to honor what we were originally told. This is a good place to come back to watch a game, drop into quickly. They have quite a few vegetarian selections and a lite calorie menu as well. We sampled the avocado rolls (spring rolls) served hot with a soy dipping sauce. I had the chicken lemon thyme dish with mash potatoes; sounded and looked better than it tasted, by sole reason of the seasoning and sauces being average. The chicken wings weren't bad; fried hard and crispy, drizzled with buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. My HH special lemon drops were decent. Not a bad choice for a casual group after work. It was cool, I can say for our first PG UYE this was a pretty good choice-a common meeting ground with affordable drinks  and food prices.

I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza, but their deep dish pizza dough tastes amazing. The pizzokie is amazing. I've tried several of them, but their oreo cookie pizzokie is by far the best.  Service can be hit or miss. There were times where they are really slow and not terribly friendly, but there are a few servers who really do a great job and make you feel welcome. Their mobile app is neat as it lets you ""call ahead"" your spot, and this place can get pretty busy on weekends. One thing that was disappointing is that one day they ran out of mini deep dish pizzas. I don't know that this is a fact, but if you can still serve medium or large pizzas, wouldn't you be able to make a mini pizza, too? Unless, you are using pre-cut frozen dough.

118,Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1748,2174.0,3.0,2015-08-03,"Bottom Line:  Better than most chain restaurants with a decent beer selection. Located in the Towne Center at Laurel.  I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants but I never mind a trip to places like BJ's or Cheesecake Factory because I generally find that the staff is a little more refined, the food is better quality and the drink options are plentiful.  Here is my take on the Laurel BJ's: - The menu at BJs weighs about three pounds and is as long and varied as that as the Cheesecake Factory's.  Having said that, the nice thing about BJs is there is something on the menu for everyone.  Although BJ's is known for their pizza, my favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken with blanched brocolli and cheddar mashed potatoes.  - As should be expected when you have ""Brewhouse"" in the name, BJs offers a great selection of drought craft beer and their house beer is decent as well.  Their beer menu is nicely displayed on the wall in three sections:  craft beer, BJ's house brew, and local craft beer. I'm not one for girly-fruity drinks but on a hot summer day I actually do like their BJ's Berry Burst cider.  It doesn't taste much like a cider to me but rather a carbonated fruit drink, but not too thick, sweet or heavy.   - This BJs isn't as large as other locations I've been too but that is ok with me since less people means less noise.  The open air concept here and lots of hard surfaces can make for a noisy experience but during off-peak times the restaurant is quite comfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=40,3.68,3.27,3.27,2.9240000000000004,3.434

Our server, Tamara, was super sweet and I asked her to pick me a nice crisp white wine and since they were half price that made it taste even better. She chose Kendall Jackson Chardonnay and it was perfect. Husband had Hefeweizen which he gets nostalgic over since he used to live in Germany. Then we ordered the fried calamari - perfectly cooked - wasn't chewy - it was golden. The garlic aioli dipping sauce was yummy! Husband ordered a flatbread that had bacon/chicken/avocado - he was enjoying it. I had the stuffed mushrooms - it was full of flavor - spinach pesto was very good!

I've been pretty excited about the couple new craft beer places popping up around Laurel and didn't think twice about meeting up with some co-workers for the happiest of hours. Unfortunately this slowly turned into the saddest of hours. The place is pretty nice and the hostess was friendly, courteous but then the downhill slide began. I got to happy hour at BJ's with about 45 minutes to go. Order a beer, the house stout in nitro, and asked for a happy hour specials menu. At the same time my coworker ordered a bottle of Budlight. 20 minutes later none of the three had arrived. I understand a nitro beer doesn't pour quickly but a bottle of bud and a specials menu shouldn't take anymore than 10 minutes at most. 15 minutes later her beer came out a little warm, my beer came out fine and the food menu came out finally. 25 minutes later our server came back around but it was now past happy hour prices and I had no interest in spending any more money at BJ's. I can't say you should steer clear but be wary. I ended up meeting up with another and eating elsewhere.  Side note: My nitro house stout was one of the better stouts I've had. It had a creamy, smooth mouthfeel and good notes of chocolate on the nose and coffee in the body.

304,Marcel N.,"Chantilly, VA",0,3,,2.0,2015-12-18,"I came here a few times after they opened for HAPPY HOUR and found it to be appropriately priced for a relatively good quality of bar food. Nothing special but not bad and also affordable.  Half price wings, sliders, flat bread s, etc.  $4 drafts.  Happy Hour...right?  As another reviewer commented here, the happy hour specials are terrible now...an absolute joke.  You only save $1 off of $7 beers and $2 off of a $12 serving of appetizer wings.  There is nothing HAPPY about that.  Other appetizers are now priced in the same $12 range...and you get to save a meager $2 for Happy Hour.  Appetizers used to be half off and were priced at around $9.  You could get a plate of wings and a draft beer for about $10...Now, you better plan on $20.  You actually pay more now at Happy Hour than the original full price.  You now pay $9.25 for happy hour wings that used to be $9 at FULL PRICE and $4.50 at happy hour.  I will take my business to one of the local establishments that isn't intent on gouging people at Happy Hour.  I mean, really...who goes to Happy Hour to pay $18 for three draft beers? Took my wife there for Happy Hour and was very disappointed when the check came...don't go here expecting to save money at Happy Hour.  We saved $8 on a $60 check.  On top of it all, the service is very slow.  There is only one bartender on duty at Happy Hour responsible for the entire bar area in addition to making drinks for the restaurant.  Management has certainly found a way to increase their profit margins...one bartender and inflated prices.  TGI Fridays, Applebees or even Famous Daves offer a much more affordable happy hour.  If you do make the mistake of heading here for Happy Hour...be sure to bring plenty of patience and cash.  You have been warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=320,3.16,3.37,3.37,3.0800000000000005,3.286

It came out looking dry and cold the waitress asked if the manager came over and spoke with us we said no.

I tried the avocado egg rolls and I wasn't too thrilled about them. It had a kick but I felt like I've had better. I was able to get the BJ's classic ribeye with white cheddar mash potatoes and asparagus. That steak was everything!!!!! It was cooked to perfection. Great flavor and it wasn't dry. The mash potatoes and asparagus were great as well. I took some of my brother's fries and they were yummy. I tried some of my mother's sparkling raspberry lemonade and it was amazing. I recommend this place for anybody wanting a good steak on Laurel.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=220,3.12,3.37,3.37,3.3440000000000003,3.27
337,Rebecca C.,"Washington, DC",24,144,46.0,3.0,2016-01-05,"A perfectly fine choice for a date-- not dazzling but not bad either. The ""pizookies"" (warm cookies with ice cream) are especially good. I don't usually love cookies-and-cream desserts, but that pizookie was the best-- I'll get it again. Salted caramel was also very good, and Ghirardelli chocolate was good too (we got the $9.99 ""pick 3""). As for the rest of the food-- I had the stuffed mushrooms at the recommendations of Yelpers, and was not disappointed, as well as the ""twisted BLT salad,"" which was... a salad... also not disappointing. Husband got a bacon cheeseburger. He commented that it felt like a pre-formed patty and wasn't impressed with that. The thin-cut fries were tasty. Calamari was kind of a disappointment. The quality of the calamari itself was very good (way to go, BJ's), but it was too greasy-- probably the oil wasn't hot enough-- enough that I was blotting pieces on a napkin before I ate them. Could have been the kitchen's mistake and not how they normally do it; if it hadn't been for that, it would have been pretty great, with a nice lemon aioli. Ambience is ""brewpub."" Overall it's better than some of the other brewpub options in the area. Service was pretty solid. They have a nice discounted movie ticket deal with the local theater. Location is excellent, in terms of PG county; the theater is right there, as is Climbzone (seriously, adults should try that place too-- it's super fun).

We decided to come here because of their promotion of buy one entrée, get one entrée free during lunch from 11 am to 3 pm. We asked our waitress right away if there was a way to use the deal for all of us. She said, ""We could have 2 separate checks so we could get 2 entrées free."" We were glad that we could do this. However, later when we got our bill, our waitress told us that we can only use the deal once per table even though she said we could make 2 separate checks so we can use the deal twice. We felt that we were misled. I would rather have them tell us that we cannot use the deal twice than telling us that we can and then when we already had finished eating tell us that we can't.  Now on to the food part! I got the buffalo bison burger, which was okay but the edges were too charred giving a very bitter aftertaste. The salad that came with it was not good, they should change the dressing that they use. I also got the chance of tasting the lemon thyme chicken and the toasted chicken pesto sandwich. They would have been good if they were not too salty. However, get the appetizer called the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It comes with yummy avocado egg rolls, chips with spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, and Santa Fe spring rolls. Everyone will be happy, especially when you cannot agree on what appetizers to get! How can I forget their scrumptious pizookies, which is a warm cookie contrasted with ice cream.

We tend to go around lunch/early dinner, and even before the nightly crowd, it gets pretty crowded. You can either sit at the bar, which is very colorful (to me), you can sit in the middle where you can hear the hustle and bustle from the televisions in the bar but still maintain somewhat of a conversation without being distracted, or you can sit on the opposite side of the bar, which is far away from the noise and you can actually listen to your fellow eating mates.  This is a nice restaurant, but there's nothing spectacular about it. To me, it's just a fancier replacement for the Greene Turtle (which closed a while ago).  I always order their jumbo meatballs and spaghetti. Pretty nice dish; they add hot crushed pepper in there for ya, and it comes with a nice fluffy and crunchy (good balanced) garlic bread.  Service is a hit or miss. Usually the waiters are good when it comes to serving their guests, but we had one (I know, it was JUST ONE) who 1.) got my dad's order wrong, and 2.) charged us twice for my dad's meal (once for the mistake and once for the correction).

We added 4 people to our party after we had been seated and they worked quickly to get us re seated and did not make us feel like it was an inconvenience (though my years working in a restaurant tell me otherwise ). The bathroom was super clean and it appeared that in the 2 hrs we were there it was freshened up. Even on a busy Friday night. The service was wonderful. And the food was delicious. With 12 people at a table we ate a variety of foods. I do regret that none of us saved room for dessert. I had the salmon with brown rice and veggies. The salmon was so flavorful, the veggies were lightly sautéed and the brown rice was surprisingly tasty. If you've ever made brown rice at home you know it isn't the most delightful grain without some help. There was also pizza that was very good. And my husband and coworker enjoyed their jambalaya.  And we had crispy calamari to get our meal started right. The kids had Chicken tenders and wings with fries. (I loved the fries). All in all it was a wonderful meal. And we are very glad there's a location so close.

Our food was out from the kitchen within a reasonable amount of time, but without the guacamole on the burger, which was promptly brought out after we brought it to their attention (We're easy to please). My burger was fantastic, it's so hard to find a chain restaurant that cooks a proper medium burger, but they nailed it.

The dough was cooked perfectly and not runny like some other pizza places that add a lot of toppings on their pizza. What won me over was how the bottom of the pan wasn't drenched in grease.

She was very short with us and told us there was a wait so we asked to speak with the manager. The manager came out and I explained the situation to him and he said they didn't take reservation and only call a heads and we had to wait anyway. Well, maybe you should train your staff to tell people that instead of writing names on pieces of receipt paper laying around or not even writing it down.

The server/hostess because that's who she was didn't have no social skills the thought just because she was young and smiled that we were suppose to roll over and ignore her tardiness and non management skills.  I finally ordered the root beer glaze wings and avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. I ended up getting the brisket burger as well. Please help me figure out why all came at the same time 35mins later to be exact.  We finally got a waitress she was awesome and kinda allowed my son to butter her up lol.

41,Aisha P.,"College Park, MD",61,101,136.0,3.0,2017-02-19,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon after a friend of mine chose this place to meet up. Our original place was vetoed because she was bringing her baby and the other place was too small and did not want to deal with the hassle. So, we came here and it was packed! The only table available at the time we arrived was a table right by a baby shower, which at the time, we thought we didn't mind. But, it may have been a bit much. I say all of this to say, that this may have impacted our inconsistent service.  Our server seemed new, or maybe he was overwhelmed. But, our service was patchy and slow. At times, he would come back quickly and other times, it would take him long periods of time before we even saw him and that was usually the times we needed something the most. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I ordered some calamari and wings. The calamari was average in taste, but chewy; and the wings were pretty good. I will likely get those if I ever come again.  I also ordered a pear cider and they brought me something totally different. When I realized it, they switched it out. It was weird that they made a big deal to come back and tell me they were taking the other drink off my bill. Uh, of course you are. You brought me the wrong drink and I only took 2 sips of it. Yes, that should be a given, not a perk. Also, my silverware was dirty, but the server took so long to come back after our food arrived, that I never got a chance to swap it out. Luckily, I didn't really need a fork. But, yeah, our server disappeared after we received our food and we had to flag him down to get a check and he took about 20+ minutes to come back to process our check. He did have some help as it seems the manager was walking around helping; the manager was actually the person who changed my drink and took my order.  So, in sum, it was an average experience. I like to think that service would have been better had it not been so packed and we weren't sitting next to a baby shower. However, I would have liked some more ""check in"" from staff. The food is average American restaurant fare, nothing spectacular. But, it is a nice, affordable spot to just stop in for an average meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=20,3.52,3.3,3.32,2.7,3.3880000000000003

I was sooo hungry and didn't want the hassle so I kept eating it, hoping it was just a bad scoop. But NOPE! The whole dish was hard and uncooked. I mentioned it to my server who brought me out cooked rice w/o the jambalaya sauce tho, wth. I didn't make a fuss or big deal at all. The manager ended up removing the dish from my bill. Thank God Bc that was horrible. Strangely, my SIL w the same dish had perfect jambalaya. Her meal was well cooked and even tasted different from mine, so weird. Still hungry, I ordered the mini Salted caramel pizookie for dessert, so good. I got the chicken alfredo pasta to go for my husband and that was also good.

I needed a few cubes of ice with each glass. I am pretty sure it was because the glasses were hot due to them being freshly cleaned (which is great) it was just bothersome to ask for ice with each glass. The mozzarella sticks serving size is great for the price however you can taste the flour in them more than the actual flavor. I ate them but I feel they could have been better. Lastly the service was a bit slow. We started out at the bar and service was great and fast but once we got seated at a table, the service slowed down. I would definitely go back, just wanted to share my thoughts of where I think the restaurant could use improving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel?start=20,3.2,3.23,3.26,,3.218
23,Lindsay L.,"Tewksbury, MA",81,1,1.0,1.0,2018-01-12,"Very disappointed. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger to go with no tomatoes, no mayo, no pickles and no mustard. Got something that barely looked like a mushed up patty with no cheese, but tomatoes, pickles, mayo and mustard smothering it. Pretty much everything I didn't ask for. Fries were cold. Just not very good. I took a picture of the sad looking patty after i managed to scrape all of the toppings I didn't want off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel,3.16,3.2,3.244,,3.1840000000000006
25,Lyndsay M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",85,1,,5.0,2018-01-13,"We had such a good time here!!! We did all small plates. Meatballs, lettuce wraps and spinach stuffed mushrooms. And the brussel sprout appetizer is not something you want to miss!!! Our service was excellent. Everyone was very nice to our children and we had a couple great draft beers from the brewery!!! I would visit again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel,3.24,3.2,3.244,,3.2160000000000006
24,M W.,"Washington, DC",6,33,3.0,2.0,2018-01-13,"Disappointing. My boyfriend and I ordered the Sirloin medium well. After cutting into it several times to check, we sent back to kitchen because the steak was medium rare. They recooked the same steak served to us. Typically, you'd get a fresh cut. That doesn't seem like sanitary practice for a restaurant. I mean what if I licked that steak? Now everybody that ordered steak after me will be chomping on my cooties or germs as my bf calls it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laurel,3.12,3.21,3.232,,3.174
