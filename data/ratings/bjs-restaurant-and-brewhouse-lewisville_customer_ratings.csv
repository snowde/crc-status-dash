178,Jeffrey C.,"Dallas, TX",2,36,,1.0,2012-02-04,Group lunch outing. Horrendous service. Extremely long wait for the food to arrive. The few times we saw our waitress she ignored requests for drink refills. As a group we decided we would avoid BJ's in the future.  Foodwise I can only comment on my dish of Tuscan Angelhair pasta that lacked any trace of the extra virgin olive oil listed on the menu.  It had a few small dices of roma tomato and odd little bits of feta that lacked any punch.

They've got a decent lunch menu that's actually managable to read. I had the mahi mahi fish tacos. They were superb. Good crunch and texture and the fish was nice and flaky.  The fish is served either blackened or fried. I opted for lower calories and went with the blackened fish. Place gets pretty packed during lunch but there's enough space here so it's a good spot for a power lunch and for under 10 bucks. Service is inconsistent and very slow at times. They sat us near the bathroom. It smells. Avoid sitting near the bathroom. Which is located straight ahead from the facade (i think). Overall, not a favorite but if you've got a picky crowd of guests this is the place to go because they've got entrees from burgers to pizza to salad to chicken tortilla soup. Oh and they also offer half soup and salad.

125,Sean R.,"Dallas, TX",42,367,2495.0,3.0,2012-07-29,I think that BJs have one of the best chicken wings in the market. It couples with some great pizza dishes that will fill 2 people up. Their beer menu is also extensive. I have always liked to go here when in Dallas and usually for quick lunch and at times dinner. The atmosphere is casual and sporty. BJs has several TV screens and will make a good destination to watch sports games while you are dining. The service here is also very good and normally very fast. The wait staff will check on the patrons from time to time and are quick about that. It is in line with several restaurants in its class along the I35 service road.

But I have recently had to cut the gluten out of my diet and finding restaurants with items that I can eat can be a challenge. so it is always a pleasure when a restaurant has special gluten free items to choose from other than the usual salad with no croutons, etc. I was so excited to have Pizza!!!! Yeah, Pizza on a gluten free crust. The crust was thin and had herbs infused in it. I had my three favorite toppings Mushrooms, onions and anchovies, along with cheese & sauce. It wasn't my favorite pizza from the Italian pizza place I've frequented in San Diego for 30 plus years, but it was darn good. They even have a gluten free pazzokie (cookie) but I am also not eating sugar otherwise this would have definitely tempted me.

217,Stephanie S.,"Denton, TX",0,20,,3.0,2013-02-22,"Ok...BJs is one of those balancing acts.  By far it is the BEST place for me and hubby to go with even our kiddo to have cocktails and apps.  Hubby loves the selection of beers, I love the martinis, and the kiddo loves the pizzcookie (or whatever it is) and root beer.  So we're all happy if we JUST stick to that...going in full-on for restaurant fare and exceptional service...prepare for disappointment.  The first time we went we did the cocktail app thing and were happy so the 2nd time we thought we'd take hubby's mom to eat and it was ok...service was slow, food took WAY to long especially with a 5 year old and half the time was spent reading the menu which I thought came from one of my graduate classes it was so freakin' long.  But, when the food finally did come out it was alright and everyone was happy.  So then we thought we would try it a 3rd time, this time with my mom.  Again, a menu that rivals any 600 page graduate course book, crappy service (she seemed like she just was too put out to do anything for us), slow bringing out the food, and the hostess at the front door...let's just say she's truly a blonde (no offense blondies).  I ordered the California Chicken sandwich...yuck.  First, my chicken still had the bones in it and it was grilled to a burnt crisp barely able to eat and the sourdough bread it was on (I'm not sure that's a great flavor profile anyway,especially when you pare it with avocado and peppers) was tough and greasy.  The chipotle mayo was missing its chipotle.  It just wasn't a very good sandwich.  Hubby had some jambalaya and he said it was ok with more cayenne pepper than jambalaya.  17 year old had Tuscon chicken limone, which he ate and said was ok...not sure what he thinks about anyways, so moving on.  My mom had a chicken stuffed baked potato and Cesar salad of which she said both were fine.  Kiddo had the pizzacookie thingy again as he ate before we left.  One annoyance is that there is no clear path in and out of the restaurant so you have to compete with those coming in while you are going out and as there is NO waiting area, you have to push your way out through a throng of people...not fun with a kiddo.  I'll just stick to the apps and cocktails as two restaurant experiences have left me less than thrilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=220,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0840000000000005,3.1200000000000006

She was no where to be found. Then the food took over 45 minutes to come out and my friend food was even later than that.

Took my order of a beer and appetizer - which was good and in happy hour pricing. I looked over the menu which goes on for pages and settled on the Mahi-Mahi tacos. However I finished my appetizer and beer in 10 minutes and waitress was still MIA during that period.  Manager asked the table nearby how things were but skipped over my table.  Then the busboy came by and I asked for table to be cleared. I wasn't chasing down the waitress to place my order after waiting a while. It wasn't that busy to me.

After 5 minutes our drink order was taken. A few minutes later drinks arrived. Drinks are great as usual. Service not so hot though , we ordered and she didn't take the menus, also I will add that we are at the smallest 2 person table. The guy dropping off the food also wasn't gonna take the menus , we had to ask. We also had to ask for silverware.  The happy hour flatbreads were very good. After the flatbreads were gone now the server and staff will not take our dirty plates and dirty glasses, we have no room on the table. We got up ourselves and handed our dirty plates to a passing food runner. Our waitress passed us many times without clearing our table.  Understanding that this is busy night we came in knowing that service might be slower than usual however, after noticeably seeing that multiple staff (ie. servers, bussers, food runners, and even management) have passed our table multiple times, it is crazy to me that a few simple things were not noticed after maybe 20 minutes. (Not to mention the many tables around us)  To summarize it all: If you come here, you can expect above par food however, expect for your dining experience to be double it's time and to feel pretty much forgotten. Not sure what's going on with this location, but they definitely need a heavy change over of staff.   I give this location two stars because I know that I can come to every BJs and expect to get the same quality of food, however if I could rate purely on service it would most definitely be a zero.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.1120000000000005,3.4800000000000004

Asked the server about the difference between the vegetarian pizza vs. the veggie prime. She said they were basically the same but in reality she did not know the difference. Ordered a large pizza, clam chowder in a bread bowl with Cesar salad, fried calamari and a side of fries. The calamari was soggy and soft. All the food except for the soup was mildly warm. Almost room temp. So in a couple of minutes they did become room temperature. Everything tasted good though but not fun to eat room temperature food.  So initially we were served the calamari. The rest of the food was brought to the table except for the fries. The server left the calamari plate. So we had all the food plus one of those drink menus at our table. There was very little room to eat at all. No biggie, I'll just tell the server to clear away some stuff. We also wanted Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper for our pizza. The problem was that our server did not come back to our table for the whole meal. So it was really uncomfortable to eat our cold food cause there was no room. Also we didn't have Parmesan cheese and red pepper so we could not eat our pizza the way we wanted to.  I was trying to look around for our server and couldn't find her. When I finally found her she was just talking to the other servers! I saw her talking for a couple of minutes then I lost track of her. When she came back I told her to cancel the fries, to get us boxes and the check.

It was really jumping for a Tuesday night and we had to wait in the bar for a table. The bar was packed, too. So, we snagged a couple of brews (they have Stone IPA on tap!) and waited. Soon the buzzer went off and we were seated. We were seated near the server station. Our server was right there, offering us drinks and an app; we commented that since we hadn't fully reviewed the menu, could he please come back in a few? Sure. Meanwhile, we perused the extensive menu and settled on an app. He took our app order and asked if we were ready to also order entrees. Since I don't much care for having apps and entrees delivered together, we asked if he could come back. He seemed a little annoyed. Once the app was delivered, we said we were ready to order. Giant got the Chinese chopped salad, and I ordered the Tavern Cut Pizza; I asked if I could add some items? Sure. I'd like to add Roasted Red Peppers. Red Pepper, he asked? Or Bell Peppers? Roasted Red Bell Peppers, I repeated, knowing they are on the menu. Also, green olives. OK, he said and off he went. Short time later, he delivered the Giant's salad, and my pizza with green bell peppers and kalamata olives.  The food was good; pizza had a nice thin crisp crust and the Giant appeared to enjoy his salad.  Now, I'm tired. I've been traveling and up since before dawn, so when server came by to ask how everything was, I didn't lie, but I didn't complain, either. Just ordered another beer. Through all of this, the server appeared a little annoyed. Not sure why; he seemed to be having a great time congregating at the server station with his buds.

28,Brady L.,"Denton, TX",36,15,1.0,2.0,2016-09-22,"On Thursday, September 22nd, two of my co-workers and I decided to eat at BJ's for lunch. When we entered the establishment, it was about half-filled with patrons, and we were promptly greeted and sat by a smiling and personable host. Unfortunately, this concluded our positive experience.  Upon being seated, we were informed our waitress would be Heather, and that she would be with us shortly. At least ten minutes had passed before being acknowledged again, even though our supposed waitress passed by our table countless times. A gentleman reluctantly approached our table, informed us that Heather was a little tied up, and that he would be taking our drink order. We ordered our drinks and he brought them out to us promptly, reassuring us Heather would be with us soon to take our food order. Another ten minutes passes and no signs of Heather, aside from her passing by to tend to her large 10-14 person table; it seems to have monopolized all of her attention. The original gentleman who took our drink order was bussing and cleaning the table behind us when he rhetorically asked if Heather had taken our food order. Frustrated, we laughed, told him no, and he once again tended to us, albeit reluctantly.  Within a reasonable amount of time, a food runner brought us our entrees. The food was delicious. Everything was fresh, hot, and tasty. In the midst of dining and near finishing, Heather finally made her grand entrance; she inexplicably brought us three small plates, all of which remained untouched. No introduction, no apology, no ""can I get you guys anything else,"" or ""how is everything?"" Three. Plates. POOF! Back into non-existence, as far as we were concerned.  We finish our meals (again, to reiterate, the food was delectable), and begin the waiting game for our checks. The gentleman who took all of our orders asked if we needed anything else, to which one of my friends requested another root beer. He responded by telling him he would let Heather know. He pretty much knew he wasn't going to see that refill.  Much to my amazement, here comes Heather, two root beers in hand! They would've been much more enjoyable had they been brought out while we were eating, but alas, it simply wasn't in the cards with Heather's vacuous (at best) attentiveness. When she dropped the drinks off, she gathered our empty plates, and made her exit. Still, not a single word.  At this point, she returned to our table with checks in hand (quickly too! ""TIP TIME!"" PSSSHHHH!). We opened our checks, and what do you know? She managed to mess that up! She split an appetizer evenly amongst the three of us, even though only one person ate it. She walked off to rectify the issue, but turned around after realizing she had no idea who had what entrée; hard to discern when you've had absolutely no involvement.  She returned with corrected checks, and had even removed the cost of our drinks in what I assume was a feeble attempt to make up for her dismal service. We paid, left a deserving $0 tip, and concluded our visit.  In conclusion, my experience at BJ's has always been fantastic on all fronts: food, service, and environment. Unfortunately, Heather's HORRENDOUS service has left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. I doubt I, or the other two gentlemen I was in the company of, will be returning any time soon. Bravo to the chef, host, and other wait staff who picked up Heather's slack. Heather, maybe look into another career choice, because attitude and customer service are lacking.

Came here with a large party (12 people) during lunch and made reservations beforehand and the table was ready well in time so kudos to their preparation. They have a wide array of beer selections, so I suggest giving the drinks menu a look! They have a bar, large style sitting areas and one on one sitting areas so this place is perfect for almost any time of the day! This place was not super crowded during lunch there was a steady flow of people coming in and out and the restaurant definitely had enough seating (i.e. No wait time).  I recommend their deep dish pizzas the crust is very soft and the sauces perfectly complement each other. The most popular ones I've been told are buffalo chicken, chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken! The only thing is their chicken falls off the pizza a lot and it looks like the chicken was added on after it baked. Nonetheless, the pizza was still great! You can also do a half and half pizza as well. You can easily split a medium with a friend if you're hungry or a small if you guys aren't that hungry. Pizzas came in about 15 minutes from ordering so definitely can be a stop for lunch if you have an hour! Pizookies are an absolute must if you're a first timer. Perfectly baked cookie with ice cream.

We called Bj's prior to heading to the hospital to let them know that I had gotten food poisoning from eating their tainted jambalaya, just wanted to give them a heads up. Didn't want anyone else going through what I experiencing at that moment! They were uncaring! The manager took my number down and said someone would call back. They turned my number over to their headquarters Risk management department. After 3 months, BJ's determined that they were not the cause for my food poisoning. Not sure how they came to that conclusion since my husband and I had eaten the same things over the previous days except that one meal and I can assure it was jambalaya rapidly escaping my body! We never asked for money, just wanted them to be aware! They just don't care! STAY AWAY or really.... Eat at your own risk!! We won't EVER be returning to this BJ's or any of them for that matter!!

We got seated immediately, however, we waited for about 20min with server after server passing us by (and no drinks at the table so we clearly haven't been helped) before I finally got up and went to the host stand in which they found someone to take over our table immediately. The 4 of us eventually ordered our drinks (a couple beers) and then a variety of food off the menu. 10-15 minutes after, still no beers but here come the food runners with our food, and boy am I thankful for the food runners so our food didn't get the lack of attention like everything else seemed to that evening.

I've sworn this place off a few times only to go back. I've reached out to management about this multiple times. We're given a $20 gift card instead of having our meal comped (Which I guess is nice, however, it forces us to go back to use it). It's not even worth calling anymore when something is so far below standard.  If you're going to eat here, make sure you dine in. Most of the time I've had a good experience.

I heard about the new slow-roasted menu and wanted to try one of the items. Although it looked appealing, the prime rib would have been too much food with the addition of the soup or salad. The Double Bone-In Pork Chop did not come with an appetizer, so I chose that. I chose the rice pilaf and white cheddar mashed potatoes as my sides. The pork chop tasted great especially with the rub. It was neither over- nor undercooked. Before the first bite, I was a bit hesitant because there was no sauce or gravy. The rub made them unnecessary. As for the sides, I enjoyed the rice pilaf. I could have done without the mashed potatoes. Only if I had known there were more sides available. Unfortunately, the menu is designed terribly. The only sides listed on Page 1 were the standard ""Signature Sides"". Page 9 had both the standard sides and the ""Premium Sides"", such as, honey sriracha Brussels sprouts, turmeric-roasted cauliflower, Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, etc. I was correct in ordering the pork chop. As I barely touched the mashed potatoes, I had room for dessert. For a chocoholic, there was only one option... Triple Chocolate Made With Ghirardelli pizookie. Unlike other pan cookie desserts, this one was not too thick. As a result, with the two scoops of double chocolate chip ice cream, it was the right amount of dessert for one. Although, it did come with two spoons. Although there were plenty of tables, I decided to sit at the bar today. There were a few folks behind the bar and always someone within earshot. As a result, I never had problems getting service. I would have posted this review when I was still at the restaurant. At the time, their free wifi was useless.

Very refreshing. Get it on a hot day and you're set.  2. I end up getting the bone in pork chop. Absolute fantastic deal for the portion. They only serve the pork chop after 4PM!Comes with two sides. First side I chose was the chicken tortilla soup. Very delicious. I love that they add the avocado!  3. Pork Chop was decent. Not the best but still pretty good. This was mediocracy at its finest.
