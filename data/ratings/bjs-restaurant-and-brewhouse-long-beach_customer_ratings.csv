25,Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26.0,3.0,2012-03-16,"Like i said with most of the restaurant franchises on 2nd Street the BJ's here is pretty small. They have all the same food and beer that you would find at any other BJ's, but just really compact. I can only imagine when this place gets busy, where do people wait to be seated, usually they would probably hang outside the place.  But the hand full of times I've been to this place they weren't really that busy. There would be at least 3 more tables instead of us in the restaurant. Like every other restaurant I try and see if they have Jambalaya on the menu, and BJ's does have a pretty good Jambalaya. I was craving a burger this time so I tried the Jalapeno Burger. It usually comes with red onions, fried jalapenos, jack cheese lettuce and tomatoes. I added sauteed mushrooms to my burger and got it with thin cut fries. The fries were surprisingly really good. If they can make the fries into truffle cheese fries than BJ's would have it all! There are TVs around but if you don't sit on a certain spot you will be squinting to see the TV. Other than that give this place a try and don't be discouraged on the small capacity of the place. It's Long Beach by the way so if you don't want BJ's you can always go someplace else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.7960000000000003,2.92

WTF! you would think for $10 they would give you a good salad but NO... i would have been more satsified with a salad from jack in the box.. im so dissapointed in this bjs... they are usually known for their good portions and customer service.. i guess not this one :'(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.472,3.0800000000000005

I usually stick to the pizza or maybe a burger.  This BJ's location is a smaller sized one, as it is off of 2nd street. It also has a smaller sized menu (thank you) for those with indecisive minds.  The time I came here I shared buffalo chicken pizza and boneless hot wings with my boyfriend. Hot wings were a little spicy, and the pizza was on point served with requested ranch & blue cheese on the side.

It's never really too busy in here, which I guess can be a good thing but I hate eating in a place where it's just me and a few other tables.

Came here with some coworkers for lunch and they have lots of choices like 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad ($7.50).  I ordered the mini sausage pizza with a Caesar side salad ($6.50)  Although the salads came out pretty quickly, the entrees took awhile, which is not good when you're on a lunch break from work.  There were hardly any other guests in the restaurant, so I'm not sure what the hold up was.  If they could get food out more quickly, they may be able to get some additional lunch business?  At least we had a great server who kept our drinks refilled and the food was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach,3.16,2.86,2.86,2.604,2.9800000000000004

72,Taylor S.,"Long Beach, CA",6,8,1.0,2.0,2012-08-07,"I've lived just around the corner from this place for almost all my life and in that time I've come to realize a couple of things. 1. They service is HORRIBLE, or at least that has been my experience with it over the years and from multiple different servers. Once I went there with some friends and family for lunch, and there was no one else in the restaurant. We placed our order and waited and waited, after 40 minutes we asked were our food was and if we could please get some drinks. They had completely forgotten about us and are order. That is pretty hard to do when there is no one else to distract you and the only people there is a table of 8. My most recent encounter with the incompetent staff was just tonight, I called to order a pizza (one that could not be placed online since it was a special order 50/50) and they put me on hold, only to forget that I was on the line. I waited 5 minutes and called again, same guy answered and seemed shocked that I would call back and was confused. He said ""Wait., you actually want to order that? Didn't you already place your order?"" I told him how he forgot I was on hold and he said ""I won't forget about you this time."" Well he was a horrible liar because again I found myself on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up and now I'm not even hungry. 2. The food is okay, you have to know what to order. Stick to the pizza. If it sounds like something you would get at CPK then avoid it because it is a failed attempt. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza with no celery. 3. It is severely overpriced. $20 or more just for a medium pizza. I only paid it once in a while because I am super hungry and don't want to waste my money on Domino's (eek.)  If you like deep dish pizza and can order online for take out, go for it. Otherwise you are best off going to California Pizza Kitchen on PCH and 2nd, which is a personal favorite of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=60,3.08,2.81,2.81,2.44,2.918

63,Yelp R.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,1.0,1.0,2012-10-06,"Triple jeopardy experience! Ageism, Classism, and Racism all in one at the BJ's on 2nd Street!  1. Even if you are over 18 years of age, you will be referred to as a boy or a girl by the manager. 2. You need 3/4 of your party to arrive on the dot in order to keep your RESERVED table. Why? Because traffic stops and parking spaces open for all BJ's customers in order for them all to be there on time for their reservation. If anyone from your party were to arrive later than ""on the dot,"" they will first be denied to order and then asked to leave your table by the manager (and rudely, if you are a minority) to go wait in line for another table because their part of the table will be taken away. And, this splitting of your party only happens if you're lucky and they feel like being generous. If not, they take away your whole table and thus, your RESERVATION. Now, all the people of your party who have arrived will have to wait until everyone arrives in order to wait in line to get a table even though you made a RESERVATION. 3. You have a limit of 2 hours for your party to be there eating at your reserved table but if they feel like kicking you out at least 30 minutes before your ""time is up,"" even if you're a paying customer, and you have a full table, not everyone at your party will get to eat because the manager says so. 4.

Since this restaurant is a LOT smaller, it doesn't have that same feel as another BJs might. The lighting was very bright and kitchen-like and there was hardly any music or background noise. Awkward, really.  I came in and there was a 15 minute wait but there were many tables available. I was told that there was a party of 43 coming in. We ordered a beer and a cider. My cider was not filled to the brim, rather, just a little over half. I didn't say anything since I don't drink much, but my boyfriend was peeved.  He ordered a spicy jalapeno cheeseburger and I got The Great White which is a usual favorite at BJs. My boyfriend's fries came out first, which was weird. The waitress said ""Here's your side order of fries,"" which confused us because we did not order a side. The waiter who took our order came back later and apologized and said it was a part of the meal and he wasn't sure why they were sent out so early. By then, the seasoned fries were lukewarm because we weren't sure if we should eat it or not. The Great White was a disappointment. I asked for Spinach in the pizza, but really they just dumped it on top and it was burnt. Not happy about that. Then the edges of the pizza were burnt black as well (I've got pictures to prove it, hah) and overall the taste was mediocre. I've had just better where the pizza was the perfect temperature and the crust was crunchy and moist.  Definitely will NOT be here again and would NOT recommend it to others.

Despite the disappointment, we decided to tell the hostess that we would like a table by the window for some light.  It took forever for our waitress to come back so we can order.  I'd say 15 minutes.  We had to flag her down.  My girlfriend and I got the endless soup and salad with drinks.  My sister got the flatbread and a garden salad.  We also ordered some Santa Fe spring rolls to share.  By that point, the A/C finally came in and were were no longer dying from heat, just dying from waiting.  They did not bring all our food out at once. My food came out first, then my girlfriend, then it took another 10 minutes for my sisters flatbread. Her salad didn't come until another 10 minutes when the waitress finally realize she forgot it.  My girlfriend had ordered a lemonade.  She had drank it half way and the dumb waitress came to refill it.   She ended up pouring water instead into her cup.  On the way to refill the wrong drink, she also spilled into our table.  As for the food, it was crap.  It was made differently here.  For example, normally my sisters flatbread and salad would come on the same plate at other locations. Hers didn't and was extremely small. It looked like a snack.  A couple of lettuce sprinkled on a plate and two piece of flatbread.  My tortilla soup was extremely salty.  I felt like I was eating salt.  The Caesar salad was bland.  Oh and the appetizer, the Santa Fe spring rolls came out last.  That was the only thing that was okay.

I'm not one to complain about slow service unless it's reeeaaally slow. Let me preface this with there were three other tables in the restaurant. We waited the host stand a few minutes for a hostess to show up and seat us. Then we waited several minutes to even be greeted, another two or three for waters. By the time our water came out we were ready to order. Fried artichokes and two salads (yea the grease kind of negates the greens, I know), and a drink for each of us. Apps come out, drinks come out, all ok. Not great but not awful. Then we wait.  And wait some more.  And wait a little bit more.  I used the restroom and came back to my friend telling me the waitress forgot to put our food in. Suddenly 35 minute salads made sense. We finally get our salads, which were ok. We both agreed neither had enough meat. I wouldn't call it even close to 4 oz.  We ordered pizookies for desert and as we are waiting another girl comes over to let us know our waitress has left for the day. Hmm. Maybe she thought we wouldn't tip cause we are young but we are both in the industry and would've still left a decent tip despite her slow service. Not her fault the food sucked. Either way I was annoyed she didn't come over and do the typical hand-off speech, just left. We ate the pizookies which were the best part of the meal, and flagged down our new waitress for the bill.

A/C was not on but they were happy to turn it on for us...(were we really the only ones in the vicinity looking to escape the 85 degree weather?) Service was swift and friendly and our food was really good.  I had a parmesan crusted chicken with cheesy potatoes that was served hot and was very tasty. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fish and chips and my sons each had a mac & cheese starter that they devoured (came with garlic bread of all things!!! - is this where Domino's got that crazy, heinous pasta bread bowl idea??) and they shared a thin crust pepperoni pizza which everyone at the table sampled and enjoyed. I had 2 very good glasses of chardonnay, the rest had soft drinks and the bill was still under $85, excluding a well-earned 25% tip. Here's what could have made it better: Cleaning supplies!!  Cleaning regimen!! Tables, chairs and menus need a thorough cleaning! It was confusing to watch a staffer dusting frames on the wall by the bathroom when the areas where people sit and touch needed some good old-fashioned soap and water. A good vacuuming wouldn't hurt either! I would go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=20,2.52,2.8,2.8,,2.688

The variety of food is perfect without overdoing it. I can't complain about the food, because I can't ever remember having a bad meal. Tonight, I went with three other people. We got there at the same time as everyone else... so, there was a little bit of a wait. But it was pretty quick getting a table. We ordered many things... a beer, waters, avocado egg rolls, a wedge salad, tortilla soup, shrimp scampi, ahi poke, a house salad, and a chocolate chip pazookie. No complaints as far as food goes! I love finishing dinner up with dessert... and you can't go wrong with a pazookie. Mmmmm... I took away one star, because the service was ""meh..."" It was the bare minimum this evening, but it didn't ruin the whole dinner for us as everything was brought out in a timely manner and drinks were refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach,2.64,2.82,2.82,,2.748

No one came buy to get us our drinks, no hello my name is ______ I'll be your server tonight, no one said s*%^! We left. Awful.

42,Michelle G.,"Long Beach, CA",19,24,1.0,2.0,2014-06-26,They don't have vodka and ran out of cider during my visit. It's also significantly smaller than other BJ's Restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=40,2.48,2.8,2.8,,2.672
