36,Jonah R.,"Longview, TX",1,5,,5.0,2015-11-14,Great food and service. So glad to have a BJ's Brewhouse in Longview.  Very personable GM and staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=20,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
9,Darris J.,"Humble, TX",16,332,14.0,3.0,2015-11-17,"I was informed this was day 2 of operation of this place. With that in mind the bar itself did okay. The waitstaff appear lost, but I'm sure after a couple of weeks they'll be at full speed. My calamari app was over cooked and a little greasy but, it's Longview, Tx so it'll do.  Poor whiskey and bourbon selection but a decent variety of beer on tap. For the area this should be a hot spot for years to come. Since there are dark napkins many people will associate it ""classy"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
42,David M.,"Longview, TX",3,16,2.0,3.0,2015-11-21,Complete chaos! Waitstaff running around In clusters and tripping over each other. We tried to orient ourselves to the huge menu but felt rushed by the waitstaff. They were training for about a week but still seemed lost and confused about the simplest question. Also the advertised happy hour discounts that were advertised in the menu were unknown to our waitress and when questioned she said she would find out but when I pointed it out in the menu she still acted like she didn't understand. Our bill also didn't reflect the discounts. My ultimate spaghetti and meatballs was warm outside and cold inside. My daughters baked ravioli was good and so was my wife's southern fried chicken. I am confused what this place is trying to be since there are so many selections that other than the craft beer everything else is mediocre. The prices are pretty high for what you get at 14.95 for spaghetti and meatballs I could get a better deal at Olive Garden or pizza king and get a salad to boot but here it's 3.50 extra? If your a beer connoisseur this is probably the place for you but save your money and eat somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=40,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

A little glitch in our order was quickly and graciously resolved. They even gave us a complimentary pazookie.

31,Rebecca C.,"Longview, TX",64,48,31.0,5.0,2015-12-11,"We ate here last night and it was amazing!! I had the guacamole burger and it was absolutely delicious! The fries were nice and crispy! We loved almost everything, well except the home brewed orange cream soda it was sooo sweet and really really flat. Service was exceptional we did have a 20min wait but that's kind of expected with a brand new place.  We will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=20,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
18,Jackie M.,"Henderson, TX",56,167,80.0,1.0,2015-12-16,"So I do know this is a new restaurant, how ever I also know they flew in staff from other locations to train the new employees. So to me they have no excuse.  First two trips were my husband And dad both got raw burgers basically when asking for well done and took for ever for drinks.  So the 3rd trip we went and it took a while but we gave them the benefit of the doubt. I asked for a burger that was well done no pink. My husband ordered a burger medium we both got burgers and mine has medium well. I ate it and thought next time I'll know to say no pink at all. The frys were great and drinks were watery and we had to ask for refills.  Next trip tonight we go in at  9:30 it is 10:40 we just left after our meal arrived. No we didn't eat it either.  So here's the play by play we went in got sat ordered drinks came fairly decently but my husband had to ask for lemon to mask the taste of unsweetened tea even tho he asked for sweet. We ordered a burger well done  no pink at all. I even made a joke about wanting it a little burnt to insure no pink. And he ordered a chicken fried steak w a piece or garlic bread.  So litterly an hour later we get our food. My husband laughed at the fact that their was two tea spoons max of gravy on his giant steak....so he asked waitress to bring more and his roll. She said sure I'll take care of it. So as she turned around two more employees walked up basically on top of our table telling her she could have all the rest of the tables. Keep in mind not busy. But still she can't take care of the few she has.....either way I don't think standing next to our table was the place to discuss it.   So she heads off. Please know we had yet after the hour to see lemon or a fresh tea for my husband.  Then we sit and watch her go off and do other things. Then while waiting my husband tells me to cut the burger. I did and bright and shiny red is all I see....I'm mad at my self for not taking a picture because it was so red I couldn't have ate it.  We waited to tell her but she just wasn't coming back anytime soon. So we got up told the hosts what happened and they wanted us to speak to a manager. Personally I was to pissed to stay and discuss with the manager.  Yes I know that the cooks are responsible for the bad cooking but the waitress is also at fault for not checking in or paying attention to anything. Or remembering anything!!!! I know how hard it is to keep everything straight but please realize your entire job is to pay attention to your tables!!!  So take my review for what it is I hope this is not a common thing because I don't want others to go through all of this as well.  Also side note. I had researched the menu because they have gluten free menu which my mother has celiac. So I check things out because this is a very very critical thing to deal with when coming to food. So after all these issues I would never feel safe taking my mom to this restaurant having food allergies. They are not trust worthy with any allergies! Please please allergie aware customers BEWARE!!! So thanks whataburger for feeding me!  Spoke to Colten the manager he apologized but the hosts didn't tell him entire story just that burger wasn't cooked. He made a few excuses and tried to save face but after 4 tries and  that much money on raw burgers no thanks! Total of 5 pink burgers when asked for all well done. He also explained that the bad waitresses would eventually be weeded out by not making money... Uh fire them before they turn away customers!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002
17,Roy S.,"San Clemente, CA",3,4,9.0,1.0,2015-12-17,"My wife and 2 kids have been here 3 times since it opened a month or so ago. The service the first time was good. The second time we ordered bottled beer and it took at least 15 minutes to get that out to the table. This wasn't a beer they had to get from the tap, you just take the beer out of the fridge and bring a glass and drop it off, I'll do the rest. A little upsetting... Last night, I went there and ordered the same two bottled beers and got my food and was halfway done eating by the time we got our beers. When we did get the drinks the server didn't have a way to open the bottle so he had to take them back to the bar and then it took a solid 15 more minutes to get them back. When we were done eating we got our beers! Incredibly we were told that they lost track of the bar orders.  I have been to this restaurant in many states and towns and this is by far the worst run out of them all. Hopefully they get a better manager and training program here or I'm going to keep frequenting Cheddars which is by far better in the customer service department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000008
48,Dan G.,"Daingerfield, TX",1,4,1.0,1.0,2015-12-23,We got here and went to check in. The young man at the front desk was terribly rude and arrogant. The wait was terribly long - much longer than we were told. Then the service was slow. The server had no clue what the drinks were that were ordered and we had to show her the food items on the menu because she didn't know what we were ordering. The drinks took about 15 minutes. I'm still waiting for the meal and so have plenty of time to write this and perhaps read a book. Later this evening I guess I'll find out how the food is. Probably doesn't matter as I'll never be back. The manager was running around trying to calm irate customers down. He wasn't doing a good job. Let me encourage you to go somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=40,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003
20,Pranati R.,"Austin, TX",299,99,71.0,4.0,2015-12-26,"A BJ's opening in our neck of the woods was honestly the best news I could get! Pizookies are the best thing to happen since sliced bread and no one does skillet cookie goodness quite like BJ's and trust me I've tried at home many-a-times with no such success, so I'm just a slave to their pizookie. I've been to BJ's in the Bay Area several times but it was always for their beers and pizookies but I finally tried their deep dish pizza - the Great White. It was made very well, mushrooms and tomatoes cooked down perfectly to retain texture and flavor! If you're here I recommend the beer and cider sampler since that's what I always used to get, and try literally any pizookie - but the triple chocolate is my favorite! My friend also got calamari when she came with me and it was pretty good! The sauce was ranch-based so there's very little you can do wrong with a ranch sauce! Since this place is new I have had very hit or miss experiences here but overall, pretty friendly and nice!  PROTIP - if you like the place, download their app and join their loyalty program! It's totally worth it :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=20,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
19,Kaitlyn W.,"Longview, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-12-28,"terrible terrible terrible service. My family & I went around 1 in the afternoon (fairly busy) & didn't leave until the restaurant until 3. Our waitress was very disorganized. We ordered drinks & then she forgot go write them down & asked us again what we ordered. I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger (comes with bacon & cheese)... I received the burger & it had no bacon or cheese, just meat & bun with a little mustard. We confronted the waitress & she replied in a very ignorant way. She said ""uhhh no i don't think it has anything on it""...what restaurant would serve a burger with nothing on it on the adults menu?!

35,Phil F.,"White Oak, TX",1,27,1.0,4.0,2015-12-31,"I have been twice now. Serivice was good both times and food was very good. I see reviews that are awful for this new restaurant, which is pretty common for a new chain restaurant in their early months. Trashing them doesn't make them better, working with them does. The beer is great and consistent, the food good. The rest will get better. It annoys me when people who have never worked in a service industry want to be so demanding.

50,Christina F.,"Binghamton, NY",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-02,"Well. What an eventful night for my boyfriend's birthday. We wanted Thai food, but they weren't open, so we went to BJ's instead. We sat at the bar because it was crazy packed. Ordered an appetizer and our meals. All of a sudden, our meals were walking toward us, but the waitress delivered them to us from behind us in the busy aisle between the bar and the high-top tables behind. As the waitress was delivering my chicken pitas, someone bumped into her, she slipped on the floor, and dumped the entire plate into my lap, breaking the plate on my chair (or the bar, I couldn't tell which). It wasn't the waitress' fault, the manager checked on me to make sure I wasn't cut from the broken plate and they comped my tacos. But that's it. That's all they comped. I was cool about the whole thing too - I didn't yell, I didn't blame them for the incident - I accepted their apologies, drank my beer and paid the bill. I just can't believe they only comped my food and the manager was only concerned if I was cut by the broken plate. What would have had to happen for them to comp at least the appetizer also, which I might add came out *after* our meals? Getting cut by the plate also? I am disappointed by the whole incident. I won't be going back voluntarily in the future. Hey BJ's. You lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=40,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004
49,Mike F.,"Longview, TX",19,55,1.0,3.0,2016-01-09,"My wife and I drive by here a couple of times a week and finally decided to stop and eat there. I have seen very few reviews that were so mixed, several 1 star to a few 5 star. To me a good restaurant is consistency  This one hasn't reached that point yet, maybe being new is the cause. The first thing the waitress offered us was one of their 42 beers on tap. We are in our late 60's and shouldn't look like serious beer drinkers (for lunch). I guess that is their major push because they run from $7 to $10 a beer and are probably a good profit maker for them. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and we have no complaints with the serviced. The food, however, was just average. Not bad and not good. My wife had a soup and sandwich and I had a lime chicken breast on rice. Her sandwich was the best of all. Mine did not have a lot of flavor. Just average for a $10 lunch, quality and quantity. Summary: The place is OK but nothing to brag about. They have a lot of competition that is as good or better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=40,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

It was a Thursday night and I realize its's busy, but dont offer a call ahead. The food was absolutely delicious but took two tries for my friend. The staff was very apologetic, though. The beers were a bit too pricey but the selection was ok.  The cocktails are all supposedly ""top shelf"" but were concoctions of top liquor with cheap, overpoured mixer. It just ruined the quality of the alcohol and at the price, they should be on point. I would do take out on the food, but I'll just go to Harley's for a $9 build your own 6 pk. Service was great, though. We had a knowledgeable waitress who gave great food recommendations! At least we can say we tried it out.

14,JG M.,"Marshall, TX",2,127,755.0,3.0,2016-04-03,"Longview needed a good place like this. Doesn't seem that way with all the restaurants around but this is good food a step up from Chile's or Applebee's.  JG score from us of 4.5/10 (+1.5 for food, +1 for atmosphere, 0 for price, +1 for Diet Dr Pepper, 0 for typical service and +1 for we would return) Large menu with many choices. We have each eaten at these separately in DFW but this is out 1st time here. We got the Chicken Pot Stickers as an appetizer since those and Fried Pickle spears are our favorites and these were good here. We brought a guest along as well, Olivia. She got the California Club which she said was good and J and I got small pizzas each so we could split and try them. We had the Gourmet 5 Meat Pizza and the Mediterranean Pizza. Both were good pizzas but we liked the meat much more. The food here gets a one and a half on our scale for being good but not being unforgettable.....even the other entrees we have tried at other BJ's.  Atmosphere is good here. Nice and clean and fun to look all around and even many TV's to watch. This is a busy place with a lot of people but not too cramped and the seating is comfortable. Price is over $15 for a good meal but that would seem appropriate here.  They do have Diet Dr Pepper and some brewed Root Beer and are known for a cream soda too. The service was friendly and typical. We will come back someday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

26,Megan L.,"Longview, TX",0,7,,2.0,2016-08-11,"We have been a few times now- for a dinner date, for lunch and dinner with our kids. It's always just okay. I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants to begin with, so you have to do a lot to impress me. I am definitely not impressed by overpriced, mass-produced food. The first time we shared a pizza and an order of tacos. They were good but nothing to write home about. I asked for a side of pizza sauce because the pizza seemed dry, and the waitress acted like that was weird. I don't really care what the cooking process involves- the pizza was dry.  On the second visit I had the jambalaya, and my husband had one of the lighter fish choices over couscous. Mine was very good. His was just okay and not really that flavorful. The kids shared a kids pizza. (Our youngest is not a big eater.) With a BOGO coupon on our two entrees, water to drink, one kids meal, and a kids pazookie, our bill was still over $30 after tip. For lunch. That is just nuts. The most recent visit was a Monday night with the kids. Somehow they were out of large pizzas so ours came out as two smalls. No biggie. But they took about 40 minutes, and they were barely warm. The cheese wasn't even fully melted. We also ordered a burger to share and had to send that back because it didn't have all the toppings. There were obviously kitchen issues. Our server, Celeste, handled things beautifully, but she just couldn't fully compensate for the BOH shortcomings. The wait is usually pretty long, the service is friendly and decent, and the food, while good, is just not that impressive or even consistent to me for the prices. I couldn't stomach a full-price bill at this place. I would rather spend my dollars with a local restaurant or just cook at home. Either way, the food is better and usually more affordable anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-longview?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

Everyone's order came out 25 min later with our drinks. I was now out of time so I asked the waitress to bring me a togo box. When I finally realized she was not returning to our table, I decided I had enough time to scarf my food down and speed to work.  I ordered the Fish Tacos. The tacos were so cold, they had obviously been ready to serve for a while. The fires were cooked in old oil that had been used to cook fish. I had never tasted fishy fries before and have no intention to again.  This has got to be the worst dining experience I have every had.

Slider burgers were burnt tasting, though they were pink inside, not to mention the onions were burnt to a crisp with no flavor. I think they tried to save their sorry sliders by drowning them in ketchup, definitely did not help. Ketchup,ketchup, ketchup. Have you ever gone swimming in a pool of ketchup? just go to BJ's!   Fries were too salty, I've had fries better than that at a drive through! Come on BJ's! Step it up. Calamari... boring, soggy, and rubbery.It should be crispy. Try trulucks... you will never forget what good calamari is! And it is definitely not BJ's We got the pizcookie dessert, and it was mini mini, it was Like it was made for a baby, not only was it the size for a baby, but a baby could eat it too!
