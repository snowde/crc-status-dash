277,Shant T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,23,7.0,2.0,2012-01-03,"Roaming the streets of the Century City mall one afternoon, I got the urge to indulge in a rich and heavy lunch. When I get this urge, I like to really make it count, so it's not an easy decision. However, I was quite hungry so time was of the essence. I settled on BJ's because (1) I'd briefly walked into this location once before and was actually taken back by how nice it was for a BJ's - it's a new location, (2) I'm a sucker for a good beer list, and I remembered seeing at least 30 beers on tap, and (3) I thought a good deep dish would hit the spot. Okay, it's nothing too special today, but BJ's it is. Atmosphere: Clean, modern, and lively. Plenty of tvs around the bar. Nice outdoor dining facing Constellation Blvd.  Beer: I'm ballparking this, but at least 30 beers on tap, ranging from 8-10 BJ brews to your typical imports to seasonal craft beers. Not the most unique brews, but still, it holds its own, especially for a chain. I had 2 pints, and apparently they're $3 during lunch time... boom! Service: Corporate chain. Very good. Food: I hadn't viewed a BJs menu in quite some time, but it's approaching Cheesecake Factory status (fyi - i like CF)... geezuz, so many pages! Similar format too. I dont know, maybe it's the same company. Going back to the ""rich and heavy"" theme, I ordered a small pepperoni/meatball. I don't generally prefer deep dish, but I've had some damn good deep dish before. Gotta say though, not a fan of BJ's version: 95%  fluffy dough / 5% toppings, cheese, and sauce. What is that?? I mean, if they served that as actual bread, it would be fine, but your signature pizza?... no! I get the feeling a lot of the items on the menu would be just okay. Not terrible, but nothing special...  At the end of the day, I felt like I wasted an opportunity of indulgence. Disappointment sets in.

You know I'm not one for turning down free meals but this time I was in a hurry to eat and get back. Of course I had low expectations given that we had a party of 20. The server was nice and did a decent job accommodating everyone's needs and taking orders.  We had two large tables and each table started with a ""Best Beginnings"" platter. It was definitely the best part of the entire meal.  After waiting another 25 minutes, we got our entrees. That was pretty fast considering the size of our group. Too bad my entree was terrible.  I got the ""New"" $5.95 Chicken Quesadilla lunch special.  I don't even know why I ordered a cheap entree since the meal was FREE to me anyway.  It was the worst quesadilla I've ever had. The tortillas they used are probably not even tortillas.  The thing was as hard as a brick.  I opted out on the beans and asked for some rice instead. The rice was not appetizing at all.

After debating where to go, my friend and I decided to have lunch here.  I ordered the sandwich and soup combo.  When my lunch arrived it was HUGE.  It included the following and their description: Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich: Threw out the 1 piece of bacon and enjoyed it.  It inluded roasted turkey breast, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, dijon mayo, and blue cheese dressing.  I did not taste the avocado, which was good for me.  There was plenty of turkey inside and the bread was very thick.  Bread was good to tear and dip with my tomato soup. Tomato Basil Bisque- Some oil floating on top but very delicious and creamy.  It was very flavorful and I definitely recommend.  Their cup was pretty big for a cup. Wedge Fries- You get to choose between wedge or crispy.  The wedges were too much and I think I had like 4 and stopped.  They were good though.  Not too salty and just right. I'm unsure how much the total was but it was from their lunch special.  My friend had the prime rib sandwich.  Said it had to much grilled onions inside.  The service was good and our waiter was attentive.  Maybe because the manager was on the floor  Overall, we were pretty happy today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.448,2.76

They have a dictionary-sized menu and you can choose almost any mediocre dish you can think of, and unfortunately, the calorie counts are also listed. The servers are polite, though it'll take you about 20-30 minutes longer than you think because the staff is a little pokey. The last time I went there, I opted for an 800-calorie steak over a 1500-calorie salad because, hey, I'm not burning my whole day's count on a salad.

The server suggested drinks for us and also looked like sara bareilles. I had pizza earlier that day so I went with their Creole Tilapia... or so I thought. When I got my food they actually gave me the Chicken A La Fresca. You would think that I returned it and got my original order, but I was so distracted by the fact that our waitress looked liked sara bareilles that I ate my Chicken.

I've been to this location at least 3 or 4x's for lunch but today's experience topped them all. The atmosphere when you walk in is cool and the greater are nice. But I decided to eat lunch at the bar today... Biggest mistake I've made. The bartender is so sloooooowww! This lady was horrible! I asked for a glass of water and literally watched this bartender grab a glass, notice it was dirty and tried to scratch the visible dirt off of my glass with her fingernails. Disgusting!!! Ordered a cajun chicken pasta with no tomatoes & onions for my fiancé because she's allergic and I ordered a turkey club with no tomatoes. Food came out and my fiancé food looked fine. I ordered a turkey club but was brought out a 1/2 turkey cobb sandwich. Had to wave and flag the bartender down for ten minutes before she corrected my order. By the time my turkey club came out my fiancé finished her pasta to notice at the bottom there were chunks of onions and tomatoes!! She's allergic!!  After running to the bathroom to like I tried to flag the bartender down for ten minutes again and showed her the plate with tomatoes and onions. She apologized and said ""I told them no onions and tomatoes! That sucks!"" then grabbed my credit card and paid. Before signing the receipt I asked why is she still charging me for the pasta even though you guys' mistake could've killed my fiancé? She replied by saying ""I figured you guys were in a rush because you're on lunch."" I requested a manager and he never came out to speak with us. Minutes later some guy approached us claiming he was the manager with a modified receipt that removed the pasta and said he took care of it. Never apologized nor greeted himself. Overall, I'll never ever visit this location again because of their unfriendly staff, dirty dishes and lack of sympathy and responsibility for their actions.

161,Christian C.,"Chicago, IL",1716,103,11.0,1.0,2012-07-18,"UPDATE: Still NEVER heard back from anyone (no Managers or corporate people, either). What a dump! Can't believe I went there. I ate at this BJs at least once/twice a week for a few months. We have a lot of our of town corporate visitors & this 'restaurant' is across the street from our workplace. The staff is uneven (some are good & some are not). It's the management that really disappointed me.  I had a lunch with a client & things were going fairly well. The food is nothing spectacular (it always takes the same time for a salad as it does for a steak). The food was ok not great as usual. The placed had cleared out after lunch died down.   My client went to the restroom & I followed him a few minutes later to wash my hands since the drinks & food had left residue all over the table. I had tried to flag the waiter but after 5 minutes I just placed my credit card with the slip & I left my sunglasses & pen next to them to make sure the staff didn't bus the table. I finished washing  my hands & when I got back to the table it had been bused & my client had been told I had left (I got a text they were on their way to the car thinking I'd left). I was completely embarrassed.  When I tracked down my waiter instead of talking to me or getting me my glasses & pen, he ran my credit card and handed me the bill. The manager (Roberto) was rude & cut me off. He was obviously not fit for this position. The part that floored me was that the GM (Jay Clark) didn't care either. After I took time out to come back & explain what had happened to Jay, he finally said 'I don't know.' but when I asked him why I this happened or what would make me want to come back, he said, ""I don't know why you'd come back. What's the question?"". I think that sums it up. As hard as it seems, sometimes you get all the information you need.  I left a message for Bob Salesi (branch manager) but never heard from him, either.  It's hard to make people happy everytime but it's very easy to express how important your customers are to your business. Hell, even the back of Roberto's & Jay's business card says 'Bj's takes pride in passionately connecting with every guest...'  Maybe it's time to read your own business card or maybe Jay is right and there's no reason to come back here...  We no longer bring our work lunches here & I would never come back.

We found out about the $19.95 deal for a pizza, salad, soup & dessert so we decided to try it out. The hostess was snobby and I was not fond of her, but that's what you get for eating out in Hollywood. The Cesar salad and broccoli Cheddar soup was very tasty! We ordered a ""build your own"" pizza which was pretty filling since the crust was so thick. For dessert we had the classic chocolate chip pizookie which was TO DIE FOR. If anything, I would come back here again just to indulge in that. It was SO soft and just amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly! He helped us decide which pizza to get, and when we decided to add the 2 movie tickets to our order, he even made some movie suggestions! The other waiters/waitresses all seemed to be snobby and had that ""I'm better than you"" attitude that you will never fail to find in Hollywood, but Kyle was great!!  Our check was wrong when he brought it to us, and he promptly fixed it with no complaints! Prices are VERY steep here and I wouldn't come here without some kind of deal... We ended up paying about $80 for the 2 movie tickets ($15 for 2), the dinner deal, and 2 drinks from the bar. Maybe that makes me sound cheap, but I don't think that dinner should cost more than a normal grocery shopping trip :( Anyway, I would recommend it if you're willing to spend the money for it.

Considering how this was the only place opened at the Westfield Century City mall, my choices for food was severely limited. Walked into this place, which looked like a glorified Buffalo Wild Wings to me, and automatically had me thinking overpriced pub food.  However, I was surprised to find that while it stayed true to the ""pub food"" theme, its pub food was quite good. I started off with their house brewed hopstorm IPA. A delicious pint for $5.25 in LA? I think I'll take it. The IPA itself was actually sweeter than what I'm used to, offering a pleasant change. I then ordered their watermelon feta salad and the Hawaiian mahi mahi. The watermelon feta salad was absolutely delicious. It was light and sweet, just what most appetizers should be. The mahi mahi itself was mediocre, having been soaked in salt a bit too long. The pineapple rice, however, was amazing. It was cooked just long enough for it to have a cripsy tone to it, without being too overdone. The pineapple flavor wasn't too overwhelming, and gave it just enough of a balance to soak up the fish's taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=60,2.44,2.68,2.68,2.32,2.584
92,David D.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,830,1677.0,3.0,2012-12-19,"BJ's, BJ's, BJ's....what can I say...BJ's is like that friend you have that is sometimes fun to hang with, sometimes a PIA, and when you don't want to be bothered with their personality anymore, they keep finding a way back into your life. I never want to voluntarily go to BJ's, I get co-opted by the groups at the office that can't decide where else to go or worry that other places will be too expensive or too far and they revert to BJ's. I have had the Salad's here, the raw beef, the rice, chicken, margaritas, and beer. It's all fine and it won't kill you.   I wouldn't get the pizza here!  Once you go that low--it's hard to get back into Italian Food Society.  It's probably the worst you will ever have bar none--I can't eat it.  Stick to the other things on the menu and like most chains---KISS: ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""  But there has to be somewhere else.... To be honest...The last meal of chicken breast with rice and arugula from the ""Lite"" menu was really good.   I would get it again...but I still feel like life must have more to offer than an out of the box chain restaurant. Even if their Margarita with the best Tequila had a smile on my face for the next 12 hours....I still feel a need to see if there is more to life...I really need to expand my horizons. I get claustrophobic the minute I enter there off of Constellation.... Even the fake smiles and greetings from the staff does not help. Can you help me get out of the BJ's force field? Isn't there somewhere else we can go next time?  Or should I just tow the line, not ""make waves"" and get back there with the great tasting ""Lite"" meal chicken and veggies?

So, when my friend was visiting from out of town she specifically was craving her favorite restaurant, BJ's. This was our first time visiting this location and will DEFINITELY be the last: -Happy Hour drink and regular priced martini were overly weak or overly strong with no flavor - We ordered an appetizer, pizza and pasta. The cajun pasta had no sauce on it and when we asked for extra they gave us marinara sauce. In our haste to eat (we were starving), we realized it was the wrong sauce. We sent it back and the second time the chicken was extraordinarly salty. We ended up eating 2 bites. -For the pizza (mini pizza mind you): The first time they burnt the pizza so didnt send it out. The second time they rushed to make it so it was doughy (we sent it back). By now we are annoyed and hungry so we ask to talk to the manager. She was giving excuses and acknowledged the pizza was doughy, therefore she wouldnt charge us and would send another one out....waiting...waiting...NO PIZZA CAME. -Restrooms were out of toilet paper and a mess -The bartender was friendly and knew that everything sucked, so he was decent enough to take out some drinks from our check. Bottom line we paid $40 for 1 drink, 2 beers, happy hour appetizer, (no pizza), and 2 bites of an over salty pasta.

I've been to BJ's a couple of times, and none of the dishes I order are particularly memorable. The pizza is probably the best item on the menu. They give you pizza that is very doughy - if you are a fan of pizza crust with just a little bit of topping, then you would be a fan. Personally, for me, I like pizza with a bit more topping, and just have the crust be something that just holds all the ingredients together. I had the BBQ chicken pizza - it was actually pretty good. The BBQ chicken was actually made pretty tender and good - I just wished there were more of it. Also, another redeeming quality of BJ's is the pizookie. If you haven't had a pizookie before, you should go to BJ's then. Although you could probably make this at home, it's just nicer when it's delivered to you on a warm, gooey platter. A pizookie is a large cookie baked on a pizza pan, with a couple of scoops of ice cream on top. I tried both the chocolate chip and the red velvet cookie.

139,Leslie A.,"Burbank, CA",17,40,,3.0,2013-02-26,"I've been to BJs multiple times over the years in Burbank and also visited their other locations in Westwood, and now Century City. The nice thing about this chain is it's like that reliable friend that is fun, popular with everybody and you can just totally be yourself. They deliver a decent quality product and service in an upscale but casual atmosphere, with lots of menu choices so there's something for everyone. Fun for groups of friends big and small (birthdays, graduations...) family dinner, or a comfortable and relaxed date out with the hubby. All the calories are posted on the menu for those who are keeping an eye on the ball. I don't feel their dishes are particularly the most healthy...a lot of carbs, sugar in almost all the sauces and marinades, even the fish and steaks, and large portions, so be prudent if you're watching what you eat even on the lighter entree section.. That said, I have to give them props for even offering a gluten-free menu, gluten-free beers, and healthier entree choices from what you do get to choose. Not a lot of chains do that. What's been great is I have always gotten helpful answers to all my questions about menu ingredients, and they are obviously sensitive to those who have allergies, which is cool. If you want nutritional facts, they've got that printed up too. Tonight I got the mahi mahi without the soy sauce and they made sure the spicy sauce  they did include on the plate had no sugar. When the waiter came out he double checked the plate eyeing it closely to make sure they didn't accidentally put the wrong thing in. I asked if I could get steamed vegetables instead of the fried rice with stir fry. They ended up giving me the stir fry veggies minus the rice (red pepper, a small sprig here and there of cabbage, shredded carrots, pineapple and onions) which were not as healthy as some real greens like broccoli or steamed green beans, but I have to admit they were pretty tasty and went well with the fish.  With the exception of what I ordered, I feel like the prices tend to run a little high for what you get, but it's kind of one of those things were you pay a little more but know it's going to never let you down. No high highs, but no low lows either. The mahi was a lot better deal than the other entrees usually end up costing, so I was happy for once to do a large group birthday for $20 instead of twice the price and still eat healthy. As some of the other reviews have mentioned one of the unique offerings at BJs is their pizookie, which you can actually get free with dinner if you by a Masterdog card through my local high school (it supports many of the elective programs that require fund-raising.) I do appreciate the Burbank location's ongoing support of my alma mater. Tonight the Century City location (located inside the Westfield Mall)  was great in answering my questions, okay in terms of handling a big party. Everybody's food came out at slightly different intervals and since other servers were helping, they didn't know where anything went. It was like being at an auction. BBQ Wings? Caesar Salad anyone? I also would have appreciated it if they could have come out and refilled my water. I was out for half the evening, but I was having too much fun talking with the other girls to hail down a waiter. They didn't ask me if everything was okay or we needed anything (until dessert), but I did see the waiter check up on some other orders. I'm sure I will be back, but it will likely be for convenience or when I am invited by friends. Now I have a low-cal and low-cost stand-by to order when I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=120,2.32,2.49,2.49,2.444,2.422

I never really like writing reviews for chain restaurants because when it comes down to it, they're all the same, but I've had a good experience thus far at this location for a while now. The interior is nice, just as anything else at the Century City mall, and the outside patio is great also.  I have had five different waiters, and only one of them managed to piss me off. He came to our table, super nice and everything and took our order. We already knew what we wanted so it was nice and easy for him. Then he disappeared. We saw him about 15 minutes later wandering aimlessly and talking to other co-workers while leaned against the bar. Soon another waiter or busser comes with our food, and our original waiter sees him, and instead of coming over and asking if there is anything else he can get us, he waives at the busser and nods his head. Never got checked on, never got water or drinks refilled. We sat there after we ate, and our check never came. Finally a guy walks buy and asks if we needed help, and he just so happened to be the manager (Muahahaha). He closed out our bill and gave us a voucher for a free meal next time.  Then on our way out, the guy who was supposed to be waiting our tables, sees us leaving, and in the middle of taking another table's order, stops us and says ""Hey guys! You made sure to close out your bill right? Can't just leave!"" SERIOUSLY. That happened. Luckily the manager also heard him say that to us and said he'd take care of it. Enough of that banter... My favorite menu items here would have to be the Black and Bleu Burger and the California Cobb Sandwich. Both are awesome, and it's hard for me to decide each time.

Wait wasn't bad for a Friday night.  Our waiter came by relatively quickly and took our full order.  The drinks we ordered took a while to get to us and with a ""sorry, the bar's backed up"".  So, bad staffing decisions for a Friday night in Spring/Summer.  My date decided to try something unusual: A orange cream soda mixed drink.  She hated it, I tried some and agreed it was god awful.  So we both agreed it should go back and she ordered something safer. The food came out in a normal amount of time (Good job kitchen for a Friday night!).  She had a Salmon & Scallop plate which she liked.  I had a ""Sweet Pig"" deep dish pizza.  Now I take full responsibility for misreading the menu.  I thought it was kind of a Shredded Pork pizza... Not a Canadian Bacon one.  But hey that's my fault.  However the pizza was pretty god awful (Boo kitchen!).  It was bland, tasteless not even a hint of freshness and the only thing that made it ""Deep Dish"" was that it was overly puffed up.  I've had fast food pizza's taste better... One other note.  When I ordered it I got the usual ""That's a very good choice"" from the waiter.  Which always irk's me because I know it's BS (This case in point).  Unless I'm ordering a specialty or something that's known for being amazing there... Don't bother with it.  One thing I really appreciated was a Chinese Restaurant that told me on an appetizer I ordered ""No, you won't like that.  I give you something much better"" and damn they were right. So we eat and when the bill comes is the big test... Sure enough the awful drink we sent back is sitting on the bill.  They correct the mistake with a ""sorry, we're just really busy tonight"" (Meh, not really) and that's when my date suddenly realizes they never put the vegetables on her plate...

Now onto the bad side that lead to the meh review.... --To start off, the server already messed up the drink order.... no big deal as he went quickly to get another one to our request -- We've ordered the Calamari as appetizer... however, the pizza came out before the calamari... no we've cancelled the order instead... --Food was actually not as good as the other BJ's restaurant... not sure why but my cheeseburger / great white pizza are not that tasty at al all.... should of stick to my regular order of BBQ chicken instead... --No validation... serious?  (This could be the fault of the plaza owner itself..) --Attentiveness of the server... yes.. he was a nice person but we only had our drink filled once and we had to ask for it... We still left a 15% tip regardless but for a restaurant like BJs could of been much better...

The margarita they brought to the table was truly wretched. It tasted like a mix of cheap tequila and lemon juice from one of those plastic lemon juice squeeze bottles you get from the supermarket. The waiter never returned for a quality check. My friend had to track another server down to find out where his meal was because his entree wasn't delivered with our pizza. Once we got a cocktail server to our table, our INITIAL waiter grabbed her to help him with something.  An hour into the meal and we still haven't been able to send back the awful margarita. About midway into our meal, the cocktail server explained that she was going on break and our waiter was about to be cut for the night. She said this with check in hand, implying that we needed to close out, despite the fact that it was a couple of hours before closing time. As we walked out, we saw 6 workers hanging out by the host stand, laughing and joking around. Oh, and the pizza gave me indigestion. BJ's makes Chili's look like a Michelin-rated restaurant.

It's easier to grab a solo seat for a bite of lunch or dinner so you don't look weird sitting alone at a table/booth looking like you were just stood up on a date or something. But I have dined in other areas of the restaurant as well when I do bring company. Most of the bartenders double as servers so I've interacted with many of the employee's here.  Kyle, Jason, Stevie, Chad, Caleb, Kelsey, Cassie... they are only but a few bartenders/servers who I think are utter rock stars. They are also reasons why I keep returning and why I rank this place so highly. The bartenders/servers bend themselves over backwards to fix things whenever things go wrong.  The hostess's have always been polite to me. I like the food. I've never had a problem with the food here. I love the management for the most part. Erin always makes an effort to greet me every time she sees in me in the restaurant. Which is very nice!! I don't know him much but Kyle (if I got his name right), the other manager is great. I always see him smiling, all over the restaurant, and interacting with customers. I feel really bad saying this but Steven the other manager I think he's ok... I mostly see him in the front of the restaurant by the hostess stand or take out area. He has never in all my visits ever greeted or talked to me like Erin makes the effort to... and I've seen him more than I do the other managers. I saw him handle a hard situation once where someone couldn't pay their bill so I can't say anything really negative about him. But sometimes his interactions with some of the ladies I witness makes me feel as though I have an itchy sweater on at times?? (aka a little awkward??). But all in all, management is good. Sometimes the food is slow coming out. But whenever that rarely occurs the servers/bartenders are great in handling it. Apologizing and speeding it up and/or helping me to take it to go (if I have to rush back to the office). I've only experienced one bad server here but I've seen he no longer works at this BJs. So I can't say much more then that. Their lunch specials are a good deal. And I like how they have a calorie count in their menu.  I like this place. I come here for the great lunch specials, happy hour, and the service :) EDIT: I witnessed the manager Steven handle a situation very well where the food took 45 minutes to come out. He came over to the gentleman next to me and apologized, even competing an appetizer in apology.

Food is always great,especially the pizzas. When I come here I usually will get a steak dinner or pizza.  If you want pizza, go for the Great White.  It's a pizza like no other, with flavorful chicken, and is cheesy.  The steaks are average but okay; you can't compare it to Morton's or Damon's.  Appetizers are always made fresh; I like their avocado egg rolls and their boneless wings. Being that BJ's is a microbrewery, I don't have anything to say about it, because I'm not a beer drinker.  Perhaps our fellow Yelpers can attest to their beers... Dessert is where this place really shines.  The Pizookie is a great dessert that features a freshly baked, gooey cookie topped with ice cream.  I suggest the white chocolate macadamia or the red velvet.  There's also a Pizookie Sampler if you can't choose.

Beer/cider: I can't remember the name of it, but it was Jeremiah Red mixed with cider. It was watery and gross.  Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: They were okay. Edible, but nowhere near great. Stuffing was like an oily cream mixture and we couldn't taste any spinach. Meh. Crispy Artichokes: Deep fried beyond recognition. Nearly burnt. Complete mush inside and very salty. Calamari: Another meh. It was edible. They serve it with ranch. Whaaaat? Not everything needs ranch. Gross. Kids meals consisted of a pizza and grilled cheese. There were no healthy options for littles. We couldn't even get wheat bread for the grilled cheese. No fresh fruit option. Just deep-fried everything. My son complained that the pizza was salty.

We won't be back. We've really changed our eating habits in the past year, and while we knew this wouldn't be a healthy night out, we will save our splurges for places that deserve it.

13,Daniel H.,"San Francisco, CA",87,300,205.0,2.0,2014-01-14,"I've been here a few times now, and some days are a hit and others are a miss. This review is for my most recent dining experience here because I feel that this day especially was a little but more subpar that usual. Food: For a large chain restaurant, the one thing that I usually look forward to is the amount of consistency in the preparation of the meals, and that fell short on this visit. We ordered an angel hair pasta, and the pasta was cooked a little bit overdone, so it ended up being a lot more soft than normal. The first few bites seemed like they were decent, but as you ate more of it you start to realize there is something wrong with the way the pasta was cooked, which was a huge disappointment for us. We also ordered a cajun chicken pasta dish, and while the food was cooked okay, I found that there was a huge disproportion between the amount of meat to the amount of pasta. Even though everything tasted okay, there were only a few slices of meat for a whole plateful of pasta. So when the meat was gone, I just ended up with a lot of pasta that didn't taste very good on its own. Service: I was disappointed because the service here is usually better, but clearly things have changed since my last visit. I have to admit though that the servers here are polite, but the service and amount of attention we received this night was really lacking. The person helping us out took our orders, and was absent for the majority of the meal when we needed our water glasses to be refilled. We even had to ask another waiter for things because we had no idea where ours had gone for the duration of our meal. Our server finally showed up again when it came time to pay our bill, but I wished she were there for the middle of it as well. Atmosphere: It's your typical BJ's setting, and very casual overall. The one good thing about this location is that it is located in the Westfield Century CIty mall, which makes it a convenient place to grab some food after you are done shopping for the day. It's a good place to come chill and hang out with friends, and is normally even better when the food and the service are great as well! I would probably still return here, and just hope that my latest experience here was an off-night because I have definitely experienced better food and service at this location before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2,2.44,2.42,2.42,2.44,2.428

220,Kate A.,"Atlanta, GA",368,190,188.0,1.0,2014-01-24,"Okay. So occasionally I have been known to be rather...hoighty-toighty with my restaurant selections. But I'm also a total sucker for a well-made cocktail and a pizookie from BJ's. I've been to several locations throughout the years, and usually it is a pleasant experience. Today was the exception. A coworker and I ran here for a quick lunch. We were seated on the patio and introduced to our waitress, and within minutes it became apparent that she was brand new, overwhelmed and in the weeds. * I ordered an iced tea and my colleague ordered a drink. Ten minutes passed; no drinks. We asked again. Ten more minutes and no drinks. My coworker finally went to the bar and spoke to someone there, and eventually our drinks surfaced....25+ minutes too late.  * My colleague ordered a flatbread and a side of ranch dressing, and was very clear when she was stating her order. However, about 30 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came over and said she was confused about the burger. Burger? What burger!? We ordered a flatbread, and we reminded her of that. She quickly got defensive and said it must have been a miscommunication on both of our parts. Though we were being incredibly patient and understanding about the situation (we have both worked in restaurants and we get it), she quickly grew snippy with us - and for no reason at all. She went on to say that she was really busy, fresh from training, and that we confused her when placing our order. Not sure how exactly we ""confused"" her when we clearly stated what we wanted....but alas. I rest my case. * When the food finally came (mind you - an HOUR after we sat down) there was no ranch dressing and there were no utensils. It took her a good 5+ minutes to grab the utensils, so we just sat there staring at our food.  The food tasted fine, but we were so put off by the horrendous service and bad attitude that we didn't enjoy our meal. We work very close to this location, but we definitely won't be returning. If you're looking for a convenient and quick meal, I suggest you look elsewhere. The Century City Mall offers a myriad of options, and BJ's should really be a last resort option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=220,2.4,2.42,2.42,2.5640000000000005,2.412

43,Kevin B.,"Chicago, IL",217,259,153.0,3.0,2014-02-23,"Went to the one in the Westfield Mall in Century City.  From the outside you would think it was a bit more ""classier"" restaurant.  Well its not.  Its essentially an Applebees/Chilis/Bennigans type style place.   Let me say this first... Our waitress was great.  Very polite, did everything she could do to make our experience enjoyable.  The problem is she had to cover almost half the restaurant by herself which is ridiculously given we went on a Saturday night where most people would expect larger crowds.   She did the best she could but we still had to wait for long periods to get another drink, get our food, even get our menus.  But again its not a reflection on her, they were just tremendously understaffed.  Food was average.  As I said before it's just regular bar food.  I'd even say the restaurants I mentioned beforehand were better.  The drinks were good and strong so that was a huge bonus.  Had it not been for the wait to get them, the night would have been even better.  My recommendation is if you go, go sit at the bar and order food.  You will probably get better service there because judging by the reviews as well, the service here is whats really lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=40,2.28,2.41,2.41,2.8600000000000003,2.358
141,Anthony K.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,53,,4.0,2014-02-28,"I enjoyed my experience here. I went on a Friday afternoon with a good amount of customers, but me and my 7 cohorts were seated almost immediately (within a few minutes, without reserving a table), our server was very friendly (always refilling our drinks when they were getting low), and the food was good. Not fantastic, not out-of-this-world, but comforting, tasty food. The half-rack of ribs were great, but a bit on the boney side. I've had better ribs, but I haven't had a good rack of them in years, and it was nice to be reminded of how good they are. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, complimented the ribs well - but I couldn't really taste any conceivable difference between them and regular mashed potatoes. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, however, was HEAVENLY. Seriously, the bread was perfectly crisp, the soup was fresh, and it was perfect. Maybe it's just because I love bread, and I love eating things that shouldn't be eaten, but I just enjoyed the ever-loving crap out of that part of the meal. All of this, for about $20, was a pretty good deal in my opinion. It was fun, tasty, and I'm still full several hours later (and this was all I ate all day!) Overall, pretty great place to try, although I guess some people have issues with customer service and such, especially on weekends.

We sat at a booth in the bar area and had the pleasure of being served by Nicole G. We are hoping that her manager will see this review because she was by far one of the friendliest and most efficient servers any of us has had in a LONG time (not only at BJ's, but in general).  She had a bubbly personality and seemed genuinely happy to take our order and bring us anything that we needed. We were celebrating a birthday and she made an extra effort to make him feel like it was his special day. She chatted with us and even made jokes. She was quick to take our order, quick to bring our shots, drinks, appetizers, etc. Overall, she was amazing. All five of us could not get over how kind and pleasant she was throughout our dining experience. If we were to go back to this specific BJ's, I know we would all request to sit in her section.

225,Paul B.,"Saratoga County, NY",0,8,,2.0,2014-08-21,"It really upsets me that I would have to rate this location with 2 stars.  BJ's menu is extremely large and diverse.  Pretty much everything I have ordered or tried has tasted good and been enjoyable.  The Century City mall is beautiful and the location that BJ's has, including the outdoor seating, is excellent.  Sadly, the owner/management need some type of drastic wake up call regarding the service at this location. You may get lucky, but more than likely your visit to this BJ's will take you twice as long as however long you planned on spending there.  You might get upset at your server, but after personally experiencing bad service here multiple times with multiple different servers I have come to a couple of conclusions.  First, there are not enough servers scheduled for each shift.  At other restaurants (where you get good service) you might see your server at 3, 4, or maybe 5 tables other than your own.  I have observed servers at this restaurant waiting on 8-10 or possibly more tables at once.  There is no way you are getting good service from someone who is trying to juggle that many customers at one time.  Second, as a result of their customer load, servers start performing poorly, forgetting things, forgetting about tables, or develop attitude issues (likely from being screamed at by annoyed, waiting customers). Not worth saying much else.  The food is pretty good, the location is cool, but the service ruins it.  If the management could staff the restaurant appropriately this place would get 4-5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=220,3.12,2.66,2.66,2.504,2.8440000000000003

Came here a couple times with my coworkers for lunch, and almost every time the service is lacking and food is just OK.  Most recent visit experience: Ordered the mahi-mahi (light entree) and the fish was too dry. BJ's isn't cheap, so I expect pretty decent quality, which means at least not-so-dry mahi mahi. Service was even worse. We came for my coworker's birthday, and everything went wrong... We were seated promptly. But after given our menus, our waitress completely forgot about us for 15 minutes and we had to get her attention to take our order. She first takes down our drink orders and comes back 5 minutes later to take the rest of our food orders. Our appetizers come before our drinks do, and yet again we had to ask a different waiter where our drinks were, and he apologized and said he will let our waitress know. Ironically, our waitress brought us our drinks looking as if we had asked for something ridiculous and didn't offer any apology. BJs offers a mini pizookie for anyone's birthday, so we waited a good 20 minutes after we finished our meal for the pizookie but it never arrived (this is after we had already asked the waitress once about it 15 minutes in and she said she would check with the kitchen).

Time kept passing and we never had our appetizer come out and we kept looking for this waiter and he was no where to be found. Finally, another guy brought our actual entrees out and we looked at the guy a little confused and he looked at us a little rudely until we explained that our appetizer never came out, he said he was going to check on that but he also never came out. We REALLY wanted those nachos so we talked to a lady waitress and she also said she'll check on that and never came back out. at that point, our dinner was ruined, not because we were craving nachos but because we had already told 3 people we wanted those nachos and nobody at no point came out to apologize or to tell us what was up with that or to atleast tell us who our new waiter was, UNTIL CHARLES CAME OUT! He came to our table and let us know the situation that our original waiter hadn't even put the nachos in the system not only that but after a few minutes of seeing our unsatisfied faces, he offered us a dessert on the house. He made everything alright in the world! After he became our waiter everything was good, he talked to us about our day and little small talk like that. It was all good after charles and instead of giving BJs a 1 star review, ONLY because of Charles am i giving a 3 star review.

This one, not so much. The food was as you'd expect from a brewpub. However, you couldn't get a water glass or another beer to save your life. We had a decent sized group (ten adults), and we sat waiting for ALL of the food to come out. All of this is forgiveable. Except the roach. Just before we were about to leave, I went to grab my jacket and noticed a sizeable cockroach walking around like he owned the place. We reported it to the server who said ""I've worked here for two years and I've never seen a cockroach."" We called over the manager, who said because it was raining and they had patio doors (that were not open) that sometimes they wander in. Still, not acceptable. No one was going for it until the table behind us jumped up in horror. This thing was about 2 inches long, red, and nasty. Needless to say, they asked to be moved. Still, none of the staff nor the manager were apologetic. Then my mother saw it wandering toward our table again, my aunt jumped out of her chair in horror, and my uncle squashed it with his foot, the evidence indisputable. Even after feeling vindicated by its irrefutable presence and ultimate demise (I swear I thought it was in my shoe or in my jacket), there was no apology or recompense. Even after my aunt raised holy hell because, let's be honest, there's some health code violations here, there was an offer of a gift card (because we'd be back?).

The food was adequate but I was mostly just killing time until work. My server however was completely charming and I can't say enough about her. I've been in LA for less than a month and angel said she could see that. I discussed a desire to lose my southern accent so as to not come off as a hillbilly to others. She encouraged me to keep it bc it's more charming to be myself in such an area. She was completely adorable both in appearance and in attitude and it was incredibly comforting that she was so kind and not overbearing or fake. I actually only joined yelp as I'm sitting in my booth so I could rave about the sweet and genuine demeanor she allowed me to experience.

I explained I loved beers brewed with fruits since gives them a subtlety sweet note without making them sweet like ciders. She said they didn't have anything like that but recommended the hefe for its notes of citrus. It was purrfect.  We ordered Potato Skins cause I've been craving them for the 1st time in years. They were cooked perfectly but they were hardly garnished with cheese, bacon, maybe 5 tiny uneven slices of chives :( they had all the potential to be derish! Just divide the appropriate amount of garnishes up among the individual potato skins!  2.5/5   Then we got the Asians Chicken Lettuce Wraps because we felt like fattys and that sounded healthy. They were a hard pass... as I'm sure most of you expected. 1/5 just no. We also ordered 2 margaritas which we had to send back cause they were so sweet and sour it was literally undrinkable!

I took a seat outside in the patio and it took about 15 minutes for anyone to even come and give us our drinks. We couldn't even put in our food orders because our assigned waiter was nowhere to be seen. After maybe fifteen more minutes of waiting, another waiter just took our order because the one that was supposed to be there was in a meeting! The waiter that we ended up with was pretty nice but I just thought that it was poor coordination on the management's side. To add to that, when we got our beers, the whole glass of beer was drenched in spilled beer. And lastly, we just gave them the credit card before we got the check and we only realized when we got home that they overcharged us for one more beer. Okay that was kind of our bad for giving our card before we got the check but it was only because we were just so tired of waiting for whole dmmed meal!! Long story short, the service sucks. BUT the happy hour menu is good enough for me to not give them a 1 star. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2?start=60,2.52,2.82,2.648,1.864,2.7

The best thing was it was Happy Hour, and there was football, and there was a lot of good looking men in the bar area. So normally for a dining experience like this I would only give them 1 star - but I give them an extra point for the ambiance.  We sat at a table to order happy hour. Cocktails were only $1 off. I ordered a Peach Margarita. It arrived - sugar all over the rim of the glass. So sickening sweet I could barely drink it. I looked at the menu, nowhere did it say sugar on the rim. My friend tried it and said it didn't even taste like a margarita.  I never, ever send anything back, but I had to send this back. I told the Waitress it was totally undrinkable. She brought me another Peach Margarita - a very weak peach margarita. It tasted like a peach margarita, but there was very little alcohol. Terrible cocktails. Should have ordered a beer or wine instead. So after that, my friends and I are chatting, and we start saying ""Wheres our food?"". So we have to hail down the waitress, and ask her to go check on our food. It finally arrives. My Mahi Mahi tacos were okay, nothing fabulous, just okay. They came with chips.  Then we get our checks.  No happy hour discounts applied on any of the happy hour items. We are charged full price. My friend had ordered a deep dish pizza which was supposed to be half off. I know mine is only $1 off the cocktail, but its the principle of the thing - you say you are going to give me a dollar off, then give me the dern dollar off.  They adjust the bills, and my friends still isn't right. By this time we call the Manager over, and the Manager works on getting the bills corrected to reflect the Happy Hour prices. Then on top of that, they do not validate for parking in the Mall.  If you are coming here to eat food, forget it. I think you would have a better time if your came to watch football with the guys during happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-los-angeles-2,2.32,2.82,2.628,,2.62

We decided to order an amazing deep dish pizza to stare. Yum! When the pizza was dropped we didn't have any utensils. Hmph. He delivered and apologized so we were fine. A little later, our server asked us if we were ready for dessert as we had mentioned before, but given we still had over 1/2 a pizza sitting in front of us, we told him we would wait. 30 minutes, lingering dirty dishes, empty glasses, and a assist from a fellow server later he came back to take our dessert order. He returned less than two minutes later with the check, silently dropped it, and walked off. Wait... we hadn't even gotten our food yet! What if we wanted coffee with our dessert? At this point we were all completely irritated as well. Being a server I understand if you're cut and want to go home. Maybe the host sat a closed section? Who knows. Regardless if you need us to pay ask us or transfer the check to another server. Communicate please. The restaurant was STILL open! So when he came back to get the check I told him we would pay when we were done with our meal. That definitely pissed him off and he stormed off. Call it petty, but he was being extremely rude from the get go and we wanted to enjoy our meal, especially with our visiter. Again, the restaurant was STILL open.
