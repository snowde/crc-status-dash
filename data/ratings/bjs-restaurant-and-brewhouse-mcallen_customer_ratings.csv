50,Kelly S.,"Austin, TX",2561,1557,7025.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"BJs is conveniently located by all the ""new"" stores on Ware rd. When you're out shopping, frustrated as hell by the wonky parking lot and disrespectful best buy shoppers, this is a decent spot to grab a table, some relatively inexpensive appetizers and a high ABV beer.  The service is usually decent, if unremarkable. My mom loves the sausage and basil flatbread so much that she ordered one as an appetizer for all of us and one for herself, for her meal. The avocado egg rolls are kinda boring as is the tortilla soup. My asian salad was okay as well.  All in all, not bad. The chain is pretty consistent across the board and I can appreciate that they are able to translate that across markets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=40,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

61,Justin E.,"Harlingen, TX",16,15,10.0,1.0,2012-07-31,"This has got to be one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited. The customer service was HORRIBLE! First, our waiter took over 10-15 minutes JUST to come and welcome us and since we had a child, he forgot her menu, not once but 3 TIMES! We felt very rushed by him because he was very antsy and constantly looking around and checking the time. When we put in our drink order, he took a while to come back for our food order. When he returned I had already finished my first drink and placed the glass at the end of the table for him to take to refill. I SAW him glance at it and ignore it. He passed by it about 2 or 3 times before I finally had to tell him that I wanted a refill. I had ordered Strawberry Lemonade and let me tell you, I've had better. I should of seriously just gone down on restaurant and eat at Cheddar's. Anyway, we put in our orders, My friend and I's entree was Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo, Macaroni for the little girl, and my other friend had dessert because he had already eaten earlier.  The food arrives and we requested ketchup because the little one had gotten potato wedges. The Alfredo was so bland and tasteless even with salt and pepper. The chicken was alright, but the bread that comes with it was so hard! Well the little girl preferred the Alfredo since my friend didn't like it, so they traded. As soon as she puts her fork in the plate, she pulls out a large piece of plastic that looked like it was from a microwavable bag, since it had heating directions. Needless to say, she did not eat that. When the waiter comes back, ages later, we had to request ketchup a second time and the manager. When he returns, he said the manager would be there shortly. I did not see him go tell the manager till about 10 minutes later. The manager shows up and I explain to him our situation and he immediately begins to apologize profusely, which I appreciated, and he asked if we wanted to replace the meal, we decided against it and he said it would be taken off our ticket, which it was.   All in all, I was not very pleased, and the bill was ridiculous. $14 for a plate of tasteless pasta! We will more than likely not be returning for a VERY long time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=60,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
35,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",409,257,953.0,4.0,2012-08-13,"Located in the center of the newest McAllen developmental area and convention center, BJ's is always full of people but even with a full restaurant, I've never had to wait! Score. The menu is huge with over 14 pages of brewskis, vinos, salads, pizzas, apps and even steaks ::pink up:: - how do you choose what to get? I'm a creature of habit and when I find something I like (especially at  a chain restaurant) I tend to stick to it. Start off with one of their beer/cider blends... they're interesting & mostly yummy! If you don't drink alcohol, I'd suggest a draft root beer or cream soda! If you want an appetizer but don't want to order too much, get a couple of the ""small plates"". My favorites are the meatballs and crispy artichokes. I love their chopped salads (BBQ and Crispy Chicken), pizzas (with whole wheat crust) and pizookie cookie deserts!  Customer service isn't the best.... very medicore. The servers I've had at this location were dry and boring (even when my dad cracked a sad joke) but when they brought the bill, their demeanor changed as if one smile at the end of the meal would give them a 20% tip. My dad likes watching football games in restaurant bars & their TV is HUGE (literally 100 inches) & daily drink specials are pretty good. It's very weird for me to give a chain restaurant 4 stars but the food has always been good and the bar is a cool place for a drink & small plate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=20,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001
65,John B.,"Harlingen, TX",0,21,,3.0,2012-09-11,"BJ's has always been one of our Valley favorites, usually worth the drive from Harlingen. The food is consistently good (not great) and the service OK. We sometimes watch a major sports event on their 100"" TV while eating in the bar. We also order takeout once or twice a month. Several of our favorites are pot stickers, sesame chicken salad, egg rolls, wings, and pizza. I'm surprised BJ's isn't ranked higher than #14 in McAllen. It would be in the top three in Harlingen.  9/11/12 UPDATE -- Takeout last evening was worst ever. Pot stickers were bland and the sesame chicken salad (price raised to $13) was tasteless. To make matters worse they packed about 3/4 normal dressing after I asked for extra dressing! This will be our last visit for a while because it's no longer worth the 34 mile drive from Harlingen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=60,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

If I didn't know better I would have thought they had a connection with the guys in California who have been catching squid by the hundreds. Good wine selection, had a very good Russian Valley Chardonnay. Jackie was my waitress, I never had to ask for anything, she anticipated it before I could ask. The kinda bad news- the chef needs to take a trip to Lafayette, LA. Adding 1.5 pounds of green onions to a tomato sauce and pouring it over pasta does not a Cajun pasta make. It was really bland.

45,Anna B.,"Austin, TX",1,32,2.0,3.0,2013-05-05,"The ceilings are high, the light is low and the prices are above average. Start with the menu: several pages, encased in vinyl and bound like a notebook. There is a lot to consider there but in the low light, I probably missed a few things. It's ironic, there was a lamp suspended right above us but still we could barely read the print on the menu. Our waitress was pleasant enough and checked on us often. But she's not the one who brought out the food. This must be one of those places where it takes a village to serve a meal. The food was okay, not bad, but nothing outstanding. The kitchen's approach to seasoning is not balanced: their chili is fairly bland but the CFS is overly salty and a little heavy on the garlic tones in the breading. Their fries are crispy shoestring-style and good. They use Roma tomatoes on their burgers so they have a bit of flavor. The ""huge"" baked potatoes are indeed huge. I would have appreciated being given the option of leaving off some toppings or having them on the side but mine came fully loaded, no turning back. Maybe if I could have read the menu more easily, I would have seen the full list so I will take some responsibility for that. The atmosphere is that of a slightly upscale sports bar trying to be a date place. There were women in sequins and stilettos; some men in suits, others in cargo shorts. There were a few children but I wouldn't really consider this to be a family restaurant, at least not on a weekend evening. The darkness and loud urban music would make my child uncomfortable. And the TVs? They have TVs alright, and there is no escaping them. The bar is prominently stocked with a large variety of higher-priced hard liquors. The bottle display is perhaps the most brightly lit area of the whole restaurant. You can easily tell what is important here.  The managers make a point to come over and greet customers. Ours said all the right things but his words seemed rehearsed, possibly scripted.  Over all, it's not a bad place but we don't expect to go back. It was not a great value for the money. The dining room is much too dark and the noise level (an odd mishmash of musical genres did not help) was a little too much. The place seems to appeal to the Generation Y types who like flash with their drinks and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7640000000000002,3.2400000000000007

22,Amy L.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,18,2.0,4.0,2015-09-30,"Had a nice long hospital shift here in Texas. After our adventurous palate led us to disaster last night, we wanted to go ahead and try to safety of the large menus that BJs had to offer. We started with the stuffed mushroom, and the Siracha Brussels sprouts. The Siracha Brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection. The creamy Siracha sauce was spicy enough to give an interesting kick, without upsetting my somewhat sensitive stomach. The mushrooms gave me an off aftertaste. They are supposedly stuffed with artichoke spinach, but it tasted more like a jar of Kraft fettuccini sauce and some broccoli.  For dinner I was craving a salad. The picture of the ahi tuna salad looked incredible. So far our service has been very quick and our server seems nice. Update haven't seen our server in a very long time. Hope she's ok Update still no sign of server. She is visible. She is alive. I want desserts in the form of cookie goodness they call a pazookie. Pazookie has arrived. I am happy again. This cookie makes me so happy. The food was filling and absolutely delicious. For a restaurant that wasn't busy by any standards, our server did disappear for a long period of time... But it happens. I would definitely come back if I needed to ever be in this part of Texas again.  Thanks BJs.

I asked if they forgot sauce and the server and manager both said pizza sauce was not used on Bj's pizzas. Pizza with no sauce? This went from being one  of the best pizzas in town to the worst.

(again still not able to ask for our drinks). Now this would've been fine had the pizza been hot. Unfortunately it wasn't. It was warm at best.

A bit unfair to judge harshly when an establishment is an hour from closing but these guys just couldn't get it right. Plus we'd have been in and out much quicker without the following issues.  I was with 4 others and was told about about 5-10 minutes after ordering the item wasn't available - which means I had to sit waiting for my new order while everyone else's food came out earlier.

8,Michael J.,"McAllen, TX",0,15,,3.0,2017-06-19,"My wife and I visited today, so I thought I would get around to finally writing a review. First off... the food at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is pretty expensive; unless you have a coupon or order one of their specials. The food does taste good and they are a very techie restaurant (and I like tech), so it sort of balances things out. My wife and I use the BJ's app where you can place your order before you leave the house and they start working on it as soon as you are being shown to your table (the hostess checks the order in). My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl ($12.95) and I ordered the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich with fries ($14.95). The wait for the food was about 20 minutes (a little bit on the long side considering we were seated at 3:40 PM and the restaurant was practically empty) even though our order went in before we were seated. The food arrived pipping hot and we were also warned about the hot plates by our server. The fries are seasoned and very tasty; they serve a generous portion. The Prime Rib Dip is very tender and the au jus had a good flavor; just right for sandwich dipping. For me, the $14.95 for a sandwich and fries is a little on the pricey side considering you can get a full meal at similar restaurants for less. My wife's told me that her Chicken Quinoa was very delicious with just the right amount of ingredients to complement the chicken breast (Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, sautéed red onions, sliced mushrooms, sautéed spinach, seasoned tomatoes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil & lemon juice). Our server checked in on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. The service was good! We paid our bill through the BJ's app which accepts Apple Pay (very convenient) and our receipt was emailed to us. Reason for Rating: Cost was a big part of it. Though the items were very good, the quality was comparable to restaurants like Logan's and Chili's where you can get a full meal for less. Had the prices been a little bit cheaper, I would have given the restaurant four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
