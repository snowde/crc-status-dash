42,Stefany T.,"Painesville, OH",0,5,6.0,5.0,2016-08-30,This place was really good. Me and a friend were invited to a private opening for the new staff basically a training session. The menu is large lots to choose from. We ordered 2 appetizers the queso dip with pulled pork and the honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts they were AMAZING! We ordered 2 pizzas they were good not enough sauce but decent flavor. The best part of the meal was dessert their warm pizza cookies with ice cream has a wanting to go back for more.

They offered me a ""call ahead"" and I set it for 7:30 that night. When I arrived at 7:30 they let me know there would be a wait and there was! We were finally sat at 8:30. Pleasantly surprised the food selection was great and the taste was worth the wait. They won my heart with the flavor and service. It was their first week so I cut them some slack. Bria was great! Friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyed her attention to detail and bubbly personality. Great job to Damien for taking care of my wife so promptly.

I then suggested that was fine we would break up the group accordingly He indicated that would not work either. I asked if it was a staffing issue. The manager said no. I felt by his tone  he was being bothered rather than being apologetic. Not a good first impression for the new Mentor location.

82,Bob B.,"Mentor, OH",3,12,6.0,4.0,2016-09-05,"Forgive me Dr. Robert Atkins, for I have sinned...again.  It's a temporary setback, but I simply couldn't help myself.  You see, I just went to the new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Mentor, OH.   My wife and I attempted to visit the new BJ's on a Friday but were greeted with the 'ol ""thanks for coming we can seat you in about 3 days"" nugget.   Given it was already about 2 hours since my last beer, we had to move on...stat.   On Labor Day my wife offered to take me to lunch if I'd go shopping with her.  In a moment of weakness I succumbed to the Siren Song of a free meal.  ""Let's try that salad place!"" she exclaimed.  The childlike look of dejection on my face was enough for her to suggest we try BJ's again.  I love this woman. Ambiance - Although it's a brand new building it has the air of an old open brick warehouse converted to a restaurant.  When you walk in the entire eating area is visible.  To left is the lengthy, stylish and well-stocked bar.  The back lit display of top shelf bourbons and a bar's length craft beer handles was particularly appealing. To the right is seating featuring what I can only describe as ""The Garage Doors to Nowhere"".  You'll see what I mean.  The seating is ample, but not crowded, and the faux oversized crown molding on the back wall above the Fenway Park Green Monster sized beer list make for cozy atmosphere.  Vertically the place opens all the way up to the roof with all the supports and mechanicals stylishly exposed to the patrons.  All in all a very good venue to strap on the feedbag..! Service - The service peeps were very friendly and enthusiastic if not a tad inexperienced (to be expected).  Once they get their sea legs they'll be just fine.  They were overstaffed which I attribute to training but it wasn't overwhelming.  There were some awkward moments when I had specific questions about the food prep and menu, but no biggie.  It would have been nice to be made aware the Monday special was  1/2 priced large pizza.  I ordered the mini but discovered on my own that the large would have cost the same.  I was able to change the order in time to take advantage (and have leftovers for 3 days).  We were well attended to throughout the meal.  The service certainly shouldn't be a deterrent to trying BJ's.  I expect it to be well above average in a few weeks. Food & Beverage - Sometimes craft beer places let their kegs get a little stale.  However, my GLB Dortmunder and my wife's Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale tasted very fresh and were perfectly chilled and carbonated.  We started with the Calamari appetizer.  It wasn't bad but maybe lacked a little taste.  I liked that it was fried a little crispier... my wife not so much.  I ordered the large Spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza.  This, and the beer, is where I fell off the low carb wagon...hard.  The large is ""large"" and the deep dish is ""deep""!  The dough/crust is very thick and bready like a deep dish should be.  The crust was perfectly crispy on the edges and had a distinct buttery taste. The toppings were fresh, tasty and plentiful.  It could easily feed 3-4 adults to their gluttonous satisfaction.  I have no idea what my wife ate I was too busy with my head buried in the trough.   Value - When I mean value I mean when the quality/enjoyment of the experience meets with the cost of the experience.  My impression was the cost was a tad high. I'd say 15% to 20% more than a comparable eating experience.  However, I think it's a good value considering all the factors.   Bottom Line - Go to BJ's!  It may be hard to get in during peak times for while but give it go.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  It's definitely a place I'd take out of town guest to show off Mentor, OH a little or to celebrate any special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor?start=40,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

72,Heather S.,"Perry, OH",9,23,8.0,2.0,2016-09-10,"Given this is a new restaurant in our area and its a busy Saturday afternoon, we may have to try again. Huge disappointment!! We were greeted at the door and seated fairly quickly. Walking back to our table, the floors are very slippery. I had flip flops and husband had tennis shoes on. The hostess agreed the floor was hard for her to maneuver with non slip shoes. After she walked away, we sat for at least 10min while plenty of tables around us had servers buzzing by. My husband flagged one down to get us a server. Once our server arrived, with no apology, we went ahead and ordered basic cheese burgers medium well. Food arrived quickly from a food service person, who plopped the food down and took off. There was no ketchup on the table for fries but figured our server would arrive and ask if we needed anything. She did arrive after we ate about half our food. The burger tasted good but was pink in the middle. Overall, a big disappointment and there are plenty of options elsewhere around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor?start=80,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
19,Andy C.,"Mentor, OH",5,15,12.0,4.0,2016-09-11,"We're so lucky here in Lake County - we have just about every kind of restaurant. And BJ's is an okay addition. If you're a beer drinker with a group of friends and want something better than Fridays... then you found the spot. Atmosphere is benign if not boring. Seating and decor are nothing special and will feel like every other restaurant on the planet. Let's remember, before we rip them a new one, that the place is new and the staff is too. So yes... there was a little slowness even at 4:30pm. And when our waitress asked if we were ready my husband said simply, ""Yes"" and she smiled at him and walked away. There were definite hold ups at the POS stations. Which is expected at this stage of the game - people are learning. BIG alcohol selection. And I do not drink. So I tried their ""Botanical Blend"" Peach Sunrise. Not bad. Hubby had black cherry root beer- GREAT flavor. Appetizer was spinach stuff mushrooms. MUCH better than Olive Gardens version of same. Not served dripping in oil and grease, with a little bit of cream sauce finish. But holy crap... let's talk menu size. Gordon Ramsey would marinara his pants... waaaaay too many options. Dinner was Jambalaya for me with a cup of chilli (my weakness) and hubby had deep dish ziti. Chilli was thick, meaty with a great flavor from the beer that's in it. LOVE IT. Jambalaya was one note... and would not stand up to anyone's creole Gram's recipe. It was well cooked. Just no biggie. Hubby said ziti was 4 stars out of 5. He actually ate the whole thing which never happens. With tip we spent  $60. In the end, we'd go back. I'd seriously get take out of just that chilli to be honest... in a bread bowl... score!

They'll put Max and Erma's under for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

53,Brian S.,"Jefferson, OH",0,5,13.0,4.0,2016-09-11,"At time of this writing, this restaurant had only been open for about 2 weeks. The revolving door at the entrance was unexpected but simple to operate; my wife had no issues with it. The hostess was very friendly and greeted us with a smile and, ""welcome to bj's, have you ever been to bj's?""  [insert joke here]. The inside of the establishment was clean, well illuminated and had several televisions around the inside perimeter, making Sunday afternoon football a breeze to watch. (The Eagles were up 7-0 against the Browns when we left). My wife ordered a root beer and I had the stout, both of which were terrific. So, on to the meal. I ordered the guac bacon cheeseburger with fries, which happens to be what I normally order at any bar and grill restaurant so I've have my share of bacon cheese burgers. This one had a liberal amount and heavy chunks of guac along with small bits of bacon and some lettuce and tomato. The thin'ish meat patty was a bit over done and a little dry and was almost overpowered with smoke flavor, though I still enjoyed eating it (probably because I was hungry). The fries were shoestring fries and cooled down quickly but still somewhat enjoyable. My wife really liked them but I prefer a thicker fry so this is definitely a matter of preference. If you like shoestring fries, you'll probably love these. My wife had a salad with small mozzarella balls, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, balsamic vinegar, etc., and it was FANTASTIC !!!!  She mentioned her sandwich was good too but could not remember was it was called by the time we made it to the parking lot. The waitress was very friendly, albeit a bit inexperienced (no big deal), and the meal delivery was prompt. We enjoyed this experience and will probably try it again in the future when we are looking for something a little better than fast food.

Our food arrived promptly, our server provided excellent and efficient service, and the atmosphere was lively.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience except for one complaint:  We are not beer drinkers, so we wanted to order some cocktails.  The menu DOES NOT list prices and we soon found out why.  All the mixed alcoholic drinks are very over-priced (a Bacardi rum and coke was $8.75 and a Sangria was $9 or $10).  Overpricing the mixed drinks will prevent guests from returning for a second time and/or making this brewery a regular stop.  After the excitement of a new restaurant in the area, I am afraid the clientele will diminish.  We would certainly return if this franchise would make the recommended adjustments; however, until then, we'll go back to our standard favorite restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor?start=80,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

The caprese salad was good but the ""fresh mozzarella"" tasted like it had been cut that morning and had dried out. I had the parm crusted chicken but the star of that dish was definitely the white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the ziti which he described as ""okay"" because the sheer amount of different ingredients caused the dish to lose its identity. Definitely save room for the pozookie desert! Natalie was our server, have had her before at Applebee's, that lady is five star. Our experience was pretty solid until afterwards.

92,Nunya B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,8,,1.0,2016-11-30,"I used to work here, so you guys have an inside perspective. I'll start with the food. It is very good, except the burgers. They taste no better than Burger King's flame broiled burgers. I recommend the flat bread pizzas, or their salads are great and big portions (the Santa Fe is BOMB). There are a ton of very healthy options too, but they get expensive, like the salmon quinoa bowl. As for the service, it is very iffy and hit or miss. Some people who serve there are wonderful people! But many of them are terribly rude, not only to fellow coworkers, but customers as well. The management is HORRIBLE. The general manger made a mistake at the expense of my table, and blamed me, and called me a ""f**king idiot"" because he didn't want to take responsibility for his mistake. It is also his job to make sure tables are okay, and every time I asked him to do something, he would be visibly aggravated, and tell me to find someone else to deal with it. I've worked in management before, and you DO NOT treat your employees that way. It is completely uncalled for. The other managers are okay, but unfortunately many of them have left because the environment is so toxic. And that is also why I left. It's difficult to be enthusiastic about your job when you are constantly belittled. The turnover rate for this restaurant is the worst I have ever seen. So, that has got to tell you something. It's really unfortunate because this is a great chain, and the company itself offers a lot of opportunity to move up, but I just couldn't stay in a job where I felt unappreciated and belittled on a daily basis. I hope they fix all the issues, because they're going to have a tough time keeping employees and customers at this rate. Also, the floors are extremely slippery. I don't recommend bringing older people here, who use a walker or cane. I've seen multiple customers fall, and one of them was an older gentleman.

However what came out was a chicken parmesan style pita pocket thing which was absolutely delicious none-the-less but it wasn't what I ordered. No it was lunch and are servicing to you a little bit frazzled but my main reason for three stars was that the entire time I was there there were stacks of dirty plates that would never bussed off of the table.   As our lunch when on the stack of dirty plates just got higher and higher and higher almost humorous. It's several different points we did see the server come by and look at the stack of dirty plates and just keep walking.

You're beautiful and you cook good food, but you're service makes me feel like you just don't care about me.  In the theme of Festivus, below are my grievances: 1) The app's ""Preferred Waitlist"" is misleading. I logged in from home, added myself to the wait list and received a time of 25 minutes. I check-in and am told it will be 25 minutes, ok, fine, I'm already there. 50 minutes later, after speaking to a manager, we're seated. Either they quote you a lower time to keep you from leaving, when they know it'll be a longer wait, or the process is broken.  I had to wait to speak with the manager because someone else was also complaining about their ""Preferred Waitlist"" experience.  2) Since we had 50 minutes to decide on our food, we ordered immediately upon sitting down.  By checking-in with the app, I was able to track my ticket time by seeing the exact moment the order was entered. Ticket time: 40 minutes. Unacceptable for pizza, breaded chicken and kids pasta. After a bad service experience on my previous visit, I received a survey directly from BJ's corporate. I completed it and was provided a $15 coupon (as an apology) for a future visit, so we decided to give it another shot.

The hubs and I went on a Friday afternoon we were off from work and took the lil McDuo... now most servers see one kid and freak out let alone two toddlers our server didn't do that she was amazing.  Sabrina immediately said ""can I get you a starter for them?"" which was a garlic knot and fruit - keep them occupied stop the screaming and let us look at the menu.  We had come in for the soup and salad lunch special - different soups different salads and you can swap each round. Totally awesome idea and lets you try more of their signature dishes.   The wedge salad possibly one of the best wedge salads I've ever had.  House salad OK not remarkable need some kick; I don't know cheese bacon egg something... The soups the chicken tortilla it was delicious and garnished awesomely with sliced avocado.  The cheddar broccoli delicious very cheesy not a lot of broccoli.  My husband loved the clam chowder in fact he had two bowls said it was delicious creamy & lots of clams. The tomato bisque was good very tomato he needed a grilled cheese dip in! Lol.  Also they have a kids menu and a bigger kids menu - perfect for two littles to split! The grilled chicken and mashed potatoes was a hit!  Their beers that we sampled were good - the brown ale, the Belgian, the fruity cider - all delicious.

Even if the service sucks on a particular night, I understand. Just because a server is backed up or running behind, I tip well.  My server tonight did not deserve anything.  I was dead set on giving her $0 for her unpleasant b***h attitude but when she came with the check, I chickened out and gave her a few dollars because I still felt bad that servers don't make much.  My wife and I were sat at 7:12.  At 7:27, our server came to our table and said she'd be right with us.  At 7:36, she said she was dealing with a large party and that's why we had to wait so long.  I thought that was a crappy excuse, but whatever.  I'm cool, no worries, all that. We each ordered a soda and burgers, and I got a side salad. That was the last we saw of our server until she gave us the check. At 7:52, we got our sodas.  At 7:56, I got my side salad.  At 7:59, I got tired of waiting for someone who worked there to pass by, so I went to the front counter to get the silverware we were never given. I didn't check the time when we got our food but it was around 8:10.  The burgers were super good. Their burger sauce they had is ridiculously delicious. Then we waited for the check until 8:20.  We had assumed our server had gone home and we were just a forgotten table that food runners were taking care of but then our server we hadn't seen for half an hour showed up and asked if we wanted dessert. We sure did! The reason I wanted to go there tonight was specifically for those Pizookie things. Unfortunately, the service was so slow, we didn't have time to order them. We had already been there for over an hour and didn't have an hour to waste on waiting for dessert. When we told her we didn't have time for dessert she said ""Are you suuuure"" in a super condescending tone.  What the hell did we do to you, lady? It's a shame but my wife and I both agreed that we weren't coming back.  I know that's what customers say when they are annoyed and trying to make the manager or owner feel bad, knowing full well that they are going to come back in the future.  I'm not just saying that for attention.  This is the second time we've been to BJ's and the second time we've received poor service.   Bye bye, BJ's Brewhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.1120000000000005,3.1600000000000006

The food runners brought our food out while it was still fresh and then multiple staff hurried to get us anything we were missing. Our glasses were kept full. Hopefully this place has turned the corner and I'm raising my rating. My burger patty was made too thin and wasn't holding together because of that fact. Pieces were crumbling off when I picked it up. The other two burgers at our table were much thicker with integrity enough to eat. The flavor of the burger was excellent and I appreciate they obviously make them fresh. The soft buns were perfect and fresh. I wish they'd offer fresh cut fries instead of frozen. Great job on improving the service! 4/17: UPDATE I'm disappointed to not be able to change my rating on this restaurant. They've been open now in this location long enough to work out the kinks.

The sliders were small (with about 1/3 of the bun empty), boring (only a tiny patty and a couple pickle slices and shredded iceberg on the side), and dry and we needed to ask for ketchup to make them worth eating. The potato skins were decent, but didn't come out hot. The root beer wings were good. Tried their German beer this time and enjoyed that. I just cannot believe the number of staff they have on and how hard it is to get any of their attention!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mentor,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
