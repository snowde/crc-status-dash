197,Jeremy P.,"Phoenix, AZ",170,328,46.0,2.0,2012-01-04,"Pretty middling.  The Black and Bleu burger was a respectable middle-tier burger.  It came with ""seasoned fries,"" but I'm pretty sure the only thing on them was salt.  I guess salt is technically a seasoning... I had their on-tap root beer, which they tout as having a slight toffee and vanilla taste.  I would've liked to taste more toffee (hardly noticeable) and less vanilla.  I'm not a fan of vanilla; it makes a root beer taste a little too weak.  Give me more sassafras, maybe a touch more wintergreen, and drop the vanilla.   Overall, it's not a bad meal for the money, but it's pretty unspectacular.  I guess you can't expect a whole lot from a pizza chain...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9520000000000004,3.3600000000000003

There is not much that i would consider exceptional about BJ's except perhaps their extensive menu and the variety of choices provided.  There are plenty of Televisions and the selection of beer is great.  All in all ""A-OK"" is a bulls eye for rating this establishment... I had the Bleu Burger and it was very good.  My wife had the Miso Salmon over Japanese rice and she really liked her meal a lot.  The refills are sparse and you prctically have to throw a fit to get a glass of water, but this restaurant is a safe bet for a good meal at a fair price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=180,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9560000000000004,3.4800000000000004

The only downside is that the service isn't always great.  Also, I've witness the staff using the parking spots in the front for themselves.  This says to me the restaurant is poorly managed.  Fix that and you'd probably have a 5 star restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=160,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.024,3.5600000000000005
212,Jason H.,"Gilbert, AZ",10,46,4.0,3.0,2012-06-23,"We've eaten here a couple of times, so this review is a summation of those visits. I have tried a couple of things from the light menu and a couple of salads not on the light menu. The light deep dish pizza is OK. It's an individual size pizza with grilled veggies. It's just OK. They don't smother the thing in cheese, which is probably the easiest way to keep the calories on this item under 600. I've also tried a chicken dish from the light menu. It was unremarkable. As far as regular salads go, the steak salad is OK, as is the seared ahi salad. The ahi salad is probably the best thing I've tried. My wife has been more diverse: she's had one of the baked potatoes (meh) and the spaghetti (also meh). It's not that the food is bad here, it's just unremarkable. We'll go back. My kid likes the place and there are plenty of things I haven't tried yet. One of these days I will actually try one of their beers (hard to mess that up).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=220,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.8280000000000003,3.5200000000000005
236,Brooke E.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,71,17.0,2.0,2012-06-30,"This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location: My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy.  Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.6960000000000006,3.5200000000000005

The on-line ordering is easy as can be.  A great time saver for lunch on the run.  It's always ready when they say it will be and tastes just as good as when dining in the restaurant.

143,Michelle H.,"Mesa, AZ",59,26,,1.0,2012-07-21,"I've been here on three different occasions. I usually enjoy in-house, micro-brew so that was the draw for me. However, I'd rate their beer better then an average tap bar but for a micro-brewery, it has pretty low points. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for the beer again.  This place is kinda a bar/restaurant, trying to appeal to beer drinkers and family diners at the same time.It's a large, high ceiling dining area that does not distinguish restaurant from bar.  The result is a large, noisy, brightly lit cavern that I found too busy and over-stimulating.  While there, my friend and I ordered drinks but we were coerced into a meal, mostly because the staff was constantly on us to order some food. On our last visit, the waiter asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted something to eat, no joke. When we finally ordered, he let up just until we finished our food. Then it was a constant interruption from him asking if we want anything else, sort of making us feel like we should not take up a table any longer if we're done eating. This was not one time, this is every time I've been there. Even sitting at the bar we got continually pestered into getting something more. The staff seems to be very high strung, sort of  like they drank 5 cups of coffee.  As for the food, I found it highly forgettable, in fact, I don't even remember what I ate. It's just as all well because I won't be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=180,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.6600000000000006,3.4000000000000004

I also like the minestrone soup (a tad on the salty side though) and their wedge salad is really good -- also pretty decadent, drenched in blue cheese and dressing.  They make their own root beer which is amazing!   For dessert, you HAVE to go with the Pizookie!  They expanded their flavor list so there are even more tempting choices.  If you're dining alone or feeling bad about all the fatty pizza you scarfed down, they have a smaller/personal size Pizookie AND if you can't decide on one flavor, you can do halfsies.  Pretty great!

98,Amy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1370,357,15.0,1.0,2014-02-13,"For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad.  Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with ""turkey."" Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The ""turkey"" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my ""cucumber"" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo) She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the ""Cobb salad"" off our bill, and we went on our merry way.  My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land. I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again.

Unlike other places in the area they have there own craft beers, but actually carry selections that would compete with there own so as consumers we have excellent choices here.  I personally like the Parana Pale Ale which is there own.   My wife and I sit in the bar area so are adopted (not really she's a Gator Fan...

I had the pulled pork sandwich, it was good.  The highlight of the evening was our server. It took quite awhile to get our food but we didn't complain. The server took it upon himself to talk to his manager and we ended up with a free salted caramel pizzookie  (I don't know how to spell that). It was tasty!

About 5 minutes later, which is actually quite a bit for this item, a bus boy brought out the strings, not very hot. Then about 5 minutes after that, Cynthia brought out strings, which actually were hot. No excuse, no reason provided.

123,Lindsey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,11,7.0,5.0,2015-04-20,"We had such a great experience I had to share.  We were seated within 5-10 minutes which was the expectation that the hostess set upon giving her my name.   This is the first time I had ever been to a BJ's.  The menu is quite large.  I will say tho, they were advertising the Committed IPA on draft, advertising it on the table.  I got excited!  When I went to order the IPA  I was told they were out.   That's annoying no matter what restaurant is involved.  DO NOT advertise a product, ESPECIALLY on the table being the first thing I see before the menu, and then not have it to sell me.    I also understand that this tends to happen in the restaurant business so no docked points for that here!  We had the Carne Asada french fri appetizer concoction.  It was delicious and perfect for 2 people to share.  We also had the Chicken Tacos and the Puled pork Sammich  ( hahaha love you Matt ) with the wedge fries aka HUGE FRENCH FRIES.  Both delicious.  I decided to order the Top Shelf Margarita with and extra shot on the side, due to the general weakness of the Margaritas made now a days.  Well... the margarita was really bad. I could BARLEY taste the Tequila!  I happened to see the manager  ""DAVID"" who had stopped by and introduced himself earlier. I expressed my concern and he personally went and made me a new margarita. I personally think that the recipe for this particular margarita is being served in too big of a glass and the measurements are out of whack. Top Shelf means Premium liquors, EXPENSIVE.  I think the drink was around $10.  For $10 I better taste more than sour mix in the margarita.  It was disappointing but expected to a point because of my habit of ordering a shot on the side to throw in it.  This particular recipe NEEDS to be RE CREATED.  After David re made the Top Shelf Margarita it was still too sweet I barley could taste the tequila ( hence the shot on the side ). So really I spent around $18 on a margarita ( quite ridiculous ). I was however very impressed with David's customer service and impeccable personality and ability to makes us smile and have a great time.  David also helped us figure out dessert to take home.  Let me let you in on a secret.... shhhhhhhhhh.....  They will special make your cookie dessert!  We got 1/2  macadamia 1/2 salted carmel!  We were treated like gold not only by David but also Kim.  Kim was very patient with us and informative.  She made great suggestions and always had a smile on her face as well as a great attitude.  We were presented with the ""BJ's Premier Rewards Loyalty Program"" by David when we were wrapping up the meal.  I signed up and we will be returning.  There are ALOT of things to try on this menu and they have TONS of good beer on tap and in the bottle.  If you like Micro Brews and strong, weird beer that you can't get just anywhere, give BJ's a shot.  They've got a nice selection.   I give them a 5 star because of the way we were treated, the great time we had because of the treatment, the more than generous and friendly staff, the atmosphere was awesome ( Dim lighting and comfortable ) we were sat quickly in a booth as we requested and the food was delicious.  We walked out of there feeling like a million bucks and VERY WELCOMED BACK!   Thanks guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=120,3.68,3.45,3.45,2.7079999999999997,3.5420000000000003

My hubby noticed that his wedge fries were also overdone this time round. I took a few bites out of my burger and left all my wedge fries which are normally scarfed up first thing. I left a whole burger on my plate. I said WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. I do believe it is the way things are said to the cooks in the kitchen. They tork them off with some comment about the food. What should be done, is just put in another order. After the food is checked, THEN the comment can be made about the first order for this customer.

She quoted us a wait time of 1 hour but said she would try to get us seated sooner.  We were seated 30 minutes later- all together.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This will be our new spot for large family dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=100,2.76,3.27,3.27,3.7,3.066

88,Tonya W.,"Mesa, AZ",24,27,3.0,3.0,2015-09-11,"This was our first time at this chain & we were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere & the menu selection. We were happy with the flavor of the hand crafted cream soda & impressed that it was served in chilled mugs (like A&W used to do before all the ones near us went out of business). We arrived for lunch around 2pm on a Friday afternoon & it was not too busy but also not empty.  We noticed the prices were surprisingly less expensive than Applebee's (all you can eat soup & salad for $7.95 compared to Applebees which is $9.99 & we had a bad experience at the Gilbert & Baseline location recently & don't plan on returning there) so that was a good sign. As an appetizer we ordered the queso & white corn chips. There was a choice between chili & pork, we chose chili to compare it with Chili's. We enjoyed it more than any other queso we have tried (& we have tried a lot) the problem was there weren't enough chips & I didn't detect a hint of salt on the chips at all. Since there weren't enough chips & no one came to check on us we didn't get to finish the queso as we would have liked because it was good & we were hungry. For lunch my daughters shared: Deep Dish Ravioli (Creamy cheese‑filled ravioli, Italian sausage and pepperoni, layered with BJ's signature five cheese blend, Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. Topped with fresh chopped basil.) which also was served with a garlic knot. When the waitress heard they were sharing she asked if they would like an extra one but they don't eat much so we declined. The waitress was thoughtful enough to bring an extra plate as well. My husband ordered rootbeer wings which were served with celery & ranch. I ordered the BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter (A pulled pork slider and a Jallelujah‑spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin or wedge‑cut seasoned fries, BJ's signature coleslaw garnish and BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale BBQ sauce.) The chicken was well cooked & moist but was served on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy. For $7.95 I thought it was a good price for that much food. We then ordered a salted caramel pizookie with 4 spoons. We waited quite a while for the dessert to be delivered & in that time we had dirty dishes piled on the table in front of us which no one came to remove. Finally my husband took it upon himself to move them to a nearby table AFTER the dessert was served to us & we were having trouble reaching it in the center of the table because of the other plates littering the table (which should have been removed long ago, or at least by the person who served the dessert). Our bill came to $61 which includes 3 entrees, appetizer & dessert plus 4 hand crafted sodas which I find very reasonable. We also signed up for the Rewards Club but I don't much about it yet other than you get 1 point for each dollar you spend.  We definitely plan on going back to try out more menu items & we are hoping the service will be more prompt the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=100,2.72,3.28,3.28,3.436,3.0560000000000005

We came here for dinner and to my surprise, they make their own beer! So this is a two parter. One for food, one for the beer. They have a huge menu. They will have something for everyone. Reason it's only 4 stars is we did have to wait for our waiter longer than normal on several occasions. Also this place wasn't packed. Busy but not packed. Bonus points for they give out little pizza pieces to the guests that are waiting to be seated. Food- starter was the potato skins. Would have preferred they weren't deep fried vs baked. They were tasty and they could have always used more bacon!! Wife had a bacon cheeseburger. Huge burger that's plenty juicy with all the fixings. I had the ribeye with a baked potato and a bowl of clam chowder. Chowder and the potato were very good. No complaints. The ribeye was cooked to my liking (mid rare) but the seasoning was missing. Felt like it was missing a bump from being a really good steak. I will probably get a burger next time I'm here.  Beer- I got a flight of beers. Cost about $7 for 4 of them. This time they are 5oz beers vs the normal 2oz. I got the... Lightswitch Lager- there version of the bud light. But this one is very good, crisp, highly carbonated and clear. Excellent! Harvest Hefeweizen- another great quality beer. Smooth, clean, went down way too easy. Would get a pint of this any day. Jeremiah Red- surprise of the night! Malty and sweet. Has just amount of kick on the taste buds to wanting more. Well made quality beer. PM Porter- I'm a sucker for porters and this didn't disappoint. Smooth, fragrant, great mouth feel. Well made Porter. This place knows their beers. Period. Can't wait to return and try the other craft brews on the menu.

We know all the managers all the waiters and waitresses except for one manager and of all of those we have a very good relationship with. We've always enjoyed the service and the food and on occasion we might have an order that's not right but no big deal. Tonight was different, I have never been so frustrated as I was tonight. I ordered an Asian salad which they are making it differently now than what they used to. The salad was so wilted I couldn't eat it and I finally just gave up. When the waiter came back to my table I never said anything and I never complained but my friends brought it up and told him that that the salad was so bad that I just couldn't eat it. So the waiter apologized and said that he would go talk to the manager because there was only like maybe one quarter of the salad that have been eaten. It was obvious that there was a problem with the salad. So the manager comes which by the way is one of the managers that I don't know personally, and he gives me this excuse that the reason why the salad looks like that is because the chicken is warm and it makes the salad look like that. But that wasn't the reason why. The chicken wasn't even warm when they brought it to my table for one thing. And then it was obvious that the salad was not wilted  because of the chicken, it was wilted because it was just bad salad. So he apologizes and then he leaves. So my waiter comes back to the table and asked me if the manager had come to the table and asked me if the manager had  spoken to me and I said yes. And he asked me what  he said and I told him that nothing was ever mentioned about not charging me for the food. So he leaves to go find out what he is supposed to do and he is told by the manager that he explained it to me and that was good enough. The waiter felt really bad and was put in a bad position because he knows that we come in there all the time and I could tell that he felt very awkward. So on  the way out I have a few Choice words to say to the manager and he looks at me and says ""What! I was going to give you your money back"" . But that's not the way it was at all. He had a chance and he didn't do it and then all of a sudden he's trying to make it look like he had every intention to give me my money back. Needless to say I was pretty ticked. We have never been treated like that before at that restaurant And let me just say that our waiter was great.   We could tell that he felt bad about the situation and he even offered to pay for desert but I declined.   It was not his fault.

60,S.Ellen B.,"Mesa, AZ",13,50,44.0,2.0,2016-06-19,"Horrible eating experience. Our server didn't care. The place wasn't crowded, but our server acted overworked and it took us ages to get drinks. After we got drinks, it took even longer before she came back to take our orders. We sat with our empty drinks, waiting to order and waiting for refills for an absurd amount of time. Our server didn't resurface until we asked another nearby server for refills - this lady seemed to be able to handle her six tales just fine, but our server couldn't handle two. Finally we got our orders in and she asks if we want refills. Are you kidding me? Of course we do - its just diet soda! Drinks were brought to us while nearby tables were being bussed - as in, dirty plates were put on pause, our glasses fetched, then the bussing resumed. We finally noticed there was a party of some kind with the servers and buss-boys in the other section of the restaurant. We watched as our server sat with friends and ate for a bit while we waited for our food and, again, went without refills. Bussers sat dirty plates on clean tables, next to the clean glasses and whatnot, which was totally inappropriate. When we did get refills, our server never took any glasses away, so our take got really crowded... especially when the food finally came. I very nearly started sitting glasses on the clean table next to us, because hey, thats what the bussers did. Our orders were wrong, but our server never came back to ask how our food was. My sister's burger was not cooked to order, all my sides were incorrect, and we were starving. My sis sent hers back (took another twenty minutes to get it corrected). I didn't bother asking about my sides, because I knew I might never see any food at all if I sent it back to the kitchen. I'm surprised my sister did. We begged another refill off another server and didn't see our server again until she dropped off the check.  The only reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server did take my sister's meal off the check since it had been incorrect. Unfortunately.... I have a feeling she did it not because the meal had been wrong, but because she suddenly realized with her terrible service, we wouldn't be tipping.  Overall, horrible service. Food was only mediocre, but to be fair to the chefs in the back, we might have been tainted by the bad experience.

Finally we order,  one of our party is a pescetarian and asks for salmon, they are out if salmon.  She asks what  pescetarian friendly dishes  they offer and the waitress who was vegan recommended that shrimp dish.  So now all salads are delivered however we still have no flatware we asked two different people for silverware and it wasn't until our waitress came to the table to see how are salads were that she realized we couldnt eat therm.   Next comes the food.  The shrimp dish smells like chicken.   We ask them to check and found that the dish was made with chicken stock.  Our server cane to the table apologetic.   She asked if she could bring something else.  We asked for the stuffed mushrooms, the server  rushed it however they still did not get to the table until we were done with the rest of the meals.

And, it seems the serving size is always more than double the ""half rack"" size.  Clam chowder is done well. Tomato and mozzarella salad is very good. Skip the Caeser. Fries are cooked well done and salted to the point to motivate beer sales. Broccoli is hit or miss and can be unripe. I'll never order the asparagus again - wilted and the tips where brown. I commented several times to the server but she never picked up on it. Ribs are usually cooked well and the BBQ sauce is excellent. Sometimes the meat is overcooked and, with the sauce basted on, can be caramelized to rock hard. The Pizzookies are always wonderful. This place is a worthy venture.

10,Brian H.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,39,9.0,3.0,2017-12-09,"Beer and desserts are great.  Food is hit and miss and the servers are very nice but if they are busy you will definitely be pressured to order quickly and then get the heck out.  Pork chop looked amazing but was significantly underdone and underseasoned as well.  Steak on my left ordered medium rare was blood rare, sent back twice and gave up.  Stick with the burgers and you will be much happier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa,3.8,3.56,3.56,,3.656
8,Jason P.,"Chandler, AZ",7,19,13.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"I took several of my Co workers here for some appetizers and a few drinks, with 6 of us... all laughing and having a great time. We had a total tab of $150. Including $60 of appetizers.... we had been there 55 minutes and the manager, a very young and inexperienced guy decided that he should cut us off, simply because we were being loud in the bar area.   We were not intoxicated, we were laughing and making jokes.  Of all the times I have been to a restaurant, and or bar. This was by far the worst call ever made by a manager on duty.   Luckily we were very close to a place called RTO Sullivan's.  We went there and had a great time.  BJ's ....You had an epic failure on Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa,3.64,3.52,3.52,,3.5680000000000005
