77,Nonya M.,"Mesquite, TX",46,34,,4.0,2012-03-16,"Based on my experience last night I would give it a full 5 stars, however, trying to not be biased I will give it four total.  We sat in the bar area close to closing time.  Surprisingly, the waitress was really nice and attentive although we came in an hour until close.  This is rare since normally waiters have issues when you are one of the last ones.  The main eating area was closed or we would have sat there instead.  It all worked out well though as the bar was roomy and felt more private. I ordered my favorite water and lime mixture and my hubbs had the D.P.  I tried it out and instead of the normal flat soda pop we get most other places, it was refreshingly bubbly and the right amount of syrup.  This is always a nice sign of the quality.  We thought of ordering the fried artichoke appetizer but passed.  I have had these before and they are wonderful.   It took awhile for us to decide but after ordering some bad ones in the past we had narrowed it down.  By the way, I am not a fan of the bacon/mac or the tomato soup and I will say the tacos I got in the past were small. We did order two entrees the Skirt Steak Salad and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  My husband skipped the balsamic dressing and subbed in cesar.  I had the white cheddar mashed potatoes and green beans.  Excellent choices as we were both overly pleased with the taste.  We tried a bite of each others meal and agreed it was the best we have had at the place.  If you like the Costeletta from Cheescake Factory then you will like the Parm. Chicken here.  The steak was very tender and full of flavor served medium by default I believe. Back to the service, we were exceptionally pleased with the attitude and attentiveness so much that we told the manager.  Overall we had a great experience that night.  In the past it has not always been excellent but this time it deserved a 5 star rating.  Taking everything into consideration I left it with 4 stars for the many times I have been to reflect on the total experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=60,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
88,Tracy D.,"Forney, TX",46,15,,4.0,2012-03-17,"My husband and I went there last night for dinner and we enjoyed it. I wasn't crazy about the appetizer (we got the sampler and found out it was for four people, not two, so we brought a lot home), but the Iced Tea was really good! My husband ordered the Jambalaya. He said it was different - he's from New Orleans - but liked it enough to order it again. It was VERY spicy though. I did notice some sweating, not that he'd admit it! I got the Parmesan Chicken. It was awesome! The chicken was so tender I didn't need a knife, and it melted in my mouth. I got two huge pieces. The sauce was a bit too lemon-y, but there wasn't a whole lot of it, so it wasn't overpowering. The mashed potatos were very good, but I didn't get much broccoli. It looked more like garnish than a serving size. Service, on the other hand, was just ""meh."" When we walked in, we were greeted by some overly cheerful, Pollyanna types that reminded me of Disneyland. I kept expecting them to say, Have a Magical Day! But they didn't. It was a nice change though, many other places have greeters that don't even smile.  Our server was nice, but not around much. We didn't get refills on our drinks until we were about ready to leave. It took awhile just to place our order, and after ordering our drinks we thought he forgot about us. He kept saying sorry, that he had so many other tables. I wanted to say, So? Not my problem. But instead I said it with a 15% tip (we usually give 20% or more).  So yeah, we'll go back, but it won't be on top ten list. Especially around Christmas... the parking situation at the mall is just awful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006
68,Rachel J.,"Dallas, TX",46,14,,4.0,2012-08-07,"Went there for the second time on a date last night.  Hostess wasn't the most engaging, but she sat us quickly and gave the standard upsell on steaks and seasonal beer. The service was GREAT.  Our server was funny, attentive without being pushy, and just really on the ball.  My birthday is Friday, but she saw that it was coming up when she carded us for drinks.  And without prompting, she brought out a small cookie and ice cream with a candle!!  (and two spoons)  :)  So sweet! Moz sticks were good.  Plenty of them and not too greasy.  Great to share. My date got the ribs and it was the biggest thickest rack of ribs either of us had ever seen.  He really enjoyed them and still had plenty to take home. I got the loaded giant baked potato but asked if they could add shredded bbq pork.  They said sure and it came out exactly like I had hoped.  And when they say giant, they MEAN IT.  I had massive leftovers as well Both times I've been I've had a mixed drink and they don't skimp on the booze either.  Just sayin'.   Overall solid experience.  Will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=60,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

I had never been to a BJ's in all my travels coast to coast so I decided to pop into this location while on a recent trip to visit family.  It's attached to Town East Mall. I wasn't too stoked about that idea, but it appears they built this restaurant onto the mall so there was plenty of space, acceptable amount of tv's for sports, and of course beer. While I didn't try the beer on this trip, the food was above my expectations. Chicken tortilla soup was good!  Also had the turkey club sammich and the wedge fries.

80,Michelle M.,"Madison, AL",0,5,,4.0,2012-11-25,"BJ's is a good place to go when your in the mood for classic casual American food and good beer. They have great burgers and salads and a nice appetizer and small plate selection. The California burger is awesome; it is served on sourdough with avocado. BJ's is one of the few chain restaurants that doesn't overcook their burgers. A medium is actually pink! Favorite appetizers include avocado eggrolls, flatbread pizzas and fried artichokes. Their dinner salads are huge and they go really well with a couple small plates if you want to make a family style meal.  This location is attached to the Town East mall. Parking can be an issue when the mall gets busy. The restaurant itself is large, it's usually busy but typically does not have a long wait. It has a upscale sports bar feel, there are TVs throughout playing various games.  The microbrews are very good and are a good price. I usually order the BJ's beer but they have a respectable selection of other beers. The brown reminds me of a Newcastle.  The stout is a little too bitter for my taste but the porter is very nice. It is dark with a hint of coffee.

Fries were good. Honey mustard was different than I expected, but ok. Ordered a hopdaddy IPA because well, it is a brewhouse after all. Nice smooth IPA bite. Nothing special.

I love knowing that there won't be line for a table or a busy bar with no seats. I usually don't go crazy with my food. I stick with ordering the same thing at every restaurant but with BJ's I am never afraid to try something new.

I also ordered the Watermelon and Feta salad as it is only available seasonally. It used to be better tasting. Our waitress was good about re-filling our drinks but her food runner brought out my husband's salad maybe a couple of minutes before the main course was brought out and brought my salad out at the same time as well which was to be part of my main course which I promptly informed him and sent it back until the time was right which was only a couple of minutes later. My son had the gourmet mac and cheese which was good and my husband had the Bison burger. His only complaint was that the burger had at least an inch or two worth of lettuce on it which made it difficult for him to put his mouth around the burger to bite it. The crispy calamari was good as always but had an unfortunate grease after-taste on several pieces. Not sure if these issues were because we went there on a different day than we usually do.

My last issue was that the waiter brought only 4 spoons for 7 of us to use (I knew the economy is going through a rough time, but really??). Conclusion: I wouldn't be as upset if I saw them taking initiative to improve, but they remain unchanging in their quality of  service, and continue to keep customers upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.468,3.3200000000000003

81,Erica D.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,40,6.0,1.0,2015-06-17,"Went to this restaurant for the first time ever with a very large group of 80. Keep that in mind because I am very aware the service is different from small parties. So how many waiters do you think they would have on a Monday about 1:00 for a party of 80? 2! Yes 2 lonely waiters for our event. This was a reserved party so I am not sure why only 2 people. The rest of the place was only half full and nobody waiting to be seated. It took over 30 minutes just to get my starter salad of mozzarella and tomatoes. The entire meal took 1 1/2 hours and we were lucky because we flagged down the waiter to just get service. First off, my salad was half the size as two other people who got the same dish. Really? You didn't charge me half the price so I did not understand that. I ordered a mini pizza. It took 45 minutes to get that. It was ice cold by the time I got it. Not a single refill on my soda. I would like to think the food is good, but I cant say for sure because mine was cold and the salad was 4 bite fulls. Now I find it funny it only took 5 minutes for the waiter to bring me my bill and charge my card. That was the fastest part of the whole trip. I dont live around that area but I will be trying the BJ's by my house. I dont recommend for a larger party. But I am willing to give another location a chance to see if the food is good.

Don't even waste your time.  We arrived about 1:00pm on a Saturday afternoon. We came in through the outside entrance not the interior mall entrance. The music was so loud that you couldn't hear a word the hostess said. I 'assumed' she asked us how many we had for our table. We watched her look at something and gather menus. Then we saw her say something to us and we blindly followed her to a table. We sat down. After about 5 minutes, a waiter arrives and gets our drink order. He seemed nice enough but that took a little bit. We ordered alcohol so luckily he brought our waters first because the bar drinks took awhile too. We order guacamole and chips as an appetizer size it was well after lunch and we hadn't eaten all day.  A food runner happened to bring out our appetizer. I asked her ""doesn't this come with salsa""? She rudely said ""I don't think so but I don't read the menu.""  I read her the menu since we had not yet ordered our food yet.  She walked away from me and said ""I don't know the menu. I'll tell your waiter."" A few minutes later out comes a salsa.  My fiancée ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which was good. I ordered a combo with a garden salad and stuffed baked potato with garden vegetable with no cheese. When mine arrived the potato has a white sauce on it. When I asked the waiter he said it was Alfredo. I said I asked for no cheese. He said I know but that's Alfredo. I said I know Alfredo is half cheese and cream and I cannot eat dairy. He took it away. Another was brought and it looked like they had picked off the cheese on another. I didn't care I was over it at this point. SO DONE! The guacamole was tasteless and bland. The fire-roasted salsa was good at least. Not spicy but decent. If you want bad service, loud music, people who don't listen to anything you want, and just okay food.  Go here!

Although once notified of the spill the staff was quick to try to clean up the mess, but no apology was given.

Great beers and Cakes loved the Margaritas. Waiter was attentive and friendly. We ordered the Personal Size Pizza for the Happy Hour half price special. Atmosphere was great, spacious dining and bar, looked like we had found our new Happy Hour hang out. Wrong, SO why do I only give it three stars. Well when we finally got our food, I had the Parmesan Chicken, they were tough and the vegetables were cool or like they had been sitting around waiting on the rest to come out. A minute later they bring us our appetizer Pizza after the main courses. That was not cool. So Cakes ordered the Chicken Alfredo and she loved it. Tried it and it was hot and delicious. We get our bill and think Hmm that seems high but pay it and leave. Tipped the waiter a little extra even though the appetizer foul up, not his fault. Get home and check out the bill, they charged us full price on the appetizer and did not take off the $10 coupon, Come on - what kind of deal breaker is that?

I got the Peruvian quinoa plate (something like that) with chicken. It was pretty tasty but towards the end, as I made my way to bottom of the plate, it was a bit too lemony; however my chicken was cooked to perfection! My bf got some salmon dish and he liked the glaze on the salmon but the couscous had a weird texture. That's not the restaurant's fault though we've both never had couscous before- it's probably supposed to be gooey.

That's what happens when you have a menu that's too big. That's another thing I don't understand. Their menu is extremely sporadic and has no real concept or direction.

Unfortunately, things only went downhill from there. 1) My Oktoberfest beer never made it to the table. 2) We received our appetizers from server assistants and were not given app plates nor did we receive a timely check back (which came after we finished our apps).  3) One in our party received her entree with the appetizers (a soup and salad). The soup was cold by the time the rest of our entrees arrived about 8 or so minutes later. Also, the server assistant needed my help because she was holding five plates with no tray. 4) Remaining entrees were brought out by assistant servers who attempted to hand a very hot plate to a child at our table. The server ended up reaching across the table to only place the hot plate in the middle of the table and simply nudged it in the direction of my niece. No check on quality of entrees and no offer of condiments. After another 5 to 10 minutes I got up and grabbed condiments from an unbussed table. Our server did not check back for about 10 minutes. All this on a relatively slow Friday night. Our section only had a handful of 3 to 4 tops, making the whole experience more annoying. 5) A manager walked by twice looking stressed without checking in on tables or greeting guests. 6) Kitchen did a good job. 8/10 with a few details missing but solid food overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
