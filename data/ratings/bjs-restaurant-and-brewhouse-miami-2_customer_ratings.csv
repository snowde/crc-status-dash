156,Gaby S.,"Miami, FL",757,328,153.0,5.0,2012-11-11,"I am definitely pleased to say that bj's is a great addition to the falls. Ive had the pleasure of coming here twice already, they are fairly new and just opened but dont let that fool you. The restaurant is very nice. Great place to watch any upcoming football or basketball games. There are tv's practically everywhere so you dont have to worry about a good seat. Beautiful bar & great service. Ive only come here for appetizers, beer and dessert so i cant review the entrees. The buffalo chicken wontons are delish and so are the avocado eggrolls and spinach dip They have a great beer selection to choose from- try the nutty brunette- very good!  And lets not forget about the dessert. Beignets or the pizookie are both delicious! So save some room for dessert and decided which guilty pleasure you'd rather go for ;) PS- Make sure to sign up for their rewards card if you plan on coming back. You get points for every dollar spent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=160,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548
207,Cathy C.,"Miami, FL",1,9,1.0,3.0,2012-11-16,They just opened so we'll give them another chance.  The house beer was excellent and the service was very good.  The food was meh however and the noise level was uncomfortably loud.  The acoustics are so bad that everyone in the packed place is yelling which perpetuates the problem.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=260,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252
158,Jay S.,"Miami, FL",2,23,,2.0,2012-11-18,"Just opened, ordered appetizers came out very quickly. I ordered ""Country Fried CHICKEN Steak"" upon cutting the Chicken Steak I realize there is no ""chicken"" but instead steak. I figured with the word ""Chicken"" in the title of the item it's safe to assume there will be chicken in it, had it simply been called a ""Country Fried Steak"" there would be no issue.  Waiter was very nice and took the item back and I ordered the wings instead, after waiting 30 mins nothing either they forgot place the order or something, but at this point I was annoyed and asked to cancel my order and just get the check.  Waiter told me he would bring me the check we waited almost most 25 mins to get the check and the excuse we get was he needed a manger to remove it.  In my head I'm thinking it shouldn't take that long.   The part that surprised me was when I spoke to a manger passing by our table I asked her why my food was taking so long and rather then addressing or even offering any kind of apology she told me she would get my server, I guess so much for customer service. You would figure with this place newly opened they would at least try to make a better effort..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=160,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

When he later returned with another bowl, he blamed us for the spill. The other servers heard what this jerk said and mentioned it to the manager who finally came over to apologize when we were finished with our meal.

We had the smattering of appetizers from:  * Margherita Fresca = If you like the Margherita pizza's you will enjoy. * Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage = another good choice * Buffalo boneless chicken = a bit too much sauce.   Our main's were good as well I ordered the Grilled Pork Chops with the cheddar mashed potatoes & green beans.

162,Lissete D.,"Miami, FL",283,558,220.0,3.0,2013-01-03,"I'm still on the fence about this one. We went on New Year's Day. The wait time was quoted as 25 minutes, but it actually took less. Staff is friendly and our server was efficient albeit a bit rushed.  Our appetizers were served and we still had not received napkins or silverware. The noise level is really high. We had to repeat our orders a couple of times because our server could not hear us.  Table conversation was a bit difficult as well. The temperature in the restaurant kept fluctuating from comfortable to freakin' cold! I saw several people get up and come back with jackets, so I was not the only one feeling it. Now, for the food. The menu has tons of great sounding options. We opted for the spinach artichoke dip and the Bruschetta to start. The dip was served hot with fresh chips. It tasted good but not Hillstone good. The tiny bruschetta bites were good as well, (you really can't screw that up) and it was served with a pesto-y dipping sauce. Our entrees consisted of Chix Fried Steak (very peppery), the BBQ Chix Deep Dish Pizza (nice crust, but sauce was super spicy) and the grilled burger melt. The burger was good but the bottom bread was very soggy, which led me to believe that it had been sitting for a while. They have 2 options for fries, thin cut and seasoned steak fries. Both were good, my preference is the thin cut though. Nothing was served greasy, so they got points for that. Finally, dessert. We chose the Pizookie trio, which was served 20 minutes after ordering! After 15 we asked our server about the delay. she told us that they are baked when ordered, so it usually takes a while. it would have been nice if this had been mentioned before we ordered.  The trio consists of.... wait for it... THREE cookies topped with ice cream. They are served in the baking tins and look like I could have made it in my old easy bake oven.  Now for the Goldilocks moment. One was perfect, one was hard, and the other one was too soft, and probably undercooked. But the ice cream was good. We will probably give them another shot. Try different menu items though. I would definitely choose them over TGIFriday's, but there are other choices in the immediate area. Oh, my husband did not like their IPA but their sampler is a good deal. I think it was a sampler of (8) 5 oz samples for $14. Maybe next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=120,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

Our avocado egg rolls tasted like they'd soaked in a hot tub of oil all day long. In fact, it kinda tasted like oil used to fry pork...either that or BJ's is the first to engineer meat-flavored avocados. Weird. Next, my sister and I ordered the Maui porkchop which came with green beans and roasted potatoes and the Enlightened Thai Mango Chicken Salad. The salad was hearty and refreshing and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun twist on greens...but  the porkchop was bland. Stay away.

Also, very light cheese, way to skimpy on the cheese for my taste.  All in all this place is fun to go for maybe  to watch a game or with a large crowd. Great beer selection as well and good service.

It later took 20 minutes to remove the item from the bill. This occurred on a Wednesday evening, and it wasn't even busy.  My last visit there, I went with three friends for beers and some snacks on a Friday night. After waiting 45 minutes, I was hoping the service would be good. Yet, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us. Once we all placed our drink orders, it took another 10 minutes for us to get them.

133,Nichole M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",47,27,6.0,2.0,2013-07-11,"Came here with my family on a Thursday night for my grandmother's birthday. We got sat in a really uncomfortable half-booth which made it really hard to get in and out for bathroom breaks. Which didn't make much sense considering when we got there there was a wide open section where they could have easily put us without us all being on top of each other. We only had one waitress taking care of our 15-top. She didn't write ANYTHING down. Needless to say a lot if orders were messed up. My sister and I were sitting at one end of the table and had ordered the ahi poke as an appetizer for us while the rest of the table had egg rolls and cheese sticks. Except, it was long after the server cleaned up the other appetizers when we could finally flag her down. It's a raw tuna dish. It shouldn't take that long. Then came out orders. I don't know about everyone else, but I had the pot roast. The reason I chose the pot roast over a steak was because it came with roasted veggies as a side. It just so happens that I love roasted veggies. My vegetables were literally mirepoix. Chunks of raw onion, raw celery, and raw carrots that looked like they'd seen an oven for maybe 5 seconds. I say raw because when I bit into a carrot, it was hard and COLD. I would have said something to our server, but we barely saw her.  The desserts were good. Very rich. My sister and I shared a pizookie trio.  The problem with the food though, aside from them clearly not knowing what ""roasted"" means, was that every single person in our party went home and got sick that night - by definition a food born illness.  But for me probably the WORST part about the experience was that as we were leaving, the server had the balls to pick up the check book, open it, and then smile and thank my uncle (who by the way didn't pay).  As someone who has worked in almost every position in both front and back of house in restaurants and hotels - I have to say I think it is rude, tacky, and shows an extreme lack of class.  I'm glad you like your tip, maybe next time you'll actually earn it.  I would honestly give this place no stars if I could, plus one for the dessert.

Problem #1 After waiting 20 minutes, I had to find a waitress just to take our drink order.  Our drink order came quickly but once again, we had to find our waitress once again to check on our appetizer.  Apparently, socializing with her friends was more important than customer service.   25 minutes later, our appetizer came with an excuse....the cooks ""screwed up"" the order and to ""be careful because the food is really hot"".  I found this rather funny because the food had obviously been sitting under a hot lamp for quite some time.   The appetizer was cold and no sooner when we picked up our forks, the entree came.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the mistake was not the cooks but our server.  We complained to the manager that our appetizer was cold and we were promised that it would be taken off the bill and a fresh appetizer would be out in 5 minutes.  Some people have no concept of time and 27 minutes later, we received our appetizer.  On a positive note, the burgers that we did order were much improved from the first visit, and the appetizer was not charged to our bill.  I almost forgot, don't go expecting a refill on your drink.  Not once did the waitress ask if we needed one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=260,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.988,2.36

I asked for cold glasses and he put ice in them which was good but glasses came full of water from melted ice which we had to pour out. On the food side calamari was ok. Main courses were average at best. Baby back ribs were good but baked potato was tiny and almost no toppings even though we asked for loaded. Steak was cooked right but white cheddar potatoes tasted like pre-frozen and heated. Cheeseburger was missing cheese and we sent back...came with a small patch of cheese in center of bun, most places at least try to have cheese size of burger patty.

Unfortunately, our waitress Sara took the happy out of happy hour, as she had a nasty attitude and provided the slowest service I've ever experienced! I am assuming it's because after sitting for a while with no service, I jokingly asked a very pleasant server that was helping the table next to us, to be our waiter. I said that before I even met her, so it was nothing personal. And truthfully, if she was so bothered by my request, she should have had someone else take our table! On top of her crappy attitude, she didn't know what was discounted during happy hour, so we decided to order away based on what the hostess told us, and just handle any discreptancies at the end. To start with, we ordered two glasses of wine, the Santa Fe spring rolls, and the stuffed mushrooms. Both appetizers were awesome. After asking someone to track down Sara, we were able to order another round of drinks and appetizers. I ordered my favorite Belgian beer (Lindeman's Framboise) and my friend ordered another glass of the wine she started with. Sara seemed upset that she didn't ask for the wine by its name and quickly corrected her! I'm not making this up! lol Anyway, we ignored her and continued ordering... We got the corn fritters with bacon aioli, avocado egg rolls and the California club flatbread pizza. The pizza was delish, however the avocado egg rolls and the corn fritters were flavorless. My friend wanted to order a third glass of wine, but Sara was again, unavailable!  At the end of our meal, I presented Sara with a ""coupon"" the valet attendant gave me so she could take $5 off the check. She made up her face and seemed bothered, so I asked her if the coupon was unfamiliar to her. She stated it wasn't, so I'm not sure what the face was for. I'm thrilled that the Falls has decided to provide ""free"" valet to those that patronize certain restaurants as it can be a challenge to find parking there. Despite the poor service, I enjoyed happy hour at BJ's as we sat on the patio and soaked up the beautiful weather while indulging in great conversation. Before we left, I let the manager know about the horrible service, so he could let Sara know why she got a measly 14% tip.  This was my second visit to BJ's, (the first was much better) so I will give it one more try. If the service is like this again, I'm done!

We ordered the vegetable flat and even that was poorly presented and very few vegetables, almost as if they were running out of condiments. My girl loves her GUINNESS with a beautiful head, chilled and thick consistency. Her beer was water very diluted. The restaurant was nice to take it off the bill, they told her that was the bottom of the keg. We also ordered cheesy spinach and artichoke stuffed mushroom caps. They were great tasting but the chef seems not to pay attention to detail and has o consistency in the kitchen. Some of the mushrooms were flat, lacked cheese, artichoke and spinach and some were perfect, there was no consistency and some were not appealing to the eye even though they tasted ok, some were better than others.

236,Lissette M.,"Miami, FL",53,2,,1.0,2014-05-31,"My boyfriend and I had been here once before, and other than having a bit of a clueless waiter, our experience was fairly pleasant. However, this time around, our experience was anything but pleasant. We went with a friend to watch a Heat game last night, and we were unhappy at being seated outside without being told that the outdoor TVs had no volume. We were obviously there to watch a Heat playoff game, and should have been advised of the volume issue. Every other restaurant I've been to has had no problem accommodating the customer when unhappy with their table and has done everything possible to resolve the issue. However, the hostesses and manager here, I believe his name was Pierre or something to that effect, were completely useless. Even though there was an empty booth, they refused to move us to it and wanted to put us back on a ridiculously long waiting list. It would have been simple for them to move us to the indoor booth and place the next person on the list at our previous table, seeing as how we were there first. However, this was apparently too much to ask. While I admit to becoming agitated and using a cuss word or two toward the sorry excuse for a manager, it shouldn't have had to escalate to that point, because our request should have been properly and quickly handled. The manager even threatened to ask me to leave, so I did. We went next door to Friday's. Even though we had been on their list earlier and left to BJ's, the hostesses at Friday's were wonderful and quickly accommodating. They promptly found us a table where we were able to enjoy the food and the game. What a difference! Needless to say, with so many better dining options with much better service in the area, I will never set foot into BJ's again. All I can say is learn how to treat your customers!

232,Martha M.,"Miami, FL",2,6,,2.0,2014-07-01,"BJ's is essentially an over priced Chili's, or TGI Friday's. The restaurant is big, and the bar looks fabulous. The service was good. I went on a Friday night after seeing a movie at The Falls movie theater. The ladies at the hostess desk were not very welcoming and were more interested in having their own private conversation. Although it was a Friday night, we were seated right away. I ordered the shrimp pasta. I figured you can not go wrong with pasta. Well I was wrong, there was so much oil in the pasta, you could see a pool of oil at the bottom of the plate, and they put melted cheese on top, it looked like a big glob of pasta. I guess I did not fully read the description following the item on the menu, where they mentioned cheese...I have to say that the portion was huge. I only was able to eat about a quarter of it, before I was full. My husband ordered the parmesan encrusted chicken, with mash potatoes. He said both the chicken, and the mash potatoes were bland. I was debating whether to order any of their ""brews"", but decided not too, since it was already past my bed time!! For about 6 dollars they have a small sample of five of their beers, which I will try next time.

I have to say that i've had a positive experience every time i've gone, though I have heard a few mixed reviews from friends and family members. The times i've gone, service was always attentive and on point. The atmosphere is always vibrant and their bar scene is very active.  I've had their pizzas twice, deep dish. Last night I had the BJ's Favorite. The pizzas are alright. I would rate the pizzas 3 out of 5. They're average. They are not bad but they aren't anything special to write home about. If you want good deep dish pizzas, go to Manhattan Chicago Pizza in Pinecrest.  We also ordered the deep dish lasagna, and I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I would definitely order this again and highly recommend it. The lasagna had a cheesy top layer of mozzarella. It was light on the meat, but it had plenty of ricotta. It had very rich flavors and I was happy with the portion.  I would give it a 5 out of 5.  Their pizookies are always amazing. My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut but they're all frickin good. I order these every time.  In the past I've ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was tasty. I would recommend this dish and give it a 4 out of 5 rating.  My dad has ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon with couscous the last two times he's been at BJ's. So that's a good sign.

We came here on a Thursday night for a late dinner, were seated right away, and our server was spot on and very attentive throughout the meal.  We both ordered steaks (which were a touch on the spicy side), I ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad and fries, my friend had the broccoli and mashed potatoes and both of us were happy with our meals and with our steaks, and we're people who dine at better steakhouses like Graziano's on a semi-regular basis. This place has lots of TVs for watching sports and other programming, has a decent beer and drinks menu and a food menu that offers something to satisfy nearly everyone.

Their web app allows ordering which was convenient, but they didn't actually ""get"" my order until well into an hour after ordering. We had to wait another 30mins. Fine. It's ""new"" technology, so I'll go along with it. Then, once we pick up the food, they ask if I wanted the free garlic knots that came with the order, and I clicked on the web app to get.  (""duh""). So I had to wait another 5-7 min for a regular (not garlic) knot.  Here is the kicker: the turkey burger I ordered was plain without any fixings and the Santa Fe salad was minus the Santa Fe (no dressing).

Appetizer was delivered to the table but no silverware to eat with, the food runner should either ask if we need anything before leaving or bring silverware by just being observant.  I asked for a medium rare burger and got well done with burn marks.  We always specify that we have 2 adults and baby with a stroller, we do this knowing that we don't want to block the aisle of disturb a table that might be too close. They obviously didn't care as they sat us at a couples table and we had to park the stroller in the main aisle. Not comfortable for us nor the baby and I'm sure not for the servers having to get by.

Wine was good, had good food before always went with smaller items like burgers, tacos easy food to not mess up.  Server recommended rib eye $23.00 or ribs $22.00. In these type of places and i mean almost all places that i order big steaks unless your a ""real"" steak house they somehow NEVER are able to cook Medium Rare which is the only way to consume a rib eye with wine. Server was great though, bar area booths, too bad he paid the price for the HUGE errorssss. I always tell the server must be medium rare clearly and no salt since all places over salt, not grey, pink, not overly picky but if you order a steak the only thing u have to do is cook it right. Salads come out, good, was a little chilly out, so ordered soups wife broccoli cheddar just warm not hot but didn't mention it, my clam chowder, good warm not hot, stayed quiet we don't complain about little things,,,, Ribs come out and Server had mentioned they changed recipe or something and they where good no prob. Steak comes out and Boom without cutting meat you can tell  the ""done-ness"" by softly pushing your finger down on it, if its soft, medium rare if its hard and so- on. Of course my steak grey hard well cooked not even medium which i do understand is a fine line. Server came he saw acknowledged i said sorry but i have to, ordered second bottle for upcoming great steak. Wait for it, wait for it, Boom, comes out looks perfect great color, big, soft to the touch for those that just learned you don't have to cut steak to tell, as a matter of fact if u cut it it will bleed....then.... Holy Crap salted to the death so salty i scraped and scraped and salty wine salt wine salt, didn't tell server he would have cried. Manager came by and asked how is it this time. Super Salty I said, He Said "" They tell us to dip and drop in spices both sides and try to get a crust"" Horrible idea they are idiots as to how to cook meat, Servers tip suffered, manager cared less , i shoveled it down and drank a gallon of wine, water and whatever, bogo deal soothed the pain, ouch tongue on fire, kidneys pumping salty stuff out wife was happy, dogs happy bones, good drinks, burger maybe next time,  no STEAK HERE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=100,2.84,2.88,2.88,2.436,2.864

My daughter ordered the kids chicken tenders and I ordered the mahi tacos and brussels sprouts as an appetizer. The brussels sprouts never came but I was pretty full with the entrée itself. The food was not spectacular but it was fresh, flavorful and well portioned.  I can't complain about service as our server was excellent, knowledgable about the menu, friendly, and attentive.

We did call ahead to be placed on the wait list however we still had a wait time when we got there. We were escorted to our table 505 and the service clerk was 16 not to blast any names on yelp. The hostess didn't bring us any utensils and gave us two menus just to share between 5 of us. We ordered two appetizers Avocado egg rolls and calamari. The calamari was cooked well however the avocado egg rolls were under cooked and we had to send them back, what a disappointment. For our entree we ordered a clam chowder soup, spaghetti and meatballs and a flat bread cal club. The flat bread which is suppose to contain chicken barely had a 1/4"" of chicken on each slice. The service was blah as we never got a plate to share from our waiter which we asked twice and told him the kids were sharing their plate. Shortly after we ordered our desserts our waiter brought the bill which was rather rude as we weren't even done yet. This was at 8:02PM. 8:15PM rolled by and the desserts were not at our table yet.

Our food took forever to come, and I don't mind waiting but the quality wasn't as good. I do gotta say we got the buffalo wings and they served us a lot which was surprising for $10. I got the double deluxe burger and I think it was way too much. My boyfriend got the great white deep dish pizza and I had high expectations for it but they were crushed. It had too much garlic and it wasn't shredded they put the little cubes instead- he only ate two slices. The piezokie was ok, but I wouldn't recommend the salted caramel.

The only comment I agree on when it comes to the reviews below me is that the menus were sticky. I'm not sure why, it would be nice if they put 100% effort in wiping them down.. But besides that, our experience was very enjoyable. We (double date) were seated at one of the round booths which was very comfortable! Our waiter was attentive and kind, we started off with drinks, I ordered some mixed drink with raspberries, pineapple and other fruit juices and gin. Strong and fruity. The others at the table ordered wine and beer.  We shared an appetizer of the stuffed mushroom caps, I believe it was an artichoke dip stuffed with a lemon drizzle on top. I plan on trying to make them!! Absolutely packed with flavor and recommended. For my main dish I ordered the deep dish baked ziti which had many bite sized sausages throughout, the sauce wasn't too red, pinkish and very cheesy. *Recommended*  The best part, we wanted to watch a movie afterwards and conveniently if you are eating at the restaurant you have the option to buy movie passes for ONLY $8.50 each!! Easily saving you $10 or more. I'm very happy with our experience, as I believe others are too since whenever I am at The Falls late at night I always seem to see a line of people waiting to be seated.

85,Kristen V.,"Miami Springs, FL",0,8,,2.0,2016-08-02,"I've been to this location a few times and service can be hit or miss. But now when I went the service was so terrible. I'm a server myself so I know the struggle of it but I feel like my waitress saw my friend and I were young and assumed we wouldn't tip. First off we went for dinner and it almost took two hours cause of how slow are food was being brought out. At my restaurant, apps take 7 min tops to come out and I know that's how it is here too because my bestfriend works at the doral location. Our app took twice that time to come out. Then our food which we placed the order right when our apps came out took another 30-40 minutes to come out. Everytime she asked me if I wanted a refill on my drink, she'd forget to bring it and come up to me again and ask me again did u want a refill and I was like uh yeah. Finally our food came out, not only was it bad but it was wrong. 10 dollars for a flatbread which was mostly bread with no tomato or cheese on it. My friends ribs were burnt and she ordered the portobello mushroom salad instead they brought fried mushrooms. Now I've had bad service before but the reason I'm writing this review is because they brought the dish to our table and then we told them no this isn't what we order. They took it to the back. Another completely different server who we hadn't seen all night came up to us and said  did you order the fried mushroom small app and my friend said oh no the order was wrong. We after saw him leave directly to the kitchen and walk out with the SAME plate of mushrooms and took it to another table. THIS IS NOT OK. Any restaurant I've worked at when food hits another table if it is wrong, they will usually give it to the staff or throw it away. I will not being come back to this location solely because I don't know now if my food has been coming from the kitchen or a different table.

When we finally got our food my Steak was completely Raw inside. I can eat rare steak and have never sent food back but this was a joke.  The mashed potatoes under the steak were soaked with blood. We had to wait again for the waitress to come back and take it. They took the same cut open steak and tried to cook it more and brought it back after my wife had already finished eating. Look at it again and its chared and burned on the outside, still raw on the inside and unevenly cooked / dried out from being cut open and re grilled.     Our 8 month old is ready to go home and getting upset. The manager takes the steak off the bill. ( sent back a second time)  I tell them we need the check, we cant wait anymore.    We get the bill and they charged us for food we didn't even order.

258,Ronnita W.,"Miami, FL",72,70,128.0,5.0,2016-11-06,"So my brother and his now FIANCEE had their first date at this location last year. So as he planned his proposal he toyed with the idea of doing it here. Well his work schedule just would not let us be great! Until yesterday he got a shift change...so he contacted the restaurant and was told they could not accommodate him for the requested time. Well I called back about 3 hours before show time and spoke with the manager Laz. When I explained what was going on Laz seemed to really want to help us get this done. So he agreed to the selected time with our party split in half in two different areas. We agreed and were very grateful. Laz explained the whole party had to be present to be seated and we had a 20 minute grace window. My brother's FIANCEE had family returning from Orlando and we were getting close to the end of the grace period. I called the restaurant and they advised they would wait for us and understood. They also were able to get us all seated together!  We came in a group of about 25-30 (planned for 20...) and surprised her at her. He did his proposal she said yes we made lots of noise. Some people left so we maintained our 20, but we slowly moved to our reserved area. Sooooo much excitement!!!! The staff was patient and repeatedly checked with me to ensure we had what we needed and wanted. The service speed was really good for a party this large (actually any sized party) and the checks were appropriately separated with no automatic tip (unusual - I would not have mind if they did...but we made sure to show the staff how much we appreciated them). As far as food...I didn't eat...only margaritas and patron shots..but my 3 children had lemonade, pizza and fries and they were all very pleased. Any place that can host this amount of excitement and still equally please my 3, 4, and 6 year old...is five star in my book.

It has a feeling of sports bar/restaurant but your seperated. For example I had a dinner date with my hubby and 17 yr.old sister so I'm not trying to be in the bar area with her so we sat more on the restaurant side and didn't notice the bar side,in a good way though. There are tv's everywhere so some of the time we would watch the Heat  game that was playing or the soccer game. It really has a spacious setting so it's just a great spot for a sports fan or family and friends just wanting a great place to eat. There food options on the menu were great, we had a hard time choosing what we wanted. Everyone was in the mood for something different so we ordered calamari as an appetizer and we loved it. The marinara sauce used I could've  eaten it with a spoon alone (hey I'm a sauce person, don't  judge) but the lemon garlic aioli was out of this world. I can put that aioli on any and everything. My little sister wanted a burger and added guacamole and cheese and chose the wedges fries,burger perfectly seasoned and cooked and the fries were seasoned to perfection as well,no salty over kill. Hubby had the tuna salad and forgot to let me have a bite (damn him)..guess he loved it cause he cleaned the plate. Lol. I wanted something small and to share so I ordered a new menu item which was the rootbeer wings. I loved them, you could really taste the rootbeer and it made the wings a little sweet,everyone loved them. I had to even lick my fingers clean, yeah dinner table etiquette went completely out the window. We had great family time over dinner and we're left full from our meal,or so I thought. My little sister has a thing for dessert and she has allergies to peanuts so we have to be careful but low and behold they had a gluten free chocolate chip cookie and vanilla icecream dessert that was made completely from scratch in house and had no peanuts, we devoured that warm gooey goodness,not a drop was left.

We had the chicken tortilla soup(chocked with chicken, but a little too spicy at the end as though the spices had sunk to the bottom of the bowl). The clam chowder had a generous amount of clams and was quite good. The broccoli cheese soup was ""just ok"" and the tomato soup was MEH. The wedge salad and the Caesar salad were uninspired.

The menu is excessively long. Towards the back there is a lunch specials page. Lunch is served from 11-3p. There are so many options to chose from it made it difficult to pick what I wanted. I ended up ordering the boneless buffalo chicken and a side of fries (had a craving for this).  My boneless buffalo chicken was good, but this is a pretty average dish and hard to mess up. Fries were  the skinny kind and little too crispy in my opinion. I love fries so I ate them anyways.  Luckily our waitress informed us that we could download the app and get a free MINI pizookie. I had not idea what a pizookie was, so in case you don't either let me explain. A pizookie is a warm skillet cookie topped with ice cream. Yummy! I downloaded the app and ordered the chocolate chunk pizookie.  It came out nice and warm and topped with vanilla ice cream. Pretty good and free!! This place is expensive for the type of food.

We overheard Sandee say to the intoxicated employee table that we were just there for the free pizookies. Part of working in the service industry and having a loyalty app is to get folks into your door, show them good service and offer rewards.

This would be my 3rd time at this restaurant so I can give a honest review based on all my experiences here. I like this place it has a nice atmosphere and some really nice people that work there. There food is pretty good I recently tried the broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl. I loved the concept of eating my soup and eating the bowl after that was already soaked in the soup! I also had the deep dish baked ziti which was very filling. When i fist ordered it i wasn't sure if it would fill me it looked small in the photo but was i wrong! I couldn't finish it .  On 2 of the 3 occasions I had at this restaurants the staff was very nice and professional. One time i came kinda late and the guy we got was a hot mess. Messed up the order never refilled our drinks which is mainly the reason it took me so long to come back.

I know they are mainly known for their beers and pizza, but since I don't eat pizza, I always try to order something different. They actually have a great deal on thursdays, where you can a full rack of ribs with two sides, a salad and dessert at a very decent price. I've had the seared tuna salad, which is okay. They used to give more tuna but they've cut back. Sometimes I have to order an extra side of tuna because the amount is just not enough. The ribs are good - tender and saucy. I also tried the double bone-in pork chop, which tastes like chicken. It doesn't have much flavor and gets overlooked because it's so thick.  I will say that I've never had trouble with the service.

56,Yen D.,"Miami, FL",137,16,56.0,3.0,2017-03-18,"Friday evenings are probably not a good time to go unless you want to wait an hour before getting your food. The wait time in the beginning wasn't that bad, it was about 15-20 minutes. They also gave us a small sample of their pepperoni pizza while we waited, that was a pleasant surprise! More restaurants should do this! Especially if there's lots of hungry people waiting outside. The table we sat at was like the arctic tundra! The couple next to us actually told us three couples already asked to be moved to a different table. We were warriors though and decided to stay. (Hindsight: not sure if that was the best decision, we didn't know it would take another 40-45 minutes to get our food). My advice: bring a jacket just in case they sit you in that area.  The waiter was nice, but they overloaded him with tables, he kept having to apologize. My boyfriend had ordered the coffee and he had forgot, so we informed another worker there and then they forgot. We then reminded him again, but it took another 20 minutes for him to get the coffee. The coffee finally came AFTER the meal even though we had ordered it in the beginning. (It would have been nice to have gotten it early though, my boyfriend almost turned into an icicle).  The food: I ordered the dry rub wings with buffalo sauce on the side, it tasted good. Nice and crunchy on the outside. The boyfried ordered the California chicken club, he said it was okay. The fries it game with was really good though! Had a great crunch to it!  We also got the chocolate chunk piezooki, the combination of chocolate chip cookie and ice cream was perfect! The sides of the cookie had a nice crunch. Nom nom nom. If you love cookies, try this!  If you like the acrtic, food with a nice crunch and slow wait times, then this place is perfect for you!

Not only did they get our order wrong when they brought out the correct deep dish one, it was cold!! i didnt send it back for the fact that i didnt want to wait another 45 minutes for it, but cold deep pizza wasnt the best tasting.

The two appetizers we ordered - one came cold and the calamari was 90% tentacles and 10% rings.  The mahi tacos were good and I would recommend them. However, the honey crisp chicken salad tasted like fish - the chicken and the lettuce.  The Prime Rib Dip sandwich came without the au jus nor dipping sauce - and we were finished with our meal by the time my son received the sauce = cold sandwich and hot dipping sauce.  The mac n cheese couscous and dipping sauce seemed to lack in quantity - I guess supplies were down in the kitchen.  The saddest part is having to pay for this meal.  I'll frequent Flanagans, Duffys or Keg South before visiting BJs again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=60,3.0,3.13,2.824,,3.078

For example, we didn't sit in the bar area. I didn't order a drink off the menu for fear of it all tasting like sour mix, I got an old fashioned. Our waitress was nice, not GREAT, but decent. She was way more attentive than our last server (when we sat in the bar area). I got the Sirloin Steak medium well. It was OK, I've had better. My old fashioned was a very solid old fashioned, it was good. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well but I don't think he was blown away by it.

It was warm, crispy, and basically everything you want in a churro. I would definitely get these again. Overall, a solid experience.

I guess the bartender didn't think so and talking with friends, showing pictures on their cell phones were more important than a first time customer. Finally when her visit was over she came to take my order, at this time there were only 3 people at the bar, and 6 people at a high top table. All of which had already eaten, and had drinks. Ordered an appetizer, waited, and waited, and waited, mind you the 9 people at the bar was it for customers in the entire place. Finally after 20 minutes the appetizer arrived. Terrible first impression.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=20,3.0,3.1,2.828,,3.0600000000000005

0,Lana J.,"Miami, FL",0,3,1.0,2.0,2017-11-22,"BJs is usually the restaurant that I drag my friends too because I love their Pazooki! But today it was different. The service was absolutely awful dinner took 2 hours. For  one appetizer and 3 entrees... awful. I never go online to 'bash' a restaurant but it was awful. My meal was spoiled by the wait because the server was down. The waitress was never anywhere near our table, just to get the check took 30 minutes alone. This was an awful experience. Honestly if you come for the pazooki like most of us do. Just order out. Service was awful. The woman at the front desk was not only sassy but snippy. Giving my close friend an EYE roll. Very unprofessional. Don't know what happening to BJS but I'm very disappointed with today's meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2?start=20,3.04,3.07,2.824,,3.058
43,Krys P.,"Miami, FL",301,939,2833.0,4.0,2017-12-06,"Once every few months I attend the beer dinner at BJ's.  It's a nice value, for $40 (or $45 if not prepaid) you get a five course dinner with 7 beers (with refills if you can handle more). They also have lower price for designated drivers, and for customers with special diet needs, they basically hand you the full menu for you to pick something you like.  So, I've been here with coworkers for regular meals and beer dinners.  For beer dinners this is a nice location, compare to the others, they have a lively MC so the mood is very festive, if a bit loud.  However, service is chaotic with a large group.  Items like water that you ask for multiple times may not arrive, and one time the steak knives were delivered when the majority of the people had cleared their plates.  Their food is not bad, with some better than others. Meat dishes like pork chop or prime ribs are not bad for the price, and the chili is quite good. Definitely do not order the salad - the leaves are not fresh and the kale way too old to be used in salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2,3.0,3.07,2.828,,3.042
44,Christian J.,"Miami, FL",11,38,117.0,3.0,2017-12-17,"The food at this chain is very mediocre.  Stopped in with my family on Saturday, waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The waitress was okay, not the bubbliest but we got a round of beers and ordered the kids their food. The kids food came and we ordered our food, three burgers which you would think would come out pretty fast, however we waited a while for them. The kids finished their food and we were still waiting. What made our experience not so great is the fact that it was freezing inside. My wife's burger got cold halfway through her meal. Not a good way to enjoy a meal when your freezing your a-- off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2,2.96,3.07,2.836,,3.026
45,Francesca J.,"Miami, FL",16,57,136.0,3.0,2017-12-17,"I have been to BJ's several times, and while it's never a magnificent culinary experience, it is a good go-to spot for a quick meal.  Today my family and I decided to grab a quick lunch here.  Once seated, we placed my kids orders since feeding them first is crucial.  After placing their orders we waited a long time before the waitress came back to take our orders.  My kids even got their food and finished it before we were even able to order.  After we did get to order, we noticed it was taking a really long time to get our food.  We all had ordered burgers (there were 3 adults) so weren't sure what was taking so long, and while waiting also noticed how unbelievably cold the restaurant was.  At this point, my daughter had finished eating and was asking if we could take her outside to warm up, luckily I had just purchased a sweater in the mall so I was able to give it to her to warm up.  Once our food arrived, I was pleased with my cheeseburger.  It wasn't the best i'd ever had but it was good.  I cut my burger in half and started to eat, unfortunately by the time I got to the second 1/2 of the burger I was disappointed to discover the other 1/2 was cold!!!! Not sure why they had to keep the restaurant so cold, but it definitely made for an unenjoyable experience.  I left my second half of the burger, because to me theres nothing worse than cold hamburgers, we paid quick and raced out of there so we could defrost.  If I happen to find myself at this location again I will make a point to get a table outdoors!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2,2.96,3.07,2.844,,3.026

42,Jose P.,"Miami, FL",23,85,118.0,4.0,2018-01-02,"Love BJ's. Came here on a Monday evening and they have *Half off Large Pizzas*  We ordered 2 of them and slit both in half to have different types. What a great selection / choice to have. We were a party of 7 which the pizza was filling enough for us all. One split pizza was Bacon, chicken, ranch and the other half was spicy Hawaiian. Man was that pizza selection flavorful! Our second choice was a split for the BJ's brewhouse pizza and half Mediterranean.  These four style pizzas were cooked deep dish style. The pizza was good and had flavor but they do lack sauce. This is my only complaint for their deep dish. You have to ask for extra dipping sauce because the pizza doesn't have enough.  My wife did order the shrimp scampi which was cooked to perfection, just enough butter and garlic to make your palate smile.  We've had the avocado egg rolls here before and they are to die for. If ever in the falls area or by dolphin mall   Go to BJ's they have a large menu , something for everyone.  I'm rating this 4 star only because the lack of sauce in their deep dish. I hope they load it a little more for the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miami-2,2.88,3.09,2.856,,3.006

My salad was good and the pasta was very good!! Also quite filling.  When I asked for the check the server mentioned that I had an old menu and the actual price for my food was $15 (which I totally wouldn't have minded) but she spoke with the manager and they kept it as $10.
