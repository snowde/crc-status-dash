87,Amber C.,"Meridian, ID",38,75,34.0,3.0,2013-09-27,"A group of us from work went here for lunch. They have been pretty busy all week: this is the first week they have been open. They are in the new Austin Landing development, next to Panera.  We went fairly early to try to beat the lunch rush. The place was starting to fill up but there were lots of open tables still. The wait time was ok, (just over five minutes) but the communication between the hostess and our party was pitiful. We were unsure of where to go or what to do based on her half-formed responses and then she basically just ignored us.  The restaurant itself is very nice inside, with lovely high ceilings and dark wood furniture. We did not go in the bar area but it looked nice as well. The staff was attentive but there were so many of them all over they were tripping on each other. I assume that this is a ""first week"" issue that I am assuming is due to training and guessing at needed staff levels. I hope so.  Our server was a very friendly at first, although he seemed to ""get lost"" half way through our meal and then managed to turn from being very friendly into almost rude when resurfaced. The servers are obviously all still learning but the bussers and runners managed to ""serve from the right and pull from the left"" although our server did not. Normally that type of thing wouldn't even occur to me but they are aiming for a fancy look here and the hundred other people who came to our table (we honestly had at least 5 people running back and forth serving us and such, it was a circus at times) all did it so it stood out when he didn't. I will give all the million and one servers credit however: the manager was walking around checking on tables (lovely) and wasn't quite shy about correcting any of them in front of everyone (not so lovely).  The important part: the food. I had the roast beef dip sandwich with wedge fries. The fries were ""eh""...a typical wedge fry. Not much to do to make them amazing or horrible. The sandwich was great, even though I had forgotten to ask for it without cheese. The roast beef was delicious and the bread, although much too ""doughy"" was a good complement. The horseradish sauce was phenomenal: simple yet just perfectly tasty. The au jus was cold when I got my plate and the cheese on my sandwich was as well (it was melted, but already cold) which leads me to think it was probably sitting for too long before getting to me. It is still a sandwich I would order again, with the exception being I will get it without cheese and with the string fries instead. My co-workers all enjoyed their meals as well. Three of them got the flatbread/salad combo, and it looked light and delicious and fresh and is definitely a good choice for a lighter lunch. Two others got the quesadilla, which looked very nice and was well plated. Both seemed to enjoy it as well.  Only one person tasted a beer, a Blonde (hey, it was a working lunch!) but he said it tasted fine.  The end of the meal ended with our now impatient and smart-alec server dumping a glass of water on two of us. Sigh.  Overall, the food was very good. The lunch menu is a great option and a decent value, the rest of the menu is way over-priced for what you get. The service could definitely have been better, but given it is so new, I am erring on the positive side, believing they will iron out the wrinkles and lose the attitudes once they gain more confidence. It took us an hour and half to dine there and part of that was almost ten minutes of waiting for waters/drinks! Again, I am hoping that a bit more time will smooth out that time issue as well, as it is not an option for a working day lunch for those of us who have an hour or so.  I will try them again in a few weeks and go with my son and without a schedule in mind so we can relax and enjoy it more. Hopefully that will kick the place up another star or two!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=100,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
124,Steve G.,"West Chester Township, OH",58,20,4.0,4.0,2013-10-10,Nice beer selection.  The home brewed beers are pretty good.  I had the jalapeño burger and it was great.  My girlfriend had the chicken fresco and she really enjoyed it as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=140,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
114,Tony R.,"Flemington, NJ",0,14,,1.0,2013-10-14,"Horrible dining experience.  Poor service.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted by our server.  Got lost for long periods of time as drink orders took exceptional wait times surpassed only the the inordinate delay in getting two of three entrees.  The third seemed to be as lost as the kitchen staff.  Asked to see manager but was told he was working on the cooking line. Are you kidding me?  The food is a mediocre attempt at making American fare.  The southen fried chicken is two thin chicken cutlets breaded, over fried to dryness and served in 45 minutes over pasty mashed potatoes.  The chicken pasta was a pasty  mess with some broccoli thrown in and no real discernible seasoning or taste.   Cheeseburger has no flavor and despite menu description of being served with thousand island dressing none appeared and the server was perplexed as to what to do.   Finally the beer.  Having been to many microbrewery pubs the first requirement is that the glassware is ""beer clean"".  Fastest way to tell if they are beer clean is the amount of head when poured.  Of four beers ordered at the table not one had a head on it and no effervescence.  When questioned the server said it always looks like that.  Sure cannot tell if the beer is any good but it sure goes flat quickly.   I cannot tell if the crowds are because it is a new restaurant or if the time to turn over a table exceeds two hours.  Stay away from this place.  If you go don't say you weren't warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=120,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
70,Sherry E.,"Springboro, OH",70,138,199.0,3.0,2013-10-30,"I have been here twice since this location opened and each visit was satisfactory. Our food was prepared adequately and the wait staff were average. BJ's reminds me of a typical chain restaurant; maybe like a cousin of Applebee's. Several selections varying from burgers to pasta, and even pizza. My favorite experience has been the cookie dessert. A personal pizza-sized baked cookie with ice cream on top. Mmmm. BJ's has a large beer selection that the franchise apparently owns/ brews in some location unknown to me and ships to its restaurants. Although the beer is a somewhat neat and unique marketing ploy, I find the experience a bit over saturating. IMO, a beer crafter finds a style of beer and perfects it. BJ's has attempted to create every type of beer on earth. It makes their beer expertise feel too diluted. A side note to the manager: you would make more money off of me if you offered happy hour to the entire front of the house and not just the bar. After discovering that dinning room guests are excluded from the benefit of happy hour, I have vowed to never buy beer or an appetizer during happy hour. We often get an appetizer and I usually drink beer when we eat out, but never again here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=60,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
76,Kathleen C.,"Miamisburg, OH",35,61,14.0,4.0,2013-11-05,"Food was good. Avocado egg rolls are good for an appetizer. My husband loved the beer sampler and that you can choose the number of samples. The place is big enough that you don't have to wait long to be seated (on a weekday).  I had the pulled pork sandwich with wedge fries. The fries are really good. Sandwich was good as well. Nothing unique, but good. My husband had the wings. He LOVES wings and said they were really good.  The service was fine. Not great, but not bad. But we are not high maintenance customers.

71,Oliver R.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,69,41.0,2.0,2013-11-09,"This is just another in along line of typical chain restaurants. This place is a cross between Fridays, O'Charley's and Applebee's.  We stopped in for a late lunch. We had the avocado egg rolls, one small pizza, one soup and salad combo, one drink and one beer. Our total bill was $49. Decor: It is a nice place. It is very clean and the TVs are not overpowering. They are there and you notice them but you are not forced to look at them all the time.  Food: Average and pricey. See above for what we ordered. Service: This being a chain restaurant I know that service is hit or miss. Either you get a good server or you do not. In this case, we did not. We had to ask for water four times before any water was served. The waiter seemed very rushed and did not offer ideas or explain what BJs was all about. Our experience was more of a ""what do you want"" versus the server talking to us to offer suggestions and guide us through our meal.

115,Adam M.,"Dayton, OH",0,7,,2.0,2013-11-18,"Just like every other chain restaurant. Focus primarily on environment and atmosphere, not much focus on the food. I'll give them a little of a break because being pretty new they were packed to the gills. So I can forgive slow food and drinks(our server was very polite and apologetic about any slowness which I appreciate). So here is my complaint. If your gonna take extra time getting me food at least make it good. We had pizza, burgers, appetizers, and beer.  Everything was bland and so so. Not the worst thing I ever had but definitely not great. Even my 12 year old was like ""eh"". If you can't excite a teenagers taste buds with pizza and burgers then you are really doing something wrong. Beer also was just OK. If your looking to go somewhere to watch a game and chug some beers it would be ok. If your looking for a nice meal with the family, go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=120,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006
132,Brian C.,"Dayton, OH",83,282,26.0,3.0,2013-11-20,"When I write a review I hate to compare one place to another but the whole time we were here we kept thinking how much BJ's is like the Cheesecake Factory except with pizza and beer. The decor, menu, even some of the food items like the avocado springrolls are very Cheesecake Factory-esque. The place was packed, took us a few laps to find a parking spot but once inside the wait was 15-20 minutes and we were seated in about that time so not too bad. The beer selection was great, not quite as good as Chappy's Taproom (sorry, another comparison!), but pretty danged good for a chain! The service was friendly and prompt and our avocado springrolls came out pretty quickly. We ordered the deep dish pizza which is their signature dish (we ordered the gourmet meat version), and it was served shortly after we finished our appetizers. Overall the pizza was pretty good, not our favorite in town but pretty solid. Our favorite part about the pizza though was the crust, it was reminiscent of the old school Godfather's Pizza crust (dang! another comparison!), but seriously, it was light, crunchy, and buttery like Godfather's used to be way back when. For a chain, BJ's is pretty good and overall it was a solid experience. It was a little pricey, $40 for one regular sized beer, a beer sampler, a small pizza, and the avocado springrolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=140,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

The stout is good, think Guinness minus the bitter aftertaste. The pumpkin ale was also pretty tasty.  The food is what you would expect from a chain. Got the turkey sandwich, didn't knock my socks off, but was satisfying. my wife had same thought on fish tacos Service was great, but we went early at lunch. Waitress made a couple good beer recommendations. 1st time we tried going, walked out after hearing it would be a two hour wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=120,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

After reading the sign, I stood in the lobby for 1/2 hour but it never materialized, so we went to sit down. It's a good effort for the area. The beer list definitely had promise, but we were there for lunch and I only drink after 12:15.  My bison burger had less meat than one at a vegetarian restaurant, so it was just okay. The side salad thing was caked in dressing and oniony to boot. The service is definitely good but I don't think it will turn into the high class place they're trying to make it be.

For all the hype, I don't understand what everyone's buzzing about.  I was referred by a friend who apparently had a much better experience than I did. The bar staff are fast and seem to be knowledgeable, however for their prices I don't think I'll ever drink here again. I noticed they had Goose Island's 312 on draft and I ordered one,  thinking the total would be $5.50 or less. Nope! $7.50 for a draft of Goose Island. Never again!  Our food was decent, nothing spectacular. We were seated in a lower level booth with other booths above us, where we could not see what the other diners had ordered. After eating the table above us that I could not see had ordered some sort of fish that smelled amazing. When I asked the served what they had ordered, she replied, ""I'm not sure I'd have to see what it was"" and then walked away. Now, if I had just wrapped up a dinner with guests who have not yet paid I would go above and beyond what it takes to ensure a good tip. However this waitress didn't think it was necessary to continue decent service and couldn't care less as to if we returned or not. So guess who's not returning?

The food and service was really quite good. I ordered a hamburger cooked medium rare, came out perfect! Husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was also quite tasty! Second time on a whim, ordered the mozzarella and tomato as a salad starter. Excellent choice as tomatoes tasted like they were just pulled out of the garden.  Ordered the pan pizza on the second trip, again normally not a fan of thick crust, but I think it is the best thick crust Dayton offers.

Our waitress (Elizabeth) was incredibly sweet and chatty. We had drinks and an appetizer not too long after we sat down.  I had the Jack's Berry Lemonade - it was a strong drink and a little too sour but still really good. My husband ordered a Long Beach Ice Tea that he wound up not drinking (said it was too strong) and luckily, they took that drink off our bill.  The drinks are expensive. They were all close to $10 each - which I didn't realize until after I had ordered a Strawberry Splash (frozen and delicious!) We had some mozzerella sticks that were a little lacking in the cheese department but the breading was so good, you didn't notice too much.  We split a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. I LOVE their pizzas. So, so good.  Over the years, I have had a wide variety of items from their menu and have never been disappointed with any of it.  Our service slowed down significantly halfway thru the meal but the place was still busy. Our waitress was absolutely the nicest at all times.  We took most of our pizza to go but it was worth it.  2 boozey beverages, root beer, salad, mozzerella sticks, and a large deep dish was over $70 plus a hefty tip.

75,Aimee P.,"Springboro, OH",35,3,9.0,1.0,2014-11-14,"Went to BJ's to celebrate signing the lease of our new apartment with my new roommate.  SERVICE-We were not told ahead of time that Happy Hour specials were served only in the bar area. So after sitting ten minutes in the dining room waiting for someone, anyone, to take our drink order, we flagged down a server and asked where we could find a listing for Happy Hour. She responded that we needed to be seated in the bar to receive those and seemed annoyed that we asked. We moved and were quickly greeted by a new server. She started out really strong with great service, unfortunately that level of service dropped off as our visit grew longer. She became less attentive with each question we asked. It got to the point that we decided to end our visit even though there were more items we wanted to try. We felt rushed and not welcomed.   FOOD-the menu is pretty good sized, maybe too big for its own good. It took quite a long time for our appetizers to come out once we placed our order. I have been in the restaurant industry for 25+ years and know it shouldn't take a half hour for apps to come out. I had the California Club Flatbread. It was ok. Not great, not terrible. The blend of flavors was good, but the amount of toppings was off. The avocado was nearly non-existent. I had a glass of the Berry Burst Cider, and that was definitely the highlight of the evening. It was fresh tasting and filled with delicious fruit flavors. This cider is well done! But once again, I think the beer menu may be a bit ambitious as it offers so many variables it can be difficult to decide. For dessert, we split the peach cobbler and it was simply divine, but it took entirely too long for it to be served.  ATMOSPHERE-The restaurant is clean and well maintained. It is what I would call classy casual. Nothing stood out as unique or exciting-just a nice looking, shiny place to eat. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with BJ's. The food is not worth the price we paid for it and the service was simply not up to par.

We were greeted by our server, Sarah, within a couple minutes of being seated which was great. We each ordered a beer and decided to split a pizza and have salads as an appetizer. The beers came within minutes of ordering and the salads shortly after. Both of which were good. The pizza was excellent! Deep and loaded with toppings. We tried the BJ's favorite which was basically a deluxe pizza. My only complaint was that the pizza had hardly any sauce, but our server was very attentive and brought me a side of marinara.

To be honest, it wasn't that big of a deal to me. It was wood, not something grotesque. She went to the kitchen staff and showed them. Next thing I know the manager is there apologizing profusely. I assured him it was fine. He paid for my meal. I also told him that was not necessary. I felt they went out of their way to insure I was a satisfied customer.

45,Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",82,240,283.0,5.0,2015-06-19,"I first tried this chain restaurant in California. I remember calling my boyfriend back home and telling him ""man, I wish they had a BJ's near us!""  ...lo and behold, there was! I had never heard of the chain before so I was pleasantly surprised to dine at this location after my California excursion.  The setting is like an upscale sports bar mixed with an Applebee's. The prices of the food and drinks are OUTSTANDING.  Seriously. It was the very first thing I noticed... everything is relatively cheap, compared to other restaurants like Friday's, Applebee's, etc... I don't like those restaurants for their bland food and overzealous prices. And there's a large selection of different appetizers and entrées. What a THICK menu!!  Our server, Lindsay, (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong), was unlike most servers we've had before. Her serving style was so...blunt? There wasn't any artifical sweetness, no flattery and small talk...it was almost as if she was serving us as we were her aquaintances, so she didn't need to put on all those unneeded frills. It was honestly strange at first, but then I found it to be quite refreshing. I've worked at Fleming's for a little while and it reminded me of the regulars and servers interacting as friends...not as a tip-fishing waiting staff serving a customer. But anyway... way off track. The BLT salad was good... I wanted more blu cheese :'( but the portion size of the toppings were correct for normal people. The bread bowl with tomato bisque I ordered was AWESOME... Not a traditional dinner by any means, but it made me very happy. All of our food came out relatively fast. The salty caramel cookie... (I forgot the exclusive name of the dessert) was HEAVENLY. I freaking love the salty sweet combination and it was just perfect. So perfect.  Our server took great care of us, and we'll definitely be back. The hostesses up front should appear/act more friendly and attentive. There was a group of five or more staff members idly chatting away with each other as customers left the restaurant.

The queso was really great, bbq brisket burger is awesome, fish and chips were excellent, drinks were to be expected. Cons: Second visit....

Fair enough. Arrived when no one was waiting and was seated within 30 min which is much better than the original 2 hrs quoted. My husband ordered the sirloin med-well and it came out dry and closer to well-done. I ordered the Santa Fe salad and it came missing several items such as cheese, corn, and tortillas on top. The food was dropped off by runners who quickly ran off without asking if we needed anything else. Waiters are always running around when it wasn't even busy and acting put out if we asked them for something. When we finally caught the waiter who was avoiding our table, we kindly asked the for another steak and they obliged but it came after everyone was finished eating. We weren't given anything for our trouble but an apology which is great and all but when you can't even enjoy your meal with your family and have to hurry up to eat after everyone is finished, what's the point?

He then advised us that we should've ordered it a different way and we wouldn't have gotten charged for it.  He awkwardly made us feel like it was our fault and he was doing us a favor by removing a $3 charge for about $0.10 worth of syrup.   We also ordered the Brussels Sprout and they were burned and REALLY, really salty.  We were going to re-order them but server could not be found.  We were looking around for about 10 minutes when a different server came over and asked us about it.  She never apologized, she just said she would tell the server.  Calamari also overcooked and this dish had NO salt.  It really seemed that the cook had forgotten and seasoned the Sprouts twice and not the calamari.  The Club Flatbread however was very good.

Our issues this Sunday were pretty basic.  I had a party of 6&1/2, so we called ahead after Church (Around 1230 or so) and was told that we were looking at a 30 delay.  Outstanding, put us on the list and we'll be there in 15!  Sounds perfect, right?  It took a full hour and 10 minutes to get us a seat!  We saw similar parties in size come in and be seated...no biggie ""if"" they had called ahead but here's the thing, they didn't.  When we were finally seated, it was because I went up, showed the gal on my phone where they acknowledged my call-in to which I got a bright, ""Oh, You're Next""...No apology or other acknowledgement of an error.  I did hear one of the gals mutter to the other...""oh, I f'd up"" as I passed the hostess area.  Lack of professionalism aside, somebody should have apologized to us for the error. Still, water under the bridge, we were seated back in the last section and...ignored.  Two other large parties were sat near us and...ignored.  Another full 20 minutes and one...one...only one...server showed up to work the ENTIRE FREAKIN' SECTION!  Thought she was going to cry when she saw the number of folks in her area.  Still, she gave it a heck of a go!   Sadly, nobody was supporting her...food was slow to come out and therefore no longer warm...drinks were slow...everything was S.L.O.W.  Good thing my family all liked each other at that particular point in time and the Grandkids were angelic...even the baby...which is suspicious, but on a different level.  Other tables were not as forgiving.  Kind of embittered the entire section if you know what I mean.  Poor kid. We finally got our bill and paid our bail bond to get free of this situation.  Walked out the door at 3:45...with nary a manager to be seen.  He/she didn't come out to support the Waitress, not even once.  I did not push it since family was mostly happy, a little stir crazy but mostly happy.  But dang, what a complete and utter failure on the customer service side.  Sadly, this BJ's location is off my food radar for the immediate future.  Maybe once the colleges let out and they get some additional help but for now...nope.

We waited forever to even see a server.  Then after we ordered it took another 30 minutes to get our food. The soup, fries, and burger were lukewarm at best. The burger was below average, even had it been hot.  It also came with no cheese or onions although I had specifically ordered both.

36,David H.,"Miamisburg, OH",9,10,,3.0,2017-05-13,I would have given a higher rating for the food. This particular visit my server was non existent and absent minded. The restaurant was not busy as it was early lunch. My appetizer (flatbread) was overcooked and burnt.  I asked for a refill and ice...refill came with no ice.  10 minutes later I got ice and was told they would be right back to refill. She never returned. She brought the check with a full glass of ice sitting on the table and no refill. I'm thinking carry out from now on. I love their pizza and salads but service  is awful!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=20,2.92,3.38,3.38,,3.196

The hostesses were very nice and accommodating but our server was less than attentive. We were never offered a refill and had to flag our server down for each one. Our appetizers took over 30 minutes to appear and were overcooked. Our meals were less than thrilling; undercooked broccoli and brussel sprouts, small pasta portions for the price, overcooked salmon, etc. I had a burger, fries, brussel sprouts and a soda and spent $22 before tip.

Shirley something for everybody. We did the happy hour and got half off a bunch of different things. I love the wings they were amazing, the avocado rolls were great, the pizza was just OK. It was about 2/3 crust and only a tiny little bit of toppings. (actually the only thing we did not like.) And the wine was half off which was awesome. We will definitely go there again if you're in the area.

BJ's features a huge bar, tons of taps, lots of seating, clean bathrooms and generally great service. The menu is very large with something for everyone. And the quality is pretty good. I was excited to eat here because of my previous visits but man did they drop the ball. I can pretty much sum up my 2 star rating with 2 sentences.  6 people, 3 hour wait when told 45. Food came out and was cold.  I'm not kidding, 3 hour wait from the time we walked into the restaurant to when we got our food. I ordered the quinoa rice with shrimp (thought I'd try something new) and it came out cold to the touch. The manager blamed it on Christmas party's but good god Man that is bad.
