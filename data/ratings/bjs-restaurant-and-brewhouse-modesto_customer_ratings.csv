407,Neill H.,"Lakewood, CA",2,6,,2.0,2012-01-08,"I recently came to this Bj Restaurant and we had a terrible waitress and food experience. I obviously knew it'd take time for the food to cook but we waited nearly 30-40 minutes for the 5 of us to get our food. I've come to visit Merced and originally live in Inglewood and have had a much better, quicker, tastier food back home. My aunt n cousin got the Rib Eye Stake really dry and my cousin got a Calzone that was puny and demeaning to what the description said. I give it 2 stars cause my wings were delicious and drinks were good too. But the quality of the rest of my cousins family food lacked greatly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=400,3.2,3.08,3.08,2.536,3.1280000000000006

My dinner buddy and i rushed to the opening. We ordered a couple beers while deciding what to order. Carmen, our waitress, forgot to put in our beer orders twice. We finally ordered...and eventually our beers arrived. Nice ceasar salad, decent tomato bisque. I really like the bisque at Nordtroms and Elephant Bars alot better. I ordered the ""new"" portabello mushroon pizza. It was so new my friend didnt even have it listed in her menu. Our dinners and second round of refreshments came eventually. Great food, too long of a wait.

409,Amanda H.,"Modesto, CA",0,29,,2.0,2012-03-25,"Seating takes a long time and so does the food. The noise level is a little much for me because it's always packed and it's a big place (I mean, I understand that part is out of their hands but thought I would mention it for your sakes).  I have been there 3 times by chance. The first time, i had pizza. It was blazze. I love the decorations and it's a very clean place. The second time, I had a delicious peach daiquiri, fantastic artichoke spinach dip, and a positively addicting avocado roll.  The third time, I had a really bad shrimp scampi pasta. It didn't taste of garlic at all and was dry and flavorless. 2 mediocre at best meals and 2 fantastic appetizers. I have 10 people in my family and we all went together. No one liked it.

I was dissapointed with their customer service on my last visit; thus, when I went home, I filed a complaint.

240,Danny H.,"Atlanta, GA",9,408,38.0,3.0,2012-05-23,"The 14-year old in me was cruising down Rte. 99 on my way to Modesto to see a minor league baseball team called ""The Nuts,"" when the hunger struck.  I'd say I whipped out the trust ol' smartphone, but I'm a responsible driver, so I made my friend do it instead.  As a rule of thumb when traveling, try nothing you can get at home - and when the name ""BJ's"" came up, the 14-year old said to say no more, that's where we're going. It didn't occur to me that Beej's was a regional chain until after the visit, but the point remains is that it was new to me, and that was all that really mattered.  The Modesto location is conveniently located immediately off of Route 99, as part of a shopping mall.  That being said, parking is often predicated on the time of day, and/or the demand of something at the mall.  Considering the parking lot was completely packed when I got there, I wonder what alternatives there are to do in Modesto.  Needless to say, there's plenty of parking spaces, but being shared with a mall, it may or may not be an easy plight in finding a spot to actually park. Regardless, I must have gotten there at a perfect time; it was a Saturday afternoon at around 5:00 pm, so I'm guessing I was literally just arriving moments before the dinner rush was to begin.  So, in spite of what other reviewers mentioned about long wait times, I was seated promptly by a pretty hostess who seemed oddly interested in the weather in Atlanta upon chatting with me for a moment. Service was prompt and attentive, and more than willing to give suggestions and field my questions about their house brews.  I'm no expert on beer by any means, but I like to drink what refreshes my pallet so to speak, and because I have a fascination with buffalos, I ended up going with their Tatonka stout.  It was a bit sweeter than say a Guinness, but it wasn't as thick.  That being said, it went down smooth, and could be a brew that I could easily thrown back several before knowing what hit me. As for the food, I ordered the fish tacos.  Actually, they were kind enough to do a one-and-one for me, and give me one of the chargrilled mahi-mahi and one chargrilled shrimp.  The shrimp taco was a little on the bland side, but the mahi-mahi taco was excellent.  A good amount of flavor and sauce, without totally drowning out the taste of the meat itself.  I made the mistake of eating the mahi-mahi first.  It was served with chips and dip on the side. The price of my entire experience was nothing really out of the ordinary.  They're not expensive to where it's worth complaining, and they're not so cheap to warrant talking about.  If I ever head back up to the NorCal or Modesto areas, I'd gladly give Beej's more business, as I'd like to go and sample all their house brews, as well as their in-house root beer and cream soda.  Easily worth making a repeat trip or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=240,3.12,3.08,3.08,2.54,3.0960000000000005

It's always nice to be greeted with a smile (first rule for customer service IMO), we weren't. Our server was polite and friendly but oh so slow except when it came to ordering , I felt rushed. I had the Sweet Pig, not very flavorful, think Round Tables ham and pineapple is better. My husband had the deep fried prawns, they were a little over cooked but tolerable. Our friend had the fish and chips, he said pretty good. Before we were finished our server asked if she could cash us out because they wanted her off the floor. Hmm, another not so customer friendly move. All in all I would say this place serves the standard chain food that is a bit lacking. They have many choices on beers and other alcohol which seems to be their forte. Service pretty much sucked.

We went in during lunchtime and it was pretty busy but we got seated right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, shrimp tacos, sweet pig deep-dish pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a chocolate chunk pizookie. We only had to wait around 15-20 minutes for our food to get to the table which was pretty decent timing considering how many people were there on a Friday afternoon.

520,Tala F.,"Turlock, CA",0,1,,2.0,2012-07-07,"I typically do not like chain restaurants because I feel the quality of the food is somewhat mediocre and something that I can make at home, however, I have enjoyed BJ's because they have a pretty descent selection of beer and good food. I was with a large party and had one hell of a time getting a grilled turkey burger. I was one of the first people to arrive and order my food. When I received my food they had given me a veggie burger and insisted that it was a turkey burger, my waiter finally offered to correct his mistake and get me what I originally ordered. I figured it would be out quickly, but to my surprise it took an hour and a half to receive a turkey burger but no fries. Then it took like 15 more minutes to get the fries that were supposed to come with the meal. The manager came over to apologize because my meal was mistakenly given to the wrong table and offered to comp my meal.

329,Jorgess M.,"Roseville, CA",198,268,166.0,1.0,2012-07-17,"The second BJ's I have ever been to and the first one in Roseville is awesome. I was excited to go to Modesto with my boyfriend to go shopping and to actually eat here. It was between this or Buffalo Wild Wings right in front, unfortunately BJ's won. I regret it now....  Walked in, hostess told us it'll be about a couple minutes because they're still cleaning up our table. So we stood there, awkwardly, with her just staring at us, and awkward.... We finally got to our table and long story short....  Service:  Waitress came off as rude, but I didn't wanna judge her right away, however, throughout our lunch I realized she really was just rude. My boyfriend is a pretty chill and nice person, who doesn't get bothered by anyone, but this fool just rubbed him the wrong way. She seriously just ignored everything about us. We put our glasses at the edge of the table so she can see that we need refills but still nothing for about fifteen minutes until my boyfriend finally decided to ask her. The craziest thing at the end of our lunch happened too (as if we didn't already hate her), we asked for more refills and she filled it up HALFWAY!!!!! WTF!!?? Seriously!? Food: Their pizza didn't really help our experience either. We ordered a medium great white and that was lame. Barely any sauce which made the whole pizza extremely blah, and the chicken was as dry as the desert, so that was probably one of the worst pizzas I've had (Digiorno Pizza is better). We also ordered calamari and that was even worse. The presentation was horrible!!!! Horrible I say! It looks like it came from a frozen meal, the whole thing was falling apart, and it tasted like it was just microwaved, no crunchiness to it whatsoever, or just anything.

We were first greeted by a cute but mousey girl who quickly gave us attention almost as if we were the only ones there. She took our drink orders then gave us menus so we could decide on any of their stellar offerings. Having to tend to the others she walked over to the other side of the bar and we were left with her counterpart who was equally cute and feisty as all get up! You should've seen it, the banter between my friend and miss fierce was CLASSIC! She was such a tease and made our little visit sooo much fun.

307,Michael K.,"Berkeley, CA",343,20,8.0,1.0,2013-01-06,"This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I went with a group of 4 friends at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. We were given a half hour wait, which I had expected. Our buzzer rang at 9 and I thought that this meant they were ready for us. The waitress told us to wait at the side. Many groups after us were instructed to do so and subsequently given tables before us, until almost the whole waiting area had been cleared - which made it seem like they forgot about us. After 10 more minutes we were finally given a seat. Once we sat down a waitress told us she'll be right there and placed one drink napkin on the table (um, what?), but it did take more time before she actually came back. We ordered 2 Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's, 1 Chicken Marsala, 1 club sandwich. The final person wanted to try to loaded baked potato. Before ordering, he wanted to know why just a baked potato was $8.00 and a menu category. The waitress assured him it was plenty of food (there's a point to this later on). She memorized it (cue signs of something bound to go wrong) and was off. We waited another half hour for our food, which I initially thought was fine. But then the food came. The two Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's came without bread, with the waiter remarking that they were making more and would be brought out shortly. My friend's ""giant"" loaded potato was normal sized and obviously not enough for a full meal. I thought my meal would be the only one that worked, but then I cut into my chicken. It was COMPLETELY RAW aside from the outside. Disgusted, I called the waitress over - she quickly apologized and brought it back to the kitchen. My friend then called over a menu and ordered a bowl of clam chowder to add to his obvious unfulfilling potato. I then waited another 20 minutes for my food to be returned. My two other friends finished their pasta's - but they never got the bread that the waiter said he was bringing (didn't see that one coming). While I was waiting, another waiter brought my friend a cup of clam chowder - which he then had to ask another waiter to fix because he had, like I said, ordered a bowl. Their fix? They brought out another cup of clam chowder claiming that two cups were equivalent to one of their bowls (by this point, I was having trouble believing them). Then, finally, they returned my Chicken Marsala with another apology. Fortunately, it tasted fine; unfortunately, I was the only one of our group of 5 now eating. Then, when I was almost finished, they brought out the bread he had promised 45 minutes ago. We finished our meal with a pizookie trio. They gave us our check once we had finished the dessert, and I noticed there were very few people sitting around us. The time read 10:45pm - 2 hours and 15 minutes after we had originally came to BJs. I'm fine with waiting, but that seems a little extreme. Oh, and did I mention that they billed us for my raw chicken dish? I'm not one to complain about  waiting or prices, because both of these things can't be controlled by the staff.

He was wonderful & helpful & the only one who went out of his way for his customers. I am a regular customer to BJ's but this was my first time at this location & the worse restaurant experience ever!! Everything was just ridiculous. I went in tonight for dinner, my last night before I head home tomorrow, & was met with a horrible, horrible experience. The food, the manager, the food AGAIN, then the manager AGAIN! I came into dinner with a party of 4 including myself, & we were seated promptly. Orders taken & everything in an orderly fashion. My first complaint is that one of the orders, their famous rib eye steak, was literally half fat. I understand that it's a fatty type of steak, but for half of the steak to have that much fat, we weren't paying $20 for fat. So the server replaces it with the new york steak because it's leaner, & that was charred. Burned. Inedible. However we weren't going to wait an additional 20 minutes for another awful steak. Then a manager, named Paul (just Paul since he refused to give us his last name) passed by with a ""oh, your new steak is here"" without even caring to stop. Just passed by. After all of that, I ordered my pizookie, because at this point that's the only thing that could make this AWFUL experience tolerable. & after a few bites, I find a sharp piece of plastic, in my mouth. I ask for the manager once again, & the only thing she offers me is a guest complaint sheet. What good is that to me at the moment?! The management is horrible, not going the extra step in making their customer happy. The management didn't know how to handle the situation & left customers unhappy & dissatisfied!!!

We ordered a large sweet pig with NO tomatoes and on half of the pizza, we said light cheese. When our pizza came out there were big chunks of tomatoes with NO cheese. Our waitress even said she noticed that there was no cheese on the pizza and saw the tomatoes, but looked at her paper and saw she wrote light cheese and no tomatoes, but gave it to us anyway. On one of the slices, my fiancé noticed something green on the pizza that looked like mold. The general manager, Fred came because my fiancé wanted to ask what it was. He said it wasn't mold, He took our pizza right awy and made us a fresh batch before we can even observe it even more.  With all our time wasted, they gave us our bill and expected some sort of compensation for our time wasted by our incompetent waitress, but my fiancé ended up paying for the whole bill.

Friend had the personal deep-dish pizza and Caesar salad. Really good, and inexpensive to boot. Second lunch - We both had the unlimited soup and salad. There were five salads and five soups to choose from. The day's special salads were excellent - One was sliced tomato/buffalo mozzarella cheese salad with a great vinaigrette, and the other was a watermelon and feta cheese salad. I also tried their wedge salad, which had thick-sliced bacon and chopped tomatoes over chunky blue cheese dressing. (The other two choices were house and Caesar, which I had before and were fresh and tasty).  The Chicken Tortilla soup is great. They bring out a bowl with fresh avocado, cheddar cheese and crisp tortilla strips and then pour the chicken soup into the bowl there at the table. It comes with a nice lime wedge, and all of the flavors together are SO GOOD. The clam chowder is almost like a ""stew,"" incredibly thick and just the right potato/clam ratio. Delicious.

475,T Z.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,,1.0,2014-01-06,"I've never written a bad review before, but I am inclined to share this experience, for those of us that do not look all prim and proper. I chose to watch the Niner game at Bj's, as my family was gone for the day, due to a death in a friends family. It was chilly, but I decided to ride my motorcycle, to have a little therapy as well. There is no good parking for a bike at this location, and I always have to worry about it, but chose it because they have big tv's, good beer, and I always thought a decent breakfast menu, I used to meet friends from out of town here after church, because it's close to the freeway and aways has had friendly service. As I finally got a decent parking spot, not to far from the front, I went in and got lucky with a decent seat at the bar. I asked for a menu, and it was, I noticed, 1:07 pm.. I asked the bartender if breakfast was still being served, and she said NO, brerakfast ends at 1pm, (that was 7 minutes ago) I said in my head. Ok it is what it is, the eggs must blow up at 1, hell I don't know. I put my leather coat on the chair, and leather gloves on the bar. I kept stepping away from time to time by the bathroom where I could hear the phone calls about the arraingments for the friend of the familes loss, then periodically going outside to check on my bike. Leaving my EXPENSIVE LEATHER COAT on my chair, and gloves, while each time covering my drink with a napkin. Mind you I'm very polite, and ALWAYS say please and thank you, and respect the service industry greatly, I always tip very big for good service, sometimes 10 or 20 dollars on a small check, if I have the money, because I know that is their income, and it's not easy. I noticed the two ladies kind of whispering, and glancing at me a couple times, mind you, I didnt have a hoodie on, and I was pretty much occupying a space there. Now I didn't order a bunch of drinks, or steak and lobster, my bill was a whopping 13 dollars, when I stood up about 45 minutes in, during a commercial to go check on my bike, thats when mizz bartender (I'll leave her name out, as she will know if she sees this, and if the boss reads these and cares, they will figure it out) decides to say, in front of EVERYBODY there, a full bar. ""IF YOUR GOING TO KEEP GETTING UP FROM YOUR CHAIR, I'M GOING TO NEED A CARD FROM YOU"". I smiled and said ""I'm checking on my motorcycle, because you have no safe place to park it, and my $500 dollar leathers are right here at my spot, I don't think I'll be leaving them for a 13 tab"". I never said another word about it, although it did change my whole attitude, about the moment, the two service ladies, and the people around me spoke about it some throughout the game, IT WAS VERY UNCALLED FOR. I've been in customer service for years, and if she or those two, were not observant enough to see my big azz leather jacket on my chair, gloves and helmet to boot, please have the class to not call a customer out in front of several other patrons. I also had asked to sample the three light beers, and asked if they had anything besides breast's for chicken. Maybe this was too much extra questions for them I don't really know. The game was great, and she couldn't ruin the taste of the few  beers, or the kool people around me. When everyone cleared an hour or so later, I found the manager on duty, and thanked him for letting me park where he did, I never mentioned my experience, was very tempted, but just chose not too. I finished my beer, taking my time, because I, of course wanted to make sure I wasn't buzzed, she did fill up my water about 10 times, maybe that was too much, again, don't know.  I gave her my American Express, and took the time to write a big ZERO on the tip line. and wrote in. You shouldn't judge people by what they look like, and basically embarass them in front of everyone. I usually tip big, God Bless !! :-)....... I think what really hurt, was the fact that I was being very polite, and we were all talking about other local places, and I was just REALLY taken aback by being called out like pond scum over a 13 dollar bill. It only cost her 10 bucks,s my bill was 29 dollars when all was said and done, but i all adds up, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one, ya never are. Moral: pay attention, if I was going outside with my leather jacket and helmet on, then maybe she would have had concern, or better yet, make a policy to give a card when the tab is started. DON'T EVER CALL GOOD PATRONS OUT, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU NOW IT WILL COST YOU HUNDREDS IN THE FUTURE.

I was not to be disappointed.  Well, I wasn't -- as I was.  To say the least about BJ's: they are consistent. We could hardly hear ourselves think as we sat in the cacophony of bar noise, news shows, and a few competing basketball and baseball games -- especially that from the loudspeakers of the establishment across the courtyard. The pizza looked okay, but like a photograph of a real pizza, it lacked real flavor, especially the tomato sauce.  Nothing remarkable about it other than its price.   The pizza was colder than the beer. My culinary companion du jour's salad looked like the oldest lettuce in Modesto.  After she picked out the few good bits from her salad, then she noshed on my cold pizza.   Cold pizza is the best, right? she asked... Fickle girl. Our server bounced up to our table and gaily asked if she could get us anything else?  I indicated that the meal was ghastly, and that we wanted to pay our check and get out.  As if I indicated that I really wanted to wanted to be further disappointed, she happily launched into her script asking if we wanted to try their fabulous desserts?  I shook my head (emphatically) no.  She knew all the lines of her script about the wonderful treats they had... while my date looked at the floor, chewing her lower lip to stop herself from saying something we'd both regret.

What I got was an arugula/brussells sprouts salad. I was told by the waitress that her manager told her the arugula was indeed kale.

Last night was our daughter's birthday, she selected BJ's as the location for her BDay dinner. We were hoping for an enjoyable experience to celebrate the occasion. When we walked in, the hostess took our information and indicated about a 10 minute wait. Interestingly, several large parties (8 or more) were called to be seated before us. No problem, they probably called ahead. The annoying part was, for all - only 1 or 2 from their party was present when called. So......why seat them when you have others waiting. After 25 minutes we were seated. Once seated, we were there at least 15 minutes before anyone ever came to the table to greet us, take a drink order, or anything for that matter. Once the server came, she apologized for the delay...someone called in sic...blah blah blah. Don't care - that is the manager's responsibility to call someone else in. It happens in businesses all over the country. One in our party ordered a root beer. 10 minutes after other drinks were brought, the server told us she had to go to the bar to get the soda. Okay - so go get it! The time spent to come tell us could have been better utilized to get the beverage. It arrived after we inquired twice more. Meal arrived, asked for ketchup...three times. After the third time, the party next to us was kind enough to give us their bottle of ketchup. These kind of actions continued to happen throughout. Our bill comes - it has charges for items we didn't order. Server says she has to find a manager for the correction. 10 minutes later, comes back to tell us the register had a malfunction and she needs a manager to assist with reprinting the bill receipt. She finally comes back and....extra chargers are still on there. SERIOUSLY....ARE YOU DUMB OR WHAT?????????? 1 hour and 45 minutes later our meal was finished. I hope BJ's corporate reads this. The food is good, we have been to other locations and the service has been better. The MODESTO location needs assistance, new management, better hiring practices, or SOMETHING?????

286,Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",49,258,271.0,2.0,2014-09-13,"REVIEW BASED OFF CATERING EXPERIENCE! Last weekend, I had my birthday party food catered from BJ's. It was pretty simple to do. I just went into the restaurant a few hours before my party and went to the take-out area to order it. I chose to order the Family & Friends Party Pack, $99.95. I added on the appetizer package as well for $33.95. The Family & Friends Pack serves about 10 people. It includes: 2 large Pizzas, 10 pieces of Balsamic Glazed Chicken Breast, 2 large Specialty or Enlightened Salads, 20 Chicken Wings, and 4 Party Sides. The Appetizer Package included two appetizers of your choice. I picked the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. I was VERY disappointed by all my catering.  When my boyfriend went to pick up all the food, they charged him for everything but they didn't put the Appetizer Package in any of the bags. He had to wait another 30 mins for them to make that which made him late bringing the food for the party while our guests had already arrived. That was MISTAKE #1. I had a few religiously, vegetarian guests therefore I ordered a vegetarian pizza and a vegetarian salad. When we served the food, someone noticed that there were small chunks of chicken in the VEGETARIAN salad!! How bad would that have been if my aunt who has been vegetarian for about 50 years ate meat for the first time because of a screw-up from BJ's?! MISTAKE #2. For the 4 Party Sides, we ordered two mashed potatoes, one of the baked potato option, and one rice pilaf. When we opened the Party Size Sides, we were in shock. The so called ""party sides"" that are supposed to be enough for 6-10 people were so ridiculously small! The two sides of mashed potatoes were like the smallest size of mashed potatoes you get from KFC (like the size of an ice cream scoop). How on earth does that feed 6-10 people?! The rice pilaf was of the same size. MISTAKE #3. Then we opened the box with the baked potatoes that were supposed to feed 6-10 people....it was ONE baked potato. How does ONE potato feed 6-10 people?! MISTAKE #4. When we opened the Mix & Match Appetizer and I quote from their website ""serves approx. 6-8 people"" ....the Spinach & Artichoke dip was SMALLER than a kid's size ice cream scoop from Baskin Robbins!! Explain to me BJ's how that can feed 6-8 people. The Avocado Egg Rolls were 3 egg rolls cut in half, making 6 pieces. MISTAKE #5.  For the amount of money we paid for all this food, it was not worth it at all. Glad I know now though! I called to let them know about all these problems especially about the vegetarian mistake and the manager sent me a $15 gift card for the $140 we spent on their food. My family & I will not  be ordering Party Packs from BJ's ever again & our guests won't be either as they saw how ridiculous all the portions were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=280,3.0,2.92,2.92,2.3760000000000003,2.9520000000000004

They insisted on lunch at BJ's after the tournament.  After looking at all of the weak reviews, especially regarding service, I was skeptical, but knew I was no match for 16 year olds that had pazooki desserts on their minds. BJ's had the typical lunchtime wait of about 25 minutes. We were prepared for a long wait for food, etc., so if the service was weak, it was not going to be a big surprise. The kids wanted to see the games on the big screen tv's, soak up the atmosphere of the restaurant and have a good time, regardless of the slow food service. In reality, the service was about as good as it gets. Our server had water to our table within a minute of our seating, took our order promptly, and the appetizer plate of avocado rolls was in front of us within minutes of ordering.  The rolls were fantastic. One of the girls ordered clam chowder, which was just about as good as you would hope to get at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  The meal service was truly perfect. The side salads were fresh and well prepared, and the main courses, of which we had three different at our table, were all excellent.  The water and drink glasses were kept constantly filled, the server was polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Dessert was no exception, the pazookies were brought to the table fresh from the oven. The restaurant was packed the entire time we dined, yet service was exceptional.

Well we hen you come up to a table and the person who was suppose to have his food has no plate in front of them ......  Finally 5 min later when everyone elses food was cold the burger arrived.

I was staying in Modesto with my girlfriend around Christmastime and we decided to hit up BJ's for dinner.  Despite my desire to look on the bright side of things, I cannot help but feel utterly disappointed with this place.  WHAT WENT WRONG 1. OLD FOOD BITS IN THE DIP -- It seems this location reuses their dip, because when we ordered appetizers (Santa Fe Spring Rolls) there was a piece of chicken already in the dip.  Pretty gross. 2. FOOD NOT AS DESCRIBED -- There was no avocado in my California burger, which pretty much ruined the experience.  Would have ordered something else if they were out of avocado, but apparently the servers were not aware of what was going on in the kitchen. 3. THEY CARD -- Despite my being WELL above the legal drinking age, I was asked for my ID.  4. RUDE, INATTENTIVE STAFF -- Server would come by and ask how we were doing, but not wait long enough to listen for an answer, rendering their having asked in the first place pointless. CONCLUSION On the bright side, the beer wasn't bad, and we were promptly seated in a booth as requested, but it definitely wasn't good enough to justify the bad experience.  The thought of old food in the dip makes me sick.  Never coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=180,2.64,2.9,2.9,2.18,2.7960000000000003

Food is always great and the decor is awesome. Looks very modern and I love all the tv's and chandeliers. Been here with the hubby a lot and he loves it as well. Been here with some girlfriends for lunch and dinner plus birthdays so this is an all around versatile restaurant for any occasion. Food wise, thin cut fries are the best! Sounds ridiculous to rave about something as simple as fries but they're awesome. White cheddar mashed potatoes are tasty as well. Hand breaded parm is delicious and well as their broccolli and chicken pasta. What I love is that no matter what you get whether it be a sandwich or a steak, the presentation is beautiful. My FAVORITE thing to eat here is the Pazooki! The red velvet is the best but they don't have it anymore so instead I get the white macadamia pazookie which is delicious!! Chicken tortilla soup is amazing. Pizza flatbread is good but enough to share between 2. If you're a group of 4 or more you'll get one thin small piece a person. Burgers are great they look amazing like the picture. Pizza is very popular there as well.  Service isn't bad. Its like anywhere else, it just depends. Most of the time I get great service with the exception of 1 time but management did a great job of redeeming themselves. Thats the great thing about bjs. They really care about your experience.

289,Brook G.,"Beaverton, OR",0,80,1.0,2.0,2015-01-17,"Let me first start out by saying that today's disaster could have been avoided if BJ's had ANY decent low-carb options on their menu. Even their salads have things like beans and corn and breaded chicken. Anything you order must be altered in order to get it to be a low carb meal. However, I have never been to this BJ's and been able to order a single thing (even non-low-carb) with a specialty (even just swapping the type of dressing on a salad or a side of anchovies with a pizza) without having an issue.  Apparently this BJ's specifically has a problem with specialty orders. Today, for example, I ordered the Toasted Turkey Bacon Sandwich. I ordered it on lettuce instead of bread, provolone instead of swiss, and no tomato. It came with a salad, so I ordered the salad with no tomato and no croutons.  The sandwich (now a lettuce wrap) came to me looking like they had thrown it together with spite because I had asked for it to be a special order. Then, I found that it had no mayo (it is supposed to come with it) and no cheese, on top of it looking disheveled. It also came with a side of ranch, which I couldn't figure out because I had not ordered that and the salads always come pre-dressed. My husband and I have been to many BJ's locations and have always been pleased with our service and our food, however we have been to this Modesto location several times and every single time they have messed up a specialty order, even if it is just ""add grilled chicken to my pasta"" or something simple like that.  I also had to ask for my salad twice after my main dish came, and each time I specified no croutons, no tomato. When I finally got it, it had tomato, which I picked off and ate without complaint because it was such a big deal that they finally got at least half of something right. Our server was nice about everything, although she could have avoided the comment about how ""I could have just ordered a salad as a meal"" because she clearly has not ever looked at the nutritional info of their menu.  I can't figure out if the wait staff just forgets because they never write anything down, the kitchen staff is angry and spiteful because of a picky order (sorry, there are people who have special dietary needs which BJ's fails to cater to!), or if the kitchen staff is on autopilot and never gets a special order correct because they don't know how to break pattern.  I won't be coming back to this location. I know from experience that a customer's picky order can be frustrating, but it is also frustrating for a customer to have to sit down at their favorite restaurant and not be able to order their favorite meal because of new health restrictions. I also hope that BJ's some day comes out with a couple of low carb options on their menu. It would be much easier than trying to customize an order and dealing with frustrated staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=280,2.72,2.91,2.91,2.504,2.8340000000000005

I'm not sure if my tastebuds are more refined now that I'm older, but this BJs was a true let down. I've been to many BJs in Southern California and the two that I've tried here, Modesto and Livermore have been awful. So let me start with the egg rolls. They tryin' to be Cheesecake Factory or what? Doesn't even come close, especially if you leave the end pits inside two of the egg rolls! No excuse. I bit into one and my husband bit into the other. All downhill from there. While ordering, our waiter had asked me if I wanted wedges or skinny fries and I chose the skinny. He also asked how I wanted my burger done, and I said 'well.'

It took an unusually long time to get our food which seemed odd being the restaurant wasn't that crowded yet, but someone did come to the table and apologized for the wait. Food overall was good. Portion size generally matched the price the price point, except for the steaks which were severely undersized for the price point. (We ordered a New York and sirloin). The weight on the menu for the New York steak is deceiving. It states the steak is a 16oz, but is bone in, which means much of the weight is attributed to the bone. This is not restaurant industry standard for a New York cut. The sirloin didn't list a size on the menu, but when it came to the table, it looked like a 6 oz. Very disappointing. For the price point, we were expecting a piece of meat about double in size. We felt misled. Side portions with the steak dishes were very small for the price point. Waiter was attentive, however.

On my wife's birthday, we came in with a group of about 10 family members.  We called ahead and showed up early, and the hosting staff told us it would be about 45 minutes wait after we arrived.  We weren't seated for over 2 hours.  More than half of the food ordered at our table had to be sent back.  Dishes were cold, unseasoned, and/or entirely wrong.  I chalked this one up to a fluke. We tried to go back for my wife's baby shower.  I called 6 hours in advance to see if they thought they could seat 7.  The hostess was quite short with me and said she would check with a manager.  After being on hold for 9 minutes, another person picked up the phone and asked how they could help.  I repeated my request, and said that someone was checking with the manager.  This employee told me the manager was in a meeting and would return my call within 15 minutes.  I didn't hear back, so I called an hour later.  The first employee answered the phone.  I repeated my request yet again.  She snapped at me and told me that they would not be able to accommodate us at all that evening, but that we were welcome to ""come by and walk the dining area.""  I was confused, and said ""no, thank you"" and that we would ""look for another place to eat.""

Although the service was terrible, the worst by far that I've ever experienced. I wish I remembered his name but he didn't ever introduce himself like a proper waiter would have. It took him about 20mins to take our drink order another 15 for them to come out. Then another 15 to take our order, keep in mind there are only myself and another in the party. So a total of 2 and it took a total of 50 mins to get our late lunch started. I believe he took the opportunity to judge us as being the young couple that would be less generous in the end tip,because he continued to avoid us, avoid eye contact, avoid refilling our drinks. He continued to serve his larger parties, no hesitation but it took us to turn our heads and raise our hands to get any of his attention. But there was no hesitation to rush us out of his section because he continuously ask if the bill was ready to be taken care of, while we were still enjoying our dessert. Not sure if he thought we'd dine and dash or was about to clock out but any server should know if a check is ready to be taken care of, then it'd be on the edge of the table or standing up. Like I said I wished we remembered his name but this mishap took place on Sunday the 9th of August around 4pm and we're  seated on the second row of two top booths farthest from the bar, fourth booth down.

Minus the fact that it wasn't busy and we waited over an hour for our food, we got our drinks well after our appetizer came out. Our waitress was not the best and her attitude seemed somewhere else rather than to the customer. The food this time was just okay, and our food came out one plate at a time and 10 mins apart!! We ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl and at first they brought it out in a bowl, then we told them that we ordered the bread and the boy (not our waiter) we extreme nice about it, but the surprise came when we got it back, they reduced the size of the BOWL of soup to a cup. I have never seen clam chowder in such a little portion before. They said they use a ""new device"" to make the hole in the bread.. The new ""device"" seems more to me like the top of a cup..

So it's a Sunday night. The place is decently busy but it seems like everyone around us is getting their food and not having any problems. There is an ample amount of waiters and bus boys so this isn't a situation of being understaffed.  We order our food with this great waiter, and then someone else comes over and tells us he's taking over and the other guy is going on break. Whatever. Think nothing of it.  This guy was not necessarily rude... But not nice or pleasant at all. No smiles. Only business and there to get the job done. Which is fine! But don't expect a tip for your lack of service.  Our food comes out.... 45 minutes later- everything except for my friends soup..  - and our waiter comes over and tell us ""your soup will be right out! They're finishing it."" 5 minutes goes by... He comes by again at least three more times ""your soup will be out in two minutes!"" 5 minutes later- ""they're pouring it and giving it to me now"" - 10 minutes later- finally she gets her soup.  Also, it took 10 minutes for my friend to get her ranch. That she asked for with her meal order. Then asked for when we got our food. Then it finally came- after he walked by at least four times to do other things- with my friends soup.  So it's an hour after we've sat, and we didn't take too long to order- it was relatively normal timing. Anyway, so we get that. Then we order some dessert. A pazookie! We get that 25 minutes later. And then finally the guy comes by with our checks.  I should have asked for the manager sooner but I didn't want to stir the pot and was wishful thinking, having some hope in BJ's. But I finally did and he gave us some free pazookie certificates. But it was my fault that I spoke to the manager after our bills were paid.  But our service was just so terrible. I'm only in Modesto twice a year and for 2 days at a time. I don't want to waste my time sitting at BJ's, waiting for the damn waiter who keeps lying to us about the soup! Fine, if it's going to take longer, don't tell us ""2 minutes."" Be honest. And apologize about it.  We were there for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes. As a party of four. The table that had 7 across from us came after us, had dinner and dessert just as we did-left before us. They had a different waiter.   I don't know if I'll return to BJ's. I think there are much better establishments in Modesto that I'd rather give my money to, when I am in town.

Our server was very friendly and took our order quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I went with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken to compare it with the one here in town. My girl went with a mini vegetarian pizza and we both split wedge cut fries. Their french fries are good. She suggested them. If you're eating a vegetarian meal and want good fried food, try the wedge fries! By the time our food came out, the restaurant was starting to fill up with more and more people. The lunch crowd was finally arriving! Luckily we were well into our meal to where our ticket wasn't put into a queue with a lot of people in front of us. My food tasted the same as the Stockton location. They even slack by giving you a tiny portion of broccoli. I've always joked about there being a shortage of broccoli in the back at the Stockton Location. I can confirm it's standard to ship this dish out with a small amount of vegetables. I asked to get a side of broccoli to get a good portion of veggies with my meal. Instead of looking at the plate and acknowledging the short portion, she didn't have a problem charging me around $4 for the side of broccoli (photographed below).  Complaining aside, the food tasted fine. Neither of us had a problem with the staff, and the waiting time was minimal for our food, getting seated, and getting our drinks.

I'm obviously a frequent customer at curbside and there's only been 2 instances where my service was just terrible to say the least. When you order through the app, you get a link to do a survey after you've received your food. I normally give high ratings and praise for everything so when those 2 separate times came around and my rating was lower than normal, the managers listened! I did not expect any kind of monetary gain from the surveys (and honestly doubted anyone read them) but when I informed them each separate time about the bad service through those surveys, I got a curtesy gift card and apology from the manager.

Ever hear of heavy cream and real cheese people.  Service was scripted like every other chain, so dont expect any personality from your server because its obvious it must be against corporate rules. Obviously from watching other tables complain it occurred to me this is a chain that goes for massive sales, comping complainers and at the end somehow ink out a profit.  I recommend staying away from this place and going to an independent for your family night out.  It can't be worse and likely much cheaper.

Four thirty on a Friday and service felt slow.  I had soup, which was good but it was just barely like warm. I also had the root beer glazed ribs. The sauce on the ribs was really good, unfortunately the ribs were burnt and crunch. A little char is good on a rib but these unfortunately were burnt. The side of Asian slaw was to hot for me and the cabbage was limp, inedible. My friend had some kind of bacon brisket burger, it wasn't very appealing and he said it was just ok. He said it wasn't as good as those he's had in the past.  This place has always been hit and miss for food. I guess this was one of those miss times.

Except for the caprees sandwich my daughter ordered.. that was amazing!!  I don't think complaining would have done any good because by the time my food was redone, my daughter would have ate hers already.

It was cold and stale. Whatever we were so hungry we didn't even say anything. Then comes our food, let's forget about how long it took to finally get to us. The food was cold and nasty. Two of our friends were told they were out of what they ordered. Of course they waited until everyone's food was out to say something. My friends didn't want to wait and just said they didn't want anything. I could barely swallow my burger because of how dry my throat was. Whatever. We dealt with it.

It wasn't until I actually found a piece of calamari in with my fries that I realized what the problem was.  I immediately called the waitresses attention to which she responded by calling over a manager. I don't remember his name, but he was rude. So rude. He basically said that I should have asked if they cooked any of their food with what I was allergic to. Seriously? That is not my responsibility. You as the establishment serving the food, need to notify or at least state a warning somewhere clearly in the menu.  We paid the bill and headed towards the door, I needed an epinephrine pen and a cold bath for the swelling. As we were about to walk out the door he sarcastically stopped me and handed me a card that was a coupon for 10% off my next meal. As if I planned to return? He was rude through the entire ordeal and had no sympathy.  I even contacted corporate. This happened a while ago and I contacted corporate promptly and haven't heard back from them either.

I told her if that's the case I'll have fish and chips. Waited and waited. All of a sudden another waitress comes up and tells us she's gonna take care of us for the night.

Large corporate restaurants always have this challenge of not becoming too bureaucratic and rule based rather than consumer oriented. It tends to take good management to not lose that aspect. In this case, management is failing. Table prep was hasty with no sweetener on the table. Certain sections were completely empty and yet the hostess refused to open them and was offering 25 - 30 minute waits instead (and this is at 5.00 pm on a Friday so it still wasn't rush dinner time).The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Run of the mill offerings, though I do like their avocado spring rolls (what I mainly came for). I wasn't disappointed in them, but I was a little disappointed with my salad. The Ahi tuna portion wasn't generous and the salad hadn't been tossed properly, so all the dressing was at the bottom. They got the spouses first burger wrong but eventually fixed the problem. And the bill without drinks was over 50 bucks.. a little too expensive for a medium end corporate chain.

I didn't say anything once again because I had already waited a long time for my food to come out. dessert was good however when he dropped the bill off he didn't discount the half off pizza since it was Monday night their and had charged us regular price I had him correct that for me.

What makes a difference is how it's address and handled when it does happen. This is where they failed in my experience. I ordered the tuna seared salad specifically because it has avocado in it and I was having a crazy craving for it. When it was delivered, no avocado. I kindly informed my server and she graciously apologized and took it back. When my second salad arrived (delivered by someone other than my server) it had no avocado in it. When my server returned to check in I told her and she was embarrassed at the point. She offered to take it back... I suggested she bring me a side of avocado. She agreed, apologized again, and said she would have a manager come by my table. Well, that never happened. You'd think this would be a time that would warrant it. Who knows what happened, maybe she told the manager, maybe she didn't, maybe the manager stepped out, who knows, there's the human being factor again, right? Will I return there next time I'm in town, likely. However, I hope the manager reads these reviews and hopefully will use it as a training opportunity as to what to do when this happens... servers should treat things like this as ""mission critical"" and send someone, anyone, by the table and ""act"" like a manager to apologize.

136,M P.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,3.0,2.0,2017-09-25,"We decided to eat here for lunch on Sunday, showed up close to 12:30 pm. We had a group of 7 so we knew there would be a wait. We checked in with the hostess, she tells us it will be 20 minutes and asks if we want to receive a text message when our table is ready. We say yes, enter in our phone number for the text and go outside to wait on the bench. About 15 minutes later we get a text saying our table is ready. We go inside, let the hostess know we got the text and she asks us to wait over by the side. The place she had us stand to wait for our table happened to be the stroller corral, so we were squishing together each time a new stroller was parked. We waited in the stroller corral for over 5 minutes while they sat several more customers. Finally, I ask who I assume was the manager (she was ordering the hostess and waitresses around) what we were waiting on since we received a text message that our table was ready. She jumped down my throat saying she called our name 3 times and we didn't answer so they gave our table away. I asked why she called us when we asked for the text message. At first she said she didn't know we wanted to be text messaged but when I called her out on that (considering we got a text message from them) she became even angrier and started arguing with me that we should have heard her calling our name and should have answered her if we wanted to be seated. She also asked why we didn't text them back to let them know we were coming in! What the hell??! We were literally right outside the front door and walked in as soon as we got the text! She was rude and extremely argumentative. I am NOT one of those ""the customer is always right"" person, but in this case, she was flat out wrong. We followed what they offered, a text service to notify when the table was ready. We weren't asked to text back, we walked right in and then we were berated by this so-called manager. We cancelled our table request and walked right across the way to Buffalo Wild Wings, had great food and great service. We were seated within 5 minutes on game day Sunday at 1 pm.

The last time I was there for dinner, it took 40 minutes and the steak was so covered with black pepper (after I told them light on the seasoning), scraping it off wouldn't even make it edible. the waiter took it back, but never even so much as asked if I wanted anything else until he brought the bill, and we were ready to leave. I had honestly thought that since he didn't ask if I wanted something else, they were going to correct the problem and bring me another steak. It's also one of the few restaurants that doesn't offer any bread with dinner, you actually have to pay for it. A few weeks before that, I tried their spaghetti which was worse than something you would find in the freezer section of the local grocery store.

The tortilla chips were stale, the cheese curds chewy, no dressing on the salad and the cookie was so cold it actually kept the ice cream from melting. On top of all that, it took us over an hour to receive these, and they are all appetizers other than the salad.  Our server kind of apologized, you can tell she'd been apologizing for quite some time now.

We've had some hits and misses on the food and service but 99% of the time their right on perfect. They have a great crew such as Teo, Yvonne, and Micala.  We have had so many dish here: California club flatbread impressive tasting; Margherita Fresca flatbread, it's OK, I like meat on my pizza. Chicken wings are as good as their neighbor's, Chili and Sriracha Queso is delicious; Seared Ahi salad was good but would liked a little more ahi on it; Mahi-Mahi tacos very tasty, a favorite of mine; Honey-Sriracha Brussel sprouts smell and taste like Brussels sprouts, not my favorite, didn't order that again; Hickory Brisket and bacon was good, strong BBQ sauce flavor; Bacon-Guacamole deluxe burger was awesome; our favorite is their Piranha nachos doctored up....AMAZING. They have great beers such as the Tatonka, Jeremiah Red and the host other brewery's beers.. Back again got to meet a new bartender, Angela, really sweet and great services.   Tio and kitchen staff did an amazing job on our nachos. Back again, We have been to other BJ's location and the food has been good.  However we really enjoy the crew at the Modesto location.....good people.  We are always met with smiles and true kindness.    It just a great group if people: Chris, Tio, Oscar, Elliott,  Micala, and",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto,3.04,2.55,2.688,,2.7460000000000004

However, our last visit we had such great customer service we decided to write a review. There actually was  a mishap with our order and for some odd reason our pizza was taking a little longer than expected. The manager Sarah went above and beyond to make it right and made our experience worth the wait. Along with the attentive service with management our server (lizzeth D) was so sweet and very apologetic for the mishap. She made sure our drinks were always filled and always asked if we needed anything every time she passed the table. We have three small children so something always comes up and she was willing to get everything we needed. We really appreciate the service they gave our family and reminded us how costumer service should be!

56,David W.,"San Clemente, CA",0,6,,1.0,2017-11-09,"I was visiting Modesto a couple of weeks ago and went to BJ's because I eat there often in Orange County, where I live. Normally BJ's is great, but this particular one has some serious staffing problems. The server barely paid attention to our table. My drink came in a glass that was dirty. I asked to add bacon to my burger and they didn't. While we were eating, the manager (I didn't get her name but she was below average height and died blonde hair), was actually yelling at one of the customer right in front of everyone. I was absolutely shocked that a manager would behave this way. I will continue to go to BJ's but just not this particular one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=40,2.96,2.6,2.704,,2.744

He said we would be seated shortly, but after noticing a bunch of other parties that got there after us, were being seated first, we let the host know again. Finally after another 15 minutes, we actually got seated. Thankfully the food was good and the server was attentive.

So sad and pathetic. The daytime servers are rude anyways I come in every Sunday and its so easy to hear all the side talk about how everyone is being jipped and its so sad because the food runners are so much more nicer than the servers sometimes.

Told it would be 10 min wait for a table but could go to bar as well.  The bar was busy due to happy hour.   But I found a seat.  Sat there for over 10mins.  The two bartenders were too busy filling drink orders from waitstaff they never knowledge me or anyone at the bar for that matter.  So I leave and go back to wait for a table at front desk.  Finally get seated after another 5 mins.    Waited at table without being seen for 15 mins.   So I left.... ridiculous,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=20,2.84,2.62,2.676,,2.708
22,Liz H.,"Modesto, CA",0,46,,2.0,2017-11-22,"Really, BJ's?! You went from being one of my favorite chain restaurants to the bottom of the barrel. Tonight is the night before Thanksgiving. So as not to mess up my kitchen, and because I had a gift card, and as a treat for my kids and grandkids, we decided to go to BJ's for dinner.  I called for a reservation early in the day, but was told it was not an option. So our party of seven, five adults and 2 kids arrived at 5:30. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. No problem. Then we waited and waited, and waited.  After an hour we told the host we would be okay with being split up. And then we sat there while over 20 smaller parties were seated. We were told a party of eight was done and should be leaving soon. Only they didn't.  Finally my son in law asked for a manager. She told us appetizers would be comped and took the orders for the kid's drinks and dinner. After we were finally seated, an hour and a half after arrival, our waiter told us again and again how our lousy service was not his fault. Maybe so, but the delivery of the pre-ordered kid's meals took forever and our dinners took even longer, and did not come out together. Then my daughter made the grievous error of ordering dessert, and me, a second glass of wine. We waited, and waited, and waited.  Thank Goodness the two toddlers were well behaved! But our 'treat' turned into a complete ordeal.  Not happy. Not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=20,2.84,2.63,2.664,,2.7139999999999995

We just asked for extra silverware and that seemed liked it had just been rinsed. I woke up ok the next day but brother and friend was very very sick next day. Not coming here again.

The reason for the two stars was the sad, soggy, COLD, chicken club and bottom of the barrel fries. I picked the sandwich apart looking for something edible because I was starving. We paid the bill 20% tip because it wasn't the waitresses fault. The bathroom was nasty. Water/urine on the floor, clogged bathrooms, paper towels everywhere. No seat covers in my daughters stall. Kind of bummed. I have never had a bad experience at BJs over here in Brentwood.

I placed my order, when I get there the curbside parking is full with empty cars. So I call and ask where do I park? The lady on the phone was very rude, called me out of my name twice and then hung up on me. Then she comes out with my food, hands it to me, wasn't friendly at all and after she takes my payment I proceed to look into the bag and notice that my Cesar salad was actually a house salad with Cesar dressing. How hard is it to make a Cesar salad?! I also got a burger with fries and ""Cesar salad"" so I tried a fry and to my not so likely surprise it was cold. When I get home about 10 min away. And guys I understand food isn't going to be super hot like it just came outta the kitchen but my chicken fried steak burger was cold. I'm talking like my melted cheese was cold like you melt it and stick it in the fridge then serve it. Not to mention that I think the burger itself was undercooked, almost raw.

Today I wanted to buy my employee's lunch for working New Years and placed a order online. When I got there to pick up they did not have my order. I had a print out and confirmation of the order. I has told that 2 of the four items were sold out, but they could start making the other items now if I wanted to wait. Had to go back and tell everyone that lunch was not on me, because BJ's can't seem to get anything right. Shame on me for trying this place again.

Who was also incredibly slow but at least she was nice.
