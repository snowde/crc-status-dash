If you don't like a dish, just let them know and they will try their best to get you something else. I.E. I ordered the Mediterranean Pizza and it was too sour for my taste due to the excessive olives and peppercinis so our waiter checked with the manager and I was able to order a different pizza without charge. Awesome! Lastly, they have a wide variety of beers, martinis, cocktails, and mocktails so I'm sure anyone will be able to find something that they enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=400,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.056,3.2800000000000002

Guess up until the last time,we were both pleased and never cared much to change our meeting place.  HOWEVER, this last time, we met for breakfast, instead of our normal lunch.   All I have to say is breakfast there was close to awful.  Scrambled eggs were cold... as if they had been made a day ahead and just sat there waiting to hop on someone's plate.  I was starving and after taking 3 bites, decided to send them back.  You know what they say about sending food back, so I hesitated at first, but asked them to just bring me some hot, fresh ones. My friend's order was totally wrong.  She ordered a veggie scramble thing that was on the brunch menu, but instead got normal day old scrambled eggs and bacon.  The waitress seemed quite confused... maybe she was new, so ok, I guess, but this is the very first time I decided to write a review on this BJ's.  Unfortunately, it's not as good as it would have been had I not had breakfast there. We complimented on how good the coffee was though and the waitress said she'd find out the brand, but .. of course, never came back to tell us.  Still good ambiance and we always feel comfortable over-staying our welcome, especially since we drove so far to meet. Since I do love breakfast, maybe I'll giver it another try sometime, but probably not for ""awhile"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=260,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9240000000000004,3.1600000000000006

They always have four or five of their own beers on tap.  I really like their amber ale.  They have some good seasonal brews, too, so ask, if they don't tell you. The menu is a bit huge.  What's their specialty?  They have pizzas (appetizer and full size), soups, salads, seafood, steaks, pasta, burgers, and sandwiches.  Everything I've had here is really good, but not quite stand-out/excellent. They have lots of TVs, including a giant-screen one over the bar. If you're watching the game, there are few bad seats.

I figured we'd be in and out pretty fast, boy was a I surprised there. There were plenty of servers as our area had 2 for the 4 tables they served. It took a mere 2 minutes before we placed our drink and appetizers, but it took 20 minutes (ya I was actually watching the clock at this point) to get our drinks, and 47 minutes to get the appetizer (was an order of spinach artichoke dip). The appetizer was not brought to us by our server so we had to wait almost 10 minutes before we could place our order. So being there an hour all we saw was an appetizer and the 2 drinks we ordered (ya no refills occurred). Almost exactly 45 minutes later we received our meal (Hamburger and fries for me [nothing complicated], and a calazone [real simple]), that was 45 more minutes without a refill even after trying to flag our server down several times. The food was alright, it was still not very crowded and I am beginning to know why. We almost went to the Buffalo Wild Wings across the street, and we really should have.

I'm not sure why, but it just seems below par in comparison to the rest of the chains I've been to. So, I went here before a movie with a date I was with. Well, they cooked our steaks wrong. Not only wrong, but it didn't even look like it was edible, so we asked for another and explained why, they didn't charge us but we were there for about two and a half hours. The wait time is always terrible, the waiters often seem indifferent and can never remember who ordered what ( when there are only two people at the table, it just looks bad on their part). I only come to BJ's if I want dessert, personally.

419,Jill C.,"Redlands, CA",54,6,,5.0,2012-11-29,"I've always loved BJs. The service at this location has always been friendly and quick, they have good food, great beer, and a cool environment. However, they almost ALWAYS got my order wrong. After a number of disappointing experiences at this location (Probably because I have a really neurotic order!), I emailed management to let them know how I felt. This is what I wrote: ""I have been a patron at your BJ's location for over four years. Over those four years, I have visited your store one to three times a month. I have ordered the same pizza every time, and 3 out of 5 times, my order is incorrect. My favorite pizza in the entire world is BJ's buffalo chicken pizza with no onions, no celery, and no barbecue sauce. Sometimes your staff know that your buffalo chicken pizza recipe calls for a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down, but most of the time they do not. I have been argued with, I have been told I am wrong, and I have been patient with your staff for a very long time. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made an issue of this. However, when I ordered my pizza with specific instructions last night, paid 25 dollars for it, and received it with BBQ sauce again, I decided it was time to speak up. My only request is that you make your staff knowledgable about your buffalo chicken pizza recipe, so that when I come back and order again, I don't have to feel like your staff thinks I'm an idiot and an obnoxious customer."" One of the managers, Brandy, was quick to respond, very kind and understanding, and even sent us a gift card! We've been back several times since, and our order has been perfect.

Who does that???? That is just disgusting and unprofessional right there. I'm guessing one of chefs was pissed that day or something, they just wanted to play games or was too lazy to throw their gum away. So our server took the Jambalaya off our bill and got 2 free Pizookie which was cool. Overall, the service was great, I don't know about the chefs working in the back.

It's not as if BJ's is exactly fine dining, but it is always so ridiculously busy as if it was lol - if it wasn't busy all the time I would probably go more often, but since it is always busy I go every few months or so.  If you're going to BJ's, especially on the weekend or a holiday, plan on waiting at least 20 minutes even if you call ahead.  I made the mistake of going on Valentine's Day because I wanted a drink, they have a bar, and the peach frost I got there last time was delicious - plus we are in love with the ahi poke tuna appetizer, seriously, the best appetizer they have - but even that was not up to par.   Pretty much everything I put in my mouth was bad. We got the ahi poke, it was good, but not as great as usual.  First bad sign.  I ordered a drink and it took 10 minutes and when I got it, it was the ABSOLUTE WORST PINA COLADA EVER MADE.  I've ordered food before, my plate be completely wrong, and not sent it back because I dont like to make a fuss haha, but I just had to send that back.  I got their house favorite drink, the strawberry splash, and they couldnt even make that taste good nor was it fully blended.  Pretty much, they both tasted like vodka blended with some ice.  I didn't ask to send it back but the waitress saw that I wasnt drinking it and insisted so she brought me a strawberry mojito because it is her favorite drink - I didnt like that either, but I drank it so she wouldnt feel bad lol and we tipped her extra for caring so much.  Whoever was the bartender on Valentine's Day night is HORRIBLE.  I also ordered a tomato bisque because their's is my second favorite in the area after Romano's, it was as good as usual.  And for my entree I ordered the chicken limone which I have gotten before - it had no flavor at all, I wasnt even sure if the sauce was really on there, and it made me feel a little sick later too.  So the service was great, but like I always say, I dont go out to places for service, I go to restaurants to eat, and it was just not good - not good at all.

That said, BJ's in Moreno Valley is a great restaurant/bar to go grab something to eat or drink, whether you want a big meal, something light, or just some beer. The Happy Hour menu has great bargains, anchored by their half-priced Mini-Pizzas. The lunch menu is also a great bargain with lots of under $10 options. Lunch beer prices are $3.50 for any BJ's house brews, which are, in my opinion, surpass the other beers they have on draft (or bottle).  BJ's usually has at least two seasonal/limited beers (which change every couple of months) at any given time and you should always make an effort to try them. This BJ's location also opens at 10am on weekends and provides a 'brunch' menu. Their brunch menu is solid and they have some good breakfast/brunch selections. As far as the MoVal location, the bartenders are great. I may be biased because I'm a regular, but I find that they give more attention than the other BJ's locations' bartenders. BJ's in general is a great value in terms of food (good pricing, wide selection) and alcohol (great in-house beers).

Either my taste buds are suuuper different or BJs changed up their flavors. The most recent time I was here, the food was kinda awful :( Here are the items I ordered:  1. Avocado eggrolls- 5/10, not that bad. The sauce was too sweet though, so I ended up  adding some salt and pepper to spice up the sauce lol  2. Buffalo chicken pizza- 1/10. EWWWW. Seriously, BJs, you GOTTA take this item off your menu because it is inedible. The buffalo sauce was so powerful that it STUNG my nose. In the end, I just picked off the bits of chicken and ate that instead.  3. Tuscan chicken limone: 1/10. Another dish we regretted ordering. I was hoping it to be just a hint of lemon, but each bite of the pasta was like eating a single piece of lemon.  4. Pizookie: 10/10! If you're dining at BJs and you don't get this, then you're missing out big time! What is a pizookie, you ask? It's basically a yummy , warm, melty cookie with a scoop of delicious ice cream on top!! BJs has several different flavors to choose from. I ordered their newest one, salted caramel, which was AMAZINGGG.  So I definitely recommend this!

It took her ten minutes to bring us water, another ten minutes to come back after that to take our orders, and twenty-five minutes after receiving our food to refill drinks. Also, our silverware was dirty and she gave us attitude because she had to give us a new set.

There were 3 girls, at the front with their backs to the door talking and laughing with a male worker. He noticed us and sat us right away. First of all my husband ordered a Long Island iced tea and it was terrible. Our appetizer, the carnitas fries had two small chunks of carnitas and a small amount of the chile verde sauce. It was good, just seemed like they skimped on the meat and sauce.  My husband ordered some sort of avocado burger and it came with two tiny slivers of avocado. Are they on a low supply here? The mozzarella/tomato salad with mini pizza lunch special was fine.  We ordered the triple mini pizooki dessert and found a LONG BLACK HAIR in one pizooki.  I'd have a picture but the waitress came over before I was able to get one...lol. I am assuming the manager came over and apologized....she didn't identify herself but she apologized and took the pizooki off the bill.

201,Christopher M.,"Orange, CA",1,59,5.0,1.0,2014-12-21,"Not sure what was worse today, the cleanliness, food, or the service. When we sat down at our booth there was the unpleasant odor of rank bar.  You know, that smell of a gross dive bar.  Either the drains are backed up or the bar is just not clean but it is not appealing. As for the food, the Mahi Mahi with pineapple fried rice was so oily we sent it back. Oddly the waitress chose to bring a plate of half cooked brown rice in return.  That's what one gets for assuming a new order of rice with pineapple and other veggies would be the replacement.  The new lasagna is a mockery of its namesake; its just cheese ravioli in a pan with no flavor. The menu said it would have sausage.  It had two pieces like you would have on a pizza. The sauce had a canned metallic flavor.  We both left half our food behind.  As for service, besides the rice debacle, the waitress was completely incapable of getting our drinks right.  I ordered diet coke, my friend a regular coke.  They started off reversed and every refill she failed to bring the right version mixing them up over and over.  The other notable issue was after the food was delivered, the obligatory food check was skipped leaving us for about 5-10 minutes while we were not happy making the fried rice debacle more like adding insult to injury.

I noticed the waitresses glancing over and looking at me but they kept walking away and doing other things or not even acknowledging  me at all. A lady finalllyyyyyy came and asked me if i needed help ( she looked at me as if I was a BUM -__-). I told her about my glasses and she called her manager. He came out and said im sorry they are not here. Then I told him to please look again since I had called and someone had put them away for me. He came back 10 minutes later apologizing and saying he found them.

My friend's steak was overcooked, my appetizer was put in to come out with my meal, my husband's burger came out overdone with no bacon (add bacon was specifically requested), and old fries. My pizza was doughy and undercooked. The waitress said the bacon mishap was her fault cause she put the order in wrong and offered my husband a free dessert. He asked for the beignet. She left and came back saying she wasnt allowed to give him the beignet because it has ""fresh strawberries and cooked dough"" ...hmmm really? and he had to pick a pizzookie.  He wasnt really wanting that so he said nevermind. She said you can talk to the manager to see if she'll approve it. So he said okay, mainly to discuss all the other issues. The manager, Vera, took awhile to come talk to us, and when she did and listened to all the issues, she seemed very unphased and offered us the beignet and then asked if we were done. Tammy could have talked to the manager for us and spared us the explanation for some beignets. The manager could have at least seemed half interested and been a little more apologetic.

My latest call hold time... 9 minutes the first time and 13 minutes the second.  NO ONE EVER ANSWERED!  I finally gave up.    When picking up orders, I'm very rarely ever greeted by the to-go server and then when someone else says ""someone will be right with you"", I end up sitting around for another 10 minutes as I watch all of the servers chatting away amongst one another.  When I recently ordered several items for a large group, my pizza wasn't ready upon arrival and I was told I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  WHY, when I ordered 40 minutes prior and the other five meals were ready??  The server couldn't (or wouldn't) answer me.  When I asked to speak to the manager, I was finally told that my pizza had been dropped and they had to make a new one.  OK, fine, shizz happens, but why not just tell me the truth and offer a drink or something while I'm waiting?  Even that didn't happen when the manager got involved.   So, unfortunately, as much as I really do like the pizza at BJ's, I definitely won't be returning to this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=160,3.28,3.27,3.27,2.5320000000000005,3.274

456,Renee H.,"Riverside, CA",18,48,21.0,2.0,2015-07-15,"Yesterday we called in a to-go order for two buffalo chicken pizzas. They were ready quickly (within 10-15 minutes) and were nice and hot. When we got home to eat them they did not taste like the usual buffalo chicken pizza we get from BJs. We ONLY go to BJs for their buffalo chicken pizza. Granted we do not visit on a routine basis, but I'd think we know the pizza well enough. This time the time the buffalo sauce was mixed with BBQ sauce. You could taste more BBQ than buffalo! I don't know if maybe they changed their recipe for the buffalo chicken pizza or if they were just running low on buffalo sauce so they substituted with BBQ???, Either way we were pretty disappointed.  Usually the pizza is spicy for me and I have to use plenty of ranch (which is no big deal, I prefer it) but not this time. I didn't have to use one drop of ranch because the BBQ overpowered the buffalo sauce so much. If the cooks did this because they were running low on buffalo sauce I wish they would have said something instead of just giving us something made incorrectly and hope we wouldn't notice. Makes me wonder if they would do the same to dine-in customers, or only to-go customers?  I will state that the pizza was not terrible, but it was not great either and certainly NOT what we were expecting. It was very disappointing. Definitely not expecting a BBQ chicken pizza with a little bit of buffalo sauce when you order buffalo chicken pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220,3.2,3.26,3.26,2.3760000000000003,3.2360000000000007

He never came back. 10 mins later we flagged down another waitress and asked to speak to the manager, while she was getting the manager another waitress came to our table and advised us that our waiter went home and she was taking over....  A couple minutes later the manager came out carrying our pizza and apologized for the delay of our pizza.

I came to celebrate my roommate's 21st birthday and despite the fact that they could not make reservations for us on the day of the event, we decided to come around 9pm to try our luck with seating. After waiting about half an hour for a party of 8, we were seated in a relatively slow section--which I always take for a good sign since that means faster service! I forget the name of our server but I suppose it doesn't matter. Her lackluster personality and unprofessional behavior made it hard for me to take her seriously. She didn't card half of my party and the other half only got carded because they had their IDs out. I find this very unprofessional and unsafe as underage guests could have just as easily ordered alcoholic beverages without her knowledge. I'd be a little more careful with a liquor license, but since she was complaining about how late she was working I guess she didn't care about getting the company in trouble either.  The food, on the other hand, was quite delicious! I ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup for $5.95 and though I wish it was a little less creamy it sure hit the spot. For my alcohol of choice I started with a Blood Orange Pom Sangria for $8.25 and a Piranha Pale Ale for $5.50 afterwards. The sangria would've tasted much better without the Fireball whiskey in it but regardless it still did the job.  Towards the end of the night I asked our server for the check. She came back about ten minutes later and took a seat next to me, only to start complaining about how tired she was because she went out the night before and was so hungover that working that day was just a regrettable decision. I asked her how long she had been working and she said 4 hours. I couldn't tell what I found more off putting, the fact that she blatantly did not care about how terrible her behavior was or how badly she portrayed the employees of this restaurant. Either way, I was not impressed.  When we finally got our bill, she got one thing correct: my roommate's birthday. Despite the amount of times we asked her for Parmesan cheese and a myriad of other condiments, at least she managed to bring the birthday pizookie out.  Overall, I am very disappointed in this restaurant. I understand that employees are only human, but considering the fact that her section was relatively empty and it wasn't a busy dinner time at all, I would have appreciated better and more professional service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=40,2.72,3.1,3.128,2.6000000000000005,2.9480000000000004

It was also not on the menu back then! My problem with this was that she didn't even bother to ask the cooks or anyone, it was an immediate no. At this point I was just irritated since this is the only thing I order every time. My boyfriend suggested we leave if I didn't want anything else but I didn't want to because he had already ordered his food. During the few times when she decide to check on us (which took a while after she told me about my item), she would only ask my boyfriend if everything was ok or if we needed anything.

43,Devin R.,"Manchester, NH",14,98,37.0,3.0,2016-02-13,"Hit up the lounge area with some co-workers this week. Shortly after sitting down, we were greeted promptly and offered some beverage suggestions. Given that BJ's brews their own stuff, we asked about IPA options and were advised that they had a seasonal brew on tap - the Committed IPA. After waffling about, the waitress offered to bring over a sample for the 4 of us. Great sample sizes, let me tell you! After giving this a taste, we were subsequently talked into trying the beer sampler option. A little tough to choose only 4 given the variety of beers here, but I made do with a Lager, the Pale Ale, the aforementioned Committed and a Stout. After giving them all a whirl, the Committed was probably the best of the bunch. Their lighter brews all kind of taste alike.  Dinner was a bit of a mess. It started ok with the Tomato/Mozz salad - good portion for a side and tasted excellent. Unfortunately, the main course - the Sirloin - was horrendous. I ordered it medium and it came out pretty rare, and the cut was awful - very sinewy. She took it back to give it some more heat, but we all know how that turns out. The hockey puck that returned was inedible. Without asking, the waitress kindly knocked it off the bill, but the damage was done. With one of these places that has a Cheesecake Factory-esque menu in which they try to provide something for every taste under the sun, it's impossible for the food to be great.

She followed up and found out that beignets were available. She brought us the birthday pizookie for the birthday in our party. Then, the rude woman who initially seated us brought the beignet out. We asked her for plates and she brought us 2 plates and 4 spoons. We were a party of 6 hoping to share our pizookie and beignet. Why did she bring 2 plates?

Our dinner salads were served 10 minutes before the table appetizers which was awkward for those who didn't have salads. No one ate until everyone had something in front of them. When our appetizers did arrive, we had to send one back for being overcooked. It came 15 minutes after our meal had been served. The entrees were okay, nothing special.

Waste of money and very run down in terms of food and utensils. Came in after a swim meet nearby because we were starving and the only place we knew nearby that showed up on our search engine and was open was BJs.  We came in and sit down, just a few people were eating since it was a few hours after noon in the middle of the day. Our server comes over and greets us and we give her our drink orders and since we already knew what we wanted to eat we gave that order to her as well. She doesn't write down any of our order and walks to another table to take their order right away once we were done. Later she comes back to give us our drinks and she forgets my drinks but I let it slide since I am normally fine with water anyway. She asks us this time what our order is again because she forgot on the way because she did not write it down. A little bit unprofessional.  We get our salads and notice that the forks are all beat up and bumpy. I don't complain but my mom tries to get another set since hers are worse than mine and gets another set of beat up utensils but they're better. My salad is alright but it is noticeable the lettuce is going old. My mother complains about her salad while she's eating it that she had some tomatoes that were old. We did not say anything to the server about this because we didn't want to have our food messed up because we got the restaurant angry with us complaining. When our food came out, I was given an extra side I did not ask for. I didn't say anything but in the end I was not charged. My fries were alright but my steak was well done. I know this is not a fancy expensive place to get steaks but the least they could do is not cook our steaks where they were well done and super dry from being so done. They were extra chewy and difficult to eat. I actually had to put ketchup on my steak to get rid of the bad taste it of drowning in seasoning. My mother on the other hand not only has the same issue but her mashed potatoes were extremely dry. She loves mashed potatoes but she couldn't even eat a few bites.

She took several mins to take THEIR order first and then put it into the computer system, which tells me not only did they get their drinks first but they were also about to get their food first as well.

He apologized, and served us from then on and definately made up for that girl's lack of work.  If i could rate the manager himself I'd give him 5 stars.  I hope that girl is fired by now and if anyone experiences anything similar notify the manager immediately and he will take care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=100,2.92,2.8,3.024,2.732,2.848

Didn't bother me that the food was dropped, it happens, what bothered me is that they didn't try to make my visit better.

110,Sarina L.,"Riverside, CA",468,177,234.0,3.0,2016-12-12,"This review is for this location specifically. I love BJ's wide menu choice and it usually comes out pretty good. Their service is not too great though. I've been to this location multiple times to dine in and to have take out as well. From my dine in experiences, the waiter/waitresses are usually really nice and happy to help out. They are also really busy helping multiple tables so sometimes it is hard to flag them down. The food always takes forever to come out. I don't mind that too much as my friends and I usually have good conversations while we're waiting and I also know that they're taking their time to make it if it takes that long. In a few instances, we've had mistakes in the orders where they forget to mention to the cook about a change or overall did not enter an order into the system.  In my take out instance, it took a while before someone can help us with our order. When they did, they apologized for the wait time and took our order. The food took even longer to come out. I would say I was there for almost 1.5 hours waiting for my food, to go. I might as well dined in at that point. Though the staff was apologetic of the wait, I think there might need ot be a better system implemented to prevent this long wait time, especially for to-go orders. Food: Their pizzas are always a good thing to order, deep dish or flat bread. I had their avocado eggrolls, perfect if you're an avocado enthusiast like I am. Pizookies are always amazing, if you're feeling full but want to squeeze in a pizookie, you can order a mini (even though that option is not on the menu, just ask!) I'll still be coming in to eat here as I like their huge options and of course the pizookies. If you do come here, just make sure you're not on a time crunch because the wait will take awhile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley,2.76,2.81,3.024,2.8920000000000003,2.79

About 20 minutes for a glass of water. Our food arrived and we never saw the server again. Later another server comes by and tells us the original server went him and she will be tending to us. After that we never saw her again until I waved her down for the bill. After being very unsatisfied with out service we just paid and left. Usually I would complain but it just wasn't worth it this time around. I did not leave a tip for the server because like I said, the service was horrible. A couple days later I check my statements and it seems the server helped themselves to a tip that I did not authorize. I was at a loss for words.

I sat at the bar and I must say the bar is so dirty. The bartender has bottles out and paree out and not fridge-rated. It's so dirty and she sat in the corner playing with a straw while my water was empty. She came up to me and asked me if I was doing okay and my water was clearly empty. The bartender sat in the corner (LEANING) after filling my water, giving orders to employees. She than told an employee named Jose to clean the 2 tables and he just walked away but she did say it with a huge attitude. Every 5 minutes she will do something than drink her hidden Starbucks in the corner. She leaves fridges open for long period of time as well. For the remainder of my stay she talked to every employee gossiping about each employee. Very unprofessional and when you're trying to have a relaxing dinner, it differ. The only good thing about this stay was the easy to find parking because someone had just pulled out. Hopefully corporate sees this post and talks to her.

I enjoy going to bars in downtown San Diego, Newport, and (if I'm feeling like dealing with traffic) downtown LA. This BJ's is less than 10 minutes from my house and I get way better service and cleanliness here than some ritzy bars I've been to out far away from me. The servers are great at what they do for as busy as they get. Don't get me wrong, no one is perfect but this restaurant and bar are one of the best and professional in the Inland Empire in my opinion.  The bartenders make delicious cocktails, so that should be reason enough to come here. Honestly I don't know how the bartenders keep up with the bar area AND making servers drinks for their tables, all while still being able to converse with people at the bartop and be attentive to them. Melissa(as well as all the bartenders) is an amazing bartender and person in general. Proof? I know people who are regulars at this bar and they don't even live within 30 minutes of here. One guy comes as far as Carlsbad just to get a few pints and watch Sunday/Monday night football. Never a wrong decision coming here.

She then tried to play it off saying ""im not sure i will find out, but i can go ahead and take your order for now"". Her name was Tiffany btw. She was clearly our waitress and was definitely ignoring us. A family of 5 came in about 7 minutes after us and they got their drinks and food before us. She was taking care of everyone else except us. We finally got our appetizers after about an hour, Hot wings to be exact, and we didnt even get plates on the side.

2,Phil Z.,"Winchester, CA",0,6,,1.0,2017-04-11,"If I could not give stars, I would.  This was one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a restaurant.  Let me preface this with the fact that I am normally very patient and understanding because my husband and I previously owned a restaurant.  We understand that things happen. First, we tried to make a reservation, but were told only groups of 35+ could have reservations.  Second, we tried to ""check in"" with the app.  The app would not let us do so.  We went to the restaurant hoping that it would not be that long of a wait.  I was told that we would have to wait 1 hour.  I explained that I tried to ""check in"" with the app, but the app was not working.  I was told that did not matter.  After I walked away, my husband overheard the hostess manager tell her that was the wrong reaction.  We only waited about 10 minutes.  This was about the only positive part of our night. I ordered the Berry Burst Cider.  A few minutes later the waitress returned to inform me that they were out.  I could order Angry Orchard.  I reviewed the menu and decided on a Strong Bow.  She said they were out of everything but Angry Orchard and Fromboise.  Neither of these appealed to me so I stuck with water. Our appetizer came timely.  But, our meal did not arrive for another 30ish minutes.  Also, it came in spurts.  First, my daughter received her mac and cheese.  It was only warm.  A few minutes later, I received my ""margherita pizza"".  It was only warm.  It was not hot.  I could touch the pan!  After a few more minutes, my mother in law received her parmesean crusted chicken after it was shoved in the armpit of the server.  At this point, everyone but my other daughter had received their meal.  They were all luke warm.  We flagged someone down to get the spaghetti.  It finally arrived.  IT WAS COLD.  Ridiculous!  My mother in law's broccoli was ice cold. My pizza was not a ""Chicago"" style pizza.  I know what ""Chicago"" style is.  My family is from Chicago, and the restaurant that we owned served ""Chicago"" style pizza.  The edge of the pizza that would be against the wall of the pan was non-existant.  It did not have a crust basically.  The middle part of the pizza was limp when help up.  It should have some crustiness to it and be able to stand so to speak.  When I heated up my leftover pizza a few days later, the crust in the middle was just right.  This means that the pizza was not cooked correctly.  Either it was not cooked long enough or the pizza oven is not hot enough.  Everyone else did not have an issue until the pizookie nightmare....... My husband and father in law had birthdays.  We got them the birthday pizookie.  They arrived at the table about 20 min after which is what I expect from my prior experience.  At that time, we ordered both daughters their own child pizookie.  After 30-45 minutes of nothing arriving to the table, we flagged someone down.  It was being worked on or so we were told.  Another 10 min go by, repeat flag down it's being worked on.... Complain to Mark the manager.  He will see what is going on.  Another 10-15 min later NOTHING.  Then, the kitchen manager gets pointed to us by Mark after Mark ran away from my father in law trying to flag him down a second time.  He apologizes.  We complain about everything especially the fact that the 5 and 10 year olds are waiting MOST PATIENTLY for their pizookie.  One arrives while we are talking to him.  The ice cream is MELTED.  So how long did it have to sit for someone to bring it to us for it to be MELTED?!?!?!?!?!?!!?  He says he will comp our meal.  We ask for the other pizookie (for the 5 year old).  It arrives.  NO ICE CREAM!!  Uh, it has no ice cream... Kitchen manager, ""I didn't know if you wanted the ice cream.""  Yes, it is for a child.  At that point, he discloses that they ran out of the flavor that she wanted., and he had to give her one size up.  WHY ON EARTH HAS NO ONE TALKED TO US ABOUT ANY OF THIS?!?!?!?!?!??!?!  So the 5 year old now has her pizookie that is HOT.  It was the only part of our dinner that was hot. So we get the bill....... the drink that I never got which was sold out was on the bill.  The meal was not comp'ed.  My mother in law complained to Mark again about how bad this whole thing was.  She had to demand that he do something about it and suggested gift certificates for us to return.  We got the gift certificates, but we are still not sure about returning.  Mark talked to us and apologized and told us he wanted to make it right.  He is not the right person for that position.  You need a strong leader.  You need someone who will take charge.  You need someone who will TRAIN your people.  Also, the front of the house should be taking responsibility for the mistakes and making them right.  He should not be hiding and sending the kitchen manager to talk to the customers. I left off the part about how the waiters and waitresses kept walking behind our chairs and running into us to get to the table behind us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60,3.04,2.89,3.028,2.212,2.95

I also like my pizza cooked. ****This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse doesn't like what I like.***** My reasoning is based on actual experience on a Sunday night after 10pm.  I sat at the end of the bar near the kitchen, where the employees congregate and talk shit about other employees and customers. I overheard conversations. Meanwhile I sat waiting for service for a good 10 minutes or more. I gave it a few more moments before I walk out. Soon someone is behind the bar. A couple minutes later she arrives at this end of the bar and greets me, hands me a menu, and then was about to walk away. ""I'm ready to order"" I speak up before she can. ""Small pizza and an IPA, please."" A few minutes later my beer is served and eighteen minutes later my pizza is served.  Hum? I'll give them the benefit of doubt and I take a bite from a slice. Doughy. The cheese isn't fully melted. Pizza isn't hot. When the bartender came back around I asked if possible to have a cooked pizza with all the cheese melted? She took the pizza and handed it to someone else while repeating my exact words for them to tell the kitchen. Ten minutes later the same pizza is returned with the cheese barely all melted but more than before. My first thought was this sucks. I equated the taste and texture to be as close as possible to eating a used soggy dish sponge topped with canned tomato sauce and pre-shredded mozzarella cheese then microwaved for 18 seconds, then plated and served with a beer.

8,Chris R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,33,,1.0,2017-07-02,"I've been coming here since grand opening. The food is alright, and the service is okay. But that's not what I'm going to be talking about. Instead, id like to bring up one event in particular.  I wanted to rent a keg for a party. I called the restaurant and ordered it. They told me I could pick it up the day before my party.  I go to pick it up and they tell me that there's a small problem. They have the keg, but they don't have a tap for it. The manager tells me that they can hold it there for me while I go rent a tap from a liquor store. I thought this was a good idea, so I went out and did that.  I showed up the next day (day of my party) to pick up the keg. Larger problem. The manager brings out the keg and it is not what I thought. The attachment for the tap needs something called a bass tap. I had never heard of this before, apparently it is kind of rare to find kegs with this. The manager offered no solution other than to go out and rent the proper tap. If I couldn't find it, I would be refunded. It might just be me, but I would expect a company that owns and rents out these kegs to have the proper equipment to use them.  I caved and went out in search of this tap. It wasn't easy, but I found one and rented it. Even the people renting it to me (a specialty beer shop) were so shocked that they called BJ's and asked why they would even rent something this rare.  We finally got the keg to the party (late). And all was well. That is until the next day when I tried to return it. I brought it in, collected my deposit and started walking out. Another manager yelled at me saying that she cannot accept a ""full"" keg. The keg was at a party. It was less than halfway full. It's usually pretty common to return one that's not empty. This wasn't my problem with what she said, my problem was with the fact that they offered absolutely no way to even use this thing and then expected it to be completely empty. And on top of all that, they took back my $100 deposit.  Long story short, don't rent a keg from here. The managers are completely inexperienced when it comes to this sort of thing and will offer no solution when a problem comes up. If this is the kind of attitude management has for small things like this, then it's no wonder why they received a B from the health department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60,2.68,2.82,2.928,2.8520000000000003,2.7640000000000002

109,Karl H.,"Wilmington, CA",23,7,,1.0,2017-10-13,"Well. I am not a fan.  Was craving prime rib. Bj's had a prime rib special going. They advertise in the menu a 15oz cut cooked to perfection. This is not true. It was more like a 12 oz cut and it was not seasoned whatsoever. The salad came first and not 2 bites into the salad my prime rib came. I said it was too fast and they offered to take the roast and keep it under the warmer. Which would have cooked it more and dried it out so i said no. The prime rib was cold and was kind of choppy the way it was cut. It was not a desirable cut of meat.   The server was a female. Her name was michelle and she was ok. But was over swamped with a table of 8 and mine and another table of two so i kinda got lost in the shuffle.  I was done eating and got my dessert included in the price, and it was good but too hard to eat.  It was the piezookie cookie, I didn't like the way they served it. Got cold too fast and the cookie stuck to the metal dish and was very hard to eat.  After dessert i waited about 15 minutes before i got my bill and then another 15 to get it back with my credit card.  Overall the meal was not worth the $27.00 they charge for it not to be cooked right and the right weight/size.

102,Sydney M.,"Riverside, CA",64,3,,1.0,2017-10-26,"Update: I received a message from someone at BJ's Restaurants. She gave me her direct e-mail and phone number. The e-mail bounced back, and the number was constantly busy or just rang. Still not going back to this location.  I went out for dinner with a friend, it was a Saturday night and very busy, so I expected the service was going to be affected. However, after a series of events that could have been avoided, I've decided to never return to this location.  1. Server spilled an entire tray of beer on me (3-4 ice cold bottles of beer). 2. When she realized what she had done, she ran away to go on break and never returned. 3. It took 10 minutes to get the attention of anyone.  4. A bus boy brought over more cloth napkins (that honestly do nothing to soak up any amount of liquid) and literally stood there staring at me, doing nothing until I told him I needed the puddle in my seat mopped up.  5. The manager never told us who he was, he just stood at our table making awkward conversation, reassuring me that the server was going to be okay, it's just embarrassing to spill orders, while I was standing there dripping. 6. It took over an hour to see our waitress again because, ""I saw you talking to my manager and I thought you were upset with the service, so I didn't want to come back to your table.""  All in all, a very poor dining experience. I've eaten at this location before and had some troubles with servers taking a long time to take orders, or basically just dropping orders and then disappearing until its time for the check.

36,Zanae Z.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-14,"Its so much that happened I do not know where to begin. First I scheduled a party for my two girls by going in and meeting with one of the managers Mark. We discussed having guest up to 25-30 people and I was interested in the buffet pizza & two types of pastas with meat. I was quoted $14.95 per person. Myself, my husband, and our girls sat down with Mark and discussed the menu and also the pazookies  as a desert for our guest. We were happy when we left Mark stated he would email us the contract. Needless to say I never got the contact so I call and got another Manager which was a female she ended up sending asking for my email address to send the contract so that we can finalize are agreement. I checked a couple of days later no contract I called back spoke with Mark he said he would email it over again. l checked and received the email; however, the contract was not correct. I then went back into the venue the next day and spoke with Camrielle and we went over all the details in person and finalized the contract.  The night of the venue was on 12/9/17 the manager on duty was the female manager I spoke with to finalize the contract. Once the pastas came out I noticed that neither had meat. I brought that to the managers attention & her reply was well that will be an extra $2 per person. I informed her that I was never advised of that and I do not feel I should be charged for something that I was not aware. Again I came down twice and responded through email to make sure everything was correct. She replied ok i'll take care of it. The manager came out with chicken and meatballs on a plate and put them inside of the warmers with the pastas ""NOT OK!"" Shortly after one of my guest was eating the pasta and found a long curly blonde piece of hair. She went to the manager asking if she could replace the pasta because there was a piece of hair inside & the manager reply was that she do not have employees with blonde hair ""NOT OK!!"" After my guest informed her it dose not matter we do not want pasta with hair in it. After this issue I asked about the individual dessert and she stated that they do no offer the singles anymore and that I would have to get one big platter for my guest to share which was not a part of the contract again ""NOT OK!!!"" The overall service was not professional and the service this night was terrible from this manager  my server did his best to accommodate my large party he did have assistance, but when we ordered adult beverages it took 20 mins at a time and when my guest went over to the bar to order they were told by the manager that they could not take their drinks from the bar. This took too much time away from my children party & I am very upset to say the least, but I did not say anything then because I did not want to ruin my girls party!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=20,3.52,3.09,2.932,,3.262

101,Samantha V.,"Fontana, CA",2,23,60.0,3.0,2018-01-06,"Long story short:  We paid $60 to wait a long time to eat good food at a claustrophobic table in an establishment with enough drama to be a high school.  All of the food we ordered was really good (which is the only reason I gave 3 stars) The tomato & mozzarella salad was refreshing, the wings were nice and crispy (could've used a bit more sauce), and we both very much enjoyed the dishes we ordered.  Short story long:  My experience here was mediocre at best. The food was really good, but the atmosphere & flow of the restaurant really ruined the experience for me.  We were a party of 2 and seated in a mini booth. Our drink orders were taken promptly, Diet coke & water, and we also ordered the buffalo wings appetizer. Our drinks took quite a while to get to us. Once we got our beverages we asked for more time to look over the large menu. About 10 minutes later we ordered the rest of our food: a stater salad, spaghetti & meatballs & lemon thyme chicken. Our server informed us that the wings app should be right out.... about 15 minutes later A different server brings us the wings & starter salad & literally walking right behind her was another server with our 2 meals. I have no idea where our original waitress was?  So picture this, a couple at a mini/half booth with a drink each, a long rectangular plate with wings, celery & ranch, 2 small plates to eat the app on, a salad plate & our 2 meals! We had to play Tetris to attempt to fit everything on our Table! So my boyfriend decides to try to scarf his salad down to make us some room. We then put the salad plate under the plate of wings so we could have some room. All of a sudden our original waitress comes and goes to grab the stacked plates, which makes sense if the plates were stacked & empty, but we still had 4 wings left and 6 celery sticks. The only reason these plates are stacked is so we don't have to eat our actual meals on our laps! So I tell her ""  We're still working on the wings, we just didn't have room for everything"". So instead of taking the empty plate under it and the small plates with bones of the wings we had eaten, she sets the stack back down and leaves.    So now we're eating our meals & we overhear a different waitress exclaim to a busboy "" I'm going to the back, I don't want to see him!"" And she walks away. Now the busboy is swearing "" F this & F that"" and he's getting all riled up. At this point I ask for some boxes and the check and we leave in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley,3.56,3.09,2.952,,3.278
