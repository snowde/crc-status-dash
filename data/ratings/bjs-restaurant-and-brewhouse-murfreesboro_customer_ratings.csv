43,Sarah T.,"Charleston, IL",2,48,30.0,4.0,2015-07-29,This place just opened where my parents live. It took them a minute to get to our table. They have lots of choices I mean lots!! I started with the a black cherry soda that is made there. It was pretty good.  We had the southwest egg rolls for starters. They were fried crispy and came with 2 dipping souces.  I had the deep dish raviolis it was tasty and a very large portion.  They have a reward card that you can get and the more you eat there the more you save which is nice if you eat there a bunch.  They were a little slow but that could have been because they just opened and we're getting into.the swing of things,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=100,3.504,3.504,3.504,3.504,3.5040000000000004

I did think it was very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet ambience this is not it.   Go early I you want to be seated in a reasonable amount of time.

107,Diana S.,"Nashville, TN",17,161,699.0,5.0,2015-08-08,For it being a new open restaurant. We got seated within 10mins for 2 people. They had alot of drinks options. Menu was decent they had a lot of options to choose from.  I thought their drinks was a bit pricy. Paid $10 for my mojito that wasnt strong enough. Server got our food order in and out fast.

I'm glad we got there when we did, because it filled up fast! We tried the avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. Both were great, but the egg rolls were definitely the favorite! Everyone at the table ordered something different, and everything was delicious. The service was average, everyone was nice, but you could tell the servers were a little overwhelmed with the rush. The food took a while to get to our table, and our drinks were empty a couple of times, but overall it was a great experience! I know they've just recently opened, so some of these things are to be expected.  We will definitely be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=140,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
68,Heather P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,146,182.0,2.0,2015-08-15,"They dropped the ball during lunch time. It was busy, however the wait time upon arrival wasn't too bad, about fifteen minutes. You give your phone number to the hostess and receive a text message when your table is available. (Hopefully your information is kept private but who knows.) Anyway, the hostess ended up yelling out our party's name and the text wasn't received until afterwards. We were led to a dirty table so the employee told us we'd have to go back and wait. Our waiting seats were gone so we stood awkwardly by the hostess stand for another ten minutes.  What I assume a manager (not in server uniform but black business attire) came over to seat us and led us to...the same dirty table. While we all stood staring at the infamous dirty table for a minute, I asked if we could just go ahead and sit down and wait on someone to come gather the glasses and wipe the table off. The ""manager"" said sure, left for about five minutes, and returned holding a wet rag and drink napkins and menus. ""I'm not sure exactly how to do this"" was said as the table was wiped off a little bit at a time and then dried with the drink napkins. Okaayy. After the glassware was picked up we finally received menus. And a menu it was. Granted about half was beer selection but whew it was like a small book. I ended up ordering the mahi-mahi fish tacos and since I couldn't decide between blackened and grilled, the server suggested one of each. We ordered an appetizer, calamari, which arrived about twenty minutes after initially ordering. The calamari was about eighty-five percent intact tentacles instead of rings. *shivers* By this point our drink glasses were empty. I'd say a solid twenty minutes passed with no server so we grabbed another server in our thirsty desperation. After another fifteen minute wait, our food arrives. Lukewarm food. My tacos are - tada! - fried. I was so dang hungry, I ate part of it anyway. It was so so. My friend's shrimp scampi was the same, so so. The garlic bread that came with it was as hard as a brick. I got a good laugh seeing my friend try to bite down on it. If you were wondering, our server didn't magically reappear until we had already starting eating. Go figure. Kind of crazy it took almost two hours from start to finish for lunch. I think this would be a cool place to grab a local craft beer with a pal but for food, me thinks not. Higher prices = higher expectations. As the Yelp two stars says: Meh. I've experienced better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=120,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

123,Mike R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",39,1,,2.0,2015-08-16,"I have been to BJs 3 times now and it has gotten progressively worse. I was there opening night, on 7/27, and everything ran like clockwork.  The food was delicious and everything came out very quickly, even the deep dish pizza which was very good.  We went there about a week later and things were much slower, but the food was still very good.   We just sent went this weekend for a third time and it was terrible.  We used the BJ mobile app to call ahead and when we got there we were seated rather quickly.  After we were seated, it took us a long time just for someone to take our drink order, which was 2 waters and an adult beverage.  It was not the same person that ended up being our waitress so I think they were in the middle of a shift change.  We got our waters and then waited...and waited...and waited.  We finally had our waitress come to the table to take our order. Still no adult beverage...which was one of their signature drinks.  Eventually, the mixed drink came.  Then we waited, waited and waited.  Our waitress came back to check on us and my wife ordered a beer.  We waited some more and finally our food arrived.  My wife's food was perfect, the Parmesan crusted chicken, but the beer she ordered 10 minutes earlier was still not there.  My burger however, burnt to a crisp.  I tried to eat it but could not.  I sent it back and waited.  My wife eventually finished her meal.  Still no beer.  Still no burger for me.  We waited and waited some more.  I finally had to cancel my order and her beer and we left.  If the management can get the bar and kitchen in order, I would recommend this place.  If not, I would avoid for a few more months.  That might be a good idea anyway as they still do not have all of their beers available (their porter and stout) yet either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=180,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

103,Laura H.,"Christiana, TN",112,211,42.0,4.0,2015-08-31,"With brick walls, exposed ducts and garage-style windows as room dividers, BJs appears to be in an old industrial building, although it is brand new. My eyes were immediately drawn to the bar - a backlit wall of colorful bottles offset by three large, clear tv screens. The effect was very visually appealing. Although we arrived just after 5:15 pm on a Friday, the dining area was pretty full, so we were seated in a booth in the bar area. That area was pretty empty but within about 15 minutes, it too, was full and there was a wait for tables the rest of the time we were there. We had a California Club flatbread as an appetizer. Put avocado on anything, and I'll order it! It contained a lot of fresh ingredients and was plenty big enough for three people to share. For my entree, I ordered Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos accompanied by ""bistro seasonal grains"". This dish is part of their lighter menu and while the portion size was large, the calorie count came to 640. BJs is not your average sports bar offering only fattening burgers and pizzas! Their menu is just shy of being as large as Cheesecake Factory's, and there are a plethora of options that should satisfy just about anyone. The tacos were very good and the pitas they were on tasted homemade. The seasonal grains consisted of brown rice, quinoa, cranberries, cucumber, corn and tomatoes with a little kick to them - likely from garlic. This was a perfect side dish for the tacos, and I left there feeling full but refreshed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=60,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

Wife and I each ordered a bowl of soup and shared a small 16$ pizza. We waited too long for our food and when it finally arrived it really wasn't hot. Soup was way too thick, like gravy. Tasted OK nothing special. On to the pizza. Best way to describe the pizza would be to say similar to pizza Hut, taste, quality, texture, etc. It was OK.  A little too pricey for just OK.  It never ceases to amaze me that investors can find a million++ dollars or so to build a beautiful restaurant but don't seem to have enough in the budget to properly train the staff before they open the restaurant.

The cost of the food and the one drink I had were not at all a good value. A single cider cost as much as a six pack of the same so I guess the atmosphere is supposed to make up for it.

The drinks took another 15 minutes or so to come and they looked like they had been sitting at the bar waiting for pick up. My glass was sticky from where it had overflowed presumably when it was made. They were not busy, maybe 2/3 full on a Tuesday evening. The food was fine but nothing memorable. Everything took a very long time to come out. The Avocado Egg rolls were pretty tasty and the mozzarella and tomato salad was good, so it seemed promising. I had a sirloin. It was a good cut and cooked to my liking but it wasn't seasoned at all, not even salt and pepper. The potatoes were very bland as well. My wife's chicken pita tacos tasted odd, we couldn't put our finger on it. Not terrible but def not good. Server took a long time to get our check and then never returned.

After being seated our waiter took our order and the table next to us arrived a few minutes later.     While we waited on our food the folks at the next table ordered, received their drinks, had appetizers, and began their dinner. All while we waited...and waited...and waited.  We didn't have anything special, just a chicken salad and a hamburger with fries. Funny thing happened while ordering, when I asked a question about an entree the waiter had to look at someone else's plate to see what the answer was...he had no idea.  During our time waiting he did tell us our food was on the way, I don't know what way it was on but it was another 15 min before it arrived.  He said later there were no runners to bring the food out, I would beg to differ as most people know food that is ready sits under the warmer and the plates get very hot...ours wasn't even warm. I pointed out the quick service at the next table and he was like a deer in headlights-he didn't even understand.  I felt certain we would be visited by the manager but he never came. When we finally received the check I quickly tried to pay and it was another 5 min before the our server returned to the table. After dropping off my receipt the guy physically ran away from our table. Our server was probably a very proficient person but it appears he was set up to fail. The kitchen was probably a disaster and he had to cope with its effects with little managerial support.

In a world where customer service is everything and I know this from being a server in college, everything can suck but if the server is friendly and outgoing, they can turn it all around.  It was so bad that the bill was $90 and it hurt my friend to tip him only $5 with a note that said, ""I wanted to leave a huge tip, because I am a restaurant owner, but your service was less than satisfactory.""  Maybe I caught this place on a bad night, but it was upsetting because you only turn 30 once.  The first impression is the lasting impression.  You only get one chance to make a positive first impression.  I will not be back to this establishment and that's a sad thing because the food was quite enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.568,3.2400000000000007

Go to Old Chicago and get a tasty pizza. Or go into your fridge at home and make your own sandwich because any of these three options is going to be far better than what BJ's has to offer. First off the food is just terrible, and I know it's super cool because it's a microbrewery and they make their own sodas and its brand new in this city but just because the turd is polished doesn't not make it a turd. I went here at lunch and I ordered their deep dish pizza for one it tasted like I was eating straight flower with no pizza sauce on it. After one slice I asked the waitress to bring me a menu so I can in hopes of redeeming this lunch time. But to no avail. I ordered their turkey and pesto sandwich thinking how can you screw up a simple chicken and pesto sandwich? Well leave it to BJ's to figure out how to do so. Now as a fat guy I love food I even love terrible food at times if I'm hungry but I will never be that hungry enough to go back to BJ's! So save your money and go literally anywhere else. Now if you are just going to drink some beers with your buddies then cool it serves its purpose as a microbrewery but it should be left is just that. I'm sorry if this comes off harsh but when you spend 25 $30 on a terrible lunch that in no way was redeemed and even after the server asked you was everything to your liking and you say not really and they do nothing about it then this is what you get an honest review from a guy who pretty much eat anything even if it's terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=160,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.404,3.2000000000000006

Third time I've been here and this will be the last: First time was an ok experience. The chicken pita tacos were fantastic. What killed it was the bartender/ manager who wouldn't let me sample a beer prior to purchasing it. I travel all around this country and NEVER have been turned down for a sample of craft beer. He did however offer me a porter in which he poured half way by accident. To be frank, that's why they got 2 stars.  Second time was better until the food came. The bartender was down to earth and let us know not to order things we mentioned. I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. To start it was over cooked, and they even asked how I wanted it prepared. Secondly, the meat was a patty which I'm sure was previously frozen. Didn't even taste the brisket due to the copious amounts of delicious BBQ sauce, (in which was the best part).  As my side, I elected roasted brussel sprouts. And I got precisely what I ordered. They were crunchy, burnt and dry.  Third and final experience I ordered the boneless buffalo wings. The picture depicted chunks of chicken, not wanna be mc nuggets which I wish they were. These were the last of the bag, got all the frozen breading, some burnt French fries, and some other item I can't explain. The sauce was so overpowering, I couldn't tell if I was eating chicken or lutefisk.   I never return food in a restaurant, I just don't go back....

 It most definitely wasn't a fluke.  We arrived around 11:20 a.m., so they weren't busy, but we still waited a few minutes to be seated at one of the many empty tables.  Our server was friendly and took our drink order and was patient when we needed several minutes to look at the menu ( I will say that is a plus about this restaurant ....many, many selections to peruse).  Since we knew pizza was a big NO for my son, we both chose steak (mine included a scampi like shrimp).  I again inquired as to the exact verbage for a light pink center and was again told medium for light pink, medium rare for a warm pink.  Should be easy enough as my son and I ordered our steaks cooked the same way.  They both arrived with a very dark, rare center but we thought we'd soldier on and try it anyway.  INCREDIBLY chewy.  The first bite took about 5 minutes to chew enough to swallow.  Perhaps it was because it was so undercooked.  The server said it was indeed too pink and advised next time we ask for medium well.  Um....SHE recommended how we order it.  I ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes for the side.  The mashed potatoes were M.I.A but she advised I could take the asparagus off and eat it while waiting for the new steak.  She, however, took my sons entire plate, to include his fries, so he was left with nothing to eat.  I must say, the asparagus was very flavorful and made me really look forward to my newly prepared steak....until I received it.  My son's came back and was still too rare, and his fries were cold.  My steak came back incredibly over cooked and tasted like all the flavor had been cooked out of it.  The mashed potatoes were also cold, which I assumed could be surface cooling from the walk to the table, but when I separated them in the middle, they were cold throughout.  The scampi also had tomatoes in the picture, and since my son expressed interest in trying my shrimp, I asked if the tomatoes could be omitted.  I was advised they could, so imagine my surprise when there were no tomatoes on top, but we found 5 under the shrimp.  It was almost like they'd noticed in the kitchen they weren't removed, so they took off the top ones and flipped the shrimp, but there were still tomatoes under the breading and cheese.  No manager ever came to the table to discuss our meal with us, despite us seeing at least one, possibly 2 people that looked like they might be managers.  Imagine our surprise when the bill arrived and it was nearly $27.  They'd removed my meal, but charged me for my son's meal and our drinks.  I paid it, along with a tip for the server (I figured she didn't cook it, so why punish her), but had to go to the bar to get a to go box for my sons steak as the server never came back after dropping off the bill.  He didn't intend to eat it, but since we'd been charged for it we brought it home to daddy.  We figured he'd never know if it was overcooked or undercooked since he'd just throw ketchup on it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro?start=160,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6000000000000005,3.2000000000000006

He comes back with sweet tea. Now I'm a little annoyed, but still easily corrected.. I order a Caesar salad- but with no meat. I still meant that to be my entree, but ended up with a side salad.. By this point I'm not even bothering with letting the waiter know because I feel it's pointless. They bring out wings with sauce on them when my boyfriend ordered them without, but the waiter noticed and also brought some out without also.. Finally, we order the cookie trio, the whole reason for coming that night.. I ask my boyfriend what he thinks the Chances are of us getting the right flavors, given the service so far..

135,David L.,"Shawnee, KS",55,405,407.0,3.0,2017-09-23,"Nice space, decent food, service.....meh. Not sure what was going on this particular night, but I think some retraining is due with some of the staff. Before I get into that, I like the looks of the place. Laid out well, clean, and just somewhere I could see myself hanging out. The food was good. It didn't make me have a zen moment, but good is good. I'd have it again, although the hot chicken ( a TN staple) was just okay. I'm not sure what the hype is with that sandwich, but I'm happy to continue the search to find out. That brings me to the service. Our sever didn't act new, so maybe it was more than just her. Starting off with the drinks. We were a party of four. Three of us ordered a libation, and one an iced tea (lame, but I love ya man). His came out first of course, then came the others, except mine. Say what?! The other two got a specialty house drink and a black & tan. I ordered a draft beer. When I inquired about my beer, the server said that the bartender was swamped. Okay, I can see the bar, I can see the bartender, what's your definition of swamped? I didn't say that to the server though. That was for Yelp affect lol I mean, I got a draft. Glass, spout, pull the dang handle. But, you can make two specialty drinks? Is it possible you didn't order it? Even with all that, it was some time before I got my appetizer (beer). The food came out slow as well, and not at the same time. I'm rooting for you BJ :/ You've got a nice space and some good food. I just think some tightening up the basics is in order.

Should've left after this but i was starving. The booth they sat us in the light was out used my flashlight on my camera to read the menu. Waitress saw me didnt offer to move us. We literally moved ourselves to another booth with lighting. The cuscus mac & cheese DISGUSTING feels like your eating caviar. Ordered the california sandiwch it was okay.

For desert we ordered a pizookie. I think that's the name of. I know that thing has hella calories but it was absolutely delicious.  Overall, we had a great experience.

I actually really enjoy having dinner at the bar here. There are plenty of TVs to catch the game and a massive beer selection.  The bartenders here are attentive and pour delicious drinks. I think it's a good place for me to catch up on emails, have a cocktail and eat some good ahi tuna poke. The ahi poke appetizer is my go to dinner here. For a chain, the tuna is pretty fresh and well prepared. The wontons give a nice crispy texture to the tuna and the flavors are well-balanced. Sometimes I will have a side of fries (a guilty pleasure of mine).  There's usually a wait for a table if are coming as a couple or group.

Bj's what are you doing a month ago this location reminded me of the Bj's of Old and that goes back to the locations in Laguna Beach and Maui where you first started years ago. ""I lived in Orange County Ca for 17 years"" Came in for the first time last month and the Pizza tasted like it did years ago, then the wheels must have fallen off the pizza oven belt the last 2 visits. I came in for your Monday special on 10-16-17 we ordered a large 5 gourmet  meats the first pizza looked ok but was lacking toppings but to top that pizza off it was COLD. Then you brought out anther pizza guess what Cold again. Then I though I would give you another try today 10-20-17 we ordered another large 5 gourmet meats and guess what this time no Toppings your pizza was not cut all the way, we asked for extra sauce which their was no sauce to be found.   You have now lost a long time customer from the beginning because of lack of quality control.

I have been here before and enjoyed the food and the service but this time was different. Maybe it is because we sat up at the bar area?  I had the beet salad,  which can be very delicious but it was definitely more beet than salad and way too many beets.  I didnt care for it at all.  I had the brussel sprouts which were delicious. Our friends tried the tumeric cauliflower, and no one liked it. I also had the chicken wraps and said they were very salty.   I have been here before and have had the Ahi appetizer and I should have stuck with that.  Worst thing about our experience was all the dishes on our table -they need to bus tables better.  They didn't bus our table until we were ready to leave so we had plates stacked up and glasses everywhere and beer glasses of beer that we drank. On a good note, I'm a fan of their beer and they have lots of great choices.  My husband enjoyed his 1/2 rack of ribs and they have great fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-murfreesboro,3.16,3.13,3.13,,3.142

It's the only thing I've ordered here and the first two times it was great, but this time they over did it with the cayenne pepper. I should have ordered a beer but I was driving. My wife was okay with her shrimp and pasta, but not enough to order it again. We were seated just behind the hostess station and someone had dropped a napkin in the aisle and at least 12 servers walked around it or stepped over it before it was picked up, the same thing happened with a food item.

I met friends there last night and was disappointed to see that the entree I ordered previously was no longer on the menu.  My husband and I both orders steaks. Both were pink in the middle which is fine because that is how we ordered them, the problem is that they were both dry as a bone. I've never seen a steak that was pink in the middle that had absolute zero juice flowing from it. My guess is that they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time along with our sides. One of our friends ordered a house salad along with their meal and I kid you not they brought him a plate of chopped lettuce. No toppings!

I noticed the book-like menu and commented that there was no way a restaurant could specialize in anything with such an expansive menu. My expectations were low as I ordered the Chicken Thyme dish and substituted the rice for a baked potato. Our meals came to our table in about 15 minutes(insert my smirk), And at least from the appearance, mine looked delicious. And guess what? It was! Two chicken breasts in a perfectly seasoned broth and topped with roasted brussel sprouts paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio.....heavenly! My husband's pork chop was thick, juicy, and tender. Everyone was happy!!! Our waitress Miranda was knowledgeable and helpful as we made our selections, and we wanted for nothing our entire visit.
