103,Anna G.,"Georgetown, TX",25,90,5.0,2.0,2012-06-11,"I was SOOOOOOOO excited to finally get a BJ's around here. I usually frequent this place back at my old University stomping grounds at OSU when I return to hang out. I love their beer, I think it's pretty darn tasty. The Hefeweizen is my go to beer but the stouts are delicious as. The food selection is ""Cheesecake factory-esk"" If you can't find anything on this 8 page menu then you need to work harder. We came on a Wednesday because we didn't want to have to deal with a wait...there was a 20min wait. Ok ok so you just opened fine. I'm good and still excited when we get seated...until that 5min mark has passed and we still haven't seen our server. And when she does show up it takes another 5min to get our drinks. Ok ok so your new, I get it. But then the food came, and it was tasteless. It's just not how I remember it. My excitement has ceased since then. I haven't gone out of my way to come back but wil when I'm looking to have a good beer before the movie starts at the theater behind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2?start=100,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

Went about 10 minutes without a server checking in us a couple of different times, and we all needed drinks. 10 minutes to get check after we had to ask for it.

Unfortunately their kitchen was pretty backed up (which I understand - since it was a soft opening), but goodness the food was DELICIOUS. My table of classmates shared the Turkey Club Sandwich, Italian Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Alfredo Baked Potato and the Miso Salmon. Everything came out hot and tasty - we all loved everything! We ended our meal with BJ's Famous Pizookie - a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. What a sweet way to end our meal! Yesterday the service was much more prompt that my last visit and the server was very kind and recommended some different dishes to me and my group. I had the Fresh Watermelon and Feta Salad - so refreshing and perfectly dressed, and the Chicken Club Sandwich - YUMMO. The sandwich had toasted, buttered sourdough bread, delicious grilled chicken, bacon, fresh avocado, tomato, lettuce and garlic mayo - all music to my ears. I also got to taste the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza - all good flavors, however the pizza was kind of soggy in the middle :(. Yesterday our bill was $46, which included the Chicken Club Sandwich, the Fresh Watermelon and Feta Salad (which is considered a ""small plate"" and is around $3), an individual Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza and the Grilled Steak Salad.

Full of chicken, avocado and tons of other good yummy things. Everyone at our table raved about their food from salads to salmon to burgers.

Burned cheese pizza for our daughter. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which had very very small amounts of meat, a rip off for the 13 dollar price tag. And here's a tip for ALL servers---don't put hot food, plates, drinks,  or anything else for that matter, in front of a baby sitting in a high chair! A billion years of evolution, all the technology and knowledge we have, the smartest human beings have ever been, and your stupid ass puts a steaming hot plate, and drinks (twice) directly in front of a baby, who instantly reaches at them.

37,Daryll B.,"San Antonio, TX",455,480,2811.0,3.0,2014-06-13,"First time here. Before entering the building, one is greeted with a beautiful moat or pond with cascading fountains as big as the full length of the restaurant. It was night, so I couldn't take pics of this waterscape. We were seated right away and attended to by Pierre, a polite and great server. The menu was average sized and reminded me of TGIF, with similar pricing. The prices were a bit more than Chilis. Sandwiches at Chilis are in the 8.95 range, and here in the 10-11.95 range. We ordered the potato skins with ranch dipping sauce $8.95). They were extra crispy, fluffy, and topped with excellent bacon.  My wife got the angel hair pasta and shrimp. Her shrimp were undercooked, but the manager took care of rectifying to our satisfaction and explaining all their cooking processes. What a way to go up and beyond to satisfy a customer! I had the roast beef dip sandwich, which comes with a dark and rich au jus and horseradish. Outstanding, that roast beef was so tender--and with that jus--I haven't tasted a sandwich like that in ages. Unlike some places that serve processed gristly beef on their Philly sandwiches, this was real beef.  The sandwich was on a toasted french roll and came with with thin fries or seasoned wedge fries. I chose the wedge and dipped them in that jus. They also have steaks, 1/2 pound burgers, pizza, ribs, and a huge craft beer collection. I mean this is a brewhouse.

I ordered the Honey Lime Seared Scallops thinking the description sounded heavenly.  ""Tender seared scallops topped with tomato, basil, fire‑roasted red bell peppers and honey lime vinaigrette. Served with oven roasted asparagus and garlic seasoned brown rice."" What I got was nothing even remotely like this. The brown rice was completely flavorless, it was just so bland, I had to ask for butter to give it *any* kind of flavor. The asparagus were overcooked to the point of being dried and the level of pepper they put on it was so beyond overwhelming.   The scallops had a nice texture but there was no taste of honey or lime, just incredibly spicy.

Russ was an absolute gem as well, and took good care of us after Cipriano went home. Our servers, Emily and Liz, were perfect, and everyone in our party was impressed with the efficient and friendly service they provided.

71,Robert M.,"Austin, TX",13,555,13.0,3.0,2014-11-11,"Came here after work with a buddy. We worked late and he was in town so he suggested the place. Arrived to a packed parking lot but the place wasn't that full. Some sort of corrupted feng shui going on there. There were plenty of booths so the hostess decided to save the normal booths for someone else and sat us at these weird 1/2 booths. The ones that are uncomfortably small like they are trying to pack more people into the joint so that they can make more money off of you. Wait...maybe that explains the parking mis match. Just about as soon as we sat down, the waiter arrived and asked us what we would like to drink. I had about 15 microseconds to know that I'd like to spend some serious time looking thru the massive drink selection. He seemed surprised that we didn't have it rolling off of our tongues so that he could run to his next income source. I asked him to give us a few minutes and he readily complied. My friend comes a lot and recommended that I try the four beer sampler. There were a lot of good choices and I figured he'd drag me back again so I just ordered the first four pale beers. Rather than one pint, you get four glasses of four ounces each. Seemed the way to go. Then things got a bit weird. I'm a ""fully confident"" guy who doesn't mind ordering ""girly drinks"" if the yen hits me. In fact my go to cocktail is a cosmo which my friends give me endless grief about. So, when the four glasses came, I didn't think much about drinking four beers out of four cutesy glasses that looked like champagne flutes. That is until I tried to get my normal sized nose around the glass. Can I guy just get a drink?? It was very awkward trying to drink from the micro-sized, flute shaped beer cups. I don't think anyone did a test of them before they stocked the store with them. Great idea of a way to sample beers, terrible way to deliver the beer. I had the first four on the menu, but one of the four didn't do it for me. I'm not as good of a beer snob as my friends so I won't try to amaze or impress or influence you with my tastes. Leave it to the fact that you should sample thru them, just bring your own glasses. I had the California club. It was about OK. It was the normal fare with some sort of overly dry bread. Or baked out. It came with great avocado, chicken breasts, slim amounts of bacon and the rest of the normal fare. I rate the beer as better than the food. Perhaps it was my choice. I'm definitely coming back to try some other options and hopefully then I'll just stick to one beer at a time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8600000000000003,3.1200000000000006

I got the shrimp tacos which were good, just thought they could use a little more seasoning, marinade or char grill the shrimp versus broil them. My sister got the Mediterranean chicken tacos, she loved them. Then her boyfriend got the jambalaya and enjoyed that too. We finished up with pazookies, and these are a must!

How is she still an employee? She's standoff ish, takes FOREVER and is a complete mood killer. One time I ordered a steak and it came out completely wrong and she was nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later we asked another server to go find her. We were literally one of two tables in the restaurant so we know she wasn't busy. What is this girls problem???

She crashed and burned tremendously.  We left before our food could even be sent to the kitchen because we are done with her.  We will ask before being seated next time for anyone besides Calaya.

24,Julie H.,"Wimberley, TX",24,15,,1.0,2017-03-01,"If i were to rate nearly every experience here including just the day before it would almost always be a 5. But this is about my last experience when i was trying ti celebrate my birthday with my mom and sadly it's not a five.  We came in excited to spend time together and enjoy the good food but it took forever just to get our drink order taken, and then forever to get refills from our server.  We couldn't get her attention when we needed something because she was standing and chatting with another table for 5 to 10 min at a time.  It is extremely frustrating to eat at a place you enjoy where you know the staff is capable of delivering not only good food but also good service and be totally ignored. At one point when we were looking for some help from the our waitress and she was once again chatting up the other table one of our party approached the front desk where they seat you because 3 waiters were standing at this one table where our waitress had gone and we couldn't get anyone to even get our waitresses attention for us. When I say 5 to 10 min each time I'm not kidding we ate in less than 30 min but it took over and hour and 45 to get through lunch by the way. After we get a waitress from the front to help us since our waitress was occupied, apparently they told her we were feeling neglected and she came and was overly friendly trying to compensate for ignoring us completely and while we already irritated by the bad service we would have chalked up the bad experience to her having an off day and come back again no bad review here and called it a day. But apparently she took what we said at the podium to that table she couldn't tear herself away from because the guests from that table felt the need to walk by our table and make rude comment and try to embarrass us. Not sure why, unless they were friends or family to each other but even then you wouldn't expect one guest to not only hold up the waitstaff from every other guest but to also go out of their way to try and ruin another guests experience when they didn't appreciate the hold up.  The manager was doing his best to apologize for his waitresses poor service and even tried to talk to the guest that went out of her way to be rude but after all of it happened and we paid for our meal we just felt a bit bullied and ganged up on so it just didn't feel like enough to say sorry and offer no real recourse.  And all of this happened when my mom was trying to treat me to lunch on my birthday with my 4 little kids. My oldest son is 6 and was crying in the car when we left because of the stress from the woman who felt the need to come and give us a smart remark.  We were trying to have a nice birthday celebration lunch and by the end of it the day was just ruined. So we won't be back not that they will notice or care but if you want a nice lunch yes they food will taste good but maybe bring water from home and hope nothing is wrong with your order or go down the road and eat at one of New Braunfels other reastaurants that consistently offer good food AND good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

3,Yadhira L.,"San Antonio, TX",439,174,517.0,2.0,2017-04-24,"BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants. It was a restaurant of choice with my BFF when I lived in California. The food never disappoints and I usually have a great time. However, this location must be cursed. It's been a pit stop for me between San Antonio and Austin for a few years now. However, I have not had the best experiences here.  First of all, it feels cavernous. The high ceilings and long center aisle of leathery booths feels like a trek and I'm usually guided all the way down near the rest rooms. Not sure if it's me or their policy to fill seats starting from the back but that's where I wind up. Being so close to the restrooms you would think that it's a quick trip to the loo and back to table. When it takes a lot of hand waiving and a few ""excuse mes"" to get the waitress' attention, it takes the bus boy all of 30 seconds to clear my table when I head to the facilities. I was with my kid and we decided to go together. We had packed up our leftovers and left the box on the table. I didn't think that was enough so I also left my keys hoping that was enough to let them know we were coming back. Not 5 minutes later and everything was gone. My leftovers were tossed in the trash and my keys sent to the back office! Not even at the front desk. Why would they think that someone wouldn't return immediately for their keys?? I was so upset. They offered to make us another plate but I had no time to wait. Iwas mid-road trip and I was already waiting for someone to fetch my keys way in the back of the cavernous long aisle, around the corner, and in their top secret vault. It's just so illogical. Why not wait a few more minutes to make sure we weren't returning. It wasn't crowded. There wasn't a wait. The manager offered me a coupon for a free pizooke but there's no BJs close to my house and I don't plan on stopping by again. It's a shame because I really like BJs and their menu selection. On another occasion, I stopped by with a friend during happy hour. We were headed to Gruene and decided to meet along the freeway at BJs. Once we were seated we could not order anything for happy hour. The waitress said we had to sit at the bar to get any happy hour deals. So, we had to move over two rows, to another booth, to another waitress, just to get the lower price. I just don't understand why one booth costs more than another when they're both the same. It was embarrassing. Made to feel like we were cheap for moving tables with our water, menus and napkin wrapped utensils in hand. I just think it's lame. Again, the place wasn't packed. Who cares where we sit for happy hour?  This location must be cursed or the management likes to keep things hollow and vacant including my table. Happy hour rules do not make for a happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

Prices have gone up, portions seem smaller and not quite as good, management is getting weaker all the time, in house maintenance is lacking, and their rewards program went to crap.

16,Emily I.,"San Antonio, TX",2,3,1.0,1.0,2017-07-31,"Came in for a quick bite in between my shifts, sat at the empty bar around 1:30. The bartenders were nice but mainly stayed in the corner texting and chatting the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly well but I wouldn't have two people on at that point. It's not just a waste of employee hours but you end up having them distract each other rather than give service that is above an beyond. My problem with my visit is because of the manager. The 4 options on the tv were old replays of basketball, a jet ski race, and an interview with Dennis Rodman. I asked the bartender if they would be able to put on Shark week on one of the boxes (my restaurant has been playing it all week and it is a big hit) she was equally excited to put it on and skipped off to ask the manager. Disappointment struck like a Great White clamping down on a surfer when she told me her manager would not allow it because they are a ""family friendly"" restaurant. I laughed at first not realizing she wasn't joking.. I somewhat get that it might not be family friendly if they are showing sharks attacking. But that's not what shark week is, its education programming about sharks and how they are not the man eaters we perceive. But what was most laughable is that the manager would consider sharks not family friendly but Dennis Rodman is! I get it, Bjs has strict  rules, I worked at one for a year many moons ago. But this managers skill need to be checked, the bar was empty, the restaurant was fairly empty, there were workers standing around everywhere just chatting and waiting to go home, and the simplest customer request gets denied. I won't be returning to this location because I live no where near it and was only in the area to help my boss. My comment will probably never be noticed but maybe you Saturday morning manager will see this and learn how to run your floor a bit better. Also I'm just bored waiting for an appointment right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.76,3.26,3.26,,3.46
2,Khian R.,"Universal City, TX",92,91,235.0,4.0,2017-08-18,This is one of my favorite spots . Yes I have plenty . But I like to come to this location for the great customer service and dessert. I come here sometimes just for a Pizookie. Tonight I tried the steak for the first time. I'm usually eating pizza. It was cooked just the way I ordered it. Our server Nicolas was really nice and attentive . My family enjoyed their meals as well. My go to drink is the white peach margarita. A must try. The sriracha wings were amazing. Spicy !!! But the flavor was so good we ordered more to go. Some of them didn't make it to the car . That's how food they are. Download the app and you can place yourself on the waitlist . Soon as we walked in our table was ready.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.72,3.28,3.28,,3.4560000000000004
7,Eryn P.,"Waldorf, MD",48,33,55.0,3.0,2017-08-20,"Mediocre food and atmosphere. The menu was so long (20 pages) that it took me forever to order. When the food came I would call mediocre at best. I was a little disappointed. With so many choices, I was sure that they would have something fabulous. The fried artichoke was actually pretty good (if you are lactose intolerant ask for no parmesan on top).  The piadini (not sure I spelt that right) was alright too. And the children's meals were pretty typically, with the mac n cheese being straight out of a box.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.64,3.27,3.27,,3.418
10,Amber D.,"Kyle, TX",0,23,,4.0,2017-09-06,"This restaurant is usually good. I got a tuna salad and my husband got a chicken sandwich. Both were really good and our drinks came out good! I would of like a little faster service considering they weren't busy at all, but I understand some people aren't meant for the service industry. We will be back to BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.6,3.3,3.3,,3.4200000000000004

0,Katie H.,"San Antonio, TX",127,310,737.0,5.0,2017-11-22,"The service is 99% fast and excellent. The food is very good (minus the burgers), and they are always updating the menus. I love happy hours and the weekday specials on food and drinks. This place always keeps me coming back- especially the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos- an ""enlightened"" entree (low calorie) and yet super filling and flavorful! Being a rewards holder definitely has its perks too! I get to skip waits and receive discounts/free pizookies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.56,3.33,3.33,,3.422
5,Regg P.,"San Marcos, TX",0,19,40.0,4.0,2017-12-15,Decided to try again after our visit which was not the best. Recommend the Italian Market tavern style pizza which was pretty good. Also tried their Strawberry Splash drink has a good combination of daquirri and Pina colada. Don't forget to try the Chocolate chip Pizookie. Our server Jared provided good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.56,3.36,3.36,,3.4400000000000004
1,Carla M.,"Downtown, San Antonio, TX",18,2,,4.0,2018-01-12,"Lunched with two friends on Friday, January 2, 2018. Sat in a booth in the bar. Ordered the quacamole burger, chicken Alfredo, and grilled chicken salad. All the entrees were well prepared and truly delicious. Was expecting the chicken Alfredo to be mediocre as it usually is in restaurants not specializing in Italian cuisine. It was WONDERFUL!  The quacamole burger had a large serving of quacamole which was also surprising. The salad was huge and tasted as good as it looked. We'll be back!  Note: I didn't give a 5 star rating because the wait was pretty long for the entrees. Fortunately, we weren't in a hurry!  It was worth the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-new-braunfels-2,3.68,3.39,3.39,,3.5060000000000002
