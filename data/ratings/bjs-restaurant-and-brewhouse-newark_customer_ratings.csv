691,Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",429,304,146.0,2.0,2012-01-02,Server was 10 min late on our water. Food was also taking longer than expected. I already experienced shitty quality at BJ's but I went here since it was close to the mall. I have to say their buffalo chicken wontons were good but 3 wontons is kinda little. Their seared ahi tuna was good but didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was out of a can or the freezer.  My main meal was the unlimited soup and salad. Their house salad was drenched with too balsamic vinaigrette(sp?) and their chicken tortilla soup was really good. My friend's flatbread pizza was bland and I had to use ranch dip to add some flavor into it.  Their meals are EH but I usually ONLY go here for their pizookie. That's the only thing they're good at.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=700,2.92,3.02,3.228,3.0480000000000005,2.9800000000000004

The santa fe rolls are another one of my favorite.  The best beginning is what we usually order N it has the above rolls with it, it also comes with mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip with chip. The drinks are usually on the VERY sweet side, so if you're not Into super sweet cocktails make sure you ask them to reduce the syrup.  They have a large variety of beer. And a few selection of wines. They have a pretty large menu and haven't had everything on it, but so far the things I have are very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=760,2.92,3.01,3.232,3.408,2.9739999999999998

It had slices of tomatoes with fresh mozzarella balls and Parmesan in balsamic vinaigrette. Super tasty.  I ordered a small pizza half great white shark, and bjs combo for my nephew. It was ok I expected deep dish pizzas to be loaded with more marinara, cheese, and toppings though ha. Just from what I've seen on TV, but it was just alright.  I had some of my moms salmon it was good. And mashes potatoes? Hella good!  My sister ordered a steak medium rare and it looked like black dookey, burnt, overcooked and chewy. So maybe avoid the steaks or get em medium rare.  Awesome to bring kids for the kids menu. It's like 5 bucks n my nephew got a pretty big plate of spaghetti, side of mashed potatoes, and a drink.

Going inside in Bj's Restaurant, holy crap it get really full at night, and you really have to go there a little early if not you're either outside freezing your butt off, or stand all night till you're call up (if longer than 30 minute forget about it) unless you're with your family of course. For appetizer I ordered flatbread pizza...both are california club, and grilled chicken pesto. Love the pizza!

1147,Helen T.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,7,,1.0,2012-01-23,"I know there's a lot of lovers of the pizookie famed BJ's brewery, but i just had THE WORST experience ever!!! My mom, husband, and I wanted to watch the 49ers game this past Sunday, along with 3 other people. So there were 6 of us. I called to make a reservation for the bar, since we were a big party, I thought it'd be fine. The girl on the phone said she had a booth in the bar, 3rd row back reserved for us at 2:15. Cool. But we get there and the guy at the front says, ""Sorry, we don't do reservations. And the bar is open seating anyway."" I have worked in a fine-dining atmosphere for years, and I realize that this is just casual but all dining protocol says that this in itself warrants one free dessert. Furthermore, management didn't stand behind their employees, but rather blamed us, the diners, for not knowing that they don't make reservations. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW?!? Then they screwed up my food order, forgot to put three of the six chairs and silverware sets at the table (so half of us were left standing for 10 minutes until we went and got our own chairs), and then forgot to put in our pizookie order but didn't realize it for HALF AN HOUR! The manager finally brought one out for us, didn't appologize, just ""there it is"". The only saving grace was the waitress that relieved our original, forgetful one. Rose, I think her name was. She was very polite up until we signed the check, then she didn't care who we were after when we asked for to-go boxes. Overall a terrible experience by front of house and management alike. Food tasted good (great job BOH) and was hot when it eventually came out. But I am still NEVER going back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1080,3.2,3.2,3.268,2.8840000000000003,3.2000000000000006
995,Jen V.,"San Pedro, CA",100,53,18.0,3.0,2012-01-23,I've been here twice and have enjoyed it every time. The food is great - especially the appetizers and pizza.

667,Steve H.,"Newark, CA",68,70,45.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"Most BJ's are pleasant. However, this one in particular lacks finesse. Put a little bit of effort in it please. You know that was coming, pause. Although there's a gang of people stopping by for a quickie during lunch, the wait is minimal since there's a lot of hands on the job ready to service you. My cousin and I shared the Avocado Eggrolls, Grilled Chicken Club with a cup of Clam Chowder, and a Pina Colada. Avocado Eggrolls - Crispy tubes stuffed deep with avocado. The sweet, sticky sauce on the side plays nicely with the eggrolls.   Grilled Chicken Club - Moist, succulent chicken breast topped with crispy bacon and smothered in a creamy garlic mayo. Arousing to the tastebuds. The shoestring fries that go with this dish were titillating. Clam Chowder - Slurping goodness but overly salty. Pina Colada - If you want to black out and not remember how you ended up in a stranger's bed then drink a few of these. Tasted nothing but liquor.  Don't expect a wild, mind blowing experience. This place is known to have it's up and downs. Stick with the beers and pizookie and you'll come out on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=660,3.28,3.18,3.272,3.2120000000000006,3.2200000000000006

478,Viet N.,"Alameda, CA",349,464,226.0,3.0,2012-01-29,"It's a shame I was driving and that it was brunch time, or else I would have had a beer at this place. Maybe even a pizookie.  Because what I had didn't exactly blow my mind. I had the great beginnings (I think?) appetizer (basically mozzarella sticks, avocado wraps, some eggroll looking thing, and chips with spinch dip), and the California scrambled eggs.  Everything was loaded with cheese, and I couldn't even finish my entree. Yes, half of the appetizer and 1/3 of the entree was enough to fill me up (I was sharing with the other person in my party of 2).  It was good overall , and the sauces went very well with their respective appetizers. But throughout my meal, I kept thinking that this tastes exactly like something I would get at Fridays or Chilis. It was a little cheaper, but the food is not something I would go for on a regular basis, much like the other chain restaurants I mentioned.  However, the server, Christy, was very attentive throughout our time we were there, so plus points to BJ's!

875,Tiffany C.,"Fremont, CA",80,4,,4.0,2012-01-29,"I think by now I should be considered a regular here! Ever since I came back from college to the East Bay, I have gone to BJ's a ton just because there are very few places that are open late night on the weekends.  Venue is pretty big compared to the other BJ's I've been to. Place seems like a full house Thurs-Sat nights. If you come around 10/11PM there may be a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2-4 people. Some people may consider the food to be a bit on the expensive side but I think the prices are pretty fair for the portions you get. The food is average in my opinion and I usually order the California Chicken Sandwich with Crispy Thin Fries. BJ's also has a small bites menu. Small bites meaning good for 1.5 persons.  There is a wide selection of beers but since I'm a beer hater...I can't elaborate on that part of the drink menu. Drinks are average prices (~$8-9) and are usually above average in strength. I usually get the enlightened drinks to try and make me feel better about consuming my high calorie sandwich/fries. The ""Skinny Rita"" is okay and is supposed to be the strongest of the enlightened drinks.( I suggest mixing it with a straw before drinking it.) I tried the ""Mojito Lite"" once and I hated it...I suggest sticking with the regular mojitos. Since I come here so much, I kind of wish they had happy hour. (Unless I'm totally clueless...which is entirely possible...so they may have happy hour??) Considering the food and drinks the place is average.

Timing was perfect, we arrived just after kickoff and grabbed a table in the bar. Katrina was our waitress and she was good. Ordered some nachos to start for the first half and had a medium classic combo pizza for the second half. Nachos were loaded and loaded!  Very tasty!  We didn't finish them, and that's not usually the case...LOTS of nachos!! The pizza?  Excellent! The beer?  Great!  Had several Sam Adams. Parking can get tight, especially with a local game on (49ers, Giants, Sharks, etc). There is some construction going on with the old part of the mall...my guess is they are going to redo it or maybe make more parking?  who knows...but it doesn't improve things for now.

In fact, the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the lack of competition BJ's has for late-night grub. The wait for your food is always a minimum of 30 minutes, no matter how busy the restaurant is. The food tastes fine, but is also quite overpriced for what you're getting, and you're really paying for the nice ambiance and the TVs.

I've been here quite a few times and it never fails. We are always greeted by friendly staff. The waiters/ress are always very attentive and on point. I love coming here for their savory fresh Ahi Poke. It's chopped sashimi Ahi marinated in poke sauce with diced avocado. The Ahi is served with crispy wonton chips- so delicious. I've also tried their chicken noodle soup and the minestrone. They're both nothing special, but do their job as fillers. Their pear ciders are also quite delicious. If you love ciders, try the pear cider! Not the biggest fan of the berry pear cider because it's too sweet! The Margherita Fresca (has mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil and parmesan cheese) and California Club (bacon, chicken, tomato & garlic aioli) flat bread pizzas are amazing! They are both crispy, fresh and flavorsome. I would recommend sharing appetizers and plates with your table to try different plates. Their BJ's Cobb Salad is also fresh and delicious! If you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday evening (or during a game), plan on waiting at the very minimum 1 hour. They are always packed- which in my opinion, is a great sign. They have a full bar and flat screen TV's all over. The place is loud with dim lights, but I love it! Plenty of parking too.

As such, I was not surprised when I was told to arrive at 8 pm. We arrived at 8 and gave the name, mentioned we had call-ahead seating (there were two of us). The hostess handed us a pager and told us that'd be 30 minutes. I told her I did not expect a wait with call-ahead seating. She assured me that the call-ahead list was so long that the wait would still be 30 minutes. I told her that was unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager. As soon as the ""M"" word escaped my lips, the pager buzzed and we were ushered to our seats. Thankfully, we once again had wonderful service. Our server, Shane laughed and joked with us. At one point, my friend joked about getting brownie points for her birthday - and Shane ordered a birthday brownie as a surprise. He was on top of things and made the experience truly enjoyable. We spoke to the same manager, Brenda, who recognized us and thanked us again for the feedback. She told us how glad she was that we'd come back by, assured us that the front end waiting system is something they're still working on improving.

There is ALWAYS at least one order messed up at our table, which is amazing since they don't even involve any substitutions - which means they just don't know how to prepare the stuff on their menu?? And the waiter/waitress has never cared - ""oh you didn't order this? are you sure?"" SERIOUSLY? We've had our entrees come out before the salads - we actually had to remind the waiter TWICE about our missing salads - first when he brought the entrees, and again while we were ordering dessert - didn't see him at all between that, we ended up walking up to the bar to replenish our drinks. I've been brought pizookies with cold cookies and half melted ice cream multiple times, and one night our check came with charges for things we didn't even order! Last night, we ordered drinks that the waiter had to come back and confirm THREE times - what the heck were you writing down?? I don't know why I have continued to give this place so many chances.

678,Lisa D.,"Newark, CA",0,31,2.0,1.0,2012-07-14,"When a friend suggests we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery it makes me CRINGE. BJ's tries to trick you into believing that they're better than other local sports bars, grungy lounges, or late night restaurants. This is absolutely ludicrous thinking & a complete scam. Save your time, save your money, & stay away! I've had better service at Applebee's! BJ's has provided the most consistently horrible service I have ever experienced at a ""restaurant"". When BJ's first opened it never really appealed to me, but I went with my friend & some of the cast after a show. We arrived around 11:30 pm & were ignored for more than 5 minutes. Once acknowledged, we were told to ""hold on"" so they could check to see if they had seating. Finally, we get lead to a table in the far left corner which would've been great had my friend not been in a wheelchair.  After flagging down someone to see if another table was available, we were rudely left maneuvering around chatting associates blocking the ramp & interrupting at least 3 other parties to clear enough space for her to get by. The only idea we received from BJ's staff was, ""Well, do you think she could get down the stairs?"". Although the décor may be nice, the setup is abhorrent. Even a fully able-bodied person struggles to maneuver in BJ's. The night proceeded the way I've now come to expect of BJ's- drinks forgotten or mixed up; food forgotten; dirty cups, plates, utensils, table; pathetic excuse of a waitress who takes orders & never comes back (another associate told us our waitress had left). When I went to order food at 12:30, I was shocked to be told the grill was off for the night already!  I ordered a turkey sandwich & it was THE WORST sandwich I had ever had. For $10 I would expect deli-like quality, but this sandwich made even Subway look delicious. My sandwich consisted of two slices of toasted wheat bread slathered in mayo, a huge chunk of tomato, & about a half of a pound of pre-packaged sliced turkey. I wish I had waited until I got home, I could've made a better sandwich there. A couple months ago, my boyfriend & I went to BJ's for drinks around 11:45 pm on a Friday. Luckily, we came together & he was there to walk me through the dark seedy parking lot. We sat at the bar area & were talking when the waitress came over. We asked for a few minutes only to be bombarded for an order 2 more times in less than 5 minutes, with our impatient waitress snidely stating that, ""the bar is going to close soon"". Umm, excuse me? Aren't you open for another hour?? We ordered a round of drinks around 12 & called a friend to join us. He arrived about 12:15 & we ordered 6 more drinks in total & an entrée. Halfway through, our waitress appears & states she hadn't expected more people to come in after 11:30, so she had made plans & was taking off; at least she left us with a replacement. At 12:50 a manager approached us & told that, ""it's time for you young folks to get out, we're closed"". I was so taken back by this distasteful & disrespectful treatment. We were paying customers in the establishment during business hours & not being loud or rowdy. If it was 1:05 perhaps, I could understand a gentle reminder that they need to clean up or something. Utter rudeness, from a manager no less, definite mood killer. Last night my boyfriend & I were looking for late night grubbing. We could've gotten elsewhere, but for some unknown reason I thought going to BJ's would be a good idea. It was 12:15 pm, so I called in to inquire what time they planned to turn off the grill. I SPOKE WITH ASSOCIATE CHRIS who put the phone down to CHECK WITH A MANAGER & told me as long as I am in the establishment & have me order in by 1, they will honor it. All I can say is BULL SHIT! My boyfriend arrived at 12:45 pm prepared to be seated & order for us both as I would be a few minutes behind him. THEY REFUSED TO SEAT HIM! I arrived shortly after 12:50 pm to find myself locked out with a smug looking manager leaning on the door. I was LIVID!!! Why say you're open until 1 am, but then do everything you can to deny customers?! If you close at 1 am, that implies that your associates leave at 1:15 at the earliest not at 1 like your patrons should be!  My boyfriend had placed a to-go order (minus the alcohol of course) & after calling him from the locked door & screaming at the manager through the glass, my boyfriend convinced him to let me in. I was sooo angry & making a bit of a scene, yet not once did any associate approach me to try to remedy the situation or understand my side. I had done my part & still got screwed by BJ's management again! I would never recommend BJ's to anyone! After everything, the food wasn't even that good. I could get the same caliber food at Red Robin at a lower cost, & maybe even TGI Fridays or Applebee's. I hope management reads this, because they ought to be ashamed of how they treat patrons in their establishment. Heed my warning- save your time & money- STAY AWAY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=660,2.8,3.31,3.28,2.34,3.106

My group came here for a little surprise dinner for our friend's birthday & engagement. I had called the day before and made reservations with a manager. To my surprise, when we got to the restaurant they did not have my reservation. I was visibly upset and a little frantic as I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to pull off the surprise, but the hostesses didn't give me any information on when a table would be ready for me... they just gave me the little light up thing and told me it would light up when the table was ready. My friends and I went to the bar and sat there for 20 minutes and our table was still not ready. I went back to the hostess stand and explained the situation that this is a surprise party and the guest of honor will be arriving in 8 minutes. I asked for the manager, and they told me that they already talked to the manager and he said I didn't have a reservation. Their whole attitude was very nonchalant. It was obvious that they did not care about our situation that we were in because of their incompetence. Eventually we did get a table in the nick of time (thankfully the guest of honor was running late). Once we were sat we didn't see our waitress, Courtney, for a while. We were sitting their with empty glasses for a good 20 minutes before we could even find her to get another. I can say that she was probably one of the worst servers that we have ever had. She was absent the whole time, rarely checked up on us, NEVER refilled our waters, and was completely rude whenever she was at the table. The only time she was quick to get to the table was when she came to get our money and the gratuity that she absolutely did not deserve.  The management at this restaurant is terrible. Brenda, the manger i spoke with when i made my reservation is obviously incompetent. There is another woman manager (blond) who was on duty when i was there was either completely aloof of the situation, or lacked the managerial skills to do anything about it. There was a male manager on as well, he was better than the other two... but could definitely use some customer service training.  All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.

RESERVATIONS---My immediate family is big, which is why we usually opt for call ahead seating. My sister called when they opened letting them know that we would be there. We all arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation and they let us know that they had us on the list, but took us off because the girl who took it down did everything wrong. Told us we would have to wait an additional hour 15 minutes for seating (It was Father's day and the last game of the basketball series). Pretty :( , but went with it anyways. My sister decided to stay with the pager, while the rest of us headed out to Lion Super Market to shop around to kill time...Come on 1 hour 15 minutes ridiculous!!!! (According to the other reviews, this isn't a new issue) DROPPED PIZZA; Blagh STEAK:Since the game was over, things slowed down a bit. We were able to put in our order and ordered two of their steaks, a steak salad and an XL wheat crust pizza have buffalo chicken and cheeseburger. The order came, the steaks were over cooked, my mom's steak salad had only about 3 pieces of steak and a scant handful of mixed greens. The ended up giving us a small pizza and a medium pizza since they ran out of the XL wheat crust...except they dropped the medium pizza on the floor. They offered to replace it. My sisters and I ended up sharing the small pizza (4 of us). By the time the replacement pizza came in, we were already done with our meal.  REPLACEMENT PIZZA: So they end up making us a replacement pizza; that shit was burnt and they still expected us to eat it, The bottom was charred and honestly we didn't want to eat it and were already full with what we had. We told the waitress who notified the manager and he saw how burnt it was, he offered to replace it again. We could careless, so he offered to take it off our bill.  I understand that it was a busy day, but in general I was pretty much disappointed with the rushed service, missed orders, and the burnt pizza (come on, you drop our pizza and then replace it with a burnt one?!

And of course beer, beer, beer, and maybe just one more beer.  They have a lot of beers to choose from and some nice seasonal drafts.  But don't get too hooked on their seasonal creations, because you will miss it when it goes away :( We mostly sit in the bar area and the servers there are always on top of their game!  We've noticed that the service in the main dining area is not always as good.

But yes, normally people come to BJ's for the pizookies, so definitely order one to just try! So the reason why I give this BJ's 2 stars is because of a particular experience I had once about a year ago.  I came with my friends [5 girls], and being in high school, we don't have that much money!  Anyways at the end of our meal, we all split the bill and paid in a lot of fives and ones, but one of my friends paid in quarters!  Since it was a lot of quarters, we decided to make the waitress's job easier by putting them in piles of four, however, when our waitress saw the money, she was super pissed off, and demanded one of our parents [who wasn't even dining and only there to pick up my friend] to take all the quarters back and give her bills.  I thought this was super rude of the waitress, and I mean money is money, does it matter if it's coins or bills? In conclusion, I honestly feel like BJ's is only worth going to if you're craving pizookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=580,2.96,3.28,3.22,2.152,3.152

A few minutes later one of her coworkers comes over and she says something to him and they both stare, no smile. It honestly felt like a high school exchange.

Cool, as long as they were being transparent and honest. Still sucked having this mix up though. We finally got our food after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. I had become very impatient. Food was good, still prefer The Cheesecake Factory's cajun pasta over BJ's but still good. The waiter was cool though and she went out of her way to ""talk to her manager"" to get us a discount on our bill for the long wait. Awesome!

However, the dough they use is always amazing and flavorful. I tried the Irish Pear beer on a whim, and didn't regret it. It's extremely light and not too fruity.

The food is of that saucy, cheese-filled, bready fried variety. It's similar to what you find at Yardhouse. There are very few plates on the menu with fewer than 1200 calories, and if you drink beer, well, maybe you should fast for a few days afterward. Even their light menu, which is maybe 6 items, hovers at 600 calories each.

First of all, my meal was way better.  Once again, I ordered off the lunch menu and got a lunch portion-sized of the BJ's Cobb Salad for $9 along with a side of Tomato Bisque soup for only a $1 more.  The soup portion is quite large so it's quite the deal and there's plenty in there to share with someone else too.  In terms of taste, the soup was decently seasoned although I wish it was a bit more creamy.  The BJ's Cobb had turkey, bacon ,avocado, and bleu cheese dressing mixed with romaine lettuce.  It's a chopped salad so the lettuce as well as the other elements on the plate so don't expect leaves of romaine on the plate.

764,Big S.,"Concord, CA",174,33,94.0,1.0,2013-03-09,Recently I visited the restaurant in Newark and wished I had not gone.  The food is good and the beer is fantastic.  The problem is the service and the management.  It was not packed in anyway and you can see they had so many people on the payroll doing anything but servicing the few people that were paying customers.  It got so bad the security guard in the parking lot started ushering people to the tables while the hostesses were chatting away.  Any special request was meeting with rude looks and I was really wishing I had not been there.  It will be the last time I ever set foot in a BJ restaurant again.  I don't expect people to do anything but service the customer and I guess that is asking too much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=820,2.56,2.77,3.048,2.5000000000000004,2.686

384,Amy H.,"San Jose, CA",1246,1333,2170.0,4.0,2013-04-11,"BJs is a bunch of goodness in one restaurant, whether you want an entree or DESSERT. The place is pretty big and can get pretty packed around dinner time. Lunch would be a great time to go since it won't be as busy as the dinner crowd. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday like my friend did. She had the beer sampler. LUNCH Lunch is great here because they have awesome specials that are discounted. I got the club half flatbread pizza and side salad. The pizza was the perfect size that was cut up in smaller slices. There was chicken, avacado, cheese, tomatoes and onions and it was sooo good. The salad was a nice addition and it was all for $8 or $9. I couldn't believe it because dinners are always pretty expensive. Definitely worth coming here for lunch. DESSERT PAZOOKIEEEEEE. Sometimes I just want to go to BJs for the Pazookie. If you don't already know and you have been missing out, a pazookie is a huge baked cookie with ice cream on top. An individual size can be split with 2 people. You can also get the sampler with three different flavors, such as oreo cookie, regular cookie, and red velvet. I wouldn't recommend the other crazy flavors because the regular cookie is just plain delicious. If you really want to YOLO with friends, I would get the PARTY SIZE PAZOOKIE. You can literally split it with 5 others because there is so much cookie and ice cream. The cookie is thin, warm, and gooey and the ice cream scoops just belong with it. Eat it quickly though or else you will have melted ice cream on your delicious cookie :( **TIPS** 1) Lunch time is the way to go if you want cheaper food. 2) Celebrate any occasion here and they will definitely accommodate you.  3) If you come here for dinner, prepare for a 30-45 minute hour wait. 4) GET A PAZOOKIEEE. 5) Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300,2.84,2.75,3.072,2.7359999999999998,2.7859999999999996

So, when the in-laws popped in over the weekend and asked if there was anyplace we wanted to try for dinner, we decided it was time to try BJs out. Our party was seated quickly on a busy night and our server popped in for drinks right away. I wanted to get food ordered for the boy first thing and our server was happy to accomodate. I write that, because many servers out there develop severe brain freeze when I try to order food before the drinks. She saw the logic and made it happen. Wifey loved her sesame salad, In-laws liked their food, turkey burger and shrimp & lettuce wraps. I prolly was the least pleased of the bunch food-wise. I ordered a burger with bacon and cheddar, thinkin it would be a safe bet. Safe, sure. Great, not so much. The burger looked formidable at first glance, but was found out to be a thin pattied wimp. There was about 3 inches of lettuce and several tomatoes hiding about a half inch of burger and 2 anemic bacon slices beneath. It tasted fine, but I will pick something else from their extensive menu next time. There will be a next time.

319,Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782.0,3.0,2013-05-08,"I've been here 3 times already. The first time I came with my food buddy. She had told me that if we called ahead we could make a reservation. being that it was a Tuesday night I didn't think it would be busy. So we walked in and it was PACKED. We asked for a table for two. Our wait was going to be 25 minutes. In reality it turned out to be 35 minutes.  As we're waiting for our table I asked for a menu. The way I see it is that if you're going to be waiting 35 minutes minus well get a head start by looking at the menu, right? I do this at every restaurant :) Once we decided  on what we wanted we wrote it on a piece of paper. When we got our table and our server introduced herself. We handed her the paper where we wrote our order.  By doing so we sped up the process of getting our food.  As always we ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer. 1st time here I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich. The grilled chicken was so juicy and tender. In other words it was well made. Well stuffed with avocado with pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, chipotle mayo and roster chili peppers. I forgot what kind of bread it came with lol   2nd time  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. It had green onions, tomatoes, black beans, jicama, corn and bbq dressing, mozzarella cheese and crispy onion strings. I didn't like this dish much. Mostly because it had more lettuce than anything else and it didn't have much chicken. I wasn't going to pay extra for extra chicken. 3rd time I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger. With 1/2 pound of angus beef, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, red onions, baja sauce, chipotle mayo and fried jalapeño peppers made this one SPICY burger.  I must of had the spicy batch of jalapeño peppers that day. I kept asking for water lol I don't have a favorite dish, yet. I'm satisfied just by ordering the avocado egg rolls as my main dish. It fills you up and every bite has avocado  and has the right amount of spiciness.  One thing that bothers me is why the appetizers take FOREVER. 15 to 20 minutes. I don't know if they're always short handed in the kitchen or if they make the appetizers from scratch. If they do then that explains why it takes time.

Their HH specials for drinks aren't that much of a discount, $1 off drinks for the most part. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've been here a bunch of times over the past few years and I never had a problem with their food. I recommend buffalo chicken pizza, cobb salad, and their wings. The 5 pepper wings (extra hot) isn't that spicy at all, so all you spicy lover freaks would be able to eat it with no sweat. The pizookie is what BJ's is known for. Delicious melted cookie with ice cream on top dessert... mmmm. Might come here for my birthday for the free pizookie.

It was that or the calamari but I also wanted to try the calamari so I got that instead. The ahi poke will be the reason I come back for a second visit. My sis in law kept talking about now delish their pizzas are so she ended up getting that to share with my boy. Before ordering my meal, we got munch on the calamari and I thought it was really good. Not too crunchy but not to soggy either. I decided to get a regular veggie burger. First bite... I was satisfied. Only pet peeve I have is when restaurants serve you burgers and all the insides (produce) are served on the side. Next time I think I'll mention for them to put together for me. The fries were great!! I love how they were thin. Very flavorful! IDecided to take a bite of the pizza crust from my sis in laws order and oh wow! Delicioso!!!! Last but not least... PAZOOKI time.

It's usually pretty lively, there's beer, and decent food. That's really all we want in a place to chill at on a Friday after a long week at work. The wait is usually at least 30 minutes (sometimes an hour), but it's not that bad because we usually go to the bar and have a few beers before we get seated. Sometimes we'll get lucky and we're able to sit at the bar or at the bar tables for a while before, too. Sometimes not - the bar can be really crowded. The beers BJ's has on tap are pretty good. And if you don't like their beers they always have outside beers on tap and beers in the bottle. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, too. There's something for everyone when it comes to drinks. Their food is hit or miss. The apps are pretty good. Salads are too. I usually get the pizza and that's always delicious. But some of their entrees are either really good or just so-so. I would stick to the burgers and sandwiches. Everything else, to me, has always been not that good. Every time I get something other than the pizza or a salad - like a baked potato, chicken, fish, etc. I have been let down. I usually regret ordering that and think I should have gotten the pizza like I usually do. Their service is so-so as well. Its hit or miss.

I got the chili and cheese giant stuffed potato. It was good; however, it tasted like it was boiled rather than baked. The size of the potato had gotten smaller from the last time I had ordered it.

This particular location is by far the largest of the BJ's I have been to. The restaurant to me gave off a classic 1920's look with a contemporary edge. We called ahead to avoid a rather large wait time and got seats right away!  To start the night off right, my party ordered the  ""choose 8"" beer option. This gives you the chance to try 8 different beers. Its probably about 3 beers in total (double shooters) and really helps you learn what types of beers you like. We ordered the artichoke dip which was pretty good, not spectacular, but the beer made it just right.  Our meals were cooked well and fast. I ordered a spicy pasta which only tingled. But the flavor was good in general.  Our server and host were both extremely friendly and made us feel like we were VIP's which made the evening really memorable.

The crust, admittedly, was quite tasty and in line with what I expected, but the toppings/final execution and taste was just - lame. Greasy cheese, flavorless tomatoes, dry tiny meatballs, no taste of garlic except in one bite even though ordered it with roasted garlic. It was the equivalent sadly of a microwaveable 2-minute frozen pizza in taste as far as the toppings go. Not in any way worth the cost.

It almost feels blasphemous eating at a chain in the bay area given the options we have here. We stumbled to this place after laughing mad at the made up theater and at that late hour, starving we were in no mood to search. So, we came here. (gee!! I sound so apologetic!!) For Drinks we ordered IPA(liked it), a Mohito, a Long Island(no one offered me a taste) and for the teetotaler a cream soda( tasted it and it was wonderful).  We ordered the Avocado rolls and Mushroom bites(Don't remember what it's called) and they were good. Only down side is the sauce that comes with Avocado rolls. It's too sweet and I don't think it goes well with the rolls. Instead I asked for Cholula  hot sauce,which I think is perfect match. We ordered a large Vegetarian Pizza for main course and finished it real fast. I am very prejudicial when it comes to Pizza. The only Pizza I like is NY style pizza with very few toppings. So, when everyone wanted to order Pizza... I said yes but was very cynical about it. But for once... they were right and I was wrong. The Pizza was amazing, not NY style but the crust was fluffy and the flavors were subtle. After devouring the Pizza we ordered a Pizokie trio with Red velvett, white chocolate Macadamia and cookies and cream. They were okay... but next time, I am going to order only the single flavor version. I think because of the tininess of the cookies, they were not soft and chewy anymore.

When we looked up BJ's on googlemaps, a coupon popped up for BJ's, $20 for 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Can't get better than that. Amazing deal if you ask me. My husband and I ended up going with 2 other friends and we both got a chance to use the deals, thanks to our waiter checking with his boss to make sure we could. As a group we shared a pitcher of heff and original wings to start off, and I thought the wings were delicious. I would definitely come back for those wings and the pizza.  The salad was limited to ceasar or house, which I was ok with. My husband ordered the chilli soup which I think he enjoyed, and we shared a medium spicy meatball pizza, and it was spicy alright. It was definitely the jalapeno type of spicy where it burns your mouth a bit. Delicious flavor however, and I like that the crust and presentation on the serving plates was like a deep dish pizza. This is a crust you can eat on it own. (medium pizza for 2 and we had left overs to take home) I haven't been here in a long time, but I do remember their scampi pasta being super delicious as well. I'll have to go back and verify that. The oh so famous pizookie... warm cookie topped with ice cream was delicious as usual, but a tad too sweet for my taste now. I think I'm getting old. But my friend ordered the red velvet (I didn't even know they had different flavors now!) and I ordered the cookies n' cream one. The cookies and cream was on a delicious (but overly sweet chocolate cookie which I normall love if it's not too sweet) topped with vanilla ice cream and cookies n' cream whip. The red velvet seemed less sweet, and tasted ok.  As for the seating, when you walk in, everything to the right where the bar was is free for all, first come first serve. We went there because we really wanted to watch our football games (both Stanford and Cal had games going on, half an hour apart) and thanks to Bj's big tv splitting 4 ways, my husband and I were quite content that we were able to watch our games while enjoying our meal (we called in advance to make sure they were going to play it before arriving).  The menu here is great with a wide selection of foods (and beer- their samplers are fun) you may enjoy, and I have to admit our server this Saturday by the bar section was terrific! Great service.

I prefer the Buffalo Chicken Pizza over that one. And the Balsamic Chicken was tasty. My gf finished her dish without a problem. The dip app was small. Not enough dip for the amount of chips that they give you and for $8. The other patrons were very friendly.

I really thought they forgot to add pizza sauce and cheese because it was that dry!  It was replaced by the same tasting pizza so I thought the cook was probably different that night.

Their thai shrimp lettuce wrap was also not as good as I remembered it.  Our server was very friendly and energetic but his breath was really bad.  Oh, they tried twice to serve us pizzas that wasn't ours.  The first attempt was a female server who at least asked if the pizzas she was holding was our order and clearly it was not because I didn't see greens which should have been the bell peppers so I told her it was not our order.  Five minutes later, a male came with the same looking pizza but this time this server did not ask if it was our order.

No matter what way we went (waiting for a table at the bar or main dining area) we were going to have to wait. Luckily, for us we found a party at the bar that was just leaving after our 10 minute arrival.  Our ordering was very simple. We just had to order what was necessary for  celebrating a congratulations/going away occasion: - Buffalo wings with buffalo sauce on the side - Artichoke dip - Blue Moon beers - Hennessy shots  The buffalo wings were crispy, yet tender. To control the heat of the buffalo sauce, we had it on the side because not everyone could handle the heat. The artichoke dip was nice and creamy. It was served warm and made our tortilla chips taste great. I didn't drink beer since I can't have any, but I did have my fair share of Hennessy shots.

The food was definitely worth it this time around. I just know now to only order pizza. The only issue is that I ordered a giant pizookie for my friends and myself to share.

I got the flat bread pizza and there where 4 small slices of pizza. It was pretty tasty though. The chicken lettuce wraps were a pretty decent size as well. One other thing to keep in mind is the happy hour specials ONLY APPLY TO THE BAR area. Not sure if this rule is for game days or everyday. But when we went they only offered the specials at the bar.

399,Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3314.0,4.0,2014-02-03,"My wife and I had lunch here on Saturday (for some reason, my wife didn't want to eat at a strip club). We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (you're given a black pager if you have to wait). I was nice enough to go outside (this freed up a sofa for a family to use). The flies that were trailing me soon followed. Our hostess was friendly (my wife just noticed that she was wearing too much eye shadow- maybe she was trying to look like a wolf). We were seated in the large room on the left (the only other time we were seated there was during the grand opening). I had to ask for place settings. The tables weren't fully set up yet. Our server was young and clearly new. He was also light (he could get blown away by a stiff breeze). Anyway, he was attentive, but annoying (I found him to be a major pest at first). We left him a nice tip ($9.81), but I have to say that it was because we didn't have any singles (our total was $50.19, and so a tip of $4.81 would have seemed a bit harsh). At one point, a manager came by to check on us. He was nice, and was in the area a lot (a group of about 10 suddenly arrived- they were pretty loud). As usual, I enjoyed the songs playing inside (ex: ""Chloe"" by Grouplove). : The TV at the bar was turned to 4 different things. It was dumb, largely because only 2 games were on. (My wife groaned when I had us switch seats. I wanted to face the TV that was closest to us.) : If you redeem 150 points, you get ""$10 Off Any Meal (excludes alcohol, gift cards, tax and gratuity)."" Note: All prices include tax. : My Pink Lemonade was $3 (there are free refills on soft drinks). : Mozzarella Sticks ($8.67): 9/10. My wife and I each had 4 right away.  Our mozzarella sticks, as usual, were wonderful. My wife likes the marinara sauce too, but only had a little. BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($11.94- the price was $11.25 in 2011): 8/10. My wife is always pleased when she orders one. She ate her sandwich quickly and received a good serving of wedge-cut seasoned fries. : Pepperoni Extreme (Mini- $11.45): 8.25/10. I should have ordered a Small (for $15.21). Still, I was very pleased overall (I could have received more pepperoni, and the edges of the crust were lightly burnt). Next time, I'm going to try BJ's Hand-Tossed Pizza: ""Our delicious thin crust is lightly brushed with garlic butter and topped with the perfect combination of bold tomato sauce, our signature five cheese blend and your favorite gourmet ingredients, then baked to crispy perfection."" : BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger ($8.67): 8/10. They're new. Description: ""On a grilled bun with Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles and our special burger sauce."" I didn't receive any ""special burger sauce,"" but that's cool with me. It kind of fell apart, but my patty was very tasty. My crispy-thin fries were pretty good (I just had to add some salt), but somewhat cold. If we weren't pressed for time (my parents were watching our son), I would have complained about them. My bun was nicely grilled, and my cheese was delicious and gooey. I only received 2 strips of bacon, but they were quite meaty. : BJ's Famous Pizookie®: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ($6.49): 8.5/10. Our Pizookie was a shade overcooked, but otherwise delectable. The scoops of vanilla bean ice cream were bigger than normal. Regular pans were used in the past (tin pans are now used). The Pizookies here were a bit better in the past. Still, I highly recommend them. I laughed right before we left. A guy got hit in the head by one of the revolving doors. He wasn't paying enough attention (he was embarrassed, but otherwise fine). The parking lot should be fixed up a bit. It's pretty ""ragged.""

582,Priscilla F.,"Fremont, CA",129,53,9.0,3.0,2014-02-08,"Long story short: Food was okay, service was not.  Went here last night with a few of my friends and our server was originally a guy named Chris. But since he was going on lunch or leaving, another server took care of us named Nayeli.  She seemed nice at first but first impressions can be deceiving. She took our orders and visited the table ONCE before other servers delivered out food to the table.  She hardly checked on us and didn't even refill our drinks. The wait to get our food was RIDICULOUS!!! It would've been a little better had our server checked on us a few times but she didn't.  When we finally got our food, we didn't even finish because we waited so long. My friend and I split a bacon chicken ranch pizza which was pretty good, another friend ordered fettuccine Alfredo (basic) and another one ordered a margherita fresca flatbread or something like that (chewy bread). After dinner, we ordered dessert. About 15-20 minutes passed before we got our dessert and it was the wrong one and again she didn't even bring it to the table, someone else did. We told the server that our dessert was wrong so she took it back to the kitchen. About 2 minutes later, Nayeli brings out the dessert that we just rejected and said that another server took our order, the kitchen is making another one and to just eat the one she brought out again while we were waiting. Seriously? By this time my friends and I didn't care because she wasn't being the best server anyway, plus a free pizookie is a win for anyone.  I don't know if it was because it was Friday or whatever but service was pretty bad. Waited forever to get our food and they couldn't get our dessert right.  I enjoy going to BJ's but it really depends on the server you get. It might be awhile until I visit this BJ's again.. This is the third time I've received bad service there.

I have been in the industry for 14years and have a lot of patience but this one takes the cake!!! Danielle B in Newark was one of the worst servers  I have ever had. We first waited for 5 minutes for anyone to say hello. I did appreciate that she came and said "" I appreciate your patience"". We had very little interaction with her and when our food came we had no silverware. We were half way through or meal before anyone checked on us..Good thing the food was good! I will give you that! When we first ordered we asked her to put in a to go order and when we were done she dropped the bill with no To go. I asked her about it and she did admit that she forgot! I appreciated her honesty and told us it would be 5 minutes. 25 minutes later she came back with our to go, no discount or even a sorry. All that was said was ""I'll take your check"" which we weren't ready to give. I, as a server understand that things happen, but it is my job to try to make sure the guest comes back. There was nothing she did that made us feel welcomed back or that she even wanted us to return,,,and we won't!!!  YOURE SERVERS ARE TOO STRECHED AND CAN'T HANDLE THEIR SECTIONS!!

That whip cream with the ice cream and cookie is the greatest Peanut Butter Original Chocolate Chunk Aside from the desserts, I'm a BIG fan of the food as well. Some recommendations: Avocado egg rolls - Similar to Cheesecake factory's, yet somehow distinct. Love it.  Chicken Teriyaki - I honestly enjoy this more than teriyaki at any japanese restaurant I've been to, and I'm not ashamed to admit that Chicken Parmesan - See comment above, swap japanese for italian.

It did take a little while for our server to free us but once she did she was amazing and attentive. Unfortunately the chef of the night wasn't up to par. We ordered the cheese sticks and calamari as appetizers. A individual sweet pig pizza, a burger, chicken salad and a pasta. My fiancé ordered his burger medium rare and received a medium well. My pizza was extremely limp and didn't have any pizza sauce! I think the recipe for the thin crust is not a good one as it was extremely soggy. Typically I get the deep dish which is so good. Anyways, the server had my pizza remade which took about 10 minutes. The second go around it had sauce but again soggy.  The manager came by and comped my pizza. Which is much appreciated. Only complaint about the server is the fact that she did not let me know root beer was not free refills and they were 3 bucks a pop! However, one of my rootbeers was also comped so I ended up paying just for 1. We still left the server a 20% tip as the meal was not her fault.

I ordered the California Burger and I took off the green chilis because I do not like spice. The bun is a piece of delicious garlic toast that will you have your mouth watering for more. Order the thin and crispy fries because they did not put enough on your plate to satisfy you. My boyfriend ordered the burger with bleu cheese and bacon (which was gross to me because I hate bleu cheese). He ordered it with wedges and it looked like they put a handful as this huge plate was mostly barren. I'm pretty sure this was a mistake though as I saw the next table over receive a burger and A LOT of wedges.

645,Albert C.,"Milpitas, CA",9,16,5.0,1.0,2014-03-23,"Absolutely disappointing. Decided to give them a few tries before writing my report but after giving them the benefit of the doubt a total of four times, I can easily say they have failed to redeem themselves, and in fact, worsened in quality each and every time. The first time I came here with a friend the wait was alright. Maybe 10-15 minutes, which is quite understandable. I ordered a jalapeno burger with the patty cooked rare. I cannot say how long I waited for the food because I was engaged with conversation with my friend, so I will not comment on it just yet. However when the burger did arrive, my hopeful expectations for a rare juicy beef patty were shot down by a well done. Now I have made my own burger patties before, I can easily say...rare does not take a lot of work at all. When someone is willing to eat their meat rare, please understand that they mean it. Anyways, I told the server the issue, and although they offered to take it back, I declined. Why? Because 1) we had a movie to catch, and 2) I simply don't like wasting food. Ate it, disappointed and disgruntled, but still, tipped our server 15% simply because it was not his fault, and he took the appropriate actions to correct this mistake. Second and third was I was here with co-workers on lunch break. Lunch rush wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately. However our server was harder to get a hold of than the metaphorical needle in a haystack. He sat us down, told us he would be back to take our orders shortly. Our timeline was we arrived at BJ's at 12:00PM on the dot. We did have have our orders taken until 12:20. I did not dare order the burgers again this time. Instead I got the simpler lunch special, sandwich and soup with a side of fries. Much less disappointing as I see less of a chance to screw up a sandwich, soup and fries. However they did give me wedge cut when I wanted thin and crispy fries. Whatever, not a big deal. (At this point I feel the cost is not worth the food) Now today (March 22, 2014) my friend suggests we get BJ's. I wanted black bear, but my friend wanted drinks, so fine...We wait half an hour to have our pager start buzzing. That was once again, understandable and expected due to it being dinner rush. We are seated and we are given time to order. I order the Ahi Poke as an appetizer and decide to give the burgers another chance. Same order. Rare and thin crisp fries. I even told the waiter to make sure it is rare because they messed up the last time. He assured me it would be what I ordered. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. Shorter wait time I suppose. Got the burger, and it is ******* well done again. Not even slightly pink. It is browned in the center! I tell the server, and this time I have it sent back. It takes them another half an hour to get me another burger.  Now I am not saying I am more important than the other patrons of the restaurant, when a customer comes in saying his order was messed up before, and he orders the same thing, only to have the same mistake again. You would expect there would be better communication between the workers, and that the customers service may be just a little faster. If I wanted to wait around in stuffy building for half an hour to be seated, and another half hour to be disappointed, and then the next half hour to be starving, without food, brooding, watching other people eat, and just be out right PISSED, I can do that in the COMFORT OF MY OWN HOME! I can easily just NOT COOK DINNER, AND WATCH FOOD NETWORK, WHERE A REAL CHEF COOKS FOOD AND ENJOYS WHAT HES EATING. I told the server to simply just put the burger To-Go as soon as it finishes, give me my check immediately, I just want to pay, and leave.  This place is absolutely terrible. Never again. I'm telling my coworkers to never come back here again. My friends no longer have a say in where we are going if they suggest FREMONT BJ's. I have never been so upset with both SERVICE, and FOOD. BJ's you guys suck. Yeah maybe you didn't f*ck up my sandwich, but hell if I am paying you guys a cent for half a sandwich, let alone 9 dollars and tip. I'm going to Togo's or Subway.

But we went at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon and got a table immediately. The decor of the restaurant was awesome.  The bar looked nice and we'll stocked.  The place was clean. Overall appearance was great. Service...meh. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order. It wouldn't have been too bad if the place was busy,  but it wasn't.  We ended up placing our orders...we got the fried calamari, he ordered the Bbq pulled pork sandwich with their crispy fries,  and I ordered the new roast beef dip with wedged fries. The calamari breaded and deep fried and served with a lemony tartar-like sauce and a spicy marinara sauce. It was good,  crispy, but a little oily. They could have drained it a bit more. His pulled pork was pretty good. The pork was tender and the flavor was intense. The coleslaw that came with it was warm,  and I didn't like that.  The fries, well, they were fries. My dip...it was awesome! The roll was toasted.  There was a good amount of beef on the sandwich. The Swiss cheese was perfectly melted. The au jus had a lot of flavor. The wedged fries seemed to have a coating on them and were fried crispy, which I liked. The meal itself I give 4 stars. Then came dessert. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia pizookie.  It came out within 5 minutes and looked amazing. It was served with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  We dig in and it was delicious! It could have been cooked a tad bit longer, I think, but the flavor was just yum. We finished that fast. When we left, the place was crowded, and it wasn't even 5:00 yet!

First disappointment - the Cajun Pasta - most blend pasta I ever had anywhere. No spice at all. Tasted like it was just dipped in light tomato sauce. Second disappointment - ordered appetizers during happy hour and it was good but when we ordered more, we were told it would cost more since it was no longer happy hour. No problem with that. What was disappointing was when we were told that the portion would also be bigger because it was at regular price. Been to a lot of places during happy hour and always price was cheaper during happy hour but the portion was always the same.

Also, shady plating of food, if it doesn't look right be sure to ask or you might get stuck paying full price for half an appetizer. What are you trying to do bjs, rip off your late night customers?? If you want to read full detail Its below. I will never be coming to this location again.  Went here on Tuesday night at 11pm, a bit late but there were still plenty of people seated in the dining area and the bar. We were seated very fast and our waitress came rather promptly. Though a friend of ours went to the bathroom so we decided to wait a bit till he got back. We didn't see our waitress come back for at least 15-20 min. Though we saw her walk around, stand at the hostess stand talking with other coworkers, make eye contact with us (as we were trying to suggest we are ready to order) and just continue to walk by again. When she finally came she sounded a bit annoyed under her breath but tried to act nice, I ordered the little bites mac n cheese and my two friends ordered burgers. She quickly then left to put the order in but my friends thought of an appetizer so I suggested the spinach dip. We call her back over, looking even more annoyed she takes down the dip order and leaves. When the dip comes its literally half or maybe even a quarter of the size it usually is, and there was not one single whole chip among the bunch, they were just crumbs and a huge lettuce leaf taking up half the plate. I ask if this is how it comes or if they changed it. The runner said our waitress may have put in the ""happy hour"" portion and she would send our waitress over. Iv been to bjs many times and have never heard of a happy hour portion, and if there was the waitress should have specified.  All of a sudden a new dip was brought out, I suppose its because the first one was obviously a mistake. I ask for more chips since the ones brought out were just crumbs the runner says to me ""crumbs? "" with a puzzled look on his face. Do you not see what was brought out!?  It should have never left the kitchen like this in the first place. After that we finally when we see our waitress and she half heartedly apologized and said "" it's come out twice like this, the cooks must hate me"". Way to look professional and deflect the blame. We find out later a group of 4 had the same thing happened to them cause we can see them complaining to the same waitress we had. My guess is they only just gave each of us half portions expecting us not to catch on and charge us full price. It even took her a good 10-15 min to even get our check. My guess was, she was complaining about us to the manager cause he kept looking over. I do love bjs and go quite often but I will never come to this location if that is how im going to be treated.

253,Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",447,567,3753.0,4.0,2014-05-11,"I highly recommend the honey mustard crisp salad (grilled chicken on mine). Mmm chopped greens tossed with honey mustard dressing, chopped hard boiled eggs, corn, cucumbers and topped with tomatoes, almond slivers, and normally crisp fried chicken strips.  For appetizers we usually get the spinach stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes for ~$5 each! The mushrooms sit atop cilantro aioli drizzle and the artichokes are kinda sour (arrives with ranch). My second favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The cream sauce is satisfying and not too heavy while the chicken is lightly pan fried.  I prefer the crispy thin fries over the mini potato wedge style; both options are available. As for the pizookies, oh gosh are they indulgent. I got tired of basic chocolate chip with vanilla bean ice cream so I've tried the red velvet and new salted caramel ones. All of them are sweet and take some time to bake so snag your server halfway through the meal to order. Btw, Rosario waited on us during Mother's day and was a great waitress.

In one instance in March 2014, all the people at our table enjoyed the meal but got violently sick through the evening and into the next day. Because the meal impacted all of us we contacted the location and the managers comments were basically ""well, it happens, nothing I can do about it"", no apology or offers to make it up were given.  It didnt seem like he cared at all that our ENTIRE table got sick, kinda seemed like a normal occurrence for him.  Three calls (and messages) to corporate went unanswered, seemed like no one cared about us all getting food poisoning. Regardless, we keep going back for cold beers and good times, but are WAY MORE selective of the things we order, mainly Avocado egg rolls and flat pizza apps. My main gripe is that they call themselves a ""Brewhouse"" and the don't brew beer at all. Every drop is private labeled brewed for them by Saint Arnold brewery in Texas.

386,Mystery M.,"Fremont, CA",307,536,32753.0,3.0,2014-06-17,"After my experience here at BJ's today for lunch, I just had to write a review update. I came to take advantage of their FREE Pizookie Day that they've posted all over the web on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their Website. At first, I was slightly confused on how this works. While heading to BJ's, I put down my name on the ""Prefered Waiting List"" using the BJ's App. When we got there the hostess, who was really nice, told us that there was going to be a 10 minute wait. No biggy there, it's BJ's there always going to be wait. The hostess was about right, it was only about a 10 minute wait. When we were finally able to get a table, we were sited in a booth, ones that were meant for 2 people. The hostess had asked used if that was okay and we said yes because well it was meant for 2 people and we had 2 people in our party. It took a while before our waitress came to assist us and take our order. Which was to be expected because BJ's is always so busy no matter what time you go really. When our waitress finally came, she apologized for the wait and for taking so long to help us and take our our order. Our poor waitress seemed overworked and really tired of waiting soooo many different tables. I felt kinda bad for her because she had to wait so many tables. We ordered our food  and then I had asked her about the FREE Pizookie offer that was going on today because of #BJsFreePizookieDay and she told us we had to order it online using the BJ's App because it was a pre order thing. So, after she took our order, I went online using the BJ's App and ordered the FREE Chocolate Chip Pizookie and it was scheduled to arrive at 1:30 PM. The waitress had confirmed that the kitchen had received our order of the Pizookie and that was great and all. The Pizookie came out at 1:20, ten minutes early than it said on our order but you'd think that would be okay right? Well, no in this case it was not. The reason for the deduction of a star was because the Pizookie came out 5 minutes after our entrees arrived, therefore, I wasn't really able to enjoy my entree at all which was a BJ's Mini Lunch Special Pizza. I couldn't enjoy my Pizza because I didn't' want my Pizookie to become hard nor did I want the Ice Cream on the Pizookie to melt. That was the sad part of my meal today, that I couldn't enjoy the Pizza because of the Pizookie coming right after the Pizza came. Even our waitress was like ""OMG, the Pizookie came out already? ""They sent the Pizookie out already"". ""The Pizookie came out right after the entrees."" She did apologize for that as well and told us that ""usually the pre orders come out pretty quickly"". At least next time, I know not to pre order the Pizookie until after my entrees come out so I can at least enjoy my entree first lol. But it was FREE so I guess I can't complain too much... Also, the Clam Chowder that came with my Pizza (you can choose from a variety of soups) was pretty good. I like the Clam Chowder Soup, it was full of rich flavor, clams and potatoes.  The Pizookie was still good, and our waitress was nice and apologized for the mishaps that happened today.

Our server finally brought out our appetizer but forgot to bring the water. We reminded her and it took another 10 minutes to get water and extra napkins. The food was just okay. Our silverware was dirty and I asked her for another set which took sooooo long. We had to ask for more water. Maybe I wouldn't have been so annoyed if she was actually friendly. I asked to speak to the manager. I seen the server talking to her before she came to my table. I told the manager how horrible my service was and how I had to ask for EVERYTHING.

We were seated in the 20 min wait time.  But when we went to our table, it was not wipes clean from the previous seating.  When we pointed that out to our server, another young girl, she went up to the congregation and yelled at them.  They just watched her disinterestedly.   Then she came back, said she was sorry, that there were no silverware and napkins for us to use, and went to find them. She did not try to clean the table, or send anyone to do this.  The congregation was back to just that....their conversations.  Later, she returned with the napkins and silverware, after the appetizer had arrived and our hands were dripping with the sauces. When I ordered my glass of wine, which came in a carafe, she poured it for me.  The problem?  She did not pour all of it.  In fact, she gave me a awkward smile, and took the last remaining bit with her!  What gives? The main course, when it came out was warm, but nothing great.  The flavors did not stand out.  It was mediocre.

PROS: -Expansive menu with great food options, something akin to Elephant Bar. -Pricing is fairly decent, there are definitely ways to save money if you make good choices. -Nice atmosphere, kind of like a younger and trendier PF Changs or Elephant Bar. CONS: -Busy, busy, busy. We've walked up to this place on more than one occasion and we're told there was a 1-1.5 hr wait, wow! You're not allowed to call in ahead of time to get a reservation either, perhaps after a certain time maybe. -Given that it's busy, the waiters attention can be seriously compromised. Our waiter had issues coming regularly or when needed and would sometimes walk away before an order or request was fully resolved, strange! -It's a fairly loud atmosphere, especially around the bar area. Sort of a great place to go if you want to have more than a few drinks, talk loud, watch the game, and be merry...just be wary if you're thinking to bring certain people. -My spoon or fork was super dirty with a huge chunk of something on it...something nasty but I forget what it was...we told them but there was no consideration given...we even had to bug them b/c they forgot to replace.

I feel as though they have made improvements since then, with the exception of the Newark location. I have NEVER had a good experience here. I don't know why I keep coming back expecting different.  I'm in the service industry, so I tend to be way forgiving when it comes to the wait staff. But when I leave this location upset every time, it's not a good look.  My first visit to this location, the manager had to comp the entire bill bc the food came out wrong. We're talking 0/4 orders correct. And cold. And I was never given my drink throughout my meal. Ever. Even after 3 requests.  My most recent visit was no different. Started off with a quote for a 40 min wait. For my husband and I and my infant. On a Sunday early evening. Okay. I guess we'll wait. Then the host asked which I needed for the baby, a booster, or a highchair. My baby's 3 months old. Tiny. So I explained to her that he doesn't sit on his own yet. So neither. (He was sitting in his stroller, not carseat, so I told her i didn't need a sling either) 55 min later, they realized they had skipped over us and said it would only be 10 min more. Oookay. 15 min later (so closing in on an hour and a half wait time. For 2 people) we were walked over to a high top table in the bar area.  First, that area is open seating, so if you were going to seat me there, was there a need to have me waiting for that long? And second, you're going to seat me a high top and expect me to pull up my stroller next to the table? So I'm going to tend to my baby sitting almost 2 ft higher then him? She agreed to get us a regular table. But of course we had to wait a little longer. 5 min later, she was ready to redirect us to our table and asked me to leave my stroller in the lobby. My now sleeping infant son was nestled in his stroller. So obvi I was confused. I explained to you he doesn't sit up on his own. And you can see I don't have him in his carseat and I explained that to you as well. So you're expecting me to pull him out and what, hold him the entire meal? To add insult to injury, she led me down some stairs. With my stroller. Really??  So we established the hostess had no clue what she was doing. But the food. C'mon!!  I ordered a water and a beer. Never receive my water. I ordered a sandwich. And thin fries. No substations. No special nada. Straight off the menu. Still wrong. Wrong sandwich. Wrong fries. My husbands too.

In fact, we asked the manager after 45 minutes if our salads were coming out before he brought them out, as well as refilling out waters after they sat empty for 20+ minutes. My mixed drink tasted like cough syrup, not that our server asked at all to see how our drinks or entree's were. Also, 2 of our guests ordered broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl, only to wait 50 minutes to get Clam chowder in a bread bowl. When they let the manager know they ordered broccoli cheddar he said he'd have it fixed in a moment only to come out 5-10 minutes later to inform them that the cooks made a mistake and they had no more bread bowls but they he could bring them a small bowl of soup and remove the two soups from the bill. So we sat there for over 2 hours, got most of our entrees messed up, as well as no refills, and the soups also never came.

After a long wait I called ahead to be informed that there is no option to reserve seat for three or more persons in advance and i was conveniently added in call ahead sheet or list or whatever that is supposed to be. It was my husband's birthday so I asked them to inform the server to add that in as well. I was told that the request was considered but you need to again inform when you walk-in. I was like OK! Come evening my husband and I with our child check in and are told that unfortunately we were never added on the call ahead list so now you have to wait like all others. On top of that the server we got couldn't follow an ounce of English and brought food in like super late. Finally the surprise never happened I went and asked the manager and he says will take care of it again I wait patiently requesting my husband to sit at the table one way or the other nothing happened. I paid the check and expressed my disappointment to the manager on the way out he didn't seem to give rat's ass. Well so much for loving BJ's. I visited the one in Cupertino so much practically did a project on them at school. Now I feel some other deserving restaurant could have had been my subject of observation.

Were told it might be a min. We checked in again at 6:20 & had to wait 10 more min. It was obvious they had lost our reservation especially after we were finally brought to our seating. We were cramped & overcrowded, against a wall.  we're a big family,  so we're used to it.  They brought complimentary cheese sticks to apologize within 5 minutes of seating us,  but didn't take our drink order for another 10 min. They forgot 4 out of 6 requests for water.   Then 10 more min to order.  By then we were getting very hungry had been there almost an hour, so we ordered 3 more apps & all our entrees.  They brought the apps but no plates, we had to ask 2 times.  I sent a drink back because I didn't like it. I had ordered it, but it was very sweet.  The server brought me something else right away.  Our food came at 7:30,  most of it anyway. They had forgotten to order 4 entrees,  & had made 1 entree twice. They took that back.   I later found out that my grandaughter had ordered one kind of soup but had been given another. (It was her birthday.) I asked why she didn't tell us. She said she was just too hungry to send it back.  I asked if she liked it, she said it was not her favorite but she didn't care.     About now you must think we're a bunch of complainers and eventually we did all get fed.

506,Maria C.,"Fremont, CA",0,59,,2.0,2014-09-25,"BJs. Where to begin? Well, first there's the name. We'll leave that for a site that won't chuck this review based on it's user policy :) We've been in and out of this BJs for over a year, and while I fell in love with this chain in Boulder, CO, it's not the best here. Why, you ask? Noise ------- the noise level in here is off the chain ridiculous. We've canned it from our moms-night-out list of places to go because even yelling, we often can't hear each other. And I don't want to yell at people I like. I'd like to yell at the wait service, though. Wait Service -------------- Listen. I get it. You're underpaid, supposed to make your cash on tips, have too many tables, and I'm sure some of us customers aren't as nice as the others. But seriously, don't help make the situation worse, cuz, as they say, it's the little things. Like when you bring a tray of 4 drinks to the table but 3 straws. And then say you're sorry, you'll be right back with one. But never come back. Or, when you come to the table with hot soup, but there's no spoon. And say you'll be right back with one. But then proceed to take the order of the table RIGHT BEHIND US. You realize we can hear you, right? We can see you, right? That's just a slap in the face, in my opinion. It's like saying, ""You know, Mr Customer, I know you can't order your own soup and get it from the kitchen. So I'm going to let that HOT dish sit in front of you and grow colder by the minute, until I damn well feel like getting a spoon for you."" YOU set the expectation - YOU said you'd go get it... and yet you don't. For 9.8 minutes, on average, over 4 visits. Yes, it got so bad that we'd TIME YOU over MANY visits and chuckle as the $20 bills passed hands, bets collected and cashed in, winners and losers announced, as we gambled on how long you'd be gone. You want a tip? Give me service. You want a good tip Give me good service. You want a great tip? Well, you get the idea. The Food ----------- As a first time reviewer of you, but long time eater in your chain, I understand that I'm emotionally scarred from your chain's decision to pull the stuffed baked potatoes. I admit, I was a bit miffed when I was told that, after WANTING to pay for a $10 potato (come on, let's just say it, we all know it's really worth $1.50 in costs), that you're complaining to me about the time it takes the kitchen to prepare it. Which tells me the kitchen isn't looking to cook, they're looking to reheat. Which brings me to the last point - the food quality is OK, for what it is - but it could be so much better, particularly when the menu is priced squarely in the average range of $14/item, $20-$22/meal. And when we leave? Yup, you guessed it. My man wants to visit McDonalds, because he's still hungry. Quality -------- I want to end on this final note. You are what you serve, in the restaurant business; a lot of times we'll put up with crappy wait service, or rude wait service, or NO wait service, if there's good food and drink. However, you sold me a roughly $4 cream soda with no carbonation. After asking for something with bubbles, and being looked at with incredulity (because, you know, customers take a perfectly fine glass, drink none of it, and send it back for fun, and you, you decide you're the soda police and want to question my word, despite seeing not a single bubble on the side of the glass), take 15 minutes to work it out with the bar, who tells you there's something wrong with the batch, and there are no more batches. OK, I'm disappointed, but things happen, I get it, let's move on. Imagine my surprise when I saw more trays of bad-batch soda being served to other customers. It's a small thing, I know, but for a chain making it's name on the every-so-hot marketing monikers of ""Hand-crafted"" sodas, it tells me that you knew there was a problem (despite how we got to that discovery), and continued to serve it anyways. Which makes me wonder about what's on my plate. EEKS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=500,2.92,2.98,3.008,2.7600000000000007,2.956

We asked to speak to a manager and he came over 20 mins later, and said he was completely unaware of the situation.  Gave it another chance tonight and all we ordered was the pizookie trio. 20 mins after ordering they let us know they were out of the peanut butter pizookie.

Just like any other BJ's Restaurant, the place has full bar access, booths, and tables. This place in particular has a long wait time on a lot of times I've been here. There were times when we left because the wait was too long and it was already late.  We were seated quickly this time. Our waitress came quickly and provided us with menus and waters. We scanned through the menu and decided on two appetizers and an entree. We got the chips with spinach dip, buffalo wings, and chicken pasta with angel hair. We also got two drinks: your typical Stella and a raspberry cider. The food came pretty quickly and we chowed down right then because we were so hungry. The spinach dip was so good and it warms your mouth. The dip was thick, but in a good way. The buffalo wings were great and the portion was huge! It also comes with celery and carrot sticks. The dipping sauce for the wings was a little weird for me. It was a spicy liquid-y hot sauce. The pasta was so delicious! The angel hair spaghetti was cooked well and the white sauce was great! The chicken was also very tender and juicy. Maybe I was just hungry, but everything was really good. I definitely recommend the raspberry cider though! It's one of the sparkling ciders so it's not even like alcohol. It just tasted really fruity and nice.  The service was also good. Our waitress came and checked on us many times to make sure that things were going great. Other servers dropped by and asked us how we were doing as well. I don't come here much often, but the food is good whenever I come, so I am satisfied with this place. I will most likely be returning one of these nights.

But I got one of the two tables left in the bar area.  Within minutes, standing room only.  Service was prompt and efficient all the way through my time there.   Especially considering how busy it was.  Food was just OK. I had a rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and roasted asparagus.  The ribs were pretty good. But the salad was just a bunch of lettuce in a bowl with bottled dressing on it.

We sat down and weren't helped for about 10 minutes. Once we looked at the menu and figured out what we wanted we waived down our waitress who zoomed by and told us that she would be with us shortly. So another 10 minutes go by and she finally takes our order, pitcher of beer and burgers all around. It took about another 15 minutes for the beer to come and then another 10 minutes after that for the food to arrive despite the place being relatively empty. Plus since we all ordered burgers, it should be pretty easy to make instead of making 4 different dishes.  We requested that the burgers be cooked medium, yet we all got burgers that were for sure well done. No pink in the middle and it was not juicy at all. We could have asked for this to be cooked a little more, but we were worried that it would take forever for us to get our food back so we ended up just eating the brick of meat.

A friend of mine wasn't very hungry so she got two appetizers, her calamari came out completely cold so they sent it back. They also got avocado egg rolls so while they were waiting for their calamari they were about to take a bite and a nice big hair was sticking out of it. Those got sent back as well. On top of that when the calamari came out we realized they re-fried the SAME calamari. So it was literally like hard rubber. We just said forget it and we don't even want it anymore just take it off the tab. On top of all THAT, we had all had our entrees out and my boyfriend was still waiting for his. At first it wasn't a big deal but after we asked over 3 times they brought the manager Rich or Rick out whatever his name was and he showed the slightest sincerity or care at all. He was not at all apologetic or seemed to care. So they're probably just used to giving terrible service. He just kept telling us ""it'll be right out"" ""it should be out soon"" (it was just a small lunch entree by the way, just a piece of fried chicken on some mashed potatoes) you would think it was the most extravagant thing on the menu. By this time almost all of us were getting out plates taken away because we were all finished and then they finally brought out his damn dinner. We came to have a Birthday dinner together with our friend and he didn't even get to eat at the same time as us. And on top of THAT we told the waiter it was our friend's birthday and he started taking care of our checks already. When we got our checks we told him again and he brought out a mini pizzookie for him.

182,Lou-Lou M.,"Hayward, CA",56,2,2.0,2.0,2015-01-14,"Service: Came in here earlier for dinner. My friend and I got here around 6:30 pm. We only waited two minutes to get seated. But, it took 10 minutes to find a waiter to place our orders. Our food came 10 minutes later, but the waitress assigned to our section didn't appear until much later. She seemed nice, but for a restaurant staff servicing the dining room, she didn't smell clean. There was one time when my friend and I took a whiff of her body odor as she walked past us and it made us gag while chewing on our food. That's pretty gross. Food: We got our food rather quickly. We only ordered two dishes tonight: 1) Shrimp Scampi Pasta was EXCELLENT! This dish comes with a generous amount of flavored shrimp over angel hair pasta tossed in a light, perfect blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and diced Roma tomatoes. They dish was topped with grated Parmesan cheese, and a dash of bread crumbs and chopped parsley. A full order is about $19, but the serving is enough to be split in two. We truly enjoyed this dish and will definitely get this at the next visit.  2) A large, hand-tossed pizza-half ""BJ'S Favorite"" AKA The Works (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) and half ""Sweet Pig"" (best known as Hawaiian). Both flavors look good on paper, but both failed in taste and texture. Both sides of the pie were dry. Our pizza was served on a cold ceramic pizza plate-not on a hot, stainless pizza pan straight from the oven. The pizza pie/crust didn't taste fresh either-it got cold and chewy fairly fast. Very disappointing. Summary: The restaurant is simple and airy. The crowd is good and decent. Noise level is fair. Tonight's dining experience was below average in my opinion.

They need more attentive wait staff or I'd think twice bringing a family here because you'll wait a long time to get served. The food came quick, but we weren't asked even once if we enjoyed our meal.  I'll highly recommend Shrimp Scampi Pasta.

I thought it was going to be good so I ordered an extra pita taco. Unfortunately it was not good. There was no flavor and it was very bland, not to mention the order was messed up as well.

I went to Newark to meet a few friends for lunch, and they suggested BJ's, so I met them WAY OUT there.  The parking situation was incredibly awful.  I have to park near the door in the handicap parking area at the moment, but there was no easy way to make that happen due to the construction and the poor signage in the lot.  They have the regular parking area fenced off from what looked to be the employee area.  Okay...I will hobble, whatever.   After fighting my way through the cumbersome parking area, I entered the restaurant and the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner.  I told her I would be meeting friends, but right then I saw them standing up, waving and yelling at me...embarrassing ;(  lol I meandered over to the table with Jociel to meet all of our friends awaiting our arrival so they could order.  Nate greeted us at the table and he remembered me from about 5 years ago at a restaurant nearby...WOW!  (I wish I had that memory, my studies would move along so much faster!) He even called me ""Tall Skinny Vanilla Latte"" remembering that I was drinking one when we met and it was easy to describe the drink because i am tall, skinny and vanilla...but anyway... We ordered a few items to begin with: Corn Fritters Ahi Poke Tuna Artichoke Pizzette The corn fritter were crazy good!  They were hot, fresh and delicious.  Served over an aioli sauce that was to die for with real corn nibblets to garnish the dish.  The Ahi was amazing as well.  A pretty large portion for a small bite share plate, but who is complaining?  The little pizza arrived and it was spectacular!  It was hard to save any to take home... Nate took such great care of our every need, even the two people who arrived late.  I would give 5 stars, but that parking was a fiasco!  If I were the manager I would not only complain but would also seek to resolve the parking issues during the construction.  It really is inconvenient to the guests, especially for guests with mobility issues. Nate gets 5 stars, but BJ's as a whole--4...   Stephani Smiles for BJ's ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=220,2.76,2.79,3.04,2.6719999999999997,2.7779999999999996

928,Jamie T.,"Newark, CA",16,9,1.0,1.0,2015-02-09,"ZERO STARS!!!! Management is horrible particularly Desiree. Our server was slammed in the bar and appeared to be new. My kid's drinks came out after my husbands beer and my soda. I let that slide. While I was waiting or our meal I watched how Desiree the manager, talked with 3 servers just standing around. If it's not busy enough where you can all stand around talking then either help the girl struggling or go the F&$& home! While I'm still observing the manager and her unprofessionalism. My husband and two children received their meals. The food pony then came back to tell me that they were just making the lettuce wraps. These were ordered of their happy hour menu and are not regular sized which is fine but a burger and two kids meals were done before. We were not once checked on by our server or offered refills. After out meals were done for 10 min. and still no one my husband told the hostesses we needed the manager so we could let her know of our unpleasant experience as well as the bill. In comes Desiree who we had to interrupt from her 20 min conversation. She picked up my husbands dish and without talking to is shouted to our poor overwhelmed server to get our bill. When out server walked over I told her to bring her manager back. When Desiree came back she said all you wanted was the bill right?! That's when my patience ran out! I told her had she picked up more than one dish from the table or not talked for the last 20 min and noticed me trying to get her attention that maybe she would know how unpleasant our dining experience was. I told her we never got a refill, my sons drinks came out last and my lettuce wraps were never made like the rest of the order. She the. Said, ""Fine do you want me to take off the lettuce wraps?"" At that point I told her she should do more which she didn't and how unprofessional she is for talking for the last 20 min about non business related items with employees while our server struggled. Normally I don't ask for discounts but at that point the bill should've been mostly comped not the happy hour lettuce wraps which was the cheapest for her to take off. I AM SO IRRITATED! Next is corporate. She needs to be trained again....BJ's service is starting to turn into the quality you got at Red Robin before they closed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=940,2.76,2.85,3.032,2.372,2.814

I went out of my way to drive all the way over there and when I arrived the manager informed me that he did not have the time to get me the receipt.

I like this location because the parking is so easy (usually, but right now there is construction going on FYI) and it's also not too big but not too small. The bar is the perfect size so that everyone in the bar area has a good seat to see the TVs.  I'm a big fan of BJ's food so the consistency here is definitely appreciated!

586,Kenneth L.,"Fremont, CA",23,32,9.0,3.0,2015-02-16,"This would be a 3.5 stars review if possible. My friends and I went to watch the NBA All-Star game there. We sat at the bar tables and had the carnitas fries with chile verde as well as a large BJ's favorite pizza. The ambiance is nice. It's definitely a nice place to watch games with friend. The massive tv at the bar area makes watching sports pretty great. The waitstaff is nice but generally very busy. This means that they'll take awhile to come back to you and ask you if you need refills or are ready to order. That's really because BJ's always seems to have a fairly long wait (the bar area less so than the restaurant section). All in all, this place fits the criteria of a nice place to watch a game. The food and drinks are what you expect of BJ's. Decent food but fairly pricey. The carnitas fries were good, a little bit too much salt in there though. The carnitas were tender and the chile verde complimented the fries and carnitas well. This was probably my favorite thing I had there that night. The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was pretty good as well. Not the most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had but definitely a good pizza. It had a little of everything (sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, olives) and the flavors blended well (obviously, because its essentially a combo pizza). The crust was quite addicting (I'm not a crust guy either) as the dough was crispy on the outside while still maintaining that nice chew in the middle. Again, this was pretty salty, so if you don't like salty foods you should probably stay away from this place. For my drink I had the root beer (because I wanted refills.....we were there for about 3 hours). I was tempted by some of the alcoholic drinks but ended up getting the root beer instead. I'll probably come back to try some of their alcoholic drinks. As for the root beer it was definitely one of the best root beer I've ever had. They come in a frosted mug (essential because it keeps the root beer cold while not diluting it with ice) and unlimited refills (I had about 5 rounds of root beer).  All in all, I spent about $17 (including tax and tip) for this meal. Not horrible because of what I went there for (decent food, drinks, and watching the all-star game with friends) but definitely not cheap. I would definitely come back once in awhile to watch some sports with my friends but probably not regularly or even semi-regularly. My PSA for this place would be that I did slip into a salt-induced food coma after getting home.

The food is for the most part consistent and the service at this location has improved over the course of the past 12 months. They feature over 120 menu items that include calorie estimates. There are several ""EnLIGHTened"" entrées, salads and lunch specials which range in calories from 460-850. Some of my favorite menu items include: -- Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi (460 calories); oven roasted mahi-mahi served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice. The mahi-mahi is always cooked to flaky perfection and the fried rice is almost as good as Benihana's without all the buttery guilt. I suggest asking for soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce on the side if you want to kick things up a notch !! This dish pairs well with a glass of Barefoot Chardonnay; not too expensive and on point ($5.95 glass/$20.95 bottle.) -- BJ's Favorite Mini 6"" Deep Dish Pizza (~753 calories);  Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives, white onions, and seasoned tomatoes.

And at this point my blood started to boil.  But my sister (being the sweetheart that she is) tried to just go with it and attempted to eat it, but today is her birthday and being her older sister, I was NOT having that. Our waitress finally came back and I relayed the appalling event that just occurred. She was shocked, apologized quickly, and got my sister a bun. I cant say I've worked in foods or can deal with the things they go through, but I don't think its difficult or rocket science to put a bun on top of a effing burger.... I really appreciated our waitress and I appreciated her apology even though she was not at fault. I hated that she felt that she needed to apologize for something that she did not do. So waitress, YOU ROCK! I wish your co workers had the same work ethics as you do.  And to the management, Please train your staff on how to deliver good customer service, IDK how tired you might be, there is no excuse for such rudeness. Your front desk and waitresses are great but we will not be coming back again.

We waited a good 10minutes for our server to come but we had to ask another server to take our order. Food was about 10minute wait. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. It had too much vinaigrette dressing which made it a bit sour. I ordered this before and it wasn't as sour. I also ordered the calamari, but they ran out! Which was sad considering I was pretty excited for it.  I also ordered the beignet with vanilla ice cream, but there was no vanilla ice cream! They offered the chocolate ice cream but we decided to cancel the order. When we did, the manager came over & told us that the vanilla ice cream just arrived & they were going to give it to us complimentary. Which was nice of them. The beignet was warm with a crispy outside & an soft inside! The ice cream was a good portion & I enjoyed the strawberry sauce.  This wasn't the best experience I had whenever I come here.

I really do think in recent time, the whole experience has gone down.  I came here with a couple friends to watch the Warriors NBA Finals game. As expected, the place was crowded. It didn't seem like they had prepared for the rush as when I walked in they told me they only had 4 servers for the entire place. I didn't know how I was to respond to that, so I sat anyways. Between my friends and I we ordered a couple drinks, appetizers, and pizza from the happy hour menu. We got the drinks and appetizers, and 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas still weren't here. I knew it was crowded, but this was too long so I asked the waitress to check on the food. She comes back 15 minutes later with two pizzas. She hands me mine and said it had been sitting out for awhile, because somebody dropped my friends' pizza on accident without telling anyone. She claimed they had reheated mine and gave it to me and brings out some other pizza for my friend, a different one than the one she ordered which was really odd. My friend sent it back because the pizza she brought out had pork, which she doesn't eat. And my pizza was cold! Even though she said she reheated it. I sent mine back to be heated AGAIN. Finally she comes back with my pizza and the pizza my friend had ordered. But since mine had been reheated so many times, it was soggy! It literally felt like they had just put it in the microwave it was gross.  Finally when the bill came, she charges us the regular price for all the food and drinks instead of the happy hour price! That was really frustrating, and is a huge mistake. When we told her she wasn't very apologetic and just said she would talk to her manager. Especially when going during happy hour, make sure that people double check their bills as the servers don't seem to be doing their job properly. This place is understaffed, and the waiters they do have are incompetent. They really need to get better.

Second hiccup on their end was the fact when we ordered calamari it seemed to come out a little under proportioned, I didn't want cause a stir but a friend tried to question the waiter who brought them out but to no avail what was done was done.

A lot of people may find this annoying as orders may tend to be slow, but our waitress was very attentive and made sure our orders were taken and delivered promptly. I also like how diverse their menu is, there's always going to be something for everybody. We ordered all appetizers for dinner. We tried the Sliders, Chicken Wings, Crispy Calamari, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Sliders and Crispy Calamari were yummy, but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt like you could order the same thing else where and it would taste the same. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also just okay. It was tasty, but I felt like it could have tasted better. I wasn't really impressed until I tried the Chicken Wings, which we all loved! It was /that/ good that we needed to order another plate to share! The skin was crispy and the meat was just moist and it easily slid off the bone. You know chicken wings are good when they don't need to be dipped in sauce! For dessert we had the Cookies n Cream Pizzookie-- chocolate and Oreo cookie that's a size of a small pizza, topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream, caramel syrup, and chocolate chips.

First of all their hostess (one female and a male that night) are rude. No smile no greetings just out right ""for how many"" is how they started. The hostess told us that the wait is about 10-15 minutes, so we figured... Oh ok the wait isn't that bad. Wrong! 35 minutes later our name wasn't called yet, so I ask the hostess about what happened to the 10-15 minutes wait? She said well there's a lot of people and you probably have to wait another 10-15 minutes more.  The sad things is I keep seeing they're giving other people with a party of 3 and more a buzzer to let them know their table is ready but they didn't give us a buzzer. The couple who was in line before me had already been seated long time ago and other people with buzzers already been seated and we are still waiting.  45 minutes later and we are so hungry, our names had not been called yet. We decided to wait an available seat at the bar and when my hubby finally got one, we decided to just eat there. So after an hour we finally got seated at the bar and got our order taken immediately. I have BJ's two starts for the waitress who served us with a smile and for the waiter who cleaned out the table so we can seat and eat.

So we didn't think much of it till 30 mins later we seen two employees give another customer a pazookie with a lit candle and they said ""enjoy!"" Not even us did they say anything.

220,Cindy E.,"Milpitas, CA",148,4,2.0,4.0,2015-11-12,"BJ's has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but since the baby was born, this was our first chance to come as there are not many locations near us. Our party consisted of me, my husband and my 2yr old. Although the food was good, it didn't amaze me like it used to. The Buffalo Wings have sauce on them. If I remember correctly, they used to be dry with the dipping sauces (buffalo & ranch) on the side. We liked it better that way. They just taste like any other Buffalo Wings now.  What really disappointed me was my child's food. Luckily he liked it though. Why? Because his Mac & Cheese was out of the box! He has that once in a while at home but I make it better! I cook it longer & add cheese for flavor. BJ's kid meal Mac & Cheese was chewy, clumpy & lacking flavor. I added a pic to the photos section. The BJ's non caffeinated, no fructose syrup root beer was delicious & a big hit with the kid. The chilled fresh fruit was yummy & sweet. The Kid Meal was reasonably priced at $5.75.  The Hubby said his burger was ""good"". The bun was soft & not too ""doughy"". The double patties were grilled to his satisfaction. My Zitti tasted a lot better than it looked. It was delicious. Didn't look like the picture where you can see the pasta poking out of the sauce. When I received it, I saw a little pan halfway filled with crusted cheese. Didn't see the pasta until I scooped it up with my fork. Extremely flavorful. Although it didn't look like a lot, I couldn't finish it bc the oil started getting to me. The oil naturally accumulates at the bottom of the dish and after a while I felt like I was drinking it.  Our server was friendly although she forgot a few important things. She handed us our food without our silverware & napkins. The wait time for the food was great although the wait time to eat the food (bc we didn't have any silverware) was not as great. We still tipped our waitress generously for her smiles, apologies & effort.  Although we received our meals very quickly, it took our Pizookie dessert almost 4x times that wait. It was nice that our waitress came by twice to apologize & explained that they were backed up in the kitchen. We had trouble staying awake as we were so full and just longed to be home since we had quite a drive. Just as we were about to cancel our dessert, we received it. I normally love Salted Caramel everything but the Pizookie flavor was just too much for me. It was too salty & too sweet at the same time. I'll remember to not order that next time. I did love my husband's Peanut Butter Pizookie though!  Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Husband's meal was free as he was a veteran invited for Veteran's Day. I am extremely appreciative of BJ's support of our veterans. I heard about BJ's special meal through Facebook (many friends were having a meal here too) & since it's our favorite restaurant, I decided to surprise the Hubby with this treat. Being a Stay At Home Mother & having a hard working, dedicated husband, we all deserved this special treat on this special day.

They charged us for a Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, even though I was not getting any chicken or any sort of meat.

We found refuge at BJ'S around 10 pm and stopped for a late dinner. My salad and wine were amazing. S, however did not enjoy her salad. When we told the server, I think her name was Melissa, she very hesitantly offered to take it away which made S feel uncomfortable so she kept the salad and never took another bite. We then proceeded to order our meals. When they came out, S's meal had been prepared entirely wrong which was immediately visibly apparent and we voiced it as such. The food runner apologized and excused herself to fix it. I then started on my meal to find that my Spaghetti and Meatballs(which I specifically ordered without chili flakes due to an allergy) was COLD. I called over Melissa and explained my problem. She then proceeded to stick her fingers into the plate of Spaghetti right in front of me at the table. As a server myself, I was appalled! She offered to have a new one made and I obliged.  In the meantime, as we're having these problems, the manager, Brandy(?) Is standing in the to go area as Melissa acts as our messenger between management and the table. And what is Brandy doing? Putting away boxes and chatting. S is a restaurant manager and I have worked closely along management as a server for years. We were both extremely shocked to have not been visited by a manager at this point.  So, time goes by and we receive our remade meals.  S's comes out wrong yet again, and mine has chili flakes. I take one bite and I'm on fire.  So, we call over Melissa yet again. Tonight just isn't our night and we'd like to pay for what we enjoyed from our terrible experience and hit a drive thru somewhere.  She makes a trip back to Brandy and returns to our table with a check charging us for everything and still no visit from Brandy.  That's when I asked Melissa what the manager's name was.  Only after that did we get a visit from her. She walked over, already familiar with our situation and started going on about how busy she is and how she's the only manager and how she's stuck doing to go's. NOT OUR PROBLEM We sat in disappointment watching her for at least 20 min waiting for a visit before we actually received one. And her ""being so busy"" entails talking and laughing with her subordinates and putting away to go boxes and bags. I have always enjoyed my excursions to BJ'S and make a point of visiting several of the locations in the bay area frequently.

255,Payal P.,"Union City, CA",40,118,115.0,2.0,2016-01-04,"This experience is mainly for the service and not the food. Food was fine and pretty normal for BJs but the service was pretty bad. I don't know if it was because the server seemed new or not but it was just not good and I don't know if i'll be back at this location in the near future. Had a table reserved for 8, including 1 baby/toddler. They had reserved a booth but anyone who has a kid knows how fussy babies can get in crowded spaces so a table would have been better? Just to be able to get out in case of bathroom emergencies.  Anyway, so we all sit down and the server eventually comes to us, we order our drinks. When she returned with the drinks, we gave her our appetizer choices since we were still undecided on entrees but just to start the night since we didn't want her to have to wait around forever and be confused. PS BJ's drinks are soooooo sugary. Anyway, we gave her our appetizer choices and asked to have a small pizza made to come out with the appetizers for the toddler since she was getting a little rowdy and hungry.  She comes back a little while later and takes our entree orders. We had a family member who was vegetarian and asked her about more vegetarian options and she completely blanked. I understand it's an extensive menu but I would think it wouldn't be too hard to remember a few vegetarian options since there aren't that many but hey, maybe she just didn't know. Instead of asking someone, she didn't really give us a straight answer and we just haphazardly chose a vegetarian burger since there seemed to be nothing else, at least not that she could remember.  Eventually we got all our appetizers but then.... no pizza. The toddler is becoming fussy at this point and just wants her food. We ask our waitress how long it would be for the pizza and she says ""oh no! I added it to the entree order instead of the appetizer order!"" Let's just say the toddler's parents were not happy. Mind you, there had to have been about 20 minutes between when she took our appetizer order and when she took our entree orders. So did she not put in the appetizer order right away or....? i don't even know but yeah, not cool. The baby's pizza had been cheese with olives and asparagus. When it eventually did come out, it was olives and only the end parts of asparagus. You know, the really hard parts? The ones you would usually throw away because you cannot chew it? Yeah, that's what was on the pizza meant for a toddler. Needless to say, she didn't eat them.  Overall, sorely disappointed with this experience. They were nice enough to toss in a free pizookie for my parent's anniversary but my parents still did not enough the overall experience. I think the should take a little more care when kids are involved because unlike adults, they are not patient. Maybe if there hadn't been a kid involved, we would have been more patient or accepting of the situation. But not when a baby/toddler is fussing and obviously hungry.

We went on 01/02/16 around 4 and was seated right away, it was not at all that busy. After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes we had to flag down someone and ask if our waitress could be sent over. After 10 more minutes just as we start to stand up to leave she finally appears. By then we knew what we wanted to order, forget getting the drinks and coming back!! We gave her our order which included side salads and soup. Someone else dropped the side salads and soup off and rushed off so quickly, we couldn't tell them we had no utensils. I finally got up and walked to the hostess stand and asked them for napkins and utensils. Just as we started eating those items our food came out. So now we have everything at once. On the menu the fish and chips state that it comes with tartar and vinegar, our plate did not have it. We flagged another waiter down and asked for some ""oh did you want some?"" Ah yeah, it comes with the dish so why wouldn't we want it? Half that meal was ate by the time we saw those two items. I started to eat my chicken which the breading was over cooked and hardly had any lemon sauce, it was luke warm while the mashed potatoes were cold.  Even after getting our meal our server did not stop by to check in on us. She walked by and we watched her fawn all over several other tables that were all seated after us. We did not receive a refill on our beverages and in the end had to ask someone else to get our check after sitting there for awhile. Our waitress brought over the check and then wanted to know how things were. When we said we were never offered refills she asked if she could get us any, ""I'm leaving now chick!!"" She then wanted to know how everything was. Told her all our issues with our food and with her and not to expect a tip. And that is exactly what happened, no tip.

The waiters that assisted us were friendly and very flexible (as in they did what ever we asked). The presentation of the food was excellent and a work of art. The taste was even better than presentation with various flavors overwhelmed my tongue in the best way possible. With a hint of spice, my guacamole-bacon hamburger was built to perfection. My meal never fell apart when I lifted and bit it. For desert we got the trio. In the trio, we got the salted caramel, triple chocolate, and original. The Salted Caramel was my favorite for its flavor enhancing ingredients. The triple chocolate suppressed my chocolate craving from the whole week. The original was a sweet taste of the past, having a sweet, warm cookie under a nice cold vanilla ice cream warmed my coldest memories.

My boyfriend ordered meatball marinara and he enjoyed it as well.

It does not come with ice so I got that too and I enjoyed it. Very concentrated so I recommend ice and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry splash. I tried it and it was decent I guess I'm not a alcoholic slushy drink type of person but if you like sweet and slushy get it!  Service: our servers name was Joselyn and she was so nice.

I decided to take my kids to lunch before some fun activity and arrived around 2:30.  The hostess took us to our table and after that we didn't see a waiter for ten minutes to take our order for drinks or food. Our waitress eventually showed up and attempted to take our order but she failed to listen to us as we had to repeat ourselves 3 times. She left and we doubted we were going to have the right drinks but she got it after all. She took our food order and had really bad attitude as if we were an inconvenience to her and what she was doing. The food came and my sandwich was super dry. The toast was burnt and the chicken was dry. I ordered the wedge salad which resulted in a bath of dressing which ultimately ruined the meal in the long end. I've had this same meal now twice and for going on a busy Saturday dinner with a great experience to this on a dead Friday lunch time, pretty upsetting. Our waitress checked on us about 10 minutes after someone else brought out our food. Again the tude... Then she went over to the wrap around booth next to us full of young guys with the most energetic greeting and made flirtatious talk. We later learned it was another employee and his buddies. Another waitress joined her as they all talked. She then came back with her tude to see if we needed anything else. We ordered two pazookies and she looked at us like we were crazy to want to order them. She dropped off our tab and went to her buddies at the booth for more flirting.  Our pazookies arrived, we ate them and I left the worse tip I've ever left anyone. Feeling guilty but the service wasn't even tipable.

One of our servers did inform us that pizookies were free with a purchase of at least $10 every Tuesday until July (also half off wine! like.. bottles included!) so that was a plus.  The thing that kinda made me EH about this place was that I left my credit card with the bill when I left the restaurant (I have a problem doing this...). I called back to the restaurant because I know for sure I left it in the bill as it was nowhere in my car or wallet and I realized it was missing on the car ride home. I called back to the restaurant and they didn't have it... After checking my credit card online, a $50 purchase was made somewhere in Newark that was not by me. So...

Thankfully, the BJ's deep dish filled up the void. With all the sports TV's, I couldn't have unassumingly picked a better place; every shoulder turn there's a new TV to look at. The staff must hate LeBron James because as soon as it cut to his post-game interview, they cut off the sound. LeBron is a true nemesis but I can't deep down not admire the guy; I could have listened to him for a couple minutes. You'd think as a Warriors fan I'd be all for the Golden Pilsners, but not quite. I almost never go without the Jeremiah Red Beer (toasty amber hue). And I never finish without doing a Pazookie (baked cookie with ice cream on top). This particular staff is almost rock solid. I only found one of the four hostesses a little airhead-y, but the waiters and waitresses like to think two steps ahead of the customers (except when it comes to the cheque; I'll wave anybody down after this much waiting post-Pazookie. Come on!) Good kid's menu. Good coloring book and crayons. Good iced water. Good beer (for me). Solid 3-stars, but there's upside here if you need sports TV viewing.

I go inside to pick up my order so I can continue on to work since I was on my lunch. I get to the side desk for quick pick up and I see my food just sitting there on top of the back table and the server who is assisting anyone with curbside orders just looks at me, looks away real fast as if trying to purposely avoid eye contact and then continues on sending out orders to other patrons. No ""hi welcome to BJ's"", no ""one moment miss I'll be right with you"". No, I got none of that. Just her awkwardly avoiding eye contact with me for the next 10 minutes while I'm burning holes into her with my stare. I want her to see I'm getting impatient. She FINALLY addresses me in a half-hearted ""one moment"" then jets off to go to another order. Umm, when it come so customer service you at least address a patron who is wasting their time and spending money in their establishment. And you most CERTAINLY assist the person right there in front of you and not someone who has not even gotten to the restaurant yet for their order.  She finally checks me out for my order after waiting a grand total of 16 minutes when it was supposed to be a quick pick up. Hence the reasoning behind why they have this service in the first place.  If you hate your job then change it. Don't take it out on the patrons going to your establishment with no smile no welcome just your bitter attitude. Yuck, where's a different BJ's at?

I went here last night with my boyfriend and we ordered the spinach dip and chips, calamari, a couple of ice teas and root beers, and a large deep dish. Spinach dip: The chips were stale. The spinach dip was burned on the edges and the portion was only filled up half way through the bowl it was in. My boyfriend even looked at me and asked the waitress why the portion is so small. The waitress said that the bowl was just big and that's amount of the dip was their standard amount... lies. I've had more before. it also looked like the dip has been sitting in that bowl for hours cold and then they popped it in salamander oven to heat it up and it got burned.  We hate to send things back to the kitchen and who knows what happens in there with our food. Calamari: Last time my boyfriend and I went there, there were only 8 to 10 pieces of calamari on the appetizer plate, the size was so small, I could grab all 10 with one hand. The plate it was served on was huge as well so it made it look empty on the plate. last night, they had a smaller plate so it seems more on the plate when there wasn't. ice teas: They put too much syrup on the flavored ones.

100,Iris M.,"San Mateo, CA",116,12,1.0,2.0,2016-07-14,"I've eaten at a few BJs before and this by far was my least favorite. My boyfriend and I stopped by here to eat dinner, before our movie at the AMC theater across the street. Upon walking in, the hostess took about 5 mins before she acknowledged us when the worker in front of her told her that there were customers that just walked in. Yet, she decided that folding napkins were more important.  My bf ordered, a side salad which had only about 3 croutons in it. Where are the other croutons? Did they run out? Next came our spinach and artichoke dip, which was delicious! However, after serving the dip, we noticed that it wasn't even filled half way to the top! We probably only ate about 6 chips with it. So disappointing for being a $10 appetizer.  Now for our meals, I got the roast beef dip and my bf got I believe fish tacos. He was pretty pleased with his food, but as for me, the dip was too thick for an au jus, and lacked flavor. I did not enjoy it, and didn't eat it. The best part of my meal was the thin cut fries and the honey mustard I asked on the side. Overall, I'd choose other places over BJs if I am ever back in Newark. Our server was great. Very attentive and friendly. It's the food portions that need improvement. Especially, being a big franchise such as this.

Once seated we waited for 20 minutes with no service. We had already figured out what we wanted within 10 minutes. We were not offered any drinks and more than 4 different waiters and waitresses walked by clearly trying not to acknowledge us.  We then decided to leave and returned our menus to the hostess. All we were given at that point was terrible service and a 'Sorry' which sounded like a question, ""I'm sorry?"" Did not feel like talking to the manager. We were too hungry at that point so we wanted to leave as soon as possible.   Any other times/experiences this place would have gotten an easy 4 star.

It was pretty good, but my medium rare came out well done... almost too well. The burger would have been slightly dry if I didn't add generous amounts of hot sauce. I know it says its an open faced burger, but do you really have to but the patty halfway on each bun? Presentation was underwhelming since the over easy egg was too wide and covered everything else. Fries were okay and tasted a bit stale like they sat in the kitchen window a bit too long. Pizza is always a safe bet. Do not get any of the pasta or rice dishes. Pasta is under-seasoned every time. Jambalaya is an exorbitant $17 but isn't even close to authentic and was way too salty. Pizookies! This is the best thing here. They have a supersized pizookie that is not on the menu. For $25, you'll get a giant half baked cookie the size of a large pizza with half a gallon of ice cream stacked on the center. Their alcoholic mixed drinks are pretty good. About $10 each.

Great customer service and the food and drinks were very tasty. I think this is a newer location because the interior is very new and pretty looking. All of us enjoyed our lunch! We did make a reservation for our larger group and the table was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Our waitress was Randi and she was very accommodating and friendly.

332,Ashley W.,"Dallas, TX",91,6,2.0,2.0,2016-10-28,I called in around 5pm on Friday and spoke with someone about happy hour. I asked if they offered happy hour and they said yes until 7pm. I asked if it was in the bar only or in the entire restaurant. I was told it was in the whole restaurant. We came in around 6:30pm and I asked to see a happy hour menu. The hostess told me our server would have one. We were seated in the regular dining room. When the server came by I asked to see the happy hour menu and he told me happy hour wasn't available in the dining room. We were already seated and told that they could not do happy hour outside the bar. The whole reason we came early in the evening was for happy hour and then we were seated where it wasn't offered. I wanted to move to the bar but didn't want to make a scene. Ultimately the food was good. I had chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken and potatoes were hot but the broccoli was not. Overall I am not satisfied with this experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=340,2.96,3.13,2.928,2.248,3.062

They have different flavors for each Pizookie and a thing called a ""Pizookie trio"" where you can try 3 mini pizookie flavors for about $10 dollars! I got the chocolate chunk flavor, UGH.

All you can eat soup and salad lunch special--you can pick and choose from any combination od their soups and salads.  They usually have some light soups, some creamy soups, and some hearty soups--perfect to go w their house, cesar, or wedge salads. Grilled Fish Tacos--only comes w two, but the serving size is actually quite filling along w the chips.  I recommend the grilled fresher fish over the fried frozen fish.

So this was the final straw we will be looking for another BJ's with better service and that actually bring change back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300,2.6,2.97,2.912,1.5400000000000003,2.822
38,Jules W.,"San Jose, CA",3,97,,2.0,2017-01-05,"I'm so sad to report that I will NOT be returning to this location. The last two times I came I had to return my drinks... Last night I had to do so twice! I just gave up. One of the bartenders  thought they were being smart by replacing my weak ass long island for an even WEAKER one thinking I wouldn't notice the difference. He must have been on something good. LI drinkers know what to expect, as a bartender you should have known better! Two things about me you should know, don't mess with my FOOD and don't you dare serve me a BS Long Island. 7 liquors in that bitch and I can't taste ONE? Fk out of here. Really? They gave me a carbonated lemon-aid! You know it's probably one of the most  (if not, the most) expensive drink on any menu so please miss me with that.   It definitely wasn't our waiters fault however he wasn't much better. He could have apologized for, 1) me having to send back the first drink 2) me having to send back the second drink 3) when our salads came, asking us a BS question like ""Oh, do you not have utensils?"" ( Do you see any? Your salads aren't that great that we're gonna sit there and stare  at it!) 4) Give or take, just being a monotoned as waiter. No smile, no real greeting, not really attentive. Maybe he was having a bad day, I get it. However, when your customer is clearly unhappy, the least you could do is apologize. Not because it's your fault, but because your team is messing up and therefore messing up your tip! Your money! Ain't nobody got time for that. But it's obvious to us that you could have cared less.. and that's fine honey. So, we up and left that bitch. ( Bj's, not him LOL) We ordered apps which were probably already in the making that we never got. That went to waste. The two drinks that I had to send back went to waste, tho I would have been happy with them just making it proper by adding more liq instead of making two weak ones. The salad that we got but never ate went to waste.  So good job you've wasted all of those items Bravo!  Went to Elephant bar, had a REAL drink and a REAL waiter and ended up having a bomb ass date night regardless. I believe everything happens for a reason, even shit like this, and I was meant to have a wonderful waiter and proper drinks that night. So Thank you. P.s Extra star for the delicious water that was brought out pretty quickly.

We ordered some drinks (Alabama Sunrise!) which were great. I had two. The woman that brought us the drinks placed the obviously alcoholic drink right in front of my obviously young (11 year old) nephew. That made me uncomfortable. Side note: If you're sensitive to spice, do NOT order the fried chicken. They pour peppered gravy all over it. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. It was amazing!

Surprisingly we were seated right away, thought there would be more people to watch the games. We sat at a table in the main dining area. About 5 minutes went by and no service. We realized that during playoff games they have happy hour specials, but in the bar area only. There was plenty of open seating in the bar so we moved. We were greeted right away and had the specials explained to us. During happy hour all draft beers are a dollar off and cocktails are $2 off. All appetizers, including the huge sampler are half off along with the mini deep dish pizzas. To start, we ordered drinks. Our first two beer choices were not available because they were out. My wife's second beer choice was also not available because they were out as well. We ordered the large appetizer sampler which comes with avocado egg rolls, chips and artichoke dip, BBQ boneless wings and cheese sticks. That was enough to feed us right there. Didn't realize how big it would be, we ordered 3 mini pizzas as well. The mini pizza is nowhere near as good as a larger deep dish. They were a little over cooked and minimal toppings. Overall, this is the worst Bj's I've been too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=20,2.32,2.94,2.872,1.512,2.692
4,Steve C.,"Hayward, CA",14,19,23.0,3.0,2017-01-16,"I usually only review a place if it's a 1 or 5 star place. Either you had to be really mad enough to remember to write a review, or the experience went so well you feel compelled to shout your love to the world via Yelp reviews.  Today's experience with BJ's was mainly an indulgence trip; I came literally for the chocolate chip pizookie.  Like a genius, I decided to order the full size version with a glass of milk for just one: me. This experience definitely is best left in your mind. However I do think I won't be thinking about eating a whole pizookie ever again.  Let's break this review down into sections: customers, environment, cleanliness, location, parking, food quality, service. Customers are standard of a family friendly restaurant. Some families are here, some couples, some old friends who deserve their own sitcom where they can sit-calm... I'm punny. That's how we Filipinos say ""funny"".  The environment is chill. Got some paintings on the wall and tvs with sports on them. Music is okay. Good enough to blend into any conversation without you really giving a crap about the music.  Points docked for cleanliness. I arrived around 3pm so it's not too crowded, yet my table still had obvious residue. I do not want to lean my arms on the table. the seat was fine tho.  This location is right off the freeway and near Newpark Mall so it's like Landmark status. Easy to find and the parking (at least for 3pm). FOOD QUALITY!!! Caps lock helps wake up the readers. The pizookie was too big for me to want to finish alone. This definitely requires 2 or more in my opinion. The flavor is good though. The outsides of the cookie are crispy with a gooey chocolatey center. So the cookie isn't fully cooked. It is crunchy outside and gooey inside. If this is what you like more power to you. The vanilla ice cream quality is okay too. You can see the vanilla beans in the ice cream. The milk is standard milk.  SERVICE.... A bit slow. I can understand though because I am not the only person this waitress has to worry about. She helping lots of other people so I forgive the wait times. Midway through she had a dude named Mike come and replace her so she can take her lunch break. This guy is okay he is chill. I just wish he was around to ask for the check earlier than I found him. But it's okay I won't make a big deal out of it (says a Yelp reviewer; I cannot be trusted).  I have given my thoughts on my rubric, but I have not had the chance to check out the bathroom. I usually enjoy describing a restaurant's restroom because a clean restroom shows a restaurant has pride and good work ethics. Maybe I'm just OCD idk.  WHY THREE STARS THO? YOU ENJOYED THE COOKIE!!!  The main reasons were service, wait time, cleanliness and price. For a glass of milk and the pizookie full size its 10.32 and a 15% tip is 1.42 making the total $11.74 which is a bit much for only being able to finish half of the pizookie. Maybe even less than half. I feel a bit jipped off at least for what I paid. Then again the server did say they had a mini pizookie for like $3.XX I should have just gone for that one.  The service was good enough, but no efforts to make me feel ""special"" or give me a memorable experience were attempted. Not sure how happy the workers are here. I don't blame them though, I hate customer service myself. Yelp is cool tho cuz I get to be that anal customer reviewing stuff lmao. I mentioned the table not being clean earlier, and the wait time was slightly longer than ideal.  If I wanted to be nice I would rate this a 4 star, but trying to look at this review as corporately as possible they might rate itna 3 star. Personally I guess I would say it's a 4 star, but I'm trying to give an unbiased opinion.  That was my review you made it this far and you deserve something great like 10% off your next BJs visit or something. Unfortunately I cannot grant that request so I hope my thanks is good enough.

300,Deborah C.,"Fremont, CA",57,31,3.0,1.0,2017-01-23,"I'm not feeling the staff or the customer service here at all! A few months ago I went here with friends. We parked next to some guy who was getting high and smoking a joint in the car next to us. It turned out that after we waited a long time to be seated, the guy who was getting high in the car ended up being our waiter! With that being said this dude could not remember anything we asked for, (more napkins, drink refills, silverware, the bill, etc)!!! Bad service. So the next time we tried this place, my husband and I went here around 4 pm. It wasn't very busy. The rude hostess who mever smiled or even acknowledged us demanded my phone number so she could text us when seating was available. Keep in mind there was plenty of seating available. So I did and asked how long was the wait. She said 15 minutes. I noticed several people who came in after us but they were seated immediately and we just sat there like idiots waiting for a text that of course we never received!!!  We walked out. I won't be back. Very rude hostesses who have no skills or training in basic customer service and they have high waiters who smoke weed in the parking lot before coming into work and then forget you're there! This to me is a direct reflection on their management. No one's in charge! No one's watching the store and the employees are allowed to run game on their customers without anyone calling them out on their rude and very unprofessional behavior! It's a nice looking restaurant with a good menu but it will fold soon because of the lack of management or just straight bad management. Pay attention to how they treat you when you first arrive.

My son loves this restaurant so I decided to take him to dinner there tonight. On the website there was a coupon for a free pizookie with a purchase of 9.95 or more so I was excited to redeem it. Our server JESSICA was friendly but when we asked about the free pizookie she got all weird and asked us to show her the coupon. I pulled up the website on my phone and showed her the coupon and she stayed staring at it for a while. She finally said it ""worked for her"" but when she gave us the bill it had still charged us. I let her know that we were still being charged for it and instead of just fixing it for us she made us feel super embarrassed and said it's probably because we weren't signed up for rewards or something. She just really didn't want to honor the coupon for us and we felt super embarrassed so we just paid for it and left. It's not even about the money, it was the fact that she made a big deal about a coupon that was on the website. Workers there should know the promotions going on and not make their customers feel embarrassed just for trying to use a coupon.

The server (Jessica) acted confused and was looking at it like it was a made up coupon. It was pretty embarrassing to have her question a coupon that was clearly on the website. She then gave said okay and we got our dessert. We got the check and the coupon was not applied and she acted like she wasn't aware of it then proceeded to say that maybe you need a bjs reward for it. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that you needed a rewards from there. She should have honored it because it was a coupon from the website.

234,Cristina R.,"Fremont, CA",0,9,4.0,2.0,2017-02-07,"When first arriving to the restaurant I was so disappointed I wanted to just walk out. The hosts in this location are absolutely rude and inattentive. You have 3 hosts at the reception desk and yet none show a warmth and friendly welcome, as you would receive from any other family restaurant. I stood in front of the reception desk literally for 2 minutes before the hosts acknowledge my arrival. I was told to follow the hosts, just to find the my table is still dirty and the table had not been properly cleaned. We stood in front of our table with the host waiting for our table to be cleaned. The hosts never apologized and said ""we have been really busy"". I literally looked around and saw less then ten tables with people. I was offended to be lied to literally in my face. Her incompetence to assist is far below the standards of BJ's and I am honestly surprise that management settles for less.  The waiter who assisted us was very genuine and caring. Her upbeat attitude makes me feel like this place as a chance of survival. She shared her recommendations and was patient. The food came out at a decent time and everything was hot and steamy. The crispy flat bread nachos and the boneless chicken wings were my two favorite appetizers. The flat bread was crispy and the toppings are evenly spread. Every bite was an orgasm in my mouth.  If you go t BJ's you are obligated to get a chocolate chunk Pizookie for your dessert. Cookie perfectly chunky and warm. When leaving- the hosts just gathered at the Reception Desk ALL on their cell phones with their heads down. None of them welcomed us to come back.

The waitress said we can have separate checks which was great because there was allot of us and we all ordered different price items. The waitress took our order and it took 55 minutes to get our food. We were looking around because we wanted to check on the status but no-one would stop by. We saw that allot of the tables around us were having the same problem. The waiters where by the cashiers chatting away. Finally we started getting our order, and one of our appetizers was not out yet. It came as the last dish and when we asked to take out the second appetizer because it had been like 1:25 minutes since the waiter said the kitchen already made it. We asked to speak to a manager and she tried to argue that the avocado rolls were already made. My couleage insisted on talking to the manager. The manager got there and we asked to get  the avocado rolls taken off the bill and told him about our experience. He was arguing that the avocado rolls were requested as regular dishes and not appetizers. Then three coworkers got the lunch specials and they were charge dinner price. When the coworkers asked the manager about it he called over the waitress and the waitress said they never specified they wanted the lunch special price. WTF!!!! The waitress was this young asian girl and i think she had colored eyes. The manager was a young caucasian guy. Both who were useless and ridiculous.

Then the manager brandy came out and pretty much told me that next time I order a salad , I should specify that I don't want parsley. (Ok first of all how am I supposed to know it even comes on it if it doesn't mention it in the ingredients on the menu) it was just the fact that she went out of her way to come and say that to us, it was just a turn off . And then made it a point to say ""I'm not tryna argue with you"" no one was arguing we were just taken off guard by the fact she came out in the first place. And lastly wedge salads DO NOT have parsley on them so why I should I have to specify this??? Luckily for the fact that I was starving, the friendly guests and sweet bartender I stayed. Update :::: Just made a pick up order and came to realize that our avocado eggrolls were missing and when we called to verify a lady on the phone was very rude and condescending to us.

We had two orders that never came (including the birthday girl we were celebrating).  Appetizers, salads and main dishes all came out within 2 minutes of each other; our server was so apologetic and nervous that she accidentally knocked over a glass of ice.  We could not believe that she would not be given an help to assist with the multiple parties! To get to my point about the onsite manager Brandy(I believe that's her name)...she had an annoyed display all over her face that she had to walk over and speak with us...isn't that your job when you have unhappy customers??  She proceeded to make excuses instead of being proactive!  She stated how it was not her job to help the server.  We stated, we weren't asking her to help Amber BUT to get Amber some help!  That's what GOOD management does!  You ensure your team is set up to succeed so the customer experience is awesome and they want to return to your establishment! Just terrible management!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=80,1.8,2.56,2.84,1.5720000000000003,2.2560000000000002

378,Mindy R.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-26,"I would give this place 0 stars if that was an option. Being there are limited places in the area to accommodate a large party of people we didn't have much choice but to eat here.  I blame the management for the problems we had. They had a weeks notice about our party of 30 and clearly did not prepare. After being seated one waiter took our drink and appetizer order and then I guess he left so after a half hour we finally tracked a server down who took drink orders again and then promptly forgot what we ordered. The manager was clearly overwhelmed and did not have a handle on the restaurant. After the waiter brought half of the drinks we ordered and forgot what the order was that he took 15 minutes before he then proceeded to argue with our table that he didn't take that order the other guy did and he just got here. We reminded him that we just gave the order to him. I don't know if he was high or had a learning disability but he was not all there. When the dinner order was finally taken needless to say we were a little nervous and with good reason, as the dishes started coming out things were not what we ordered and there was more confusion. To top it off the man paying for the dinner did not get his food.  After the third time of being told it was coming the waiter finally admitted it was given to somebody else.. wtf. There was no offer of compensation for the bill which when finally tallied was 1,296 a good gesture of the manager would have been to take 10-20% off the bill. The bathrooms were disgusting no toilet paper in the stalls and again excuses from the staff 'the hostess is supposed to take care of this, there is supposed to five of them' PATHETIC is the best way to describe the restaurant and the staff we had people from all over the world and it is a shame that i as one of the American's in the group was extremely embarrassed by the quality of service and treament we rececived.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=400,1.8,2.52,2.812,1.6680000000000001,2.232
160,Theresa L.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-02-26,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went to BJ's Brewhouse in Fremont, CA on 2/25/17 for one of my birthday dinner celebration with 12 of my friends. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I made the reservation for our large party several weeks in advance and confirmed the reservation on 2/23/17. In my opinion this was more than enough time for the restaurant to ensure that they were properly staffed Well they were not. Our reservation was for 6:15pm but we arrived early and were told that we would be seated as soon as our server arrived. We were seated at 5:45pm. We had one person taking our orders and we later found out that this was her 2nd shift. Our server apparently never showed up. As meal after meal came out, many of which were either wrong or missing items we asked for a manager at around 7:45. By this time everyone had been served and me and one other person never received our entrées. The manager, Brandi, came to the table very defensive I might add and told me that our orders had never been placed. As one of my friends was trying to explain what had been going on. Brandi said ""I don't want to argue with you"". Lady no one was arguing We were just stating fact. Brandi walks back over to me and asks if I still want my food. Uuuhh no thank you. Everyone else is done and I've been here for 2 hours already. The sad part is that Brandi was trying to blame everything on our server. Sorry it was not the servers fault that you had them working a large party of 13 people alone and on top of a double shift. Brandi as the manager should have called an all hands on deck including herself.  At one point she says I will be back in a minute. I had to go to the front counter to find her after she hadn't come back for a while. Oh I'm sorry that's probably because the other large parties were screaming and having the same issues as we were. Everyone knows with a party of more than 6, you need an additional server for the party. Brandi finally comes to the counter and says ""I'm sorry your birthday dinner didn't work out. I wish we all could've had a better evening"". Seriously I done at that point. She comes to the table and gives me and my friend who both never received our meals a $25 gift card. I will never use mine because I will never go to BJ'S again and will encourage others not to waste their time. After spending too much time trying to figure out our bill and getting that correct, we fnally left the restaurant at 9pm. Really...!!! 3 hours and 15 minutes and the birthday girl didn't even get a meal....absolutely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=160,1.76,2.48,2.812,1.7000000000000002,2.192
306,Shelly F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-02-27,"My Burger was good!  Cooked just as I ordered it, hot , fresh...  BUT the SERVICE was horrible and just because of that I will never go to this place again!   Our server Amber was great!  She was handling multiple large tables and it was very apparent that she needed some assistance.  Which I'm not sure WHY she wasn't partnered up with another server since there seemed to be several servers just standing around. Anyway, the large parties were pulling her in every direction, asking for this and that, fixing orders, getting water etc.  So our table asked to speak to the manager, NOT to complain about our server, but to ask if another server could help out and maybe provide better service.  Well I guess this was NOT a good night to ask for the manager because Brandy approached our table with a horrible attitude.  Assuming she was stressed from multiple complaint, just from what I saw (but that's your job right?) We began to ask if there was another server that could help and explained what was going on, she basically ignored everything we said, proceeded to tell us that this wasn't what was going on and so WHAT COULD SHE DO FOR US?  We said get our server some help. Her response was ""well I don't serve, I can't help her and I don't want to argue about it""  Who's arguing lady?!?!?!  Uhmmmmmmm you're the manager, you should be willing to do whatever needs to be done.  Anyway this went on, the service didn't get any better and she basically just stayed away from the large party section so she didn't have to deal with EVERYONE in that section complaining. As a ""Manager"" there was a better way to resolve this issue and make everyone happy.  But, I guess Brandy was just not in the mood to do her job!  The entire experience sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=280,1.76,2.48,2.808,1.7640000000000002,2.192
223,Naomi C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-28,"I went to BJ's on 2/25/17 for a birthday dinner/celebration with a group of around 11/12. This was, by far, the worst dining experience I have had EVER! I mean, I've had better service, experience and food from McDonald's. I encountered the rudest ""manager"" (using this term extremely loose here) I've ever come across in all my dining experiences. Awful! For the large party we had only ONE waitress waiting on us. This is very unusual for a large party especially since our waitress had two other tables and the other table's party was almost as large as mine. While our waitress was very attentive to what we needed and made sure to ask us if we were okay every chance she could, the food she brought out was either wrong, incomplete, cold once it got to us or missing something. After watching this young lady hustle and juggle my table and the other two she had AND watching about three other employees just stand against a wall and watch her, I encouraged a ""manager"" to come over. The ""manager"", Brandi, came over with an attitude and very defensive (unwarranted). I tried to explain to Brandi what was going on and asked if she knew that our waitress was the ONLY one serving us as well as the other two very full parties and, with the great attitude (facetiously stated) she had replied ""I do. So what's the problem?"". The problem is that, BJ's managing style displayed through Brandi, totally caused this young lady to just about fail. This ""managing"" style set her up to fail while other employees set back and watched and nobody tried to help her or display any amount of team work. Brandi, the untrained manager, then stated ""I don't want to argue with you"". Absolutely uncalled for! Argue? Not a single person at my table raised a voice, displayed any amount of defensive, aggression or actions one should be alarmed by, so this, was extremely insulting. Extremely! Brandi proceeds to ask me ""how can I  help you"", I stated, verbatim, ""get her some help"". Her reply was ""I don't do any serving and I'm the only manager here"". I again stated "" Get her some help. I didn't ask you to serve"". What kind of managing style is BJ's adopting here? A manager can't roll their sleeves up and be a teammate? She is absolutely disgusting in this role and should not be one to represent BJ's...at all. This ""manager"" tried to blame our server when it was NOT the server's fault. BJ's manager, Brandi, totally failed her. This managing style totally failed her. The kitchen totally failed her. BJ'S FAILED HER! I am disgustingly offended at the fact that I've freely given my hard earned money to a company that's totally okay failing it's servers. A company that has such a manager in position who can't see past a title and play the actual role. From ONE MANAGER TO ANOTHER: Brandi, you should have played the roll of the manager, pulled up your sleeves, assisted where needed, called a meeting with ALL staff and adjusted so the immediate needs of your customers AND staff were met. You failed both your staff and our party. Lastly, I am, even more disgusted that, the would be celebrated young lady didn't even get her meal and all this ""manager"", Brandi could say was ""I wish this experience could have been better for the both of us"". AWFUL! UNACCEPTABLE! Tell me again how this night wasn't well for YOU when WE patronized the store YOU ""manage""? And received nothing? I'll wait. If anyone wants great service, drive down a little bit on Mowry where there is a Chic-Fil_A. Managers are AWESOME and customer service is extraordinary.

Whether it's an intimate date night or you're coming in with all your coworkers at the end of the night Bj's has something to offer everyone. Bj's is one of those restaurants that was a wide ranging menu that will cater to everyone.      My personal favorite dish here is the seared Ahi salad (yum) if you order the seared ahi salad be sure you read all of the ingredients. The first time I ordered this salad I didn't really read the description fully and didn't realize the salad contained dollops of wasabi so I accidentally swallowed a giant dollop of wasabi thinking it was avocado lol it wasn't too bad but it definitely caught me off guard      A lot of people will complain about the wait but I really don't think it's that bad and I feel like everyone knows how bad the wait can be and it shouldn't be something that surprises you. The only real complaint I have is from the recent visit last Saturday, my date and I were sat at a regular table and this may not make sense to people who don't have tables that open up but the leaf of the table on my dates side kept unhinging and falling into his lap.

261,Mars S.,"Fremont, CA",971,410,301.0,2.0,2017-03-21,"I don't know what it is about BJ's. I've definitely had a handful of enjoyable times at the restaurant, but at the same time, I've also had an equal number of less than satisfactory visits.  Although their food is better than Applebee's and Chili's, BJ's has never wowed me and can overall be completely hit or miss. Sometimes, I'm 100% happy with my meal, while other times it's just completely off. For example, once I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and it was pitiful, coming out with 3 pieces of avocado instead of having it piled on like the menu's picture. Another time my friend ordered the sante fe salad and replaced the chicken with salmon as she does not eat meat. The salad came out with both salmon and chicken which was odd, and she ended up having to send it back to the kitchen. In terms of service, again, I've had an equal number of visits that it's been just fine and other times where it's been awfully slow. Overall, for the price, inconsistency with food/service, and the always ridiculous wait times, BJ's is not the place I'd suggest going with a friend given all the amazing new restaurants that are popping up in Fremont/Newark. Additional things worth mentioning: - Lots of cool beer options. I'd suggest taking a seat at the bar with a couple of friends instead of indulging in a full dine-in meal with a larger party as that's where BJ's tends to mess up more. - Huge parking lot, but it's always really full.

We did manage to score seating at the bar that was a plus. I received the level of service and quality of food I had expected.

The wait was not bad being it was a Friday evening, we started off w/ appetizers which was calamari, and an order of a small bowl of pale ale chili w/ chips. The calamari came and I noticed the lemon had mold on the inside of the lemon wedges the waitress noticed me looking at it before I can snap a picture of it and asked if there was a problem I showed her the lemons and she apologized and got us a new order of calamari, the chili dip was not what I asked for and instead I was served a all cheese dip. I kept it to not make a big deal but our food came out rite after we had received our appetizers so I felt rushed to eat so the main course didn't get cold. The whole experience at BJ's unfortunately was not what I expected.

I came on a Saturday night with friends and there was a 50 minute wait. We started started with a few alcoholic drinks and calamari. I wish the calamari was served in smaller bits and slightly crispier. I ordered the shrimp tacos with tortilla chips. I asked for nothing spicy but still received salsa that was too much to handle.

269,Kathy T.,"Hayward, CA",304,104,141.0,4.0,2017-04-18,"BJ's is one of my favorite places to get ""American food""- I think that's the best way to explain it? I go here a lot because like I said, it's one of my FAVS!  APPETIZERS: -Stuffed mushrooms: 4/5 I have no clue what goes inside these little mushroom but it tastes amazing! Perfect combo of crunch with softness. Only reason not 5/5 is the price. You only get 5-6 mushroom for about $13. I only get these when I'm balling!  -Calamari: 4/5  I love that BJ's give two dipping options for their calamari, fav is the white sauce! Calamari here has the perfect crunch. Same reason for it not being 5/5.... why is it so expensive! Such a small plate for basically the same price as an entree.  -Avocado egg rolls: 3/5  My boyfriend loves these but I'm not the biggest fan. I think it's too much avocado? I'm also not a huge fan of the Asian like sauce, reminds me of sweet and sour. Of everyone I know, I'm probably the only one that isn't a huge fan of these egg rolls.  -Chicken tortilla soup: 5/5 Hands down my absolute favorite tortilla soup, EVER! I'm serious! I love those soup, I've tried chicken tortilla soup at many other places, nothing fulfills my craving like BJ's! ENTREES:   -Blacken Atlantic salmon: 5/5 My favorite! I have no idea how they do it! It has the perfect taste and the sauce that comes on the salmon, delicious! Comes with rice and steamed veggies, great combo. -Chicken Parmesan: 5/5  Usually this plate comes with red sauce. I'm not a fan or red sauce (marinara) but at bj's it's a delicious lemon white sauce! I order extra of that! AMAZING! The chicken is nice and crunchy with the amazing sauce poured over it. Side of mash potatoes and broccoli....... YUMMERS!  DESSERTS:  -Bizzokie aka Huge cookies! 6/5  Cookies and cream is my favorite. But so far whatever I tried is still pretty good as well!  BEERS: They have ""brew house"" in their name, meaning their beers should be good. I agree with that fact! I enjoy their Hefes and blonds. I like their berry cider but I DO NOT like their pear cider.... taste like cleaning appliances.  TIPS- if you know you're coming out name down on their app! Worth it!

I ordered a mini supreme pepperoni pizza and their hand crafted root beer soda. I called when I was only ten minutes away from the restaurant to put in my order and when I arrived my order was ready. The pizza was the perfect amount for a single serving and the root beer was okay. My only disappoint about the root beer was I've tried it before when I ate at the restaurant and it was served in a icy cold chilled cup, when I ordered it to go it came in a plastic cup and not as cold. So, probably will pass on ordering their hand crafted sodas to go.

We waited for about 15 min for a table for 5. We were seated but was not given the special menu or told about the specials. Went ahead and Ordered artichoke and spinach dip for an appetizer waited a while for that. Our soup and salad came out but we didn't have utensils. Had to ask for those. Main course we ordered 2 prime rib specials, comes with either a soup or salad and then 2 sides and pizookie. I asked for prime rib medium and my husband asked for his medium rare, both of ours came out well done and tough. They took his back and made him a new one. Waited at least 10 min for the new prime rib, it was better. Asked for ranch and it took 3 reminders. Also ordered a sirloin and a small pizza. Now still waiting for our server to come back to order our pizookie. We've been waiting for 20 min. We all finished our food at the table still no one has come back to check on us. Still waiting and managed to finish writing a yelp review. This will be our last visit here, not spending anymore money at this joint. Definitely need to improve their customer service and be more attentive. 1 star for their beer 1 star for their pizookie. UPDATE:it's 8:59 had to update my review since we're still here and been here since 7pm. Asked to talked to manager and she just said there's a lot of things going on and asked her why our server just never came back she said he had some issues he couldn't deal with and had to get sent home.

75,Kevin A.,"Union City, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-08,"In short: Stay away from this establishment. Corporate needs to step in.  I arrived on a Sunday evening with a party of four. The restaurant itself was somewhat crowded so I was expecting to have to wait for a table - which I did, no big deal. My party and I are seated in an uncomfortably dark area isolated from most of the other restaurant patrons. As I fear and expect we are left waiting for nearly ten minutes before a waiter attends to us, again no big deal.  At first he seems like a nice guy, a bit awkward but nice, I'll refrain from using his name as I don't want to publicly humiliate him for what follows. He proceeds to take our drink and food order and again we wait another solid ten minutes before he returns with our drinks. As he begins to hand out our beverages he spills a noticeable amount on the table, my arm, and my clothing. I catch him look down but he makes absolutely no effort to rectify the situation - no apology as he quickly dashes from our table to check his phone at a register station.  Another ten or so minutes pass before our appetizers are brought to the table. Stuffed mushrooms with spinach and cheese. One would think - 'how hard is it to possibly mess up a stuffed mushroom'. Well you guessed it, BJs did. They were not only cold and flavorless but about the size of a quarter. Awesome.  At this point I call for a manager, something I've never done at any other establishment, ever. A couple minutes pass before a middle aged women approaches the table and asks what the problem is. I begin to explain the situation to her and she looks noticeably uncomfortable as if she has no idea how to handle the situation. She offers to refund us and bring our meals out regardless but at this point I've lost my appetite, I tell her I simply want to pay for what I've consumed and leave. She agrees and apologizes and leaves to grab our check for us. Again we wait for what seems like another ten minutes before a waiter comes to our table with a comp'd check and apologizes to us, ""sorry our manager is dealing with another problem right now, she'll be out in a few more minutes."". Unreal. We gathered our things and walked out the door.  Never before have I experienced such horrible service from the top down. From the host staff, to the servers, even the management. Every aspect was abysmal. Never again will I return to this particular establishment. There is however one shining star here - April.

88,Angela C.,"Union City, CA",13,14,5.0,1.0,2017-05-23,"On Sunday 5/21 around 6pm. my husband and I went to the Newark, Ca location to have dinner.  My husband ordered a small pizza, pepperoni extreme I believe. We weren't given plates or utensils so when the food arrived he was just gonna eat it from the pan. When he took a slice what looked like a glob of cheese fell from the slice. At closer inspection, we realized it was some sort of condom or finger protector. We were absolutely horrified and disgusted!  For one, this is extremely unsanitary! Condom or not, it didn't belong on the pizza and is just plain dirty.  Who knows what type of bodily fluid was on it. Semen, blood, sweat, puss?? Who knows!?! And two, this could have been a huge choking hazard! Good think my little niece wasn't with us.  The manager came out and was absolutely speechless. He said he'd look into it. We never found out what it really was or how it got there. You can't tell me as an employee, you won't notice that your finger protector went missing?? Especially while working with food??? Not that I'm a person that tries to get stuff for free. I have a job and make money to buy my own things but we were only comped for the contaminated pizza. It was such a horrible and traumatizing experience. They remade the pizza which my husband agreed to. Personally I wouldn't have eaten it.  I want to make sure that this incident is really taken seriously! I want to know that it really was investigated. Are the employees properly trained in food handling??? Is it a disgruntled employee??? Should health and safety or food inspectors be contacted or sent to this location???

Even the manager was bringing out the food walking right by us. We tried to get him to stop, but no go. And instead of anyone having the decency to say hat the kitchen is backed up, your order may take a minute or two longer.  Instead nothing was said to us. We ordered two different salads. But by 1:54 with a thirty minute wait for salad we got up and left. If you know you have a party ahead of time set yourself up for success verses pissing off a valued customer.

I came here for my birthday and decided I'd also try my luck coming during dinner hours. Got here around 7 PM and it was definitely packed. I came with a party of 2, so that definitely helped things along. The wait was only about ~20 minutes, so it definitely wasn't as bad of a wait that I bet other people had to wait for. There's plenty of seating available at this location.  If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned American foods, you've come to the right place! They've got pretty much any sort of food you can think of. They've got salads, pizzas, burgers, fries, ribs, steaks, drinks. The list goes on and on, if you can think of it, BJs probably serves it. If she's working during the time you're there, I highly recommend asking for April. She's kind, patient, funny, and all around awesome! I decided to get a drink to start off my meal, and started with the fried calamari as an appetizer. Because it was pretty busy, I expected the entrees to come a little while after so to have some time to enjoy the appetizer. To my surprise, the entrees came out right away! We got burgers and the steak special. All that came out, you can say, pretty much with the appetizers, so we had a ton of food to eat at the same time! Everything was very flavorful and juicy. Despite how busy it was for dinner time, my food was cooked perfectly, medium rare quality and everything came out in a timely manner. When it came down to dessert, we of course got the pizookies! Since it was my birthday too, we were able to get a mini pizookie on the house! We were able to try and mix and match flavors which is awesome when you love sweets and desserts but can't seem to choose exactly the dessert flavors you want! Service was awesome, especially during the busy hours. April, our server, was awesome! She was especially patient when it came to making the crucial decision of what to have for dessert.

When we arrived, we were told they don't have the reservation on the list. It wasn't a big deal since the wait was only approximately 10 minutes. Second, the waitress did not know the menu very well, she had to match the item on the menu with the price on the tablet to get the order in.  Third, the food was very salty, it tasted like they pour the whole bottle of salt on there.

He was fantastic and was quite personable. He made sure that we had everything we needed/wanted. At the same time he was just an overall cool guy to talk to. He was efficient, which is the main thing I care about when dining. I drank the stout that was only there for a limited time. It was fantastic. What I also like about what this company is trying to do is that they are trying to have different types of whiskeys. They are branching out from the normal, my fiancee got angel's envy in the past and today a whiskey she has had in the past that I forget the name. I have had experiences where the service stunk. We waited due to the server or the food took forever. The drinks also depend on who is making them, so the bartender at the time.

I've tried a variety of their items: burgers, salads, pizookie, fish n chips, deep dish pizza, seafood, steak; they were all excellent! I love/hate that they have so many options, especially if you can't make up your mind about what you want! They truly have enough variety to satisfy any diet, so anyone complaining about that is just being picky. The atmosphere is great: pretty chill, clean, decent noise volume, space between your table and the next one over, and TVs on different stations. It's definitely my go-to place when it comes to grabbing quality lunch or dinner. If you eat here regularly, the rewards program is a bonus. It's always great getting credit towards your bill or a free item (we redeemed a triple chocolate mini pizookie with chocolate ice cream on it and OH. MY. GOD. Delicious and I hate chocolate.) -- if you have enough points. The staff is all right. The host/hostess at the front can sometimes be unenthused, which is weird since it's the first face you typically see when entering the restaurant. The waitstaff is somewhat attentive. I think they could work on watching drinks more. Often, it's a good 10 minutes before they notice an empty cup on the table and then another 5-ish for them to bring a refill.

So I told her, there is no way you can fit 6 ppl on a table for 4. So there are two options for you. So i told her two things. We can wait for a booth or we can eat somewhere else. Her response was, ""Well, it might be awhile for a booth."" I just told you we would wait. Geez! So I told her never mind and that we would eat somewhere else that has common sense and respect. I spoke to the manager and explained all this to him, as he looked at his 4-5 hostesses at the front, standing there doing nothing. He tried to keep us there and he didnt seem happy about what he was hearing from me and apologize. I explained to him that i just wanted to give him the feedback and how he addresses it with his staff, is his job. Unfortunate because i like their food. But we wont be going back for awhile. They were not busy at all. 1/2 the place was empty. So we are here at Jack's, waiting to be seated. But we were greeted with a smile when we walked in and handed a pager and also told the approximate wait time. Just as any restaurant would.

I came here to have lunch with my old coworker who retired so we kept it simple she had breakfast and I myself had a Caesar salad and a ham and cheese melt. Ryan our servicer was really nice I asked for no sauce for this no sauce for that and he accommodated me. The order was perfect but I have to say that the food was pretty much like black bear or IHOP maybe a little bit better than IHOP.  The restaurant was very clean we were seated really fast and since it was Sunday it was actually pretty busy. I have to say that the one thing I find a bit crazy; the menu is literally an Encyclopedia I think they really need to cut down the size of their menu it is way too big so it takes a while to figure out what you want to eat. So on to the food itself the Caesar salad is a Caesar salad but was actually really good and the ham and cheese grilled was not bad however I found it a little bit oily and the French fries were really good. I really appreciate the fact that Ryan came back and fourth to the table asking if we needed anything and always kept our drinks filled so I have to say customer service is definitely top-notch over here. They really do pay a lot of attention to their customers and I appreciate that and they don't leave dirty plates all over the table but clean it up as soon as you're finished. Since we sat there and talked for a while he never came over and disturbed us and made us feel that we had to rush out of there and I really appreciated that per say the four stars!

157,Missy H.,"Fremont, CA",70,16,,1.0,2017-11-18,"This is a long one so bare with me: Previously, I would have given BJ's a 4 star. Their food is very consistent. We've dined in, Door Dashed and picked up to go previously with no big issues. We usually end up waiting about 5-10 minutes for take away orders. And honestly if I hadn't dealt with the manager at every turn in this experience, I would have let this go but the manager couldn't care less so I'm hesitant to go back. Last night, I put in an order at about 4:50PM with a scheduled pick up at 5:30PM. It was a Friday night so I expected them to be busy and they were. When I arrived with my one year old in tow, there was a gentleman in front of me and behind me and we all paid for our food and sat down to wait.  45 minutes later (almost an hour and a half after the order was placed), my one year old was getting tired an hungry so I stepped up to the counter and told the manager who had rung me up that I'd like to cancel my order and get a refund because I was leaving.  Like magic, my order was ready but we were just waiting on my salad. I had been watching the counter and hadn't seen them bring food out in a while, which meant our food had been in the warmer a while and no one was checking it. I was out the door within 5 minutes of trying to get a refund but when I got home, they had forgotten our appetizer.  I called right away and spoke with the same manager - you know, the one who rang me up, the one I told I'd been waiting 45 minutes, the one I asked for a refund, THE ONE WHO PACKED UP MY ORDER WHILE I STOOD THERE. I told him I was the one who had waited 45 minutes and that he forgot our appetizer. He told me he remembered me and that it was still in the warmer. His only offer was to make me a new one so I could come pick it up. What?!  I advised him that I had a small child who was getting ready for bed so that wasn't possible, to which he said ""well you paid for it,"" and I replied ""yes, I did.""  Silence. I sat there gave my husband an eye roll and he said ""what's going on?"" Still silence. Finally the manager said ""well, I could adjust your bill,"" to which I said ""thank you"". A few things bother me about this: 1 - if I were dining in, I would have been served faster than I was with a take away order  2 - Why did the manager panic when I asked for a refund and throw my order together? If losing customers is a concern, keep up on the to go orders and don't make people keep waiting if their food is ready. 3 - Why was the manager so hesitant to refund me for something HE personally forgot to put in my order? 4 - He only addressed half of my complaint because in what universe is it OK to give someone a 40 minute pick up time and make them wait 45 minutes beyond that?

The Server was great he tried a couple time to get it all melted at least until he was worried about the crust underneath getting too dark. I ended up being able to choke down 1 slice and a half of the worst pizza I have ever eaten if it can even be called a pizza and not just a bag of cheese on top of bread.

Anyways, as we were paying she was swearing under her breath and somehow misplaced 24 dollars worth of our money when we all clearly paid. She was claiming that we didn't pay so we tried to count it but she just kept mixing it. Rather than using a calculator of getting help from a coworker, she just tried to mix all the money and count it without combining the checks.
