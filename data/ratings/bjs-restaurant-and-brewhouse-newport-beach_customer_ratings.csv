116,Erik V.,"Covina, CA",98,39,1.0,2.0,2012-01-02,"This was the original BJ's.   The home of the genius that is the Pazookie.  A place that was itself perhaps more flavorful than its pizza, with almost as much character as their excellent beers.  The place I hung out my friends after a day at beach, and the place I had my first date with my wife.   Was...   BJ's is everywhere these days.   No doubt some corporate pirate on vacation stopped in here with the family when his nanny had the week off, had a Pazookie and some good beer, and saw the golden opportunity of mass market food chain exploitation just waiting for a good corporate rape and pillage.   And rape and pillage they did.  Even the original BJ's in Newport was not spared. I haven't been back to original in Newport for a few years now, and so after a day on the water with the family, we couldn't think of a better way to end the day than with a pint and pizza at one of our favorite beach dives.  Now wish I hadn't.  My memories would have been better off.  No longer the charming beachside pizza/brewery hole-in-the-wall it's been remodeled and stripped of any of the character it once had, and replaced with a soulless, corporate- spreadsheet dictated décor that screams, ""We use microwaves!"" with a girlishly guilty squeal.  All highlighted with bullet points in a menu that looks like the addendum to the Cheesecake Factory Menu that includes those few frozen, pre-made items they didn't have room for.     The Pazookies used to be made from scratch.  They took a good 10 minutes, just like when you make cookies at home, and were served with huge scope of good vanilla bean ice cream.   Now they come out in seconds; are pre-made and re-warmed and served with some cheap no-name, imitation fake vanilla ice-cream-like substance that even my kids thought tasted fake.   While the pizza is more or less still the same, it too is now frozen first (at least the dough is, made somewhere else, and costs twice as much.   The stake through the heart though had to be that the ""beer machine"" was broken and they had no beer.  WTF?!  A ""brewery"" that can't properly tap their own kegs.  All they had were Pepsi products.  Freaking Pepsi!  How low can you go.   It was heartbreaking.  It's one thing when a place you love goes under, or just is over and done.  It's another when it's perverted by some cheap corporate model and turned into the Frat House version of Pizza Hut.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=100,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.0480000000000005,3.4400000000000004
114,Bridget K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",137,77,100.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"This is a BJ's Grill (I think that's what it says on the building), so it's not the full menu I've seen at other BJ's. There were no baked potatoes, for example. Now that I think of it, it's been a long time since I've eaten at another BJ's, so maybe they're all like this now. Clearly, I have very little BJ's knowledge, so I'll just move on to what vegan offerings they have. They had a ""light"" menu that had a veggie pasta dish that was vegan-friendly. Just ask to make sure they use oil instead of butter and stuff...you know the drill. I was actually surprised by how good it was. This location obviously gets busy (it's near the Balboa fun center and the pier), so the wait was about 30 minutes for our party of 7 at about 5:30pm on a Friday night in December. The host at the front was really on top of things, though, and we were able to drink a beer in the waiting area.  I guess to me, a three-star review means some place I had a good experience at but wouldn't make a big effort to revisit. That describes this BJ's perfectly.

It's smaller than most BJ's locations and doesn't have everything on their menu but it works.  Since it's smaller, the customer service is more focused. Our drinks were constantly refilled and the waitress checked up on us often. I was also surprised that it was crowded on a Friday night which is kinda rare but then again, it's located on Balboa which is ideal for those that want to escape the crowds. We got the BJ's favorite and the spring rolls. I bypassed the beer selection but it's always decent here. The deep dish was great.

I love how the tomatoes are all roasted from the oven. Although the Newport location does not have a brewery, all the beers are available. While the beers arnt ""mind-blowing"" they are decent.  I know this may sound strange....but they have good ranch dressing. Service is good and friendly... The pizookie is the little cherry on top.

The upstairs tables are nicely tucked away in order to give that semblance of privacy for a private conversation. The service is fantastic and the waiters/waitresses are very respectful. I never felt rushed or hassled by the staff and genuinely appreciated the prompt attention by the servers when called upon.

They were generous with the ice cream, and we ended up with more ice cream than cookie!     To top off the night, the general manager asked us how our meal was, and he was very genuine about it.  That, along with the switch in servers and the delicious meal, made this a 5 star experience.  It looks like most people here complain about the service, but we lucked out and got the best server in the house apparently.  Yay us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=80,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.0280000000000005,3.6400000000000006

Buffalo chicken - I didn't like this one too much, but it wasnt bad. It was literally the flavoring of buffalo wings in pizza form, so you can determine whether or not you want that. Cheeseburger Pizza - As weird as it sounds, this one is my favorite. Like the buffalo chicken, this is literally a cheeseburger in pizza form. I loved it! The Works (i think this is what its called) - came with sausage and pepperoni and what not. - My 2nd fav! its a classic. Cant go wrong with it. If you can't decide on a choice, pick this.

We ordered a small pizza, half meat lovers and half with mushrooms. It came out fast and was made with the thick pizza deep dish crust that BJs is known for. A small pizza is more than enough for two people and they did not go cheap on the toppings. The Meat Lovers pizza was packed with ham, sausage, and pepperoni.  We also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip appetizer. The dip was not as chunky but more watery. It tasted okay with the chips, but could be much better. Service: Service was great!

If you are looking for shots or other liquor they have NO BAR Here.Its literally down the street from the pier and you would think it would have a bar, like the surrounding places but they don't. Their menus also is pretty much cut in half, and doesn't offer like the other BJ's do. YAY when you have picky kids and there's like not so much to chose from.  I always get a Jeremiah Red when I go to BJ's I am not sure what they served but it was not a Jeremiah red. Wasn't even the same color. We were here yesterday, and had the kidos. My oldest ordered a Chicken and Shrimp Cesar salad, and the shrimp was still raw and the chicken was pink..WTF. My youngest ordered the chicken fettuccine plate. He was sick all night and threw up all morning (today). I didn't see what his chicken looked like, but I am assuming that's what it has to be because none of the other kids are sick (they ordered other food). The Birthday boy wanted a Shirley Temple, and again I am not sure what they gave him BUT it wasn't a Shirley Temple. It's not a complex drink. The bathroom was disgustingly gross. All of the toilet paper was sitting on top of the toilet, as if someone was playing tetris with them. The roll holder was just chillin with nothing on them. From the looks of the bathroom it didn't appear to have been cleaned in a LONG TIME.  Its a very small place compared to most of the BJ's I have been too. Was horribly loud. There was a group of 50 somethings who were so loud you literally could not hear the person next to you, or our waitress. They sounded like a bunch of hyenas. I thought I was in Newport not the San Diego Zoo. I would give this place a minus 10 stars.

The size didn't bother me too much but the food on the other hand kind of did.  I ordered the Clamchowder soup in a bread bowl and the first thing that I thought of when I took my first sip was that it was way too salty. It felt like they accidentally dropped the salt container in the big pot of soup and thought we wouldn't notice it... I was kind of disappointed too at the same time because you can't really go wrong with clam chowder... but I guess I did go wrong. I also ordered the large BJ Special pizza with my friends and that on the other hand was a better decision. It had  a lot of toppings especially olives, not sure why it was so drenched in olives in comparison to the other ingredients haha. But nonetheless it was good.

We came back 30 min later to check on our table and they said they called for us, though not actually our cell phone, just yelled out our name. So annoying... why ask for our cell phone # then?!  Told us we would have to wait another 15 minutes... so we said hell no we're not waiting. They ended up seating us in 5 minutes since we disputed. As I was sitting in the indoor waiting area, the manager (I think), short white blond hair lady, came over and said ""I need the chair."" Didn't ask nicely, didn't say please, nada. So freaking rude. So me and the other people sitting along the wall had to all get up.  Service was slow and food took forever to get out. Granted, our waitress was nice.

I go to the BJs at the Block in Orange all the time but I figured since I was in the area, I'd stop here. No full bar, that's fine. I'll have a beer. No big deal. So I order my salad and im extremely excited for it. It takes 30 minutes to hit the table. It was seriously the saddest salad that I've ever seen. The kale was old, the Brussel sprouts weren't really roasted and it just looked sad, probably more sad than I did. My server was no where in sight so I had to bug a different server to grab her. When she finally came I explained that the presentation was throwing me off because I have this salad all the time. She went on to say ""our salads are pre-proportioned and that's what it should look like"" Hmmm... I didn't want to waste my time, 1 she didn't understand what I was saying and 2 if she can't offer good service how can she possibly have knowledge of the food?    The manager then came over and asked how everything was, I told him about my experience with the server and he kindly listened and then asked ""did you save room for a pazooki""  I didn't even finish the salad and how was a pazooki supposed to help the fact that the kale and Brussel sprouts were OLD?

Mostly because it's within walking distance from where we stay in Newport. It took awhile to be acknowledged by the obviously frazzled and busy manager on duty. It was a good reminder for me since I work in retail, that to just slow down and say ""I'll be with you in just a minute"" goes a long way! But she did eventually come over to the hostess stand and our party of 10 lucked out since another 10 top had just left. Our server Edwin did a good job taking care of my big, crazy family! Two favorite moments - his patience with my mom who does not want pineapple and my sister in law who does want pineapple, and why don't we just put pineapple on half the veggie pizza? Second favorite moment was when the three kids were all incessantly and loudly ordering chocolate milks and he was able to ignore them, smartly not getting involved. The pizza here is delicious! You cannot beat their deep dish pizza (except Zachary's in Berkeley) My brothers and Dad and I got the large BJ's favorite that is loaded with MEAT ($24.95). Large thin crust cheese for the kids ($10.25) and the medium veggie pizza for Mom and Sis-in-law ($20.95). Added 3 salads for $3.75 each. My Dad really enjoyed the taster set of beer for $7.95.  We finished off the meal with 4 Pizookies: Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate, Peanut Butter and the seasonal Pumpkin ($6.75 ea).

The outside at night didn't look like much but the real treat was inside. It was my birthday and man the food was so good. I felt drunk leaving and staggering and no I didn't have any alcohol drinks. I ordered the jumbo meatballs I was expecting only 3 meatballs. I ate maybe a dozen and ran out of pasta in my sauce. So I asked our waiter a very nice guy to have the cook boil more noodles. It was perfect since the sauce was so good and the rootbeer wings were excellent. It was something new I love wings and this was a unique flavor I never had. My free dessert was hmmn I don't know what it's called. Piezora ??? Its like ice cream on a cookie I got the salted carmel damn it was good.

It's not a bad place to be. They served my party although two of us ordered food, two of us ordered desserts, and one of us ordered coffee. They get the job done if you're looking for a snack and a place to hang out. Although, I came in around 8 and felt as if they were rushing our group a little. We were the last people there, but they closed at 10.  You can't go wrong with their pizookies (pizza cookies w/ icecream) to satisfy a late night sweet craving or to finish off your meal. Their house-brewed drinks are also very good. Their prices are a little on the expensive side.

We walked in around 1:30 and was seated right away, the waitress was nice and took our order. My friend ordered an alcoholic drink and was not asked to see her ID. We waited about an hour till we realized they were taking way too long for our food. A few minutes later the waitress who took our order came to our table and asked if our manager took our order. This was weird that she asked this because she was the person who took our order. Therefore, I called the manager over to ask if she placed our order and if she did not then cancel it. He walked into the kitchen then walked out and told us, ""I told them to stop making it so do you still want it?"" and I said no and he said, ""are you sure they are starting to make it"" which did not make sense because he just stated that he canceled it.

When the check came I asked our server and she said happy hour is only inside. So, my question is why management would choose to put table tents advertising happy hour on every table outside (There is nothing printed on the table tent that indicates that happy hour is only inside)that are not included in happy hour.

2,Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4325,743,1968.0,4.0,2017-07-07,"After a day of fishing on the pier with a PACK (thanks Patrick) of Cub scouts, our family and another wanted to grab a quick late lunch around 3 pm, and head for home.  Considering parking in Balboa is always a giant pain in the asada, we left the truck in the pier lot and walked to this BJs. We were quickly seated in a booth with a few extra chairs, and given various kids and grown-up menus.  Our server was a young man who proved to be very patient and attentive, even with our kids who missed naps and are generally indecisive anyway. The restaurant is... cramped.  It's a small place anyway, sort of snuck into an existing older building that shares a roof with a touristy ""novelty t-shirts and other assorted crap"" store.  If you blink, you'll miss it.  Still, there are a few flat screens on walls and smallish tables here and there.  No bar, which is outside my experience with other BJses. When our food arrived, my youngest (3) announced he had to go to the bathroom. Of course he did...  so off we wandered through the small restaurant to an even smaller bathroom.  The condition of the restroom betrayed the age of the building.  Clearly, this is not a new facility.  Generally musty and marginally lit, although in fairness, cleaner than as described in other reviews.   Kids all ate their food, and my salad was pretty good for a salad.  Of course, they all filled up on chocolate milks, so I got to eat a few slices of their kids pizzas for one. Bonus.  Good food and good service, even if I felt pretty claustrophobic in the small space. I can't speak to the evening ambiance of this place, largely because I'm not that guy that takes three kids 9 and under to a Newport Beach restaurant on a weekend for dinner.  No sense in spoiling the ending for those young couples on dates planning their futures together.  Besides, have I mentioned parking sucks here? Compared to the BJ's in my native Arcadia, which is spacious, well staffed, and holds truer to the restaurant concept of sports bar, the Newport Beach one doesn't quite hold up.  However, if you're ducking in for a quick bite before sitting on the 405 parking lot, it's fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach,3.92,3.31,3.31,,3.5540000000000003
