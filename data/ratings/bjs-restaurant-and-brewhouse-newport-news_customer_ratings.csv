88,Katrina C.,"Norfolk, VA",397,261,387.0,4.0,2015-08-14,"Oh yea! This place is pretty awesome for being a chain restaurant/brew house. As my colleague would say, it definitely reminded us of Gordon Biersch without the actual brewery in house. Yes, they do serve their own brewed beers on tap, but they don't actually produce it in this location. But as I've stated, it is a chain, primarily from California. So if you're a West-Coaster, you probably already know about this place. The new shopping center in Newport News is a perfect location for this chain. Surrounded with other chain restaurants, so more options for the folks around here. The atmosphere is open and bright with an industrial edge. The bar area has 3 huge flat screen TVs with loads of brightly lit bottles on the wall. There are 3 glass garage doors opposite side of the room with more seating behind. Plus there's a PATIO! Perfect for those nicer days/nights.  On to the real stuff: the FOOD! Since this was a ""dress rehearsal"" their menu was hand selected per table. We had the opportunity to try out their ""Calamari"" for appetizer and boy were they fresh and flaky! Pretty tasty stuff! One thing I would note though, is their presentation of this is a little lacking. Its such a huge rectangular plate for a tiny handful portion and then top that off with two awkwardly placed sauce cups that were just there on the other side. Maybe having it on a smaller plate would actually make it look like you're getting more than what is there. The eyes are the first thing that eats after all. On to the entrees. We opted for the ""Bacon Cheeseburger"" with fries, the ""Deep Dish Ravioli"" (aka lasagna) and their ""Honey Chipotle Salmon"" on a bed of cous cous and asparagus. Everything was super tasty! Out of the 3, my fave was their Salmon. That honey glaze was just scrumptious! Although we were not selected for their dessert, I would definitely recommend what they are apparently known for: the Pizookie! I will be back just for that soon and will update this review then.  Equally as important as the food, their service. Since they are brand new, I wont comment too much on some of their ""newly"" employed servers, but their PRO's (trainers) were fantastic! I love making small talks and sharing a laugh with servers that actually enjoy what they do. It just makes the dinning experience so much better! I don't quite remember their names, but they know who they are (pizookie hookup & orange county gal). You ladies definitely deserve great tips! As I've mentioned, I will be back for more. Maybe try out their happy hour one day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=60,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
111,Catherine H.,"Burlington, Canada",42,42,5.0,4.0,2015-08-15,"Halleluyah!  I think I may have just found my new after-work happy hour location! Newport News - lacking in a huge selection of decent eateries - definitely needed this chain.  Yes, Bjs Brewery may be a chain, but for a ""soft"" opening, they definitely hit the mark with their food and drink selections. First, the soft opening is a fantastic idea! (Explained in a previous review so I won't bore you with the details).  However, tables were offered either a starter or a dessert to share and we were lucky enough to get the dessert - the Salted Caramel Pizookie.  Think freshly baked (huge) salted caramel cookie topped with mini chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream - three of us couldn't even finish the whole thing but it was delightful!  Yes, it was that good I had to talk about it first :) We shared the balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes and crispy fried onion rings - and French's fried onions have nothing on these freshly cut, fried rings of the sweetest onions I've ever tasted.  The perfect crunchy topping to the soft mashed potatoes.  The chicken was juicy and tender with a balsamic sauce that was perfect.  Next we shared the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flat-bread.  I didn't actually realise that it came drizzled in pesto sauce, and I'm a pesto kind of girl, making this thinly crusted flat-bread one of my favourites! We also opted for the roast beef sandwich au jus.  I can't say that roast beef is one of my favourite things to eat, but this sandwich definitely converted me! Also, the idea of dunking my perfectly good sandwich into a pot of beef stock didn't really appeal to me, but despite the messiness, as The Monkees would say...I'm a believer!  This was accompanied by thin, fresh cut chips (aka fries) which is a rarity in today's frozen chip world! 10 out of 10 for the chips, BJs! Happy hour is from 3-6pm with pretty good beer prices and even half price wines on Tuesdays.  So, not really being a beer drinker, you know where you will find me after work on a Tuesday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=100,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
38,David H.,"Hampton, VA",167,142,929.0,4.0,2015-08-19,"I am really impressed with this new restaurant/brewhouse in the Oyster Point area of Newport News. It is always a welcomed site to get a new place in my area and BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has just been added to my regular listings. Located in the ever so changing Oyster Point Area BJ's is one of the first businesses to open this area with PF Chang, Whole Foods and Zoe's Kitchen to name a few that I am starting to see come together.  When you first enter you are welcomed by a warm and inviting staff. There is a full bar to the right that is large and plenty of area to hang out and have some fun in. The atmosphere is open and fun filled with seating well-spaced so that you are not bumping into others, but at the same time you don't feel like the space is wasted as well. The art work and décor of this place is also very refreshing and a little hip at the same time without really going overboard.   I had the deep dish ravioli which was just perfect. Served in a deep dish pan with huge cheese filled ravioli and covered in meat sauce and cheese galore.  I could not finish my meal and had to take the rest home for lunch the next day.  My wife had the fish and chips and she loved the fact that they used shoe-string fries and the portions of fish was just perfect for her as well. The tartar sauce had a wonderful spice that was welcomed change as well. My daughter had the small sweet pig deep dish pizza, but they messed up her order and sent the mini instead. They figured it out while it was baking and notified us that they would still bring out the small which ended up getting packed to go as well.  Everything was well prepared and well-presented and be back many more times to try other things on the menu. I also enjoyed, but didn't partake of the in house brews and will try some next visit. BJ's also offers a very inviting Happy Hour as well along with some Late Night Snack items as well.  If I had to say anything negative was that our server seemed to disappear after bringing our check for a while and didn't give the correct change was going to be part of her tip. Not a show stopper, but it was busy and she was very pleasant so that was just small stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
227,Ralph H.,"Seaford, VA",44,32,1.0,2.0,2015-08-19,Had lunch there yesterday and was not impressed.  The beer selection was good but the food was expensive compared to similar dishes in the area.  Their burger was average and the fries were like potato sticks.  Definitely will not be frequenting this place very often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=220,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
85,Victoria C.,"Seattle, WA",238,165,355.0,4.0,2015-08-20,"My sister and I saw this place while checking out the new shopping center and decided to stop in for dinner on a Wednesday night. We both looked at the menu beforehand and were super excited. The menu's huge, they have almost anything you want. Sandwiches, burgers, pizza (both thin crust and deep dish), other special entrees, and a great selection of lighter/healthier foods even! It was pretty crowded when we got there. But there wasn't a wait for groups of 2!  If you had a larger group, be prepared to wait for a while. They do have a pretty awesome bar. We were seated immediately, so I didn't get a chance to go over there for a drink, maybe next time. The hostess was super nice, and our waitress came and took our drink orders. She was friendly and very helpful. I got the white peach margarita. It took a while to get our drinks, but nothing out of the ordinary for a place that was packed/busy. It was good, they had slices of peaches in mine, although white peaches have such a light peach flavor, it just tasted like a normal margarita but sweeter. I didn't mind it though. It was still delicious. We were both craving steak, so I ordered the House Top Sirloin (medium) with a baked potato and roasted brussels sprouts. The food didn't take as long as I thought it would to come out. The steak wasn't too big, but it was only $14.95, so I'm not complaining. It was good, temperature was spot on, although we both found our steaks to be a little bit dry. The brussels sprouts were cooked so well, I love the flavor of a nicely roasted vegetable. My sister finished everything, no complaints from her. We did do some people watching (who doesn't?) and took note of how awesome the other food looked. The pizza was a decent size, and the shrimp scampi was huge! We decided to order one of their famous pizookies, the Cookies n' Cream, for dessert. It was good, nothing too special about it honestly. I probably could have made it at home if I wanted to. We did finish most of it and enjoyed it. I was pretty full afterwards. It's a little pricey here, but we did order a drink, entree, and dessert. It's one of those higher up chain restaurants you know is going to be pretty good. I'll definitely be back to try one of their own brews and some of their pizza! They didn't run into any ""new restaurant, trying to get a hang of things"" problems which was a huge plus in my book!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=60,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352
213,Matt F.,"Berkley, MA",1,15,2.0,5.0,2015-08-20,I use to go to Bj once a week when I lived in Orlando so when I heard they were finally opened here I was excited. We decided to get take out and it was great.  We got the chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza and it was amazing. There deep dishes are the best pizza in the area. The restaurant looks great and had a ton of beers on tap. Can wait to dine in. This is a must stop if you are in the area,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=180,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516
208,Aiden B.,"Yorktown, VA",51,220,7.0,4.0,2015-08-21,"Large selection of drinks and food, suitable for all tastes.  Very busy, but it's new, so that's to be expected.  That said, don't come here if you're in a hurry, as your meal will take quite some time to be served...  I'll have to come back in a few months once all the hype dies down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=180,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384
89,Cliff H.,"Newport News, VA",38,78,67.0,4.0,2015-08-22,"BJ's is new to the area, so I've been trying to find a comparison to help friends figure out if they'd like it. BJ's is a more advanced version of Chilis. Restauranteurs who own authentic brewpubs must hate the economies of scale version of their business that BJ's propagates. They offer 10 of their own beers, but those are made offsite somewhere in large enough quantities to supply all of their restaurants. That's sort of disingenuous and combined with the faux-warehouse decor, makes BJ's aesthetically feel like they're trying too hard to ride a fad. A few years from now this restaurant might join the other chains trying to play catch-up with the flavor of the month and just come off outdated.  For now, though, BJ's is doing a few things very well. They were slammed on the Friday night we dined there. The hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait and, maybe she got lucky, we were seated exactly 20 minutes after she took our name. Our server was clearly reading from his talking points for the evening (try the egg rolls! they're everyone's favorite!), but was helpful in trying to select items from their large and diverse menu.  Let's talk about all that menu diversity for a sec. BJ's has everything from spring rolls (""Santa Fe Spring Rolls"" because apparently Santa Fe is known for their spring rolls?) to deep dish pizzas to ""loaded"" burgers. Having so many different things on the menu always makes me wonder if that hurts the kitchen's ability to perfect the dishes they do really well or if spreads them too thin. It's probably a sign that they get most of their food from frozen bags that can be dropped in a fryer. I had the Spicy Hawaiian Deep Dish Pizza and my fiend had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza. Both tasted great and came out very quickly. I ordered the ""small"" and she ordered the ""mini,"" but they came out the exact same size. No complaints really but what was the extra couple bucks for if I could've just ordered the mini. I guess I also would've lost a little masculine pride ordering a ""mini."" Pizza should come in one size - ""all."" I want ALL the pizza.  My daughter ordered the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It came with a good lookin' piece of fish. I'm not a big salmon guy, but it looked good enough for me to beg for a bite off her plate.  We finished our meal with the Pizookie Trio. I hated it. The cookies and ice cream were good, but you're never going to get me to say the word ""pizookie."" Stop it with the fake words. This is a great example of what I was getting at in my opening paragraph. BJ's looks and feels cool now, but a few more years of made up words and passing trends and you're left with an expensive Cheddars.  I recommend going, but bring a credit card. Our 3-person dinner came out to $93 after tip AND a 20% discount for paging with their app. Maybe a better comparison for BJ's is Burger & Barley down the road in Jefferson Commons. I'd prefer B&B because of their beer selection ($5 flight!) and more affordable pricing. And when does that Mellow Mushroom open anyway?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=60,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352
190,Mike E.,"Memphis, TN",27,5,,1.0,2015-08-22,"Went there last night. The waitress Lucinda lied about why they didn't have 2 of their beers on tap. Also, she told us they ran out of cheese so they could not make any pizzas. Yet throughout the night our group kept seeing pizzas go by. Final straw was the waitress brought my wife the wrong order which contained gluten items in it when it was supposed to be gluten free. It's going to be a long time before we go back, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=200,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
226,Lisa R.,"Yorktown, VA",21,2,,1.0,2015-08-24,"Opening night was awesome! Been here three nights in the first week with various groups. The second time we waited 30 minutes for soup/salad. My husband had both and could have finished if he hadn't waited for me before I received my salad. The third time, our burger was wrong twice after waiting nearly an hour for food. Also, when our bill came they charged me for the $13 dollar per glass wine versus the $6 that I ordered. They told me that I was wrong on that one. No budging on our bill for wine. Only one burger taken off after half our party ate and left before our order came to the table incorrectly the second time.

168,Jonathan D.,"Hampton, VA",31,19,2.0,3.0,2015-08-25,"My girlfriend suggested this place to me because I like to try different sorts of beer whenever possible.  We were sat immediately as it was just the two of us and they were quite busy. The decor is typical ""brewpub"" and appears larger inside than it does outside, however there isn't a brewery in the building. The beer selection was decent. 50 taps offering a range of their own selections and various others from well-known craft beer companies. They also have a menu that takes some time to get through.  After we were sat, we were greeted by our server, we'll call her S. She took our drink orders, I had the BJ's Harvest Hefeweizen and my significant other had the Strawberry Patch. She seemed to enjoy hers. The hefeweizen was decent. ""S"" seemed very interested in us ordering an appetizer, she came twice, we had decided not to order one, but S came again (a third time) and asked if we decided on one. Then we ordered our entrees (we hadn't decided because the menu is rather busy, so it took one more time for us to order.) I had the fish and chips and she had the Cajun Pasta. As for the portions, they are worth what you pay. 4 pieces of fish and a half plate of fries. And the pasta came in a deep plate. Well sparing intimate details the fish was a bit greasy (it was fried but even so), the fries a little dry but the flavor was excellent. The Cajun Pasta, not so much. My other-half described it as a mixture of Alfredo and marinara and something sweet. She didn't taste any of the blackening spice and barely ate any of it. The service was attentive but felt very rushed. We had only received our food 10 minutes before and had only been in the restaurant for about 40 minutes when ""S"" came by, and asked if everything was good and if she wanted a box for the pasta (first time). We were still working on our food, my date eats at a slow pace. Again, S comes by asks if she wants a box, I'm nearly finished eating at this point and my girlfriend says no thank you, and the waitress moves on again (twice). My plate is finished and the server comes by again and asks if she wants a box and if we want dessert. She says no again to the box (three times) and no dessert. She walks off and says she'll bring the check. We look at each other feeling like she wants to get rid of us. So I pay, and when she brings it back she has a takeaway box in her hand and asks again! (Four times!) So in and out in about an hour (I Wasn't looking for a fast dining experience). Granted, it was busy, but there were several open tables when we left. Might come back for drinks, but the experience left a lot to be desired. Sorry for the long winded review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=160,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
181,Casey B.,"Newport News, VA",0,17,35.0,4.0,2015-08-25,"We decided to try some place new tonight and came up with very mixed feelings about the place. We ordered the calamari which was very delicious. My son ordered the kids sliders which we ordered with the calamari. Both came out in 15 minutes. The beef slider patties were very small and not filling even for a kids meal. His thin cut French fries were very good.  My girlfriend and I ordered the BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza and the North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp.  And then we waited... And waited... And waited...  We waited a very long time for food just to be told it was already given out and that they were remaking it. Then we waited some more, they still convinced us to wait. All the managers had come to our table and apologized. They gave us no excuses because they had none. They were upfront about the situation. They handled everything the way they needed to, we will consider coming back.  Once we got our food, it was very good. Very flavorful dishes.  Our waitress, Crystal was excellent. She tried to keep us a happy as possible and was constantly checking on us. The managers were great. Jerry took care of everything in the right manner and had a great presence.

193,Jesse C.,"Newport News, VA",75,217,19.0,2.0,2015-08-25,"I came here during a promotion that allowed my family to eat for free. We donated money to the cystic fibrosis foundation for what the meal would of cost us. Overall the service was  good. I really liked the hand crafted root beer and orange soda. The food was all very greasy. Yeah, I know.. it's a brewhouse.. however I can typically eat greasy food without having a GI attack. The food seemed very trendy? Think typical pubfare with buzzwords like: no high fructose corn syrup, sriracha, and ""healthy"" spins on stuff. I am confused by what audience BJ is trying to target? It seems almost red robinish but expensive? So if you have a growing family, it may not be the best for your budget? However they have healthier (use this phrase with a grain of salt) pubfare that kids may enjoy... keyword may! BJ's has a very extensive list of beers, however they use their own brand the most. While it was good per my craft beer enthusiast husband... I think he would rather be reaching for stone. I think that they put a lot more effort into their own beer and marketing that than having other craft beers available. That was kind of a disappointment to me.

I was hoping for a good experience at a new place, and I tried BJ's 2 nights in a row to give it a chance. Sadly, I was disappointed both times with the lack of professionalism on the part of the wait staff and the shoddy food. On my first night, I visited the restaurant with my best friend. We were seated immediately at the bar and ordered drinks and mini pizzas. The mojito I got was one of the best I have tasted! We were off to a good start! I noticed that my pizza was taking a while but didn't really care because I was enjoying having the time to visit with my friend. The waitress came by and apologized at one point. She explained that they burnt my pizza to a crisp and that she made them make me a new pizza. When we finally got our food, the pizzas she brought were burnt! I can only imagine imagine how the first pizza looked. Now, I took my husband tonight to try to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Everyone has an off night every once in a while.  After being seated immediately, it took over 10 minutes for any of the servers to acknowledge us. When our waiter finally came, we ordered drinks and an appetizer. My strawberry mojito was amazing but my husband's beer was flat. Our spinach artichoke dip had no taste, and the greasy chips that accompanied it also came plated with chip crumbs, like at the bottom of a bag, and burnt pieces of God only knows what from the fryer. We ordered two entrees after we finished our app and they were both terrible. My husband remarked that his burger was greasy and tasted like chemicals, and my Cajun pasta tasted like Alfredo and marinara mixed together and sprinkled liberally with seasoning salt. Half of the noodles were even stuck together and uncooked. Halfway through our entree, we ordered a second round of drinks. We had been done with our food for 10 minutes before we saw the drinks. When the waiter sensed that we might be a bit upset, he remarked that this was what bothered him about the restaurant. He also told us his boss had assigned him a crazy table that was making his night difficult and he apologized. After he walked away, a waitress came by and yanked our ketchup off of our table without asking if we still needed it. My husband still had a plate of fries and half a burger in front of him. Once she saw his startled face, she grabbed another bottle and put it on our table while rolling her eyes... No apology or anything. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he said a lot of the staff in the brewhouse had no class. Overall, we paid 80 dollars for crappy food and service.

Though all were ordered at the same time, we got them at different points so we couldn't enjoy together; the worst part being that they couldn't recall which glasses were which brew and then got 2 flights completely mixed up.  There is a huge difference between a lager and an IPA but the servers couldn't keep them straight. I had a ""starter"" salad that had watermelon, feta and arugula - delicious - and a flatbread.  We had entree salad, burger and chicken at the table and everyone really enjoyed their meal.  Our waiter (Devon?) was great.  However there were people assisting the waiters with their drinks, etc. and I think that caused more confusion than help.

I requested that the item be adjested in which it was.  Had I not remembered reading the menu and requesting a copy of it to check the ingredients on BOTH occasions, I would have been cheated on what I ordered. We gave them two chances and the service is clearly an issue. Another table made a comment that they were running late and really needed their check because they had been there long enough. And yet, another table waited at least 25 minutes to receive a beverage. They were still waiting on their check when we left with very UNHAPPY faces! If you do not mind poor and very slow service, the food is very good; however, a large part of the dining experience is the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=100,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

Rather than any stuff willing to help show us where to go we got remarks by the staff ""this is not an entrance and or exit""! Well SORRY! How about you keep door closed or put a sign outside telling people what to do rather than acting rude to your first time guest! At the hostess stand we did not have much better luck. We sat in bar area did not get any service for 5 minutes and walked out same way we came in again rudely reminded by the horrible staff that the door opened to parking lot was not an exit??? So glade we did not order anything. Management needs to get a clue and do better job at guest service. Close the side door or put a sign there if you don't want foot traffic from that direction.

The food I've had so far is delicious and there is a large drink menu to satisfy every craving. So I have no qualms with the food or drink.  The problem with this place is that no matter the quality of food, it cannot compensate for the lack of good service. The second time was quite a bit better than the first, however: don't open a restaurant and expect the servers and kitchen staff to just ""work it out"" as they go. Have training days ahead of opening so that they are prepared when the general public comes in. Poor planning, in my opinion.

The menu is huge, focusing primarily on pizza and hamburgers but we were delighted to see quite a few 'weight conscious' items such as the delicious lemon thyme chicken. This dish was excellent, visually appealing, and a good portion size - Excellent! The variety of the menu impressed us as well - not just the same 'ole wings and mozzarella sticks, although there is a version of those.  I think some of the service complaints made by others on this site may be due to growing pains.

She bought my salad and then disappeared into the kitchen. After I finished my salad and my mother was still waiting on her order, she had disappeared into the kitchen. At that point, my curiosity about this ""kitchen"" was piqued. Was there some sort of black hole or other dimension there that food and wait staff disappeared into?

We ordered the sriracha queso, he didn't ask so they put chili in it however that was delicious. The chips though....holy greasy...we asked for non greasy chips his answer was they make them fresh daily and they all look like that. He said he would try and get some non greasy ones and to his credit he tried but they were just as greasy.  Sad because the dip was good, he took it away and said he would take it off the bill.   My husband ordered double deluxe burger and it looked amazing and he said it was very good handmade patties no complaints.   I ordered the deep dish ravioli it was good, I will say if you read the description it mentions sausage and pepperoni, the sausage is like the pork topping on a Pizza Hut pizza and the pepperoni is diced so small you don't notice it.  But I want to be clear it was very good and big portion 4 giant ravioli in there.  If you like cheese this is for you.  Then we ordered trio pizookie dessert salted caramel,cookies and cream, and wht chocolate macadamia.  All good the fist two were really sweet the macadamia was good just not over the top sweet.  All in all a good shared dessert not premade but made to order. All in all service was okay but not impressive.  The appetizer was taken off but they didn't seem to care about fixing it.  The service was slow at times and everyone just have the impression they were there but not happy about it.  The runner that brought the dessert put it down and walked off, not horrible but would a little interaction hurt? Looks like a good place to see a game, kinda noisy and because the patio door was open we had flies circling the table.  My husband told me to add bring a moist towelette because everything will be sticky if you order those sodas. They are delicious but somehow managed to get everywhere, I'm assuming the frosty mugs as they melted contributed to this.   So the rating is mostly based on the food not the service/atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=120,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.668,2.8

Waste of money. Sorry, but this place just can't keep it together. 10-14-16 We arrived 30 minutes after making ""preferred seating"" reservation. When we got to the front, we were told that there was a 45 minute wait. WTF! We waited for over an hour. There were plenty of empty tables around us when we were finally seated. Waited 10 more minutes for a waitress to show up. Water and a beer showed up pretty fast. The appetizer took much longer. And the main courses were quick to follow. Not properly spaced timing. The waitress never came back to check on us. Food was mediocre. Nothing special. We took a dessert to go.

I was here on Wednesday of this week with my friend. We sat outside and the server did not come to our table until 10 min after we had been sat. We finally got our drinks and then ordered our appetizer. We probably waited about 30 minutes and finally got our appetizer and even then our server did not even take our main order of entrees. Finally another server came by and we had to ask for our order to be taken. This server also spilled a drink on my friend. Finally after waiting 20 minutes we got our entrees. Unfortunately my friend's sandwich was made wrong twice after she had told the server how she wanted it modified. She also never got another refill of soda. She ended up not even eating anything. The server asked the manager to talk to her right in front of me and the manager looked at her and kept on walking. It was really rude. My friend did not eat anything and they still charged her for half the appetizer and the drink that got spilled on her! I can't even tell you who our server was because we had 4 different people come by. I have served in my day so I know the pressure that comes with working in the food service industry but I know that you guys have been open well over a month so I don't understand why your servers have not been trained properly to do their jobs. They should have gotten plenty of training to not be this disorganized. I could look around me and see that there are piles of plates and glasses just sitting on the table. There is no excuse for this much chaos considering how many servers were working that day. I could also look and see that the guests around me were also dissatisfied with the service.

Also, took a very long time to get drink refills... and honestly 14.95 for baked ravioli is a bit expensive. For that price, I'd of liked it to have included a small side salad but that was 3.95 extra.  The ravioli was average to less than (on a sliding scale I'd put it just below the middle). Reason was the top was rubbery/chewy.  Bottom ravioli was good. But nothing special. My husband had the baked Ziti.  He said Applebees was better. Also Olive Garden's...   Coffee I enjoyed as well as that delicious garlic knot. But pricey for what you get on some things. Other things on the menu looked good. Root beer glazed wings/ribs.  Also the pizzas looked cool but they are right next door to Mellow Mushroom so...

It was one SMALL open room comparatively but really that's not affecting my review, just not what I was hoping for/expecting that I came to love and appreciate from all the previous locations I've been to. We went inside and there was no hostess to be seen. We waited. waited. waited. waited. A couple staff members looked right at us and kept walking. Some staff members were standing around the bar and just completely ignored us. I should mention we went at 10:30 PM and it was not even slightly crowded. We waited some more. Waited some more and finally after being ignored by all the staff (seriously, not even one person told us to wait that someone would help us in just a second, they made eye contact and just kept walking or kept talking at the bar). Isn't the host/hostess supposed to kinda set the first impression of the place? Non-existent host and being ignored by the very staff that would probably have waited on our table. Nope. We turned around and left. Not sure I'll even try giving this place another go. If they can't handle guests when it's empty, I'd HATE to see how they handle it during peak hours.

Courteous and friendly greeting by the hostess, my wife asked for a booth and we were immediately seated.  The interior has an expected modern look.  The bar looks like it's from outer space (a good thing) with all the fancy lighting. As for the menu, to me it's a bit busy and somewhat disjointed.  I think it could be better organized - that's just me.  In any case the food my wife, my sister-in-law and I ordered was absolutely delicious. My sister-in-law ordered the Baby Back ribs, not aware they were ""Root Beer"" glazed.  One taste and her face lit up light a spotlight. After some encouragement I tried one of the ribs and it was moist, tender and had a taste/flavor I could not put my finger on it.  When I re-looked the menu - ah ha! Root Beer glaze was the mystery.  Very good.  My wife's tacos (1 shrimp, 1 Mahi Mahi) was cooked perfectly and tasty and yummy.  I'm originally from Chicago and unfortunately ordered the 6in Deep Dish BJ's favorite.  I was disappointed.  It was OK, but not up to my expectation - so next visit I'll be trying either a different menu item or a different pizza.  All in all a great eating experience.  It was worth the wait for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=80,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8320000000000003,2.64

I don't think most people even know how good rice can be to begin with so that is me being too idealistic, and not specifically directed toward BJ'S exclusively.   Enough with the rice rant.  BJ's is really good, it's worth it, and I love their wide selection of beer.   I am glad I can visit it out East now instead of only out west.  Who doesn't love good BJ's, right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news?start=120,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.8640000000000003,2.76

As our waitress always inform us it's really a pizza joint but has a little bit of everything on the menu. The Mediterranean deep dish pizza is very good, the guacamole burger is yummy, the asparagus is loaded in salt, it would be better without a chance of high blood pressure. If you're a wing person I would NOT recommend their wings as they are small and very dry. The restaurant brews its own beer and soda. I recommend the Amber beer it taste like a Samuel Adams autumn lager. The Blondie is a good light beer. The rootbeer, black cherry soda is delicious as well. Our service is usually good the waitresses check up on us from time to time and every single time we have been there the manager has stopped by to ask how everything was. The kids menu is also great and they offer crayons and a complimentary appetizer( garlic knot and grapes) to keep the children occupied.

She had hers replaced with a BJ's classic mojito, too easy right. No such luck. So to the beer we went. You just can't mess that up. Our appetizers came out and finally a manager walked past asking us how things were going. I asked him for silverware plates and napkins. Now I'm not a picky person, but when my knife and fork had food crusted to them it's really pushing me to the point of no return lol. He immediately brought me clean silverware and all was well. The moz cheese sticks were great and the chips and sriracha dip also good. I had the roast beef dip, no complaints, good sandwich. She had the BLT salad and it was drenched in dressing lol.

My second experience a young couple walked in right ahead of me with no reservation came in and was told by the very same hostess that it would take 10-15 min. I went up with my reservation and was instantly told 20-25 minutes. I asked why then she told me that wait list does not mean anything and you still have to wait after people who walk in. Another lady whose name I can't remember but was definitely a more senior member came up and I asked her if she can explain the process and she did very professionally and asked the hostess what wait time did she give me; and she lied and said she told me 10-15 minutes. She blatantly lied right in front of me. The more senior person told me it would not take that long and  had me seated in less than 10 minutes.

There was a little bit of a wait, supposedly 30min, but we probably only waited about 15min. Meanwhile, we played some cornhole which was right outside the restaurant: girls vs boys, of course. After we were seated our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away. We got our drinks and our appetizers shortly after and they were delicious. I had a Pink Cadillac that came in a martini glass and it tasted like a pink starbust, no joke. Super delish. For appetizers we ordered the calamari and mozzarella sticks, equally as delicious and cooked perfectly. Enough to share between us 4. My husband and I also ordered a Caesar side salad which was pretty decent. The croutons were crunchy and not stale at all. Also not drowning in dressing. For our meals I got the salmon over couscous which also had a mushroom and tomato sauce. It had a taste different from what I normally order, but was surprisingly really good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the couscous had a lemony taste that balanced out my palette. My husband ordered the shrimp and asparagus penne and he loved it. We were stuffed so we had to take some leftovers home. Lemme tell ya, even after 2 days, my salmon was still good. For dessert, we all shared the pizookie sample trio. Pretty much got all different kinds but my favorite will ALWAYS be the classic chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream. Seriously a must whenever you go to BJs. Credit and appreciation to our server who was always so attentive during the entire course of our meal and had perfect timing for everything. As we ordered our entrees I also ordered the dessert and he knew just when to place the order. Some of the items on the menu can get pretty pricey, but overall it's decent and worth the price. I really love the ambiance of this place. It's a wide open restaurant with a nice bar on one side and high ceilings. The lighting is a little darker, but I didn't mind it.

This was by far the worst experience we have had at any restaurant in a very long time. First off, our waitress would disappear for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. She was awful. Every time we have visited with our kids, they have been given a kids plate with fruit and a piece of bread. Today they were not. Other kids in the restaurant were, so when our waitress comes by with our food, we asked for a side of fruit, which we were then charged for. When we approached her about it, she said that it was supposed to cost that amount, but she would have it removed 'as a favor'.  I ordered the BJ's Brewhouse Burger, which comes on a Parmesan crusted bun. This thing was an absolute salt bomb. I couldn't finish it even after I removed the bun. My French fries were cold and stuck together. Very bland. My daughter ordered the mini corn dogs and they came to us completely burnt. We actually got a rock hard shell of a corn dog with an equally rock hard hot dog on the outside (photo will be posted). We sat and waited for over 15 minutes to ask our waitress for replacement meals and just gave up.  Absolutely will not be returning.

After standing there for a while someone came down from the bar area to greet us and seat us.   We ordered the shrimp  quinoa bowl and the chicken quinoa bowl and lemonade.  Someone from the kitchen brought our meals to the table. He didn't look very happy.  Upon examining the bowls I noticed that our quinoa was brown rice.  I immediately told the waiter and he went to the kitchen. He never came back and no one from the restaurant came to the table to address our concerns. I don't have a problem with brown rice. I eat it all the time at home but I didn't order brown rice. So we ate the meager amount of brown rice and tasteless shrimp and decided that this would be our last visit to BJs.  The waiter seemed to be new at his job so I don't blame him and he received a good tip. quinoa costs three times what you will pay for brown rice but no one offered to adjust the price or even address the substitution.  I don't think BJs will be around much longer if this continues to be the type of service they present to the public.

All different varieties, IPAs, pales, blonds, stouts, reds, you name it. The menu looked good, and I almost got the tacos. The chicken bacon piadia was pretty good. Juicy, not as cheesy as I expected, but good flavor. You could taste the bacon. The ranch was good too. The fries were excellent. I ate all of them. This was a 1100+ calorie meal, however, it did keep me full for a hours. They had some good happy hour deals from 3 to 7 which I would go back to check out. I liked the wide open space of the restaurant, and the décor was neat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news,2.92,2.9,2.9,,2.908

14,Lance H.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,7,4.0,3.0,2018-01-06,"This is our first trip to BJ's. When sat down and looked at the menu, we were pretty excited. It's nice to have a menu where there is so much too choose from you can't pick. That however also has a downside. I ordered the made in house chips and guacamole. When it got to the table it had already started to turn colours on top. My fish tacos came out hard like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. My wife's burger was supposed to be no onion and came out with onion on it. The manager Mark was very nice and addressed the issues with a professional and friendly demeanour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news,3.04,2.96,2.96,,2.9920000000000004

The food and drinks were not that bad but a little rat showed up the near our seat and i freaked out. One of customers wrapped up the rat and put it outside of the restaurant.

6,Destiny C.,"Waynesboro, PA",79,1,,5.0,2018-01-11,"I went to this restaurant this week and it is now my one of my 2 restaurants ever. I researched for 2 hours where in the area they have bison burger and this was the only one that popped up. We went there and it had really good music, wonderful atmosphere, everyone that worked there was friendly. Have to hand it to our server Nick. Was the best server I personally have ever had and when we go there again we will be asking for Nick to be our server.  We had come with a friend from out of state and he had the best time there as well. Whoever the chef was at 8pm on Wednesday I would give appraisal to as well. The burgers were perfect. And for the quality of everything  it was not expensive at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-news,3.12,2.93,2.93,,3.0060000000000002
