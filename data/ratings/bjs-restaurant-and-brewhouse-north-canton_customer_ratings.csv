37,Scott H.,"Navarre, OH",79,81,106.0,5.0,2015-10-06,After trying one of their California  locations we were very excited to see a BJ'S  coming to Canton. Their menu has a ton of variety.

71,Kristin C.,"Massillon, OH",46,1,,4.0,2015-10-11,"My first experience at the newest canton restaurant was stellar!  The food and atmosphere were what you would expect from a brewhouse, (I was very pleased with the extensive menu), but the highlight of our visit was our server, Emily!  What a delightful young lady!  A lot of restaurants in Belden have great menus, drinks, and a wide variety of atmospheres, so what sets one apart for me is service.....and Emily delivered with her attentiveness, bright smile, and positivity!  I am a server myself, so this caliber of service in a new establishment was not lost on me.  I look forward to many more experiences at this great addition to the Strip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton?start=60,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003
97,Jarod S.,"Canal Fulton, OH",6,1,,1.0,2015-10-20,"Being a new restaurant, I was expecting a few hiccups... A few was an understatement. Although the food was good, the service/wait staff needs some serious help. It took 5-10 min for anyone to get a drink order and it went downhill from there. Our table felt like we were inconveniencing the serves as they were short, not polite, and always rushed to leave. We unfortunately had a spill at the table and the server walked by, said ""oh no!"" and kept walking. No cleanup, no help. We had to clean the spill and ask for a rag to wipe up the sticky pop!  After that I asked 3 separate times for silverware and replacement napkins. After waiting 30 min for my salad, our food came out. No salad still. I asked about it and they said oops...I said to not bring it, my food is here now. A manager came over to explain that this would be taken off my bill. (As if an explanation was needed?! I didn't get it so just take it off!)  Also. No apology again. I wouldn't go back or recommend this place until they get their managers and wait staff figured out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton?start=80,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

38,Angie M.,"Uniontown, OH",19,3,,4.0,2015-10-24,"Good food but frustrating dining experience due to seating process. Our party of 4 visited on a Thursday night around 5:15. They have an app which you use for waitlist seating. We checked in on the app at 5:15 which said no wait. Arrived at the hostess desk at 5:20 to be told app not working 30 to 40 minute wait. We waited for 50 minutes and checked our spot in the seating only to be told hostess never actually ""hit the right button to check us in"" We were finally seated by 6:05! Asked to speak to manager but he was apparently to busy!! Overall food is good but in my opinion a bit overpriced. We had burgers, fries and one drink each for a party of 4 this was over $100 with tip. Add that to the frustrating seating and not sure how soon we will return!

While halfway through our pizza, our appetizer finally arrived, extremely late. Then when we were done and our waitress checked back and then we waited 30 minutes for our bill, the waitress was no where to be seen.

64,Allison A.,"Canton, OH",2,35,7.0,3.0,2015-11-10,"My friend and I were excited to see a new restaurant coming into Canton, and when we found out it was at BJ's Brewhouse and were speaking about it with a mutual friend, our mutual friend told us that we would love it. She said they had one in Vegas, and it was one of her favorite places to go, the food was so good, and she was excited, too.  My friend and I have been three times in the last month. The first time we went, I had a burger and she had the baked ziti. Both were quite good, although I would hesitate to say either was the best thing I ever had. The second time we went, we went for dinner. My friend ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, and I, splurging a bit, ordered the half rack of ribs. Now, let me quickly explain something. I am highly allergic to pork. I love it, so upon occasion, I will allow myself a small slice of ham, a piece of pork chop, or some ribs. I know that when I eat the pork, I'm going to pay for it fairly severely later, so it's important that the experience of eating it is worth the agony to come. Unfortunately, it was not. The server had promised me that the ribs were so tender they would fall off the bone. He described a 5-hour marinating process and a slow grilling process that allowed the full flavor of the meat to develop and tenderize. The barbecue sauce they use, a peppery sweet sauce, was really good, but the ribs were overcooked, tough, dry, and overall disappointing. Not worth the money I paid for them, and most certainly not worth the consequences. My friend's salad was presented beautifully, the ingredients were fresh and crisp and tasted wonderful, although the pieces of seared ahi on it were nothing like the picture in the menu. They were about half the size, and mostly hidden under the lettuce.  Yesterday, my friend said she wanted to try it again. Because we had just been there several days before and had had a relatively disappointing experience, I really didn't want to go, but it was close, we could get in immediately, and she was on a schedule. It was late afternoon, past lunch time but before the dinner rush, so we just ordered a pizza and two wedge salads. When we had been there for dinner earlier that week, I had seen someone at a table next to us enjoying a pizza. It looked delicious, a deep pan pizza, so I was amenable to trying it. We added wedge salads at a cost of 3.50 each, but I was disappointed with those as well. The dressing was nice, the lettuce was fresh, but I could get one twice that size at Red Robin for $0.50 less. The pizza itself was hardly warm in the middle, and the dough was not completely cooked through, so we had to send it back to be warmed up and properly cooked. Even after that, or maybe because of that, it wasn't great. They do have a huge menu with many things we haven't yet tried, so I'm willing to go again and try some other things. Maybe this is a place where the huge menu hampers them a bit. Maybe some things are good and some things I need to learn to avoid. Our service has always been good, and we like the modern industrial vibe of the restaurant itself. Just be aware that you are not walking into world-class dining and that your experience, depending on what you order, may vary greatly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton?start=60,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
34,Amanda G.,"Nashville, TN",57,76,56.0,2.0,2015-11-12,"I wish I could give this place more stars. We generally try to avoid the chain restaurants, but this food was actually pretty good. We really enjoyed the burger, and pizzas we got.  Unfortunately, the service was terrible. We ordered a queso appetizer that came out cold... intolerable cold. We asked if they could heat it up, and it still came back less-than warm, but as long as it took to get our waitress's attention we just dealt with it this time. Our drink orders came to us wrong multiple times. My boyfriend asked for fries with his burger, and did not get them. She finally brought them out after we had all finished our entire meals. It was just an incredibly long wait to receive anything we asked for. I don't think we will be back, unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton?start=20,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536
52,K C P.,"Massillon, OH",0,17,,3.0,2015-11-15,"I read Yelp reviews after making plans to visit BJ's for noon lunch today.  I am pleased to say that service was prompt and provided with a smile.  The size of the menu is overwhelming.  Eventually this party of two, women of grandmotherly age, made their selections:  Santa Fe Salad, specially requesting iceberg lettuce only.  The other order, the chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Appraisal:  The salad, a finely chopped mound at least 6 inches high, was served in a bowl.  (Sorry no picture!)   Our server provided a box for the leftovers which overflowed slightly.  No disappointment with quality or quantity!  Enough for two more meals went home. The quinoa bowl was tasty, prepared with a mild spicy rub but was much too salty.  Ordinarily I would have taken leftovers home, but not this time.  If I were to order again, I would make a point of asking for less salt. We were encouraged to take our time through lunch, and each time we thanked our server for her attention, were repeatedly told, ""My pleasure.""   When our bills arrived, I questioned why I was charged for dinner at noon.  ($9.95 v $13.50)  Our server said she thought that was what I wanted. (I believe this item was listed on the Lunch page of the menu -- page 12.)   She did not offer to adjust the price.   Had the manager visited our table during our visit, I would have commented on the saltiness of my dish.  I would also have sought him/her out regarding my bill.  As it was, I didn't need to bring home leftovers, and I will be sure to specify in the future which portion size I am ordering. There are other items on the menu that I was interested in and, for that reason, I am not opposed to visiting again.  But neither am I in any hurry.  There are a number of excellent restaurants in the immediate area of the new BJ's and the issues I had at BJ's have not been a problem elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton?start=40,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

The BJ brew I had was the berry cider and I absolutely loved it.  Very light and refreshing.   We will definitely be back, however, if you go with the intent on drinking and eating, it is quite expensive.   Maybe a once in awhile type place for us.

Unfortunately, this location left a lot to be desired. We ordered an appetizer and beers which were delicious, but took a while to come, but that was nothing compared to our entrees.  The kids' macaroni and cheese came after about 35-40 minutes (still well ahead of our other entrees) and was lukewarm, but served on extremely hot plates.  Next, our server let us know that my burger was the reason for the wait. It wasn't a special order or anything. I've never heard of a burger causing a backup in the kitchen...  My sister and brother-in-law ordered another beer. By this time, the kids were done eating. My brother-in-law's deep dish buffalo pizza came out cold, followed by my sister's flatbread (which she said was really good). About 10 minutes later, their second round of beers came out, and then eventually, my burger.  A manager came by and apologized and took off the price of...wait for it...the children's ice cream sundaes. A whole $3. At this point, we were laughing it off, but really it was quite ridiculous.

17,Mel B.,"Baltimore, MD",38,176,117.0,4.0,2016-03-24,"Visiting friends and fam in OH and we decided to give this place a go. We went on a Saturday night without reservations which was a mistake because this place was hoppin. This was my first time to a BJs and found it hard to believe it was a chain because of the huge draft list and the overwhelmingly large menu. We went to snag some drinks and ended up scoring a table in the bar section (1st come, 1st serve), so I was already a happy camper. Strawberry mojito in my hand (delicious, btw) and a huge menu in front of my face. I really could have gone wild here with all of the beers on tap. I love an extensive beer selection and trying new brews, but for some reason I was feeling the umbrella drinks and so were my compadres. All of the drinks were spectacular and even though I did not have a beer, I SO appreciated the selection. We decided to get a lot of apps and split them between the four of us. We ended up going with the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts, Sriracha Queso Dip, Old Country Tomato Basil tavern cut pizza, and Root Beer Glazed Wings. Here is how I would rank them: #1- Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts- great sauce, cooked perfectly. Wish I could have eaten the whole basket myself! #2- Root Beer Glazed Wings- such an interesting flavor that worked really well on the perfectly fried wings. Even though this was my #2, I would have to say if the table were voting, this would be #1.  #3- Old Country Tomato Basil tavern cut pizza- meh. It was fine. I was expecting it to be a little cheesier or maybe have a little more...sass? #4- Sriracha Queso Dip- honestly, felt like this could have been a micro cheese dip from the grocery store and I could say the same about the chips. Thumbs down.  NOW the star of the meal??? PIZOOKIES! Yes. Oh yes. Give me pizookies or give me death. We did the pick 3 and had the Monkey Bread Pizookie, Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie, and the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. The best was definitely the Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie...oh me oh my...that cookies and cream whipped cream changed my life!  Service was excellent and I liked the vibe a lot.

14,Tracey H.,"Canton, OH",2,10,3.0,4.0,2017-01-05,"We had a delicious dinner here on Sunday afternoon.  Initially, we were concerned about getting a table - because although I could see empty (and uncleared) tables, we were told the wait was 30-40 mins.  I looked around the waiting area, and counted six parties waiting.  That didn't add up.  I asked the hostess about sitting on the bar area, and she indicated it was first come, first served.  We walked around the bar area, and noticed an empty but again uncleared both, and a large dirty table that was actually two 4-tops pushed together.  My dining companions and I pulled the tables apart, stacked the dirty dishes, glasses, and napkins onto one of the tables and took our seats at the now-cleared table.  Dirty looks from everyone waiting in the lobby could be felt.  Hey - you could have cleaned your own table too... All of the above is why there are 4 stars instead of 5.   Once we got the table wiped off, and a server assigned, our visit became much better.  Our server Rose was the highlight of our experience.  She single-handedly saved this review from being a disappointed rant.  She was so friendly, attentive and pleasant that we all commented that any of us would hire her if we ever had a job for her. B.J.'s - please hire dependable busboys, and staff up for the Monday after a holiday weekend.  You've got great food - but if your lobby looks full and we see dirty tables, we're not going to stick around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-canton,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

They bumped us to the head of the line which was still a 30 min wait, which is great considering it was a Saturday night. The revolving door is nice because it keeps it warmer than having the door open constantly while you're waiting, but I kept getting clobbered by people who don't know how to use it. So we finally got seated and ordered. They forgot my mom's drink and offered to take it off the bill. Well, yes, since it never came, please don't make us pay for it.
