91,Reuben R.,"Edmond, OK",3,12,,3.0,2012-01-29,"I have dined at BJs many times and every time it is great. However this one time I went with my friends during lunch. We called ahead to ask if we could order a desert to go and eat it there. The lady said no, so we ordered it togo anyway. When we got there, they hadn't packaged the desert up so we asked if we could just eat it there. She said ""Oh like you asked on the phone? NO (in a smirky attitude)."" We then asked a waiter and he said that would be fine. Then the manager came and gave us crap because we were minors. I called the corporate office and they gave me crap too. BJs is a good restaurant, but over priced. Do not go there without being ready to receive smirky and rude comments. 3 stars for previous experiences, but that is very generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
102,Senushi J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",59,101,194.0,3.0,2012-02-24,"We got together with a big group of friends last night, and I've gotta say it's a great place to get a wide variety of tastes together to watch a Thunder game. Normally, I'd give a place like this 2 stars based on the food because it's just mediocre chain restaurant food (think Applebee's or TGIFridays), but this place gets an extra star for their wide variety of beer and because they have a gluten free menu! I wanted to get something a little healthier [read: lighter in calories] and opted for the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as my entree even though it's listed under ""Appetizers to Share."" They're tasty and even though they're only 272 calories, it filled me up. If you are watching calories, don't be fooled into ordering a salad...some of their salads are over 1500 calories because of all the toppings and dressing! Because my boyfriend has Celiac, we're always happy to see a gluten free menu. He ordered a gluten free pizza, and it was actually very good! The crust was great and the 10"" pizza was satisfying. Everyone kept talking about the Pizookie, which is basically a large chocolate chip cookie baked in a mini deep dish pan until it's slightly crunchy on the outside and ooey-gooey on the inside. It's topped with two scoops of delicious vanilla bean ice cream. Split in half, it's about 850 calories for a portion...but since there was a gluten-free pizookie, we HAD to try it...calories, schmalories. Since I've taste-tested a lot of gluten free deserts and make them a lot at home, I can honestly say that BJ's did a great job on their gluten free pizookie! You can't tell that it's gluten free!! My advice: split an entree because the portions are large, and if you're dying for dessert split a pizookie too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=100,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

70,Steve M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",84,84,3.0,2.0,2012-07-15,"OK, this place really surprised me-----left me speechless which doesn't happen very often. First of all, the service was decent, it took us a while to go through the menu of about 16 pages. My son and I decided on the sirloin steak---we both got a caesar salad which was good and I got the white cheddar mashed potatoes and he got the horseradish white cheddar potatoes. My wife had some pasta dish with chicken which she liked but this review is more about what my son I ordered. They bring our food and on the plate there was the steak and a mound of mashed potaotes. Period. Nothing else. Not even a pat of butter or a smidgen of gravy for the potatoes. No bread. Not even a sprig of parsley for a garnish! Hello-----have you ever of the presentation of a meal? to make matters worse, my steak was undercooked and had to be sent back. After what seemed to be a long time, the steak was brought back cooked the way I ordered it but they didn't even bother to put it on a clean plate. My white cheddar mashed potaoes were nothing special--I couldn't tell if there was any cheddar in it. To be fair, my son liked the horseradish potato version. We decided not to try dessert opting for an ice  cream cone from Braums. Based on this visit don't look for me to sign up for their rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=60,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004
81,David E.,"Edmond, OK",38,12,,5.0,2012-08-08,"This place is a staple in my go-to restaurant list. Like many people, I've dined there many times and my experience has been consistent with every visit. The parking can be a hassle if you're coming in on a busy night. Most people park in the mall parking lot and walk over. Luckily, I've not had to do that.  The waiting area is a bit smaller when you fit a few parties of 3-4 in there with your usual smattering of couples waiting for a table. We typically dine around 5:30-6ish since we get off work early, so the crowd usually isn't that bad. Though when we're on our way out, we have to say ""excuse me"" a few times trying to get out the side door instead of the revolving one.  Service is actually not that bad. There's been a few times when the waiter/waitress' mind was elsewhere or simply un-entertained by us. Though you'll find those people anywhere. Maybe they're not normally like that either. Anyhow, the wait staff is quite friendly and very informative when it comes to questions on the menu.  As for the food, my girlfriend loves their Santa Fe Salad as well as many other items. As for myself, I'm a one dish wonder. I've tried all of their burgers and would recommend any one of them. Though the reason I get the burgers every time isn't because of the way they cook them or prepare them. No, it's the crispy thin fries that come on the side. You can get the larger fries, but if you've tried the crispy thin ones, I don't know why you would. They're perfect. Ask for some ketchup and you can just sit back and enjoy your fries with or without it.  As for their selection of beers, you can't go wrong with a Jeremiah Red. I like to try their featured ""seasonal brew"" when a new one pops up, but I haven't gotten many. They're not bad though. Pumpkin Spice in the fall was a bit....interesting though.  Also, they offer online ordering and pickup of to-go orders, but you have to pay at the restaurant. No online transactions as of yet. The to-go area is usually very accurate on their pickup times as well. I showed up a little before it was time and they had just finished putting my order together. If you don't feel like going in, you can call the number on the sign that is posted in their to-go parking spaces. I used it once in the winter (felt kinda bad for the girl who brought it out to me though) and they're very compliant. Though good luck even getting into the to-go parking on a busy night. Some people just can't park and walk and would rather take those instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

I liked sitting in the bar area because there was a Thunder game going on. The TV had one big screen and 3 smaller ones below so you can keep up with other games. Our waiter was pretty nice and kept up with refills. I ordered a jalepeno burger which I really enjoyed, especially the thin cut fries that came with it! I ordered it well done but once I bit into the burger, I noticed one part of the meat was still pink. I just pulled the pink part off and ate the rest so it wasn't anything to make a big fuss over.

69,Tom F.,"Durham, NC",0,8,1.0,1.0,2012-12-21,"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants to visit when we come to OKC but tonight was one of the worst dining experiences we've had there.  It was on Friday night.  We called in ahead to get on the the list and informed that it wasn't crowded and we could be seated immediately.  We arrived and waited over 30 minutes while people who even came in after us were seated first.  The hostess was rude to us and we talked to the manager who took care of us. It took a long time to get a server, drinks, order taken.  The food was horrible.  The Ahi tuna salad is close to $15.  It was a huge plate of lettuce with maybe an ounce of tuna.  The pizza was good but we had to go get plates ourselves to serve the pizza on.  After the meal was over, our waiter, Kenneth, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, but brought our check.  Once he returned our checks, as soon as we signed them, he came over, reached across all of us to get the receipts and made a point to retrieve his pens and headed back to the wait station to see what we had put on the ticket .  We felt very rushed and was not a pleasant experience, we won't be back, too many other places to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.7560000000000002,3.4400000000000004

Distrust the opinion of anyone who thinks really highly of the pizza. It's not bad, but you should stick your nose up snootily at anyone who tells you that this is the best pizza they've ever had. Your best bet is the Pizookie®. It's about the only thing I get when I go with some friends who are unnaturally obsessed with this place. They will let you split different flavors in one pan (in my personal experience anyway), so that's always useful if you want to try a couple of different things. Red Velvet.

49,Rachel S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",64,400,539.0,3.0,2013-02-09,"Whew, okay. So this experience was a roller-coaster of emotions for me. That phrase is dumb. I like roller-coasters. We went here after an early D&D wrap up, and if I know I'm going out to eat, I try to choose somewhere I haven't been because I have a review problem. Also, it was late enough that there wasn't a plethora of choices. I'm not big on beer but normally places like this have a giant selection of ales and such that they don't have in your average eatery that also happens to have alcohol. So I ordered some sort of cider, and when she looked at my I.D., she said she couldn't serve me because it's expired. Urrrgh. I didn't even really pay attention to my I.D., because it's ONLY an I.D. -not a driver's license. And I've been getting alcohol no problem so it didn't even cross my mind. I wasn't upset with the server by any means, it just kind of... sucked. There are probably more eloquent ways to word that, but that's what encompasses how I felt most. I swear by my pretty floral bonnet... (not looking forward to a tag agency trip).  That was just a little experience side note, nothing to do with my actual rating. Though my emotions started here. For my meal, I ordered the mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice and vegetables. It sounded amazing! When I got it, the rice was slightly undercooked and the taste was... jumbled. It reminded me of a few times when I tried a new rice mix at home and it didn't turn out well. The fish was bland and chewy. I couldn't eat the rest in good conscious. It was just so awful. My boyfriend insisted that I say something, but I just -can't-. I have this weird block that makes me panic up if I feel like I have to send something back or complain. More often than not I suck it up and eat it, or pretend to take it home to eat and still pay for it. It hasn't happened at all often, which is of course a good thing, but it sure is a moment of sheer TERROR for me. Finally, my boyfriend said something and our server was very nice about it and said she'd take it off our ticket and I could get something else. By now, my sympathetic nervous response had kicked in because of the stress I was putting myself through and I wasn't very hungry anymore. I'll admit, I cried a bit. I really do hate doing that. The manager came to our table to make sure everything was alright and apologized about the food and such. I felt like I was going to die. How embarrassing (to me)! But she was most kind and helpful. I chose the spring roll appetizer, though and liked it quite a bit. So my rating started at 2 stars, but after composing myself and analyzing it more closely, it got to 3 stars: I tried my boyfriend's fries that came with his burgers and they were delicious, and he really enjoyed his burger. I did taste my boyfriend's beer, and it was tasty. The spring rolls were yummy.

Apparently he wanted to go... So the manager says that he will cut him, don't worry. As we were waiting for the waiter, who's name I believe started with a K, I noticed food on the table. Call me crazy but that's not clean to me. I asked the waiter if he would wipe it down. He then begins to inspect where I'm pointing and kinda laughs as he says ""ok"" he did clean and dry the table. He took our drink orders and came back with the drinks, threw our straws down and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered an appetizer and he left. I went to grab my napkin and there was a long hair on it. That's disgusting! So my boyfriend asked the waiter who brought out the appetizer for a new set. The waiter PICKS OFF THE HAIR, puts it back where they get the rolled silverware and gets us 2 new ones from another area. Our waiter takes our order and leaves. We examined the silverware and surprise surprise food was on both the fork and on the knife. I was further grossed out so we ate the appetizer by hand. And asked for a new set when the waiter finally returned. He then goes over where the previous waiter had put the dirty one with the hair, and grabs us 2 more which CLEARLY had food on the napkins! Our food arrived and looked fine but we decided we wouldn't be eating there. The waiter finally comes back to ""check on us"" I asked to speak to a manager.

Ahi poke is one of my favorite foods from Hawaii, and friends enjoy teasing me with amazing photos of their simple lunches. I had to make the trip to BJ's to order the closest thing I can find in a restaurant in this landlocked state.   The good news is that the poke is not at all bad, and is probably delicious for those who don't know how much better it could be.  The bad news is that it left me more homesick than ever, and had me wanting to run to the kitchen with Sam Choy's cookbook in one hand and some sesame oil in the other.  Really, the sesame oil would be enough. Maybe I'll bring some with me next time. And some rice, because the tortilla chips simply confused me. We also ordered salads and pizza, and I can see why people return.  The deep dish crust was good and greasy, and held the toppings well. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but was tasty enough that we would order it again.  Side salads were a standard size, but had a few nice twists.  I particularly liked the pear and walnut salad, which had plenty of texture and flavor throughout.   And I had to try the Pizookie, which looks much bigger than it is, but is easily enough to share with someone. Ours was half chocolate chip, half dark chocolate salted caramel. The ice cream did its job by melting all over the cookie, which made it difficult to know how much had been consumed. What started out as ""just a bite"" quickly became ""I'll skip dinner and head to the gym!"" and then it was gone.... Will we return? Maybe. I would not go out of my way to visit, but would pick BJ's over other chain restaurant options if I was in the area. I'll order the ahi poke and then drown my sadness under a pool of molten cookie goodness.

This visit was at 4:30 PM on Wednesday afternoon, which was New Year's Eve.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. The first one that came out was overcooked and we had to send it back, but the second one was cooked well and tasted great.The funny thing about this is our in-laws said that in the past, the calamari had been variable, where on one visit it would be cooked perfect and the next visit, it would be overcooked and have to be sent back. So, when we ordered the calamari, we had even told our waiter that if it's overcooked were sending it back and he still decided to deliver the overcooked one to our table and we immediately send it back. Go figure! So, onto the entrées. My wife ordered the roasted vegetable flatbread pizza, minus goat cheese, to make it vegan - (thanks to the waitress, who is vegan, for the suggestions to my wife on vegan items!). My wife thought this was very good. My father-in-law and I ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage with black olives and mushrooms on both. He thought this was good, I thought it was alright.  My mother-in-law ordered Chipotle honey glazed salmon and she thought it tasted very good And now the coup de grace, one thing that has  always been outstanding on my previous three visits to BJ's, is the chocolate chunk Pizookie. This is a large chocolate chunk cookie served hot, in a cast iron skillet with two scoops of ice cream on top. This is outstanding!

The last time we went here, we ordered the calamari appetizer, the portabello burger, a chicken quinoa dish, and some sort of fancy salad. All of the items were very tasty and creative. From what I could tell, BJ's has an order of calamari every two minutes. They mass-produce the stuff. It baffles me how Gordon Ramsay seems to find every mushy calamari dish in the country on his show, Kitchen Nightmares. It's basically fast food, how do these places supposedly mess up frying calamari? Anyway, I degress. The calamari was not mushy. The presentation has improved greatly since last time I went to BJ's. Everything had that sort of faux-gourmet feel that mid-range restaurants seem to be capitalizing on lately.

We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beers here. While I was disappointed they didn't have a sour or a wheat, everyone else really enjoyed every beer on their flights. The food was pretty good, but it's a chain, so it's pretty much all the same. They try to make stuff that everyone will like, nothing too strong, but that tends to end with lack of originality too. Overall, we would go back again, especially if we can make it to one that sell growlers (Kansas and Oklahoma cannot due to brewing not taking place on site).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=40,4.4,4.4,4.4,3.3760000000000003,4.4

Why would anyone put basically raw celery on a pizza blows my mind! I know shame on me for not reading the description, but I'm not a picky eater and it's never been a problem especially with pizza! I would eat any topping but I guess not celery. It was way to much celery too, I had to tear the pizza apart to not avoid all the celery. Overall without that pizza 3 stars, if I had only ever tried the pizza 2 star it was that bad. Almost forgot to mention the small pizza was around $16. Doubt I will return and if so not for pizza.

One option I was stay away from on the menu is the super salad.  The description on the menu made it sound like it would be the best salad you'll ever have - cue the loud buzzer.  NO!  Maybe it was just mine, but it was nothing more than lettuce that tasted like dirt and quinoa that would stick in your teeth. I actually ordered this salad yesterday when I came to dine there for a business lunch.  Because it tasted so bad, I asked the server for more dressing so I could top it with anything to make it taste better.  The dressing never came.  This server, which was obviously not Drew, never refilled my water and did not bring any dressing for my salad.  I didn't want to ask a second time so I ate it thinking, 'at least it's healthy'.   Besides this one disappointing experience, I would recommend this place for any occasion.  It's great for birthdays, date nights, game nights, girls' night out ... you name it and they'll have the perfect item for the occasion.  (JUST NOT THE SUPER SALAD) Trust me on that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city,4.2,4.2,4.2,3.152,4.2

Many thanks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city,3.48,3.8,3.8,,3.6719999999999997

BJ's is the perfect place to watch a sports game or to catch up with a friend you haven't seen in a long time. And I did both tonight!  I'm always happy with the food I get but tonight specifically, I just ordered dessert. And if you go to BJ's and don't order a pazookie, did you really go to BJ's? You can't beat the deliciousness that ensues when you eat the warm cookie and ice cream. The best.  The service was also top notch and the waitress was on it even though it was super busy! Impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city,3.44,3.81,3.81,,3.6620000000000004
