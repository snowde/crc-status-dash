The place is gorgeous inside though and the bar had plenty of different flavors of top choice liquors to choose from. I just stayed Plain Jane and got a rum and orange during the happy hour which Bacardi drinks are $3 from 12-7 I believe! The drink was pretty strong the first time with the first bartender I had but when ordering a second it was ""Death by Bacardi"" from another one. That's no big deal because I'll just make sure I will request a different bartender next time...  We heard too that there was a happy hour for the appetizers too so we decided to order the Spinach and Artichoke dip.....AMAZING! Kanye couldn't have said it better.... it was so warm and had a lightly crisp top! Wish I thought to take a picture but the ""Death by Bacardi"" had my mind elsewhere.

156,Tara G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",70,166,15.0,2.0,2013-12-17,"I really hate to give BJ's just two stars because I've been here twice and both times the food was great. They have a decent beer selection as well, though some of their in-house brews leave something to be desired. My first time here was at the end of October and everything was great - the food and the friendly, timely service. Unfortunately, when I returned again several days ago there were several issues. There were five of us at our table - one of my friends never got the salad he ordered, or the extra sauce he asked for with his meal (despite asking for it twice). Also, four of us received our food while the fifth person waited a good ten minutes for his burger - and had to ask for it at least twice as well before it ever arrived (in fact, he may have asked for it three times). Getting the checks was another debacle - to say it took forever would be an understatement. The worst part was, some other friends had arrived while I was there, and when I went to sit with them for a beer that was another mess in terms of waiting for drinks and then checks. I do hope that this restaurant gets itself together, because clearly it showed promise in the beginning, but they definitely need to figure out what's going on in terms of their waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-2?start=140,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

224,scott j.,"Tempe, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2014-01-01,"This was my worst restaurant experience as far as I can remember. First we pull up to the place and were excited as I haven't been since I lived in AZ where they had one . Our experience starts with some crackhead looking into the windows of all the cars in the parking lot which we alerted the hostess who seemed concerned however did nothing to make sure that issue didn't escalate . Next issue is with the restaurant being about 25% full and them making us wait 15 minutes to be seated (which was concerning.) We finally get seated and another 20 minutes goes by before we get a waiter to stop at our table . We tell him we have to leave in an HOUR to make sure we catch a flight, the waiter apologized and assured us we would be fine. Just to be safe we ordered food and drinks at the same time. About 15 minutes goes by and we finally get our drinks, another 15 minutes goes by and we begin getting anxious for our 2 hamburgers and 2 pasta dishes. We start complaining amongst our table and overhear 2 tables around us having similar issues and it comes up they too have been waiting over 45 minutes. All of our waiters finally come out and say that the food will be out in ""1 minute "" however opposed to waiting for the food they decide to walk to the table and tell us and then go outside and start basically procrastinating. They come back to the table (foodless) and we ask for the manager which our waiter came back with okay but the food will be right out... Another 3 minutes goes by, we don't get a manager and we don't get any food. At that point we were there for 70 minutes so we all decide to just get up and leave . End of the rant but as long as that incompetent staff is there I will NEVER go back.

Seeing an empty interior and three stars on yelp, we weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised with everything. The food was flavorful, the menu was extensive (something for everyone) and the service was great (especially our server; didn't quite catch her name). What we tried: deep dish buffalo pizza, Moroccan salmon, corn fritters. They had run out of 6 in. deep dish crusts so they gave us the next size up for the same price. The corn fritters were tasty and the salmon came with well seasoned vegetables and cous cous. The latter dishes were on the slightly smaller side side but the pizza made up for it.

It's the first time I come to this location since I moved here and the appearance of the restaurant is just like any other BJ'S. They have a very clear standard for all their restaurants and franchises. What made this experience different was The Server!!!! She was the nicest girl ever, even with my picky sister who takes her damn time to make up her mind and changes it every two seconds.  Needless to say, she didn't like the first plate she got (which I tried and was really good) but the server replaced it for something different no questions asked. We had a really great experience and the waitress was on top of our drinks for refills and constantly checking up on us AND IT WAS BUSY!

I'll give the waitress a mulligan on this one as the slow service was likely due to her having too large a station to cover (so it seemed to us at least).

The avocado egg rolls are easily the best I've ever had--but be warned, they aren't for those who are wishy-washy about avocado. They cram a LOT of it in there, so it's perfect for an avocado lover. If you, like me, truly empathize with that lady in the Subway commercial who drives an avocado car then this is definitely the appetizer for you.  The pizzas are also wonderful- lots of options from crust to toppings, and they're great about making half and half orders for those of us who just can't make a decision.  They also have a huge range of great craft beers in a wide variety of styles. There are so many great options that a flight really is the way to go for a true connoisseur-- and don't be scared to make your own flight! They're happy to let you mix and match. Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the straight up happiness in a pan that is a pizookie. This incredible dessert is just baked still warm delicious cookie goodness topped with fantastic ice cream-- I'm typically not a girl who's big on desserts and I've genuinely considered ordering one of these before my meal.

For dessert the pizookie eas a nice surprise.  Its a warm cookie in a pizza pan topped with ice cream and a Ghirardelli chocolate square.  We had the salt caramel but they offer several variations of it.

We requested to have the tv switched back to our game, pointing out that we had already been there watching it but the server and management was unwilling to help. There was another group who had just come in to watch the same game we were watching and they were turned down as well to have the game shown. This group said they had even called ahead of time to make sure they would be able to watch the game and they were assured that it wouldn't be a problem. This made no sense because the place wasn't even that busy and there were plenty of tv's. We ended up paying our bill for food that we didn't even eat and leaving to go elsewhere, as did the other group.

She then says ""oh not this portion of the patio..."". So was our first server lying? she gets flustered and says she'll get the manager. Now I was on a bit of a time crunch, so I asked to just have my check sorted (it had missing/wrong items) but she refused to take it until the manager had come. After 20 minutes, still no manager, so some members went inside and just settled at the bar. Eventually I got a correct check, and the manager made an appearance for about 30 seconds (after we'd been waiting for over half an hour). Abysmal service and wait times.

About the only thing that went right was we got seated outside per our request - it was far too cold to sit inside. Our waitress was either distracted or inept. She took out drink order and didn't get it exactly right. Then our food arrived and none of us had silverware or napkins. I got a pizza, but had no plate to eat it on. When she came back five minutes later, we asked for those items. It took her another 4-5 minutes to bring us silverware....meanwhile, my pizza is getting cold. My son ordered his burger medium and said it was completely dry from being overlooked. At this point, sending anything back would have prolonged the agony. Refilling water glasses was a real chore too. I seldom provide any reviews, but felt this needed to be said. I ignored the other poor reviews and now wish I hadn't. The weird thing is they weren't all that busy. As far as I could tell, our waitress had two tables - ours (party of three) and one other with a group of 8 or so.

She was very pleasant and well versed on the menu and beer selection. Great job. I opted for the endless soup and salad lunch special. Started with the chili and Caesar...chili was surprisingly excellent. Caesar was very good too. Round 2 I went with the chicken tortilla and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were extremely good. I was totally surprised by the quality of the food for a chain restaurant. Finished off the meal with the wedge and clam chowder. Both solid choices. The soups and salads here are all very good. Service was excellent. Beer selection was way better than expected as well. I had all house brews, but they have many more options. Irish Red was my favorite. Stop in and check them out!

Although we were sat right away at a very comfy booth, it took the server a a few minutes to come over. We assumed she was busy and the only server on so late. We started off with the cream sodas to drink and they were delicious!! The orange cream was outstanding and I could've drank ten of them. For our appetizer we ordered the California Chicken Club flatbread and that was equally amazing!! It was just big enough for the two of us to share. Our server was very prompt for the rest of the evening and she made sure we had our drinks refilled and that we were still doing okay. She was very sweet about letting my husband order off the lunch menu (even though it was about 11:15-11:20 by this time). When our food came out everything was so delicious.

Waters and soda took 10 minutes to come out.  I waited 30 minutes for our beers to come out before I complained to the hostess. 5 minutes later, Our waitress said the bar still hadn't poured our beers. After I complain, you should be grabbing the bartender and forcing them to pour the beers after we've been waiting 35 minutes. The manager offered us 10% off our meal, but that was hardly suitable.  Now to the food. I guess I should have known when the waitress said the restaurant was known for their pizza. But I was in the mood for steak, so I ordered the rib eye. I know rib eyes are supposed to be marbled, but this one was SO fatty and tough. It might have been the worst steak I've ever had. The others at the table had burgers. They were seriously bland and gross. Almost like a middle school cafeteria burger. I can't be sure, but I think they used a frozen patty to make the burger.

131,Zachary M.,"Clarksville, TN",0,16,,2.0,2016-07-04,"We went here for a late dinner - around 945 pm. The website said they were open until midnight, so we thought this would be a good option close to our hotel. When we arrived, the parking lot was not even close to full, so we assumed there would be no wait since the dinner rush would be over. Unfortunately, no one was managing the front desk when we walked in, so it took us almost ten minutes of standing around to find out that we had a 25 minute wait, despite the multitude of empty tables. (I understand that they were probably basing seating off of available servers and not available tables, but it's July 3rd and everyone has the next day off. It seems like that would be planned for.) after being seated, we waited long enough to see our server that one of my table mates started a timer. The timer made it to more than five minutes (plus the wait before starting the timer) before anyone arrived. By that point, we simply gave our waitress our order: unlimited chips and salsa to start, followed by two brisket burgers and a personal pizza with tomato, pineapple, and basil. The wait then began again. When we finally got our drinks, they quickly ran dry as our waitress continually walked past our table. When we did get our chips and salsa, all three drinks were dry and remained so for several minutes until our waitress shouted something about refills at us while walking past - not bothering to stop or to even look at us. When we finally did get those refills, it was only because our meals were done and our waitress was forced to do something with us. When we asked for the refill on the chips and salsa, she told us we didn't get that, but she could see about getting us more chips. She left before any argument could be made. I understand being busy, but our waitress was both busy and incompetent. Because we had spent enough time here at this point, we left money in the check and took off.  I would love to give this review one star, but I like to try to see the positive in reviews, and almost all of our problems were the result of one person. With that in mind, here goes nothing. Positives: 1) The burgers were very good - someone in the back has talent. I would have loved to try the wedge fries, but I didn't even realize they were an option and our waitress didn't ask.  2) The salsa was really quite good. Smoky and not blind nor overly spicy. I want to review a menu and see if it actually did come with free refills or if I was simply delusional. Negatives: 1) Our waitress, if that's not obvious. I wish I remembered her name and could put it here.  2) the pizza was, according to my table mate, lackluster. It had cilantro on it, not basil, and the cheese was not melted.  TL;DR: I hope I got a one-off, but I'm not convinced of that. Tons of potential, but probably not worth it until improvements are made. There are very similar places nearby that do the same thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-2?start=120,3.48,3.15,3.15,2.7920000000000007,3.282

28,Lyndsey R.,"Orlando, FL",16,70,40.0,3.0,2017-08-12,"I've never really had an outstanding experience with this place. First off, when I walked in, the hostess didn't say anything to us and just looked at us walking towards her. Once I got to her, I said hello and I asked if we could have a table for x amount of people. I thought it was weird that I had to ask and she didn't. When we sat, the lady who gave us our menus kind of threw the further ones down as well as the silverware. The next thing that is kind of an annoyance is their menu. Their menu is a mini book. I believe places should not have so many options because it's hard to choose something to eat. Once we received our food, it wasn't all that hot. It was kind of lukewarm. We ran out of all of our drinks and I had to ask for refills. I noticed the table behind us had to ask for refills as well. Overall, the waitress wasn't bad but I felt like the overall experience and the food wasn't worth the money we spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-2?start=20,3.12,3.17,3.17,,3.15

The highlight of the visit was definitely the waiter Michael. He was attentive, nice, and he even spelled the word dessert ( because we have a 3 year old with us).

Their kids plates look like adult plates and both my kids order a pasta that comes with bread knots that are amazing. Their mixed cocktails are also quite good. If we order a pizza , two beers and two kids meals the bill is under 50! Now that's not your healthiest meal but for a Friday treat why not!!

The quality of the food?  Terrible.  Even though the food was wrong we hoped it would still have taste.  Rather it was tantamount to warmed cardboard with a few pieces of meat thrown on it.   Do yourself a favor and find one of the far better alternatives for a meal.  Avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-2,3.16,3.17,3.17,,3.166

32,Nathan K.,"Houston, TX",38,5,,1.0,2017-12-04,"A friend and I decided to get dinner here after a whole day of Disney. It was a Sunday evening and the place wasn't empty, but definitely sparse. We waited on a host to seat us because bar seating after walking all day was definitely not a first choice. Host was nowhere to be found and she eventually showed up 10-15 minutes later. We were seated at a table with a big puddle of water in the middle; she didn't seem to notice so we just mopped it up with napkins and wrote it off as inexperience. Then we waited on our waiter to show up. When he did, we waited another 10 minutes for water even though his section was empty, apart from us. When he did show up, he did manage to take orders effectively. The food came out within a reasonable time, but the steak was basically raw and the tomato soup had separated, leaving puddles of oil/grease interspersed throughout. It wouldn't even stay on the spoon (I should've known better than to have ordered soup at a restaurant). We had to flag the host (who was probably serving as well?) to find our waiter, but when he arrived he offered to exchange the food for something else. At that point I decided to cut my losses and just eat the mozzarella sticks for dinner and cancel the soup (which he did without question). They were ok, pre-frozen, but I expected nothing less. At this point, it's just a funny story, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't pay for another one. Ultimately, this restaurant is just poorly managed - diners beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-2?start=20,3.44,3.28,3.28,,3.3440000000000003
