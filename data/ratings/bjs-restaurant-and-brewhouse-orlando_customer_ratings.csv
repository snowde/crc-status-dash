227,Kimberly B.,"Orlando, FL",22,91,37.0,2.0,2012-01-03,"My husband & I tried to have a nice dinner out to start the new year. This was our first time at this restaurant. It looked busy but we were seated right away.  The table we were seated at had the brightest lights ever.  After we ordered, we asked out server if the lights could be dimmed. It seemed all the other light except for  the lights in our row of tables were dimmer and created a better lighting to eat by not to get a sunburn. We then told the person that brought our food out that we would like the lights dimmed since it hadn't been done yet. When our server stopped by to check on our food, we asked about the lights a third time. He said the manager was trying to figure it out. Eventually we were moved to a different table & ready to try to enjoy our food. I had a salad which was pretty good as salads good. It had chicken fingers & a nice honey mustard dressing.  My husband got the fish & chips.  He thought the fish was greasy & not very good. The beer was the best thing this place seemed to have going.  We were not checked on again for him to comment on the fish or even asked when our plates were cleared if everything was ok. I think we scared the server when we asked about the lights so he tried to avoid us.  Needless to say, not a good first impression. I don't see myself going back. They get two stars because I did get full on my salad otherwise...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=220,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.9520000000000004,3.6400000000000006
259,Amy T.,"Washington D.C., DC",1,12,,4.0,2012-01-06,The food is delicious and the beer is fantastic. Love the potroast (though the last time I got it it was a bit overcooked) but the real winner is the thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer!

234,Rachel O.,"Rockville, MD",85,198,13.0,1.0,2012-01-08,"This is the kind of place where you need to order the most unhealthy thing on the menu for it to be good.  We had been eating out a lot so I went the greener route and chose the Garden Medley Salad with Salmon.  (Crisp romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, fire-roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and our balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Available with grilled chicken, Cajun shrimp, flame-broiled or blackened salmon.)  You'd think that being in Florida this dish is probably so packed full of nutrients and flavor.  It was not good.  The vegetables really tasted like they were canned.  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. My boyfriend opted for the deep dish pizza.  Another gross encounter.  It was so oily and there wasn't much too it.  You know how onion rings have that fried outer layer?  It tasted just like the outer layer. Mom tried a healthy option too and went for the low cal Creole Tilapia (Oven roasted tilapia topped with a tomato olive tapenade and served with rice pilaf, baby greens tossed in our balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes.)  It was under 575 calories and tasted like it was.  My cousin went for this juicy cheeseburger and that actually looked good.  Like I said, go for the fattiest item and you'll probably be safe.  We had their traditional Oreo pizookie for dessert.  It's basically a huge cookie with some Oreo flavors and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Eh I've had better. As if the food wasn't bad enough, our server was so bad it was comical.  He seriously looked annoyed that he had to work.  Like it was a personal offense to him that we came to eat because he surely had better things to do.  We also put my newest little cousin in a highchair and the servers/bus boys kept bringing food and other things over her.  I thought her mom was going to have a heart attack every time someone walked by. The ONLY good thing about this place was getting to see my cousins and their new beautiful addition to the family.  Otherwise, no thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=220,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8840000000000003,3.4800000000000004
168,Dominic B.,"Orlando, FL",46,130,4.0,4.0,2012-01-13,"From the co-creator of The Cheesecake Factory comes BJ's brewhouse.  I've been here about 3 dozen times and it's a sweet spot to catch a game on their massive TV wall.  And massive is the trend here ala the CF.  Portions are very large, and I've yet to order anything that I didn't like.  Their ""mini"" pizzas are so fricken delish, as is their parmesan grilled cheese and tuscan tomato soup combo.  IN FACT fellow Yelpers, I'm heading out in T-30 to have just this and a Friday pitcher of their AWESOME craft beers with my dad, who's also a huge fan (and we are FOODIES of the highest sense).  Their Jeramiah Red Beer is tops if you like IPA style strong ales (and watch out - you'll get wasted on this if you are not careful).  All of their craft beers are great to be honest. Service is ALWAYS spot on - just enough and not too much.  The ambiance is very nice too, with them playing top 100 music in the background.  In fact I find myself saying often ""Wow - I love that song!.""   It's like an upscale TGIF but way better if I had to describe it.  And it's big so you typically don't have to wait for a table (though I always eat at the bar as they have that HUGE TV WALL and the bartenders are always so cool). It's fun, pretty affordable, well laid out, and TASTY.  You won't want to skip the treadmill after this however - good luck ordering anything ""lite"" as it is, like it's sister the Cheesecake Factory, a total calorie whore.  Seriously - 1lb loaded to the nines baked potatoes are on the menu and they're HUGE.  But I'll gladly live down my Jeramiah Red beer buzz running a 5k later tonight in trade for that delish grilled cheese and tomato soup.   YUM",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=180,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.2800000000000002,3.4800000000000004

At one point someone in our party of seven realized that our entire side of the restaurant didn't have any food.  the food tasted ok nothing to write home about or yelp in my case.

The night scene here can be a little noisy because of the openness of the floor plan, but its a nice design as well.  I like how you step down to sit in the dinning area.  the huge screens above the bar area must make watching your favorite games enjoyable.  Additionally, the rolled up garage style doors inside give it a warehouse/cool/eclectic kind of feel.   They also have their own brews which are decent, a little pricey compared to others, but nothing outrageous.  Give them a shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.3120000000000003,3.3600000000000003

BJs Pazookie?  Don't mind if I do! I had never been to BJs, but have always heard good things about their service and food and especially this mystic dessert called the Pazookie.  Since it was a Friday night, BJs was boppin' and there was a short wait.  Once we got to the table though, service was prompt with getting out our drinks and desserts.  Now usually it seems one Pazookie can satiate two or three people who had just finished a nice meal, but this table of seriously disgruntled and hungry girls ordered three.  If you don't know what this Pazookie that I've been yapping about is, let me paint a picture.  Imagine a freshly baked cookie, piping hot and sitting atop is a lovely mound of vanilla bean ice cream gently melting and getting its deliciousness all up in the aforementioned cookie.  Basic, you say?  Boring even?  I thought the same, but the first bite will move you.   The Pazookie was well worth the trip and sweetened our fowl dining night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.152,3.5600000000000005

If you're an indecisive person, it may take you an hour just to settle on something considering the novel-ish size of the menu (yes, novel-ish is a word, I created it just to describe this menu). I have yet to find something I didn't enjoy here.....from their hamburgers to their salads, their pizzas and pastas, and even their mac n cheese.....all winners in my book. On a recent visit I found myself sitting at the bar and deep into a convo about beer with the bartender, John. I was surprised at how knowledgeable and passionate he was about beer, something I wasn't expecting at a chain. He gave me some recommendations after I explain what I typically drink and he was spot on. FUN FACT: They have half priced apps and pizza during any football game at bar area which has booths, high tops, and bar seating. GOOD FOR GROUPS: A few months back a friend had a birthday dinner here and our one waiter handled the 12 of us without issue. He was slightly pushy when it came to the drinks but that is somewhat to be expected.   BJ'S, IF YOU""RE READING: Bring back that opened faced meatloaf sandwich!!!!

When I dined with my colleagues, they ordered a flat bread and a soup, respectively.  Both were good but unremarkable.  They enjoyed their meals but did not rave about the great experience that they were having.  Perhaps that is the nature of meals with colleagues but I found it telling.

I haven't been in years and I forgot how massive the restaurant is. It wasn't packed so we got a booth immediately with no problems.  Our waiter was very friendly. He told us they brewed their own beers there and also offered up samples of ciders that I was on the fence about.  I ended up ordering the southern fried chicken which came with white cheddar mashed potatoes and a corn/veggie succotash. It was actually really good. I loved that it was a boneless chicken so no bones to deal with. One friend ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and her only complaint was that she requested that the sun dried tomatoes be taken off her dish but they didn't do so she had to pick them off.   Another friend ordered a mini pizza (free with purchase of a drink and when checking in on Foursquare) and a side salad and seemed to be happy with.  Our server did push the BJ's rewards card(completely free) which allows you to earn rewards with every visit . He did mention that one of the perks of the card is that you can preorder your meal before even getting to the restaurant so that when you get to the restaurant the server will immediately come out with your meal! Definitely a plus if you're dining on limited time!

My only complaint about the dish itself was the rice. It was as if they tossed the rice in a oil/butter pan prior to putting it on a plate. At first I thought it may be the sauce, but it didn't seem so. The combination of shrimp, chicken, and sausage was appreciated to this cajun/creole fan. I got to sample the House Sirloin that my company had, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Very tender and nicely seasoned. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were also a delight. They weren't extremely cheesy, which was a plus to me. In the end, I would definitely come here again. Our server was as sweet as the lady at the front. He was a true gentleman. It is a little pricy (steak entree: $13.50 | jambalaya: $16.50), but worth it when you have good service and atmosphere... Speaking of atmosphere, it is comfortably lit in there. The eclectic, industrial feel to the decor was super pleasing to the eye and they have a variety of televisions for sports fans to enjoy.

249,Danyelle A.,"Orlando, FL",2,19,24.0,1.0,2014-07-10,"The 12 of us decided to go here for my brother's birthday, but the service and management was a complete disaster. I started off by giving them the benefit of the doubt because the waitress was training someone else, but the consistent inaccuracies and the comments that not only came from the servers, but the manager, appalled me! We have been to BJ's before and the food and drinks have always been good. I honestly can tell you that this was one of the worst service experiences of my life.  Firstly, they brought out waters and left them on the tray at another table, so they could take another order. After 10 minutes, we had to get up and grab our own drinks. Then, we ordered appetizers. After about 40-50 minutes, our main dishes started coming out with the appetizers. When we said we no longer needed the appetizers, the waitress told us it was the trainers fault because she ran them in, and it could have been a computer error.  About 7 of the 10 meals were incorrect, but we were so hungry at this point that we did not complain. That is, until the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad came out as regular lettuce with no Kale or Brussel sprouts. My friend nicely told the server about her salad and they brought out about 10 brussel sprouts to pour into her lettuce.  At this point, we were there for about 2 hours with no drinks, no appetizers, waitresses blaming the other person, our meals were wrong, the bathroom trash cans were overflowing, and the servers were standing around talking more than serving!  We decided to call a manager over.  My friend explained the situation and about her kale salad.  The manager actually had the nerve to say, "" there is not much kale in that salad anyways.""  He basically looked unconcerned and was shaking his head as if he didn't hear a word we were saying. It took another 15 minutes to get our checks because the split bills were all mixed up and incorrect.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed with the service and how the management reacted!  I have always had good food at BJ's, so that is where my 1 whole star comes from...  and I can honestly say I will not go back for a very long time or at least until there is new management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=240,3.32,3.4,3.4,2.724,3.3680000000000003

I opted for the Chicken Mediterranean Tacos which were served on pita bread. The dish was refreshingly flavorful. For an appetizer I ordered the avocado egg rolls, which are superb. I have this love affair with avocado and anybody who does will absolutely love their rolls. My daughter ordered the Jalapeño burger which was huge and apparently delicious.

I've been going to this chain since I was a kid in LA, and later in Phoenix and always enjoyed it. In Florida I have been unusually unhappy with the food and/or the service. Tonights issue was the food. Our server was great! First off, we were seated immediately and we got our drinks in no time. Made it just under the deadline for half-price appetizers, so we went with Carnitas Fries and Spinach Artichoke Dip. The portions were so huge we didn't even bother getting anything else to eat.  The chips for the dip were greasy and the dip had a weird texture from the cream cheese used that wasn't creamy, but more chalky. There was a lack of flavor and of spinach and artichokes so it was just mediocre. The fries however had a pretty good green chile and cheese that was nice, but the carnitas were darned good. Not a bad dish, and with the half off deal it was really a great price.  The one constant for me here is always the micro-brewed root beer. It's full of deep flavor and has this aftertaste that my wife finds off-putting but that I just love. It stays on my palate for a moment with an earthy, sort of licorice flavor that I just really love.

Tonight we tried the Smores pizookie and it has scorched gooey marshmallows on it...so luscious! I suppose one very hungry person could eat a whole one, but it's nice for two people to share it since it's a lot of dessert.

The beers that are exclusive to their restaurant are delicious.  We chose to leave and eat somewhere else for a few reasons. The bar had a horrible stench to it. I'm guessing it was because I was sitting by the taps and maybe it was the drain? I just couldn't think about eating my dinner and smelling that horrible smell. The 2nd thing that bothered me was that the manager was sitting at the bar next to me working on the staff schedule or something on a laptop.  These things won't deter me from never coming back. Their menu did look delicious and I did love the beer.

Opting for some BJ`s brews and my DW the microbrew cream (excellent btw) soda, we realized our waitress,a brunette,while nice was seriously overwhelmed by 2 group tables and whatever booths she had to share with the other (blond) waitress.In the old days,one would feel bad for an overworked waitress,however,in the `chain days`, these 2 waitresses had 2 asst waiters bussing and serving the meals for them. So,it was amazing to me that we (thankfully) ordered our apps w/drinks and receievd them.We advised server that we would be ordering `food` as well. She disappeared. Only when prompted by the asst bussers did she return to fill our empty glasses and take the balance of our order. Even after ordering,she took long to get our rounds. Food quality good,service by this young woman was awful. PS-the mozz sticks were some of the BEST we ever had. --------- Roll fwd to giving this place another shot a few days later: While it was only 2pm,usually a dead time in dining,there were people at the bar and dining.. We like not to be the only ones.  We caught some great lunch specials and food quality,and Bev quality good to vg. What made the day was our cutie server Joann.She was very personable, quick w/refill and pleasant to speak with.We are not locals,but if we were we would go just to see her. We try to hit up BJs in our frequent travels,as we do not have them home. We appreciate the food quality is usually way better than `normal` chains and the brews.

This was a terrible idea on a Saturday night because the traffic coming off I-4 to I Drive was crazy. Considering that we were in prime tourist land, I shouldn't have been as surprised as I was by how packed the restaurant was at 9pm. My boyfriend is from California and has been to the original BJ's but it was my first time so we had to get the classic dishes that BJ's is known for: deep dish pizza and a pizookie. I also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. Service was good although our waitress didn't look as though she enjoyed her job very much. The food came out pretty quickly. I thought the mushrooms were okay but not my favorite. I really just need to stop ordering stuffed mushrooms in general because the menu description is always more appealing to me than the actual dish. On the other hand I wasn't that excited about the pizza initially and it was fantastic. We had the BJ's Favorite and it was loaded with toppings. I was pleasantly surprised that the crust was quite light for being a deep dish. We ordered a small which is 6 slices and were full after 2 each. At that point I didn't really have much room for dessert but we still got a pizookie anyway because I couldn't leave without trying it. I thought we'd end up taking some home but OMG it was so delicious. One bite and I was hooked. We had the cookies 'n' cream and it tasted just like a gourmet Oreo.

One burger had an egg on top and it was brought out with the yolk cooked all the way through and the whites were brown and crispy. We were not asked if we would like to see a manager. No manager came to ask us about or apologize for this experience.  Once the waitress dropped out check it has now been 15 minutes and she has yet to come back to collect the payment.

The burger came with pesto and a special sauce that may have been sour cream based as well as a portobello mushroom that was grilled with grilled onions and a slice of cheese melted on top. It is a mouthful, and tastes very good. BJs fried are especially good, crispy and salty and seem to have been dipped in a batter before frying. They remind me a little of Belgium fries.

Which there was no need for since it was only 2:25 pm and the restaurant had no more than 20  tables full. It amazes me that the fry cook thought that it was a good idea to fry French fries in the same oil as churros, while that would have been fine if frying sweet potato fries to add to the sweetness of the sweet potatoe fries it was not a pleasant taste for regular fries. As a former restaurant manager and secret shopper I observed many issues during our time in the restaurant which was mostly unhappy patrons complaining of food incorrect in some way or the food coming out cold. I also observed a drink runner putting her face very close to a beer to sniff it  for some unknown reason as she was on the way to deliver it to a guest. I think it's time to clean house.

If you download they app you can claim a mini pizooike. Byron was our server and was fantastic! I had the mediterranean chicken tacos and a strawberry mojito. Those tacos were full of flavor and on what seemed to be a pita instead of a floor tortilla or hard shell. Wasnt expecting that at all, but it was genius. I absolutely loved them. There's were a total of two and were filling. The drink was made with love because I definitely tasted the alcohol. NOT COMPLAINING. Lastly, the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. It's a warm baked chocolate chip cookie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's a MUST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando,3.68,3.48,3.456,,3.5600000000000005

100,Massoud M.,"Orlando, FL",18,7,,1.0,2017-11-02,"brew house with no brews and no available GM to listen to the guest input!!! I went there last night with a group of 9, they did not have the beers that one of my colleague was ordering three time!!! Their excuse was that Pumpkin Ale was too popular and they are sold out, for two other unavailable beers, they said their hydrogen gas to pour them has not been working and have dispatched a technician and should get there in 5 hours to fix it( around 11PM!!??). we were the only table in the dinning room at 5:30PM but were not attended to at all. GM was ""too busy doing something in the back"" and could not talk to us!!!!

11,Debbie F.,"Orange Park, FL",170,394,1532.0,3.0,2017-11-22,On a whim we choose BJ's and I had not eaten at one before. The menu was extensive with so many choices. Everything to percentage out at about $15.00. I was not real hungry at the time and just wanted a small meal with a salad. Salads are a upcharge with a entrée so  I was heading toward $20.00 for my meal that I really didn't want. I ended up with soup and salad adding a side of grilled chicken. It was perfect combo for me. My husband just had to have MEAT so he ordered the special Prime Rib dinner for $29.00. It looked plentiful but he had no leftovers except the dessert which we shared with our table. The restaurant looks like a elegant upscale sports bar. Their were several large parties going on with large tables so this says how big the place is. My overall was it fits everyone's appetite but this would not be my first choice for me. I may need to come back when they run some specials and try again soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando,3.72,3.48,3.444,,3.5760000000000005

6,Val D.,"Orlando, FL",178,61,145.0,3.0,2017-12-16,"Ordered the Santa Fe Salad, DO NOT ORDER THIS. Was very displeased. Overly dressed in their ""southwest dressing"". The dressing was not good to start with. And the chicken was dry.  My kids had the pepperoni flat bread, NOT life changing. And certainly did not taste good either. Also ordered the grilled cheese and it tasted funky. The butter they used to pan fry the bread had a weird after taste to it.  The ONLY good item they got right was the fries. Crunchy.  I will not be returning. Quality of food is poor and the prices are beyond what they reflect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando,3.68,3.5,3.44,,3.5720000000000005
3,Heather C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",312,401,149.0,3.0,2018-01-03,"Okay.... the menu is HUGE.   I finally settled on a salad that came out looking like an art deco masterpiece.  There were dried onions balanced high on top of a huge heaping pile of salad and chicken and it reminded me of JENGA.   Carefully removing the ""art project"" I was delighted to take the first bite of this delicious salad with chicken. (It was the Santa Fe BTW)   Super yummy and while we were sitting waiting for our order to arrive, momma said we should download the app so that we could receive a cookie and ice cream yummy dessert for free.  YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAS.

2,Amber F.,"Orlando, FL",49,46,47.0,3.0,2018-01-05,"Met part of my bridal party here for dinner before dress shopping at David's Bridal, which is super close. Our appointment was at 7:30, so I made us a reservation at BJ's for 6 thinking that should be plenty of time. When our waitress first came up, I was excited because she was pleasant and seemed on top of it. Some of our party was a little late, but only about 15 minutes.  Three of the party ordered salads, and they came out about 20 minutes before any of the other food, which started trickling out about 7:05. I had the avocado egg rolls as my main course and a side of fries. My food was just ok... nothing to rave about.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress assigned us numbers based on who was paying together. I thought it was a great idea and thought it would make the check process go smoothly. I was wrong. There were 9 of us total (6 different checks) and three of the checks were all messed up. We didn't get our checks until about 7:20 (even though I made it a point to ask for them once the salads came out). Overall, I was pretty disappointed and it'll be awhile before I go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando,3.6,3.5,3.432,,3.5400000000000005
1,Melinda P.,"Orlando, FL",44,122,337.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"A group of us met up here before hitting up David's Bridal to go dress shopping for one of my besties. I was looking for a place that had vegan options and BJ's has several plus of course items for everyone else in the party. When we first got there, all seemed well. The server was friendly and was checking on us regularly. However around halfway through the meal, this changed. She suddenly became unfriendly, seemed to have an attitude, and service was super slow. We were anxious because we were trying to make the dress appointment. We sat down just after 6 and the bride had to leave before we were all cashed out to get to the appointment at 7:30. We were a larger party, but I just felt like this was excessive.  As far as the food it was pretty good. The lentil soup I ordered was just okay. However, the portobello and asparagus salad was awesome! It had such a great flavor. I'd order that again for sure. I just don't think I'd return to this location since the service was spotty in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando,3.52,3.48,3.424,,3.4960000000000004
