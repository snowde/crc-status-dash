135,Matt A.,"Casselberry, FL",0,7,2.0,5.0,2014-08-09,Full disclosure most of our food was free due to training opening. - we walked in and manages to get seated even though their seating was reservation only for the soft training opening.  Food was amazing we tried the chicken balsamic and the prime rib dip as well as some of their craft beers unique to the company all the food was amazing even though cooks and wait staff were training everything was delicious and it was a fantastic experience I highly recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=60,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006
106,Kristina K.,"Orlando, FL",0,25,,5.0,2014-08-12,"We went on opening night. We used their Android app to book priority seating.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately,  and a pair of servers quickly took our drink order.  My handcrafted root beer was delicious.   I ordered the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich and my roommate had the Southern Fried Chicken.  Both were very tasty.  A trio of Pizookies were the perfect finish.  Several different people checked in throughout our meal to make sure we were enjoying it.  When we left, at least three different people thanked us and wished us a great night.  A seamless opening.  We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=120,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
121,Barbara P.,"Orlando, FL",15,30,,2.0,2014-08-15,"This new restaurant has no contact info, store email or website other than a location site thus I cannot get info to a Manager. I visited (with a friend) the new Oviedo FL location last afternoon,what a disappointment. 8-14-14 Server Amanda (she was only good thing about this place) Table 316 0326a @ 3:35 p.m. I had been to the one in North Dallas (close to Hwy 35 going to DFW) and was really good. This Oviedo location was poor at best. Fries were cold, limpy, burger was so soggy with butter and grease I ate only one side and 1/2, avacado rolls were so greasy I had to blot each piece at least 3 X's to remove grease. We told waitress and she said she was sorry.  Not a good way to start a new restaurant. Just don't go....there are a lot of great restaurants out there now.

115,Rachel D.,"Oviedo, FL",103,2,14.0,2.0,2014-08-26,"I was excited to go to a new restaurant in Oviedo and was far from impressed.  Our service was awesome however the food was not impressive, to say the least.  Granted, we did order mostly appetizers.  We had calamari which was overcooked and had no seasoning. Wings that were mushy and not crispy at all. And, the pepperoni pizza dip which lacked taste. I really did want to enjoy it unfortunately that wasn't the scenario this time. I did enjoy drinking some of their in-house brews however my friend had a skinny Mojito and did not like it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=120,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

122,Michelle S.,"Geneva, FL",2,9,,5.0,2014-09-04,"Had lunch here today. I had the unlimited soup and salad which consisted of my choice of house, caesar, wedge or tomato mozzarella salad (caprese) and my choice of soup from tomato bisque, chicken tortilla, clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. I should mention you can switch out any and all at any time. I had a house salad and then the caprese which were both wonderful. I then tried all the soups except for the clam chowder. They were phenomenal but I will say the tomato bisque was my favorite. They served the chicken tortilla with the tortilla chips, avocado and cheese in the bowl and then poured the soup over it. The waitress explained that keeps the chips and avocado from getting soggy. My friend had the avocado egg rolls and requested no cilantro. The chef sent the waitress out to explain there would be some cooked inside however it would not be that strong because he would leave the garnish off and them asked if that was ok or if she would prefer to change her order. She had them and said they were very good.  I have been here twice now and both times the service has been exceptional.  I had appetizers on the first visit a week after they opened and the mushrooms and wings were out of this world. The flatbread pizza and corn fritter type things were also very good and a dining companion said the black & bleu burger was great.

72,Paul P.,"Oviedo, FL",5,44,33.0,2.0,2014-09-06,"Won't be hurring back here anytime soon. So call to put our name on the priority seating list. The girl takes my name and says approx 15-20 min wait time but we give your table priority when you arrive. We arrive a little more than 15 min after calling and check in. We check in and inform the hostess of our priority seating. The hostess say about 20 min wait... um OK. people behind us come in and did not have priority seating 2 in their party 2 in my party after almost 30 min waiting guess who got seated first? They did! I went to the hostess and asked what the deal was and she said oh um um I just texted you? Well I don't have any texts... well she says you'll probably get one soon but I'll seat you now.  Gee thanks glad I came up to complain. Btw we are going on 18 hours now and still no text message. So priority seating is a joke.  We get seated, ambience is cool but if your seated in the center row of 2 person booths there is a chin hight wall between you and the party on the other side  it's a bit weird cause your 12"" away for the other persons head and facing each other so you can't help but hear their whole conversation and them yours.  Waitress arrives and was rather rude and totally rushed us. She asked if we wanted to put in an appetizer and my wife's says ummm honey what do you think about this one and before she finishes the waitress says well you all think about it I'll be back... really???? Oh sorry to take up 45seconds of your time. She comes back and takes our order wife's asked her what's her opinion between two different dishes she was looking at and the waitress says oh well their both good which one do you want. Once again really??? Thanks for the help. She did all of a sudden get very nice and polite when she dropped the check off...  We ordered the California burger, with the tomato and mozzarella salad and the bison burger. Both were fair nothing to write home about but not bad either a little skimpy of the meat in my opinion.  The Salad was very good but also very small seemed like about half what you would get elsewhere.   Anyway fair food, rude wait staff, and incompetent hostesses does not make me want to come running back let alone to wait 30+ minutes to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=80,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
59,Jeff K.,"Orlando, FL",520,754,862.0,3.0,2014-09-11,"First, let me say that I like the app that you can download. It's cool - you can use it to put yourself on a waiting list, place an order before you arrive, pay the check from your table if you don't want to wait for your check, and give the waitress your reward program code without needing to carry around a card. There needs to be more though.  The beer isn't bad. The bison burger, without warning, was served with slaw instead of fries like the rest of the burgers. The slaw was okay, but I was looking forward to the fries! Especially after looking at the bison burger, which was really pretty small. After I ate it, and the slaw, I split a side of fries with my wife because I was still hungry.  Overall, not a great value for money. I'll come back to try something different, but if I were you I'd skip the bison burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=40,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

99,Erika T.,"Casselberry, FL",89,74,,1.0,2014-09-26,"Ok, so I really hate to give this awful review of a restaurant that I TRULY love going to but I think it is appropriate! My wonderful school that I work for set up a very nice little happy hour for us at the new BJ's in Oviedo. The hospitality group paid for appetizers and then if you wanted drinks, other food, etc. then you were ordering that and paying for that part. Some got there around 3:45 and some arrived up to about 4:30. Everyone ordered drinks and more appetizers because they did have a 50% off appetizers until 6:00 and some people even ordered food to go. Around 6:00 I asked my server if she could please bring me my tab and she said ok. Around 6:15, still no tab in my hand, their lovely manager proceeds to come to our table to tell us that we had went OVER our 2 hour limit and that his ""other"" customers were getting aggitated and they needed us to wrap it up, get our tabs and basically hit the highway! Mmmm, excuse me? What? I don't think I heard you right!! I have NEVER been asked to ""hurry up"" at a restaurant because we were taking too long. Then to make it even better the said manager continued to STARE us down every 30 seconds or so. Just looking to make sure we were getting the hell out I suppose! The waitress finally brought us our tab around 6:35 and then took about another 10-15 mins to run all the tabs and bring us our bills. I was and still am appalled at how rude a manager of a very new establishment choose to treat his customers. And, I can assure you that I was actually looking forward to going there with my family, but that is NOT going to happen now! I will be choosing other dining establishments in the area that actually appreciate the fact that you have 25 people spending quite a bit of money at your restaurant over this place! Unbelievable!  Me and 2 other ladies go to the other manager on duty to tell him about our experience and he then says that they do try to have a 2 hour limit for big parties! Really, because that was never mentioned when our hospitality coordinator called to reserve 2 tables for us. Highly offended that ""our"" money wasn't good enough for this place! Sorry BJ's, but you screwed up! If you expect to have repeat customers and actually stay in business perhaps your managers need a little 101 on how to treat customers! Never again! And, I forgot to mention that as the manager is standing there telling our 2 tables that we needed to leave, several people at my table had just received a flight of sample beers and other drinks that they had ordered! Uggh! Disgusted!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=100,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001

The food was pretty good, although my Broiled Shrimp Tacos had a way too much sauce,...they put chipotle mayonnaise AND Santa Fe dressing (?) on them and they are served with Avocado cream sauce on the side. Quite heavy. You may want to order all of the condiments on the side if you aren't into creamy sauces and mayo. The Avocado egg roll appetizer was very good and everyone liked them. I liked that they have ""enlightened"" meals for the calorie conscious. The wings that were ordered at our table were lacking in wing sauce and extra had to be ordered, but tasted fine. The Jambalaya was very tasty if you are into spicy dishes. We will return to try the entree salads on the menu.

124,Tim H.,"Bridgewater, MA",49,40,8.0,1.0,2014-10-13,"Where do I start. Well, have visited 3 times. The service has steadily deteriorated. The first time ate lunch at the bar. The place had only been open a few weeks, and there were apparently ""trainers"" from another location with the new staff behind the bar. Service was super slow and inattentive - and the the training staff was way more interested in socializing with a customer seated next to me at the bar who was was another employee not currently working. My 2nd visit was this past Saturday evening. I checked in for priority seating using the mobile app. It says that after you arrive at the designated time you may experience a short wait for your table. Let's just say ""short"" wait is relative. The hostesses at the podiums - hmm - not very friendly or welcoming in any way. We were eventually seated and served by Bart who was friendly enough, but waited a while to see him, and a long time for food, drink refills, etc.. When a runner brought our food (luke warm -  had definitely all been sitting a while), I asked her for ketchup, and her reaction was priceless - akin to asking her for a kidney donation. Bart returned to our table about 5 mins later with a ketchup container that was 99% empty. The first squirt showered another person at our table with ketchup spray from all the air in the squeeze bottle. Now food is really cold. The crispy fries were a hit, and burger probably would have been great if it was hot (lots of restaurants put ketchup on your table as soon as they put burgers and fries down without asking). I received an email survey which I filled out, and received a nice email from Maurice the GM.  I returned today for lunch, sat at a high-top in the bar. Arrived at my seat at 12:02. Sat for about 12 mins before we were acknowledged and given menus. Iced tea arrived at 12:22, and after watching our server walk past us 3 times and not take our order, I left and went to Chili's at 12:29. Service is deplorable.

Fine since the weather is mild in Florida at the moment. Were seated at 7.10p. Server took our drinks almost straight away but didn't come back for nearly 20m. One in our party had asked for a sample of one of the seasonal beers. It was included when our drinks finally arrived but after she placed her order, it was almost 8p by the time get drink arrived! Another in our party asked for a Merlot and was brought a white wine, which we had to send back. When our appetizer was brought to the table, the runner didn't bother to bus the used dishes. It wasn't until we spoke to the manager that the service drastically improved. I can understand if there were numerous large parties, which there were this evening, but regardless the service was absolutely abysmal. I don't blame the server; I'm sure the the kitchen or bar was backed up, but it would have been nice to have been informed about the delay. Fortunately, we were enjoying each other's company so the delays weren't interminable. Food was okay - what you would expect from a chain.

Once seated we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks which were served after a late-comer to our party received her order. This is also after we were served our appetizers without being given any silverware. When we were finally able to get someone's attention to ask for silverware, we were told to wait. Silverware arrived just in time for us to eat our cold, rubbery calamari. We complained to the manager. He was going to check on the status of our meals and get back to us. We never saw him again...30-40 minutes went by... When our meals finally arrived they were served staggered. I had finished my mediocre burger before my husband was even served his 'Pizza Hut' style & tasting pizza.

103,Bob S.,"Oviedo, FL",0,6,,3.0,2015-05-11,"There's a reason this place (which has a very decent menu) has a lower review score than Steak & Shake, slow service and inconsistent food quality. We've been going to the Oviedo location since it opened, and the service has been in slow, steady decline. In fact, we've only had a decent experience once in our last 5 visits. It's not that the wait staff is bad, it's just that it takes so long to get drinks and or food.  Tonight may be our last trip here. We walked in around 6:30 (a Monday night). We were seated right away. The waiter who was very friendly took our drink order. It took almost 10 minutes for the drinks to come.  We ordered dinner, and waited almost 20 min to be served. The food was barely warm and had obviously been sitting around for a while. When the waiter came back to see how we were doing we told him the problem. His reaction was "" I can get new food cooked up for you, but I don't know how long that will take"". We decided to just bear with the tepid food until one of our party cut into his steak and found a huge knot of gristle.  I can't really blame the waiter. The problem is much deeper than that. Any place worth its salt would have a manager roaming around checking that the guests were having a great experience. We had two major problems with our meal and no manager was to be found.  We finally asked to see a manager. When she came out to see us the best she could do was offer us a free desert.

57,Harry W.,"Orlando, FL",36,70,13.0,3.0,2015-05-24,"I would love to give BJs more than three stars. We have been a few of them around the country including Louisville, KY and Los Angeles, CA. Although the Oviedo locations has about the same menu and a very decent guest tap selection, the food service (back, not front of the house) is bad. We went in to grab some brews and have a snack to help kill a part of a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered flights of all the BJ's beers, plus an Arrogant Bastard which you don't see on tap often. My wife and I are pretty picky about our beers, so you have to consider my review with that understood. Their beers are ok. Brewed at Brew Hub over in Lakeland, they are certainly competent versions of their respective beer styles -- better than we thought given corporate beers usually are often bland. The piranah and the tatonka were especially nice. I'm not sure if it was whatever was on the Arrogant Bastard tap before they switched the keg or if the bartender poured the wrong beer but it tasted like Blueberry, oh well.  The problem came when we ordered food. We ordered the Poke. It took FOREVER. The place was empty almost except for us. Poke is raw fish which doesn't seem like it ought to take long to dice and put on a plate, but it was at least 30 minutes. The folks next to us also waited quite a long time for their food. Besides the four of us at the bar, there was maybe two other tables in the whole place. Once we received the poke, the portion was very small. We had thought about getting something else, but we needed to be to work by Monday and couldn't imagine how long cooked food would take if raw food took this long. To sum up: The beer was good to really good (even with the weird thing with the AB). The food was ok and took forever.

My boyfriend and I have been told off by one of the servers and as they berated and belittled us in front of the manager (they were in the kitchen and you could hear them) the manager did absolutely nothing when we complained about hearing it and the service. Well today is another terrible day, with the 7 tables they have occupied things still take outrageous amounts of time to come out. We were here at 10:20 and the remainder of our food is coming out at midnight (technically there closed at this point). The manager Jaime who always seems to be the one working when things are at its worst doesn't help the situation much, bubbly personality but not the best at handling issues.

The wedge salad was okay with the blue cheese and balsamic glaze combined. There could of been a few more tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles. The buffalo burger was decent. The hand crafted root beer was really good. Really a 2.8 star rating. Probably better for wings and beer. I will give it another try but did not have anything other than the root beer that made me say wow. The server was pleasant and attentive and I give her 4 stars. There are plenty of TV sets to watch sports.  Not much on Monday right now unless you like watching paint dry. That means soccer was on.

The atmosphere is fine it's more like a high class pub with TVs playing sports. The wait wasn't long as it was only a Tuesday night. The kids menu was easy and more to the point than the regular adult menu which has way too much food and too confusing.  I ordered the calamari as my main course with a side salad, my youngest child had the corn dogs with a side of Caesar side salad, and my teenager had the chicken alfredo pasta my husband had the chicken wings.  The server forgot to bring my husband lemons for his drink three times as she passed by. She offered my son a side salad with his meal but failed to tell us that it was not part of the meal but it was an additional $3.50.  When the salads came out they had the wrong salad for my small child and were confused as to why we ordered a Caesar salad and why the waitress had approved it. Needless to say we did end up getting his salad. No big deal I could have gotten a better salad from a bag. Once the meals arrived, the food wasn't hot it was lukewarm. The wings were soggy not crispy, not great and the vegetables look like someone dropped them around hot sauce and they were messy. The corn dogs for some reason were served with dipping Caesar dressing instead of ketchup or any other kid friendly dipping sauce. My son did not like them as they were too sweet. The calamari was not great, I expected much better and I could have gotten the same out of a frozen bag of calamari fried at home. The best tasting was the chicken alfredo pasta even though it needed a bit of salt and it was over priced at $15. The waitress failed to come back to check on us a couple of times and my husband was given samples of beer and she forgot to come and ask him if he wanted an order of either one of them until it was way too late.

H.,"Orlando, FL",1,11,,2.0,2016-03-21,It's too bad that you only get half the experience at BJs as the food was good.  I was there and happened to be watching the NCAA National Championships for wrestling when the channel changed.   When I requested the channel back I was told that they don't show violent sports.  Seriously?  This is an age old sport that is an Olympic event.  I find it hypocritical  that a bar that makes its money selling alcohol draws the line w wrestling.  On top of it the general manager found the need to come over and gleefully deliver the message himself.  With attitude no less.  They've lost a solid customer as I will not be going back and will be sharing my view with anyone that will listen.  Since when did we become such a judgemental society?  Lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=100,2.64,2.64,2.64,3.24,2.64

56,Brad B.,"Oviedo, FL",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-02,"My most recent visit will be my last. This place continues to disappoint. They have some real issues with their standards and training. I hope the manager and/or ownership can fix the issues because the area needs more options for casual dining.  Let's start with basics. If you like eating with utensils, this place may not be for you. We thought the night was going to be a success because we actually got our silverware when seated. This was a groundbreaking first! I can't tell you how many times I have looked around the dining room to see food delivered to tables only to have dining delayed and food cooling further (more on that in a moment) while silverware is tracked down. A restaurant should have enough silverware to seat the entire restaurant all at once x 2.5-3.0. This place appears to be short on silverware. Literally, this visit was the first time we got it at time of seating. Progress that raised our hopes for a fleeting few minutes.  Now on to the food. If you like hot food, this is not the place for you. This restaurant appears to specialize in lukewarm food, which is not to my liking. The final straw, dinner for two - both were chicken dishes - both served lukewarm, one with room temp rice and beans and the other with room temp potatoes and uncooked broccoli. The broccoli wasn't cooked at all. Previous meals have been the mahi and shrimp in which I could either get hot fish or hot shrimp, but never both in the same serving. As someone who worked in the restaurant business for years, many of the first disappointments were overlooked. What can I say, I am too kind and forgiving. Then as what I hoped were exceptions showed themselves to be trends, I raised the issue to the manager. Maybe he didn't know and I could help him. The manager comped a few meals and apologized the last few times. But in the end, I am not going out for a free meal. I want a hot meal with silverware with which to eat it. I want to pay for a hot meal. A side note here. When the plate is hotter than the food, it means that the food died in the window. This is a restaurant term that means it was cooked and plated and placed under a heat lamp so long that the food cooled while the plate heated. When a server comes to you with a mitt or cloth to carry the plate, 90% of the time, this means your food has been sitting in the window for 5+ minutes. My last visit - warm plate lukewarm food. Wrapping this up, when I finally talk with the manager during my last visit, he says that this never happens. They never have this problem... They so rarely comp food... Well, he needs to read Yelp to see that this is a systemic problem that needs attention. Perhaps they need a new manager with open eyes to see the problems. But, this guy seems nice enough so I hope he can turn things around.  The servers here need training too. Two tables next to us tonight got their dinner salads and soups 10 seconds before their entrees. Pacing of a meal is a concept that needs training at this location. Appetizers or salads or soups should be served with ample time to eat them without stacking plates on a table. It is bad practice for so many reasons- food cools further before it is eaten being among them. It also makes people look glutinous to have 2-3 plates per guest on the table. Also, drinks/glasses should not be touched such that a servers fingers are around the rim of the glass. It's disgusting. And, though we have had some that are friendly, most appear to be rather disappointed to be working there.  I would offer that this manager should visit some competing restaurants to see how they do things. Almost anyplace in the area is better (sorry Rock & Brews - you struggle with cooking food thoroughly). The potential is there for a good experience. The recipes are good. The atmosphere is good. If they could just get hot food to the table with silverware already in place, we would be regular diners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,3.0440000000000005,2.6

My husband and I have both worked in restaurants before so we didn't feel like raising a fuss and simply left him a lower tip than what we normally leave (since he fully admitted it was his fault so it wouldn't have been fair for the restaurant to pay for it anyways).

We kept coming back because of the nearby location. But After about six meals I told my wife I was done with BJ's. The service is consistently clumsy and the dishes remind me of microwaved Swanson's or something equally bland. The crew exhibits little teamwork. For example, the food runner plopped our lunch on the table and looked bewildered when I ordered a glass of Zinfandel (Ravenswood is what they offer). Our original waitress showed up 10 minutes later with a container of white zinfandel. She failed to return before the well-intended manager asked the obligatory, ""How is everything?"" I mentioned the wine snafu and he trotted off, returning with the correct beverage. But he left empty glasses on the crowded table instead of clearing them. Simple story but it illuminates a typical experience. If the food were delicious I could overlook the stumbling staff. But It's not even close to good.

The problem there is chains just don't do well in the Bay Area and therefore get the worst employees the restaurant industry has to offer. Now I live in Florida again and BJ's has infiltrated here as well, with better service and food, but still nothing worth writing home about. BJ's is a typical American joint, on par with Chili's or Applebee's. There is nothing on the menu that is interesting or exceptional. 90% of the dishes have meat and/or cheese in them, and were you to remove the meat and/or cheese, there would not be much of a dish left. In other words, animal products are the star of everything, and removing them would leave you with condiments essentially. If you are looking for something ""light"" (as in, not a calorie bomb), you will also have some trouble here. Even their light options are kind of calorie-heavy and again, with the gaping absence of produce in every dish, extremely unimaginative. If you are a vegetarian or omnivore, you will fare better, of course. Good things.... They offer happy hour. Their lunch menu ""pick two"" option is decent.

Also it took another 10 minutes to get our food orders taken. The food came out luke-warm. It wasn't that good. My brother got the Parmesan crusted chicken. It smelled terrible and the presentation was poor. My friend got the sirloin (ordered medium rare). When it came out it was not medium rare it was very rare. It had no flavor and it was mostly gristle. I got a deep dish pizza and it came out cold. The pan wasn't even hot at all. The only reason I'm giving the place 3 stars is because their house made root -beer is fantastic and the manager was nice enough to let us use 3 of the buy one entree get one free coupons.  Maybe you should hire more wait staff because our server had way to many tables to take care of at once.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2?start=40,3.52,3.17,3.17,3.0200000000000005,3.31

I give them overall 2.5 stars but I'm rounding to three because the flavors weren't too bad.  Alex and I came in on a Friday night to give it a shot, and to my surprise, the restaurant was almost empty.  We stood up at the front for a few minutes until somebody noticed we were there. She yelled to the host that she had people up front needed to be sat. The host greeted us and sat us at an booth.  Soon after, our server came by and took our drink orders. She offered us the house made award winning beers, but it was late and we were already tired so we decided against it and got the strawberry lemonade and cream soda. The lemonade was very delicious! It was thick and seemed to use real strawberries in it. The cream soda was also AMAZING! I'm not generally a fan of cream soda but this one was the best.  It took so long for us to choose what we wanted to eat. The menu is over 20 pages long! We decided to share a soup, which only comes as a one size option and we upgraded to a bread bowl. The top cut out part of the bread bowl was completely SOAKED in butter. Ugh. The soup itself had a good flavor, but there was SO much oil pooled up on top of it.. it was hard to look at. (see image)  As an entree, I ended up going with a Parmesan crusted chicken entree served with broccoli and cheesy mashed potato. The chicken had an okay flavor. It wasn't until I was done with the first piece of chicken that I realized each time I had to cut into it, a HUGE amount of oil seeped out of it and it made me not want the second piece anymore. :( The broccoli was fine. Tasted like normal broccoli. But the potatoes.. have you ever microwaved mashed potatoes at home and you accidentally microwave it too long and it crusts up in several areas? That's how this one was. It was crusted in certain places and was very clearly microwaved.. My entree was overall disappointing.  Alex went with a small pizza with pepperoni. It tasted pretty good! Except it was just a little too doughy for us.  Service was eh. For a dead night with almost nobody there, service was a little slow. I didn't understand why until I noticed all of the night time servers sitting around by the bar talking to other people at a high tops while they weren't busy with their guests.  I'm unsure if I ever want to return to BJ's. I would definitely get something different next time. Something that hopefully won't have a sh*t ton of oil everywhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oviedo-2,3.16,3.18,3.18,,3.1720000000000006

11,Rebecca O.,"Sanford, FL",79,66,672.0,4.0,2017-05-20,"I am giving BJ's a four star rating. When it comes to restaurants, my ratings are usually giving stars to the same in its class. So for this one it would be as compared to Applebee's or to a TGI Fridays type rating. I would say this is my first time coming here and the food was pretty good. We started off with the Parmesan garlic wings and those are pretty good. We also had the avocado eggrolls. Those on the other hand were disgusting and only a bite was taken from one of them and the rest were thrown away. So if you're going to order them don't. Then we ordered entrées. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with the corn and the couscous macaroni and cheese. The corn was like a ginger or something like that and it was awesome. It had some bacon bits in it that really pulled out the flavor. I also had the couscous which I was more wanting to try it just to see how it would taste. It was pretty awesome. My friend got the deep dish pizza with the meets on it and it looked really good I didn't try it though. Then we ordered the mini Pizzookies sampler I guess it's called. It comes with three mini pizzookies of your choice. If any of you don't know what a Pizzookie is, it is a cookie in a form of a pizza. There's also one that is a monkey bread that they have as another option to choose. We chose the white chocolate macadamia nut, the triple chocolate, and the peanut butter ones. All were awesome. You can't go wrong with a cookie in the shape of a pizza. All in all, this place is pretty good. And on top of that the staff was pretty good.

We were the last 7 people standing around waiting for a table and 2 of us had checked the status at different times and the hostess still spoke to the open lobby and didn't look at us and called our parties name. There was no apology and no manager rounding to address the issue. Then even after we sat it took awhile for our food to come. Our Server bless her heart was very sweet and nice. The food was good I will give it that, but over priced especially for the experience we had. I will be avoiding this place and not recommending it to anyone. There are better places with good food and service that I would suggest. It could also have been not as bad if a manager would have come and addressed the issue.

It has come out way after appetizers...  and just arrives with other entrees, and even then it was pretty long. I do specify that we would like her meal come out first, as a parent of a little one and to have a stress free dinner it is much easier to get her fed first.  The food is pretty mediocre, I think the pizza is the only thing that is worth getting. Their BJ Brewhouse burger was was too salty and overall greasy. The boneless wings with sriracha dry rub is not great, I would not suggest getting any dry rub for that matter, flavor profile just does not work.

The bar area is fairly roomy, and quite a few beers on draft, both well known brands and crafts, as well as the brews exclusive to the brand. They aren't lacking in wines and spirits either, and I highly recommend the pomegranate sangria or whatever the exact name is (I will say though, I think it's a seasonal beverage. So FELIZ NAVIDAD and have a few of those!) I didn't have a large dinner, but the menu is well appointed with a variety of appetizers, salads, Flatbreads, sandwiches and burgers, and assorted entrees.  I ordered the potstickers and couscous Mac and cheese. GET THE MAC AND CHEESE, it was VERY delicious, hearty, and the tapas portion was just right!
