The only time I usually come to BJ's now is between 3-7pm on weekdays...HAPPY HOUR!  Most of the time if you get there before 5 you don't even have to wait for a place to sit. Happy hour specials include: $1 off draft beer and cocktails $2 off appetizers Half off mini pizzas   Add all those up and you can have a whole meal for a whole lot less than usual.  They will let you order your mini pizza just about any way you want it...I order mine with white Alfredo sauce, pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese.  Totally amazing. I also consider their fried artichoke hearts the best I have ever had...today during happy hour I had two orders.

I was in Ventura this weekend and was hankering for some Asian food since it's difficult to find in SB. I found 2 places that had solid 4 star ratings on yelp, but when I got to the places, they looked like dingy food court establishments (not naming any names...). Now, while that's fine for a quick meal during the work day, I wanted something more for dinner. After driving back and forth several times, we ended up at BJ's Pizza. We haven't been here in 2+ years, since the last 2 we were in Boston and they aren't in SB (big surprise). We ordered a medium pizza, half BJ's Favorite and half Mediterranean with an Italian Market salad. The bf got their brew of the day and I got their black cherry soda. We finished our meal (as gluttonous as it was), with the Oreo cookie pizookie. (The bf chose it b/c it's the ""only one that had 3 scoops of ice cream"", which is funny since he's not a big dessert person.) The food is always consistent here and I'm a fan of the deep dish, so I enjoyed it. I've never had the soda before and thought it was good, and the bf enjoyed his microbrew.

264,Princess Kim R.,"San Diego, CA",121,250,,2.0,2012-09-24,"My boyfriend and I ventured into Oxnard late one night after spending entirely too much time being lazy in Ventura. What were we doing? Honestly, I don't remember. It probably involved some combination of watching wack comedy, doing our best sloth impressions on his couch, and me avoiding his cat like it was carrying the Black Plague. At any rate, we needed late-night food, and this was one of the few places that was open. We got there maybe a half hour before closing time, which I feel is all right. We wouldn't walk in 10 minutes before midnight or anything. We're not dicks, even if one of us has some pretty great man bits (Hint: It's not me.). We ordered our food, and since I knew the kitchen was closing and wanted a dessert that usually takes some advance notice, I asked if I should put in the order for it right then, with the food. The server was a doll and told me that I still had time, and that I could wait. Cool. It's nice to be able to eat and not feel rushed. The food arrived, and it was pretty forgettable. I know, I know. It's chain restaurant food. It's not supposed to be memorable. Anyway, I don't remember gagging, and I certainly didn't feel the need to give up on life while eating there (I'm looking at you, Crapplebee's). The food by itself would probably get 3 stars. Here's where things took a turn for the worse. After we'd gotten our bill, I was pulling money out of my bag to pay, and some scrotum-head security guard on a power trip walked over, swinging his flashlight and clearly mistaking himself for a big, swinging dick in the world of chain restaurant security. ""Hey, you guys need to wrap it up, eh? We're trying to get home."" Dude, who the fuck are you? Our server is the one busting her ass, and she's being WAY more patient and polite than you are. Also, what do you think I'm planning on doing with this cash? Making it rain? Trust me, the only selling point to Oxnard is that the boxer Sergio Martinez lives here, and since I haven't seen him around this joint, I'm making like a tree and leaving.  After we'd paid and were approaching the door, we came across the same security guard, only this time, he was accompanied by a member of the restaurant staff. He wished us a good night in front of the staff member as if he hadn't just tried to shake us from the place like the last drops of pee at a urinal. My boyfriend, being more outspoken than I am, gave him a sarcastic, ""Yeah, ok."" I gave him a jerk-off motion. Behind his back. In my head.

Ordered the chicken fried steak.  Took a while to get it, and when I did, it was tough.  The sauce had melted and the plate was hot, indicating it was sitting in the service window for a while (used to work at a restaurant).  The menu description said the gravy was a pepper gravy, but it was like liquid and absolutely flavorless. My wife ordered her turkey cobb sandwich without tomato.  But she could taste that it had been there, and they removed it (pregnant women can taste anything!).

288,Natals P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,14,242.0,4.0,2013-02-10,"I'm new to the west coast and was pleasantly surprised by this chain brewery/restaurant. I've been about four times now and cannot say I've been knocked out by their beers, but they offer other breweries on draft and in bottles at reasonable prices. There is a decent amount of vegetarian options as far as bar fare is concerned. The pizzas are pretty tasty with loads of options for toppings, though watch out-the price for toppings can add up quickly. I'd recommend going during happy hour when the beers are cheaper and the mini pizzas are half price. Now THAT is a good deal! Apparently it can get really crowded here, but only once did I have to wait and it was only 10 minutes at the most. I think the service could be stepped up just a notch as far as attentiveness is concerned. They have a rewards program,  but I had to ask about it, and I've never been asked about it when I pay resulting in me forgetting and having to go online to get credit for the visit. I have yet to see the benefits of the rewards program but my coworker said it was worth it. I guess whatever reward comes will be worth it since its free. They seem to be very accommodating to groups, which was my first visit, but that was also the worst service I experienced - relatively speaking. To the servers credit, she was extremely friendly and did what she could to remedy the issues immediately.  Overall, a relaxed atmosphere that is a nice place to go for a beer or two with friends.

Got to our table ordered food .. The waiter didn't write our order down but I've seen that before, but I was a little nervous when he questioned what I ordered and I had to repeat two times what I said. Food took about 30 minutes to get out and when it did we had still yet to receive utensils and napkins we asked for.. And of course my food order was wrong. when we told the guy who brought it out it was he said he'd take care of it, since he was different from our server he goes to the back about 4 minutes later out actual server comes out with the same plate and says ""this is what you ordered."" I had to hold back laughing at him because I was completely shocked he would come out let alone after the plate had been sitting for a whole and tell me I WAS WRONG. Then says he can just add to the order if what I had wasn't enough. We said no. And he put the plate down since we just settled after being starved. Of course it was cold. Didn't even want to complain because clearly it wouldn't have mattered if that is how customers are treated. I should've known considering when we sat down the table behind us had just complained that their food was cold. Needless to say I didn't get my pizookie so that's sad but I didn't even want to be in the place anymore after being told I was wrong and served cold food.

So my new favorite addition is on the appetizer menu: Dry Rub Chicken Wings in Lemon Pepper; man these babies are deeelicious! Talk about the right way to cook a chicken wing, it's all about the crunch secondary to the flavor and these wings have it all! 10 wings for $10.50 may be a bit pricey, but if you come in during HH, it's $2 off! Plus the mini pizzas are pretty much half off-you chose from the many flavors from their regular sized pizza-great selection on flavors!  I highly recommend coming in during Happy Hour, & sit at the bar otherwise service at the regular dinning tables will be slow to non-existent.  Enjoy!  Reviewed on 9/22/2013 Always a good time at Bj's! Love sitting at the bar area, because you get to watch sports on their HUGE Tv screens and the servers are very personable.

232,Merbita J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,17.0,1.0,2013-11-11,"We have been patrons of BJ's for years and have enjoyed delicious food and exceptional service.  However, based upon our experience this past Saturday, we will no longer be dining at any of their restaurants.  With every point of contact, from the hostess to several of the wait staff, we were treated with much indifference.  Upon our arrival (which was around 4pm to beat the dinner rush), the hostess for the evening greeted us with a forced smile and then had us waiting while she took a phone call for several minutes.  I have worked in the food and service industry in the past, and one very important thing I learned was to always first serve those who are right in front of you.  A phone call can wait.   When we were finally seated, our low-energy waitress provided us with lackluster service.  I believe she had 3 small tables total, but was hardly attentive.  We found it odd because she kept disappearing to the kitchen, but would return with nothing.   And speaking of the kitchen, the food was truly disappointing.  We were actually there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  My husband and I were so looking forward to indulging in some of their beautifully crafted beers, mouth-watering pizzas, and, of course, end our special night with a scrumptious pizookie!  However, we should have known something was terribly wrong when we each received a dinner salad that was almost a third full of wilted, glassy-looking lettuce.   We let the salad slide because perhaps it was just a fluke.  But then, we received our hand tossed, thin crust pizza and we were so disheartened from the appearance alone.  The pizza was sloppily put together with strands of partially melted cheese on top strewn across the top.  Indeed, we found our pizza to be lukewarm at best and the taste was substandard.  What happened to the BJ's quality we had come to know and love?! Suffice it to say, our anniversary dinner was not what we were hoping it would be.  It was memorable, but unfortunately, not in a good way.  We could have eaten anywhere we wanted, but chose BJ's based on our past experiences, the amazing food, and quick, friendly service.  The management needs to be held accountable for the poor quality of food & the apathetic employees.  So disappointed at what this restaurant has become.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=220,2.8,3.02,3.02,1.924,2.9320000000000004

Unfortunately BJ's isn't the only restaurant in that neck of the woods anymore. This place has really gone down hill. My girlfriends and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night. It was busy but nothing like what it used to be. I had requested a booth and a high chair since we had a baby in our group which they kindly accommodated. That's where the good service ends. Our server was sweet, but she took a very, very long time to get over to our table. Our drinks didn't come out fast, mind you, we ordered sodas and iced tea not alcoholic beverages. We didn't put our order in until about 30 minutes after we sat down. She wasn't coming over to our table to often and didn't look our way so we couldn't flag her down. Again sweet girl but hmmmm. My friend and I ordered there $35 special which included a choice of 2 salads, 2 entrees and dessert for 2 people. I thought it was a pretty good deal! Our food didn't come out for another who knows how long. My girlfriends and I couldn't figure out what was taking so long. Again, they weren't all that busy. But we figured something was up because the booth behind us had an issue with their order. The manager came over and offered to comp their meals. He came over again at the same booth (different party) and offered to comp their entire meal. Hmmmm. Where was our apology or comp offer??? Our server, again very sweet, was kind enough to split our checks. My friend and I who ordered the $35 special paid with our credit cards. Our server came over and was going over the receipt with my friend. I was sitting at the end of the booth so didn't peek or really hear the conversation. I tossed my card over and figured everything must have checked out correctly. When my receipt came the total was about $25. It didn't hit me until it was too late. We were overcharged! I understand tax, tip and beverages were not included but I'm still trying to figure out how we each paid $25 (not including tip) for a $35 special for 2!

Well we called earlier to make a reservation and was told that they had a party at 6:30 but to come in and they would accommodate us and we would wait for a bit. So we all showed up at 6:15 and we were told it would only be an hour wait...so we waited. Around 7:45 we began to get inpatient and asked again...the hostesses were so rude to us telling us it would be about 1-2 more hours so I asked to speak to the manager who's name was Lisa and well she wasn't much help at all. They said well we have another party coming in so you have to wait until we are done with them. Not knowing that we had been looking at the patio area this whole time where its set up for big parties and it had been empty the whole time we were there waiting no party at 6:30 showed up. I was frustrated and upset especially because the staff was giggling at us rather than trying to accommodate  us. We didn't get any apology for making us wait an hour already then telling us it was going to be 2 more hours. If they would have told us when we got there it was going to be a 3 hour wait we would have gone somewhere else rather than wasting our time. After all that we ended up leaving...and your restaurant had a no show of the 50+ party they had supposedly told us they had at 7:30. You know one thing is to upset me as an adult I can handle it. What I can't handle was disappointing my 15 year old nephew. Your restaurant lost our business along with the other 2 parties that never showed up. You really should enforce better customer service to your staff. I know you probably don't care that I'm ranting on about my experience and you will probably brush it off. I just thought I would let you know how your restaurant in oxnard california is being operated. Totally unprofessional.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=400,2.28,2.81,2.81,1.988,2.598

We did have to wait for a few stragglers to show up, which was about 30 minutes, so it took extra time to order- not the waitresses fault,but by the time we were ready to order in the next five minutes, the waitress was no where in site. Everyone was starving, my son finally asked a waiter to bring fries just to suffice. This waitress let our drinks dwindle to nothing, we had to flag her to ask for refills, and she never checked us otherwise...but definitely was quick to remove our plates when we finished our food. We didn't get her name unfortunately- she was brunette, 5'4 maybe . Thankfully the food was bomb! We do give thanks to the chefs!

Ive been coming to this restaurant with my family for years. I understand Fathers day is busier than usual but our service was crap and i hope a manager reads this and gets back to me or I will do it right after this.  The plates for my family of six took a long time. (again I understand it was a busy day so we waited patiently).  When the food finally arrived i had to wait another 15-20 minutes for my SALAD. My mom ordered a pepsi after i got my food and we didnt get that until the check came. I suggested to my mom that she shouldnt leave a good tip, but my mom still left her 15% on our $100+ bill. Before we left i asked our waitress if my dad was going to get a Fathers day cup (which is given away every year and we saw everyone getting one). She said ""i dont know anything about cups but ill check to see if maybeee theres something"" we waited for about 15 minutes but decided to head out. Our waitress passed by our table at least 3 times and never got back to us.  As we walked out a bus boy noticed that my dad was empty handed and asked us to wait and gave him a Fathers day cup... i regret the tip the waitress received-she didn't deserve a dime. Unfortunately, i cant remember her name but it may have been Shanna.

I am Asian but married to a Caucasian. Whenever I am with my family, without my husband, we are treated very poorly. The service gets significantly better only when my husband is with us.  The food is great, no doubt about that. But it isn't worth going because there is always a long wait. Food served is always wrong. I can go on and on about my complaints but I am sure a lot of people have already experienced the same.  My favorite on their menu is the spaghetti with spicy sauce and meatballs. The last time I was there, I had to return it twice because they kept giving me the wrong sauce (it was a red marinara sauce with meat and not spicy at all, not the orange-ish colored, spicy one I always had) When I complained, they told me that was the only sauce they had, when I argued even more, they said they no longer served it the way they did before? WTF? Also, the breadsticks that came with the spaghetti were so burnt they did not even look edible.  Another time I was there with my two kids, we were seated after a long wait. We had our menu closed and waited for a host to greet us and get our order but nobody came. There were waiters passing our table left and right, but nobody stopped at our table. After half an hour sans service, we walked out.  Shitty, shitty restaurant, the worst ever in my books. We are never going back there again.

It made my date and I felt very very very uncomfortable. It really felt awkward everytime he would walk by us and not make a smile or even eye contact.  The mini pizza arrived 30 minutes later, and still we have not received napkins or any utensils. It was 4 slices, and it was not the very best because my date only ate 1 and i had 2.

BJ's pizza used to be a nice pie with ample toppings at a moderate price which I was okay paying for knowing I was going to get a well made, properly cooked pizza pie. I'm not a regular as in every week or month but WOW it is truly a pathetic pizza. If I wanted a pizza with the sauce showing through because there was no cheese or toppings, I would pay the $5-6 for a Caesars or Papa Johns.  So disappointed. Not planning to go back and if for some reason I do, it won't be for pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=200,2.84,2.65,2.65,2.6320000000000006,2.726

I diced it and placed it over the salad. Great option for vegetarians! I've ordered it a few times since.  Also, you can sub most items that contain meat with black beans.  The environment is bright, casual, in and out quickly and sports on flat screens so no  matter where you sit you can watch something while dining. I have not yet dined outside but will next time.

Our server was friendly and did a good job of serving our lunch of the Santa Fe salad (lots of not so green lettuce) and the BBQ chicken salad, which had a very small splash of BBQ sauce that was to mean it was a BBQ salad. The salad was very bland due to the lettuce being almost all pale green and no GREEN lettuce in the salad. The chicken was moist and not dried out which was the saving grace.

I finally complained ( I rarely do) and he argued with me. There is only on plate he says. One plate with four other dishes stacked on it, which he reluctantly cleared. The three stars was for the food and most of the staff friendly. I left a decent tip $15 on a $108 bill because I figured poor training or perhaps my mistake having dinner in a sports bar.

Let's fast forward 7 years and we now have me ordering alcoholic drinks and the Lakers with a lottery pick in this years draft..my my how times have changed I called ahead of time for a table, which they allow you to do for parties less than 8..and I asked for a booth for 2..caller beware as this place has 2 person booths..so if you wants a large booth make sure you specify. I had read the reviews, so when I walked in to non smiling faces I wasn't surprised..hostess boy was probably the nicer out of the 3 in the front. Smile a bit and be happy you're not working across the stop sign frying fries all day. (-) After being sat I got my own first smile in there after realizing that they show Dodgers games there..if you're a fan you know how rare that is to find north of LA. So grateful to watch the win that night. Within a minute or two ""Sean L."" (receipt description) presented himself as our waiter. That guy came through and honestly put the people in the front to shame. He was consistent throughout the night and never seemed bothered at my more than handful requests..young guy too which was more impressive as he was giving up his saturday night at work and just did it with smiles. The only time fluke was when he was applying a discount but only because of him needing supervisor approval..when he came back he even apologized for the delay..couldn't have asked for a better table experience service wise. 5/5 Food: Wings:  Chicken wasn't bad and the sauces were okay. Tasted very tyson like but these came through enough while I watched Joc Pederson at bat. 2.7/5 Salad: Spent my side salad doing scoliosis checks because it had nothing but lettuce spines..dry taste..ate it but not delightfully. 1.5/5 Pizza: Good pizza, not too cheesy which is perfect for me..the toppings tasted were an upgrade above the ones had at pizza rev the day before and the fluffiness to it was nice. It could have been cooked just a tiny more to give it a crisp but not bad, not bad at all. 3.5/5 Drinks: Strawberry Splash- This is kind of their signature drink..but it didn't live up to the hype. It was okay but didn't have a nice fruitful taste like you'd expect it to have based off the name. Just something about it 2.5/5 Strawberry Patch- Same story. 2.5/5 Drinks here are okay, they have selection, so I'd recommend just getting what you get at a normal bar and not going after their ""signature"" stuff. My regret. Overall, not a bad chain. I would say I won't be back until the Lakers are in the ship again but with the dodger's on their tv's i'm sure it'll be sooner than a decade from now. Food isn't bad (just fix the salad), drinks can potentially be fine and our waiter proved that good service is possible here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=40,2.92,2.71,2.908,2.636,2.7939999999999996

Saw a server attend to a table behind us and glanced our way when he walked by. That was the last straw.

We waited about 20 minutes die someone to at least come by.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to leave and as we walked out he told the hosts that no one went to our table and that we were leaving.

96,Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1403,10421.0,3.0,2015-08-17,"After having such a tasty lunch at BJ's in Thousand Oaks I decided to have dinner here at BJ's in Oxnard with my husband last night, but based on our experience I am not sure we'll be back.   We were seated promptly at a table.  The restaurant was pretty busy and no booths looked available so I didn't even bother asking.  We were seated next to a large party of 7 adults and 3 kids.  Why do I always get stuck next to little kids?  Anyway, our server introduced himself right away and took our drink order.  Our sodas came to the table quickly and we then ordered appetizers, but after that was done, no one came to check on us for what felt like an eternity.  We were ready to order our main dishes but I got the impression our server was going to wait until the appetizers arrived, which was probably not correct since he isn't even the one that brought out the appetizers anyway... The calamari and brussel sprouts we ordered came to the table maybe 15 min after we ordered them.  During that time the large party of 10 was looking around for someone to help them.  They had drinks but no one had taken their main order yet.  They flagged someone down and I watched as the employee immediately notified our server, who was busy at the kiosk putting an order in or something.  I then watched our server check on another table, deliver a drink and wander into the back kitchen area.   Maybe five minutes after the large table had asked for help our server appeared and took their orders.  My husband's drink and mine were empty at this point and our server eventually came back to our table, refilling my diet coke with ice tea and delivering a fresh soda water to my husband with ice in the glass (as opposed to his first glass and request of no ice).  I got my drink corrected and our order was finally taken.  I wanted a custom cookie dessert and our server said he'd see if they could make it.  Later he came back to inform me that they could not make it the way I had requested.  Instead of offering me the menu to make another selection, he just left the table.  I had to wait for him to come back to order again. Food was okay but I didn't realize the batter they use on their calamari had some heat to it, maybe a 1.5 on a scale of 0 to 10.  Just enough to make me regret ordering it.  Also though some of the squid rings were tender, I'd say about half were too chewy and the tentacles were very chewy and overcooked.    My side salad was okay, though the staff treated it as if it was my entrée and didn't bring it out when they brought my husband's side-salad out.  I had ordered the side salad and then a dessert, hoping that would be my entrée but since my dessert request got declined and I wasn't offered an alternative I sat around wondering what I was even going to eat. In the end I got a different dessert and that was the highlight of my visit.  The dessert was fantastic, the salad was all right and the appetizer I got wasn't what I wanted.  My husband ate his brussel sprouts but didn't have much good to say about them.  "".... maybe... if they had more sauce?""  He enjoyed his flat iron steak and steamed vegetables. Women's restroom was clean and well-stocked.  Temperature in the restaurant was kept low and the lights were not bright. It was loud inside (even before one of the kids at the table next to us started wailing and screeching) and would be good if you wanted to watch one of the games on TV but not for a casual/comfortable date spot. Service: 2 stars - meh, I've had better Food: 3 stars, mostly for the dessert One last note - hubby and I noticed the water conservation sign on the host stand when we entered so we were surprised when our server came to our table with glasses of water we didn't want and set them down for us.  We told him we didn't want them and he took them away and put them back on the bar counter.  Maybe he didn't get the memo?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=80,3.04,2.78,2.88,2.54,2.8840000000000003

Decided to eat here last night and boy what a mistake that was.  First we tell them that we need a table for 6, preferably a booth. They sat us at a table for 4 then they're scrambling to find two other chairs once I told her we are 6 not 4. I asked what about a booth and she said there is nothing else available. I told her what about the booth right behind us. She said it's not available, but nobody was sitting there, ok. Then it took about 15-20min before the waiter even came to our table and when he did he didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink, he dropped of the silverware and napkins and left. I was sarcastic when he came by and dropped off the silverware, he said you guys are going to need these as I replied yes and some DRINKS too and all he did was laugh. That didn't even seem to work!!! We sat for over 30min before we got anything to drink. Any other time I would of just left. I don't know why I didn't do it this time. The service was just HORRIBLE! We ordered the appetizer when we ordered our drinks and we didn't get it till about 5min before our meal came.  Throughout this entire time I asked one of them idiots in all black if we where going to get some kind of service soon, we've been sitting here for 30min and nothing to drink. She said yes I'm really sorry and someone will come to help you. Right there and then she should of went out of her way and asked what we wanted to drink. Not to mention our pizzas where cold. Our food was probably done but our waiter never checked, cause it wasn't until I asked if our food was coming soon and our waiter gasped and said oh yes let me check. So basically we sat for about 1hr 15min before we even started to eat. Manager never bothered to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything as he walked right next to us asking the other tables. I've heard from others that the service has gone downhill lately, it is very true. So many other great places to eat in Ventura county that as a customer you don't really need to put up with crap like this.

The wait time for our meals was a bit long, and while I realize a group of that size was challenging, some of the ladies ordered upon entering the restaurant, because they had to leave early, and the meals did not come out until almost an hour later, and one persons meal never came out so they had to reenter the order, and someone had to take it home for her and bring it to her today. As for the rest of us that stayed, there were many positive comments on the meals, one person ordered the Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and corn, she said it was so moist and the coating on the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Another person got the BBQ Pizza, she said she gets it all the time and that everyone should order it. I saw an awesome Club Sandwich that made me wish I'd picked that over my order. Leading to my order: I chose the BBQ Brisket Burger,  which consisted of Patty topped with smoked brisket pieces, Applewood smoked bacon, shredded jack and cheddar cheese,  bbq sauce, red onions and mayonnaise. I asked for no Mayo, BBQ sauce and Mayo just did not sound right in this girls eyes.   Burger Wise, I was truly disappointed in this burger, the meat was dry, the bun was dry, the cheese was not melted, and there was little to no BBQ sauce on the burger.... the positive the wedge fries were good, and so was the Strawberry Margarita I had.

Last night was the first time I opted to try the curbside pickup and not to self, never will I make that mistake again. I ordered via their website what I thought was primarily a simple process however I guess the employees cant read and interpret what the screen displays. No wonder why most restaurants are opting for computers without human interference. I ordered CALIFORNIA CHICKEN CLUB, NO TOMATO add MUSTARD, Thin fries with cheese and a dessert and submitted my order to be picked up at 6:30 pm. I caught my own error bc I placed the make and model of a GTI 2 door as the pickup vehicle. When I arrived  they were no pickup curbside spots available so I parked 2 spots over and called them and spoke to whoever answered the phone and told them that I was in a Nissan Sentra instead of GTI and that I was parked 2 spots down. That fell on deaf ears since I see Glenda walking out to the curbside with bags and going back inside the restaurant. I knew that was my order. I gave it 10 mins and I called again and Glenda picked up. I told her the same story that I did to some other rep a few mins ago and she apologized and came outside. As soon as she gave me order, I asked her does my fries have cheese...she looked confused and she said I can get cheese added to them. 10 minutes later she comes back with fresh fries but at this point my sandwich was soggy bc of the steam and being in a closed container 35 mins later. When I got home with my soggy sandwich I opened it up and bingo no mustard and soggy, old lettuce. I laughed it off at this point and realized the sticker on the box said ""add mustard"" ""cheese to fries""!!!! Why, is it so hard to follow directions. I blame myself also since I was too lazy to call the manager, too lazy to get dressed and dine in. There you have my  list a few grievances, spending close to $43 on 3 meals to have soggy sandwich and warm fries, I would expect that at a McDonalds certainly not this place.

For the next 15 minutes the entire wait staff fussed over a party of about 12 people, moving them, chatting with them, bringing drinks, etc. I ordered the special Ginger IPA and was excited to try it. My friend, upon advice from our waitress, decided to test mine before ordering a full glass, as it's a hoppy beer, and not for the uninitiated or faint of heart. We ordered the avocado rolls because we were so hungry.... and thought they would go well with the beer. quite a while later we were informed (very casually) that there was no more Ginger. Big disappointment. 5pm on Saturday of Father's Day weekend, and no Ginger IPA to be had. Waitress didn't make any other suggestions, so I just ordered plain tea, which arrived along with my friend's water. We asked twice about our avocado rolls, and were told they were being assembled. No suggestions or inquiries about food. Ice tea quickly disappeared, as the glass was mostly filled with ice. No more tea, no more waitress. Another person brought the avocado rolls, but neither noticed, nor offered more water or tea. The rolls were a bit spicy for my senior friend, and the sauce completely off the chart, so we flagged down our waitress and asked for sweet and sour or some other ""suitable"" substitute. Another long wait.... and we snagged her attention, and she informed us that the manager had advised her that there simply was nothing that could be done. At this point my friend ordered our check. Still no more tea, no water, and leftover avo-rolls. No inquiries, no offers, no apologies, which is not what I have come to enjoy or expect from BJs. I had been going to Yard House and Lazy Dog to try them out, and sadly have come to the realization that BJs is suffering from the competition and is either not training people to ""compete"" or just not carefully monitoring what was not at all a busy store at 5 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=280,2.92,2.91,2.812,2.216,2.9139999999999997
167,Denise G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,2.0,2016-06-19,"BJs is one of my all time favorite restaurants to order from. 99.9% of the time, my husband and I order take out. No complaints there. Our order is always accurate, on time as promised through their app and delicious!  Since today is Father's Day, my husband and I decided to go dine in and actually have lunch . There was a gentleman up front that told us there was a 20 min wait. No problem. We'll wait. But what bothered me is when I stared seeing other walk ins (not reservations because I was near the desk to hear) that were also party's of 2 being seated before us. 2 other party's to be exact! They had plenty of seating so not sure what was this issue there.  When we were finally seated, we asked if we can have a booth since we had our 7 month old with us. The gentleman said no because they ""didn't have enough servers"" so we settled into one of their smaller 2 person booths. Keep in mind we had our son, which we had asked for a high chair before even being seated and was not given, his diaper bag, toys and snacks to keep him entertained. We could NOT fit in this small space. 10 min later when our waiter finally did arrive we asked to be moved to a booth where we had previously seen was an area she was handling. With an attitude she exhales deeply like it was a bother to her and says ""I can do it this time because there's not that many people."" Ok..   We finally get seated, she gives us our menus and says she will be back. We already knew what we wanted, we get the same meals whether it's take out or the rare times we dine in.. We told her as soon as we sat that we were ready to order. She let us know she would be back. I kid you not 15 min passed and she did not return. I became irritated and told my husband it was time to leave. The gentleman that had previously seated us, looked at us and gave us what I believe was a rude look. Didn't ask if there was a problem or anything.  Can't say they were busy either.

When I got to my hotel room, there were at least 3 pieces that didn't have any toppings on them. They have a special ""to go"" section that you order from, so the people that are helping us there should know that it's to go...no napkins, no utensils. Come on Shasta D, if someone tips you for a to go order, you should make sure they have everything they need before bringing the bag to them. The young man at the front counter helped me with that so thank you. The pizza was soggy and flavorless. I have had some great food and beer before so I was expecting something good!

When we got the bill we were charged for 4 drink tickets plus a dd ticket even tho the dd didn't eat anything. They charged us full price for everything, even tho we paid in advanced. They didn't even ask us if we paid in advance. The production of this dinner was very poor. Very disappointed in everything. If they knew the system didn't differentiate between a reservation for that day or a reservation before that date they should ask about it. The pours where okay depending on who you got as the server. And the pizza was a slice of pizza for the main course. It is not a really 4 course meal. It is more of a sample of a 4 course meal.

29,Michelle L.,"Oxnard, CA",835,250,2676.0,3.0,2016-09-24,"Every single visit I've attended here with a large party, the service is horrible for dinner time. You're better off coming here for lunch or being at the bar. Here is my breakdown of my last experience & this is why I do not recommend this bar/restaurant for service purposes: Arrived at 7:45pm & sat with a party of 15. There were 4 of us that needed to order & not one single waitress or waiter came up to us until 8:30pm. That is a solid 45 minutes of wait time including 1 of one us went up front to ask for a waitress. Ordered our drinks & food & it was not served until 9:15pm. I wish I was over exaggerating but this wasn't the first time it has happened even if we reserved for a party.  * Service: 1-2 out of 5 stars. The waitress taking our orders was yelling as if she was demanding ""going once... going twice... gone"" type of attitude. If I could recommend the tall, skinny, Caucasian girl with black glasses I would prefer her enthusiastic attitude. I get it, we're a large party, but I wish it was handled better both timing & approach were bad. One of my other visits here we had to ask for the manager & she was sweet about our request. I don't know if staffing here is always short but they do not consistently check up on their tables as much as they should. We're simple customers that just wanted to eat & go, but if you're planning to be here for a ""short dinner"" for a good hour or so, expect the wait. * Drinks/Food: Other than the service, food is always a good 4 out of 5 stars. From beer on tap to appetizers to their main entrees, the portion sizes are shareable. Is the food worth the wait? To be honest, throughout the years when BJ's first opened this was one of Oxnard's top bar/restaurants for young adults. Nowadays, the service has gone downhill since. I wouldn't say ""worth"" the wait, but this type of ""wait"" is unnecessary for customer service with us being seated already. * Ordered: - BJ's Berry Burst Cider (5/5 stars): It's for breast cancer awareness month so it's on their ""pink drink"" list! It has a good fruity taste.  - Great White deep dish, small was good for 2 (4/5 stars): I like their deep dishes here. Fulfilling dish of carbs. - Crispy Portobello strips (4/5 stars): If you love mushrooms, this one is for you! It's basically mushroom fries but with deep fried batter & ranch.  From pastas to appetizers to pizookies, it's a ""decent"" dinner. Hence the 3 stars for A-okay. Could be better if it was served on a timely manner.  Again, if you're here for happy hour or a visit in general, I've gotten way better service for lunch time & for a smaller party.

73,K C.,"Camarillo, CA",2,17,2.0,1.0,2016-12-17,"I use to order take out from here somewhat frequently via online, every time I ordered I would ask for no onions and everytime I received onions all over my salad. When I would advise that I noted no onions, someone would give me an attitude saying I never did. The last time I took a photo of the sticker on the box that said ""no onions"" and the salad that had them all over. After having to remove all the onions, I filled out their online review. Never heard from the manager (she actually is one of the people who like to argue with me that I was wrong).   Everytime I pick up takeout, there are 4 or 5 employees standing around talking - no one acknowledges you or says that someone will be right with you. They let you sit there and wait until the take out person comes out. Most of the people who work there act like you crashed a private party and they want you gone. Only twice did I ever receive a smile or friendly interaction.  This last time though took the cake for me, I was rang up by the manager and tipped $2.00 on my take out order - which should have come to $18.15 with the tip. My card though was charged $21.99 someone changed the tip to 36%. When I called for an adjustment, the manager seemed to smirk, and actually laugh a little about why someone would be upset about it. She told me last Tuesday my card would be refunded - it's now Saturday and my bank has no record of a refund being processed back from BJs (so I'll just write corporate since they have such insufficient management). I'm sorry but whoever rang this up incorrectly, I believe did it thinking they wouldn't be caught because the amount was just an odd amount to charge. Hopefully, this isn't a habit they are doing - check your receipts.  In my call, I told the manager of my dissatisfaction with the service in a very assertive manner. She just said ""sorry I'll talk to them"". She should try leading by example, because she's walked past me plenty of times herself and never asked if someone was assisting me, spoken to me rudely when I asked why my meal had onions on it, and I've seen her huddled herself with that same group of employees standing around talking and ignoring the desk.

Best part is that you can always customize your meal with no expense unless you add extra of course. I think their quality of food is outstanding. I mean, you can tell it was made right of the oven or grill. Most of the food is on the ""clean"" side and not so greasy. I love how everything has its own unique flavor, because if you take an extra moment and reflect on some other restaurants dishes, some things taste the same. At Bj's, there's a huge difference from the steaks, to chicken, between the variety of salads, the pastas and most importantly, the pizzas and pizookies. Flavor is on point all the timeeeeee!  I advise you to order something different everytime you come back. Try something new. You won't be disappointed! I love trying new things and going out of my usual orders.  I definitely recommend the pizzas. They are absolutely one of a kind and you just have to try it out yourself if you haven't. They're stuffed with fresh toppings, the dough is thick, there isn't really a crust BUT the edges and outer dough has that perfect crunch you look for in a pizza.  Lastly, you MUST get a pizookie! There are so many flavors and all of them are insanely good. They recently added a chocolate mint one and I have yet to try it. My favorite is the classic chocolate chip, but the macadamia one has huge macadamia pieces that make the entire cookie amazing.

My visit was on a Sunday evening, mostly older people and families were there at this time. We were sat next to a table of overly loud people(pretty much at shouting volume). They had been drinking and were borderline drunk. Every other word they spoke was offensive, sexual in nature or profanity. This normally does not bother me but this was daytime hours when families were around. Tables surrounding them were visibly upset by this scene. The worst part of this was the mother at the table chugging her drink and describing sexually explicit acts while holding her infant.  When I was about to complain to a manager I watched him walk over to the table and sit with them and join in on the ""fun"". It was then I realized that two of the patrons were employees and were celebrating a birthday.

40,Kristiana R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-07-27,"Yesterday my husband and I came here for lunch around 2:30. Upon arrival, the male host was very kind and said he would check on a table for us and sat us within a few minutes. He explained the promotions they had going on and told us to enjoy our meal, and that was the best customer service we had during our stay. Our waitress was a heavyset woman who wore a lot of makeup, looked about 20-something, but had no name tag. She was very unprofessional and not as attentive as I would have liked. As I am a server myself, I know that sometimes serving is not easy when it is busy. However, the restaurant wasn't busy at all yet I felt like she was never around when we needed something. When we asked for something she did not stop at the table she just kept walking by, not leaving any time for us to even ask for everything we needed. She seemed hasty for no reason. A table nearby had been there for a while just talking, and she would constantly ask them if they needed anything else, as if she wanted them to leave already. It just revealed more of her character in that she does not care for the customers, only the money. As we left the restaurant, I regretted tipping her the small amount that I did because I found that she was standing in the front very casually and lazily and talking to the male host. This must have been where she was during the times we needed something! I was very disappointed because I have never had bad service here.  Aside from the mediocre service, the food was fantastic! Which was probably the only reason I tipped at all because I know other employees of the restaurant get tipped. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, bone-in root beer glazed wings for my husband, and a chicken ranch piadina with sweet potato fries for me, and a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert. Everything was delicious, though our server took a long time to bring us condiments such as ranch and ketchup.  I love BJ's and this will not be my last time going because the food is too good and the selection is so wide. However, I do not recommend this server and I do hope management can better train their employees to take better care of their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=40,2.84,2.59,2.76,2.6960000000000006,2.6899999999999995

4,Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",289,180,569.0,3.0,2017-08-15,"My husband & I are Whole Foods-Plant Based. The easiest to describe this to someone who doesn't know what that means is to say we are vegan & do not eat refined sugars, flours or use much oil in our foods.  When we go out, we look at the obvious dishes that are vegetarian & look at how we can make it vegan (omitting cheese, butter or eggs). Salads, chips with salsa or guacamole, pizza minus the meat & cheese, veggie burgers or just ordering sides as entrées is an option.  Prefacing our order, I told the waitress we were vegan. I asked if the avocado egg rolls, had any dairy & found out that there is cream cheese in the mixture, which is pre-made. So, there was no way to order them without cream cheese. We ordered the ""vegetarian pizza"", minus the cheese. The mushrooms & olives that come with it, to be placed on only half of the pizza, as my husband hates them & I love them.  My nephew had the kids personal pan pepperoni pizza.  We ordered the chips & guacamole.  The chips & guacamole came quickly. I was hungry & so was my husband, so we attacked that appetizer. I thought it was just me, but the guac was very bland. They served a very small container of salsa, and I kept mixing the guac with it. I told my husband, ""Is it me or is this guac very bland?"" He said its bland. He tips the bowl over & said, ""There is no tomato, garlic, jalapeño, cilantro or lime. It's just a smashed avocado in this bowl!"" I shook my head.  Guacamole isn't very hard to make. It doesn't require culinary genius. It's literally mash up of a few simple ingredients. Even a college student in a dorm room can do that. I looked at him & told him not to bother complaining. So we decided we'll just wait for the pizza.  My nephew got his kids pizza first. He loved it & said it was delicious. We waited a few more minutes & finally got ours only to find that THERE WAS CHEESE ALL OVER IT!!! The very first request we made was ignored. I think the staff needs to be educated as to what veganism is.  We let the server know that ours was with no cheese. He quickly took it back. The waitress didn't come to our table right away to apologize for it until a later. She stated that they did make a mistake & it had a rush on it.  We finally did receive our pizza, it had no cheese (hooray!), but it did have the olives & mushrooms all over. We decided not to say anything as we were starving. I told my husband we would just pick off the mushrooms & olives for him & I'd take them. Later when we got our check, the waitress informed us that they took the pizza off our bill because of the mistakes they made. And we appreciate that.  I've been a patron of this restaurant for however long it's been here in Oxnard, which is about 15 years. I have had many great meals, fun times, awesome drinks & even had a couple of birthday parties here. I have always had great service & the staff has always been very friendly & nice, so I won't stop coming here. They make an effort to make right, what mistakes they have made, but I will say this, in some respects the overall service has declined at BJs & not just at this location, a few weird things have happened at the Thousand Oaks/Westake location as well. I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at that BJs, and was disappointed by a few things. I will post my review for them under that stores Yelp page at another time.  The best thing to do to make sure any restaurant gets your order done correctly is to ask the waitress/waiter to read the order back to you to prevent mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard,2.96,2.59,2.764,2.8280000000000003,2.7379999999999995

They knew? He takes it away, and it took so long, my family either had to let their food get cold or eat without me, so I sat there for a while twiddling my thumbs like an idiot while my family enjoyed their meal. Eventually, my steak finally showed back up and the middle was cold. Refrigerator cold. Medium-rare is supposed to be just about room temp.

I had a little chips and salsa to go along with my ale and was watching an amazing that went to overtime. But i don't know if it had anything to do with Ashley going on break, but as i sat at the bar after ordering my tacos, i noticed that tow other customers came and sat down and received there food...and mine wasn't there. Disappointed...but the great game makes it okay...i just wonder if they have these issues when there isn't a game too, it might make for a poor experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard,2.92,2.7,2.784,,2.7880000000000003
