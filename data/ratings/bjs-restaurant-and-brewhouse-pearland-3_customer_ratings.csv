156,Sherry C.,"Houston, TX",90,231,148.0,4.0,2012-01-23,"My mom is a sucker for chain restaurants. She thinks Olive Garden is ""fancy Italian"". When she suggested BJ's for my aunt's bday dinner- I just went along with it. I looked up their menu online and saw they offered lighter options for their food & drinks.  Went with a party of 7 and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the grilled tilapia and my mom had the Honey Chicken Salad. The portions are huge- we shared both plates and we had half the salad left over. The fish was delicious served over rice, cooked to a perfect flakiness. The salad was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce so nothing exciting about that.  The high-light of my night was the Skinny Ritas. 130 calories each drink, they add a splash of orange juice and they make them strong. Not strong where you can't enjoy it- but strong enough to make you happy after one drink.  Service was good, she did forget my grandpa's roll & to refill my son's drink but she was nice and I was happy with my drinks so I didn't speak up about it. OH!! I am almost forgetting the 2nd best part- the strawberry beignet dessert. It was gone in 30 seconds flat. The 7 of us inhaled it...it was divine & sinfully good.  I hate to admit that I am fan of BJ's Brewhouse...I am- I guess my mom was right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=140,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.9280000000000004,3.6400000000000006

188,Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,3.0,2012-02-26,"I would have given it a solid 4 stars but the host staff was horrible. We arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night and was told the wait for 2 would be 15 min. Which surprised us because it was packed. So we decided to wait (initially we went to gringos and the wait was close to 2 hrs). After 15 min had passed my sister asked how much longer should we expect to wait and was told another 15 min. And we were ok with that because that's what we figured in the first place. 20 minutes later we walked over to the bar and asked a server if it was open seating, she said it was and we grabbed a table someone was just getting up from. It was almost 20 min after that when our buzzer finally let us know our table was ready. By that time we had drinks and our appetizers. There was no apology from the host staff about the 15 min wait that turned into over an hour even when it was mentioned. The host looked at me like she had no idea what I was saying.  Now on to the food and service. Our server was ally or abby (can't remember) She was really nice and helpful. Sister had the bruschetta and I had the snack size mac n cheese and garlic bread. It was amazing! The bread was perfectly cooked and she loved her bruschetta. And the mac but not so good the next day. We also each ordered pizzas (1/2 price during happy hour!!)  And though we weren't able to finish them (SO FULL) we did enjoy them and they warmed up nicely the next day in the oven! I'm willing to go back next time I visit. Probably not during such a busy time as their hostess staff clearly has no clue how to guesstimate wait times. There is quite a difference in 15 min vs over an hour!

My husband had a beer.  With about 1/3 left in the glass, the waiter came over and accidentally broke the glass on the table.  He cleaned it up and returned with a very small glass.  We asked ""what's this?"".  He said that since there was 1/3 of a beer in the glass, he was replacing it with the exact same amount.  Since he was very young we explained that common courtesy dictates that he should come back with a full glass of beer and an apology for spilling the beer and breaking a glass. The manager came over and said that he would only replace 1/3 of the beer, because ""We are trying to run a business"".  We explained that he would lose customers with this attitude and he stormed off. I have never heard of serving anyone 1/3 glass of beer.  It's not the missing beer that is the point, it is the rude attitude and customer service.   Needless to say, we will never go back to BJs and their 1/3 beer policy again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=140,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.8520000000000003,3.2400000000000007
142,Joey Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,8,,2.0,2012-08-13,"BJ's is known for its pizza. Ironically enough, the pizza tasted the worst and that's saying something considering the rest of the entrees. Everything was cold before it even hit the table. The fries were soggy and limp. And nothing about the meal was remarkable. Actually no, that's not true- the meal was remarkably disappointing.  Now our waitress was really sweet and nice, but I can't say the same for this other waitress. When my mom asked her for ketchup, she walked right by without stopping and blatantly ignored us. I understand that she's not the one serving us, but she didn't  have to be so rude. She could have acknowledged us and said, ""Your waitress will be with you in a moment."".

The kids love it here because they can be loud and noisy and no one cares. of course we have to make sure they are behaved and not breaking things and walking all over the place. WE HATE THAT!  Even though BJ's is know for thier pizza - i usually get the santa fe salad without the chicken and tomato basil soup.  hubby loves the pizza. the kids usually split an order of the mac and cheese from the kids menu(its huge portion and very very good)  sometimes if we are really hungry or with a large group we order apps and get the spinach dip and the avocado rolls to share amongst us and yes the pazookie is off the hook Never had a problem with the wait staff. always friendly and courteous,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=180,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.4440000000000004,3.2000000000000006
139,Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370.0,4.0,2012-12-16,"Wow, the Tai chicken mango salad ( which is new ) was awesome. Gaby was our waitress  and the service was good.  Let's start with a ""healthy"" portion of fried mozzarella sticks, kiddos ( and the big kids too) loved them. Since I started my lunch off on clearly the right foot, I choose to get one of their salads. I went new and I hope it sticks. Great combo of spice with the Tai chicken, and add sweet topical mango to off set the spice, very well done BJs. The greens, not to be left out were just as fresh and crisp. My wife had their Santa Fe salad and she too had a similar experience of greatness. The kids had sliders, which my son enjoyed and my growing teen, she went buffalo boneless wings, her thought was a tad spice for her, but that's her palate. I tried and for spice lovers such as myself, they were just fine. On tap, they have a nice variety of specialty micro brews, I tried this visit their Irish red, I'd give it 4 out of 5, Murphy's Irish red and Killians are still both better brews in my opinion. For beer lovers and kill a gift or two, but $50 Gift card and get a free beer glass, better off buy $100 gift card and get a set of 4 beer glasses. Cool, but I collect beer glasses, I love this promo.

102,Corey W.,"Pearland, TX",934,168,391.0,4.0,2013-03-10,"Their Pizza is always good. They now have regular hand tossed crust in addition to their deep dish. I've tried both, but give the edge to the latter as I think it's more satisfying and  I like the atmosphere at this BJ's, no matter how many patrons are there, it never feels crowded and the seating area is far enough spaced apart to where you are not sitting in the next table's lap.  As for the bar, its not my first choice to watch a game as BJ's is more of a family eatery. The screens are only in the bar area and very high up so that you will have to strain your neck to watch, but that's okay, I'll travel to BW3 if I am looking  to drink beers and watch a continuous loop of games with the guys.  Outside of pizza, their dishes can be a hit or a hit or a miss. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, ORDER THEIR SPAGHETTI!  The turkey burger is above average as are their wings and wraps. The pizzooki is one of my favorite deserts anywhere, others (Champp's and Cheddar's) have unsuccessfully tried to imitate the freshly made cookie topped with ice cream, but to no avail.  Their proprietary beers are usually pretty good,(I prefer the light switch lager) but I'm not sure that they are still brewed in house.  Overall I like BJ's, especially this one.

We put in a reservation but the hostess said the app wasn't transmitting anything to the restaurant - so what's the point? However they did have a hostess passing around pizza bites and they did get us seated within 10 minutes. It took a LONG time for our server to even come for our drink order; by the time he came we were ready to order our meal (which seemed to fluster our server).  It took 30 minutes for our salads to come - seemed especially slow tonight! Then there are the little things - our menus stayed on the table the whole time, we had to ask for every drink refill EVERY time, and it took 15 minutes of waiting for the condiments to come after our burger was served. The burger and kids pasta were meh - not terrible but wouldn't likely reorder them. That being said, we loved the Pizookies, the pear and walnut salad, and the deep dish pizza. The Hefeweizen beer was especially good! :-). It is a fairly good place for kids - especially older school aged ones. Good portions for them!!

Sadly, the menu choices have been reduced except for the three ""B""s"" (beer, burgers and bar food). When we ordered the fairly expensive ""special"", we found the food to be overcooked (fish was dried out and steak well done instead of medium rare) and the veggies to be undercooked and nearly raw. The food arrived cold and the waitstaff forgot to bring the special dinner salads. I finally captured our waiter long enough to ask about the salads, and ended up putting them in ""To Go"" boxes.Once we started in on the meal, I found the steak to be overdone, tough, uncuttable and basically inedible. My wife's fish selection was overdone and inedible. I tried the secondary scallop dish and mine tasted very ""fishy"" indicating to me the scallops certainly were not (to put it kindly) not fresh. We complained to the server and finally the manager, who to his credit, gave us 50% off a different selection. At this point, we just chose ""bar food"" flat bread pizza appetizers and unboxed the salads which we found to be sparsely populated  and expensive for what we received. Appetizer pizza was OK, made with some sort of cracker like material, not a made to order crust like they did, at least to my recollection, several years ago.

BJ's is certainly a good dining spot for solo or family dining or a bar joint for sporting events, but I think this restaurant definitely shines as a top spot to plan a flawless group dinner!

It's also kind of hard to get in and out in one hour. We're usually late to work if we eat here. The soup and salad is always good. The bread is a tad too toasted for my liking so I usually skip that. The cheddar soup and the chili are my favorite. I always get the wedge salad with that also because I love blue cheese and bacon. Who doesn't love blue cheese and bacon?  The Cobb salad was my favorite thing they served here but they got rid of it! I was bummed when the waiter told me that. Ive tried the Chicken Caesar salad was ok, they were heavy with the dressing. A little too tangy in my opinion. Theyre watermelon and cheese Starter salad. It could have used more of the feta and less onions.  The Asian chicken salad was ok. The portion was a little small though and the chicken was dry. It was loaded with fried wonton, I could have used more greens and less of the fried stuff. The Mediterranean chicken tacos were very good. I was quite impressed with how well they tasted.

I called about a week and a half before hand and made reservation and asked if we could sit in a quiet area, specifically the back right side of the restaurant (I had been here several times before and knew this was the most quiet area). When we got to the restaurant they had a huge table with menu's, silverware and water waiting for our whole party. Our waitress was extremely attentive and was running around like she was running a marathon (and she was preggers!!). We ordered a few of the appetizers that had a little bit of everything on it and they came right out and it was all so good, we then turned around and ordered the fried calamari and it came out minutes later and it was fresh as could be! When it came time to order lunch our waitress had the whole menu memorized and was able to answer all questions we had about it. Of course I had to be the most difficult one and asked about the cobb salad that used to be on the menu, she said that they no longer had the turkey or the dressing but said that she could have it ordered if I didn't mind the no turkey or dressing. So I ordered the cobb salad with light ranch and blacked salmon, and OH MY GOSH it's still the best salad ever! Of course you cannot go wrong with ""BJ's freshly brewed root beer"" (St. Arnold's) with any meal. Two of our staff members had their Birthday's recently, the waitress had overheard this and brought them both Pazooki's with candles! Seriously, how sweet is that!??!

The last time we ate at a BJs was in Chino, CA and let me tell you... As soon as we saw there was a BJs we went for dinner that night. We love this place. Probably one of our most favorite restaurants! The menu can reach everybody's palates, it's huge. Only downside to that is it takes more time to order because there is so much to choose from. We started off with a couple drinks, they weren't very strong and I admit... I like my drinks a little stronger. Only complaint I have about our dinner. For apps we had spinach stuffed mushrooms and the avocado egg roll. Awesomeness! The avacado egg roll had cream cheese in it and were a little spicy which I loved and the spinach stuffed mushrooms were a good starter size for two people. This was just the beginning. Ordered another round of drinks this time tall ones! My gf had the sirloin with mashed potatoes and asparagus while I had the portobello Swiss burger. One thing is for sure they always nail how to cook a sirloin at this place. Even at the other location in Chino, CA. My burger was amazing! It came with thin cut French fries and was more than enough food . Let's just say we made two meals after eating our left overs the next day.  Service was great, atmosphere is amazing; I love how clean and new this place is, the style and space of the restaurant is perfect and a great place to eat.

It was the best combo.  I could get that or a baked potato. Then they changed the menu.  I loved the chicken limone pasta.  Then they changed the menu.  Again. Calm down, BJs!  Last night we stopped by after watching The Force Awakens and they were packed but we got in quickly.  +1 point.  I ordered a black and blue and they had no idea what that was.  Come on!  Seriously? They call it Dark side of the moon.  -1 point The kids wanted mozzarella sticks which have been perfect in the past.  Never had any issues before but tonight they were practically cold and crumbly. They were pathetic.  I can get better cheese sticks from Sonic for a heck of a lot cheaper.  -1 point I was craving one of their deep dish pizzas despite the fact that they killed my cheeseburger pizza. It tasted good but came out 5 minutes before everyone else's food.  So I just say there with a pizza in front of me because I want going to eat in front of everyone.  Not cool,  Bjs. -1 for delivery, +1 for taste I will tell you that they have AMAZING beer dinners occasionally where the beer keeps flowing.  I actually have to ask them to stop serving me because I get so toasty. All for $35 and a six course meal.

We were seated promptly by a nice hosting staff.  Food: we shared a small vegetarian deep dish pizza, with italian sausage added to one side. It had a lot of cheese and enough veggies. My only complaint? It was very dry even with all that cheese. I don't think it has any tomato sauce at all. The cheese and veggies weren't enough to give it any impressive flavour.  Service staff: our lady server was friendly, only I think she was busy, I think. We were left waiting around for her most of the time. It took 10 minutes between getting the check, another 10 for her to pick it back up, etc.  Atmosphere: it's a brewhouse, much like a TGIF's, you get the loud crowd so it doesn't make much for a close setting unless you're ok with that.

As soon as I cut into the chicken it felt off. I kept having to check with each bite that it was cooked. It almost seemed to have a skin on it. It didn't taste bad, but quality seemed poor. My fiancé got the grilled chicken club. It kept falling apart, which he attributed to the avocado, and he too made a statement that it seemed that his chicken wasn't  cooked right, almost like it was just boiled.

I came in a group of six and this was during the UH Cougars and OU Sooners football game, so of course I wanted to watch it. Told the hostess to seat us where we (specifically me) could watch the game. We were told to wait about five minutes and then we were seated at the corner booth on the right side (if you're looking in) of the restaurant. Not in the main floor where there are TVs all over the place, but in the restaurant wing where's there's only three TVs in the whole room. If that's not bad enough, in the middle of the booth, between my eyes and the TV, there's a hanging chandelier that made it really hard for me to watch the game. Yes, there are other TVs in other sides of the restaurant, but these TVs aren't big enough for me to be able to see the score, or to see what the hell is going on during the game. Enough rant! On to the food and service!! Food: I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger. The patty - bland. Totally flavorless like they didn't put anything on the patty - just slab the meat on the grill, put it on the bun, add bacon and vegges, and done! Meh. Service - Our waiter was okay. Not great, not fast, not super slow either. However, prior to use leaving, one of my friends asked for his drink to go. THIS never happened. We waited a little bit after we all signed our CC checks to see if he'd come back, but nope. I even got up and looked around to see if I could located him somewhere in the restaurant, but he was nowhere to be found either. Meh. As I stated above, my experience was underwhelming. Bland food and meh service.  So... meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,2.96,3.5,3.5,2.9520000000000004,3.2840000000000003

50,Karen L.,"Pearland, TX",300,44,32.0,4.0,2016-10-03,"I've been here multiple times so I thought it was finally time for a review. After recently moving to Pearland, TX from Upstate NY, I've noticed this restaurant is a town staple. I've gotten to try assorted things on the menu- the California pizza, calamari, Brussels sprouts appetizers, jambalaya pasta entree, and a couple of their burgers. The food is average to mediocre. The pasta lacked flavor and I would not get it again. I expected more from the burgers. Both times I ordered it medium and it was quite well done, no pink in it at all. Most recently I got the burger with bacon and BBQ sauce and that lacked flavor despite the bacon. The Brussels sprouts were seasoned well and mostly tasty, but some pieces were charred and unpleasant. The ambience inside is 5/5 for watching sports or having group meals. Lastly, the pizookies are to die for. I've tried almost all of the flavors, ***salted caramel is my favorite. Service is a hit or miss depending on who you get, independent of the time or day you go. Overall, with a 3/5 for average food and 5/5 due to dessert, I give this place a 4/5. I'll definitely come back again if I get a sweets craving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=40,2.96,3.51,3.51,2.9600000000000004,3.29

My girlfriend had to get up out of her seat to go had my card to the bartender who eventually found her.

Because we were trying to have a lunch meeting, we opted out of leaving this place. Every so often, we were told that they were getting our tables ready, but to no avail.  We were finally seated and served. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, but it was nothing amazing. I think the long wait really dampened our experience. We were hungry and frustrated.  I'm giving 2 stars, because the Chocolate Chunk Mini Pazookie was really good and filling.  The service could be much better. I asked our waiter for utensils, and he kept forgetting.

I don't eat vegan, but people that tried their Lemon Chicken Entrée, said it was delicious.Their kids meals are a bit on the high end pricing compared to other restaurants, but I would say that the kids meals portion is at least fair. Love the restaurant's ambiance. Modern decoration, spacious and clean. Their staff Is always friendly. The only thing that made me give it a 4 stars vs a 5 stars is the fact that waiters and waitresses tend to either come or forget about you LOL And another thing, I believe that whatever drink that has complimentary refill should always be refilled without a customer to have to wait to order it. Their curbside ordering is nice. You can order from the comfort of your home, and if like me it's a hassle to take kids down to go pick -up your order, it's nice that they have assigned parking spots where you park, dial the number on the sign and they get your order within minutes.

The burgers came back later and were probably over cooked to medium-well instead of medium to compensate for the 1st issue of them being raw.

2,Rosy P.,"Houston, TX",14,176,2453.0,5.0,2017-09-24,"This is one of the few restaurants open late in Pearland. They're famous for their Pizookies and rightly so. Those cookie desserts are awesome! My favorite is the triple chocolate with Ghirardelli pizookie. It's so good!!! I ventured out and tried the Cookies and Cream pizookie today and it just didn't compare.  There are a wide variety of entrees here. The burgers are good. So is the pizza. Their artichoke and spinach dip is cheesy, melty goodness. The soups are served in bread bowls - my husbands favorite! They have specials Monday thru Thursday's.  Their kids menu is full of variety also. Lots to choose from for even the pickiest eater. If you get a waiter/waitress that's really good, your kid also gets the kids appetizer - a small fruit cup and bread roll. Sometimes we get it, sometimes we don't. Today we did and my son was happy about that!  Decor is nice and simple. The atmosphere is lively but not too distracting. Good food. Good people. It's easy to see why they have repeat business here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.56,3.42,3.42,,3.4760000000000004

12,Maddison A.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",153,12,10.0,5.0,2017-10-07,"So a friend and I went to BJ's on a Thursday and got the 1/2 rack rib special with two sides and a salad. Both of our meals were exceptional. She got the ribs with fresh green beans and white cheddar mashed potatoes with a Caesar salad. I had the same ribs with fresh green beans and sweet potato fries with a tomato and mozzarella salad. Let me say this... the mozzarella so fresh that even days later as I eat my left overs, I can still taste the freshness of the cheese. I have frequented BJ's plenty of times throughout the years and I just wanted to give credit where credit is due. Sorry no pics because the food was so yummy that I forgot to capture this moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.64,3.43,3.43,,3.5140000000000002
10,Kayte S.,"Alvin, TX",2,1,1.0,1.0,2017-10-19,"Was craving avocado egg rolls to take home for lunch, I ordered that along with a cookies n cream pzookie since they were only $3. Half way through eating the egg rolls at home noticed some of my egg rolls burnt which the first half wasn't that great at all either. Saved the pzookie for a few hours later and opened it up to the sad excuse of a cookie don't even think it was cooked all the way. BJ's has always been my go to restaurant when I can't decide... But today was the absolute worst experience for take out and quality/taste of food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.56,3.39,3.39,,3.458
19,Tom M.,"Pearland, TX",32,67,6.0,1.0,2017-10-23,We hadn't been her in a while so we decided it would be something different and it was. Everything from the service to the food was bad. My wife ordered a Jalapeño burger and onion petals and I ordered a BJ's pizza. We also ordered two margaritas as they were $5 tonight. We waited about twenty minutes before they arrived. There was no salt on the rim and when my wife inquired the sever told us that the margaritas on special did not include salt. She then told us she would bring us glasses with salt and she did. Upon tasting the margaritas they were not very good to the point I didn't drink mine at all. The food arrived and my  pizza was luke warm where I could even hold the pan. My wife's burger was also barely warm and the onion straws were cold. At this point we didn't want to send anything back as we were tired and just wanted to go home. I have two daughters that are servers so I always tip well for good service and adequate for bad service. I can't say I'll return to BJ's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.44,3.37,3.37,,3.398
1,Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2206.0,4.0,2017-11-02,"Met some friends here for lunch, I had been to a few BJ's locations but never this one. I had also never tried their pizza.  I went with the Gourmet Five Meat deep dish. This was a serious pizza! Two pieces and I was done. I was able to make four meals out of the one pizza, which was good because at $26.25 it was the most expensive pizza I've ever had. Worth it thou.  They brought out a three prong pizza stand for the table and it had magnets on it and the pizza pan was metal...genius! I am always worried about the entire pizza sliding off those, but this one was going no where.   Also had a Cream Soda which was fantastic.  As we were leaving the manager told us that pizzas are half off on Mondays, just might have to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.4,3.37,3.37,,3.382

It is only about six minutes from my house...well, anyway I know now. They make their own beer! I tried a few and really liked one-Jeremiah Red. The burgers and pizzas were spot on too. This is a good place to go if you have older kids or just want to hang out with a few friends for a couple (OK, a few) beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3,3.28,3.36,3.36,,3.3280000000000003
