350,Stephanie S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,8,,5.0,2012-01-03,"Our server was Tara, she was great, very attentive. The food was excellent, we got the best beginnings as an appetizer, it had a little of everything, two types of egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, chips and dip. The appetizer did such a good job of filling us up that each one of us took home leftovers. We ordered the jambalaya which was true to its form with rice. My husband was happy with the black and blue burger, and I had the blonde shrimp, which were a little over-done - but still good. The drinks were delicious. My friend and I both had the BJ's Irish Root beer - we will definitely get these again. My husband tried a couple different brews, he liked the Oktoberfest the best. The restaurant is extremely popular and usually has a wait. They encourage you to call ahead and put your name on the wait list. We got there expecting a wait, so it didn't dampen our mood, which was good because our wait was longer than quoted. All in all we had good food and good service and will be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=420,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.2840000000000003,3.2800000000000002

I have gone twice to this place and each time they have had an hour wait.  Mind you I have NEVER gone on a Friday or Saturday.  The last time I went was on a Monday night.  An hour wait on a Monday night is overkill.  When we asked why they had an hour wait when all the tables outside were empty we were told it was because they were understaffed.   Needless to say, we did not wait and honestly I have given up on this place all together.  GET IT TOGETHER BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=280,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.8200000000000003,3.2400000000000007

254,Tara B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1085,48,70.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"After driving by BJ's daily and avoiding it mainly because at night it looks like a mad house with packed parking lot and line out the door (and I soooo hate waiting in line forever) I did stop in the afternoon with my kids and there was next to nobody in there! It was PERFECT for me! No crowd, no noise, no line, no waiting! They have lunch specials until 3 pm Of course it was right after 3 when we got there! Server was great, fun, personality and extremely attentive to our needs. If you drink, they have like 6 pages of beer/wine in the menu. The desserts are made at the time of order and are yummmy. See some of the pics I'm going to upload of the Pizookie Trio dessert along with calamari which was lightly breaded and not oily, greasy like other places. The dipping sauces were perfect. My son had the cajun pasta and thought they over seasoned it though, all he could taste was the seasoning and the chicken was bit dry. My daughter had the jambalaya and pretty much same thing...over seasoned, but still decent. I had the overstuffed potato with chicken & broccoli with alfredo sauce and it was the biggest danged potato I've ever seen. We eyed a few other things we would like to try so we'll be going back... but not during the dinner/weekend rush though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=240,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.9560000000000004,3.2400000000000007
394,Larry L.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,15,,2.0,2012-01-31,"Made curious by the packed lot at lunch time, my wife and I sneaked in for an early dinner at 5:15 on a Saturday.  The lot was still packed, but we got a table for 2 after a 5-minute wait.  Most of the multi-page menu is devoited to beer, cocktails, and wine.  The food listings are difficult to make out, so I had to borrow my wife's spectacles to read them.   Here goes: Beers:  excellent, priced more than domestics. Margherita Fresca flatbrea pizza:  it had some good flavor, but there were few discernible toppings.  It looked naked compared to this chain's online photo.  JUST O.K. Chicken Lettuce Wraps:  bit of chicken and other ingredients, supposedly including water chestnuts and mushrooms, but I could not tell.  Certainly, no crispy won-tons on top.  Plenty of lettuce leaves, though.  My screwup -- I didn't read that the white sauce was Chinese horseradish mustard and poured some on the first wrap.  (Ruined it.)  JUST O.K.  Piranha Pale Ale Nachos:  worst nachos I ever had.  All we kept scooping up was chili-flavored beans.  DON'T DO IT When we left at about 6, there were a whole bunch of people outside, pagers in hand, waiting for tables.  Summary:  A good place to go with friends for drinking and socializing, and for large portions of mediocre food.   Every sports bar I've been to serves better grub than this.  Maybe if we had ordered burgers.... I'll make a side trip back to try the deep-dish pizza and see how it compares to Chicago style, but for nothing else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=400,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.8880000000000003,3.2000000000000006

375,Raymond M.,"Hollywood, FL",52,41,28.0,3.0,2012-02-16,"I have eaten here a couple of time already, and we know that during the weekends forget about getting a table with less that a 45 minute wait.  It is just packed to the rafters.  But when you come during the week, sans Friday and the weekend, you will find a table quickly.  My wife and I are wishing the best for this restaurant, but I have to admit that after 4 times each time there was an issue of some sort with the food.  On the first week that it opened my wife ""pork chops"" were very under cooked as you got closer to the bone, we brought it up to the attention of the manager and we hoped that it was corrected.  So we waited for couple of weeks allowing for the restaurant to adjust a bit to the menu and we came back  and low and behold when was enjoying my Chicken Marsala I started to notice that the taste was changing and found out that my chicken was under cooked showed it to the waiter and the manager came around and made the apologies and explained to him to have the cook to take his time in cooking the chicken.  Now we come to last night (2/15/2012) and we held out breath giving it another chance.  We love to explore with new items and we ordered the Meatballs (fantastic), the ""Chicken Wantons"" (excellent especially good with the white and read sauces that came with it) , and the Mozzarella and tomato balsamic salad was cold and crispy.  The disappointment, the Mac and cheese, had to send it back twice since it was Mac and cheese soup.  They were telling us that it has to set up, understandable, but when you make the sauce and take it off the stove and you let it set, and when it sets it sticks to the macaroni when it cools down a bit and not swim it it.  We again brought it up to the Manager's attention and he recognized us from the other times that we came to dine there. The beer is great especially the Jeremiah Red and the building and the restaurant space is nice, but they have to spend more money to attract a better chef that will take his or her time and making sure that the meals come out right, and is not in a rush to get the orders out fast.   I guarantee that if the food is good and comes out well paced (not bring out the starters with the dinner or, ""ish"", warm salad).  Take the time to provide good service and food then the people will be glad to wait for a table. Will we come back, maybe.  How long dos BJ's have to brew to get it right with the food and service?  We just don't know, a year, two years, three years?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=320,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.8600000000000003,3.2400000000000007

The foods good, large potions even in appetizers so if your going with a group of friends you can order appetizers between all of you. Great tv's everywhere so if you want to watch a game its awesome and the best will have to be their poozoki deserts.

I had their piranha beer which was really good. For appetizers we had chicken avocado rolls and stuffed mushrooms both were really good... For dinner we had mediterranean deep dish pizza which was salty... Chicken alfredo pasta was average... And Parmesan crusted chicken which was good....

My favorite of their Chicken Alfredo Pasta its so delicious and creamy.  The bread that accompanies it is so soft . I absolutely love their 1800 skinny margaritas. All that taste for half the calories!  It can get very busy and waiting for a table on the weekends is a serious pain but good thing is that the bar is always open so you can grab a drink while you wait. The service here is really good, I've never had a problem with the staff, everyone is usually very friendly and patient. If you are undecided on what to try they will make suggestions for you.  For your first time I recommend trying one of their deep dish pizza's, they're a real treat. If you don't drink they make their own colas, the black cherry is my favorite.

283,Esther B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",344,331,,5.0,2012-04-04,"I love this place! So totally Cali.  It was one of those ""clueless where to go for dinner"" nights. The strategy: just drive. The requirements: someplace I haven't Yelped yet. BJ'S let's try that. Hubby immediately agrees. Wonder why?  Driving up I'm thinking this is gonna be three stars (yelping begins in the parking lot now). But wait, this place looks pretty cool. Walking in...maybe this will be a 4 if the great taste in decor carries into the menu. Checking out the menu...OMG I want everything!  We ordered 3 small plates: 1. Tuna Poke. Amazing, fresh, simple yet absolutely delicious. Ordering this again for sure whenever I come here! Cubed tuna and avocados over a bed of cabbage slaw, with the most delicious light and zesty sauce that was barely there, but oh so perfect. This was served with some flaky, cracker type ummm...thingies (thingies=I can't describe these) that were just the right texture. 2. Meatballs. This tapas style dish, along with several others in this section of the menu are small and inexpensive, which is great if you're into menu sampling and want to try a few things. Great flavor. Nice dish. 3. Fried artichokes. An old favorite, done better than most other places. I'm guessing bread crumbs were Panko, but they were seasoned, so you had crunch AND flavor. I love adding lemon to artichokes, but the sauce they served it with was nice and light and pretty good. Another winning dish makes the score three for three. Outside seating is great. Large, covered patio. They don't take reservations, but they do have call ahead seating. Mid-week visit was no wait, but I understand weekends are a completely different story, so CALL.   The menu here is pages long (a la Cheesecake Factory), varied, and inventive. Deep dish pizza is a house specialty. So is their famous dessert called ""pizookie"". Can't wait to try both and write an update.

I said I was torn between than and my old stand-by, French dip. He advised to go with the pot roast, so I did. The roast itself was tasty but so small compared to the huge mound of mashed potato. But what really was horrible were the veggies. The carrots, celery and onion were raw. I only know this after eating the onion. It was so strong that it left my pallet unable to taste anything else.  When I brought this to his attention he offered to get me the French dip and said he'd have it out I'm less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, still no sandwich and my husband and 3 year old have long finished theirs. I asked Ben to have it wrapped to go. Another 10 minutes later it arrived. I did eat it later that afternoon for dinner but reheated sandwiches are not my fave.

We also ordered the ribs which were far from tender.  In spite of this, I paid the full bill because I did not want to get into everything that they had done wrong and just wanted to get out of there at that point.  We also had dirty flatware in our roll up and then again when they brought the dessert.  Someone actually had to pick up a dirty spoon and place it on the plate!

As a Sports Bar and hangout spot, 4 stars seem fair. The hostess up front had a generally pleasant attitude, and the bartender did engage in some friendly college football trash talk.  The food though is where my experience goes to a ""4th and long"" situation. I will say that drink service was pretty on point but I'm chalking that up more to the service points. Being probably the only fan of Hawaiian Pizza in Miami, I ordered their personal size ""Sweet Pig"" pizza. A week out from having dined there, the only thing that stands out, that comes to mind is that the consistency reminded me of school cafeteria pizza. Come on, you remember the geometric, doughy one right? Heavier on the cheese than sauce? Coming back now?  To be a little more diplomatic, it's almost like a pan pizza.

I recommend ordering a flight, aka sampler, which consists of 8 healthy sized samples and choosing your own personal favorites.   As for the food, everything ordered in my party was eaten with gusto. I myself had the  Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. Not the healthy minded fair I usually order but  chili made with beer poured over a 1/2 pound burger served open faced.

193,Jo W.,"Miami, FL",176,335,1441.0,3.0,2013-01-23,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is the classic beer and pizza joint hidden in a casual dining restaurant chain. All in all, it is a pretty good place for an outing with friends or family. On tap, they have a selection of handcrafted micro brews. I am not the beer lover, so I passed, but my boyfriend tried their Tatonka Stout. It wasn't bad but  ti didn't really stand out either. He wasn't impressed but it could have just been a matter of preference. If you only came here for a few drinks with friends and aren't looking to eat a big meal, BJ's has a bunch of snacks and small bites! We decided to try the Thai Style Chicken Wontons. The were right out of the fryer and steaming hot. They were very light and crispy. The filling was well seasoned and delicioso! I loved it. They are basically known for their deep dish pizzas so if its your first time here, I recommend you try one. We had the Spicy Meatball which consisted of housemade meatballs, spicy tomato sauce, Italian sausage, jalapenos, Parmesan cheese and red onions.  It was scrumptious! Fresh, cheesy, crunchy crust and yummy! The only thing is I wouldn't label it a deep dish but rather a pan pizza. Even if you don't drink beer or for some odd reason don't enjoy pizza, you might want to still consider BJ's for their famous Pizookie. Imagine this, a freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Mmmm!!! I had to go with the Chocolate Chunk for the melty chocolate goodness, but they have other options and a trio sampler if you can't decide. It seems that they pride themselves on providing a quality experience. Our waiter was really nice and funny. He cracked a few jokes with us and made us laugh. However, although the entertainment factor was high, in actual performance he lacked. There were a few times we were left waiting and we had to ask for water refills. It go to a point where we had to ask another waiter. So, I see where they are going with the experience they seek to provide, but it needs improvement. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience and recommend you come. However, the restaurant does get packed at times and they don't take reservations, so I suggest that you call ahead for the wait time and put your name on the waiting list if necessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=200,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.9240000000000004,2.96
376,Sara M.,"Washington, DC",512,357,36.0,2.0,2013-01-28,"I wavered between 2 and 3 stars on this one, I just didn't think BJ's was a good as I thought it would be. I don't know if my expectations were too high or perhaps they were just having an off night, not sure.   I came here for dinner with my family on Sunday night where we called ahead since they don't take reservations. When we got there around 7:30pm, we still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table and it seemed the regular wait time was about double that. Fine, no big.  After we were seated, it took about 5 minutes for our waitress to make it to our table for drink orders. I was very tempted by their drink menu. Not only do they have some really good looking beers which they brew themselves (hence the name BJ's Brewhouse) but they also had layered beers and ciders which were calling my name, not to mention house made sodas. Alas, I stuck with water, but my brother in law ordered a beer and my sister ordered the creme soda, so at least I would get to sample.  My brother in law's beer came out first, delivered by a different waiter, and then the rest of the drinks took about 10 minutes to make it to the table which is way too long.  When it came to placing my order there was a bunch of items on the menu that looked good to me. They just about cover the board with their options, from salads to burgers to sandwiches, and their specialty- pizza. Prices are mid range, about $14 for a salad, $11ish for sandwiches, etc. I settled on the crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either thin cut fries or potato wedges, I got the wedges. My mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich and then was told that they were out which was a bummer for her since that is one of her faves. I really have to question when a restaurant of this size runs out of something. Maybe they couldn't handle the extra demand that stemmed from the Chili Cookoff which was that day, but again, management should have planned better for it.  Anyhow, after orders were placed and drinks were delivered, we waited about 20 minutes when our waitress came by and asked us how everything was. We all kind of stared at her with blank faces.. ""uuum, the water is good..?"" We had yet to see our food and wouldn't for about another 15 minutes. I've had worse wait times for food, but 35 minutes is too long for this kind of place. My mom's food came out first, she subbed the pulled port for a brisket sandwich, which apparently didn't come with any sides. No one else's food came out for a good 5 minutes following which is one of my personal taboos.  My crispy chicken sandwich was just okay. It was not a chicken breast like I was expecting, but rather two sandwiches, each which had a chicken finger in the middle. It was okay, but somewhat dry. The wedges were good though, not as good as the magicalness of KFC potato wedges, but tasty. On top of my mom's food coming out before anyone else's, there were a few other small mishaps: When I ordered my sandwich, I asked to replace the honeymustard with ranch, which was not there when my food was delivered. Also, my sister ordered the thin cut fries with her meal and received wedges instead. The veggies on my mom's plate were raw- raw onions, carrots and celery. really? raw onion? My sister really enjoyed her chili burger which was HUGE and my brother in law said his spicy meatball pizza was good but very very spicy. I also sipped my sister's creme soda, orange/creme soda and the black cherry. The orange was a bit strange and we all agreed it left a funny taste in our mouths. The black cherry and creme soda were both really good.  If the food here was better, I would have probably given them 3 stars. Yes, the service stunk and was slow, but it could have just been our waitress and the rest of the team could be stellar, who knows? The best chance of me coming back to this place would be to sit at the (fully stocked) bar and grab a drink, but I don't think I'll be revisiting for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=320,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8560000000000003,2.92

There is a bar area with high top tables and booths where you can seat yourself (if there's availability) so we decided to do that instead of the 25-30 minute wait for two. Our server did a good job explaining the concept of the restaurant and the different beers they are known for. The menu is EXTENSIVE and everything is reasonably priced so it took a while to make a decision. I settled on the deep dish pizza and the Mr. got the pot roast. We also got a root beer which is apparently made there... And is freaking awesome, and much to our surprise had free refills. My pizza was good, reminded me of the personal pan pizzas at Pizza Hut. For more than half the price I will probably not order it from here again but am sufficiently intrigued to return and try something else. Agree with another review that it came out lukewarm. The pot roast meat was tender and the gravy had a robust flavor. Mashed potatoes were pretty good, dense because of the white cheddar. Also on the plate appeared to be raw celery, carrots and a quarter of an onion which I would expect to have been cooked WITH the roast so a little bizarre that they're there raw on the plate. Overall service was good, drinks refilled in a timely manner and just the right amount of checking in. I will definitely return.

This place is new to Coral Springs, so it is still pretty consistently busy, and a pretty consistent wait, so this was my first time visiting. We went on a Sunday for an early lunch, and did not need to wait too long! Our group had several special considerations, like a gluten-sensitivity, and an extremely picky youngster. Our server, Jamal (I think), was fantastic! He was super-helpful and catered to all of our odd requests without any trace of irritation, and really went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy with their food and their beverages. It was probably the best service I have received in the area from a restaurant that did not fall into the high-end category (think The Capital Grille).  The drink selection was fantastic! The handcrafted root beer was the best I had tasted in a long time. My daughter had the orange cream soda, and it was perfect. If you are a beer fan, the selection of BJ's craft beers well worth the visit. The Jeremiah Red was excellent, even though I am more of a stout drinker. I had the P.M. Porter, and was blown away! It was porter-perfection... The food was delicious. I am picky about Cesar salads, especially the dressing. The dressing was perfect here! They used just enough to accent, and did not drown the salad in it. I had the chicken in mine, and it was delicious and juicy. A friend let me taste the Cesar with seared rare ahi tuna, and it was possibly better than the chicken. The gluten-free pizza came with a choice of toppings (per their menu, any of their many ""classic"" pizza toppings except their housemade meatballs are gluten-free!) and my daughter had blackened chicken on hers, and loved it! My other daughter was a fan of the classic burger, and the youngest member of the group loved the Mini Corn Dogs!  In all, I was quite impressed with BJs.

Me, not so much. :P  He can taste the flavors, all i taste is beer. So i wanted to come here and have a bit to eat and have him sample some of their in house made beers. It was pretty busy, so we had to wait, but not too long. I got myself a fruity mixed drink, while hubby had a beer, that he LOVED.  I love the small appetizers. I tend to get full off appetizers before my meal comes, but this portion prevents that lol.  I had the french dip, honey had a burger. Both were tasty. One thing i wasn't happy with was the fries. They came out really cold. I didn't bother asking for more. I was hoping they would have sweet potato fries, but no suck luck.

Now I remember. I've been here 2x previously when they first opened. Food was meh- nothing to write home about and tonight was most certainly the case. We decided to give them another try just to see if things improved. We started out with the berry cider and a Long Island. Had to send back the long island because it was too sour and tasted like juice. Berry cider was ok, not the best cider I've had. We know that they are famous for their pizza and we've had it before so we wanted to try something different so we got the Hawaiian mahi and the pot roast. Bad idea. First of all, our server was very friendly but truthfully service was way to slow for a weds night. When the food finally came out, it looked pretty disappointing. The mahi had no flavor what so ever, there were charred bits from the dirty stove and the whole dish was bland and unappetizing. The pot roast was too saucy and salty. The only good part about that dish was the mash potatoes.  Worst of all, I had found a little hair on my fish!!! Ok so we were pretty much done with the meal when we saw the bill, close to fifty dollars for 2 drinks and 2 disgusting dishes. And I'm not usually one to complain.Mind you the Long Island was 10 freakin dollars. The only reason I left one star was because the server was polite.

First of all, let me say that when I booked a reservation for a large party in the middle of prime dining time, they were very accommodating....Thanks for that. We were there with a large party to celebrate.  The service was very slow.  After taking drink orders, it took 15-20 minutes to get them (soft drinks, BJ's beers, and some wine).  The server brought out the wrong wine and then said they don't offer the white wine that was requested, even though there were 6 on the menu.  I ordered a sample of one of their house beers.  When it was delivered, it was in a dirty glass and then it took 20 minutes more to get it replaced. The appetizers were pretty good overall, but they are small portions, so be prepared to double up. When they brought dinner, they brought out half at a time, with almost 10 minutes between the two services, the second half said that their food was lukewarm.  The portions are large-like most places.  You can easily share most dinner items.  Everyone did say that the food was pretty good, though the hand-tossed pizza was pricey. For the money spent, average at very best; but the dinner service needs improvement. The atmosphere is great, the beers and homemade sodas are fantastic, and the menu is good.  Just some minor improvements in service and attention can turn this into a great place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=200,3.4,3.17,3.17,2.536,3.262

After my table ordered our food, We probably waited for another 30 mins before we got it because they made a mistake with one of our dishes and had to remake it from scratch.

The turnaround time was fast and TV's were stratigically placed throughout the restaurant - good vantage points from most seats in the restaurant.

179,Jessica G.,"Margate, FL",481,618,1408.0,3.0,2014-06-25,"There is a BJ's in Coral Springs that is much closer to my house, but I was in the area running some errands on a Saturday so we decided to stop in here and grab a snack and a drink and catch the second half of whatever World Cup game was going on at the moment (there have been so many, I don't remember what countries I was watching anymore).  We arrived a little after 6 and were seated immediately. Our waiter was quick to offer us drinks, there are lots of fun looking specialty drinks but I didn't try any of those. They also have quite a few beer options with beers unique to this establishment (restaurant & brewshouse). The waiter asked if we needed more time to look at the menu. I of course needed more time especially when I noticed how many choices there are. Pizza, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, salads, pasta, shareable apps. I don't think the menu is quite as extensive as Cheesecake Factory but I think it was pretty close.  Since we were there more for the game and I am not generally a big fan of this American family type restaurant I didn't get into the entree portion of the menu but instead ordered an individual buffalo chicken pizza. I have to say I was impressed with the pizza. It had enough spice/tang to be buffalo but wasn't too spicy for me. It also had a little bit of ranch. but that flavor was thankfully not overpowering as I'm not a huge ranch dressing fan. It had a good amount of chicken (though it did taste a little processed) and I really loved that the pizza had celery on it (chopped into fine pieces of course). The crust of the pizza was cooked well and was probably more of a coal fire/brick oven style considering it's crispiness, though it wasn't blackened at all, which I also appreciated. The service here was decent and the waiter did his best to keep an eye on drink refills. I will say that it was a very fast dining experience, and for this type of family restaurant that is probably what they aim for, but in general I prefer a little less rushed feeling, though I will say when the server delivered the bill he made sure to tell us to take our time. On another note as we were leaving around 7 a large crowd had formed at the front and there was obviously a wait, so we must have been lucky at the time we walked in as prime dinner hours do seem to get quite busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=160,3.52,3.22,3.22,2.7,3.3400000000000007

I normally go for the amazing food Happy Hour, half off all appetizers and mini pizzas. Drink deals aren't anything special for Happy Hour, like a dollar off cocktails and $3 house wine. I normally order a few appetizers to munch on and a mini pizza or two (yes, I look like a lil' piggy when everything comes out - no shame!). I highly recommend the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls. I've ordered and eaten both as meals. Ask for extra Poke sauce on the side with the Ahi...the flavor is amazing!  The reason for my four stars is the service. It is very slow at this time. For Happy Hour you have to sit specifically in the bar area. I've stood beside a booth for 10 minutes waiting for it to be cleaned so I can sit down. Once sitting it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come, introduce herself and ask for drinks. When food is brought out the waiters seem to disappear and if you need the anything more or the check you are again on the ""search"" for the waiter. As a frequent visitor I do have a favorite waiter who is the exception to what I wrote above. Her name is Jessica and she is wonderful!

I have tried this one five times now and each time the service was Horrible, unfriendly, slow and rude. Food was mostly consistent with others and very good. I quit going because it was not good bad the steakhouse next door was superior in every way.  I returned against my better judgement because my daughter flew into town and loves the food there. Big mistake. Not only is the service worse and tactless but now the food has gone down hill. The crusted parm chicken white sauce was gross. Oily, separated and sour.

The manager there named Dennis was also adorable. He's eventually going to Fort Myers after his training time here in Pembroke Pines. We might have to take a trip there in the future.

We went with one of her favorites the pepperoni pizza dip - it was so yummy!  And another order of wings. My hubby is a wings fan.  For our dinner plates, we got shrimp scampi and the salmon with veggies. The salmon was overcooked, to the point that it was hard towards the corners, the veggies were spectacular crispy/crunchy.

Thick breading and hardly any sauce and cheese. Every bite tasted mostly like dough. The ingredients were falling off the top for lack of sauce and cheese to hold them together. My wife ordered the Caesar Salad which was nice and full of dressing. She also had the broccoli and cheese soup on a bread bowl. This soup was delicious, mainly because of the sourdough bread bowl. The bowl has the top cut out which is toasted with butter and garlic, like a Texas toast.  Now, the waitress did not introduced herself and neither smiled at us all the time we were there. She kept our drinks refilled, but was in robot mode. I'm not sure if this place is always like this, or maybe because it was a Saturday night, but the food and the service was really not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=80,3.48,3.3,3.3,2.8240000000000003,3.3720000000000003

It is located in the same strip mall as the new Trader Joe's.  I have been such a fan of the South Miami location.  This one is smaller but has the same décor and great large bar /lounge area.  We started with a couple of beers. I enjoy the blonde, it's refreshing! Our server was super sweet but she seemed way off.  Her mind was not where it was supposed to be that's for sure.   She would say the strangest things.  Odd!  Anyhow, we were starving so I ordered Spinach & Artichoke dip and my daughter ordered the avocado rolls.  We have had these before and we especially love the avocado rolls.  Both arrived and we knew something was way wrong with the rolls.  They looked nothing like we were used to.  I took one very tiny bite.  Oh no no they were awful, not even edible. They were super fried and greasy and the avocado was HOT!  Yuk, so when our server came to check on us I asked her to remove the plate because they were so bad.  She took the plate away not really saying anything.  I am not one to get items taken off the bill but if it is obvious one tiny bite was taken the polite think to do would be to take it off the bill.  Nope, I paid for it.  We started to eat the Spinach and artichoke dip.  Again, disappointing.  Way to creamy, tasted watered down.  The only thing that saved it was the artichoke.  I would say skip both of these appetizers here.  It is a shame because the location in South Miami, both of these were excellent.  They have a very large menu and I so wished I could try other menu items but I am obsessed with their deep dish pizza.   So we ordered one, of course!  I am a Chicago girl so of course I LOVE deep dish pizza.  Is it as deep or filled with ingredients top to bottom?  No  but hey we are not in Chicago nor do they say it is Chicago style.  It is thick, fresh ingredients, very tasty crust, and such good cheese and diced tomatoes.   If you are a fan of sauce this may not be the type of pizza for you.   They barely put any sauce on it, more flavor from the fresh diced tomatoes.  This must be why I enjoy it so much.  Cheese, cheese, sausage & mushrooms, tomatoes, oh yes happiness!  This pizza is five stars to me. I wish they delivered this awesome pizza.  Thankfully, the pizza was just as good as I remembered.  I hope on our next visit the service and quality of appetizers get much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=60,3.4,3.31,3.31,2.9880000000000004,3.346

207,Aly P.,"Boca Raton, FL",8,20,1.0,1.0,2015-06-13,"I felt something on me and found a huge roach! threw him off of me. He ran around for a bit before he went to the next table where they screamed about until one brave woman finally killed him. We told the waiter who got the manager. (The waiter was pretty bad too. Horrible service and he just walked away from us, he didn't care about his tables at all..) The manager basically believed I had brought it in the restaurant without noticing!!! He said and I quote ""well you just sat down so how do I know you didn't bring it in with you?"" I was sitting inside his restaurant for 15 mins before being seated. I'm sure as hell would have noticed that big sucker on me earlier. He was rude, and didn't even compensate for the experience. Just gave me this face like ""ehh we don't have roaches. It's you"". He basically called me dirty. (For the record I showered before I went out)  When my boyfriend tried to explain that there was proof of the dead roach, he ignored him and never had anyone clean up it up! The busters moved the tables around and cleaned the tabletop but never cleaned the floor. People were eating next to it. This was my first time here. NEVER AGAIN. and native Floridians know if you find one that big, there are more!! I refused to order food because if there is one in the dining room, who the hell knows what's in the kitchen. Nasty.

262,Denver E.,"Hollywood, FL",225,322,378.0,3.0,2015-06-21,"I have been going to BJ's for a couple of years now and the first thing that comes to mind is consistency. It has always been the roughly the same general experience each time I go. In some places, that is a drag, but for this restaurant, it works well. BJ's is a big place with many tables, lots of big screens, and even some outdoor seating. As far as the menu, it's big. I mean binder book big, and oddly enough, that works here. I have had the fish tacos and they were ok.. but I think their pizzas are way better. My favorite part of BJ's actually isn't the food, but instead their beer selection, made in their own brewery.  If I were to suggest beers, hands down the best three are the Brewhouse Blonde (a very nice pale Kolsch style beer), Jeremiah Red (my personal go-to, a nice malty red number) and Tatonka Stout (an exceptional stout that seriously just gets better everytime I drink it). Service has always been great here, and the one time I ever sent something back, they were bending over backwards to make good. The only reason that I give it 3 stars instead of four is because the food is a bit mediocre, especially when compared to the quality of the beer and I feel like it can be a bit pricey. I will tell you though, if you are looking for a good spot to grab a pizza and a beer or three, BJ's is a good spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=260,3.28,3.31,3.26,2.7640000000000002,3.298

The restaurant is big and it was empty except for one occupied table. Having a laptop and some documents to review, we asked for a booth or one of the many vacant 4-top tables. The hostess told us no. I asked why. She said two people were only permitted to sit at the smallest table with 2 chairs. ""But the restaurant is empty,"" I said.

I completely forgot abut this place, especially being that I shop in the area lol! Upon entering the eatery you notice it is a big space. TVs around certain parts of the restaurant. We thought about eating at the bar but it looked packed. So instead we decided on waiting for a table.  After few minutes we were seated in a table for two people. Within a few minutes our server came immediately to the table. Man I was I surprised despite being it was Father's Day and it was pretty busy.  For starters we ordered the Crispy Calamari. It was lightly breaded, fried crisp and served with marinara and lemon garlic aioli. The calamari was just ok, little oily. The calamari to me was a little thin. For our main dishes, I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya which has blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce. Served over a rice pilaf and topped with green onions. Again it was not bad. Just the right amount. They sprinkle plenty of cayenne pepper around the plate so be careful. I accidentally stirred in some and it was hot! But flavor wise just ok.  My boo ordered the California Burger which is a half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. It looked almost like a patty melt but according to my boo it was just ok. Overall our experience was pretty good and again service was awesome. Seriously you get a little apprehensive of coming to a eatery when it is busy, people waiting outside and wondering how customer service will be.

The breadbowl itself is garlic and toasted to perfection. Now onto the alcohol. My boyfriend and I are beer snobs and I must say I am a fan of their beer selection.

224,Chris B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",16,15,,3.0,2015-07-19,"This would have been a 5 star review if the kitchen was up to par. Either there Kitchen Manager needs to tighten up or be replaced because his staff is embarrassing him/her!!!!Our server provided hands down one of the best experiences I've had in a restaurant in a while. He gave great recommendations and was very attendant. The FOH (Front of House) staff was very friendly we were greeted immediately. Me and my girlfriend ordered two of there in house brewed beers and they were phenomenal. We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as a appetizer and the portion was a complete let down for the price but it was very tasty. For entrees we both ordered burgers my girlfriend ordered hers well done and mine was medium. That is defiantly not how they came out!!! Mine was well done and my girlfriends was medium rare to medium. Once our server was available he came right over and took my girlfriends burger back as I was able to tolerate mine. They returned my girlfriends burger looking like a complete disaster. She had cut her burger in half before she sent it back and they returned it the same way. That means they opened up the burger pulled it apart and recooked the meat. It's was a sloppy mushy mess when we got it back and the best part was that it was still pink in the inside! I finally got the managers attention and made him aware of the situation and he definitely seemed bothered by the kitchens amateur mistakes. Another thing that really bothered us about the kitchen was the fact at how dirty it seemed. Our table was positioned so we could see into the kitchen when the servers opened the door. All we saw was trash, food, and what looked like greasy rags on the floor by the dish pit. I understand this is the dishwasher area but if this is what guests can see when the doors are opened the least you can do is keep it somewhat clean. In my opinion corporate/owners need to have a sit down with the GM of the location and consider replacing there Kitchen Manager. We even witnessed what looked like a duplicate order of desert come out of the kitchen. What a joke!  The only reason I am giving this review 3 stars instead of 1 is because our server Darnel was phenomenal and because the manager on shift made things right. They are the reason I will give the restaurant another shot.

And then after a ridiculous wait and absent waiter , the runner or dishwasher brought out the food. My "" medium"" burger showed up extra well done. It had obviously been stuck to the flat top as it was broken, burnt and delivered on a very stale bun. The manager explained it had cracked when "" scraped"" off the grill. Even the lettuce and tomato looked like refugees from a bad salad bar. They kept offering desert as a consolation instead of redoing the burger. After some effort the manager agreed to remove the price of the burger, no apology for wasting the time. The owners must take pride as their names are on a brass plaque. I wonder if they know they've hired the village idiot as an expediter. Any one who cared would never have let that off the line. I'm guessing the other idiot must be the chef. For a $12.00 burger they should at least look at their offerings. I recently spoke with Scott the manager who had taken time to speak with me regarding this posting.

150,Mike T.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,51,,1.0,2016-02-28,"The good:  The restaurant is large (no waiting for a table), well decorated, and has a nice atmosphere.  The menu is large with lots of options, including pizza, burgers, entree salads and a large ""lite"" menu.  They have a large beer selection that includes both their own brews and a dozen outside choices.  They also serve liquor.  Large TVs are tuned to sports.  There is a shaded patio with tables.   The bad:  The service is lacking.  Typically, the drink order gets taken and filled quickly and then everything goes downhill.  You can't find your server and everything takes forever.  Requested items, such as extra salad dressing, never arrive.  During one visit, there was no silverware on the table when we sat down.  I had to ask three separate times before it was provided.  The third request was made after our food arrived.  We sat and watched our food get cold while we waited for forks and napkins. We've also had entrees arrive just a few minutes after the appetizers. Recently, we came in early for lunch on a Sunday, around 11:30 AM.  There were only a few other tables.  Our drinks sat empty for most of the meal.  To get our check, we had to ask a bus boy to find our server.  The managers stood in a group by the entrance to the kitchen talking and ignoring everything going on around them.  Also, the food is hit or miss, sometimes good, other times lousy.  On a recent visit, I found two hairs in my sandwich.  I pulled one out of it, just as the server arrived at the table.  She took the food away and promised to bring a new order.  The manager then came over and announced that everyone in the kitchen wears hair nets.  He didn't seem to believe us.  My wife was nearly done with her meal before the replacement food arrived.  We were charged full price for the meal.   We've given this place a try 5 or 6 times in the past year.

260,Charles D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,1.0,2016-05-21,"First, let me start by saying it as a Friday night and due to the amount of people waiting we didn't expect exceptional service. We ended up getting a table in the bar so we didn't have to wait long. We were very impressed by the variety on the menu but choices does not constitute good food. We ordered drinks and appetizers first and it started of the artichoke and spinach dip came out cold.  They fixed it and we were enjoying the ambience.  We decided to order our meals and we ordered a ribeye dinner w brussels sprouts and rice and the turkey burger upgraded with the wedge salad.  The wedge was good however it came out before my food.  The food arrived and what they were advertising on the menu as a ribeye they delivered a large sirloin and insisted it was a ribeye. If anyone knows their steaks, a ribeye is a totally different cut of meat than that of a sirloin.  A ribeye is round the fat running through with a tenderloin cap around the other side of the fat, by far the most flavorful steak due to the fat that runs through the meat.  A sirloin has the fat that trims the outside of the steak and is a much cheaper cut of meat.  So we told our server that you must have accidentally ordered me a sirloin, no worries, just make sure that you only charge me for the sirloin.  Oh I'm sorry sir but that is the ribeye our sirloin is smaller in portion. The server walked off without saying anything.  We were sitting there wondering okay should we keep eating or should we wait.  About 10 minutes later, the manger Scott who was very cocky but didn't want to argue probably bc he knows what the restaurant is server their customers. The manager says my sirloins are 5 oz an my ribeye are 14 oz.  To which we replied, thats fine but then this is just a bigger sirloin and portion size doesn't determine the cut of meat....We asked so are you telling me this is a ribeye.  He replied I dont argue with customers. He wouldn't answer and he tried to quickly to rectify the situation by asking what else do you want.  We said thats bc there is nothing to argue about, this is a sirloin.  Just charge me for what you served.  He walked away without saying anything. At this point, we were treated like we were the problem and we were ignored simply by bringing it to their attention that they are advertising and selling sirloins as ribeyes on the menu=false advertisement.  We are foodies and we frequent nice restaurants and we know the DIFFERENCE.  It was an insult. We asked for nothing for free and we could have complained about how long the food took, the brussel sprouts were under par, the turkey burger was ok came out separate than the side salad it was supposed to be served with and without the dijon.  We waited 15 minutes for the dijon to come, by that time we were disgusted by how we were treated by management we asked for our bill.  The server came to the table and said so I suppose you don't want a to go box.  We said no thank you, HE REPLIED FAIR ENOUGH.   WE got our check was charge for the sirloin and full price for everything and left 15% gratuity.  We were not apologized to and WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!  Listen, people we didn't want anything for free but at least acknowledge!  Any restaurant manager should know their cuts of meat.  Its basics. Hopefully this post forces them to serve what is advertised.  I challenge anyone to order their ribeye and you be the judge.  ITS SIRLOIN!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=260,3.24,3.3,3.272,2.404,3.2760000000000007

It appears if you know someone there you get seated faster than others. A couple came in 10 mins after we got there and were seated right away. And no they were not there waiting prior to us. Anyway, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food portions are small. I ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza. I ordered a mini size since it was only for me and it had 4 slices. When I got it, I thought I had ordered a kid's meal. $10 for 4 pizza bites. I tried their ginger IPA and enjoyed it. This was the only thing I liked the entire night. Our waitress did something I hate... it appears we can only stay in the restaurant if we are eating. Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert and we politely said no. Two minutes later she returned with our bill. We never asked for the bill. Our drinks were still full so why did she do this, I dont know. Matter of fact, I ordered another beer after.

But Friday night got the sudden urge to revisit and was that a huge mistake. I still have the sour taste the experience left in my mouth. I wouldn't be revisiting BJs brewhouse or recommending them to my worst enemy. We arrived and was told it was a twenty minute wait and we waited not to bad for a Friday night. We got seated and everything went downhill. At first our waitress Nicole was upbeat and friendly and to be honest you can be serving the worst food and the waitress can turn that experience into the best. After waiting to be recognized we already knew what we were ordering and put our order right in. We started with the appetizer avocado egg rolls (use to the best) now they put some sauce I guess to substitute the avocado and it's real spicy. We then went to our entree the hubby ordered the crusted parm chicken w/ mash potatoes and broccoli , the chicken was good but the mash was horrible and the broccoli cold and stale. My oldest son ordered the classic burger it's a burger and he's a kid so guess what BJs excellent ten for that one. I ordered the north beach mahi and shrimp and was not impressed one bit. It was missing flavor all around. Youngest got chicken tenders and fries and he didn't even touch the tenders but it's tree pieces with a decent amount of fries. Then came the worst of the worst we order our pzookie and two ice cream sundae for the boys. After waiting over twenty five minutes for our dessert and asking twice about it it finally came out but I had to give my pzookie ice cream to my youngest child because they only brought out one sundae and had to share a spoon with my youngest son and husband to eat the pzookie because they only brought one spoon. After she rushed away from our table when dropping the desert and came back to pick up the check we told her to kindly remove the ice scream scoop we never received she never apologized she blamed another waitress. Then saw the waitress coming with the ice cream and told her forget it it's too late. Instead of giving the ice cream since it was already served and out of courtesy not charged the 1.50 it cost. Well we left the 15% tip because we have manners but clearly BJ does not.  It's really sad I've been here a few times for dinner and lunch precious to this visit and never had this experience but then again that was awhile back something clearly has changed with management or chefs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=60,2.84,3.18,3.24,2.6320000000000006,3.0440000000000005

Both were cooked how we ordered and the fries that came with it were so tasty. I love thin fries and these are amazing. The plating was interesting as well. The food was not served on regular plates, but the best way to describe it is a metal baking pan with brown wax paper as the liner. It was unexpected, given the interior of the restaurant. It gave it the feel of a small home town mom and pop diner.

131,Eric R.,"Hialeah, FL",76,14,2.0,4.0,2016-07-26,"Ok,  I've been coming to BJ's brew house for some time now there are some good points and some points that used to be better.  The service is actually pretty good.  The staff is attentive but often just seem tired and a little uninspired or bored.  That being said,  they are never rude and always make sure you are properly attended to.  The food is well done American fare with some Asian and italian influences that ranges from ahi poke to burgers to salads,  flat breads, pizza, pasta, steaks, seafood and everything you'd expect in between.  The food is always above average and has an average price range.  Drinks are actually pretty good.  They brew their own house beers that are always on the menu and have seasonal that they bring from time to time.  Aside from their house beers on tap,  they have a large selection of other beers on tap and even more in bottles.  They also have a good selection of wines and a full liquor bar to satisfy your every beverage need.  Another good thing they have is that they have embraced technology with free WiFi as well as having their own phone app that allows you to make reservations,  order food ahead of time and even pay your bill using the app.  If you do use the app,  do your wait staff a big favor and let them know that you paid with the app.  Imagine how horrible it is to get to a table to find everyone gone and not know if they paid or not.  Yes they have a way to check but it still is nice to prevent that moment of panic. If a customer walks without paying,  they have to pay for it out of their pocket. They also have a decent rewards program that gets you free appetizers or a discount based on the points accumulated.  I really enjoy their application. You can even see your running tab in the app if you know what your table number is which you can ask you wait staff to give you. You will also need this to pay with the mobile app.  Now to the not as good as it used to be part.  Their happy hour menu prices and deals have changed. Happy hour is from 3pm until 7pm but only in the bar area although they have made exceptions if the bar is full to capacity. The house beer gets $1 off sharable appetizers get $2 off when in the past these are appetizers were half off. There are also deals on their flat bread pizza. A great deal on Tuesdays is glasses and bottles of wine are half off all day which is the best deal you will find anywhere.  All in all,  it's a great place to enjoy happy hour,  a good meal both healthy as well as not so healthy and always good if not uninspired service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=80,2.96,3.21,3.264,2.8640000000000003,3.11

To add insult to injury, every order was wrong (wrong salad dressing, wrong side, etc), and there were zero refills on the drinks.  Asking for a to-go box takes an additional 15 minutes.

269,Malia H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,3.0,2016-08-06,I was excited to try this place because I have been looking for deep dish pizza in South Florida for a long time and someone recommended this place to me and said they had it.

I ordered sausage and pepperoni and I was not that impressed. The crust was good but it was really not deep dish pizza it was more like a Pizza Hut type taste to it the sauce was very sweet and the cheese tasted very good but I just could not get past the sauce. The crust was good I wish it had been more deep dish like I thought but hey it wasn't horrible I just don't think that I would go to this place again and order the pizza. For dessert I did get some sort of cookie with vanilla ice cream on top and that was amazing I do have to get for thumbs up well actually stars for that that was really really good.

It was reasonably priced but it was nothing special. My sister had a bison burger and didn't care for it. For dessert, we had beignets. My mom told us how delicious they were, and boy was she right. I was craving more! Deliciously pillowy, not to sweet, and with a side of fresh strawberries, ice cream, and whipped cream. This is not a dessert to pass up! As far as our server goes, she was ok. Her name was Kathy, and she was very busy! It was very clear to me that she was trying to upsell every chance she could. I understand needing to upsell, but I don't like it when it's obvious. Then it's just annoying. She suggested appetizers. Then she suggested more rounds of drinks. Then she suggested dessert. I don't know, maybe it was just me who noticed it, but I heard her doing it at all the other tables as well. Last thing- their website says ALL pizzas are half off on Mondays. That is not the case, and BJ's needs to make it more clear. My mom got a mini deep dish, which was not half off.  Overall, forgettable as usual.

31,Ricky R.,"Cooper City, FL",40,70,611.0,2.0,2017-04-23,"I went hear for a Sunday late lunch around 3:30pm with my two sons, it was rainy and restaurant was at about 50% capacity.   We were sat by the hostess promptly and then we waited a very long time to be addressed by our waitress, I actually walked back to the hostess and asked for our waitress.  When I got back she arrived and she really didn't seem to care, which irks me seeing I was once in the service industry.  She said something like ""yeah I know I'm late"" in a laughing voice but I didn't care for it. We ordered tater skins for an app an they were actually good and not super oily.  It's was served with ranch and sour cream dips. My kids had a cheese burger and chicken fingers, 2 out of 5. My son had a hair in his chicken fingers but I didn't say anything as he was almost done with his meal anyway. I had the black and blue burger and it was ok, the bun had like a butter spray on it which made my hands greasy which is annoying.  I was told it would come with lettuce and onion and it did not. The burger was kinda thin for the money as well, I ordered it medium and it came out med well.   I ate my sons lettuce from his kids burger.   The waitress had to be flagged down to get our bill and again we were waiting to be acknowledged by our waitress when we were done eating, it's was just annoying.  On the way out we hit the restrooms to wash up and the men's room was super messy with water splashes on counter tops hand towels on the floor and counters.  Additionally having two boys I always tell them to watch out around urinals and don't step in any ""puddles"" and there was a major ""puddle mess"" in front of the urinals.  I told my kids to use the toilets instead as to not step in it.  I told the hostess on the way out to so I can be addressed.  It was a sign that the restrooms haven't been spot checked in a long time due to how bad it was, you can tell the difference. Overall it's a 3 star place but lack of service and filthy restrooms brings it down to 2 stars.    It's a nice place that needs some attention or eventually they will loose customers little by little and struggle.

However after another 45mins our waitress brought the food to the table as an appetizer we had the barbeque boneless chicken and for my entree the lemon herbed chicken with Brussels sprouts and tomato perfectly seasoned over a bed of brown rice. OMG it was amazing. The chicken was succulent and juicy and the veggies were more flavorful than I could've ever imagined. The strawberry lemonade wasn't any good but my long island definitely did the trick.

32,Maryann S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",275,126,418.0,4.0,2017-05-02,"We came here for a late lunch after a full day of shopping around the area. The plaza get a little packed from nearby stores but regardless the side u park on, there is easy access in both sides to the entrance. Sometimes depending on the hour of day your having a bite to eat, it does get a little packed. So if your in a rush or hate to wait, you can sit by the bar area and there is a lot of seating and high chair/tables. We didn't want to wait for a table to we sat in the bar area. Service is semi-quick, it would be the same if you were to sit in the dining area. For drinks, I ordered the strawberry lemonade, had strawberry chunks and sourness was settled, not over powering  at all.  What's nice about the appetizer is that you can get a shareable dish or mini bites. We stuck with the shareable dish and ordered the chips & artichoke/spinach dip. Chips were a bit greasy but warm and the dip had pieces of spinach with little chunks of artichoke that broke apart as you scope it with your chip. Not bad at all! For my main entree, I was being good and ordered the quinoa/brown rice with shrimp. The mixture of the rice was perfect and tasted more of the quinoa, it balanced with the tomato and mushroom with steamed shrimp, that was lightly seasoned. Shrimp could of use a bit of lemon but that's ok. Dish was fulfilling with only have the calories, plus for me! Dessert! Omg! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pazookie with 2 scoops of ice cream on top ! Fresh from the oven, it was just WOW Amazing! That dish never disappointments me at all!

17,Christian D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,165,214.0,2.0,2017-05-10,"My GF and I were at the mall nearby and were starving by the time we left. We decided to stop by BJs for dinner. It was about 5:15 on a Saturday.  Surprisingly enough, they were quite empty. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server was pleasant, I am sorry her name escapes me right now. She brought us our beverages and we ordered our food: I got a BBQ burger on a gluten free bun (stupid dietary restriction!) and my GF got the pork chop. We each ordered a side salad. My GF and I chatted for a few minutes and the salads were brought out. The lettuce was crisp, cold and the veggies were fresh and temp appropriate. The main meal came out maybe 10 min after we finished the salads. My burger was very tasty looking, as was my GF's meal, and both were temperature appropriate. We each took a big bite of our meals..... and were immediately disappointed in the lack of flavor. For something that is supposed to have big, bold taste, my BBQ burger was wimpy and meek. The bun was tolerable but it quickly got soggy and fell apart, as most gluten free buns are prone to do. The fries were crisp and warm, but over salted. I drained my iced tea to rehydrate my over salted tastebuds, but little did I know that would be the only one I got, as the server never came back by after the initial stop by when the meal was delivered. My GF 's pork chop was heavy on the salt as well. It was juicy but really just lacked any over all flavor besides sodium chloride. The baked potato she ordered as a side looked like someone set it on fire, as it was VERY black on the top. She cut away that part and ate 1/2 of the rest. It was overall a very disappointing meal for what we paid. With so many restaurants in the area, BJs need to tighten up.

The restaurant was not super crowded but the service was lacking. Our food arrived in decent time, but 4 of the 6 orders were not correct In some way. IThey served pizza but didn't have crushed pepper or oregano. The light above the table was caked with dust and cobwebs. The floors were noticeably not clean. This is not my first trip here and the atmosphere is pretty nice but it was disappointing on this visit. Hopefully this was just an off night. This restaurant is still worth a try.

49,Jessica D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-05,"This was once our favorite place to eat dinner until tonight. We walked in as a party of 8 on a Thursday night around 7:30 PM for a birthday. The food was great. However, the service was absolutely terrible. It took 35 minutes for our drinks to reach the tables and 40 minutes for our appetizers to come out. Our waters took about an hour to come to the table. Our entrees took an hour plus to come out. The manager John came by to apologize they were short staffed but did absolutely nothing to make sure our drinks were filled as he said he would. A very rude waitress came by to let us know the bar was out of Black Label and did not offer us something different. This place is not the same as it use to be years ago. It's sad because BJ's once was our favorite place but after tonight, we will not be returning. I hate writing bad reviews and being this customer; however something needs to change with this restaurant. Lazy servers and lazy cooks with no ambition. Not worth waiting for the food and spending so much money. You're better off going across the street to Ale House where there is better food, service, and more affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines?start=40,2.56,2.86,3.12,,2.74

28,Jesus V.,"Miami-Dade, FL",23,17,72.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"I hate to write negative reviews - I'm a firm believer that the negativity doesn't really ""change"" anything in most cases. I find it better to speak with management but sadly, in this case, the manager was too disinterested to speak to us, despite having had our order placed incorrectly, never having received 1/2 of what we requested, and ultimately leading to one person in my party not eating at all - this is unacceptable. Add to that, the server's lack of empathy for the situation with her response of ""oh, that's too bad for you"" when we spoke with her again to address the still missing entree. I did receive my food (mostly) and while it was good, the combination of missing food + how the whole thing was handled by the server and manager spoke volumes about the restaurant - one that we will no longer be patronizing, I might add. Oh, and while I appreciate that they are really full on a busy Friday night, the fact that the manager literally stood 2 feet from our table and couldn't be bothered to turn and face us, let alone address the glaring lack of service. Not even to apologize or anything. But that's cool, because you've got a truck load more people waiting outside for tables than to address the actual paying customers sitting in your establishment...for now at least. Until the day comes that you don't anyways and they close this place and open up a Starbucks or froyo shop in its place. Yay, commercialism!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pembroke-pines,2.6,2.86,3.128,,2.7560000000000002
58,Jimmy S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,5.0,2017-10-14,"Outstanding service, went here for a birthday lunch with my Mom, the food was good i'd give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars but the service was great in the end. My mom loves Longhouse wanted nothing to do with BJ's but I convinced her to come here since it was my birthday she was a bit critical because of it, the salads showed up and as the guy was placing them on our table the waitress also showed up with our steaks with that ""oh shit"" look on her face. Not such a big deal really but whatever we pushed the steaks aside for a few minutes finished the salads then while we were finishing the steaks the manager came around and asked how everything was, my moim said everything was great but I told him about the salad and entrée showing up at the same time said I didn't want to complain but since he was asking it would defeat the purpose if I did not tell him. He said he was going to give us free dessert to make up for it, once again I told him I didn't want to complain everything was good it just if he's asking for criticism then I want to give it to help him better things. So the waitress comes back says we have free dessert on the house and i'm not much of a dessert person so I jokingly ask her if I can get another beer instead of dessert a few minutes later she shows up with free dessert for my mom and a free Oktoberfest for myself.. I don't really know what to say other than this place goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy and it was really refreshing in this day and age. Five star review from me.

So many daily/weekly specials, deals, and guest favorites that are bombarding this place - who would be disappointed? Not this guy.  Their menu is so vast. They have selections ranging from soups, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, tacos, handcrafted burgers, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, and so on. There's always something new to try.  Their Happy Hour menu brings light to this place (Monday - Friday from 3pm to 7pm; Sunday - Thursday: 10pm to either 12am or 1am). Some notable deals happen during pro football games, such as $3 Domestic Bottles and Chips & Dips (available in the bar only), $4 BJ's handcrafted beers, and $5 Dark Horse Wines and Call Drinks.  PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES! Have you ever tried their world-famous pizookie? It's pretty much a pizza cookie that's out of this world. Are you in the mood for something very chocolatey? Then you should try the Triple Chocolate Pizookie (made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate). Or maybe you want to try something with marshmallowy goodness merged with peanut butter. Well, they have a Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie (topped with vanilla bean ice cream and marshmallows baked to a golden finish). It's like having s'mores in doors.
