287,Pk G.,"Goodyear, AZ",9,79,,4.0,2012-01-02,"So, I ran out of gift ideas for Christmas.  I found myself at Fry's at the gift card section.  I decided to buy my wife a couple of gift cards (cheaper than jewelry).  I picked up a Carrabas and one to BJ's since we had never been there.  Our friends did tell us that they liked it so I thought, why not.   We stopped in for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar.  We were greeted as soon as we sat down by the bartender who took his time to go over the menu and the beer selections.  We did sample a few different beers and they were good. The menu is very complete and looked good.  We decided to try a sampler plate and a couple of side salads.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.   I am sure we will return again.   It was a great experience and total cost for ""lunch"" and ""some"" adult beverages was under $40.00",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=240,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.12,3.3600000000000003

My daughter had a cheeseburger and fries. She ordered her burger well done and I medium. Both burgers were perfectly cooked, juicy and as good as a hamburger could be. What made it most wonderful for us was the waitress was expedient, never letting us sit there with an empty glass ( within 30 seconds of our glass being empty she was there to see if we wanted more). The beers are phenomenal the decor is easy on the eyes. Bathrooms are clean and well kept.

Here is what really made the night...my husband and I split something and it came with fries and he likes thick and I like the shoestring.  So, Lacey took it upon herself to do half and half on our order.  I know, it's not rocket science but the fact that she took an extra step and thought outside the box was awesome!

175,Becky S.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,17,,4.0,2012-06-24,"This place has everything, and you will not be disappointed....that is, after you finally get to sit down!  Unfortunately for those of us who don't want to wait to be seated, this place has been discovered by many, and there is often a good crowd waiting outside on the weekends. The good news is, it is worth the wait. I have been to this place several times, as it is close to my home. If you are the indecisive type, the good news is you can close your eyes and point to something on the menu and it WILL be good. Fresh salad greens and tomato/mozzarella salads are a welcome retreat from the romaine fare at other places. The fish and chips here is reminiscent of the traditional Wisconsin fish fry I sometimes miss. The burgers are great, the sandwiches never disappoint. A full bar with a great beer selection will leave you wondering at the end of the night how your bill ended up so high (oops).  Our last visit, we just sat at the bar and munched stuffed mushrooms with a pesto sauce - a steal at $4.50 off the ""small bites"" menu - and thai style wontons dipped in sesame. Supposedly the deep dish pizza is good, but I have yet to try it, since it looks like a meal that would feed four people minimally. One observation I've made is that this place, being next to Fleming's (a more pricey restaurant), leaves people confused in terms of attire. You'll see people their Friday-night-out attire, but there will also be a family coming straight from a baseball game, the kids still dusty in their little league uniforms. To me, BJ's has a dim, refined, date-night atmosphere that invites couples but is a great meet-up for business associates. Now, I'm a mom, but if you're going to bring the kids, please have them in decent clothes and on their best behavior. This isn't where you would choose to go for a ""food adventure,"" but it is the place you would take friends with diverse tastes in food and booze, or maybe the in-laws from out of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=200,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.9600000000000004,3.6000000000000005

Our party of 4 arrived and we ordered 4 drinks and one appetizer.  It was about 20 minutes for 3 of us to get our first order of soft drinks... 30 minutes had gone by the time we got our appetizer.  We tried to get our waiter flagged down but he was either no where or at other tables quite a way from our section.   We caught a passing waitress and complained, She was great, she took stock of what we were missing, and promptly brought us our refills and the beer that was ordered.  1 hour had past and now we had long eaten our appetizer and drank our drinks.  Our food arrived and was good.   Our waiter came over and apologized for the mix up, their computers had crashed.  2 of us ordered 3rd refills.   They didn't turn up, just the bill with the manager who apologized for the late food, late drinks, slow service.. but offered nothing in compensation.    The bills were wrongly split but we just exchanged cash between us and left vowing never to return.

277,Margaret N.,"Avondale, AZ",0,63,6.0,3.0,2012-07-05,The food is pretty consistent and good.  We are usually looking for a change of pace from I Hop or Village Inn type fare  when we go to BJs.   Usually have to wait to be seated so we try to avoid the usual peak hours.  Service can be inconsistent.  Sometimes have to flag down other staff to get served.  Luckily they've been responsive.  We've learned to be aggressive about getting drink refills.  The burgers are good. The Tomato soup is great and the Angel Hair pasta is good too.  Avoid the flatbread sandwiches- uninspired.  Ambiance is okay but acoustics aren't great- loud.   Parking is lacking especially on weekends.  We will be back in spite of spotty service.   Good alternative to the AppleBees routine when you are looking for a restaurant that serves alcohol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=280,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7960000000000003,3.5600000000000005

303,Lee B.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,1,,2.0,2012-07-30,"We've dined at BJ's many times and had both decent and not-so-decent experiences. I doubt we'll be back after this last time. There were four of us and we had appetizers, cocktails, dinners, and dessert. One of the entrees came with soup or salad and tortilla soup was ordered. When it arrived it was barely luke warm. By the time our server, Lacee, came around we told her that the soup was cold and asked if it could be reheated. She took it away without a word but before she returned all of our entrees arrived. When she got back with the soup she started to pour the broth over the dry ingredients without even asking if we still wanted it since we were already eating our dinners. When we said that we no longer wanted it because our dinners were already there, she rolled her eyes, made a face, and left the table while we were still talking to her. The rest of the meal was uneventful, the food was adequate although certainly not exceptional. The server tried to be more friendly towards the end of the meal but never once apologized for the cold soup. On our way out we stopped to tell the manager (according to the receipt the manager was April) what had happened and she could not have been more unconcerned. She smiled and listened but made no apologies nor did she even mention anything about talking to the server about the rolling of the eyes and the face she made. She obviously didn't care that her customers were less than satisfied. This is not the first time that we've had what I would consider poor service for the caliber of restaurant. Between mediocre food and mediocre service we won't be returning which is sad because it's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=300,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.6640000000000006,3.6000000000000005

I went last night with the BF and his parents as it was his mom's birthday and that's where they wanted to go. It was actually a pleasant surprise! We all got drinks, I had the skinny -rita, which was really good, tart and fresh tasting. The BF got a snakebite, which was, as always, delicious. For dinner, I had the soup and salad with a caesar salad and tortilla soup. Going the 'healthy' route (I know this was not healthy in any way). The soup was very good and flavorful. They serve it 'fancy' style, putting chicken, avocado, tortilla, cheese, and bell pepper in the bottom of a bowl and then pouring the broth over the bowl table side. Nice touch. The salad was fair. Everyone else reported that they enjoyed their entrees. We had pizzookie for dessert, a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, delish. All of this for only 80$...pretty good deal. My only complaints are minimal and include: I wish they offered half portions at discounted prices....the portion sizes are way too big and there were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but I wouldn't order them because I didn't want such a large portion.

We really do like this place in general, though the parking can be horrific. We started with the chicken won tons; Thai style and they were wonderful. When our pizza showed up and we began to eat, my wife loos at me and says ""is there any sauce on your pizza""?"" Nope"", I said and we waited for the waiter to return. He said something to the effect of, well do you want me to have them put more sauce on it or are you going to eat it like it is. I said, well we'd really like another pizza, this time with sauce. The manager comes over a few minutes later and says something about ""miscommunication"", apologizes and asks us if we ordered it without tomatoes. No, just standard sausage pizza we said. Well, she explains, ""our pizzas are lightly sauced"" (apparently before they have fully risen) ""and sometimes it soaks in or the top rubs"" (against what I didn't ever understand) and may have accidently removed some of the sauce"". So we had to sort of pick apart the pizza in front of her, while she gave us that condescending ""not really a smile-smile"" as if we were mentally challenged, to show her that what we got was essentially cheesy garlic bread with sausage. She wouldn't even glance and it...just kept that artificial smile on her face and said ""let me know if there is anything else that I can do"". As opposed to the nothing that you have already done you mean? That was my inner thought, not to worry, I didn't actually say that. SO, by and by our replacement pie comes out and the waiter says"" don't worry, I told the kitchen ""extra sauce"" and watched them make it. Wonderful, now we got a pie that more resembled spaghetti. Just soaked with sauce. At this point we just give up and ask for our check. The waiter then tells us that due to the pizza issue, we would like to buy you desert. No thanks, we said. He brings us our check and announces, I had that pie taken off your tab (we had a couple of beers and an app as well, so  I wasn't paying that much attention to the total), until my wife pointed out that there were two pizza's on the check and that they took one of them off. I don't bother saying anything at this point, as free food was not what we came for, but I will say this. There would have been one heck of a ruckus if they had charged me for two pizzas.

I went with the crew originally to another brewery at Westgate but the ASU game made parking non-existent so off to Park West we go!  BJ's was the natural choice for an evening of drinks, food, and good company.  The wait time at BJ's at 7:30pm on a Saturday was said to be 25-30 minutes but we were seated after 10 minutes.  No complaints here!  At such a big establishment, the atmosphere was of course gorgeous.  Let's talk food!  We had ordered: Crispy Calamari:  Typical fried squid you can get anywhere.  I personally love the garlic aioli. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms:  Delicious, giant, and juicy!  Just like I like my men!  ;D  Just kidding... kinda.  Seriously though, I can eat that lemon pesto by the spoonful.   Two Steak plates [one had lobster too]:  Both steaks were not cooked to medium-rare and the lobster was a bit too salty.  Both steaks were offered to be redone but hey, we're not picky.  We ate that red meat like champs.  And that lobster tail... demolished.  I really liked the mashed potatoes!  The clam chowder accompaniment and the Caesar salad were also yummy --- especially the chowder! Hawaii Mahi-Mahi:  This was my main dish.  I was completely happy and in love with the juicy mahi-mahi.  The refreshing pineapple fried rice and stir-fry veggies made everything just a touch sweeter.  They had some Sriracha sauce on the side.  Don't be fooled by the fancy description: it's just pure sexy Sriracha. Cajun Pasta:  It was yummy!  The garlic bread was good. The creamy tomato sauce wasn't too spicy --- something I'm always grateful for.  I think food is meant to be tasted.  I don't need to be licking a chili pepper!   Grilled Chicken Pasta:  Creamy pasta is ALWAYS a good thing.  We got the grilled chicken instead of the blackened chicken and it was perfectly match.  I would've been happy with just a bowl of that rotelle noodles with the cream sauce.   Overall it was a lovely evening and our waiter was very charismatic, charming, and accommodating [one of us HAD to watch the Boise St. game.  x_x].  Cheers, BJ's!  Thanks for the great evening!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=80,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.632,3.2800000000000002

One of our biggest obstacles in dining out as a family is that our son is autistic and can only eat chips in restaurants. I asked our server if it was possible to get some tortilla chips by themselves and she was extremely nice about it. Thank you, thank you. A big tip for that kindness alone. My husband enjoyed sampling the beers. He had the small deep dish meat pizza and loved it. In the bit I had, I could tell the meat was very fresh, the cheese was real, and the crust was good--thick but not as heavy as some places. That was definitely the only meal my husband had for the day! I had the seared ahi salad. Oh, that was divine. Colorful with a fantastic mix of textures and tastes. I loved the dabs of wasabi at the corners of my plate. I'm grateful that they had a full menu of ""enlightened"" choices with calories clearly labeled; I wish more places did that.

Service last time I was there was a bit lacking as our server wan't completely focused on our orders.  After taking our drink orders, she bolted off before we could order any appetizers.  Once she came back around, we ordered up some Pepperoni Extreme and Margherita Fresca pizzas for our appetizers and off she went to put in the order.  When the order came out, we got the pepperoni, but a California Club pizza instead of the Margherita.  I guess this is what happens when servers don't write down your order. I get it, servers have bad days, so there's no animosity here or malice there, and the rest of our order came back fine.  Our server could have checked in a few more times for refills but like I said, she was probably having a bad day, or was just about to clock out.   It looked like a new menu since the last time I dined here, but my faves were still there.  BJ's was it's normal good self, but maybe its magic is starting to wear off for me.  It's a solid four stars for the food and the iffy service didn't make it lose any stars; it's just that this place isn't as great for me now as it was when I was in my twenties.  I miss the clam chowder and the chicken lettuce wraps.

169,Errol D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,28,10.0,3.0,2014-08-15,"Hmm. I feel a bit bad giving this a three-star, considering that I haven't tried their pizzas yet. I'll update it later if I come back to try them. I've been to numerous BJs over the years, and I know how their song and dance go: Order the pizza, order the pizzookie, and you're good to go - everything else varies. Well, I decided to go against that formula and ordered a beef dip. Which was actually surprisingly good, considering that I've ordered the same in a different BJs and it was so-so at best. So why in the world would I give this 3-stars and not at LEAST a 4-star? Two things: 1) The service was a bit... lacking. They seated us timely, they were /fairly/ friendly to us, and they got our orders correct. But you could tell that they didn't fully care. They were struggling just to keep their smiles on and their heads on straight. It was later at night, with closing hours coming soon, so it's obvious that most servers would be a little bit conked out by then. But still - it's no excuse. And it can affect other things. Such as the fact that they didn't notice that we didn't have utensils until we'd been staring at our plates for a little while. They didn't fully care for us other than for our orders and our general services. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but I do wish they wouldn't stare at us like we're 'just a job' to them. Again, though, it could just have been the time of the day and the events that transpired before we arrived, but still... it's what makes me remove a star. 2) The pizzookie was... okay. That's kinda' an atrocity for a BJs. Pizzookies are supposed to be soft and gooey (though slightly chewy) and absolutely delicious with the ice cream on top. This one kinda' stuck to the pan a bit more than usual... and was a little too thin in some areas... it was a hassle to eat, and not a mouthgasm as I'd expect. You can't make a pizzookie just 'okay', BJs! Other restaurants are starting to copy the pizzookie idea - you can't be skimping out on the quality! -1 star! Outside of that, everything else was lovely. If you haven't been to a BJs, come here and give it a shot. If you have been to a BJs, I'm sure you know a better one somewhere else. This isn't a bad choice, but it isn't an excellent choice. Again, though, I'm going to have to update this review if I ever come back and try their pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=200,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.564,3.7

I organized a Bachelorette Party and called a ton of places trying to find somewhere we could go without having to rent a party room, require a minimum purchase per attendee, allow separate checks, etc. BJs was the perfect fit. We had a party of 20 and they were smart to assign two waiters to us. This was a huge help! They even allowed us to decorate the table and bring in a cake. The waiters could not have been more polite or provided better service. It was a very busy night for them, but you couldn't tell. The entire staff was so courteous that it was a wonderful experience for everyone there. Other attendees even mentioned how great the restaurant was throughout the night.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for small or large functions. They don't make you feel like you're a burden having so many people.

Either way you can't go wrong having a pint or pitcher from there.  Food is definitely unique lots of different pizzas and burgers to choose from, pick one along with a beer and you're good.

My other half was a bit disappointed since we missed the first game and had a training session instead for Super Bowl volunteers, since I thought this would help with the football withdrawal and it did. Bad part: We were seated in an area that had several large parties that left and  being cleaned up and ready set for two more large parties.   Waited for 10-15 minutes trying ALL the wait staff in our area to get something to drink. Of course they all walked by as if I wasn't seen. The one server that was supposed to have our table wouldn't acknowledge we were there even if I was naked. Too bad she was the same girl complaining to her boss when we got there about too much work. She wasn't very quiet about it. Good part: Jessica saw me trying to get attention and greeted us and asked if she could get the drinks since the other girl was busy.   Apparently she was assigned or agreed to serve us since after she brought drinks and she let us know she was taking out table. She was friendly and attentive.  Kept the refills coming on the mock tail tea I decided to try. The pizza was smaller than I expected but on second thought was a blessing since it left room for dessert.. Can we say Beignet time? The hubs had the bacon cheeseburger and a Light Switch beer. Almost finished it too but it was well not medium as ordered, cold bun and not skinny fries but the wedges as he wanted but he was too hungry to send it back.

152,Noah T.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,4,,3.0,2015-03-02,"Ok, first I would like to add we have been eating at BJ's (my wife, kids and I) since they opened. We live right up the street and frequent Park West about once a week for dinner and a movie. In the beginning when I very first tried BJ's, they had one of the best burgers I have ever had! I could tell they used high quality beef, quality ingredients- a delicious bun, and were prepared superb. The appetizer was also delicious and original, an avocado egg roll with a delicious dipping sauce. I have also tried the roast beef french dip which was excellent and a chicken tortilla soup to die for. That is why it's such a bummer when the last few times I've been there it has been extremely inconsistent.   When its good its really good, when it's bad, the service is horrible and the food has been lousy. However I never stop going to a place I like so much off of one bad food experience. Upon returning to see if it is really gone downhill like I feared, we were actually pleasantly surprised with our meals. So chalking it up as just an off day, we have gone back several times. I don't know what is going on, maybe it has to do with the manager who may be working at the time, or kitchen staff / wait staff, but it seems to oscillate from being one of my favorite places to go, to extremely poor food and service. When we're looking for a quick bite to eat and don't feel like cooking we'll stop by and have lunch or dinner, but unfortunately it is just too inconsistent. Their drink menu is awesome, and have plenty of microbrews to try. Myself being a fan of root beer, enjoys' their homemade root beer and my children often order they're orange creamsicle soda which is very delicious. They usually order off the children's menu, and the sliders offered on that menu are quite tasty.    The only reason I decided to write a review for BJ's is I honestly hope management can fix the inconsistencies with their dining experience. When their game is tight, it truly is one of my favorite chain restaurants. With how close they are to our house, I look forward to many more years of dining at BJ's,  and would even drive several miles extra to dine there if I had to because it is just that good (when it's good). It makes me very nervous that they will become just like so many other really good restaurants that start out delicious only to have a gradual descent into mediocrity. I just hope they do not become complacent being average, because their food is so much more when they do go the extra mile. I would gladly give 5 stars if the issues I stated above can be rectified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=160,4.0,3.73,3.73,3.436,3.838

Her name is Crystal, the waitress of your dreams. She was attentive, kind, funny, and knew her stuff. She simply looked around the table once and had an idea of what we may want. She noticed there was a gluten-free menu in front of my sister in law and immediately recommended gluten free treats, drinks and meals. My father in law is Spanish speaking and she was able to take his order and give him suggestions in Español. While taking your order, all of her attention is on you and nothing else, maximizing accuracy and ease of communication. After the orders were placed, she repeated all of the orders to each guest with clarity and precision. There was a mix up in the kitchen with our order and she caught it as soon as the order came out, she brought it to us as a complimentary dish to apologize for the mix up and begged our forgiveness for the mistake. Even in the face of adversity Crystal kept her head on a swivel and her eye on the prize. She conducted herself with poise and class. Everything was delicious, the drinks were cold and refreshing, and we had a great time laughing and conversing with not just each other, but with our gracious server, and new friend, Crystal. We will surely stop at this BJ's again on the way back to our beloved San Diego, and if fate will allow it, we will be granted the privilege of being served by Peoria's diamond in the rough; Crystal: The waitress of our dreams.

218,Sheila S.,"Glendale, AZ",0,21,,3.0,2015-04-09,"It appears from other reviews that there is definitely a problem with ""wait time"" here. My daughter and I have been here twice in the past couple of months, both times we chose a high-top table in the middle of the bar area. The first time service was slow, we chalked it up to being in between after lunch and and the very start of happy hour or short on staff. BUT, last night, our service was just plain ole SLOW. Last night we arrived approx 8:00 for dinner. No wait for a high-top table in the bar area but it took a while to for our server to get our initial drink order. She returned, we placed our food order and that's when the wait time got even worse. Our drinks were empty....even our water! She never checked in, kept looking for her and we were about to just leave but we had a hungry little boy who needed his dinner. She finally came to our table with some weird reason why our dinner was delayed, took off real quick and our glasses were still empty. Finally able to get a second round ordered and then our dinner came out. It was hot and delicious....good thing or we would have just left. We were comped on the bill for the delay so the situation was acknowledged. I sure did notice another couple next to us in tables that were seated 30 seconds before us ( I know, I wanted that table but didn't make it in time) were done, served, ate, paid the bill and left before we even had our meal brought to our table.  The food is amazing and delicious and there is a wide selection of beers.

I ordered the grilled tacos last night and got one with grilled fish and one with grilled shrimp. The shrimp tasted awful. Seemed like they were cooked for 20 minutes too long. A piece of leather probaby would have been easier to chew through. The fish was also very over done but was a little easier to stomach than the shrimp.

101,Anth D.,"Phoenix, AZ",101,33,7.0,4.0,2015-07-01,"After Flemings next door decided to close early before their posted hours and one of their employees rudely noticed us through the locked door, turned and walked away, well...  my wife and I were going to head back to Westgate where we normally hang out and celebrate our anniversary at another place known for brewing their own beers.   Being outrageously hungry and bored with their menu, we decided to give BJ's a try, and I'm glad we did.  First of all, the BJ's menu is an employee manual.  Loan document folder.  Car manual.  The thing is huge, and completely disorganized, and flipping through, I became frustrated at the randomness.  I sort of loved and hated it at the same time.  On the other hand, there's something for absolutely everybody in that massive encyclopedia of options, and it's unlikely that even the most ardent of loyal customers will get bored with the selection.  So... +1 on that one, because we'll probably be back a few times.    The deep dish pizza is about the closest thing I've had since leaving southside Chicago quite a number of years ago.  The BJ's special deep dish nailed it!  Deep dish pizza is a favorite of mine.   If that wasn't enough, they had Wyders Pear Cider on tap, which I haven't had since my San Diego days.  It's like my two favorite things in one spot.  We really enjoyed ourselves.   My wife ordered the chocolate chip cookie pan ice cream thing - wow, what a desert.   Two things kept this from being a 5-star.   The ""It's that drink"" drink special tasted awful.  It was like cough syrup, and it doesn't mix.  I expected a lot more, and that drink didn't deliver.  I don't send back drinks as an absolute rule, but I'm confident that if I did at BJ's (unlike some restaurants), my replacement drink would have been treated respectfully.  Still, we just don't send drinks back.  Ever.  The other lost half-star was because the prices were pretty hefty.  We had an appetizer of avocado something-or-others, pizza, dessert and 3 drinks that came up to almost $100 inc tax and tip.   It just seems like a lot of money for a meal.   But we left stuffed, and with leftovers for the next day.    The staff was great.  They really worked together.  Rather than ""this is my section"" type of servers, everyone seemed to genuinely work together and check on the customers.  Having worked as a server for a number of years, this dynamic was both unusual and impressive for a diverse group of people.  Loved watching it.  Loved watching people get along.  Class act!  And everybody, bar none, was professional from the hostess, to the waitress, supervisor, manager and everyone else.    I also notice that management actively reviews and listens to customers.  It shows.  Your staff aims to please, and it shows that you're actively involved.  Nice to see!   We dined on June 26.

They were calling names but the hostesses were not speaking clearly into the intercom or it needs to be fixed. I keep on moving to try to hear the intercom but I simple could not hear. Their voices sounded like they were underwater. When I went up to ask where we were on the list they said they called us. I explained I did not hear them. The hostess responded in a snarky voice, ""Well, you should have received a text message.""  I explained to her I never got it and she rolled her eyes at me. She then responded in annoyance, "" Well, we will see what we can do for you.""  Shortly after, a different hostess sat us, she explained that the intercom is meant for outside not inside and that sometimes they have errors in their text message system. Okay, well not everyone sits outside, It was cold so I was standing inside. My friends wanted to leave before we were even seated because of the lack of the experience of the hostesses. They are the first impression of the restaurant and they should remain respectful to customers even during the Friday dinner rush.  The food was excellent though! As always BJ's food was delicious!

My favorite part is the pizzokies, though. They have so many different flavors in which I still have some to try, but the awesome thing is they have a pizookie the size of a large pizza.

109,Maria M.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,26,3.0,2.0,2016-01-24,"Worst dining experience I've had in a while. We came for the first time on Friday, January 8 at around 6PM for my birthday. I picked it because it looked like it had a few items my picky husband and 6 year old would like. There was a small crowd waiting to be seated when we arrived. The hostess told us the waiting period would be around 35 minutes- not too bad. We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to finally be seated. It seemed like everyone who arrived after us was being seated before us. And from what I saw, most of them seemed to know what to expect from this place. Everyone and their grandma had reservations that night! When we finally did get a table, my husband and I placed an order right away (we had plenty time to memorize the menu during our long wait). Our dinner did not arrive until about 50 minutes later.  My husband ordered a burger and fries. Son ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Both thought the food was decent, nothing to rave about. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and sausage, Jambalaya. It tasted like one of those frozen meals that come in a bag and you can just reheat in a skillet.  Idk what seasoning were in it, but it was definitely overpowering.  I will say that the waitress was attentive and apologetic for the very long wait. She's the only reason I bumped it to 2 stars. She offered us a free salted caramel pazooki (?) I'm so glad I didn't pay for it because it was overly sweet and the cookie was hard as a rock. What a bust! What would have been a little over an hour experience turned out to be around 3 hours long! As a result, we didn't have time to make it to the Star Wars movie we'd planned for after dinner, so we headed back home. We all agreed we'd be crazy to come to this restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=120,3.96,3.9,3.9,3.1440000000000006,3.9240000000000004

After ordering chips and salsa and a round of hand crafted sodas for the table it took a while for the server to come back to take our order. The chips and salsa arrived and the chips were crispy and delicious, the salsa was pretty good as well although we found multiple french fries swimming in the bottom of it, the only thing that would have made them better was more chips as we ate all of the them within 5 minutes of receiving the plate. Next the salads came out and both were tasty, no complaints there. Then we waited for a long time for our food to come out..... My husbands ribs were hot but over done. They were chewy and the outside was crispy and hard to eat. I ordered the ziti, which was not the smallest I've seen but not huge either. The noodles were okay but some were either undercooked or burnt because they were very crunchy. The sauce was pretty tasty but not much better than a store bought and there was so little meat that I could hardly find it.

Mondays are half off pizza so I ordered the classic combo and it was very disappointing. The crust was thick, nice and soft, but the toppings were terrible. The crust is so thick you have to overcook the toppings to finish the dough. It was so bad the sauce was dried under the cheese and the amount of oil/grease used in the pan is insane.

I read tons of yelp reviews before going here with a group outing - and got scared away from the fish. My buddy had the cherry chipotle salmon and said it was great. I didn't want to run the risk of a crappy meal. I had the buffalo burger, and while the meat and cook were decent enough - what made this dish so good was the barbecue sauce, pico de gallo, and grilled green chiles that were topping it. Seriously, amazing. The cole slaw that came with it was less than desirable haha, but I still a few days later now cannot get over how good the sauce and condiments for that burger were.

49,Anita N.,"Avondale, AZ",28,133,70.0,2.0,2016-06-06,"Food has always been above average here but the manager here (tall, older man) isn't so friendly! Have a seat, here is why: Being the techies we are we were excited to see that they had a mobile app now where you can pay your check with Apple Pay! The waiter dropped off the ticket but all we had to do was pull up our table number, check out, and was emailed the receipt fairly quickly.  I then opened the check on the table and noticed a different amount than what I had paid. The waiter simply forgot to add on an extra Coke and did so last minute that it didn't update in the app. I notified the waiter and was thinking all we owed was the extra $3 for the soft drink and would have been fine paying that separately. The waiter went to see what was going on but the manager returned. He started by suggesting possibly doing a second charge on the physical card to see if it actually went through and if I ended up getting charged twice then they'd refund one. I frowned upon that simply because I'm not going to make another large charge on my card just to ""see what happens"". I pulled up the receipt that was emailed to me by BJ's showing everything I paid for, it was just short the $3 drink.  The manager then sat down next to me at our booth, without asking, to look at my phone. I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable because there was really no room for him so his arm and leg were brushing right up against mine. It was so unprofessional and a complete invasion of privacy and I shot a horrified look at my boyfriend on the other side. Quickly I showed him the email on my phone hoping he would be satisfied and move away from me, but it was like he had never seen an email like that before...I had to explain that it was sent front BJ's and where it said I used Apple Pay.  I even offered to show him my bank account...something I shouldn't have to do or feel that I should defend myself with but we weren't going to be painted as thieves. At this point he was still rudely hovering over my phone I had to obviously turn my phone away so he wouldn't see me entering in my credentials. He finally got the hint and got up to go check to see if it was showing as paid in the system yet.  I pulled up my account and sure enough it was showing as being taken out and pending, it was incredibly awkward once again to have to show a view of my account transactions and prove we were not trying to skip out on the check. Sorry but I'm not going to charge my card again when we have all kinds of proof showing we've paid and we weren't trying to screw anyone over. The manager simply said ""well it's not showing as cleared so I'm just going to have to eat the check..."" and as I was about to speak he walked off without another word. We just sat there in silence for a bit as the manager stared at us from the front desk.  Sir...you're not ""eating the check"" as you passive aggressively stressed to us. You got paid, the money didn't just go into oblivion from my bank account, the BJ email receipt confirmed it, you were just short $3 for the Coke which we were happy to pay for on a different ticket. The waiter, a kinder soul, came back a few minutes later and I gave him the quick rundown of what happened because I certainly didn't want him getting the blame for the last minute addition. He went back to check the register and BOOM it was now cleared and he said that we were all good. It just took a little time to get updated apparently but the manager clearly lost his cool early and lacked a sense of boundaries with customers.  After an already long day and wanting to just sit down and get a good meal somewhere nice it was a real disappointment to then be hassled for something that was no fault of our own. We were the ones that brought up the issue and asked what we could do to remedy it not expecting the manager and how we'd ultimately get treated. I was just happy to be done with something that could have easily been solved...a measly $3!!! It wasn't that hard.  Will be reaching out to corporate regarding the personal space issue though, an apology from the manager would have been nice at least as we left.  We've come here for many birthdays and get togethers, however this customer experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be recommending this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=60,3.68,3.86,3.86,3.2720000000000002,3.7880000000000003

I can honestly say, I truly enjoy the ambiance at BJ's. The menu at BJ's is varried, offering a large selection of beers, cocktails, and entrée's, there is something for everyone at BJ's. If you can't find something at BJ's to eat,  then you don't like to eat.  The burgers at BJ's are delicious and one of my favorite entrée's, but if burgers are not your thing, BJ's offers plenty of other options.  The Thyme-Lemon Chicken and Steaks are amazing and grilled to perfection, with a  a bit of char, tender, and so flavorful. Service is reliable and well-timed. The staff is very accomdating without being intrusive.  Table or bar seating are all good and their to-go service works well, too.  If your looking for a nice dining expeirence give BJ's Restraunt and Brewery a try, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria,3.84,3.92,3.92,3.472,3.888

214,Wallie L.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",0,9,,1.0,2016-07-20,"My one star rating has nothing to do with the food, which was very good, and everything to do with the manager of the evening, Amber, during our experience at BJ's on Saturday, July 16.  We were coming to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend.  I phoned ahead to get on the list for a table.  I specifically requested a table because my husband and I have disabilities that limit our movement and make it nearly impossible to maneuver ourselves into and out of a booth.  The hostess assured me that a table would be made available for us.  When my buzzer went off, Amber said our space was ready, but that it was a booth.  I explained that we required a table and she insisted that the booth can accommodate us because of the pullout section for seating.  As we approached the booth we saw an empty table for 4 and asked why we could not have that space.  She explained that she needed it and that as soon as the people in the table next to that one left, she would be setting it up for someone else.  Mind you, the people at the other table were in no way ready to move on and had settled in nicely for a good dinner with friends.  We sat down at the empty table and refused to get up because the space was available for us and we wanted that space for our dinner.  Amber was extremely rude and upset that we would not take the booth and kept repeating to us that she ""needs that table"".  The hostess attempted to give us our menus and Amber told her ""NO"" because she ""needs that table"".  Along comes the waitress assigned to the table, Christa, and we explained to her what was going on.  She was a delight and offered to get us something to drink while the table fiasco was sorted out.  Seeing that the table next to us was clearly not leaving, we asked her to bring us menus and we ordered our appetizer and dinner.  To be clear, an hour later that group next to us was still enjoying their time together.  I don't know what Amber's issue was, but she needs some intense training on customer service as she could not have been more rude and unprofessional if she tried.  We have never had an experience like this at BJ's, nor any other restaurant we've dined at.  We thank Christa for her excellent service and enjoyed our dinners.  It will, however, be some time before we frequent the Peoria location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria?start=180,3.88,3.9,3.9,3.204,3.8920000000000003

They really over baked the bread bowl and it was dark near burnt and very crusty. They should never have delivered to the table. I got the the spicy pig pizza and my wife got the old country tomato basil. She ordered extra artichoke. Just a little advice When someone orders an extra topping out it on top so they can see it. At first she returned it because you could not really see but it was there and she did enjoy. We got biegnets for dessert and there were very good.  Service was excellent and attentive.

Server walked by and would smile but nothing. So we waited.....and waited....for a side salad mind you. After 20 - 30 minutes of waiting I approached the server and told her we needed to leave and asked her to please adjust the bill accordingly. So we wait.....and wait.....and wait....then guess what shows up... the side salad at the same time as our entree's. (Same server had both burgers and the salad). 45 MINUTES AFTER WE ORDERED Told him the situation so he took the food back, left 14$ on the table (we added the price of the mushrooms and our 2 sodas + tax and a lil on top just in case my math was off) and left.

I called the store to ask them about it and spoke to a man. He said that he can't see anything yet because it is sent through Uber Eats first then sent to them. I asked him if I should call back after it's delivered. He said yes but he would talk to the manager to see if they know why it's happening and he would call me back if he found anything out. The food was delivered and was great. I called back and asked for a manager. They got the manager on the phone and I told him what happened and that I called earlier. He said that he was the person I talked to earlier and he is still only showing one charge. I was a little confused because when I called the first time he told me he has to talk to a manager and now he's saying he's a manager. He said to wait a few days to see if one of the charges drops off and if it doesn't to call back. I'm hoping this gets figured out but I'm a little bothered by getting the runaround.

The appetizers were great, we had the avocado spring rolls and the calamari. The drinks were amazing; I had a strawberry blast and the little lady had a bahama mama. The main course! We both had different styles of fish tacos but they were fantastic. And then a little dessert, man that thing was tasty, a little on the small side but that's ok. It was great.  We will definitely be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria,3.92,3.81,3.8,,3.854

Everything was wonderful...from the easy online ordering to the friendly driver, Rochelle, to the really nice packaging of their delivered food. Also, the food was still hot and very good!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I had ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was supposed to come with creamy horseradish...there wasn't any.  But, it was still tasty and I ate the whole thing.

They have great healthy options as well, but boy they sure did satisfy the cravings we were having for some delicious food!  We started with the extreme pepperoni flat bread. It was so good! Crispy crust, two different style pepperonis! It wasn't too greasy and it was quite large.  We then split their crispy chicken sandwich! That bun.... It was so light and airy! It had pickle and the best honey mustard sauce ever. The chicken was so crispy! Last but definitely NOT least was dessert. I can honestly say that I have found my new most favorite dessert ever. Drum roll please...... The peanut butter smore cookie was the absolute best! It was a chocolate cookie with peanut butter and then toasted marshmallow on top!!!! Oh. My. Gosh!! It was so sweet but I couldn't stop eating it! It was SO SO good!  Just dreaming about it now makes my crave it!

He was completely honest with us on the orders and was always super attentive. Now to the food, oh man, it was great! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs the first time and I honestly thought the portion would be small considering it is small in some other places, but you really get enough for what you spend. My boyfriend got the Southern Comfort and now orders it every single time we go. I also tried the chicken alfredo without broccoli and it was delicious! I loved the fact that the chicken was not as dry as some other places. I also tried the boneless buffalo and was not disappointed either.  The pazooki was the greatest part though; if it's your first time and you have a sweet tooth, you need to try the Pazooki!

1,Bryan F.,"Phoenix, AZ",179,217,178.0,3.0,2017-12-05,"So, this was an interesting experience.  First of all, I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants with massive menus.  Now, that being said, the experience was OK.  I had the spicy pig, which was good, but made incorrectly.  When asked to fix the order, the waiter brought back the same, burnt, flatbread with the added topping, uncooked, place on top.  Now the topping was only pineapple, so there was no issue with this being raw.   My server was nice, but I have to say my table was shocked when we found out he had been there a year.  He was very wrinkled and did not seem to know the menu well.  He brought me back my flatbread in that condition and then asked if it was OK or if it should be remade.  I just feel that it was not the experience I would expect from a high end Chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria,4.0,3.87,3.828,,3.922

I would normally complain and say a restaurant should specialize in something, but in my 4 visits, I haven't had anything that was good.  Burgers, salads, flatbreads... even pasta, all were solid.  Only reason for four stars is because it feels a little too-""chainy"" but that is unavoidable. Certainly a step up from TGI Fridays and Applebees, but the over the top menu and decor just don't do it for me. Service has always been exceptional and the facility is perfect for large parties, prices are competitive, and I will definitely be back, especially when I cannot decide what I'm really in the mood to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-peoria,4.08,3.87,3.836,,3.954
