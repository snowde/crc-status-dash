235,Renee W.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,78,,2.0,2012-01-21,"This is one of those cookie cutter type of place where you see your typical beer drinking crowd, your typical menu with not much surprise, and typical chained restaurant quality,  with your typical server trying rush you out of the door.   Nothing really out of the world but consistency is their best quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=240,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.1440000000000006,3.84
162,Todd H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",22,287,386.0,3.0,2012-01-22,"To explain my rating, please remember that 3 stars means A-OK, it is not a bad rating, but it doesn't mean excellent either. A group of 9 of us stopped there just after 8 PM on a Saturday night.  One would think being able to get in to a restaurant at Desert Ridge on a Saturday night would not be easy but they seated us immediately.  The place was full but not packed.  It was a pleasure to go to a place that is not so noisy that you can't have a conversation with the others in your group.  I think part of that is that BJ's was designed with good acoustics.  We were surrounded by other diners but the noise level was well tolerable. Our waitress was generally pleasant, but we agreed she looked bored, or even upset. She messed up numerous times throughout the meal in taking orders and bringing the right items.  Again, the place wasn't that busy that she was overloaded. As far as the food is concerned, I give BJ's high marks.  I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants (although BJ's isn't as huge a chain as Olive Garden for example).  The menu is creative and varied and surprisingly inexpensive.  Most of us started with a beer, and we all liked the featured selection. Although BJ's originally started as primarily a pizza place, they now offer a lot of different types of foods, many of which are not usually found in restaurants of this type.  None of us had Italian food however.  My choice was Cajun Talapia, two large filets cooked as perfectly as you can imagine, over a bed of rice and seved with a spring salad.  The entre was served with a half lemon that was blackened at one end, perfect to squeeze on the fish and salad, resulting in a low calorie meal.  Although the entre was under $10 the quantity of food was quite filling. Others in our party had burgers, jambalaya, thai shrimp lettuce wraps and a nice Ahi Poke, all of which looked delicious.  Everyone in our group agreed the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  Our only negative was that the waitress wasn't that great. BJ's is a cut above the typical chain restaurant but not at a higher price.  Just an informal place to enjoy a decent meal with family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=200,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.308,3.84

I've been here for several lunch meetings and each time I think 'eh they're having an off day, next time will be better'. That's not the case. Every time I've been here (and it's only ever been for lunch), service is slow, servers seem confused and too busy (even though there are dozens of them on staff), there have been poor explanations of the dishes, food was served barely warm and of mediocre taste.  The restaurant does always seem to be busy though, so apparently other people have had different experiences - good for them.  ... On a lighter note, the beer is delicious. I've had the Pale Ale and the Red which both awesome.

145,Nick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",72,46,11.0,4.0,2012-06-05,"As a large chain I will say that I am a fan of BJ's. One of the nice things is that this location is just like every other location, in that its the same menu and same food.  One thing that i love about BJ's is that I have always had good service, they do a great job of training and making sure that it is done right. Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their ""craft"" beers they are hit or miss. As a huge fan of a good beer I cant say I love BJ's brews but they also offer a decent other selection. When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The ""deep dish"" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious! Best part about all the food i will say is the pizookie, i love the pizookie! you have to try it.  Overall, BJ's is good a little bit pricey for what you get but they do a quality job on all the food and service and are fairly consistent in all their locations. Good place to go for a family dinner, beers with some friends, or just a place to go and have a decent meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=180,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.44,3.6000000000000005

I am newly gluten free and they have limited menu options for a GF person like me although I do appreciate that they offer a GF pizza. I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad. It was certainly nothing special considering the $12 price tag. I was disappointed to see that all their salads ran that much with the exception of the garden salad which was $9.75 + $3 extra to add grilled chicken. They've really increased their prices. My husband's vanilla Dr. Pepper was $3 and he was not offered a refill.

The fish and chips are above average, and the size of the dish is large. My wife and I often split it. The potato skins are good as well, nice large crispy potato skins with cheese and bacon. They are not soggy and shriveled like at some places (Fridays....) I order the burger often, and it is above average. The crispy thin fries are excellent. I have had a few friends eat the steaks here, and they both enjoyed them. They have a strawberry shortcake like desert that is very, very good as well.  All and all, a well rounded place to eat.

159,Michael Z.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,125,5.0,5.0,2012-08-21,Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive.   We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty.  We had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too.  I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat.  Again bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding.

270,Michael D.,"Mesa, AZ",48,44,15.0,2.0,2012-10-17,"First the good: I love the fact that as a business, BJ's supports groups like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is doing things in October for breast cancer awareness. I like that they have good seasonal brews - the pumpkin ale was quite tasty. They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around. However. The quality of the service keeps us from making this place a regular stop. It's just so sporadic - sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's sub-par like today. We were greeted warmly, our server (Erica A) came quickly and when asked for an additional minute returned quickly to take our order. This is where it all fell apart. After taking our order, we saw her only once more before paying our check. I know our $25 order wasn't laden with lucrative alcohol - but no refills on water, showing disappointment when only one of us ordered more than water, having to flag a bus boy for silverware while our appetizer got cold, watching the manager watch the football game more than the service - it all just sours us from coming more frequently.

269,Bill J.,"Glendale, AZ",44,173,660.0,4.0,2012-12-30,"I've been going to this location off and on for a couple of years now, typically for lunch with friends, colleagues or family, and it's never really disappointed me.  I'm a huge fan of their tomato soup, greasy though it might be sometimes, it is nonetheless delicious and I always have to have it. My only gripe is that their idea of a 'bowl' of soup is basically a coffee mug, not an actual bowl. If you're hungry, make sure you order the bowl or you'll probably only get about a shot glass worth from the 'cup' version.  For the lunch specials, my favorite has long been the chicken fettuccine, which has always been good, although I must admit I've had mixed experience with the pulled pork sandwich and the blonde shrimp, both a tying for a close second. Both the pork and the shrimp I've gotten in bad form a few times, not wretch inducing or anything, but it's definitely been sub-par from time to time (tough pork, badly battered shrimp, etc.). I've always gotten a sincere apology when things go awry and offers to make it right, but I have to hand it to them that there's never been an issue with the pasta or the chicken therein, so I keep my fingers crossed and stick with that these days.   If I'm not in the mood for pasta, my new second favorite is to go with their BBQ chicken pizza, another item that they've managed to be very consistent with. Probably not the best pizza out there, but for the money, it's certainly par for the course.  Service is typically pretty good, but if they're packed for lunch, you can generally expect the drink service to fall off the radar. This has been a consistent theme, regardless of who our server is, but it's hard to blame them when the place is packed. They definitely fill up quick around lunch time, so get there early if you want brisk service!  On the whole, I've no issues going back to this place. I haven't gotten any serious complaints from anyone I've taken here, whether they're friends, coworkers or visiting family members, so that says a lot. I'll definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.248,3.7200000000000006

WTF? Then we had a third server take our food order! It just made us dizzy and each one seemed more confused then the last. The second visit was better however, I overheard the table next to us complain because they didn't get the extra garlic bread they ordered until the meal was done.

161,Meredith W.,"Glendale, AZ",291,13,1.0,1.0,2013-09-07,"My boyfriend decided that he wanted to have his 22nd birthday dinner at Bj's, it made sense because we were going to Dave and Busters afterwards. I called about four days in advance to make a reservation for 15 people at 8:15pm. I spoke with a manager and everything was worked out. We arrived a little early, around 8, and were told that our reservation had been changed to 8:30. This was unbeknownst to me which was irritating because they had my number on file and I had 15 hungry people showing up expecting to be seated at 8:15. Well, unfortunately this was just the start of things! We didn't ACTUALLY sit down at 8:30, we didn't even get seated at 9! We sat down to eat dinner around 9:15, PERFECT! By this point most of us were tired and mostly just wanted to go home. Personally I didn't even care about the fact that I was hungry anymore. So they assigned two servers to our table because we were such a large party which made me happy, I thought that would mean better service oh boy was I wrong! Our drinks took 20 minutes to come out, seriously? So we all put our order in and instead of entering all of our orders AT ONE TIME in the computer our servers entered them at randomly different times so all of our food came out randomly. Now let me add that everyone in this party has either served or worked in the restaurant industry before and we all know that when there's two of you, bringing 15 people drinks and appetizers should NEVER take 20-30 minutes. Now as far as the food goes, EH. Mediocre at best. The Long Islands were ten dollars and they tasted like shit. I had a five dollar Mai Tai and it was probably the most delicious thing I had all night! The ONLY thing I can give them credit for is their spinach artichoke dip, that was heavenly. Now we had all planned on leaving Bj's around 10:30 because Dave and Busters closes at one on Fridays. We didn't even get our checks until 11. SHOCKING. So we didn't end up walking out the front doors until 11:30. I was furious to say the least.

I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.

Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no ""love"" put into this sandwich would be an understatement. Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable. Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.

I have been to this BJs location quite a few times, but had a pretty good experience when I last went here yesterday. I went with my family kind of early which was nice, because we just beat the rush! We were seated right away, and our server was kind and did a good job. To start off we ordered mozzarella sticks. I can be picky when it comes to my m-sticks, but these ones were incredibly good, was hard not to eat all of them. Didn't come with enough marinara sauce. One great thing about BJs is the massive menu, there are so many amazing options to choose from, it is hard! On Sunday I was struggling between going for the Avocado Eggrolls (used to order these all the time back in high school) or the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. My mom and I decided we would get both of them and then split them! I hate to say it, but the Avocado Eggrolls just were not near as good as I had remembered them.

The Calamari was breaded perfectly, but was a bit chewy. The Ahi Tuna Poke was just ok. The Tuna's texture was a bit off. I also ordered a Black and Bleu Burger.

All in all, everything was very solid until................... We got our check!!! $8.25 for 1 shot of FireBall!!! OMG!!!! Are you out of your mind??? By far the most expensive shot of Fireball I have ever had in my life! Seriously? FireBall is one of the least expensive non-well bottles at the bar.  My friend owns a bar, and said he pays $6/750ml for FireBall and I pay $19/1.75L at Costco. I completely understand making a profit, but this was just insane!

There weren't any drink specials offered when we were there, but they do have a nice selection of drinks to choose from. I enjoyed a mojito, while my girl had a long-island iced tea.  Our server was super friendly, very accommodating and he took his time serving us so we could relax and not feel ""rushed"" to eat and leave. I ended up ordering their baked ziti and it was very good. The portion size was surprisingly small given the portions of their other plates.  For the two of us, a couple drinks each and dinner set me back nearly $70 (including a coupon for $10 off that my girlfriend had). I felt that for a chain restaurant, that was a bit high. I almost thought I was overcharged, but didn't feel like reviewing everything so I just took the hit end left.

We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us.  The manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates.

The server (with disclaimer that he has never been to Chicago) suggested the Californian-Chicago style pizza. We were hungry so it filled a void, but I would never call it Chicago style.

This time I tried a new item - the Late Night Burger.  Here's the description: Open-faced burger | housemade pork chile verde | Applewood smoked bacon | jack + cheddar cheese | fresh fried egg  I really should have taken a picture.  When I think of an open-faced burger I don't think of both buns laid out with a patty covering the middle.  If that were the case, I'd hope that the buns were smothered in the pork chile verde.  Unfortunately there was a good 2"" on either side of the burger + toppings of plain bun, rendering the open-faced concept quite questionable.  I'd happily eat it with a closed bun because this presentation did nothing for it. I ordered it medium (pink) with a sunny side egg.  They weren't extremely busy at the time, however my burger was well done with a fried egg that was practically over-hard. Overall the dish was a disappointment, having so much unused bread and it not cooked properly.

The food was very flavorful, and not disappointing in any aspect. They have a portobello mushroom salad topped with goat cheese and cranberries that just exploded with flavor. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, don't even get me started. The bread bowl was toasted, I mean toasted golden brown awesomeness with clam chowder that definitely had plenty of clams in it.

The service started strong, but declined as the night continued. The server became increasingly irritable throughout the night. It could have been a bad night, understandable. When we go out we like to relax and take our time- a departure from regular life. So the kicker for us was that the server dropped the check before the dessert even arrived and continued to point out that the check was there. I get it- you want to turn your table, but this was inappropriate.  I would think that this isn't company policy to rush their guests out the door.  Assuming that this is just a fluke we will probably be back because the food was delicious.  Update: So hubby and I returned to indulge my preggo craving of potato skins. I read an article that featured BJs in the top 10 of potato skins in Phx, so I was sold. Soooooooo glad that we did. Those little nuggets of carbs and fat were delectable. My little boy was dancing in utero out of gratitude. Our server, Erin I think, was fantastic. She appeared swamped but handled it like a pro.

We waited another 15 minutes after we were finished eating just for him to get done talking to his coworker and pick up our check.

We are disappointed after tonight's visit and unfortunately will never return. Things have gone downhill for the last year but have been really bad the last several months. We miss the excellent personable waitstaff and management that used to run this restaurant. Other reviewers have recently talked about the food coming out COLD and lacking in quality control. After waiting an hour, the first time our food came out, it was obvious it had been sitting there for awhile. The mushroom appetizer was cold, the lettuce wrap appetizer had cold chicken and the jambalaya was luke warm. We asked for the food to be remade from scratch because mushrooms taste horrible warmed up in a microwave. Then the food came out again 30 minutes later and the food was the same, not hot! The manager on duty argued with us saying he personally witnessed the cook making it and he kept saying it was hot although he refused to touch my mushroom when I asked him to in order to feel how cold it was. He then accused us of ""always"" complaining when we have been there literally over 200 times and he has only been managing for a month or so. And here is where I have an issue, he slipped and said, ""do you want me to warm these up AGAIN"" when he just had said he had the cook remake the dishes from scratch and witnessed it. He was overly condescending and not friendly at all. We miss the manager Gunner who was so personable and had excellent control over the restaurant! He made it feel like a tight knit family atmosphere and made an effort to come talk to us every time we came and knew us by name.
