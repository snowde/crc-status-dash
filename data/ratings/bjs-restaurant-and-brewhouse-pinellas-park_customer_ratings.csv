240,N.C. F.,"St Petersburg, FL",0,45,27.0,4.0,2012-01-16,"I really like the uniqueness of BJ's.  I've used it for business as well as social meals and my guests have always been pleased.  The menu choices are plentiful and served in pleasing table settings.  It is one big room so it can tend to be noisy, and oftentimes if you are not there before noon, there is a wait.  The lounge is at the end of the dining area but quite large.   There is a take-out area which speeds things up if you care to dine that way. They frequently offer specials if you sign up for their email list.  The pizza is good, as are the ""tapas"" type menu items.  And...if you have a sweet tooth, you'll surely be tempted!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=240,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408
158,Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",358,1149,1892.0,3.0,2012-01-20,"BJ's is better than a lot of chain restaurants, but it's still a chain restaurant.  The menu is huge and the food is good (good, not great).  I think the best things on the menu are the meatloaf sandwich and the pizza. The salads can be hit or miss depending or the freshness of the ingredients.  The restaurant does get very busy on the weekends, especially if a game is on. BJ's offers a nice sized bar, friendly waitresses, plenty of large screen tv's.  The food is reasonably priced, but the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  I was not too impressed with my martini.  A little too sweet, I didn't care for the aftertaste that the mixer left.  Would something more basic like a rum and coke next time or stick with beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=120,3.34,3.34,3.34,3.34,3.3400000000000003

I  did not have a high expectation for this place for the fact it is a chain restaurant.   The parking lot was pretty full and there were a lot of people inside considering it was a Monday night.  Our waitress was attentive and the food was good too!  I like their menu has varieties....now they are offering Asian fusion!  I also like their mini appetizer...perfect size!  Does not fill you up like regular appetizers before your entire. The food came out pretty quick...probably like 5 minutes after ordering though the place was not slow.   Very reasonably priced menu!  I would definitely  like to go back there again :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=120,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472

181,Fulano D.,"Tampa, FL",14,63,66.0,1.0,2012-06-13,"Went to lunch today with my wife. First,  her Ahi tuna salad had an additional dressing poured over the tuna which made it very spicy.  The menu does not indicate this and she can't eat food like that due to health reasons. I asked for my salad dressing on the side as I always do for a variety of reasons, including no spiciness. I received my salad drenched in dressing. I ate it anyways to not have to wait like my wife was. The waitress, a petite middle aged Latin female, was absent and we had to get the manager to help.  She waited and I waited as well to eat with her. Later the waitress said the salad would be comped.  We said great, thank you. When the check finally came, it  was in fact comped.   When the card came back  it was for another table, for a different amount but my card was put through already by the time I noticed. I reported this to our absent waitress and she then took a  long time consulting with the manager, a short w/m heavy set with a shaved head.  I approached them at the cash register and asked what was the holdup.  Since this was lunch and we had things to do, other than a two hour lunch. Rule #1 Mr Manager: do not cop an attitude with the customers. That is what he did.  This guy asked me what was wrong with a tone that implied, I'm about to kick your ass.   I told him the litany of problems and also told him the waitress was not good at her job.   He said, ""that's very rude"".  I said that is the truth and I am the customer. The manager returned my card and said this is on the house. He gave me the card brusquely and I left.  later I found I was in fact charged for the original wrong amount so nothing was comped. Overall,   the food menu does not explain sauces well for people with  spice issues.  The staff needs training, my waitress had communications issues in English.  That and her lack of attentiveness. The thuggish manager needs to chill out and realize if one goes into the food business to treat customers better and with civility, not like a bouncer at a baseball game.  I will not go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9160000000000004,3.5200000000000005

232,Marie-Noelle C.,"St Petersburg, FL",20,11,,3.0,2012-11-20,"So this is a place that I go to for lunch mostly because their lunch menu is reasonable and not bad in terms of food offerings. However, if I do go I definitely need to be there shortly after they open because the service can be a tad slow and working with a hour lunch and 10 min drive cuts into food time. The menu in general is huge ala cheesecake factory which makes deciding on anything quickly not likely. But in terms of the lunch menu it's pared down to a page. I like the salmon because it comes with steamed veggies and pilaf and I get it blackened. However, I've been getting the southern fried chicken which is not so bad with the corn succotash over mashed potatoes and pretty crispy chicken breast.

Things I ordered which I would NOT order again- Sweet Pig Pizza (very dry, lacking sauce and needs more cheese toppings) Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad Angel Hair Toscana (very bland, taste like you are eating just a plain bowl of noodles, not enough sauce in this dish) Chicken A La Fresca (nothing special)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=200,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.152,3.6400000000000006
167,Jessica J.,"St Petersburg, FL",36,162,1.0,3.0,2012-12-20,"This review is based solely on food.. have not experienced their brewhouse offerings. At first I totally loved this place. It's really quite nice inside. I love that they offer chicken lettuce wraps for the carb-conscious diners. They have an awesome selection of small bite appetizers for 3 dollars!! And the portions for those items are actually quite generous. Most restaurants don't do this. The tomato mozzarella salad was so amazing. The menu is quite a lot to digest.  Their in-house made sodas are AMAZING!!! Especially the root beer and the orange cream. I don't drink soda, but I downed that orange cream like nobody's biznazzzz. (Beware of the black cherry.. I didn't personally try it but our server claimed it tastes like Robitussin.) Last time I came here, though, I was a bit disappointed. But disclaimer.. they are known for their pizzas. I did not order a pizza. So maybe one ought to stick to the specialty item. I had some pasta chicken and the chicken kinda tasted like some frozen crap meat... similar to Olive Garden's chicken. No thank you.  Also tried their famous Pizookie, a decent sized cookie in a pizza pan, soft and gooey with ice cream on top. Look folks, I'm half Jewish, but there's nothing ""halfsies"" about the sweet tooth I inherited. I live for cookies. Especially warm gooey cookies. But this chocolate chip dessert was even too sweet for me. Just too artificial and not enough home baked goodness. Same with the vanilla ice cream on top.. It was very artificial tasting. I don't know how else to describe it. You can taste the difference between a Haagen Daaz vanilla bean and this frozen garbage. I don't mean to be so harsh.. but for something they are apparently well known for, I was incredibly disappointed. On a plus side, I sampled the chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was totally delicious. I usually can't stand non-traditional flavored pizzas, but they knocked this out of the park. Also the service has always been absolutely superb! Thank you to James for your very knowledgeable recommendations.  I will be back again.. for pizza and appetizers only! And also because it's right by Marshall's, which I cannot get enough of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=160,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.0520000000000005,3.6400000000000006

Enough tv's so you can catch a score and a few plays without being in your face everywhere. A bit loud, typical sportsbar volume.

208,Chad U.,"St Petersburg, FL",40,161,,4.0,2013-01-06,"BJ's is like an upscale sports bar that brews their own brands of several types of draft beer. The dinning area is pretty much one large room where you can watch the large TV screens from pretty much any seat in the house. The food is not typical bar food. The flat bread pizza's are unique and solid. The Nutty Brewnette is a tasty draft ale. And I'd recommend capping your meal off with a pizookie for your kid (and yourself!). I've been there about 10 times and don't ever recall having a terrible service experience. Nothing extraordinary but nothing so bad that I never wanted to come back.  I want to give this place 5 stars but the reality is that I stay away from it because of the crowd. It's located in a shopping mall that has a 20+ movie theater across the parking lot. Because of the varying movie times, it feels like it's ALWAYS crowded there. They have plenty of seating but the demand is so high, I think the area could support another one easy. The parking lot is small, so if you're going during peek hours, I'd recommend not even bothering with the lot around the building. Just park in the shopping mall lot and walk over to save yourself the hassle. Another tip that I'm reluctant to share.. there's plenty of ""in the bar"" seating and it's comfortable too. Keep an eye out for someone leaving a hop on that table!  Yes, it's a chain but they have a good business model.

They do not take reservations, but they do call ahead - so keep that in mind if you are coming with a group. I believe you can grab a table in the bar area with no wait - so keep your eye out for any openings there. Service can be hit or miss. We have had some really great servers, but others try to rush you because they want to turnover your table as fast as they can.  BJ's has great pizza. I usually stick with the mini deep dish pizza. They also offer a new hand tossed crust, flatbreads, and gluten free pizza,They have a huge variety of non-pizza items on the menu and they are all just ""ok."" I am a firm believer that when you have too much of a variety on a menu, nothing is that great. That's the problem with BJ's menu- It can be overwhelming because it's too big. You can get everything from meatloaf, to pasta, to fish and burgers, and a lot in between. They do have great desserts! They are known for the Pizookie which is an individual fresh baked dessert, like a chocolate chip cookie or brownie, topped with ice cream.

188,Fred S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,4,,4.0,2013-04-18,"I haven't been to a BJ's since I lived in California. I was excited to find out that one was so close by.  Called up a buddy and off we were.  We stopped in on a Thursday night around 8pm and the place was packed. We didn't want to sit at the bar as we were both starving and wanted a table to eat at. Lucky for us there wasn't a wait for 2 tops. If your going with a party I suggest calling ahead. As we were walking in we overheard a group of 8 or so complaining about waiting for 30+ minutes. What do you expect when the place is packed?   I wish I remembered our servers name. She was absolutely phenomenal and hands down some of the best service I've received in awhile. Believe me, you can have the best food in town but if the service isn't there I won't be a customer , so it's very rare for me to enjoy service such as this. It was personable and over the top from start to finish just the way it should be. The food itself is good (not great). I know their known for their pizza but I wanted something different. The menu is huge so be prepared to do some studying before you order. We started with the avocado egg rolls. Those things are awesome. The sauce that they serve with them is the best part. For the entree I got the rib eye. Yes I know, this isn't a steakhouse. It was what to be expected. Nothing to write home about but didn't leave a bit on the plate either.  Another awesome thing is their beer. I'm not a big drinker but tonight I decided to go for it. I mean after all thats partly what their known for. My buddy and I each got their sampler set which is 8 5 oz beers ranging from their lightest to their darkest. I'm not a big fan of stouts but whatever they were serving was actually decent. Hands down the nutty brunette was the best.

Our waitress was spectacular.  We said we were in a hurry and she got us in and out of there in a little over half an hour.   I got the Thai mango chicken salad under their Enlightened menu.  I like that they have an Enlightened menu, so you know that what you're eating is relatively healthy.  It actually worries me then about how unhealthy the rest of the menu is!  The salad had a good amount of chicken and avocado.  It was pretty good, but I would probably try something different next time. My fiance got the Chicken Marsala.  The chicken is really tender.  He really enjoyed it, but he didn't think the green beans really added anything.

The crispy fried artichokes were tasty, lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Served with lemon garlic aioli which was just OK. I preferred the artichokes with a squirt of lemon juice. Both of these small plates/bites were under $5.  The New Orleans Jambalaya with blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce was served over a rice pilaf and topped with green onions.

It was accompanied by toasted garlic bread and topped with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. The plate came out very hot and the angel hair pasta was not overcooked which is one of my greatest pet peeves when it comes to pasta. The dish itself was not overly dressed with the sauce and I respected that. I do realize that this is a massive chain restaurant, but I was disappointed to see the shrimp that came with it were of the quarter-sized frozen variety. I mean, we are in Florida after all.  I also had the orange twist drink which was decent; I normally don't drink soda or soda cocktails but it wasn't too overpowering with the carbonation or the sweetness.

I never stopped in to BJ's, as I assumed it was more along the lines of all the other sporty, general-menu chains. Well, it's not. BJ's seems to meet the allusive combination of quality and quantity. Their menu is of the Cheesecake Factory variety, in that, it's a really expansive list of selections. And everything I had... was super solid. I was *this* close to ordering a pumpkin beer before I called an audible. and went with a diet Coke. I was trying to be healthy... and even kept myself in-check with an ahi tuna salad. I basically never order a salad at a restaurant... once I've decided to go out to eat, I'm almost always going to become a calorie intake machine.  My first experience in being a good kitty, was actually a pleasant surprise. The ahi tuna salad was amazing, and it felt incredible to resist temptation and eat clean. Then, the pizzokie happened. My dining partner is a regular at BJ's (TWSS) and shared her knowledge of the golden plate of food that is a pizzokie. It's a giant cookie in a deep dish pizza tray, covered with ice cream. And yes, it's better than a winning Powerball ticket. We had the macadamia nut, and it literally made me feel like a better human being.

Lots of flavors going on with the shrimp lettuce wraps. And they all melded together very well. Avocado spring rolls were crunchy and creamy. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was huge! I had to cut into fours to eat it. Pork was nicely marinated and the crunchy fried onion topping gave it a nice crunch. A beignet was ordered for dessert. I was too full to try it but everyone else at the table said it was good. Service was ok. A bit slow and lots of ""where's the waitress?"" at one point. She came and apologized though- had a spill happen that she had to clean up so completely understandable.

I've had shrimp tacos at numerous restaurants around the bay and must say these are way down on the list. The shrimp were cooked well but all other flavors in the taco were forgettable.

I was pretty surprised. We walked in on a wednesday night and couldnt believe how crowded it was. It's a big restaurant with some great features. A full bar and a bunch of TVs to watch the game. I guess this is a chain but, in my humble opinion, I think it's definitely a step up from a typical Chiles or Applebees. Maybe on par with a cheesecake factory or something to that affect.  At any rate, the atmosphere was casual but nice. They have a good selection of domestic and import beers as well as their own house brews. I tried the piranha pale ale and the hopstorm IPA. Both were pretty good. For dinner, I had the jalapeño burger with wedge fries. A generous portion but not overwhelming. What topped it off though was our waitress.  Right off the bat, Courtney was extremely helpful. Everything from course selection to beer recommendations. She was on top of it. Since we were new to the area, we figured we would ask about some other good places to eat and go out. She was a wealth of information on the local eateries and bar scenes. We got way more than we bargained for. Not only was the food and beer great, but the service and atmosphere was outstanding.

37,Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",437,436,1512.0,4.0,2014-09-01,"I have been a regular at BJ's for years now. We often find ourselves here because they are open late and way better than the other options in this plaza. I think part of the reason why I have not reviewed them yet despite my dozens(+) of times dining here is because the service and the food was really mixed in the beginning of our relationship. Now that BJ's and myself are old friends, I know where to sit, how to order and what to do if my order is bad. So, this review is going to be tip filled.  -Sit in the bar area if possible. The costumer service is SO much better in the bar area than in the dining room from my experience. You seat yourselves at whichever table you want and you are right in front of numerous TV's. Win-Win.  -If you are a beer snob (like me), skip their beer or order a known brand on tap. Yes, they are technically a brewhouse. However, they are more of a restaurant. The beer is okay, but not worth ordering in my snobby opinion. Note: If you are a Bud Light or Corona or {insert common beer brand} fan...order away.  -If your food is bad, ask for it to be remade or taken off your bill. Most of their food is good. However, I have had food come out wrong, be burnt or just awful. Recently I tried a new starter salad. It was supposed to have spinach, tomatoes, bleu cheese, bacon, hard boiled egg and vinaigrette. What I received was spinach and bleu cheese with almost no dressing. I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. I asked to have it removed from my receipt and they did. The rest of my meal was fantastic.  -Join the BJ's Rewards program:    It is free to join and you earn points towards gift cards/coupons/etc. to use on future visits. You will also be emailed coupons for free appetizers, Pizookies, etc.  -Save room for a Pizookie. A Pizookie is basically one of the best cookies that you will ever have in your life baked just for you to order. Then, it is topped with ice cream. Soooo good. Tip: You can order a half and half Pizookie and get two different flavors!  Other tips: -You can ORDER ONLINE for dine-in, pick-up inside or pick-up curbside -They have light options on their menu and they are good about substituting or excluding items if you prefer it. You can definitely eat here on a diet if you have the willpower to avoid the Pizookie. :)  Follow my tips and you are sure to have a pleasant dining experience at BJ's. Some of my favorite dishes on the menu are the BJ's Brewhouse Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Cheese, BJ's Cobb Salad, Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad, Southern Fried Chicken, Fresh Atlantic Salmon, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Tuscan Chicken Limone and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos.

I ordered a Long Island iced tea and it was so sour and acidic it made my face pucker.  I hardly ever send things back but at $9.50, I want to at least be able to get my drink down without gagging!  My sour puss expression was soon joined by a look of confusion when the bartender's second attempt returned nearly identical to the first. At this point my thinking turned to, ""If they don't get it by now, they aren't going to get it the third time"".   Onto another pet peeve.....dirty bathrooms.  Specifically toilet paper all over the floors and establishments that choose stainless steel fixtures and stalls and never clean them properly. The appearance of the bathroom stalls were so smeared and covered in splash marks it made me opt for the classic squat and try not to touch anything method.

105,B K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",3,38,18.0,4.0,2014-11-22,"Been to this BJs many many times and I've only had one bad experience and that was only because the bartender didn't have a clue how to tend bar.  I've sat at the bar, in the bar area and dining room.  I really haven't found that sitting in one area is better than any another area.  Though you can sit yourself at the tables by the bar, but most people know this, so on busy nights people are scouting them out pretty aggressively. I believe BJs has the best blue cheese dressing ever made, pair it with a wedge salad and save some to dip your pizza in and you'll be a happy person.  Their clam chowder is really good served in a sour dough bowl, and their avocado egg rolls are really good, but not a big fan of the sweet syrup they serve with it, so get some blue cheese dressing.  The Root Beer is brewed in house and is served in a frosty mug, pretty good stuff, but you only get one refill.  All of their ""house beers"" are brewed off site, they're pretty good, but nothing to get to excited about. Not a big fan of their pasta dishes, they aren't bad, but are kind of bland.  The meatloaf is pretty good too, but if you get the meatloaf try to order it on a busy night, or you might get a dry piece leftover from the night before.  For lunch the French dip and wedge salad has never disappointed. The deep dish pizzas are really good, we order them to go a lot, and have found that turning on the oven to 325 before we leave to pick it up helps a lot.  When we get home we throw the pizza in the oven for 10-15 minutes and it's nice and hot.  Also I have found that when ordering something to go, always add 10 minutes to the time they say it will be ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=100,3.68,3.61,3.61,3.152,3.6380000000000003

I had the California Chicken Club, which was okay; but the avocado and Swiss cheese saved it. The avocado was a great addition to the club, and gave it flavor and texture. The bacon was rock hard, and the chicken was a little tough and dry.  Morgan had the BJ Brewhouse Burger, which she didn't like.

We recently relocated to Tampa from a Fort Lauderdale suburb, and had given up on the BJ's Brewhouse in Pembroke Pines after plenty of chances. Bad food and absolute uncaring staff and management were the norm, so they were off the list. My wife, daughter and I dined at this location after a Rays game, and it was a very good choice. We really liked the texture, taste and presentation of our Chicken Lettuce Wraps appetizer, served with fresh ingredients and prepared with care. My daughter ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and my wife had the Southern Fried Chicken. Both smelled great, looked very appetizing and were very much enjoyed. Nice portions and well prepared. I had the BJ's Favorite version of their deep-dish pizza. It was loaded with chunks of Italian sausage, meatballs, pepperoni and veggies. The crust was still crisp, instead of soggy like so many competitors. It tasted great, was prepared very nicely and was very filling. I'd order it again without question.  Our Server, Danielle, made the night. She was very attentive, ensured we always had what we needed and were satisfied, and she was so personable and professional. Very, very nice job.

Though, I've been here quite a few times, this visit was for a drink and desserts. So, I tried their seasonal (think it was a pumpkin ale) - very good. Though, I usually just stick with their wheat beer. For dessert, we had their trio and WOW! It was delicious and just a perfect amount for two people.

I've also had the chert glazed salmon and I can't remember if it's quinoa or couscous. But that is my fav item on the menu. They have delicious flat breads also. But the salad I ordered wasn't what I expected. I had the Santa Fe Salad. It's pretty much the same that Applebee's has only they have corn & avocado in theirs. The dressing is a Santa Fe ranch and it's good. But, I was iffy on the chicken. Nothing wrong with the way it was cooked or anything.....I'm going to sound weird, but the way it was cut I suppose it looked odd shaped. If it had been cut into strips I think it'd be better. I ate about half the salad and still didn't satisfy my hunger. I'm not one to send food back, unless it's steak and it's over cooked. This review is based on this dish. I know they do have other amazing food on their menu. However I will say this, the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts is a new fav! Grilled and blacked a bit seasoned with creamy Sriracha sauce.

141,Laura W.,"Orlando, FL",21,122,,3.0,2016-02-13,"I can recommend BJ's for families or friends to visit together. There is a huge menu with options that will allow everyone to find something. The inside is nice-looking.  Now to the food. I ordered the portobello mushroom hot sandwich with thin fries. You can get it with or without a meat patty (strangely, the price is the same either way). The mushroom burger was very good, and included a grilled bun, swiss cheese, pesto, and a sauce similar to mayo. My friend got the pepperoni flatbread pizza, which was a thin crust with lots of pepperoni. We both ate/enjoyed all of our entries.  We also tried the BJ's-made beers. My friend ordered a flight of 4 different beers and I ordered a German-style beer. I have to say that the beer I tried was watery and not one I could recommend. My friend was ok with her flight of beers, but again no superlatives. While BJ's makes their own beers and is very proud of their offerings, I may order a different brand next time I go to BJ's. For $5.99 a pint (which seems high for a non-speciality brand), I can do much better with a national/international brand. There were no beer specials mentioned by the server. As information, my beer and sandwich came to around $20 with tax. The service was okay. Our waitress must have been taking a break or been called away, as someone else delivered the food and a supervisory employee checked on us to see if the food was okay. We were more than ready for the bill by the time we saw our waitress again. No refills on water or questions about how we liked our beers. Perhaps the table should have been handed over to a different server while the waitress was away? My recommendation would be to mark the menu for speciality diets - gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, etc. I have been to this BJ's twice before or after a movie at the nearby theatre. There is plenty of easy parking nearby and something for everyone. I think it and Chipotle's are the best food options in this Pinellas Park shopping center.

We had a pasta dish, which was very generous in terms of portion size. My fiance also had a steak, which was a nice cut (we have had the T-bone before, which is a little too fatty for our tastes and we wouldn't recommend it). However, the server Madelyn is by far the BEST server I have ever had at ANY BJ's locations -- or any restaurant ever, really! She is very attentive and anticipates the customer's needs. Every question we had was answered and we never had to ask or wait for a drink to be refilled. She was genuinely kind and seemed almost as if she had been a friends with us for years. The experience and professionalism that she displays is OUTSTANDING. 10/10 would recommend this young woman to anyone who eats at the Park Blvd BJ's. Ask for her if she is available and you will not be disappointed!

You can also put your name on the waitlist and order during busy times before you arrive to the restaurant.

The thing is, I'm not really cranky. I'm just here to offer some criticism. Very constructive criticism.  We were in the Christmas Parade and wanted to go with our group somewhere close. We aren't jerks so they called about four hours in advance to notify BJ's that there would be 20 people coming. Four hours is enough time to have tables ready and staff accordingly. I think.  The first thing that didn't sit right is when we respectfully asked for another table to be moved over so we could have more room. The rude server was obviously bothered by that and declined us since he had another party coming. Half of our party had to sit in a booth beside the table while five tables in the middle went untouched. A large party did come, but there were other tables that could have been moved, and we didn't need his snooty attitude.  The second issue is that ordering went horribly. There was zero organization, and two kids didn't get their food. By all means, make an adult wait for their meal, but cater to the couple of kids who tagged along. I mean sure, they were teens, but still. Always cater to the kids.  Third: it took FOREVER to get our food, but the four top beside us had already finished eating, but they were part of our 20 person reservation.  All in all it wasn't a great experience.

I haven't changed my mind about the food and the overall restaurant , but- I ordered in last week and it was a horrible experience. Maybe a one time thing, maybe there were some in-training setting up the dishes, but I will never ever order in from BJs. I don't say you shouldn't- but good luck to you.  They forgot 2 dishes (the kids' ones, which is the worst thing they could do...) and someone came over special to bring them- I appreciated that very much.  The rest of the food was less then eh. Salads were measly, potato was hardly cooked, they forgot dips, salsa, the sharing appetizers looked like they were forgotten in the tray for at least one day... ugh. Just real bad experience. Not to mention it was my kids' birthday and I had my in laws over for a ""nice"" dinner :-/ So in short- definitely would still go inside the restaurant, but would never ever again order take out. Oh and they sent me $25 e-card. Sorry, was not enough to compensate for this... :-( maybe if they covered the whole $76.51 bill... I just couldn't believe I paid that much for what I got!!

5,Ralph L.,"Orlando, FL",89,73,47.0,5.0,2017-07-12,"MENU: 5 stars. BJ's has just about anything you can ever ask for, but it's a chain, so in theory won't most chains also have everything you could ask for? Maybe, but BJ just seems to have more of everything and do it better too. Case in point: their ribs are stunningly delectable and one of the very best I've ever eaten. Their ribeye steak also is phenomenal; their pork chop is second to none. I've had those things everywhere else, but I can tell you BJ's does them the best. Basically, you can't go wrong with a single menu option (outside of their pizza, which most people love, but not this guy). Prices are okay, they can teeter on the expensive side for some things, but their promotions more than make up for this. MOOD: 5 stars. I like BJ's ambiance. It's part brewery, part sports grill, and all class. The restaurant is well-groomed and displays some bits of the upscale. You can take a date there -- bowtie, martini, and all. Or you can simply relax at the bar area in jeans and sneakers to watch your favorite team get pounded. The point is, either way, BJ's has something for every occasion. LOCATION: 5 stars. The location is ideal, situated in the heart of Park Plaza. You can see the BJ's sign from different angles and the restaurant is difficult to miss. There is plenty of parking, which mixes and mingles in with Pollo Tropical parking, and if you really get desperate, Chipotle or PNC. STAFF: 5 stars. I've been here several times and I've never had a real problem with the staff. There are a coupe waitresses who have some RBF, but other than that, I've appreciated the service plenty. There have been times I have not enjoyed the food and I've sent it back, and they've accommodated me, no questions asked. The manager even came out once to see how he could improve my experience. If that's not fine service, I'm not sure what is. VERDICT: 5 stars for one of my new favorite restaurants and locations in Tampa Bay. This is a great fallback option anytime, and the versatile menu and tasty dishes make this a winner no matter what the day or mood you're in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.04,3.32,3.32,,3.2080000000000006

Always have great servers but when the music goes off and the TV game noise goes on (cause you can't understand a word being said anyway) were out of there. There's a vibe we go there for and we left today without eating and went somewhere else because of this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park?start=20,3.6,3.46,3.46,,3.5160000000000005
0,Lizzette A.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,16.0,4.0,2017-11-10,"We picked BJ's Brewhouse, Wesley Chapel, for our monthly luncheon.   The commute was easy from Tampa and took us less than 20 minutes to arrive.  The restaurant looks new and the outside and inside were clean.  We waited approximately 10 minutes to be seated fir a party of 9 @ 1230. Our waitress promptly introduced herself and took drink orders.  The menu is extensive and covers a wide range of foods from fried, grilled, blackened, baked and raw. There are salads, burgers, wings, pizza, wraps, steaks and everything in between.  The roasted cauliflower with turmeric sauce was awesome! They could serve the sauce as a soup...delicious!  The roasted beets and the brussel sprouts were equally as good, but watch the salt!!  The salads were over the top and worth coming back for!! The steak was a little fatty, but the Salmon was cooked to perfection!  We would definitely recommend this place to have lunch or dinner.  They have a full bar and a good selection of imported and domestic beers.  A fair price for a good meal!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.56,3.46,3.46,,3.5000000000000004
6,Brandy H.,"Gainesville, FL",153,19,12.0,5.0,2017-11-11,"Went today for lunch and our experience was awesome. Seated ourselves in the high tops in the bar area and we had a great lunch. Amber was our server, she was awesome. Not overly attentive but got us whatever we needed in perfect timing. she suggested the calamari and man it was so good. My boyfriend then got the ribeye with the white cheddar mash and broccoli and I got mahi tacos. His ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare with great seasoning and the mash potatoes are incredible. Broccoli was kinda weak but ehh it's broccoli. My tacos weren't as impressive. They were mediocre, I've deff had better fish tacos. We will be back to try more things off the huge menu!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.56,3.46,3.46,,3.5000000000000004
4,Herbert P.,"Tampa, FL",51,7,28.0,4.0,2017-11-11,I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and sante fe salad.  Both were good.  Neither was spectacular but they weren't disappointing either.  The atmosphere is very casual and the setting serves the needs of many patrons.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.68,3.45,3.45,,3.5420000000000003
11,Donna D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,11,,5.0,2017-11-20,"This is our ""go to"" place especially with company for a casual meal.  Great food especially the flat breads, tacos and pizza.  They also have a great bar that fixes awesome specialty drinks.  Fun place to eat, socialize and if interested watch sports on the dozen or so TV's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.68,3.46,3.46,,3.5480000000000005
10,Tonya W.,"Largo, FL",1,25,10.0,4.0,2017-11-29,Lani  was an excellent server. Very professional and courteous. BUT!!!! Jennifer came out with an attitude as raw as the bison burger which was sent back. Lani is the reason for 4 stars.  Go Lani!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.72,3.47,3.496,,3.5700000000000003
2,Bernice P.,"Tampa, FL",101,27,108.0,2.0,2017-11-30,"I had the peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp. Its a 500 calorie meal. I think its a great choice for someone dieting or adamantly watching their calories. I ordered it because the combination ingredients sounded interesting. The bowl was good. I wasn't wowed, but it wasnt bad either. The seasoned tomatoe chunks and shrimp gave the dish most of its flavor. The quinoa didnt have much if any seasoning at all. I also signed up for rewards to get the FREE pizookie (pan cookie) salted caramel. Now im an absolute sucker for baked goods, but i didnt even eat beyond 2 bites of the cookie. It was sort of unappetizing. If it wasnt free i would have sent it back. The atmosphere is casual dining, clean, and family style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.76,3.44,3.492,,3.568
13,Ben C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,24,5.0,3.0,2017-12-16,Food is good usually. The pizza on Monday's are often made wrong. It's a pizza special day so the quality is not there always. But when the pizza is actually made right it is delicious. The lemon thyme chicken is usually good but there are many times it has no flavor at all. I would say there is no consistency at all here. If there was it would be higher on my list of places I like. The car side is a nightmare to say the least. I'm always waiting and waiting and waiting. Overall it's pretty decent,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pinellas-park,3.72,3.43,3.492,,3.5460000000000003
3,Danielle V.,"Miami, FL",5,25,3.0,5.0,2018-01-04,"I had an amazing experience at BJs today thanks to my experienced server, Jen! She had multiple tables at lunchtime but juggled all of them like a pro and took her time with me, even though I was sitting alone! The menu at BJs is huge and it can be daunting. She provided thorough explanations for all of the different cuisines. Jen provided intuitive and delicious recommendations. I would recommend the tomato soup, margherita flatbread, and tomato mozzarella salad (best salad EVER).
