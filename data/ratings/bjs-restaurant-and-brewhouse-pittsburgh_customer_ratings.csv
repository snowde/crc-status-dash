65,Christopher A.,"Sewickley, PA",200,20,47.0,5.0,2015-06-09,"BJ's has been under construction for awhile and it finally opened the other day, and I'm so happy that it did. Right from the start, you can tell that BJ's is a legit place.  I thought it looked nice on the outside but once you walk into the foyer, you know that this place isn't messing around. Such a sophisticated yet casual environment. You can go for a casual lunch with friends or a classy dinner with some co-workers.  They have a huge bar area with a wall of liquor, planked by two massive televisions. Perfect for any sports go-er.  In general, it IS a brewhouse and they have an endless list of craft beers. They even have a ranking/rating system of the beers on the menu that tells you what each beer is well paired with.  I thought the Cheesecake Factory had the biggest and best menu... but I must say, BJ's is going to give it a run for its money. It took be awhile to figure out what exactly I wanted, which is a good thing. They literally have anything and everything: burgers, tacos, deep-dish pizza, fish, fried chicken, etc.  At first introduction, the staff was a little too up-front and personal with me but my waiters ended up being super nice and sociable. Very knowledgable about the menu and especially the beer! They even have a mobile app where you can pay right on the app, rather than with your server. The app also utilizes a point system that earns you rewards over time.  I recommend this restaurant 100%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=60,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004

Servers are new and eager but some kinks need to be worked out. Great positive attitudes though so, no doubt improvements will happen over time.  Beers and hard cider were great and large amount of selections on menu.  Calamari came with two dipping sauces that were tasty separately and together  Crusted chicken dinner was wonderful but side dish veggie of broccoli was skimpy on amount.  Tortilla soup is amazing - definitely get some just make sure you get a spoon with it lol.  They make a great presentation of pouring the soup into your bowl which contains tortilla strips and a few other things but forgot my spoon - not a big deal but it took three requests just to get a spoon and it was darn worth it with that soup!  Jambalaya is awesome and pretty spicy.  Will try this place again. Especially because my fiancé loved the craft beers.  Oh, I really liked the decorations of framed pics with a vintage vibe.

I got a Hawaiian deep dish pizza and a few of the BJ's beers. The pizza was okay, nothing to write home about. The BJ's beers were less than impressive. As a self-proclaimed beer snob, I was dissatisfied by the lack of hops in their session IPA and regular IPA.

64,Victoria D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",64,148,5.0,3.0,2015-07-10,"2.5 It hurts my heart to write this because I went here three days after its grand opening and everything was amazing.  The food was great. The service was honestly the best I can remember having at a restaurant.  I ordered their Asian salad and the chicken was cooked to perfection I came back on Monday of this week during lunchtime to meet my family for a quick meal.  My quick meal ended up taking over an hour and a half for a total order of: 2 unlimited soup and salad meals, the santa fe salad, and my brother got some type of chicken dish.  Aside from the fact that they have one group of people waiting on tables and another group running the food and that is clearly extremely confusing and only causes more issues than productivity, I think the entire process needs a review.  I think their way of trying to be efficient having people designated to sections & tasks in this huge place is more negative than it is positive. I won't get into details, but my parents' soups and salads were coming out in doubles without spoons, our waiter was nowhere to be found for a period of time, three different people brought out the orders.  It was just chaos.  My brother and mom had also been here on two separate previous times within a week and had the exact same issue with the confusion. They have really really great food here plus an extremely extensive menu, but if you are looking for somewhere to go on a date or somewhere to relax, I would give BJs a couple months to get everything sorted out and settled.  I know I will wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=60,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

159,Burghers And F.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,5,11.0,2.0,2015-07-12,"I have tried this location four times, with the most recent being Saturday July 11 at 10:30pm.  They seem to be making small steps to improve their service. During my last visit the table runners appeared to have learned the table numbers because all food and drink brought to the table was correct.  A few people have complained about the wait time. I have been there twice on Saturday evenings and each time I was told the wait would be 5 minutes and was seated before that time. My first visit was a Sunday afternoon and although I was seated promptly they got busy quickly, be prepared for a wait on Sunday afternoon.  After being seated the waitress was prompt to take drink orders. However, the orders needed to be repeated due to how loud the background music was. They had the Cardinals vs Pirates game on the televisions and someone was raising and lowering the volume based on which team was at bat. One area they need to improve on is kitchen communication. I have ordered their chicken potstickers twice, my first time and most recent visit. When the potstickers got to the table the chicken was cooked thoroughly, no pink, but was cold. The first time the potstickers came out then 2 minutes later my entree arrived, the most recent time my entree arrived before the appetizer. For this trip when my entree, New Orleans Jambalaya, arrived cold. I have had jambalaya in New Orleans and the dish I had at BJ's lacked the flavor and spice that would be in a jambalaya in New Orleans. The highlight for any trip to BJ's is their beverages. Their home made beers and soda's are tasty. The first time I was there my waiter said they are like the Cheesecake Factory. After having been to BJ's four times and the Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count I disagree with what my first waiter said. The food and service at BJ's is well below the level that one gets at the Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for a place to eat go the extra 3 miles down to the Cheesecake Factory. I won't be going back until September to give them time to improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=160,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

The pickles were amazing little crunchy pieces of heaven. I'm wondering if I could go in and just order a jar of pickles?  The root beer was probably the best soda I've ever had and who knew that something as simple as a chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream could make you feel like you just won dessert lottery?

Yesterday, I had customers in town and tried to go for lunch. We were seated immediately (as the restaurant was not full), and then were forgotten/ignored by the waiters for more than 20 minutes. Not even water or silverware was delivered. The wait staff seemed to deliberately avoid looking in our direction as they walked past.  We flagged down a bus boy who seemed rather surprised that we should ask for a waiter. After a further 5 minutes, we left, again without a server coming to our table. As we left, the server and manager tried to intercept us but my customers had already left. After two attempts to try BJs, I doubt that there will be a third.

They have some entrees of course but they aren't trying to do every single type of food out there.  The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini. The apps were great too, stuffed mushrooms and all the different fried ones were cooked very well. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  This disappointing thing about this location and why I took away two-stars is because they don't brew their own beer like all of their sister locations.  WTF - C'mon!  This is the whole reason I go to BJ's over competitors.  I won't go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=200,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.248,3.0000000000000004

We were given a 40 minute wait time estimate, so we planned our arrival time around that.  When we arrived, there was only about a dozen people waiting.  We were told, so sorry, but the app doesn't really work and we should have called instead.  But they would do their best to get us a table in about another 20 minutes.  We went shopping at Trader Joe's and then decided not to wait for BJ's and went elsewhere for dinner.  Wouldn't you know, we had finished our meals when we got the text from BJ's that our table was finally ready.  Needless to say, we have not been back.  After being open for 2 months, customer service should be improving, not going downhill.  You give a guest the expectation of being seated in 40 minutes and you can't deliver that in over an hour and a half?  Ha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.38,2.92

The menu presents very well, and I was intrigued by the variety of layered beer drinks they offered (aka a 'black and tan' but with several other combinations). I gave the bartender two shots at making what they called a 'Dark Side of the Moon' (their stout over a blue moon), but he poured way, way too fast and it came out a light brown mess.  My wife had to return her fish dish because it was clearly foul, and my 'deep dish' pizza was closer to neapolitan style than Uno's or Lou Malnati's No reason to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=160,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.408,2.68

The food was not good. The flat bread we ordered was okay. The entrees, ugh. I chose the Hawaiian Mahi Mani. It was a stir fry kind of dish. The fish was overcooked and I think there was an entire onion mixed in with the over-soyed rice. The rice was soggy. The hubby got the ""dinner"" sized portion of the southern fried chicken. It comes on a bed of corn. He got two small pieces of tough, stringy, over cooked pieces of dry chicken on a bed of overcooked corn. Not good. I feel like the menu is way too big.

12,Mac R.,"Chicago, IL",164,344,841.0,3.0,2015-08-16,"We've eaten here twice now and I've definitely formed an opinion. BJs is a chain restaurant with a decent concept of large beer selections (many their own house brews) & a huge menu with so many options that seem to be executed in a very average way. Not bad but nothing that would ever wow you. And like many chain restaurants you get inconsistencies in service from a very large staff.  Their Hopstorm IPA is pretty solid and at $3.50 a glass at lunchtime one day, we were pleased. Their lunchtime BBQ plate was very reasonably priced under $7 and plenty of food but the pulled pork slider & BBQ chicken breast were average tasting fare. I'd describe the pesto chicken sandwich I had today exactly in those same terms with the addition today of slow service to go with it.  We definitely had better service last time at the bar than at a table today. There seemed to be lots of servers running around & standing around but very few people getting food.  I've heard this place has been super busy with long wait times. Today it was nearly empty and we had a long wait - well over 30 minutes for lunch to arrive.

136,Wascally W.,"Sewickley, PA",6,46,8.0,2.0,2015-08-16,"YOU NEED TO READ SOCIAL MEDIA!!! I had high hopes for your new restaurant, but since it opened, it's ratings on Yelp have been going steadily downhill. You need to bring in a professional management team to turn this new opening around. We were told an hour wait at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night, and though I noticed a lot of open tables sitting for quite a while, we weren't seated until 7:30 after I went up and pointed out an open booth. I like the setup, I like the menu, and actually, I could like the food. The beer selection is top notch as is the layout. We ordered an app of fried calamari, and the order was out exactly when the waiter took the order in. And it was barely luke warm. We sent it back, since a $9.95 app of calamari of that size better be spot-on. It's replacement came out 30 MINUTES later. And it could definitely have been more crispy and less greasy. And nothing close to an apology from anyone. We had a table of 3, consisting of 2 burger orders and a salmon quinoa bowl. After our dinners were delivered 30 minutes after the appetizer was finished(!), no questions as to whether we needed anything else. Ketchup on the side? No offer. Sauce on the side that was ordered for the salmon  - no sign, and no one asking. Everyone was quite happy with the food - burgers, fries and salmon were all cooked perfectly. So the fault is NOT with the food. As we sat during our 3 hour and 15 minute experience, we noticed an awful lot of unoccupied tables and a continuing waiting crowd. That's lost revenue, especially after these people suffer bad service. I really think this is a reasonably easy fix, but you better get it done soon. Once a new restaurant gets a bad rap, it's very hard to overcome, especially with several new restaurants opening right in the same development. Since this is your first entry in the area, you may want to polish your local image. Oh, and parking is horrendous. Who thought up building 3 restaurants in a row with a Trader Joe's in the middle, with a small shared parking lot? Summary: decent menu, food good but could be way better, food delivery horrendous, table turnover and wait time estimate poor, wait staff inattentive, bar and draft selection above par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=120,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.536,2.68

The food is mediocre. The service is abysmal. My advice if you're determined to come here? Sit at the bar and don't get food. Just order beer. You have half a chance of actually enjoying it.  This time we got there 10 minutes after they opened for a pre-movie lunch. 35 minutes later all I had was a water, nearly empty. There were no more than 5-6 other people in there. There were at least 10 servers, 6 of whom yakked it up in one corner and didn't move the entire time we were there. Ok, maybe there was a meeting. If so, I hope it was about how crappy the service is and what they need to do to fix it. But I doubt it.  The food is just ok. The fries are so skinny it's like what's left over from the potato after the real restaurants take what they need. And they are not good. Burger was ok but I've had better at most bars.

I told her 2 and she said there would be a 15 minute wait and tried talking us into the bar area. I kindly declined and told her we would wait for a table. The hostess then shoved the number pad at us and demanded a phone number & name. Wow, was this woman rude. As a ""Host"" you're the first person your guest sees and should be greeting each person with a welcoming smile. Didn't happen for us. This particular host must of had a problem with us because she then said hello and smiled at every person from us on. Can you say petty? Be professional, this isn't high school. Our server was super weeded in her section and looked so confused the entire time we were there. Food runners ran our appetizer and salads on top of each other and when our food came shortly after our app & salad, the food runner did not clear the plates. Drop and go must be BJs thing. Our stuffed mushrooms were cold and my califronia chicken sandwich was burnt. I used to love BJs down south, but this experience has ruined my love for your restaurant. The thing is, your food is still good and consistent...but I will never come back because your staff is sub par and has affected my experience tremendously.

I watched too many movies where the cook spits on the food, since someone complained, and I am not taking the chance.

I didn't see the 2 for $25 on the menu, so you would have to ask the server if they are offering it when you go.  One thing I noticed that's different here from other BJs is that the servers do not ask about your interest in the pizookie until you're done w/ dinner.  I can understand that that's probably more with etiquette.  At other BJs, they ask you in the beginning so they can time the pizookie perfectly since it is made to order.  I hope this place keeps improving in service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.6640000000000006,2.56

111,Kerry M.,"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",23,13,,4.0,2015-10-13,"So, I have given Bj's 3 tries. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend and we shared a beer and a couple appetizers. It was the middle of a Saturday and we had no wait. The waitress was great! Food came out quickly as well as our beers. The pork fries on the app menu is delicious and the flatbread was just ok. I enjoyed my experience and encouraged friends to try it out as well. The second time I went was with 3 girlfriends and it was less than stellar. I ordered a flight of beer and was disappointed when knowing nothing about the house beers could match them up to the appropriate name better than her. It was awkward. That was the first time I tried the personal deep dish pizza and it was probably the most amazing thing ever. Our waitress for the table was nice and sort of attentive but the amount of other people that come to your table to bring drinks, salads, entrees, is unbelievable and weird. It makes it hard to ask for refills or even an extra napkin. So, after this time, I understood the complaints about slow food and service from friends.  The third time I went was with another couple. When we showed up, we knew there would be a wait since it was a Sunday night. The way they have the front set up is weird with 2 different stations. Even though I had already been there, I was unsure which station to go to. We put our name in and waited by the bar. After waiting for about half an hour, we asked if the booths in the bar area were seat yourself, they said yes! Why didn't anyone tell us this! So we sat at an empty booth and proceeded to have a pretty good time. I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which was delicious and my friend ordered a house made crème soda which she said was amazing. We all ordered different things, deep dish personal pizza, alfredo pasta, brisket burger, and another deep dish personal pizza. We all finished our meals and they were all very well made.  In conclusion, I will keep going  back because the food is so good, just knowing the service is VERY hit or miss and you should pace yourself on any drink because you are unsure when it will be filled again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.512,3.0000000000000004

I ate at the bar with friends.  Had a pizza and some apps and it was great.  Second time I went with my husband. I got a salad with shrimp and the shrimp were absolutely horrible. Tiny and tasted so fishy and old. Not the way shrimp should taste. Waitress took my plate, and pretended to not notice that all my shrimp were pushed to the side with my salad barely eaten.  The 3rd time my husband and I went with another couple, and their twin babies, who were 4 months old. Our waitress started out great. Really friendly. But then almost got too friendly where she felt comfortable enough to complain about working so long.  She put our appetizer order in, and the apps were good. About an hour later, my husband asked about our food. She said ""don't worry it is coming!"" After another 15 minutes, he asked again. She had a distraught look on her face all of a sudden, and said she'd be back. Then the manager said she forgot to put our order in !  Let me remind you the 2, 4-month old babies who were with us. About 20 minutes later we got our order. The waitress came to our table, did not apologize or even acknowledge anything was off. It was so unprofessional.  My husband and I went back a 4th time this past weekend and got the siracha cheese nachos for our appetizers and the cheese was cold, and was not spicy or tasty at all. He ordered a chicken salad and I ordered a pizza (cuz at this point I'm nervous to order anything else, to be honest!) and my pizza was so cold when it came out, and my husband (who isn't picky about his chicken) said the chicken was really rubbery and tasted old.

109,Jason F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",150,1178,154.0,2.0,2015-11-07,"I stopped by here last night, a Thursday, with four other guys for dinner.  We were planning on eating at 7 and one of our party arrived there at 6:45 and was told that there was a 50 minute wait.  That ended up being almost spot on as the text message came in at 7:30 telling us that our table was ready.  The inside of BJ's looks quite nice as it is large and fairly open.  On one side of the restaurant is a large well lit and well stocked bar while the rest of the restaurant is for seating.  They also have a large chalkboard menu for their beer selections, a large number of TVs and some random open garage doors as dividers. To start off the evening I went with a sampler of their beers and picked their Irish red, imperial stout, pale ale and IPA.  All of it tasted pretty good with my favorite of the bunch being the pale ale which had an interesting flavor to it.  After getting our drinks we all put in our entree orders and I went with the sriracha chicken macaroni and cheese.  In the meantime I pulled my silverware out of the napkin and put it on my lap.  The napkin was wet and would ultimately end up getting my jeans uncomfortably damp.  I didn't say anything at the time but at a later point it came up at our table and we found out that four of our five napkins were this way.  Our food ended up taking almost an hour to get to our table.  I chalked it up to the place being busy but whenever we looked around we discovered that no one in our section had food.  Whenever the food was finally delivered it was quite the disappointment as well.  The chicken in my macaroni and cheese was cold (thankfully precooked) while the rest of my dish was luke warm at best.  So I asked the table whose dish we had waited on as one of ours ought to have been hot.  Bizarrely everyone's food was pretty cold and even the deep dish pizza pan that they had carried out to our table with tongs was at room temperature.  My buddy next to me had the wings and took one bite before sending them back because they were cold.  Another friend ate half a shrimp taco before noticing a grey shrimp and stopping.  In the meantime I plowed through my luke warm pasta and cold chicken.  The flavor of the food actually wasn't that bad as i loved the cheese and sriracha with the chicken.  It would have been so much better if it was hot though as who likes cold Mac and cheese? My buddy who got the cold wings ended up calling the manager over and politely informed him of the issues and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen that night.  The manager informed us that they just got backed up and didn't really say too much else.  His whole visit to our table lasted around 45 seconds and he ended up comping every meal at the table which was nice.  So in the end, all that we ended up paying for was the beer and tip. The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here again in the future.  My friends strongly urged me to give it a 1 star review and I considered it.  While this was certainly one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I have had recently, at least no one that I know of got sick and there was the positive aspect of good beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=80,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.184,2.96

We ordered the potato skins, wings and 2 of the salads to share. The food was just o.k. Some of the potato skins were burnt and others seemed not cooked long enough.

I was excited to take some friends there after having a really good first experience, and we went back yesterday and couldn't have been more disappointed.  The menu is very large, which in theory isn't a bad thing as long as you can make all of the dishes well.  We ordered the avacado egg rolls and a mini pizza for appetizers.  One of us got chicken tacos and 3 of us ordered burgers done ""medium.""  Our appetizers came out a few mins AFTER our main courses.  The Medium burgers all came out WELL done.  Zero pink in the middle, char burnt on the outside.  It made for an extremely below average burger experience.  The avacado egg rolls has a brownish tint to them - which indicated that the avacado wasn't prepared freshly.  They were very average.  The pizza and chicken tacos were really good - and because of the mixup with our order the manager comped us our dessert.  We got a few pizookies which was the highlight of the night.   All in all really disappointed with the service.  Most of the knocks on this place are service related and it starts from the top down (management).  The servers were really polite and seemed to be doing the best they could.  Also don't waste your time ordering a burger here, opt for something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.2800000000000002,2.92

I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel that a review is necessary for BJ's. Never have I been so disappointed on multiple occasions by a restaurant, and I don't understand how they are still getting business. My 3 encounters are below:  1st visit: I and 2 friends went on a Saturday evening (around 9 o'clock, so the dinner rush was gone and we sat immediately). The waitress was initially nice, but when she found out that we were only ordering dessert she quickly lost her charm. She was rude and repeatedly gave us dirty looks throughout the night. Then when our food arrived, she returned with the check before we reached our 2nd bite.  2nd visit: Returned with a group of 8 for a birthday lunch. The drink orders were repeatedly wrong, the waiter had few manners when it came to reaching across the table and mixing up orders, and to top it off one of our guests was elbowed in the head by a passing staff member.  3rd visit: Five of us sat in the bar area to avoid the 2 hr wait to sit on a Monday night. The waitress (who I feel bad for) had to repeatedly apologize to us because she was the only staff member working the entire bar area. Meanwhile, there were 2 or 3 staff members just standing around by the kitchen door. It took a minimum of 15-20 minutes for her to make it back to our table. After the 20 minute wait to receive our drinks and get our orders in, we waited an hour for our food to come. We then had to request our checks when we ordered dessert because we had a movie to get to. When our checks finally came, they were all wrong. We also never had our waters refilled. And to top it off after the 2 hour ordeal we were late to get to the movie theater and it was sold out by that point. You'd think getting to a restaurant by 4:45 on a Monday would be plenty of time to make it to a 6:45 movie showing...clearly not.  I am very disappointed by this restaurant. They are now reaching the point where they can no longer use being a 'new' restaurant as an excuse. The service is horrendous and slow, and the food is mediocre at best.  The only reason I am giving them a 2 stars is because the beer is pretty good.

With 3 older kids at our table the waitress stood there and scanned every detail of each of our IDs (mind you, we are all in our 30s with children). After trying to order chips and dip for appetizer, the waitress returned, much later, to tell us they were out of them. After our appetizers came we had to flag the waitress down and ask her if we could order, at this point we had already been there an hour! She finally took our order and then returned 3 separate times to tell us that they were out of the things we had ordered! Refills were never offered or given and we had to ask for dirty plates to be removed. I ordered the slider burgers with fries. The burgers were thin chip-like burgers that were burnt. I asked the waitress if they were supposed to come with grilled onions like the menu said and she stated they were in the patty. I found ONE onion in one out of 4 burgers!

76,Joe D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",405,549,447.0,3.0,2016-01-05,"Another ""warehouse"" brewery with exposed pipes, air conditioning, and light fixtures. Time to retire that look, it's been done to death at the Rock Bottom, Dave & Buster's,  and hundred of other chains. Want to see a beautiful ceiling while drinking beer, head to the Church Brew Works.  BJ's is located in the new McCandlis Crossing off McKnight road. Another giant hodge podge of Ethan Allens, Super Cuts, Trader Joe's (this is Pennsylvania, no two Buck Chuck, TJ Brew or Trader Joe's Cafe) and other boring chain places that dot the western Pennsylvania landscape. BJ's is new to Pittsburgh, a brewery/restaurant/bar miss mash with their beer as the star of the show. Stopped in with a friend, had a double IPA, not bad, tasty, hoppy, floral in the front, hints of lime, grapefruity finish. 5.75 a pint, my friend loves stouts and enjoyed their version. We'd eaten before stopping in for a nightcap but did look the menu over. The large menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, lots of choices, lots of calories, a few lighter menu items caught my eye like the salmon over quinoa & vegetables, at 1050 calories, I didn't find that very light. Fish tacos, flatbread, deep dish pizza, and burgers make up the bulk of this menu.

161,Jill B.,"Wexford, PA",70,10,13.0,2.0,2016-04-03,"Unfortunately this place has gone down in quality over our visits in the past year. We visited this location a total of 4 times. If I rated this place after my first trip I would have easily given it 5 stars. On the first trip our service by Courtney was amazing, the beer selection was great (and still is), and the chicken dinner and pizza was really good. We enjoyed it so much we came back. Every trip we waited over an hour for a table for 3. The ""online check in"" never worked for us. It would say 45 minute wait and we'd arrive 45 mins later and still wait 45 more mins. This actually happened all 4 times. Our second trip my salad was forgotten. A person brought my daughter's salad and said mine would ""be right out"". Our dinners arrived and still no salad. Our pizza was served with very little toppings for the cost and we were disappointed. We decided it could have been a fluke so we returned for trip 3. This trip our server carried out the mug of root beer grasping it with her hand over the top of the mug instead of using the handle. When our pizza arrived it was served by another person and not our server. Our server came to our table and said she couldn't believe how lazy the staff was. She said the person who brought our food was supposed to serve us our first piece of pizza. I said I didn't care and it was ok but she continued to rant about her lazy co-workers. She said she would serve it to us (Which I insisted she didn't need to do). She proceeds to cut a piece with the utensil and actually lifted up the pizza with her bare hand and placed it on my plate. I was so grossed out by this that we asked for a box and took our remaining pizza home to eat..and obviously left the pizza she served with her bare hands behind. It took us 6 months to decide to give this place ONE more chance (stupid us, I know, but we kept hoping for a trip like our first visit). We returned as long as as we didn't get the same server that clearly had never attended a food handling training. Our final visit started by being seated at a dirty table. Then my husband got a salad with a giant hair (looked to be about 10 inches long) tangled all through it. He told the server and she lifted it up and said ""where, I don't see it?"" Then she goes ""oh wait, there it is! Wow that's really gross!"" .....umm yes it was. My chicken dinner was served on a plate with red crusty sauce stains and my chicken had white sauce in it so the crusty marks were due to using a dirty dish. At this point I was fed up and angry at myself for giving this place so many chances. The server didn't bring out my husband his ""hair free salad"" until our dinners were served, and the salad remained on our bill and a manager never came to talk to us. It was all very unfortunate because the place had a lot of potential with a prime location, excellent beer choices, and a gigantic menu. However, poor service and lack of cleanliness has caused this place to be on our never return list. The beer quality and quantity is the only reason I was willing to give this place a few stars.

176,Sophie G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,2016-04-10,"I tried this place last night and was seriously shocked at the lack of service I received. The high school girl taking names at the door could care less about her job and clearly would rather be anywhere else but there. It was a busy Saturday night and the girl told us the wait would be 45 min. We deiced to wait. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. From the start I thought this was a terrible idea. I also have an out of state number so from the start I was worried something would go wrong. As we sat and waited the high schooler told each party after us a different time. The people after us was an hour, a few more people later it was 90min and then it was 25min. Clearly she had no idea what she was doing.  Finally after about 40min I started to notice people being taken that had come in long after we did so I decided to inquire. The snotty high schooler gave such sass when I asked that I almost walked out right then and there (and trust me I should have!). Without looking up my name or  any sort of information she told me the people were being taken because they'd called ahead. That very well may be but she hadn't even looked my name up to make sure that was true. Clearly just an answer the management teaches the hostess to say. So I then inquired how long it would be until my name was called and she proceeded to tell me that actually my number had already been texted and I had missed my table. We had been sitting right in front of this girl the entire time with my phone in my hand and I had not missed a text. She then read me my number that I supposedly had given her and it was all sorts of wrong. Now I don't really blame the girl for messing up a phone number because it was busy and loud, and one that was out of state, but it was her attitude and her ""I don't give a crap"" tone that made it not okay. I started to get really angry because I was getting no where with this child who didn't know what she was doing. I proceed to ask how much longer it will be and she says ""it will be the next table"" so I ask again ""how long"" and she just kept giving a snarky response of ""it will be the next table"". Due to this girl's attitude I decided it was time to ask for the manager. I had to ask THREE TIMES before I got the manager. The first time the manager was not around, the second she, the hostess, blew me off and the third I realized he was standing, hiding behind some other hostesses because he saw what was going on and didn't want to deal. It took three tries to get the manager and even on the third try the girls working the hostess desk played telephone to tell him why I was mad and he finally, slowly made his way over to me. At this point I was pretty upset and told him what a crappy job the hostess was doing and how disappointed we were. THE MANAGER WALKED AWAY FROM ME. In the middle of my rant he just walks away and disappears. Now I was upset but I was in no way out of control or doing anything that would require him walking away. A simple apology and a table would have done the trick but he walked away. At this point another hostess takes us to our table and the manager is still out of sight. He finally comes over a few minutes later and said ""sorry I was making sure you got a free app"". Still never did I get an apology for the poor treatment from the idiot at the door or from him...I didn't even want a free app!!! After we sat down I tried to calm down but was still really shocked at how disrespected I had been. I was really hoping the food would make up for the lack of service but unfortunately it did not. The free appetizer we got wasn't bad (avocado spring rolls) but the pizza we ordered was TERRIBLE. We order a pizza with olives, onions, pepperoni, and sausage. The moment the pizza was put down on the table I looked at it funny, questioning if it was even throughly cooked. The second I took a bite I knew it was not. The pizza tasted uncooked and was cold. I wasn't about to complain after the lack of respect I had already received from the manager but the food was awful.  I would not recommend this place at all. I have been to the one in Columbus and it wasn't bad but this place is truly awful. Even the staff that I didn't have a run in with looked miserable. It's a shame this place is so terribly run and doesn't offer good food when it just opened.

Now that it's been open for a few months the crowds have died down especially with Burgatory opening next door. Anyway, this place has a large seating area with a bunch of televisions. They have homemade Root Beer, orange soda, cream soda, etc. The root beer is really good. As far as the food the pizza is very solid and the burgers aren't bad. My favorite though is the balsamic glazed chicken (pictured below). It comes with mixed greens, onion straws and mashed potatoes. You get two decent sized pieces of grilled chicken smothered with balsamic vinaigrette and covered with the onion staws. It's the perfect portion that will make you comfortable full but still have room for desert. I would recommend this dish. The desert are amazing.

Burgers were quite good. One was over cooked so only got an average review. The bacon cheeseburger was excellent. Shoestring fries are great if that's your thing.

""Just going to sit at the bar, thanks"".  8:31pm - sat at a pair of open seats at the 60% occupied bar. DIRECTLY in the middle. Easy enough.  8:32pm - bartender, who is a slightly younger than middle aged woman, passes by my area, and without stopping, turns her head to say ""make sure to get your IDs out"" Strange, I think, because even though I'm relatively young, my lady friend and I are both in our late 20's. Haven't been asked to order anything at this point, mind you. The tone of this premature ID request was a bit accusatory, prompting me to think, ""it's like a damn police state."" ""Do I need an ID if I was ordering soda?"" 8:40 pm - ""do you know what you want?""  ""Yes"" I reply. Lady friend orders, I order, ""piranha pale ale please"".  ""Have you had this before?"" ""Uh, yes?"" Strange question. She asks ""would you like to try it?"" ""No, I'll just order one"". 8:43pm- drinks arrive. ""May we also have a menu?"" ""Sure"". Menus are acquired. 9:00pm - (this is 15 minutes later) ready to order. Awkwardly opening my menu, closing my menu, placing my menu closer towards the bar, stacking both menus. Every common ""sign"" that a table is ready to order. Eye contact with bartender established, signs of hope, then hope is lost as I spend the next 10 minutes watching bartender pass back and forth, awkwardly avoiding eye contact. 9:10 - starting to get irritated. Aside from shouting at bartender vs. lighting myself on fire in protest, I can't seem to afford her attention. Getting too uncomfortable and awkward to order. We determine that unless we're acknowledged in 5 minutes, away we go. 9:20 - my 5 minutes turned to 10, I finally lean over the bar, and ask for the check. ""Sure"". Check arrives. I pay in exact change, leaving a $1 tips per drink. $2 in total extra on a $13.11 tab. We take our leave. 9:21 - I'm across the street, being seated at Burgatory, where I had a delightful experience before a 10:30 movie. I will be going to Burgatory from now on.

I probably shouldn't have ordered that at a place like this (I should just stick to chipotle for that stuff). My husband said the fish tacos were just average.

2,Tricia B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",53,202,264.0,3.0,2016-08-03,"Yelpers, you seem to have this one right on the money. Three stars is a pretty accurate rating for this middling restaurant. We came here with some friends the other night. In general, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I try to keep an open mind. Chain or not, if a restaurant has good food and service, I'm game.  Unfortunately, BJ's Brewhouse doesn't excel in either food or service. On the Saturday night we were there, it was quite busy, and apparently is usually that way. With so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, I can't quite understand why, but some mysteries of the universe don't have a good answer. We grabbed drinks and an appetizer at the bar while we waited for our table. Our appetizer, the chips with sriracha queso dip, arrived quickly, but it was lukewarm. Lukewarm food is always a punishable crime, but it gets elevated from misdemeanor to felony any time cheese is involved. Because it wasn't hot enough, the queso was thick and semi-coagulated...quite unappealing. Also, despite its name, there was no sriracha flavor in the queso at all (which was so disappointing, as I love me some sriracha).  Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to refresh our bar drinks and take our order. And unfortunately, it was this way throughout most of our meal...our server was largely absent, and we had to repeatedly flag him down when we needed something. As for our food, we all ordered different things, with mixed results. One friend ordered fried artichokes, tomato soup, and a mozzarella and tomato salad. She reported that the soup and salad were good....fairly standard (as she pointed out, it's pretty hard to mess up tomato soup and mozzarella salad). The fried artichokes, however, were disappointing in that they didn't have any discernible artichoke in them....she said they pretty much just tasted like fried breading. Another friend got the spinach-stuffed mushrooms and thought they were tasty. My husband got the California Chicken Club, which came with a mountain of fries. He thought the sandwich was way too greasy. The bread was very heavily buttered, which made this light-sounding sandwich much heavier than it needed to be. I tried a few of his fries and they were decent....very thin cut and crispy. As for me, I opted for boneless wings with Peppered BBQ sauce. The portion of wings was HUGE....I clearly failed to notice the menu description stated that it was a pound of wings. Uh, whoops. A pound of fried anything for dinner is never well-advised. So needless to say, a doggie bag was needed. The wings themselves were crispy and meaty (thumbs up), but unfortunately there was barely any sauce on them (thumbs down). I wanted to ask for more sauce, but couldn't find our server. So most of the wings I ate were dry and largely devoid of flavor. Total bummer! As for drinks and dessert....my one friend ordered a watermelon basil margarita and found it to be sweet to the point of being undrinkable. To our server's credit, once we flagged him down and told him that she wanted a beer instead, he took the drink back and didn't charge her for it, so that was good. My husband ordered a couple of their porters and thought they were okay, but was expecting more from a place that brews its own beer. For dessert, we of course had to try their famous pizookie, which is a freshly-baked cookie with ice cream on top. We shared the pizzokie trio so we could try several flavors (we chose salted caramel, cookies and cream, and peanut butter). My friends went nuts over the pizookies and thought they were insanely delicious. Personally, while I thought they were good (I mean, you almost have to actively *try* to make anything with cookies and ice cream taste bad, right?), I thought in general they were a bit too sweet and the individual flavors of each pizookie were drowned out in the overload of sugar. So all three mostly ended up just tasting like generic cookie with generic ice cream to me. Also, the edges of the cookies were overcooked to the point where it created a very unpleasant tough texture in those spots. I dunno...I guess I fancy myself a bit of a dessert snob, so when something is hyped up to the extent the famous pizookie is, I expect it to deliver. This was just so-so for me (but again, my friends loved it, so different strokes). The above rambling dissertation essentially boils down to the fact that BJ's is quite average across the board. While it's not terrible, it's not a place that I will seek out, and it's certainly not worth waiting for on a busy Saturday night. Go elsewhere, my hungry friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=20,2.44,2.75,2.75,2.284,2.6260000000000003

33,Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",355,771,3128.0,2.0,2016-09-05,I must admit that this is the 2nd BJs I have visited and I was a bit disappointed to learn that they are not alike. They APPEAR alike because this restaurant is an exact copy of the one I previously reviewed at South Hills Village. We had a 15 minute wait to be seated. I have the app but wasn't sure when the rest of our party would arrive so I did not reserve ahead of time. When you have to wait you give them your name and cell number so they can text you when they have a booth waiting for you. The menu and beers are identical to the South Hills one. I showed my waiter my rewards number on my phone so he took note of it. When you spend so much on a tier then you get a small reward. My son and daughter decided to split a large deep dish pizza since on Mondays pizza is half off. I went with my lunch portion of the thyme chicken I had before.  I sampled their pizza and it was very rich and quite filling. When I started my meal again I found it was not heated up. So I asked my waiter to heat it up which he did. Later I found the ice had melted in my tea so I had to wait a while to get a cup of ice to cool it down. The food is the same and was just enough for me. We decided to order the pizookies for dessert. This time I got the chocolate chunk mini and my kids got the chocolate cookie covered with ice cream for the dessert. As always they were very good. The waiter brought my check early and then when he added in the desserts I later found out that I was not awarded my points for this visit. I found that out after we left so I called over there and spoke to a manager. He told me he would credit the points to my account but it would take a few days. Normally when I ate at the one in the South Hills I would get an email immediately . He told me this wasn't the case. This BJs sits in a strip mall which is part of McCandless crossing. I also learned during this visit that they are planning on building a third location out in Robinson. My guess would be Settler's Ridge but time will tell if it will go there or among the restaurants near the mall of Robinson. They also plan to build one in Cranberry as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,2.4,2.73,2.73,2.216,2.598

19,Randy M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",10,6,,3.0,2016-09-11,"BJ's has been around for a while, and I've always wanted to go.  I don't eat at chain restaurants often, but every once in a while I do.  Their specialty is pizza and beer, and I was expecting a lot from BJ's and came away not impressed, but it wasn't awful. The good: The fried portabella fritters were awesome.  They were crunchy with a lot of breading, but there was a lot of portabella in each fritter.  Dip it in ranch dressing and it's a match made in heaven.   The pizza crust was excellent.  It was a deep dish pizza  and the crust was light, fluffy, and buttery. The bad: I got the BJ's Classic Combo pizza, which contained mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni.  The sausage was okay, but could have been better and lacked flavor(needed more fennel).  The mozzarella was actually pretty good.  What killed the pizza for me was the pepperoni.  The pepperoni looked like it came from the supermarket and was not high quality to me.  If I'm going to pay 15 bucks for a small pizza, I want to have quality ingredients all around.   Overall, the food was okay.  They need to get better pepperoni.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=20,2.36,2.7,2.7,2.412,2.564

The interior is fun and the lighting of the bottles on the bar created a really cool atmosphere. I ordered the Mini One Topping Pizza with a side salad.  It was only $7.50 which I thought was an awesome lunch time deal.  I wasn't really thrilled, though.  It's a deep dish pizza, which is fine, but it just felt so...messy.  I ate it with a fork and knife because that was the only option, but even then I didn't feel like I could enjoy it.  I didn't know anything about BJ's prior to the day of, but as a chain restaurant it definitely has that chain restaurant food taste.  So I wouldn't expect much more than that. We also all commented on the loud echo in the restaurant.  There weren't many people there, but everything reverberated. I don't drink but there was a massive board with a list of beers.  If you're a beer drinker, this really wouldn't be a bad place to go to sit and hang with friends over a couple of beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=20,2.36,2.72,2.72,2.38,2.576

155,Bryan M.,"Mars, PA",0,6,7.0,3.0,2016-10-22,"Added our name to the Waitlist via the BJ's app on Friday at 5:15pm. It initially said there was a 15 minute wait for parties of our size (3) which was perfect because that is how long it takes us to get there. We arrive and check-in. The Wait Time on the app now says 35 minutes which we expect to be no problem as we don't mind waiting a few minutes until 5:50pm for our table to be ready. The App also mentions that ""This is not a reservation, so you may experience a slight wait when you arrive."" As it approaches 6pm and we hear other parties with similar sized groups being called to be seated we start to wonder if the Wait List has even helped our place in line. This location is rather new and there always seems to be a crowd in the lobby - which is totally normal and expected. On this visit, though, they actually served small slices of pizza to the guests waiting for their tables. We thought this was a great! (I always thought a restaurant should have a separate sidebar and waiting room with light snacks to make the wait a little more bearable.) Anyways, we are seated at 6:05pm and order our drinks. We tried to order their newly advertised Pumpkin beer and our waitress tells us that they sold out in 6 days and it's no longer available (it's not even November!). We decide to order an appetizer - Sriracha Queso with Chips. Our family is no stranger to queso and this is our 2nd time ordering it at BJ's. We are always surprised how it seems to lack the Sriracha part. For dinner, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with fries. My wife, K, ordered the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles which was a new addition to the menu. Our son, G, ordered the BBQ Boneless wings - and the waitress suggested he try their Root Beer BBQ sauce on the side. We had a longer wait for our food than normal. Both adjacent tables who were seated after us received their meals before us - but there was no worry because our server brought us extra chips! Once the meals were delivered, I now understand why it took so long...they had to wait for my wife's dish to be delivered from Noodles & Company in Cranberry! The noodles and the portion size was much smaller than pictured. There was really no spicy component to it - it tasted more like an orange flavored sauce. My sandwich was delicious - lightly toasted and a healthy serving of avocado. G's Boneless Wings were plentiful - there had to be at least 15 on his plate! Overall, an OK experience that's why I gave it 3 stars. We still enjoy BJ's and their expansive menu - and especially the beer! The Jeremiah Red is my favorite! In the end, $50 for 3 is absolutely fair. We will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=160,2.4,2.73,2.73,2.476,2.598

We have one favorite dish on the menu that is hard to pass up.  It's the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp and it is so delicious.  It features black olive pieces, tomatoes, and pearl cous cous in the most delightful broth featuring an anise licorice flavor.  The fish is moist and meaty in texture and flakes easily.  It is just the right amount to fill you up but leave enough room for one of their delicious peanut butter and jelly pizookies.   This last visit we tried something new: golden asparagus with lemon aioli sauce.  It was good and fried.  I mean, who doesn't like fried, right?  This is a tempura-like batter that was a little thick in certain spots but very tasty.

For food, we ordered a couple small items- the fried portabella strips appetizer, the Brussels sprouts appetizer and a small Hawaiian pizza with habanero added (the bartenders recommendation). Everything was great- the portabella strips were juicy and the sauce that came with them were so complimenting. The Brussels sprouts were just as good, although I would have preferred if the sauce came on the side, rather than them swimming in the sauce. Regardless, the sauce was REALLY tasty. The pizza was super delicious, although I didn't really notice a spicy kick at all from the habanero. Just when I thought we were done eating, my friend ordered the ahi tuna appetizer.

116,Nichole A.,"Mars, PA",128,1,,1.0,2017-02-26,"I really want to know how this restaurant functions on a night that it's actually busy. Came here for my birthday tonight. My sister in law tried calling ahead to make a reservation as it was going to be 8 adults and a baby. She was told that we couldn't get a reservation because our party was larger than 6 people (first red flag). However, she was assured that they are NEVER busy on Sunday nights and that we should have no problem being sat right away. Okay then- we decide to go. Get there just before 6 pm. There's a decent amount of customers in the restaurant, but nothing crazy. We go to the hostess stand and are told, ""Oh, well since we have to push two tables together, it's going to be a 45 minute wait."" We were hesitant, but then looked at how many tables were open + how many people were leaving the restaurant and figured it wasn't going to even take 45 minutes (and probably wouldn't have anywhere else), so we put our names in and wait. And wait. And wait some more. Meanwhile, all these small parties of people walk in and are getting sat right away. During this time not once did either of the hostesses come to check in on us or say they were working to get a table together for us asap- just nothing. Finally, after an hour of waiting my other sister in law, husband, and their baby (my niece) have to leave because the baby is getting restless. THE WHOLE POINT OF US GOING WAS TO BE TOGETHER FOR OUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. So we go back to the hostess stand to let them know that our party is now going to be just a table of six. As we walk up to the hostess stand, the hostess literally looks over my fiancée's head to ignore him and sit another party that had literally just walked into the restaurant. I'm ready to leave and just go to Panera at this point, but we decide to stay. I wish I could say it got better from that point on, but sadly it did not. We were sitting for about 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Then as we're getting our drink order, my future father in law tries to order a beer, but our waiter interrupts him to tell him that the beer he wants is very similar to another beer and that he'll get him a taste of both (ummmmm okay?). So he goes back and gets our drinks. My future in law tastes both beers and orders the beer he originally tried to order to begin with. At this point we don't know how much longer we'll have to wait until the next time we'll see him, so we figure we need to order our food as quickly as possible. I we order appetizers. And wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, we get plates, only to realize that we weren't given enough plates. Oh, and at this point we don't have silverware or the beer my future father in law order. So we say something, finally get the amount of plates we need and the silverware. Still waiting on the beer. The beer finally arrives, but it's the wrong beer. Luckily, that gets fixed fairly quickly (and by fairly quickly, I mean we only wait 5-20 minutes before the correct beer is brought out). Finally, after being in the restaurant for almost 2 hours, our appetizer arrive. I wish I could say they were terrible, but they were pretty good. We had the chicken pot stickers and lettuce wraps. Then we got our food- oh, except for me because they messed up on it and our server surprisingly caught it and had it fixed. We finish our meals and then then bill came. We see that nothing was comped even though we had expressed our grievances throughout the dinner. At this point, I'm ready to scream, but miraculously hold it in. My future father in law says something to our server, who responds with ""oh, was it anything I did?"" Weird. But, we did end up getting some of our meal comped. The manager never came out to apologize or check in on us what-so-ever, so it's clear as to where the problems stem from. So, that was mine and my fiancée's birthday dinner...... The only reason that this is getting one star is because the food is good. Horrible service and there is clearly a management problem, but decent food.

Waiter serving us was very low energy and just didn't seem to want to be there. The waiter serving the table next to us was running circles around ours, and smiled. The food was salty, salty, salty (beef sliders and the turkey dip) The draft beer menu is impressive. I ordered the Nutty Brewnette which was really good. Once we gave our main course order, I ordered a ""flight"" of beers. I literally asked for the flight to be sent along with main course 15 seconds after ordering. This seemed to annoy the waiter who said ""it's already been sent, I'll let them know."" This was an odd claim because the waiter hadn't left our table yet and we were very close to the bar. On our second visit, the service was great. Our waitress was on point, energetic and welcoming. Unfortunately the food was salty again. I ordered beef sliders which tasted good, but one of them was literally the size of a quarter, like as if they ran out of beef. We also ordered the boneless wings which were terrible. The level of salt was truly unlike anything I've ever experienced. I drank plenty of water and could not finish even though I was hungry. If they could step up the food quality a bit and show some enthusiasm and knowledge of the craft beer menu, I'd be happy to give them another try. Sadly, I don't think we will be back a third time.

17,Bob L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,17,,1.0,2017-07-28,"I am an HR professional working at the headquarters of a national company located about a mile away from this restaurant. Part of my job requires me to cater lunches for visitors to our office which can be a challenge in the North Hills. On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, I decided to give BJ's a try for a take out lunch for seven. As is my preferred practice for these events, I placed the order online, but was surprised that no payment was requested. A few moments later, I received an order confirmation email with an online payment link. Upon clicking the link, an error message pops up that online payments are not accepted via the link until 15 minutes before order is ready. I waited until 15 minutes prior and entered my payment into system. I then received online confirmation of my payment and requested an email receipt which was received shortly thereafter. Upon arrival at the restaurant, the server putting my order together claims no payment was showing. I advised that I paid online. The server goes into the back and brings out Junior Joe Manager who restates the same. I advised him that I paid online and will not pay twice. Junior Joe states no payment received so I tell him to have a nice lunch, turn and begin to leave. Junior Joe states that if I leave he will call police because I ordered food and did not pay for it. I advise again that I paid online and I will not pay twice. Junior Joe states he will not tolerate my aggressive behavior and I must leave. I gladly left without food never to return again. Upon arrival back at the office, I called BJ's corporate office in California and explained situation. Tiffany stated she would investigate, make sure payment is credited and call back. No call, email, fax, telegram or carrier pigeon has been received. As someone who understands the challenges of having employees with diverse skillsets, I normally would recommend a thorough program of retraining for Junior Joe. However, given the serious nature of this incident threatening legal action against a customer, termination is absolutely justified. In addition, I strongly recommend staying away from online payments at this place because clearly they have issues which border on a scam that they are unwilling to address with their payment processor. Personally, I will just stay away from BJ's altogether and continue to purchase from competent restaurants that appreciate my company's business. The ""F"" rating BJ's has earned with the Better Business Bureau is very well-deserved in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh?start=20,3.4,2.83,2.83,,3.058

Both were VERY tasty.  The Chicken was tender and flavorful.  The Prime Rib was equally tender, well seasoned and excellent cut with little fat.  Saving room for dessert, we got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie...fancy word for a large baked cookie, topped with chocolate ice cream.  It was also very good and we like the dessert.

I think it's weird that a large portion of the menu is for lunch hours only. There are more vegetarian options for lunch than for dinner. They have a space on their menu that says, ""We have LOTS of vegetarian options, ask your waiter what meals can be made into vegetarian options"". I wish that they had a leaf marker on Vegetarian/Vegan options like most other places do to make it easier for the customer. Food quality isn't too notch, but it is what you'd expect from a chain restaraunt. Nothing great, nothing terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,3.28,2.83,2.83,,3.01
26,Sammi A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",58,29,44.0,5.0,2017-11-21,Came in here for lunch. I had the flat bread and soup. It was really good. Took awhile to get our food but other than that everything was good. Decided to get dessert and holy moly!!! This was crazy good. Be sure to get a dessert if you go!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,3.28,2.85,2.85,,3.0220000000000002
25,Rosa A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",44,31,23.0,5.0,2017-12-04,"I'm not sure how I've never reviewed BJ's because pizza is one of my favorite things, and I love going there! I've been to this BJs and also the one at South Hills Village many times. Only once did I order something other than pizza (I believe it was tacos!). My boyfriend and I loveeee the pizza. I usually get a small (for myself) because I like to take a few pieces for leftovers! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, my boyfriend's is the classic combo. The chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken are also good contenders. Tonight I tried the Great White, which had Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. So good!! We've always had really friendly service at both locations and the beer they have on tap is pretty excellent too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,3.36,2.87,2.87,,3.066

29,Harold P.,"Murrysville, PA",0,4,,2.0,2017-12-10,"My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch Saturday, December 9 , 2017. We were able to get a table easily. The restaurant has a pleasant contemporay vibe. The decor is modern-bland, but totally acceptable.  We looked at the beer menu, and found it to be overpriced with 16oz setting you back +$6. Beer from other breweries were similarly priced. So, they have elected to overcharge for their own brews, favoring high profit margin over promoting their own brand. Compare this to 16oz at my local Rivertowne brewery for $3.50. Wine prices are average. A glass of Kendall Jackson chardonnay is priced in the mid $9 range. Food: we elected to split a California Chicken Club Sandwich (our appetites aren't what they were in our 20's). The sandwich arrived promptly, and that is where the good experience ended. It looked fine on top. I bit into my sandwich to encounter a bitter taste. I turned the sandwich over to discover that the bottom of the sandwich was totally black ... having been carbonized to a uniform layer of glossy black charcoal. I considered sending it back, but time constraints stopped us from doing. I wanted to take a picture, but my hands were so covered in grease at this point, I didn't want to reach into my pocket for my phone ... anyway, to visualize it, think of the glossy sheen of Darth Vader's helmet. I scraped the charcoal off the sandwich, my wife simply discarded her burned bread, and found the remaining product to be tasteless and bland. We will not be returning to this restaurant. They obviously have poor quality control, and there are plenty of better choices for your restaurant dollars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,3.4,2.84,2.84,,3.064
23,Darryl D.,"Wexford, PA",5,33,13.0,5.0,2018-01-01,"Well...... it's been two months since I last wrote a review about BJ's and I must say it was worth the wait. We stopped in Friday the 29th for dinner and I must say, everything was fantastic!  The greeters were pleasant and out preferred waitlist app worked well and out table was waiting when we arrived. Our server Nicole was one of the best I've ever had. Always there to refill a drink or remove a dish that was no longer needed and just a pleasant person that made you feel at home.  Everyone in our party was very pleased with their dinner selections and my roasted double pork chop was, without question, the best pork chop on earth!  We can't wait to return for another great dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pittsburgh,3.4,2.84,2.84,,3.064
