217,Ryan C.,"Richardson, TX",0,10,,5.0,2012-01-31,I love this place. Their brews are great. I especially love the porter. Very tasty pizzas. My favorite is the classic combo. If you have never been there before you may have to spend a lot of time reading the menu before ordering because they have a huge menu and wide variety. A little pricey perhaps but you get what you pay for. I got there during half price mini pizzas. The place is very clean and well kept. Low lighting and upscale atmosphere for a casual restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.868,3.3200000000000003

Pretty cool b/c places don't usually have cider beer. The ribeye was cooked well and perfectly juicy. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were ok. My fiance liked them better than I did. ""They're dry like I like them"", says he. The salad was nothing fancy. My fiance ate every bit of his tilapia dish and our friend loved his New York strip steak. We didn't try any dessert on this trip.

Two ordered gluten free pizza (personal size) and they advised they were delicious. The calzone and chicken fried streaks were very good. Hamburgers were large and juicy. One down side. the menu stated they had chicken wings, so an order was placed. What they served was not ""chicken wings"" but chicken nuggets. I rechecked the menu and it still stated chicken wings. Thought I was being served at a fast food joint. While the Chicken nuggets were delicious they are not ""wings"" need to change your menu. Prices are a little steep.

135,Michael C.,"Plano, TX",33,170,18.0,5.0,2012-07-22,"BJ's delivers well on what it tries to be, a brewhouse that serves food. It's a great place for lunch because they have a host of great deals and they tend to get you in and out reasonably quickly.  It can be a bit loud or distracting, so intimate/romantic chats may best be held elsewhere...but it IS a brewhouse after all. On that note, grabbing a quick bite and a beer at the bar also works great.  If you want to watch sports, they have a quartet of giant screens right over the bar and some redundant ones scattered about the restaurant. For brews, my favorite is the Jeremiah Red, a full flavor and it does not hurt that it is the strongest beer they have. For meals, I like and heartily recommend the following, if you want some advice: - Ahi Tuna Salad -  There is not a ton of protein in there, but it's very good; beware the wasabi, they made it pretty strong last time I tried it - Baby Back Pork Ribs - the meat slides right off the bone, you can eat this dish with fork) - Half Sandwich & Soup - I like to specifically get it with the Turkey Cobb & Clam Chowder - Garden Medley Salad (add Salmon) - I would add salmon to this occasionally, but it's great alone; which is good, because I believe they use farm-raised Salmon, of which one can only eat to much (because of PCBs, not mercury)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.58,3.4800000000000004

Sadly, we have seen a steady decline in service and quality. This was made abundantly clear when 5 of us decided to have lunch there on Oct 10th to celebrate a birthday. Beverage glasses were left empty, refills were few and far between. the appetizer we ordered was over done and not very good. entree's were delivered one or two at a time over a period of 20+ minutes. a nice easy work lunch took nearly two hours, the food was cold, the service really lacking.

157,Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,66.0,2.0,2012-10-16,"Well.......... as much as I hate writing negative reviews and the fact that I have been to BJ's on several occasions in the past with groups from work and had a nice time, I just can't let our latest experience pass by without mention.   Last week, hubs and I were craving pizza, which we always either make ourselves or order in, but instead said ""where can we go to sit down and have get a good pizza?""  Then it hit me, I remembered having great pizza at BJ's in past years with our friends from work.   So, off we go, looking forward to a yummie pie and some great cocktails & beer.  We ordered a pizza with EXTRA sauce and several toppings, an apple martini made with vodka, apple pucker & Midori (the original appletini recipe) and a Blue Moon beer.  Our waiter was obviously new and took his time getting out our drinks, but that's OK, completely understandable.  But, then the pizza arrived with NO sauce......  we both took a few bites and then realized what was wrong, so we explained the problem to our waiter and another pizza was promptly ordered and the original removed.   Still enjoying our drinks, they were just about gone by the time the second pizza arrived.  So another round of drinks was ordered and we dove into the pizza - we were starving at this point.   One mouth full and all our excitement about pizza night out were gone.  This one had a little bit of sauce but was undercooked as well.  It was edible, but just not what we had anticipated or what we had ordered, so we went with and enjoyed our second drink.  About 3/4 finished with the second pizza, our waiter arrives to ask if everything was good.  We explained to him the disappointment with the pizza again and he said he was sorry, etc, etc - the same BS you get from every waiter - they really don't give a RA if you enjoyed your food - they are only trained to ask this.   So, anyway we were now ready for the check and that's where things got hairy..........  We get the bill and just happened to notice we were charged for two appletinis and two ""shots"" of Midori for a total of $30 for two drinks! (No way was there an ""shot"" of Midori in my appletini.   So, my first complaint would be that there are no prices on the menu for alcohol and we were not told that requesting Midori to replace the cheap and carb-loaded ""sweet & sour"" they add for their non-traditional appletinis would add an additional $7.50 per drink.  That, on top of the really bad pizza, called for a meeting with the manager.   The manager arrived promptly to explain the cost of the Midori.  He and I had a rather heated discussion that there was not the volume of a ""shot"" in each drink to justify the charge and I asked they be removed.   He hesitated, so I explained it to him like this...... either he remove the Midori charges or he could remove the entire pizza since it was awful and had to be ordered twice.   He then agreed to remove the Midori's (of course - as they were the cheaper road to travel).  Had this happen, you would not be reading this review......... instead he removed ONE Midori and presented us with a $10 gift certificate for a return visit.   Well, that just doesn't work for me.   Don't lie to me and then try to cover the lie with the addition of a gift card.   We have no desire to return to BJ's and will pass the card on to a friend.......... or trash it - one of the two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.408,3.2000000000000006

When all the transations were done, she claims that one of my friends hadn't paid, when we clearly saw himr put a bill in the folder... She approached the situation as if we were little kids. She was rude and VERY sarcastic.. How can you wait 10 tables at a time and not get the tickets mixed up? Well, my friend talked to a manager and he wasn't so forthcoming either.

74,Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245.0,2.0,2013-05-10,"Aw man.  I hate to do this but this is gonna be one of those reviews. We were so hungry.  I had gotten a slurpee late in the afternoon and my stomach was full on high fructose corn syrup.  The Wife came home and was tired so she went to take a nap.  By 8:30, I was getting hungry and she was just getting out of bed.  She was craving pizza so off to BJ's we went. We get there and it's crazy busy.  It's 8:45 and there are still people sitting outside waiting for a table.  We go inside and ask how long the wait is.  ""oh, 15 minutes.""  That's not bad.  So we wait for about 5 minutes and our pager goes off. We sit down and we know we want pizza so we order a half BJ's favorite and half Sweet Pig.  Then we wait.  It feels like forever and the Wife thinks it took about 30 minutes.  It finally comes out and as the server puts it on the pizza stand, I immediately spot a long curly (not kinky, mind you) hair on the pizza. Server: ""Would you like me to serve you your first piece of pizza?"" Me: ""There's a hair on it."" She says, ""Yup,"" and immediately takes it back to the kitchen. The Wife, ""Why'd you say that?!  I'm so hungry."" Me: ""There was a hair.  I couldn't help myself."" So the server comes back and says, ""They're making you another pizza because that is gross."" Me: ""We're so hungry..."" Server: ""Would you like me to bring you a cup of soup or a salad?"" Me: ""What do you have?""  (server lists off soups) ""Oooh clam chowder!"" The Wife: ""I'd like the tomato and mozzarella salad."" The server comes back in like 5 minutes with our starters and I will have to say, this is the best part of our meal.  The chowder was perfect.  I've probably only once had better chowder and that was in San Francisco.  This soup had a TON of clam in it.  It was thick and hearty like it should be and had the perfect texture.  You know how some clam chowder is really thin or it has a ton of potato and no clam?  This was exactly how you would want it. The Wife's salad was very good too.  It was actually a decent sized salad.  She commented that if she wanted a light dinner, this might be enough. Then came the pizza.  I'm sad to say that about 2/3 of the pizza was sweet pig and 1/3 was BJ's favorite at best.  Then of course, there are the overlap areas so technically only about 1/4 of the pizza was strictly BJ's favorite.  I was going to say something but we had already sent a pizza back for the hair and it was just getting too ridiculous.  On top of that, the pizza had been rushed and wasn't baked enough.  The crust was doughy and soggy.  Disappointing at best.  =o/ *sigh* I am very glad that they made up for our hunger with free starters.  That was very classy of them, but rushing the pizza was not the right choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=60,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6320000000000006,2.96

I would not recommend this if you are not a fan of the strong blue cheese flavor. The pasta I ordered was okay. It was not really special or anything.  However, if you plan on going here, be sure to leave room for dessert. The pazookies are just amazing. It's probably a good idea to share one with another person, because each pazookie is quite big. We ordered the triple chocolate pazookie and it was like a piece of heaven. Just amazing.  In summary: Appetizers and main meals aren't very special, but the desserts are definitely worth the visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=200,2.64,2.64,2.64,3.12,2.64

Happy hour ends at 7 pm and it is only applicable in the bar area. The calamari here is super tasty and crunchy. And the pizookie (giant cookie in a tin) is a giant tin of happiness with a scoop of ice cream plopped on top.

This strip of highway has several eating options, including Redneck Heaven (which the man at the Harley dealership enthusiastically recommended) but we decided on BJ's simply because we were starving and we were close.  It was around 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't busy and there was no wait...well, not for a table, at least. We did have to wait about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us standing by the hostess stand, and when they did greet us, they offered no apology for the wait. Instead, the young man who came to the desk looked at us and said, ""how can I help you?"" Uh, a table so we can eat would be a good start? Not sure what the purpose of asking this question was...very strange.  Anyway, once we were seated our waitress came over and took our drink order. A few (10 or so) minutes later she came back and took our food order and brought the drinks. We ordered a deep dish vegetarian pizza with chips and salsa to start.  The chips and salsa were kind of weird, the chips weren't crispy. More soggy and very salty. The salsa was okay though. The pizza came out a while later and it was fine. Nothing great, but not bad either. It was bigger than we were expecting so we only ended up eating a few slices each.  We weren't offered refills on drinks or dessert so we just paid the bill and left.

The service, especially if you know who to ask for, is excellent. I have never had bad service when I ask for someone by name.  Never!  I ask for Lauren M. unless she's tending bar.  She is awesome & deserves 5 stars. Best ever.  Friendly, charming, on top of her game. Jay is great, but he is usually at the bar so I don't sit with him as often since I prefer a booth. Blake is also very good, very efficient and goes the extra mile.  Leah is great and so is Casey.   There are lots of great servers, it's hard to get bad service unless maybe you get a new server or someone is having an off day. The menu offers so many different choices you could eat there for days...even weeks...and not repeat.  I love the clam chowder loaf, all of the burgers, the chili loaf, the onion strings.  The pizza is wonderful and if you love micro-brews, this is the place for you.  The food is always served at the appropriate temperature which I appreciate. I love the atmosphere and usually sit in one of the booths in the bar area which is open seating.  There are also many cozy booths around the edge of the restaurant if you want a less noisy location.  The bar is definitely more noisy than the restaurant, but not outrageously loud. The management is very caring and will walk around to check out the operations.  Michael M. is the GM and he gets to know all the regulars by name.  Michael M's other managers are all good and always willing to help with any problems that might occur, although rarely have I had a problem of any kind. The hot cookie desserts are amazing and not to be missed. Parking is plentiful and free.  The best time to go is right when they open for lunch  which is 10 am on weekends or 11 am during the week.  This restaurant is very popular and in my humble opinion, the best of the BJs in Dallas.  If you go for dinner, especially on the weekends, go early.   They have a wonderful take-out operation so if you want the food, but don't want to wait for a table, you can order and have your food to go very quickly.

Thankfully this wasn't our first trip or we wouldn't be back. Although, we will probably not give our business to this location anymore related to the lackadaisical manager. So we arrived at 5pm on a Saturday, beers came out quickly and we ordered at 5:10. By 5:50 I'm looking around for our server to ask why it is taking our food so long. Finally at 5:55 it arrives. I had subbed my fries for broccoli and you should have seen the amount I got. 3 pieces as a side? Not to mention it was cold! Both my grandmother and grandfather's food was cold as well. So we get our server and explain the situation (and also that the 3 twenty something's at the table were servers) and I ask to speak to a manager. This guy didn't tell me his name, but he was a heavy set middle aged white guy with glasses. He could not have given two shits less about everything and instead went off on a tangent with my grandpa about wedge fries vs thin cut fries. My grandmother not wanting to create a problem said her food was ""edible"" and in the restaurant world that screams FIX IT! When he left the table I was fuming more than before! I told our server (who was very helpful and caught in the middle of a situation out of his control) that his manager was useless and could not have cared less. Our new sides arrived (still ridiculously small), my grandma ate her cold pasta and we left. The manager took my sandwich off the bill, but honestly if he had just acted like he cared more I wouldn't have even wanted that. At that point he needed to do more than take off a $9 sandwich though because not only did he not fix the situation, he multiplied my anger.

In comparison to Yard House, a similar concept, BJ's is more family-oriented and less trendy. Yard House usually has 50 or so craft beers, while BJ's focuses more on their own beers and only offers a few craft beers.  We arrived around 6:15pm and as such, we were able to order drinks at the happy hour pricing. I really enjoyed the IPA brewed by BJ's.  We shared a deep dish pizza. Although we were turned off by the pricing - $23 for a large! - I have to admit the pizza was quite good. Unlike traditional Chicago deep dish, the crust has a nice, lightly crunch cook on the outside. The dough and fillings make up a light & fluffy inside. A large is easily splittable by 4 people- or you can take home leftovers like we did.  Our server was great!

The salad was a small portion, pretty simple paired with vinaigrette, the flatbread on the other hand wasn't so good, I think mainly because they flavored it with a lot of ranch sauce, too heavy and it overlaps the natural flavor of the chicken, avocado, and I believe bacon or pepperoni, I ended up having to wipe some of the ranch sauce off.  Service was below average, we waited around a few times not being checked up on, but in their defense, lunch time is a packed house, also when they gave me my flatbread they accidentally swapped my order with a gentlemen from another table... Still gave it to me because apparently he hasn't touched it. Not the most appetizing start but I was starving, after the few waiting periods.

From salads and quinoa bowls to pizzas, steaks, wings, pastas, and grilled cheese sandwiches; there's an option for everyone. I really enjoy eating their burgers with wedge fries but I heard their deep dish pizza is a good option as well. Their appetizers are pretty large so feel free to order one to eat as your entree. I recommend getting the grilled chicken flat bread pizza which comes with chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and bacon.  As for their pizookies, they come in two sizes: regular and small. A small is about 3-4inches in diameter and is usually enough for around 3 people to share. My favorite would be the chocolate chunk or white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie but if it's your first time here and you're not quite sure what to get, they have a trio option which allows you to choose 3 different small pizookies with a scoop of icecream on each.    Their service was not the best. The waiter seemed to be in a rush to give us our checks and only refilled our waters twice during our dine in even though we were out of water.

They offer a variety of meals, including some gluten free options, which is wonderful for those who, like myself, have a gluten sensitivity. Food aside, this review is more about the service, or lack there of, each and every time we visit.  My husband and I are young. I'm going to assume this alone gives waiters the impression that they can be a little more lax with us and treat us more like buddies than paying customers. We also both order water because we actually just LOVE water. There is a shift in service after the drink orders as well we've noticed. I suppose they think we are trying to save some dollars where we can? Be cheap customers? Can't say for sure. Our most recent visit was the last straw. My husband and I were seated at the two person booth right next to two tables that sat four. Our server gave great attention to those tables while we were ignored. We had to get our waiters attention to ask for an appetizer because we weren't even asked if we were interested in one.  For the entree my husband asked for tomatoes on his pizza which weren't even there. He told the waiter to which he replied - ""Oh, they are there, they're just really small."" Really? He didn't refill our waters not once even though we put them in clear view at the edge of the table. We were left with empty glasses for the last 20 minutes of us being there. He then walked by to drop off the check in the middle of us eating without saying a word. By the way, we had planned on getting dessert. It would have been nice if this were offered instead of, what felt like, him rushing us out of his section by placing the check down two bites into our entrees. We had to again call his name as he was walking away from one of his two tables of four to ask for dessert...to which he barely acknowledged with a nod before running off.  All around just awful service. My husband used to be a waiter and I worked in the food industry for 6 years. We both understand working for tips, so we always tip well even if it wasn't deserved. It is a shame that we get stereotyped as ""that young couple that probably won't tip well so we shouldn't even bother with giving them great service"". It is frustrating and insulting.

Later that night I had basically the same burger for $6.50. Four of us generated a lunch bill of $74.00, plus tax and tip. They are nice clean restaurants and normally have good service but the high prices lower the overall value rating so it is not on my future agenda.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=20,3.04,3.18,3.18,,3.1240000000000006

Once again, after making a reservation AND talking with a ""manager"" our group of 20 had to wait for a table to be made ready for us WHICH took half an hour. But dog forbid they should be ready for people who plan ahead and notify a restaurant that a large party would be arriving on a certain date and time. It WAS nice to see that they had NO problem seating a party of 14 who walked in without a reservation.  Cold food, waiters who had NO idea of where to put the food, ""oh, not finished your soup yet sir, here let me place this plate of ribs on your soup bowl then"".  ""Your turkey burger is cold?

He is sharp, quick with the refills, and very in tune with what we needed throughout the meal. Jory was attentive without being bothersome. He gave Grandpa an extra scoop of ice cream on the pazookie and time to open up the gifts before he brought us the bill. What a personable young man!

The bar staff were friendly, but no Bushmills.  I settled on something else and waited.  At the 40 minute mark, we were told they were ready for us.  It was a booth and that wouldn't work with our group.  So we waited another 10 minutes and a table was ready.   As we were sitting down, the staff dropped a drink which splattered on my open toes and my cast.  As a couple of wait-staff began cleaning up the liquid, another dropped his tray with a loud bang.  Three times during the meal, one of the waiters knocked into my chair. Of all of those incidents; one apology on a chair bump.   The food was delivered with the expected confusion for a large party's order.  All was quickly sorted out. A couple noted the pizzas were not really well cooked. The rest loved their meals. We ordered desserts and for some reason, one was brought to go (mine).  (I guess they really wanted me to leave?) The billing was also a problem and took a couple of tries.   Other than that, the server was attentive. Another note, the background music was quite loud which required all to have to talk loud.  My ears were actually ring when we left!     Perhaps it was the party size?  The crowded Friday?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano,3.08,3.19,3.19,,3.146

The menu has a great range of various items for the health conscious to the eh... fried conscious *shamelessly raises hand*.  I will say, if you are one that gets a bit overwhelmed with a small novella menu of options, stay focused...they have a lot of options :)   The food here is always great and reasonably priced.  This trip I had the California Club Sandwich, which was a grilled chicken breast with cheese, avocado on toasted bread.  It was very good. My work colleagues said that the Ahi Tuna salad was great as well as the BBQ sandwich.

I chose this establishment for my sister's birthday to accommodate some picky eaters in our party.  We ordered a couple of appetizers, classic fried mozzarella sticks & spinach artichoke dip. Basic as it gets.  What really bothered me are the plates. They were so filthy, greasy and wet. I had to find another server to switch them out. Only to get another set that were just as disgusting. That really pissed me off. I couldn't help to think how unsanitary the kitchen is, how they prep, handle food and drinks.  They also had no Chimay and Heineken in stock. I ordered the deep dish pizza. Pretty much raw vegetables thrown on top.. the line cook may have hoped it'll finish cooking from the residual heat? The meat, pepperoni, sausage couldn't taste anymore fake than it was. I also ordered a side caesar salad, dressing on the side. It was on the side alright, but recall the dirty plates? My ramekin was most likely was pulled from the dish pit (see pic), crusted with old food and oil, nestled on my salad. Perhaps the dishwasher might not have been working properly tonight?  We brought our own birthday cake and was given to our server before the meal. When it came time, I expected the server to at least get it out of the box and place the candles on it. Nope. We had to open it up and prepare everything in front of my sister. Nice cake surprise presentation huh?  The managers never stopped by to do quality or experience checks. One of them dropped glassware next to our table. Didn't apologize or made sure the other guests were okay. To top it off, he picked up the shards with his bare hands.  Careless in all ways possible.

Just tell the server the name of the branded beer that you love and they will tell you their matching or similar beers (typical of brewery) !! I love their enlightened menu options as well. Great service on this location. A minor issue happened where our tables were cleared after we went to the restrooms. We had asked to have the leftovers to-go'ed. But tables got cleared by mistake. Manager was courteous enough to get us the complete new order of our food made and packed to-go (in 5-10 mins) along with an apology.

52,Lisa P.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,2,,5.0,2017-07-12,"This started as a 1 star review. We were very disappointed. Our waitress was inattentive, did not give us plates for our appetizers or silverware. Our food was not cooked properly and overall was a disaster. We we about ready to chalk it up as a bad dining experience. However, the look of distraught in my face caught the eye of another server. Colin. He had the decency to stop at our table even though he was carrying an arm full of drinks to another table, to ask if we were ok. After we told him we were not having the best experience he sent the manager over. The manager Brandon, was more than apologetic and not only gave us new property cooked entrees but his demeanor was incredibly sympathetic. After that he sent an amazing young man to take care of our needs. Benjamin. Ben was attentive and took care of us in every way. He made sure he checked on our needs frequently. The 3 of these young men made my birthday night out with my husband turn from disappointing to amazing. I thank them for listening to our concerns and not only addressing them but making them a priority. What a wonderful team to turn things around for the guests. Thank you Colin, Brandon and Ben for making things amazing for us.

It came with a garlic knot and the knot was hard as a rock, so we didn't bother eating it, wasn't very appetizing. We had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, those were cooked to perfection. Very yummy, will order every time I go there!! Service was exceptional, as usual. The energy there is always great too, it's a great place to catch games and drink some beers.
