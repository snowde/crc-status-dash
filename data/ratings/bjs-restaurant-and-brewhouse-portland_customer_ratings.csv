183,Rachelle C.,"Vancouver, WA",2,22,1.0,4.0,2012-02-11,"We're originally from San Diego, so we were familiar with BJ's before moving here.  This location was alright, we went for lunch on a Sunday and it was busy but we were seated right away.  We started our meal with some appetizers, the spinach and artichoke dip was alright, I found it a little salty and wished they served it with toasted bread instead of tortilla chips :( We also had some fried artichoke hearts, these were crunchy and yummy when paired with ranch, (on their own seemed just a little on the bland side) and we had some chicken flatbread pizza.  The pizza was really more like a cracker with toppings, it could hardly be considered a pizza, it was ok.  For lunch I had the salmon with veggies and my husband ordered a double jalapeno burger.  My food was good though I didn't care for the sauce they poured over it and my husband raved about his burger.  Overall it was a good trip, slightly overpriced, but decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=200,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.568,3.4800000000000004

Great white mini pizza (chicken) and a combo mini pizza. Great flavor, could go a little lighter on the tomatoes but it is easy to pull a couple off. And for desert, triple chocolate pizookie. Warm chocolate brownie, chocolate ice cream, and Gherideli chocolate, as a big chocolate fan, I was in heaven. Happy hour half price mini pizzas allowed me to experiment with the flavors, saw a variety of food go by that I really wanted to reach out and sample. I will be back. My wife had the vegi calzone (you don't see this on the menu very often) and said it was good, and loved her white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. I go on, but basically if you near one of these, you need to give them a try, excellent variety on the menu, and great prices. On the drinks, good beer selection and my wife said her Bloody Mary was very good, and probably a little stronger than she gets at most places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.668,3.5600000000000005

I love their diverse and fairly expansive menu that offers food for all moods. I love their brewskies...now there's a shock...(Portlander who loves beer!) My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the P.M. Porter, but I do enjoy most of them. I've come here both in California and the Portland location many times and mostly for their mini pizzas and to indulge on one of their famous and delicious Pizookies. Their pizzas are sort of a hybrid of what most are used to and a Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza right down to the Corn Meal infused sweeter crust. I love their inventiveness and creativity on some of them pies. If I have room I simply must cram down one of their famous Pizookies which is a choice of a large warm cookie with two scoops of creamy vanilla bean ice cream on top! My eyes roll in the back of my head with every bite. Oh oh back to the pizza. I find them filled with multiple textures and flavors that have my taste buds tingling and my soul warmed. This location is much smaller than what I'm used to, but still offers three types of seating: either booths, regular tables, or up at their bar. Decor is modern and clean and consistent with most other locations. Service has always been kind, patient, and informative which I can totally appreciate. I find their prices to be pretty reasonable for not only being a chain, but also for having such a large menu. There is plenty of parking, but close parking can still prove kind of challenging during busier periods! Their website is well laid out, easily navigable, and informative.

My daughter and her friend got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. All were great!

Small but nicely priced selection of happy hour drinks and food. You can't go wrong with a strawberry mojito for $5. The California flatbread was good, too. Their burgers have small patties which was a bummer. I was so happy to see that they serve clam chowder in a sourdough bowl - I have been searching for a good chowder and sourdough together. The clam chowder was really delicious with large tender pieces of clam that you can bite right through and aren't rubbery at all. They lightly toast the sourdough bowl which I liked. I can't say that it was the best sourdough but it was pretty darn decent.  BJ's offers a nice menu with a good selection. I'm thinking our next visit we will have to try their pizza since we enjoyed the flatbread so much.

I love the big high backed round booth we sat in. Made for good privacy since we were at the beginning of the dinner rush.  The menu is pretty massive so it took us a bit to take it all in before we ordered. My hubby and I ordered the same thing, which rarely happens. Both of us settled on a roast beef dip sammy. My 10 year old got chicken tenders and my 9year old had cheeseburger sliders. They both had a cookies and cream puzookie for dessert. Our energetic waitress (whos name escapes me ATM damn it I hate when I do that) was knowledgeable on the menu and super sweet. When our dinners arrived, they made kind of a big deal over it by having three of the wait staff bring it to our table and teasing our daughters over who got what which I thought was a sweet thing to do. My sandwich was piled high with moist and tender roast beef. It did have cheese and also some thin sliced caramelized onions and all came on a great baguette.  It also came with some herbed au jus and horseradish for dipping which had great flavor as well. Then some thick cut steak fries. I guess you can pick those or shoestring. Washed it all down with a glass of ice cold Dr. Pepper. My daughters had no complaints and love their puzookie dessert (a puzookie is a hot fresh baked cookie of your choice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dollop of flavored whipped cream).

126,Kimiko F.,"Vancouver, WA",28,23,4.0,2.0,2016-05-09,"Came in for Mothers Day, expecting that all dining places would be busy... Unfortunately even expecting longer than normal service didn't prepare us for the 2 1/2 hour waiting game.  My mother in law wanted to dine here because of the Avocado rolls. Unfortunately they added spicy peppers or made them more predominant in the recipe because she could barely finish one.  The stuffed mushrooms were great (along with the monkey bread pizookie), but that is where our satisfaction ended.  First, either our server had been working a double or has incredibly short memory. The table next to us asked for a lime for a drink 3 times (after the initial drink order) before she actually brought it over.  We ordered appetizers, and no plates, napkins or utensils were brought till we asked for them.  My daughter ordered orange juice but it was too tart for her so we asked for another water... Over the next 2 hours, the waitress refilled our drinks, brought our food and never brought the water despite being asked no less than 6 times for another water to be brought to the table.  As a former waitress, I try to be understanding, but she seemed to be in lala land. We also were casually talking about birthing stories since I'm expecting my second child, and she chimes in with a 3 minute story about herself (and still forgot the water).  Admittedly, I asked for a modified menu item, so I was expecting an upcharge or possible confusion. I ordered a seared ahi salad, but since I don't like seared ahi but wanted the salad (which they don't sell on its own ala cart), I asked to substitute seared ahi for the poke. They brought out the salad with raw, unseasoned fish (fish cubes). Poke is a Japanese item that is popular in Hawai'i (where I'm from) that is traditionally sesame oil, soy sauce, sea salt, green onions and other flavors with raw ahi tune cubes.  The first time I sent it back, they brought it back supposedly coated in sauce. Tried a piece and was definitely still just raw fish no seasoning.  We asked for a manager and I explained that if the substitution was not possible I'd order something else. He took it back and actually had the ahi poke made according to the recipe for the appetizer (which is what I expected the first time).  The burgers that my husband and brother in law had were overcooked. And everything seemed priced $5-15 over other establishments that make better food.  Unfortunately, unless I'm craving stuffed mushrooms or monkey bread (Cinnabon is better), we will probably not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=40,3.68,3.51,3.51,2.7280000000000006,3.5780000000000003

A long menu offering pizza, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, fish, steak, ribs, salads and more, I couldn't decide on what I wanted.  Finally got some chicken wings which were the wingless type, so more like long chicken nuggets.  The waitress brought three sauces to try.  The husband really liked the root beer sauce.  Their odd version of ranch was bad.  We shared some avocado rolls that were subpar - burnt on the edges, lacking seasoning and mostly a weird mashup of cream cheese with some sprinkled shredded carrot and a dash of parsley.  The menu said they came with sundried tomatoes, cilantro, red onions, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices - nope to all of that. See my picture.  Husband got the spicy chicken with peanut sauce and soba noodles and said it was all right.  We shared a salted caramel pazookie which was a mooshy, hot cookie with caramel and salted caramel ice cream sprinkled with chocolate chips - that was really good. The waitress checked on us often and was helpful but not in our face.  The hostess didn't seat us, telling us to go seat ourselves in the bar area which I thought was odd.

I had to ask to have my drink refilled do to slow service. The appetizers came out at the same time our food did. The food was very good. They left the table next to us full of the dirty plates and glasses from the people who were sitting there for about 15 minutes. Then one person came and grabbed the plates, another person came and got the cups and cleaned the table half ass. Then the hostess had to come clean the table and seats because the 2nd person did a terrible job. So it took them 20 minutes to get that table ready for another group to sit down.

With tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions."" The salad I saw when I opened the box at home was about half the size of the salad I previously enjoyed, had about half the number of the seared tuna, had a few chunks of tomatoes, maybe a couple slices of red peppers, and absolutely NO AVOCADO, PICKLED CUCUMBER, CILANTRO, GREEN ONIONS OR WASABI. The host was nice as always, and it was busy in there.  However, I paid almost $16 for a salad that wasn't even worth $5. It would be one thing if I ordered it and it contained everything listed on the menu description and I just didn't like it, but to leave out the good stuff? C'mon.  And the avocado egg rolls were somehow tiny and so very lacking compared to previous orders.  These items were a far cry from BJ's back in the day.
