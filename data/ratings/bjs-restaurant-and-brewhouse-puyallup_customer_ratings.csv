196,Coryn S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,12,3.0,2.0,2013-04-07,"I was hesitant to write a review because the place JUST opened about 1 week ago but I feel the wait staff needs major improvements. For one, there were SO many staff members it was crazy! We had a total of 4 or 5 waiters/waitresses come to our table alone and none of them were communicating with each other on if/when we had ordered our drinks or our food. We were asked for our ID's twice. We were never offered water!  We had to ask for napkins. Food came out warm, not hot. They asked us if we were aware of their points card. They explained that you receive 1 point per dollar spent so we asked them to sign us up. NEVER got the card. After spending $78 there on food and drinks, it would have been nice to have those points credited. We may go back once the place has settled in more and the wait staff knows their left hand from their right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=200,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004
157,Marissa L.,"Tacoma, WA",101,283,100.0,3.0,2013-04-15,"I've loved BJ's food since I lived in California and was finally able to convince the boyfriend to go with me for a late lunch yesterday. When we got there the wait for a 2 top was 15 minutes so we hunted down 2 seats at the bar. The food as usual was yummy. I had the fried artichokes which happen to be a personal favorite and did not disappoint. I also tried their new Black and Blue appetizer flatbread pizza which was good, but could have been a little more crispy. Josh had an asian salad of some kind which he thought was OK, but it took him awhile to locate some of the supposed ingredients (like mango) and it appeared that the kitchen was in a rush as they barely cut the avocado on top leaving Josh to have to cut it on top of the salad (not cool). As to the service it started out fine, and progressively slipped. At the start of the meal I asked the bartender to please split the check as we were going ""dutch"" on this date. I am quite sure she heard me because she said ok and nodded. Every time she added something we ordered she came back with one slip (I thought maybe it was split on the one check so I didn't sweat it and never picked it up). After a fairly long wait for our food I looked at the check to find it was NOT split. By this point our bartender serving us had disappeared. The new bartender seemed to take forever t help us and when he did there was apparently nothing he could do because the check was on the other girls name...While he was attempting to find someone to help she whizzed by the back of me claiming she ""had to go"" and touched my back asking if I was ready to pay. The new bartender then explained I wanted the checks split so she then split the checks and disappeared again. We waited about another 5 minutes to have them collect our credit cards so we could pay and leave. It's a good thing I enjoy their food cause the service left a lot to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=180,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

We went to BJ's for the first time last weekend, everything started out fine until about 45 minutes had past and we were still waiting for our food, and no server in sight. When our food did finally come out (not even all of it because mine was apparently still not ready) it was ALL very cold, like it had all been sitting out for quite a while. When mine finally came, my fries were hot but the rest was ice cold! We let our server know that all the food was cold and asked nicely if he could just take it off the bill because we were not going to eat any of it, nor did we want to sit and wait for another HOUR for them to microwave our meals. I am not a picky eater, but our food wasn't even lukewarm and it wasn't something I was going to let my children eat when God knows how long it sat out.

When our food came out it was a turkey club and the fettuccine Alfredo. i didn't order the turkey club, honest mistake I get it. Not once were we asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks after that missed  order  nor did the waiter acknowledge us as he helped others around us.  After watching my wife gnaw on the hard as a rock garlic bread that came with her fettuccine Alfredo my grilled chicken club finally came out, it was mediocre, and there was no ketchup in sight nor was I asked if I needed one. We flagged down someone to get more refills and ketchup. There's a grip of workers there for such horrible service.

Over 30 minutes later we finally received our appetizer, cheesy bacon potato skins. Needless to say there was barely any bacon or cheese on them. Our waitress came to our table many times to apologize for the wait at the same time neglecting to bring us new drinks that's had been sitting empty or removing the finished appetizer tray.

I didn't even go to BJ's ever in my life until this year actually. I am sad I didn't discover it sooner!  Now, what I really like about this place is their cocktail drinks! Yumm much? I had some kind of berry mojito awhile back, ordered a strawberry splash [I think it was called] recently with another side of Raspberry Lemon Drop. The Strawberry Splash was amazingly sweet, definitely was in the mood for a blended alcoholic beverage but the lemondrop was ehh... too hard on the taste. I also ordered a ""half"" order of boneless wings (Which is great because I don't want the whole 10 pcs by myself! Sitting at the bar is fun [just turned 21 this year]. By myself, not so much maybe but... I think the bar is an okay place for me to sit around when I feel like being alone rather than occupying a huge booth all to myself... catching peoples' attentions thinking, ""She's by herself..."" Definitely will be stopping by once in awhile after work for a drink or two. Oh I forgot, I was so caught up in my memories of sipping delicious cocktails, the service... was a 2-3 stars worth.

The clam chowder seemed to be canned. The fettuccine Alfredo returned only to be in the same condition.  This time my husband said never mind he didn't want it back or anything else.  The waitress apologized and said she would have the manager come over to talk to us while she got boxes for my son and my leftover food.  She came back with our boxes, grabbed our card for payment, and came back.  The manager never came to talk to us.  Needless to say the service was poor and the fact that the manager didn't even come to offer an apology speaks volumes.  The waitress said she told him 2x to come see us.

203,Jon T.,"Tacoma, WA",9,232,2.0,3.0,2013-06-27,"In my opinion, you generally know what you are getting into with a Restaurant like BJ's.  Brewhouse as a name is somewhat of a misnomer.  They ""contract"" out their brewing operations to I think two or three companies.  As a whole though, you could do a lot worse.  Food is fairly consistent, although on occassion we find some variances on some of our favorite dishes between Tacoma, Puyallup, Tukwila, and others that we may visit.  Things like the fish and chips and baked potato can vary based on our experience.  While I appreciate the selection of beer, it is disappointing that the Happy Hour pricing is only available in the bar area.  This unfortunately limits some clientel because of that limitation from having appetizers and drinks at a discount.  The parking spaces at this location are terribly narrow.  I suggest parking closer to the ""road"" that goes through the mall.  You may find a little more room to open your door. Much of the negative comments on this particular location seem to have ironed out over the past several weeks since opening.  If you had a bad experience in the weeks immediately after opening, it may be worth a second look. I do find all the Stalinist artwork a little amusing.  But so long as they continue to have a good beer selection they could put Kim Jung Il on the wall and I probably wouldn't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=220,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

They did not bring plates for us to eat from so we were both eating over the one main plate. We wanted to ask for small plates but our waitress was not around. We were there after the dinner rush - 8:30 and it took over half an hour for us to get our meal. My husband ordered the boneless chicken wings and was very disappointed. The chicken  was poor quality pressed meat, like a chicken McNugget. The celery that came with it was hot on his plate. Maybe they should wait to add the celery until they bring it out, not let it sit with the chicken under the warming lights. In the bar, the tables are placed very close to each other, so you are practically elbow to elbow with strangers. Beware of the parking lot - the spaces are all for compact cars and you will probably get a door ding. All that being said, I do like some of the other items I have ordered. The stuffed mushrooms are a very good deal. I liked the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps very much. I also like the veggie flat bread pizza. i was also pleased with their happy hour offerings.

Their fries are very thin, which is unusual, but a nice change from the steak cut fries at every other place. The pot roast is tender and the veggies that come with it are presented beautifully on the plate. I've tried several of their handcrafted non-alcoholic drinks (cream soda, root beer, etc) and they too were good....though not much different in taste than name brands.

The good:  The restaurant was clean.  Our server was pretty nice, and she was pretty good at making sure we had full drinks.  My 9 year old really liked the chicken alfredo.  She said it was some of the best she's ever had. They had lots of TVs and it looked like they had a decent bar area. The food:  I ordered the California burger cooked medium with the thin cut fries and a side salad with Italian dressing.  One of my daughters had the Chicken Alfredo and the other had a personal sized pizza with black olives.   The burger was cooked as I ordered, but tasted very bland.  It was as if there was no seasoning added to the meat at all.  The fries were chewy and also flavorless.  The salad itself was pretty fresh, but the dressing was bland and they definitely skimped on the quantity. I didn't eat either of my daughters' meals, but the pizza was overcooked.  As I mentioned earlier, my other daughter really liked the chicken alfredo. Although our server was good at keeping our drinks filled, she also hovered while I was reviewing the bill.  At a total of $50 for three meals, definitely not worth it.  I probably will not return to BJ's unless I'm meeting up with some friends to watch football.  Even then, it wouldn't be my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=120,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.6000000000000005,2.48

The layout is very similar to Tacoma, although there are a few distinct differences in the décor. It seems like the Puyallup location is a little more dim than the Tacoma location, and I really like that about the restaurant. It creates a certain ambience. As with all BJ's location, there is a separate bar area with plenty of seating or plenty of tables and booths in the spacious dining room. If you want to watch the game on television, I recommend sitting at the bar for the best view. They even have free Wi-Fi. No matter when I go, there is always a good crowd at BJ's. They have a huge menu with pizza, appetizers, salads, burgers, steak, chicken, desserts, and not to mention all of their specialty beer/ale. The pricing is very reasonable, and they offer a discount for military service members. There is also a rewards program called Premier Rewards which will allow you to accumulate points that can be redeemed for food and beverages. They also recently launched a mobile app that can be downloaded and customers can place dine-in orders in advance of arriving at the restaurant, access a preferred waitlist and view wait times, and even pay the bill directly from the phone.

We're seated at our table and waited about 15 minutes before being asked about beverages, and apparently water isn't a given anymore? Whatever. Anyways we ordered appetizers. Took about 30 minutes to get those, whatever. We got avocado rolls and flatbread pizza. The flatbread pizza is comparable to a Tony's Party Pizza for $1 at the grocery store, the avocado rolls we're the only good thing I ate all night. Oh! and we were asked if we'd like to order our meals while we were waiting for our appetizers because apparently we had been waiting awhile already. So we finish the appetizers and we're talking, and waiting..... Waiting some more..... WAITING. NO ONE came to say ""Hey sorry it's taking so long"", ""Your food will be right out"", or ""Can I get you anything else while you wait"". NOTHING.  After about an hour and a half of being there we finally get ours meals, just as we were about to stand up and investigate this wait. Well, the food was not worth the wait. Subpar burgers, tastless pasta, and blah overall. While we were eating our meals we ordered our dessert as well so we wouldn't have to wait again. We order the famous cookie pie. Again, disappointed. It's hot cookie dough with some ice cream....  OH I also forgot to mention we had two small children with us patiently waiting thru all this without any screaming episodes, they were troopers. Needless to say, we will NEVER be back. We also will not recommend to anyone.  *Side note, my fiance ordered a beer while we were waiting to be seated and the bartender served him the wrong beer.

After spending an amazing day at Del Mar Beach, we discovered an awesome, California home, restaurant called BJs. We were astonished by the awesome food and how we wished they had one back home in Western Washington.  A year or so after that, we finally moseyed our way out to Tacoma for my birthday celebration at the much anticipated BJs Tacoma. And let me say, I was thoroughly embarrassed and mortified at the terrible experience we had there to the point of me losing their business forever. So, I guess I was pretty skeptical about eating there tonight, especially since the mixed reviews seem limitless. Earlier tonight, we walked in to a great service and atmosphere and literally no wait to be seated which was a fantastic upgrade from their crappy Tacoma location. All of waitresses were very kind and courteous. I started with the appetizer of chicken wings which were really good :) And believe me, I KNOW chicken wings! Then for my entree, I got a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage! It was delishhhhh. And then to end things off, I got the new salted caramel pizzookie and that, my friends, will hit every single sweet tooth in your body :) Again, the atmosphere and service was superb which is huge upgrade from Tacoma. My one and only con, is that it was a tad slow, but that's all. Overall, I found a new respect and love for this franchise. Love it!! Totally recommend!! Oh and I dunno why but the pics below are from my accidentally deleted review of their Tacoma location and I don't know why they showed up here :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=60,2.88,2.88,2.88,3.024,2.88

Please read this!        I came in for lunch today and I decided to get  the half sandwich and soup or salad.  I ordered the California chicken sandwich which had pepper jack cheese, green chilies, grilled chicken, avocado, Chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough. I found out it not only comes with soup or salad, but it also comes with ether thin fries or wedge season fries. I asked for the think crispy fries and asked for a house salad. I loved everything about my meal. The sandwich was not spicy at all but yet very good. The salad was really good I asked for balsamic vinaigrette and that was awsome I left both of my plates clean.

Anyway...Moving on. Even though it's not a true deep dish pizza, I'm still VERY surprised that this place is rated so low!  This has actually become one of our favorite places to go out to eat and have a couple of drinks.  The pizza may not be a Chicago pizza, but it's still a darn good pizza. We've been here probably 5-6 times and have never had bad service.  (HUGE shoutout to our awesome waitresses: Samantha W, Elsy P, Rebecca P!).  We don't go in expecting service to be quick - It's a big place, is busy, and it's not someplace where you're going to get your food in ten minutes. The last time we went, the boyfriend got a burger instead of pizza and it was okay - I'm going to stick with pizza though.  They tried to put ""grill marks"" on the burger and it ended up being medium on the inside (how he likes it) but with a burnt outside (NOT how he likes it).  It wasn't bad, but I don't think we'll be getting it again. The drinks...Ohhhhhhhhhhhh the drinks.  :)  I'm a big fan of the watermelon mojito but I also recently tried the Pomegrante Paradise (so good!) and our new favorite drink is the Irish Root Beer: Bailys, Jameson, and root beer. This tastes like root beer and cream soda had a baby and it's beautiful.  Don't be fooled - There's a LOT of alcohol in it but it doesn't taste like it.  We will go back again JUST for this drink...Or eight.  :) Again, pretty surprised at the low reviews, but we like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=60,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.0600000000000005,3.0800000000000005

I complained to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. When she returned, she asked if I wanted something else instead - I said no, since the literal garbage in my salad had rather affected my appetite, but that I didn't feel I should pay for it. ""Oh no,"" she replied, ""the manager took care of that.""  When my bill arrived, I was surprised to find that the manager had given me a 50% discount on my lunch - $3.50 off for the salad. I had expected to either not get a bill or to have my lunch not charged but... I paid it and will not be returning anytime soon.

They offer cute little half pints, which is so great- that way you can sample different beers but have more than a little shot sample. Buffalo wings were nice and spicy. We got a little 5-meat deep dish pizza and we were SO SAD that we hadn't gone here for Alex's birthday dinner instead of freaking lame Farelli's. Alex said the deep dish crust might have been the same as pizza huts frozen crust.. which is fine, since he loves it.

I have been by it several times and it appears to be a very nice establishment. After reading the reviews, it seems that it may need a lot of training on the service side of things. I am going to give it a shot, but you have a lot to live up to. One is that the food service should not be more than 12-14 minutes from time of ordering to delivery for the entrees and 7-8 minutes for the appetizers upon delivery. The beverages should never be more than 5 minutes. And, when the beverages come out so should the flatware and the coasters. This way the flatware is available upon arrival of the appetizers and no one is left wondering. Get ready I am coming this week and I only ask for these few things to happen with a  sincere smile.

I have had a few experiences with really ridiculously slow service at the Tacoma location, so I was wary, but we decided to give it a shot. First of all, no one greeted us for several minutes when we came in, even though one employee was at the front for a short time. We were literally about to walk out and try our luck at Olive Garden when the host walked up. We were seated almost immediately (there was a decent crowd but it is a nice big restaurant) and received attentive and friendly service for the remainder of the visit. We tried the deep dish pizza, and were not disappointed. My husband recently took a business trip to Chicago and was not impressed with the greasy cheese slabs there, so he was very happy with this lighter take. Drinks, salads and appetizers were all served quickly, and our waitress was very cheerful and even patient with the seven-year-old, who threw a couple of odd requests her way. As for the food, the pizza was great as mentioned, the roast beef dip and turkey, ham and bacon sandwich were fine, the chicken wings nice and spicy, and the mozzarella sticks were all that deep fried cheese should be. We were happy with the selection of local brews (Iron Horse Brewery Irish Death! Try it.), and the free birthday pizookie was a nice touch.

I've been to BJ's multiple times, this location as well as others and I have not had a bad experience. They have a lot of options to fit different eating habits and the food is really good for a big national chain restaurant. Not to mention great beer. During this visit it was my friend,  my 6 year old and I. Upon entry the staff was very friendly and professional. They instructed us it would be a 15 minute wait, fortunately it was less than 10.  After we were seated our waiter was quick to our table taking drink orders and offering his help.  From that point forward we were absolutely impressed by the level of service. Our waiter, wish I could remember his name to give him accolades, didn't miss a beat. He knows how big a difference the small things make in someone's experience. When I asked if they had a certain sauce, but they did not so I ordered another,  he brought out what I ordered plus what he thought I might like based on my request.  On top of that my friends dinner came out and before we had a chance to look at it he said he noticed the pita bread to have a slight burn on a small portion so he has already requested another order be made at no charge. First I've never had a waiter point out an issue prior to me,  maybe if something was requested to be left off but was not, but definitely not in relation to the quality of preparation. Then to have another order already in the process of being made to accommodated this minor issue, that is going the extra step to make your customer happy. Oh and he didn't take my friends plate that was brought out just to make her wait for the new order.   The My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kids Mac'n'Cheese is no different than what I'd buy in a box at the grocery store.

Maybe I am wrong and the pizookies do take a long time to make, but even so, there is absolutely no reason why our server completely ignored us for nearly an hour, and only came by our table to drop drinks off. I had to stop her at one point and ask how much longer it was going to be since my six-year-old was getting restless. She came back with our food within minutes, and still failed to apologize.

Mentioned it to the waitress who was quite nice. She said she would talk to a manager to see if anything could be done and never heard anything nor did the arctic draft from the AC stop or even slow down.  *About 45 minutes into waiting for our food my children boy age 7 in shorts and T-shirt and girl 9 wearing a lite summer dress were both complaining they were freezing. My wife and I were also both cold by now. It is important to note I DO NOT as a rule ever get cold.  *Finally about an hour after ordering, our food showed up kids first followed by my wife and I about 1 minute later.  *My wife ordered the Mediteranian Chicken Taco which she said was very good. This may be the best bang for your buck here. * I at the waitress' recommendation ordered the Ribs which I chose to pair  with the White Cheddar Mashed potatoes and the Clam Chowder. The clam chowder never came until my meal was delivered. We asked about it and it was promptly brought out and was told that This is unacceptable I will take care of it by someone whom I thought may have been a manager.

They were on the edge of being dry definitely not the moistness one would expect from good ribs. These ribs were okay tasting nothing special. Overall my meal was just short of completely disappointing.  It took way too long to get a box for what was left of our food and the check.  I definitely think they were understaffed. One of the servers dropped a plate on the floor near us, sauce was splattered everywhere when we left about 20 minutes later it still had not been cleaned up.

The kids were rather excited and rambunctious so we patiently waited outside so as not to bother other patrons also waiting inside. After approximately a half hour we inquired how much longer our wait would be and were told by two very pleasant and empathetic hostesses that they were working on it. After another 15 minutes, with the little ones being very hungry, we again inquired how long our wait might be. We were told that some patrons were occupying their table for 2 hours but we were first on the wait list. AFTER AN HOUR WAIT, we were finally called for a table! We were seated in the back half of the restaurant and were surprised to see that about 80% of this area had open tables!!! Our server, Tony, was effusively pleasant and took our drink orders. We asked him if we could speak to the manager. The manager on duty came to our table and we proceeded to tell him how long we had waited and asked why we hadn't been seated much earlier in the back area that had so many tables open. He went on to explain that, being Sunday night, they usually don't expect to be as busy as they were and suggested a shortage of waitstaff to cover the whole restaurant. He also offered to buy us all desert as compensation. The service we received from Tony was abysmal! My son-in-law ordered a burger without tomatoes. It arrived with them! My Grandson asked for applesauce with his meal and instead got fries! My wife ordered a side of fries and never received them! We were NEVER asked if we needed drink refills and had to ask for them after the meal was over! The bills were split and items were mixed up on the bills! Even the gratis deserts were screwed up with two of them denied because they were out of Peanut Butter Pazookies. And my Grandson received his sundae without the cherry on top! Everyone, especially a 6 year old knows that the cherry is what makes the sundae!!! The service was so painfully, frustratingly slow that we didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 9:30!! This was way past the baby's intended bed time and she actually ended up falling asleep in her high chair! While the manager tried to compensate us for the extremely long wait time for a table, this was before insult was added to injury with the incredibly slow service!

There were two adults and 3 children aged 2 months, 1, and 3. Our order was taken at 1:15pm but we didn't get our food until after 2pm. We ordered a French dip sandwich with no onions, a ahi tuna salad, a kids chicken fingers and a side of mashed potatoes for the 1 year old. First of all, I asked for a cup of warm water to heat up a bottle. This alone took 30 minutes. Then when our food finally arrived over an hour later, there were onions on the French dip, the fries were cold, and we never even received the mashed potatoes. We had ordered two iced teas to drink and when we asked for a refill (yes we had to ask), it took the waitress 10 minutes and she only refilled one of the iced teas and left the second one empty! Oh and we had waited so long that the iced tea no longer had ice and she filled it with warm tea. We had to ask for the manager not once but twice. When he came over to our table (after a good 20 minutes), he just made excuses for why our food took so long, was wrong, and cold. He said due to their being short staffed and a larger party that came in we had bad customer service. Yeah we didn't want excuses. Then he comped the French dip and did nothing else for our extremely horrible experience. Being paying customers we don't care about what went wrong. We just care that we had such a horrible lunch. We spent over two hours at a restaurant to get a salad and a sandwich. Ridiculous! Then when we were trying to leave we had to ask for our bill. It was never brought to us so we ended up having to drag 3 screaming kids who were very unhappy up to the front to pay our bill.

174,R T.,"Pullman, WA",0,41,,1.0,2016-02-21,"02/20/2016 Long wait, poor service, manager that doesn't have a clue. Went to BJ's for dinner with three others. Arrived just after 7:00, waited 35 minutes to get a table.  Server took order for waters and two drinks and disappeared.  Other tables around us getting their beverages.  Server eventually showed up with drinks and took our food order - simple calamari and flatbread appetizer, salad and pizza entrée. After 30 minutes server came by and apologized they were having issues in kitchen then disappeared again. Food finally arrived. Calamari was tasteless gooey breaded item and the dipping sauces bland. I did not eat the mess and told the server how bad the dish was.  Server did not offer to replace with alternate.  Other food ok but nothing worth the price.  Server was inattentive during the 2.5 hours we spent but at one weird point sat down at the table as if she were a friend of ours??? Asked the server to remove the calamari from the bill as it was inedible.  One dessert dish ordered that took 20 minutes to arrive - after I got up and asked a couple of servers and the host desk why it was taking so long.  When leaving I asked for the manager. I spoke with him for a few minutes but he just argued they were busy and had kitchen issues so basically they don't have a clue how to handle these situations and if it happens again customers will just have to suffer through poor service, long waits and uncaring staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=100,2.56,2.99,2.99,2.116,2.8180000000000005

Also Tacoma is where we found out the gender of our baby by the server putting a pink Splenda packet under our pazooki. Anyways! Enough about me. This visit was great except for the fact that they put dressing on my salad when I asked them not to. However I was so hungry I just ate it and the extra dressing on the side they gave me went unused. *shrug You lost a star guys but to be fair I only give 5* out to an establishment that went above and beyond.

76,Moda L.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,2.0,2016-03-12,"This was our second and will be the last dining experience here.  Tonight we had a party of 18.  Being a Saturday it was busy.  From the time we began to place food orders to the arrival of all 18 meals was around 45 min.  Focusing only on our family, the food was average. One order was the $12.95 portabello mushroom burger that was cooked nicely done.  Fries were average at best.  The Garlic Chicken Pesto pizza $15.75 was a bit smaller than expected.  For some unknown reason, the shape resembled an eye or a fish rather than round or square. Some of the edges were burnt to a crisp. Flavor was good yet seemed to be lacking the main and therefore the reason it was ordered...Garlic. The garlic flavor was weak, undetectable. Another order was to be gluten and dairy free including sauces, meats, toppings, etc. Desiring to eat something other than salad this was ordered piecemeal. This special request was repeated to the server at least twice, and she acknowledged each time. Beforehand research was done reading the tiny online food sensitivity menu. It would have been useful to be offered a separate menu for food sensitivities during ordering, yet that was not an option we were told about.  So with limited options from the main menu, a separate plate was prepared with a half cup broccoli, and two or three deli thin slices of ham.  Too bad the ham was very salty and not eaten.  Then on this order the kitchen goofed and added someone else's asparagus with butter (dairy) onto the no gluten no dairy plate.  The server returned the order to the kitchen returning the plate with removed spears leaving a noticeable gap between the broccoli and deli ham.   We did not expect the lemonade to be so sugary, so requested extra water.  The waters did take some time to get refilled, and my original lemon had been squeezed dry three glasses ago. Didn't want to make a stink about it as our busy server Hailey M. had her hands full.  Overall our party had a nice time chatting.  Yet the overall visit left a bit to be desired.  Next year's yearly gathering will be held elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=60,2.4,2.89,2.89,2.3760000000000003,2.694

40,Carol H.,"Puyallup, WA",9,124,399.0,4.0,2016-04-09,"I'm updating my review since our last visit last summer wasn't up to par yet I failed to review it . That visit the service was the worst we'd had at any restaurant in years and the entree salad barely had anything but the greens plus got order mixed up when we finally did get served, ugh. So I'm happy to say yesterdays visit was a pleasant experience given it was celebrating my birthday. We ate in the enclosed outside area which was very nice on a beautiful day. We had two servers, obviously one in training and both were professional. We started off with an app. we'd never had before, the hot spinach dip w/ tortilla chips....really good! Chips hot and fresh and the dip was cheesy goodness with enough art/ spinach. Appetizers are a bit pricey, at 11.50 you'd think it might have shrimp or crab. It was a Friday at 2:00 so we were able to also choose from the weekday lunch specials. I had no clue they offer an UNLIMITED soup/salad for 8.99!! The cool thing is it's not just one type of salad and one or two soups....it's all 3 salads (caprese, ceasar, and blue ch. wedge) and for soups it's 5 offerings (clam chowder, cheesy broccoli, tomato bisque. Ale chili, and chicken tortilla). On the weekends you can do a soup/salad combo at the same price but it's one bowl/one salad not unlimited. It's fun to be able to be able to do a couple different combos before your stuffed to the gills! My first round was caprese' salad (fresh mozz/tomato with diced red on., basil w/balsamic glaze) with broc/cheese soup. Both were really good, although my personal preference is the sliced larger mozz. over the tiny mozz. balls. The broc/cheese soup was super cheesy, like velveta soup with broccoli but I'm not complaining, lol good but really rich! I was getting full on my first round and it certainly wasn't due to the small light salad. My daughter had the chicken strips/fries and they let her order a side ceasar for only 1.50 more and it was a nice size! She was very happy with everything. My hubby had the california chicken club and it was impressive, nice amount of all the fixing's...bacon, avocado, tomato and of course chicken with a garlic aoli he enjoyed. His only mild complaint was the tarter sauce being on the sweet side. I went on to order a second round of soup/salad. This time I did the clam chowder and ceasar. I noticed this time the soup came in a cup instead of a bowl  but that was fine as I knew I wouldn't likely finish even the cup. I must say it wasn't the superb chowder we've had in the past, the problem being the diced potatoes were still firm, eekkkk, disappointing only ate half. My ceasar for some reason was saturated in dressing. Now I like dressing to be on the generous side but this was so heavy the romaine was getting soggy, just way too much so much got left behind. I must mention the drinks. I started with a Ultimate Long Island Ice tea hoping for a little boozy kick, wrong..good but not potent like a good one should be. My daughter changed off between the flavored ice teas and lemonades which was a great deal for 3.25 being able to get refills. My hubby had a craft beer, the new peach one which was refreshing and only 3.95 on the lunch weekday special which ends at 3:00. I had a hefeweizen for my second drink which was really good too. We were all feeling pretty darn full an hour or so later. The servers were very attentive the entire meal and brought me a small complimentary pazookie with a scoop of ice cream to top things off. I had to take it home and enjoyed it later. Those darn cookies are sooooo rich and yummy, wow. Our bill for all this came to 67 bucks, not bad at all. Overall nice experience...the couple mishaps weren't enough to put a damper on the entire lunch. Luckily my first round of soup/salad was a hit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=40,2.56,2.84,2.84,2.6719999999999997,2.728

Discover is an accepted form of payment. Tabs were easily split. BJ's reminded me of so many other sports bars/burger joints: Bob's, Boston's, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc... The decor is spacious and modern.  The beer and wine menu is extensive and takes some time to peruse. With that being said, it would be helpful if the servers gave the patrons a couple of minutes to browse the vast selections rather than hover around waiting for an order to be placed. My wife and I chose a couple of pounders of Oasis Amber for $6.25 each. A bit high-priced to me. We shared the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer for $11.25. Our server stated these egg rolls were on the spicy side, which was incorrect. Sweet chili dipping sauce does not constitute spicy. The egg rolls were packed with fresh avocado and were a bit flavorless and extremely rich. Poor choice on our end. Our server was pushy in the beginning then became very scarce once our orders were served. We actually had to request our second beers from another server.

75,Andrei M.,"Seaside, OR",0,7,,1.0,2016-12-26,"I came here with a small party of four and we were told the day staff was ""switching out"" for the night staff and that the wait time would be longer. I was given an estimated wait time of approximately 20 minutes. Somewhere around 40 minutes later we were still waiting and watching as the hostess called out for the same three parties. None of these people were even in or around the restaurant and never came to the hostess podium. (One of them was a party of 9! They could have seated a third of the people crammed into the lobby if they'd have moved on.) As more and more guests arrived the hostess continued to offer the same poorly crafted excuse that there was a staffing switch (that apparently lasts for nearly an hour) and the wait time was about 20 minutes. She still called out for the same 3 parties. This was exacerbated by the fact that the ""waiting area"" consists of two tiny benches filled with other people already waiting, so my family was forced to stand directly in front of the hostess station, near the drafty rotary door, in everybody's way. The hostess never smiled, clearly didn't want to be at work, and was short and unconcerned with our and others' wait time and inquiries. She didn't even respond to my wife's questions other than to raise her eyebrows. That said, with such little faith in the way this place treats its prospective guests, we decided we would be far better served else ware, where the business actually appreciated our patronage.  The staff at this facility during our visit seemed to be not only unprofessional, but blatantly disrespectful to their customers and showed absolutely no signs of caring or having any interest in good service. Everyone has long and/or bad days at work, but thats never been an acceptable excuse where I've worked.  What pushed me over the line and ultimately caused me to leave this blunt and painfully honest review (I'm not this hard on folks if I see they're trying) and vow never to come back to this place or recommend it again was the fact that even our children recognized how rude the portly and ill-tempered hostess was and asked why she purposefully ignored their mother, who had been very polite to the hostess and stood patiently at her podium for almost a full minute awaiting a response before I told her we were leaving. There are no excuses for that kind of behavior.  My advice is to avoid this terribly managed place at all costs. Don't subject your family to such an apathetic group of disgruntled employees. Clearly the people that work here don't want to, and at least during our visit they weren't even trying to hide that fact.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup?start=60,2.56,2.71,2.71,2.6600000000000006,2.6500000000000004

My son and I came in because we had a free appetizer coupon we wanted to use, on Sunday night around 6:15. The hosts were very friendly and brought us to a table immediately as the restraint was not very busy. The service, however, was atrocious. Our server, April, greeted us in a rude manner, she was definitely not happy to be there and it showed. We had to repeat our drink order because she said she, ""spaced out"". Then she offered the excuse that she had been there since 11:00 AM and was tired. I am a server myself and one thing you should never do is tell your guest you were spaced out when they were ordering, and that essentially you are too tired to do your job! I'm sorry you were there so long, April, but were you getting paid that whole time? Yes! So do your job or find a different line of work! We ordered our appetizer and she asked us for our dinner order at the same time. Our dinner came out before our appetizer, and we didn't have silverware on the table so I asked for some utensils, as I had spaghetti and then April went to take another tables order before giving me silverware. The food was mostly forgettable. The spaghetti was mushy and the meatballs looked underdone. My sons grilled cheese sandwich looked as if it sat in the window for 10 minutes, it was hard and wholly unappealing. 10 or 15 minutes after our food was delivered our appetizer came out, and I declined as we were both finished eating. We asked for the bill and when she brought back my card, she had charged me for another tables bill, double what I should have been charged. She then never came back and we had to get a manager to fix the overcharge. The manager was apologetic and assured me the charge had been reversed and charged my card the correct amount. He told me to keep the free app card we had, which since our app came after the meal, I was going to do anyways.

Usually I eat the spaghetti because it is really good and I am a picky picky pasta eater, but I wanted to try something different and I was not disappointed. The fried fish rocked. The clam chowder is pretty good too. I love their fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea.  I wish we had had Nick the next time we came in. My husband felt we should sit in the bar. Never again. Soup without crackers, fish and chips no ketchup. Iced tea no ice. We rarely saw the server I was so disappointed in her. Service for me is one of my highest expectations. So when it is not up to par I am very sad. The food was wonderful as usual though.  We will continue to dine here and I highly recommend this restaurant.  I have two suggestions make sure that Ice tea has lots of ice and the booths need to be made wider. I am a fat girl and could not sit in a booth, not enough room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup,3.24,2.7,2.7,,2.9160000000000004

28,Ana G.,"Puyallup, WA",0,5,1.0,3.0,2017-11-27,"Bj's makes my favorite salad anywhere: roasted Brussels sprout and kale salad with blackened salmon. Absolutely delicious. The salmon is always excellent and not overdone. Unfortunately, we don't eat here that often because the service is so inconsistent. Tonight, they forgot our salad dressing and service was slow. We might have had a second round of drinks but we were never asked. Too bad for a restaurant with decent food in Puyallup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup,3.16,2.72,2.72,,2.8960000000000004
32,Madison F.,"Puyallup, WA",0,12,,1.0,2017-12-17,"Literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant! The only good thing about it was our poor waitress who kept having to deal with the kitchen's screw ups on our orders. We all ordered our food and a manager came out to tell us that they were missing a prep cook that day and couldn't put guacamole on the four of us's food who ordered something with it. Three of my friends asked for just avocado slices instead and I decided to order something else (odd that they couldn't just make some guacamole real quick, I've worked in lots of restaurants and know it's super simple to make). Our food is brought out and my tacos has cheese on them. The waitress apologized and said that there was a new cook working and that cheese isn't suppose to be on the shrimp tacos and took my food back. One of my friends was eating his soup and found a huge chunk of plastic in it. Instead of comping his meal, they offered him a free dessert. Finally, once all my friends were done eating, my fixed food came out. So I awkwardly got to eat my food while the rest of my friends were already done. Not only that, but my food was freezing cold and absolutely disgusting but I was so hungry and didn't want to wait for them to recook my food for a third time. The waitress overheard me telling one of my friends at the table that my food was gross and a manager came over an apologized for the food and offered me a dessert(I said no, they don't have anything dairy free). We got our checks but they were completely messed up. My friend never got her check and neither did I, but they still made my other friend who found plastic in his soup pay for his meal. I don't think any review could ever truly bring light to how much of a s*** show this dining experience was, but when we all left we agreed to never come back.  To our poor waitress: you were amazing!! She was the only great thing about this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup,3.04,2.72,2.72,,2.8480000000000003

25,Josh J.,"Spanaway, WA",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-23,"I'm torn. The staff was great... except for the chef who prepared my rib eye. Quite possibly the worst rib eye I've ever had. Which is very disappointing when you pay for quality, and get trash. The Mrs. got the sirloin, and it was also sub par. The waitress was very nice, but even though i told her we were there celebrating my wife's birthday, and that we came there strictly for the free birthday Pizookie, she forgot. Granted it was rather busy, and her section had most of the large tables. White cheddar mash, and my daughter's French fries were very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup,3.08,2.74,2.74,,2.8760000000000003
21,Leah G.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-12-31,"So disappointing! It's happy hour and they ran out of their happy hour wine!  They can't (won't) make a substitution because the cabernet sauvignon they DO have is considered their ""high end"" wine and is ""too expensive"" to substitute. Now -- to be real -- these are both wines that you can get at any grocery store for between $8-$12, so it's not REALLY a high end wine but whatever.  So poor planning on the part of whoever does their ordering to run out if something so basic as their house red. Add to this, the manager pinching pennies at the expense of customer satisfaction and subsequently earning his restaurant this unfavorable yelp review. Bad idea to make the customer pay for someone's incompetence, mistake, or whatever it was that caused them to run out of their house red wine.  Incidentally, BJ's has all wines half price on Tuesdays so it's a little ironic that the manager considers it too expensive to substitute today but will be selling it at half price in two days from now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-puyallup,2.96,2.74,2.74,,2.8280000000000003
