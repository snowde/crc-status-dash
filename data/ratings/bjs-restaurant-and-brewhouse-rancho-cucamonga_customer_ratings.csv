564,Yatin P.,"Gurnee, IL",25,125,28.0,2.0,2012-04-04,"First, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of BJ's Restaurant's. The food is quite good and how can you not love Pizookie? Bring a group of friends with you and you'll surely have a good time here.  That being said, i have been to this particular restaurant at few times now for happy hour over the last year and many more times for regular lunch/dinner and found that the food served at the bar late night is just off. I've come here for lunch and dinner with friends and sat in the regular dining area and had no issues with the food quality at all. The servers were great, food was excellent and everyone had a good time.  Jump forward to last week when me and my buddies came for happy hour (after 10pm) for a 3rd time this year and got to talking. We realized that during happy hour, the food is terrible, and the only good service is that of the host who seats you. The Avocado Eggrolls SUCK during happy hour. Usually they taste great, for some reason the 3 times we ordered them during happy hour - they were terrible every time. They were so poorly prepared and cooked once that one of my buddies complained and got the charge for it removed by the manager. The burgers are the same deal, not cooked right during happy hour it seems and they always seem to forget things inside the burger - be it grilled onions, sauce, etc. We have to keep asking for them, which brings me to my next gripe - the service. The service is fine when you order, but when a problem comes up they are quick to reflect it in their personality. Snappy remarks and quick answers is what usually happens. That kind of attitude will get you nowhere - and for that reason my friends have refused to leave any sort of tip 2 of the last 3 times we came for happy hour. Suddenly they stop coming around to fill drinks every so often and just let you sit the rest of the night so they don't have to deal with you. Sucks, because I love coming to BJ's with friends....but now I probably can't even bring up the idea of going to BJ's for happy hour unless we are all piling in my car and driving to the Chino or Moreno Valley locations.  I'm just not sure about this particular location at all. I can go to any other BJ's (as i have) and get the same great food and service i'd expect from this place. But come to this Ontario location during happy hour and they seem to not care anymore. It's not like we come rolling in right before closing either, we get in about a half hour or so after happy hour starts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=620,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0160000000000005,3.1200000000000006

643,Steve P.,"New York, NY",3,71,2.0,2.0,2012-05-16,"I went to dinner at BJ's in March with a colleague.  Normally, a dinner I ate two months ago wouldn't stick out in my mind, but this one does and deserves a review.  Okay, so we arrive without a reservation and are told it is a 15-20 minute wait.  We go to the bar, order a drink and just as we lift our glasses the vibrator goes off.  It was about five minutes and of course, you have to settle up before you can leave the bar.  I hate that.  Know your tables folks! So...we are seated and spend some time on the very large menu. Beware any restaurant that has every kind of cuisine....they are guaranteed to not excel at anything.   At any rate, our waiter comes over and asks if we want a drink order, obviously not noticing the full beverages on the table.  We were hungry so we ordered right away.  We wanted to start with some dumplings (potstickers) then I ordered the pork chops, my friend got chicken and he got soup and I got a house salad.   After about a five minute wait, his soup arrived and my salad arrived.  No sign of the dumplings.  Okay, that's cool....we ate and we were mid-swallow when what shows up?  Dumplings?  Nah, our entrees.  So it was slide over the salad plate to make room for the entree.  So, we are now eating our soup or salad and simultaneously eating our entrees when the waiter arrives to check on us.  He sees our table, heaped with copious servings and his reaction?  ""Wow, that came out fast.""  No apology, no offer to take it back, no reaction at all.  Then came the coup de grace.  ""Let me check on those potstickers.""   Needless to say, he showed up with the dumplings about five minutes later and we ended up eating the mess all at the same time.  I really have no recollection about the food.  It was typical chain fare (Applebee's, TGIF etc) so it wasn't bad, it just wasn't memorable.   Our nuclear physicist of a waiter never even attempted to make amends for the lousy service (he could've comped us the potstickers or offered dessert).  Not being the ornery types, we just let it pass.   Probably shouldn't have since our waiter is probably still inflicting his lousy brand of service on other unsuspecting customers. I did reduce the tip slightly from my standard 20%.   The decor is typical sports bar.  The atmosphere is loud.  The place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Americans are increasingly willing to accept mediocrity.  Oh well, we REALLY should have made a stink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=680,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0800000000000005,3.0000000000000004

I just ended up getting pepperoni pizza (I wanted chicken, but it cost a bit extra and I'm a budget so... no). I'm not sure if I would recommend getting a drink unless it's happy hour.

I arrived around noon and their was absolutely no wait (yay!).  Once my friend arrived, we went to the front desk and were immediately greeted. The front desk was very friendly. We ordered the calamari (a little too chewy for my taste) and the macaroni and cheese.  I'm a huge fan of their mac and cheese because it has baked bread crumbs on top.  I also loved the crushed gold fish crackers. I guess it takes me back to my childhood.  We also ordered salads - one caesar and one house salad with bleu cheese.  The house salad was very fresh and I ate every bite!

A friend and I had decided to try a few of their Oktoberfest themed menu items. We both ordered the Oktoberfest pumpkin ale. It wasn't overly hoppy and did have a nice pumpkiny finish at the end. Two thumbs up. We ordered the bratwurst sliders served on pretzel bread as an appetizer. Unfortunately it took nearly 20 minutes before we received it. Without us even saying anything about it (we were actually watching Basketball and Baseball on the big screens) a manager had stopped by and sincerely apologized for the bratwurst sliders taking so long. He further proved his sincerity by giving us the sliders free of charge. Score!  The sliders were very, very tasty. The bratwurst had a nice bit of spice and snap to it. The dijon mustard sauce served as a side was also great. But what really did it for me was the pretzel bun. I like soft pretzel bun in lieu of traditional hot dog style buns.. The entire thing was delicous. I was brave enough to order the new Brewhouse Double Deluxe Burger. It's a carnivore's dream. Two half pound angus beef patties, strips of bacon, fried onion petals, and all the other fixin's typical of a classic burger. I was only able to eat the meat, however. That's over a pound of unadulterated meat! In the end I barely finished the meat but left nearly all of the bun and nearly all of my fries. The highlight of the night was when my burger came out. As I stared in confused awe at the sheer immensity of my double bacon burger, a woman dressed in business attire (had to be in her early 40's) came up to my table and asked what I had ordered. My reaction upon reception of said burger must have intrigued her enough to actually come up to me. I told her, ""The Double Brewhouse Deluxe Burger. It has over a pound of meat. And bacon, too!""  She responded with, ""Mmm.. I love lots of meat.""

I'm not sure what the deal is with the Rancho Cucamonga location, but they could use a refresher course in guest service. We decided to have dinner at the bar, and we both ordered a beer to start. Things were off to a typical start, until another guest came by, and picked up a napkin from the floor and set it in front of me as he proceeded to sit down next to me. I turned to the man, and a conversation ensued. Me: Gross. This isn't my napkin Him: Then why is it on the floor under your chair? Me: Probably from someone else who was dining here earlier, but the point is man, why would you pick up something from the FLOOR and put it in front of my plate? He didn't respond and the dirty napkin sat on the bar for a few minutes until a bartender took it away. While I continued my meal, I could overhear the bartenders saying they ""didn't know what the big deal was"" that the napkin was on the floor, and they continued to discuss it within earshot of me.  I want to be clear, that the other guests actions had nothing to do with BJ's, and was completely out of their control, but the way BJ's handled it was out of line. They could have apologized, or at an even basic level, they should have wiped down the bar because a dirty napkin from the floor, made its way onto my dining area. Heck, if they swept up the area after the other diners, there wouldn't have been the napkin on the floor to begin with.   Instead of handling things with style and grace, BJ's took the low road. To ad insult to injury, there was a party of six or so who was sitting in a large corner booth in the bar area. Several times, the group separated over to a second adjoining table where the guests were allowed to sit on top of the tables with their buttcracks sticking out.  It wasn't once, or twice, but over the course of an hour the ""crack situation"" seemed to dominate the two tables. Who allows this in a eating establishment!? Aside from the obvious unhygenic and unappetizing factor at play, is BJ's at all concerned about the guest becoming injured by falling off or breaking the table? Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

(I figured out how to make my own, thankfully.)  EDIT: There is a BJs in Florida, Clearwater - and it's exactly the same.  A+ for consistency, BJs.  Back to the food and service though: It's pretty 'regular' food, pizzas, bar foods, beer... although they DO have a porkchop dish that is pretty good, imo. The service is 'regular' service as you might find at most chains, moderate to okay, but nothing spectacular. I'll keep visiting for the pizookie when I come back though, for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=500,3.12,3.39,3.39,2.7,3.282
510,Steve P.,"Fontana, CA",7,88,4.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"BJ's what are you thinking. So whenever I come here I get the Seared Ahi Salad.  I have probably had it 10-15 times.  So recently I get it, and the tuna was weird.  tasted bleh, and weird texture and looked funny.  I asked the waitress about it.  She was super nice, gave a quick explanation of how they changed tuna, blah blah blah.  Very shortly after manager came, gave the same explanation.  OK, fine the tuna isn't rotten, good to know.  But the fact is the tuna was changed and the new tuna sucks.  Here is my perspective, if a restaurant does not want to pay for quality ingredients, then don't put it on the menu.  Spend less time figuring out a story as to why a product sucks, and spend the time making the product not suck.  If you cant sell the product without it sucking, don't sell it.  Seems really simple to me. I do not blame the staff at the location, it was obvious to me that this a management decision, as they were all coached on how to respond.  They did respond very well, but I am not sold,  I know what raw tuna looks like, its not a rare delicacy that few have experienced.  When a company becomes blind and arrogant and will lie to me to reach their perceived goal of a bottom line, I am done with that company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=540,3.08,3.4,3.4,2.6320000000000006,3.2720000000000007

After 30 minutes, I asked her how much longer and she said that the table was getting set up for us right now. Ten minutes went by and I approached her again and this time she said that they have called in other servers to come in and that it should be another 5 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes ( now have waited a total of 50 minutes ) and I approached her again and this time she told us that part of the table saved for us was given to another group and if we didn't mind splitting our party in 2 sections!!

I mentioned that my niece picked this restaurant for her graduation celebration and he says to me "" so did everyone else"". OUCH !!

It was exactly 11:43p when we sat down.   We didn't get any recognition we even existed til about 11:57 (that was when the bus boy had just cleaned our table BTW).  He wasn't any better than the hostess.  Not a hello or nothing just came to our table looking annoyed when he was cleaning our table and left with the table still really wet.  At this point me and my fiance were debating on leaving.  Its amazing the outlook you may have of a place because of the representation by poor customer service.  The customer service was so bad I had to say something so I did to the Manager.  I let her know that the hostess seemed snooty and not very welcoming.   Look, I know were not eating at The Ritz Carlton or Morton's Steak house but still we are paying a decent amount of money.  What I think it is is that places like BJs and other places hire a lot of college kids who are stuck up and act like there better than the crummy job they have and feel a sense to bum out other people because they have to work a part time job when they have better things to do with their time.  If that's the case quit or get a job where you dont have to deal with the public.  I digress.

The girl told me that my party would have to come and check in and wait for a table. She was also a tad snappy and rude. So my party of nine has to wait an hour but a party of six can call ahead?

692,Blog S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,40,3.0,2.0,2013-11-18,"Some of the worst food ever. Yuck. I can't believe people settle for this.  Overpiced , preservative laden ""fluff"" This place is okay. I've experienced better. The service is so-so and too slow at times. Inside it looks like a the set of ""The Voice"" or something like that with this humongous sectional TV screen in the bar and a large lobby for waiting and staging.   The tables and chairs are arranged somewhat strange and in too much of a cramped manner in certain areas. The problem I have is with the food. Why are people ok with food that tastes like a chemical sewer? The preservatives and what not used in their food is far too distinctive and takes away from the enjoyment. When I go to a place like this, I don't expect the food to be nasty like that. One high note is their large selection of what they claim are home-brewed beers. Red Ale, Pale Ale, lagers..  If you're not a beer person you won't get it. But I don't drink the cheap beers. If I drink beer , it's like what they serve at this restaurant. This place is notoriously popular and crowded and there is always a wait-probably because it's right across from the Ontario Mills Mall.  Don't worry, you won't be waiting that long, (maybe 15 minutes or so) Noise level is quite loud, like some type of club or high school cafeteria, as it looks like a club inside..

On that note, if the beer were the only deciding factor they would get 5 stars. The service here is severely lacking. There is good beer all over. I can find good beer in my fridge.  We were seated a minute or 3 after they said we would be. Not a deal at all. What was a deal is that it took 20 minutes to see a server. We ordered beer and an app. We got the app before our beer. Then another 5 minutes for silverware. Yes, we got our appetizer before utensils. Or napkins. Or beer. Then the beer came. Then utensils. Then our water, that was on the same tray as our beers, only 4 minutes later. Like I said, service is lacking.  It got better from here. The food was good. I got a custom pizza with an off menu topping. I wanted green olives. The bar had them whole, but the kitchen isn't used to prepping anything during the dinner rush. It was done very well. I have nothing but praise for the pizza.  The GF had chicken pasta. She said it was fine. She didn't finish it. Rare.  Pazzookie was dry and meh. Ice cream tasted freezer burned.

321,Emily F.,"Hurst, TX",12,87,4.0,3.0,2014-01-08,"Okay, so there are going to be 2 parts to my review here.  The first part is in regards to the lousy, and I mean so lousy that we didn't leave the waiter a tip (only the 2nd time we've ever done that) service that my husband and I received when we took our family out for dinner to the RC location. First off, my husband had a few questions about the beers and our waiter told him that he wasn't even 21 yet and had never tasted any of the beers and didn't know anything about them or the prices, etc. Uhhh...okay....kinda pointless to hire a kid to sell and boost sales of beer that he can't even drink and know anything about! It's like asking a drunk to be a bartender, totally stupid.  My husband ordered a beer sampler, which the waiter mixed up (we figured it out ourselves) and took our order. The only redeeming thing that he did was change out our daughter's drink when she didn't like the first one and he did it promptly. He never delivered our food (someone else did) and it came in 2 waves: our children got their food first and then ours came almost 10 minutes later and when it arrived it was lukewarm and my burger didn't have any sauce or any lettuce/onion/tomato on it. The kid/waiter came by real quick and my hubs ordered a pint to go with his pizza, because, you know, we were at a PIZZA AND BREWERY joint.  The kid never came by again. No refills, no checking on us, no condiments as promised and no beer. What we did see the waiter doing was spending all of his time at one specific table. My husband was PISSED and I can say that he doesn't get pissed too easily; it takes some doing. We tried to flag the kid down and get his attention several times but he zoomed right past us until he finally arrived 30 minutes later and asked how everything was and my husband asked where his beer was. The kid straight up told us, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it, I'll take it off the bill"" and my husband replied that it shouldn't have been on the bill in the first place because he never freaking got it. I told the kid to just give us the bill and when he did he just stood there and my husband basically told him to beat it while he looked it over.  After we got home I called and spoke to the manager on duty, Mike, and explained how dissatisfied and upset we were about spending $50 for such bad service and he was very nice and accommodating and told me that he was going to pass my info along to marketing and that they would be calling me and it would be taken care of. Well, guess what??? They never called! Big surprise there.  On to the second part of my review: I called and spoke to a different manager, Jennifer, and explained the situation to her. I was fully expecting to be passed along again like the first time but she offered to take care of the situation right then for me; she was courteous and personable and very, very nice. I told her that I would be VERY appreciative if she could somehow remedy the situation, given that the hubs and I don't go out that often and wasting $50 is a big deal to us as we aren't big spenders. She told me that she would be sending me $50 in gift cards and hoped that the incident didn't deter us from visiting the restaurant in the future. Guess what came in the mail today? That's right- $50 in gift cards.  My faith in the customer service field has been restored because of Jennifer.  Just another example that if you want to get something DONE you need to speak to a female, because, as we all know, chicks will get shit done. Yeah, I said that, too, whatcha gonna do about it? So, first review gets 1 star and the second review gets 5 stars. Add them up and average them out and you get the 3 stars. Will we go back? Of course. Do I hope Jennifer gets a raise? Definitely, because she deserves it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=420,2.92,3.18,3.18,3.0840000000000005,3.0760000000000005

I was hungry so i continued to eat it. Plus no servers were around to say anything to.

There was a lot of good options on the menu but after looking at other people's deep dish pizza I decided that's what I wanted. They had mini deep dish pizzas that were 6 inch and 4 slices.

Split checks, not enough cash, and paying extra for those who didn't even bother to calculate tax and tip. Well those days are certainly over if you go to BJs! They have certainly upped their game and revolutionalized  Their mobile pay app is amazing! For those of you that live through Apps, this is one you won't want to miss out on. Their promo right now is $5 off $20 purchase with use of the app.  Order in before. Food ready by the time you sit down. Then just leave because your bill is already paid for. How extravagant is that?!  Ah, their food is still delicious and large in portion as always. We ordered stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, stuffed baked potatoes, chicken Alfredo pasta, soup and salad, and design your own large pizza! And of course, can't forget pizookies and beer! On point! Each bite of the pizza was just bursting with flavor and just enough crisp. Pizookies still stand for the best here as it was first introduced to me 10 years ago.

222,Jack S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,291,159.0,3.0,2014-08-22,"Not worth the wait to dine in, but the food is good to-go, even though the service is pretty lacking for both options.  I have conflicted feelings about this BJs, but I think that they fall short of what they  are trying to achieve. Forget about getting in here in a reasonable amount of time on a Friday or Saturday. These days, we only get take out because the wait is unrealistic for the quality of the food. Like a lot of places they don't take a reservation (unless you are a party of 10 or more) and typical wait times on a Friday or Saturday night get into an hour plus. I wish they would offer a certain amount of reservable spaces for those who plan in advance, or are trying to meet up with people and don't want to waste their whole night just sitting around waiting for a table.  The reason that they rank 3 stars with me is because of the food. We love the avocado egg rolls (sometimes all I do is get an order of them to go) and the ""deep dish"" pizza here is pretty good. I use quotes around ""deep dish"" because if you're never seen their pizzas, they are really pan pizza with a typical pizza crust. The beer is pretty good but this is a corporate large operation brewing, not artisanal small batch brewing like they might want you to think from the visible tanks (they don't actually brew at this location, which is why no growler fills are allowed).  The wait staff in general rates just ""meh"". It is the norm to have to ask for things like silverware, water refills, etc. We have dined in at least a dozen times before we switched to purely take out, and never had a server who gave anything above the minimum effort. It has also been my experience at the take out counter to walk up and be ignored by 3 people standing there until the ""designated"" take out person comes out to engage you. It seems like the servers mostly use the computers there to reconcile bills for their tables, and ignore you because it's not their station. Would it have been so hard to look at me and say, ""welcome, someone will be with you in a second""? This hasn't been an isolated incident, this is the norm. I think management needs to look at what is going on at this station. We continue to go for pizza and egg rolls to-go, but unless you are here during off hours, it's not a reasonable wait to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=340,2.92,3.15,3.288,3.1800000000000006,3.058

Calamari was just OK though. There was just something lacking in the flavor of the batter.  Pizookie Trio - you can pick 3 kinds and it's about half the size of a single large pizookie.

The bar is actually quite spacious and there were big TV screens that really allowed you to watch the game quite well. The food, however, was a meh. I ordered a Cherry-Chipotle glazed baked salmon partly because it was supposed to be a lighter dish on the menu. My salmon came on a bed of couscous, spinach and asparagus, but what threw me off what how sweet the glazed was and how drench the couscous was in that sauce. It was definitely way overly sweet. Another thing that threw me off was that I think the dish was supposed to come with a side salad, but I was never offered the choice to choose the salad or any salad at all. Granted, I wasn't that hungry so I didn't bother to ask my waitress for it, but it was definitely odd that my preference for the salad wasn't asked and not a single side salad was brought out. Overall, BJ's is just an ok place to hang out and eat something. Service was just ok-slightly below average...we didn't really get a lot of attention for the table (maybe our waitress was just busy with all the Super Bowl crowd in the house).

The wait was no trouble, however the place was packed and all available space at the bar and waiting area including the benches outside were full.  Though it was very cold there were about 2 tables sitting out side. They had the fire pit going and heat lamps on. I asked the hostess if we may sit and have appetizers and cocktails out by the fire pit because we were standing outside in the cold anyway. I figured we may as well try to enjoy it. She told me no that we could not do that and we can have dinner outside but having drinks and appetizers only was not allowed. That was bummer #1  When we are seated we sat for about 7 minutes before we were greeted. When the server finally came she was short and rude. She asked if we wanted to order drinks without any suggests or general warmth. We ordered she checked ID and left. While she was standing there I inquired if they carried St. Germain; I assume she did not hear me because she did not reply. Also we ordered appetizers while she was there. 1 couple ordered wings to share, then another, when my fiancé and I ordered ours I asked for them to not have ranch drizzled on top. She asked if the buffalo was okay, I said yes. I also asked for them to be very well don't ""burn them"" as I ALWAYS say when I order wings anywhere. She then turned and looked at the other people who ordered wings already and asked if they wanted to change their order to be special. That started a banter of confusion and I'm sure if they wanted modification they would have requested them.  Our server then said she was going on break and that someone else would take over. Thankfully the new server was much more pleasant than the last.  When the wings came they where completely dry. No buffalo sauce even drizzled. And they were not even remotely well done. The skin was very pliable and squishy, not crispy as I had anticipated from a well don't wing. So that was a disappointment. Food runners dropped the food and he server was busy and I didn't want to wait for another batch. I also orders a house salad that came in a LITERAL pool of balsamic vinaigrette. I actually turned the bowl and strained it into my side plate because I was unbearable. Again it was busy and at this point I was not expecting for the new salad to be any better.  My fiancés burger was squished and the bacon on it wasn't fully cooked. In general the food was terrible. I have eaten ate BJ's many times and in different states and his was by far the worst experience I have ever had. Our first server was completely rude and ruined my mood. But the second was nice and she was the one who earned the 2 stars I gave. Otherwise there would be none.  I was a server for many years and I'm sorry the food/service was unacceptable. Even when guest don't speak up, you can interpret the mood of a table. And you are supposed to anticipate the guest needs. It felt more like we were overlooked. Perhaps it was because it was too busy, then the management needs to be on their toes pitching in. Particularly when someone orders food with modifications, you should always check to make sure they have been fulfilled as requested. Not leave a food runner to drop then food and dash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=280,3.72,3.47,3.32,2.7600000000000007,3.5700000000000003

The wings and calamari were nice and hot! When we asked for extra lemons she brought them out right away! Along with what her other tables had asked for as well! Good job multitasking Amanda!! When we got our food she came and asked if we were ok if there was anything she could get for us and of course we asked for a bunch of sauces lol which she was totally ok with! She brought everything out and we talked about a few things here n there which we thought was great!  P.S the tavern cut pizzas are a must try they are super good!! The food is so delicious! Oh and the jalapeño burger is BOMB!  Anyway so Amanda kept her word and took care of us we lost count on how many times she topped our waters off without us having to ask her which was great!!  And when we were almost done she offered dessert and we told her we were celebrating 2 birthdays and she asked whose birthdays they were we told her and she wished both the girls a happy Birthday and said she would be right back!!

It was pretty busy so it was understandable that there would be waits for our waitress to come by. She was extremely nice though, which made up for the waits.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip appetizer. The cheese is melting just perfectly! Not too cheesy and not too watery like some the spinach artichoke dip from other restaurants.  Then we had the veggie delight deep dish. This was decent. Nice and fluffy, but nothing too special about this specific deep dish. We also had the garlic chicken pesto tavern-cut pizza. This was delicious! It was perfectly crispy with the right combination of pesto sauce and tomatoes and chicken and everything else.  For dessert we got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie with vanilla ice cream. Before our waitress even knew we were there to celebrate a birthday, she told us to pretend it was one of our birthdays so we could get two complimentary pizookies. Definitely a dessert that needs to be shared because of its overwhelming sweetness.  Lastly, we had the craft root beer. If you've never had it, you MUST!

To start with the positive and the reason why this review got 2 stars, was the food came out great and the prices were the same as any other location.  Also, we were quoted a 20min wait time, we didn't wait for any longer than 5 minutes.   Now for the negative.   We already complained about the hostess, but the hostess was about to get cussed out.  We were seated at a wet table.  Now yes, of course, the table was just cleaned.  We get it.  We asked for a towel so we could dry it off.  We didn't even ask her to dry it off for us.  She told us no and gave us an attitude.  She proceeded to put the menus down as we quickly picked them back up and had water dripping on us.  We asked again for a towel.  She told us it was wet because they just cleaned it.  NO KIDDING!  GO GET A TOWEL!!!!  She said she would go get one.  There was a third attempt in the middle somewhere but I was trying to tame my boiling temper and was too distracted.  Of course, she never came back with a towel.  Half way through the meal, the water was finally gone.  We were already annoyed.   To add to our frustration, service was SLOW!!!!  I have eaten at several different BJ's locations across Orange County, LA county, and Riverside county.  When I say slow, this was arguably the slowest location I have been to.  3 simple entrees.  A house salad, gourmet 5 meat pizza and wings with sauce on the side. Some how this took well over half an hour.   Yes it was busy but there were still empty tables.  This is no excuse.  Why is it in LA with higher population density, they can pump out food easily twice as fast as this location.   In addition, we were over it, we wanted to leave.  We had to wait an easy 20min to get our check.  We were getting ready to just walk out before the waitress brought the check. We werent happy.  The only reason why I tipped is because the waitress we had apologized for her coworkers actions.   Will not be back.  There are BJ's in any direction of this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=420,3.32,3.45,3.32,2.7920000000000007,3.398

The music is so loud you can't comfortably talk across the table, and that makes it difficult to have a nice relaxed meal. All that aside, the food at the BJ's was pretty good. When my mom and I came here we started off with drinks: she had a mojito and I had a margarita. They were served in great big glasses - the same type used for water - and I gotta say that I prefer my margaritas with a little salt along the rim. Even so, both drinks were pretty good. We had fried artichoke hearts for an appetizer, which were kind of what you'd expect and pretty tasty as fried food goes. We then split the chopped chicken salad. Apparently BJ's is set up for people to do this (good thing too, since all their entrees are enormous!), so the salad came out of the kitchen already put on two plates.

Took 15 minutes to be seated, which is somewhat understandable considering it's Friday. But the host looked like he had just broken up with his boyfriend, and he never acknowledged us again. Another hostess ultimately seated us. Once seated, it took another 10 minutes for our waitress, Monica, to come by and get our drink orders.

Drinks came out close to another 10 minutes later, then we didn't see her again for another 25 minutes. When she finally did come back around to check on us, it was to see if we wanted another round of drinks. We placed another order for one more round even though we were only halfway done with the first, and asked her about our food. She said she would check on it.  When the appetizer and entrees finally did come out, different servers brought it. I know this isn't unusual for a big restaurant like BJ's, but the place wasn't exactly packed yet.  The manager on hand, Elizabeth, came by our table at the end of our meal to ask if everything went well. We informed her that Monica could have been a little more attentive to our table, but other than that the food was good. She apologized and thanked us for our feedback. We had placed a pizookie dessert order prior to leaving, but 20 more minutes of waiting for it was enough and we decided to cancel it and leave. Elizabeth was very sweet and considerate enough to run it out to us as we were about to get into the car and leave, free of charge.

Paid our bill and started to walked to a reserved area of friends in a party of about thirty. Please don't slip and fall on the greasy wood floors because the manager was to busy doing who knows what to assist with a slip and fall form.

Dinned here on Saturday night approx. 10 PM. We had a party of 20 that arrived after a Gymnastic Meet at the Convention Center near by. Was told the wait would be about 30-40 minute. They were able to seat us quicker than the estimated time which was great! We had only one server. Her name was Kayla. Drink orders took a little time, but we were okay with that since we were all socializing. Hoping our meal orders would go much better as it seemed the dinning area had cleared out and they weren't to busy at that point. We all ordered and our meals took over 30 minutes to arrive to the table. This should be blamed on the kitchen -not the server. Many of the meals were cold. I had the vegetable Penne Primavera: it wasn't even warm, could tell it sat and I was the last one served too! The green bell peppers in the pasta were undercooked  ( still very crunchy) and the pieces were so large it was not enjoyable. Many other unhappy patrons in our party. Brussels Sprouts were not cooked through: bitter and a fish and chips meal was over cooked with pieces of burned fish. Our server didn't get the staff help and support she needed for such a large party, but she did her best. NOTE: We were there for about two hours total.

383,Jess A.,"Nipomo, CA",1,5,,1.0,2016-02-24,"I usually love bjs! Good food normally friendly service but today 2/24/16 was the most disappointing service I've ever had. I took my grandma out to lunch and we picked the Rancho Cucamonga bjs, we were  seated quickly and the waitress came up after a couple minutes. She was friendly enough took our drink order then returned with the drinks and took our food order. This was at 11:29 (I checked the ticket time to see when she punched in our order) took about 20 minutes for our main course to come out. Waitress walked up right after asked how everything was and that was the last time we saw her until we got our check! At the beginning we had ordered a salad to go to take home for another family member who was working. After sitting there doing nothing for about 10 min because we had finished our food and drinks completely, the salad came out on a plate! Told the bus person it was to go and she went to fix it. At this point it's 12:15. At 12:20 when we still hadn't had our plates cleared or been offered refills nor had we been offered boxes or the check I flag down a different waitress to ask for a manager. She comes over her name is hazel and we complain about the absolute lack of service. She keeps trying to offer us drink refills which at this point we just want to leave then says she will get our boxes and check on our salad. She did not apologize at all at this point and while she did comp some of our meal she just seemed very disinterested in the issues we were having. So we get our boxes and our check and then finally after about 40 min we finally see the waitress again to collect our check and all she can say is 'sorry it's been busy' yet people who were sat about 5 min after us had already been able to leave 20 min prior. So we finally pay at 12:30 and still wait a couple more minutes for our salad. I have no idea why it took an extra 20 min to remake a salad as to go when it was their error in the first place.

The food, especially the pizza and the desserts, is good enough to spend time with friends and family. The only issue that's consistent at this location is the service. Usually it's the quoted time that's off about 15 minutes. Tonight, it was the host and server teams. Does it really take 4 people to work the host stand? While we waited for our table, the hostesses were conversing with each other way to much. More than once we saw customers not being promptly acknowledged. Even when we handed our buzzer we had to wait once we approached the stand. To be fair two were working: one was on the phone and one was fixing the menus. But the other two were talking to one another. Where's the team work? Our server was inattentive and presumptuous. One of us ordered soup. When this happens we are used to being asked if 1) if the soup will be the entree and 2) if the soup would be served on a sourdough loaf; neither happened. Further, when we asked for separate checks, the server incorrectly assumed that we wanted to take advantage of a free pizookie to celebrate ""PI day"" by saying, ""Only one free pizookie per table"". Typically, the response to this request is ""Sure"" or ""Not a problem"". In reality only one of us wanted one. Lastly, the server never asked if we enjoyed our meal nor observed that the soup was barely touched.  The PI day promotion may have put additional strain on the respective teams.

My husband and I come here often because we love the food, atmosphere, prices, and ""most"" of the staff. However, we had our first unpleasant experience about three weeks ago when a server charged our card twice. One was for someone else's tab  (I'm assuming it was a harmless mistake, although our bank said it appeared to be fraud due to the fact that our card was Visa and they charged it under Mastercard. I don't know the reasoning behind the accusation.) Anyways, after dealing with several staff and managers for three weeks to get our $49 reimbursement, I was over it and called to get the number to corporate to see if I could resolve my issue. That is when I first spoke with Hazel who asked if she could help me. I feel bad now looking back because I was irritated by past conversations with the staff and I assumed I'd have a similar experience with her. I was very wrong! Hazel was unbelievably polite and understanding and offered to refund us immediately! I did not have to contact corporate. I gave her my information and the money was refunded to my account within 24 hours. She apologized for the inconvenience and appeared very sympathetic to my situation. I wish I could do more to give a sincere and very appreciative review to Hazel, unfortunately I don't know how to do so.

He had another gal helping him but I forgot her name.  I was also very pleased with her.  Ronald allowed us to have as many separate checks as we wanted.  That really helped decrease the headache of trying to figure costs at the end.   My son had the beer battered fish n chips and I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and we shared.  We thought both dishes were delicious. The serving size was perfect and we were both satisfied. I'm pretty sure the rest of the party enjoyed their meal as well.  I saw quite a few completely cleaned up plates.    The manager came up to one of my friends and noticed that we moved all our presents to a different table.  She thought that we were asked to do that and apologized.  Actually, a very nice waitress came up to me and asked if I would like the presents closer to us.  She said the lunch crowd is coming and was afraid that the presents was too far from us. She even helped us move all the presents.  Thank you!  After lunch, our celebrant even opened up all her presents.  We never felt rushed.  Overall, the shower was a great success.  Thanks again to Ronald and the manager and all the servers that helped make our shower a success.   I have to admit, I used to come to this location numerous times before but stopped coming after we tried to celebrate my daughters graduation.  We had a party of 12 and waited for over an hour and still didn't get seated.  We ended up leaving and eating elsewhere.   I'm glad I decided to give this place another try.

138,Niyati P.,"West Los Angeles, CA",433,54,165.0,3.0,2016-03-25,"Its a franchise, so its pretty consistent throughout.  Location: This location, in particular was pretty big with ample seating indoors, at the bar, and outdoors. Surprisingly, pretty busy for a midday 3pm meal.  Food: The food is alright (very heavy throughout), its the dessert that really makes it. The Avocado Egg rolls are great for any avocado fans but it is definitely very heavy and rich which may not sit well with many. The deep-dish pizza are also more dough than toppings + cheese. 3 hours later I'm still overly full from not that big of a portion. However, that shouldn't stop anyone from getting dessert. Their infamous pizookies are great but even a bit much to split, 3 people is probably optimal. They also do half and half flavors for those who can't compromise or want to try a new flavor.  Overall: As a franchise, it has may options especially for a big group but I still like to stick to my mom and pop/independent places. Midday/Happy Hour time is best time to go unless you want to be uncomfortable full throughout the night. Like most Italian places, too heavy for dinner.

662,Devin F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",19,78,25.0,1.0,2016-03-29,"Ahhhh BJ's.... a double disappointment.  First Visit: My Wife wasn't feeling well so I wanted to take her out. We had a gift card and were in the area. I had never been, but I thought, ""why not?"" we were seated relatively quickly since just the two of us fit at a small booth meant for two. We ordered appetizers and 2 plates. We both had drinks. An hour later, no food. My wife wasn't feeling well to begin with so I had clearly chosen wrong and now she was disappointing. NEVER having walked out of a place, I asked if she wanted to leave and she IMMEDIATELY said yes. ONLY AS A COURTESY I told the hostess that I was walking out after an hour of receiving NO attention (refills) and certainly NO food. The hostess asked if she could get a manager to talk to me and (my wife already sitting outside), I tried to be brief with the manager and told her I came only because I had a gift card and that after an hour I was leaving. She offered to comp the meal and I explained I wasn't asking for anything free I just wanted to not come back. She told me she'd comp the order and box it up (it had just walked through the door, appetizers WITH entrees). After the boxing, ANOTHER manager came out and explained that the first woman I talked to was just an ASSISTANT manager. She said that my appetizers DID take too long but the Entrees were on schedule based on the time the CHECK was put in. I told her I checked in on facebook after being seated and she was welcome to see my check in time. My presumption is that our server was too busy and forgot to put in our check so it APPEARED the time was less than our actual. The NEW manager offered to comp the appetizers and take HALF off the bill. I told her I never asked for the food free in the first place and I just wanted to leave. Now she was trying to convince me to pay for it. I told her it was fine, she could have my gift card and call it even since I have NO intention of returning. At this point she comped the check and gave me the food (I still had no interest in this).  I felt that in SOME way the manager tried to get me to return to give them another chance which, unfortunately, i was stupid enough to do.  Second visit, same 2 person party: Upon arrival, the Hostess had her elbow on the desk and her hand holding her head up. NEVER making eye contact, she asked how many, and for a name. I have NEVER met a more rude hostess. shortly after, we were taken to be seated at a similar two person booth in a different location. We had to stand around for a few minutes as a server was squatting talking options with some patrons effectively blocked our (and the hostesses) ability to let us sit. When the server moved, the hostess apologized from bringing us to a DIRTY TABLE. instead of finding a clean one, we were asked to sit and told someone would be by shortly to wipe it down (keep in mind there were several 2 person booths available). After PLACING the order for two lunch plates, we waited more than thirty five minutes (which I have to assume is normal here) for food to arrive. Also, shortly AFTER food arrived, someone walked around passing out silverware and napkins realizing that they were never replaced to us and MANY other tables that were cleaned and seated already. The server recommended something new on the menu and I ordered what turned out to be the adult version of a Hot Pocket. My wife ordered a pizza. The paper stuck to the bottom of HALF the pizza that my wife bit into was complementary. The service was terrible. The check came out to less than the amount of my gift card so whatever the difference was, went to the server. BJ's is awful. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

We ordered a top sirloin with asparagus and a baked potato, the Parmesan chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes and subbed the broccoli for rice pilaf, and a kids deep dish pepperoni pizza with a strawberry lemonade. The food tasted really good, no complaints at all. The pizza was kinda small, but it's for kids. The lemonade was extremely sour though.  We ordered 2 kids pizookies (even though we only had one child). We got white chocolate macadamia nut and salted caramel. Sooooo good and extremely worth the price, $2.50 for each. The kids size is also the size they use for their mini trio but I think they put less ice cream on the kids. I believe the mini trio is $10.50, but if you have kids, it's more worth it if you get 3 kids pizookies than the trio.  Service could have been a little better.

That all changed after last night. I refuse to come back, even for the pizookie..  It started bad from the get go.. We put our name on the waiting list for a party of 4. Luckily, we were seated faster than the time quoted. We arrive at the booth and, the table and booth were dirty. So the hostess told us to wait, so she could get a rag to wipe it off with. She leaves and doesnt come back for 5 minutes. Meanwhile my boyfriend and I decided to sit, while my parents stayed standing. She comes back, wipes the booth, then the table and booth are really wet. My mom sat down and her pants ended up all wet because of it. She took her silverware out of her napkin so we could all use it to wipe down the wetness on the table top. Our server came along and she was great. Had no problems with her. Everything was also arriving in a timely manner, she was refilling our drinks anytime they started to get low. My boyfriend ordered the chicken alfredo, no broccoli. I ordered the sirloin (med rare), my dad got the deep dish pizza, and my mom also got the sirloin (med). Our food came out in a timely manner. First off, my boyfriend had broccoli in his chicken alfredo, which was no big deal, I picked it out for him. Then, I cut into my steak and it was raw. Literally, RAW. My mom cut into hers and instead of medium..it was med rare. So, steak lovers beware, they undercook their steaks, so be sure to order the temp above what you want. The waitress came over after the food runners brought us our food and I pointed out how rare my steak was. She took it back immediately to get it back on the grill and in the meantime, brought me out some fresh mashed potatoes. When she brought my steak back, I cut into it in a different spot in the middle, and it was still too raw to eat! I wouldn't even say it was rare..I can eat rare steaks.. This was completely raw. So she said she could get another steak on the grill for me and tell her manangers, so I said okay, that'd be great.. She also noticed the chicken alfredo had broccoli because I had put it on the first plate she took back, so she also asked if we had recieved broccoli in the alfredo or with the steak.. thinking maybe the food runners got the wrong plate. But, unfortunately..it came with the alfredo. The managers came over to the table, comped my steak and the alfredo. I asked them for it to go because everyone was already done eating..so happy birthday to me, I got to eat sides for my birthday dinner.. at least the broccoli cheddar soup was delicious. I also want to say that the steak I got to go was also still very raw, I had to cut it up, microwave it, and it cooked it to the right temp.. I saved half for the next morning and had it with some eggs. I was able to cook the steak to the temp I had originally wanted, MEDIUM RARE.. not raw. All of this, and not to mention, my sweet boyfriend hadn't eaten all day..but since my food wasn't coming out right, he sat there and waited and waited with me, while his food got cold. Time was up and he had to get a to-go box as well. This of course wasn't on the restaraunt, but if they had gotten it right at all, we both would have been able to enjoy a long awaited meal. He also wanted me to mention, dont get the chicken alfredo. It was basically noodles and chicken. There was an extremely small amount of alfredo sauce, if any. The noodles were some how burnt, or crisped. It's almost as if they add the noodles to the alfredo sauce in a pan and leave it there to sit. It was disgusting, but he was hungry and he still ate it when we got home.  Anyways, to top all of last night off, the rude hostess that sat us walked by our table twice with her phone out, texting! Also, after the managers came to our table, we saw them not even 5 minutes later at another table, then a different table after that! Obviously they need to figure something out if they're having that many problems. It had never been this bad the past 2 years we came here for my birthday. This was a complete 180° in the wrong direction. I also would like to point out that I had worked in a steakhouse for 4 years at one point. I was hostess, food runner and then moved up to server. The hostess and food runners at BJ's were unprofessional, uncourteous, and not how I would have ever treated any of the patrons in the restaraunt I worked at. The server we had on the other hand was excellent, she handled everything very well and we were very grateful for her service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=140,3.24,2.94,3.204,2.6920000000000006,3.0600000000000005

I called to check if they made reservations and they said no only for more than 10 which was a lie bc I later found out they did take reservations for less than 10. Then, a party of like 15 came in 30 mins after us and I asked them if they had a reservation and they said no. Sure enough, a few mins later they got called. I walked up in a fury and FINALLY got seated. That's already bad.  Next, the waitress was fine. Not much against her just took a while to bring the silverware but she was nice.

Well unfortunately for Bjs half come first and then your entree followed by another appetizer.  This is my second time having this problem. Seems to me that the server is overloaded with tables and not putting the appetizers in first. Most servers are paying careful attention to their respective customers. Once appetizers are delivered to the table, then the entree orders are placed in their p.o.s  system. Overall I can understand a mistake here and there but our server even put the incorrect table number in for us. Helpers trying to assist with our food kept trying to give our entrees to the table behind us. Sadly my visit today was a complete disappointment. I won't be coming back to this location.

Coming from management background I must say management here needs much improvement.  I went In for lunch with my mom 2 toddlers and an infant hoping lunch would be a pleasant quick meal.  WOW Was I wrong!  I came in 10 mins before 3 ordered lunch right away and it took over 30 minutes for a personal pizza for my kids and a sandwich. The server seemed apologetic but never refilled our drinks and we had no setting and never brought condiments I asked for and when the food arrived my kids pizza was cold which is fine since they are kids but the sandwich was super cold hardly any meat and it didn't have all the ingredients the menu stated. Not only had I waited so long for this but it was terrible. The server even agreed when I asked her about the sandwich, if she knew it looked bad why serve it?!  She then said she was talking to her manager and the manager was coming to our table to apologize. The manager never showed up to the table 30 minutes later we still had no re-done sandwich I had to ask again what was going in and at that point just asked for the bill. I have 3 kids desperate we have been there over an hour with only a personalize pizza.  Then Someone that looked like the chef came out said sorry for how bad the food was. He agreed how bad the presentation of the meals were and said I know you're experience was bad let's just take it as that and I will take care of the meal. That was a nice gesture but I honestly would've preferred to spent the 15 dollars with great service and food  and not leave with kids that waited over an hour for a simple lunch. Management really needs to step it up. At least some sort of communication to explain why our meal took ages and was horribly made plus why when re-doing it takes even longer. My poor kids were desperate to leave. My mom and I had to go to mcdonald and I thought I would never say this but mcdonald customer service was much better.  Our overall experience was so poor and handles beyond poorly. In my past management experience I have easily changed a customers view by taking responsibility when a problem occurs and making sure the customer knows how important they are to our business we def didn't matter to them and it's sad a place like this can't even handle a small situation like this one much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=360,2.92,3.11,3.156,1.988,3.034

I know about margaritas since i work in a restaurant industry and i know that you can make anything less sweet if requested . I said okay its fine and just ordered a skinny margarita which was waay better . 5/5  As we are waiting for the new appetizer we got our food! Wait whatt?! At this point we just wanna eat and get out . The pasta that we orded was cold and you could tell that it was sitting for a while . The pizza we ordered was dropped off but we didnt have any plates to share , 5 mins go by until our waitress comes by to check on us and we asked her for plates, she brought them .

671,Stephanie F.,"Upland, CA",10,7,,3.0,2016-10-14,Originally I intended to give this location one star due to the fact that we started off with an appetizer  which was Brussels sprouts. They came back really burnt. That was very unpleasant so we returned it and just orders a side salad with our burger. Unfortunately we waited an hour for our salad and then when the burger came out 20 minutes later it ended up being cold. Keep in mind that we where seated at 8:10 and a normal 45 minute dinner ended up turning into almost 2 hours. Which I personally think is a ridiculous amount of time. Overall I originally just wanted to give the girls at the front a heads up. But instead Evelyn took it upon herself to get the manager because she didn't want us leaving with that unpleasant feeling. Eric the manager came out and we explained the whole service food service to him and how we are regulars and we went ahead and assured us that the quality of food we received was not okay and gave us a $20 gift card and a coupon for a free dessert. Overall the service was not all that great but the fact that they took it upon themselves to make it better when we didn't ask for anything in return showed that they do value the input of their customers. We will return and try again since we we normally enjoy the food and service at BJ's in Rancho,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=280,2.2,2.76,2.956,2.636,2.536

On the plus side their Tvs are big so we enjoyed the dodger game . Maybe if the food had been out in time it would've tasted better but definitely not worth the price that night,worst bday dinner ever!

Tonight at Christmas Eve we visited another BJ just because we received a $50 e-gift card. When it was time to check out, the server told us their system to verify gift cards is down, so they cannot verify the validity of it and therefore they're asking for another form of payment. I spoke to the manager on duty and his lame trained response was not helping either. I felt that if the manager on duty is aware of the issue, they should post a notice letting customers know at the entrance, or have server tell customers before ordering that the issue, so to avoid any embarrassing moments. Let's say what if all they brought is a gift card and no other form of payment? Are they going to contact the police? It's really not the customers' fault that they're not paying when they were not told of the issue. We just felt like this place is just a scam. The servers attitude was not very good either. I understand you have to work Christmas Eve and the restaurant was only half occupied at 8pm on Saturday evening. But don't take this on your customers because words do spread around and it will come back and bite you.

If you have a favorite  name brand beer ask the server and they'll  suggest a comparable in-house beer or something similar. And if you are still having trouble deciding, order their 4 or 8 beer sampler. Like they say: variety is the spice of life.   For an appetizer, a plate of their calamari  is everything  you would want. The  calimari is bite size, warm, crunchy, and just filling enough to hold you over until the pizza arrives.   As a main dish, their pizzas are something to behold like a shiney trophy on a pedestal. The pizza I  had the other night was a medium size  chicago style  pizza. It was slathered  in tomato sauce and smothered with cheese. Then it was heavily topped with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and olives. It was absolutely  delicious.   And once you are done with your pizza, I hope you have enough room for the pazooki, which is a freshly baked cookie topped with icecream.

The downfall was when we got our appetizers we ask for silverware for the whole table and the waitress said she would get it. 15 mins later no silverware so we asked again. By this time the food was almost gone and we just ate with our hands. The waitress was gone for SO LONG. We could see her walking past us helping others but didn't stop to ask if we were ready to order or if we needed new drinks. About 20 mins later we finally ordered (mind you we were beyond exhausted at this point) the salads came out and still no silverware, we asked again but no one brought any so my coworker ate her salad with her fingers and the other one didn't eat her salad until someone brought us silverware after asking 4 times. Once we ordered the food took SO long I believe we waited about 30-40 mins for our food. Everyone was extremely tired and ready to just leave.

If you do decide to do the seat yourself bar area the wait to get to order any food  is almost 30 mins. So we got seated at a small table. When the server came over to us she was short in her conversation. Came off almost annoyed that we only wanted to order drinks and appetizers and needed a few mins for our main courses. The appetizers were brought by a different person she never checked to see that we were satisfied. When she did come back we ordered our food and asked for another drink to which she seemed annoyed again. The food was served in a quick time. After eating our food and waiting 15mins we had to ask someone to find our server so we could order another drink and dessert. After that person took our order and brought it to us our original server came over to us to ask if we wanted the check or any dessert.

I do not live in the area and I have never used my card near or around Rancho Cucamonga except for the one time I used it at this restaurant.

I was charged over $250 at a Walmart less than 4 miles away from this restaurant after only using my card here. I called the store and the manager just didn't seem to care. Almost acting like I don't know what I am talking about. I told her that I have worked in a restaurant before and I have seen people get fired for fraud. She didn't apologize once, she didn't ask me for information on my visit.. I still had the receipt so I could have given her the employee name, number, table number, date, time of visit and she just didn't care to ask. Instead she says ""well did you get gas""?.. I came here for a school event in a school bus so no I did not get gas. Do not go here! Do not use your card here! Fraud is obviously happening in this restaurant and by this point who knows, management could be involved in this. What kind of manager doesn't want information on possible fraud in her restaurant?! All she says to me on the phone is well I don't know what you want me to do I can't really go around asking people, but we haven't had any problems with fraud in our restaurant. I said well obviously the team member isn't going to tell you ""oh hey, I took a persons card number today!"" I told her she is the manager and I would just take this as a warning that this might be happening to other people as well. I will be writing to corporate and trying to find out more information on this.

The food took a little long but the quality of my Chicken Alfredo was worth the wait. Would recommend this dish...  The reason I give a 2 star rating is because of the quality of the service.

We also had a promo for buy one entree and two drinks get an entree free. As soon as we brought it out she looked upset about it.  When it came time to pay she brought the check to our table. It was only one bill. We kindly asked her if she could split the check because we wanted to pay individually. She got upset and blamed us for the incident. She told us that we should have told her before we ordered our food. She then told us she could only split it 3 ways. So we payed like that.  I would have written a good review had she not blamed us for the whole event.

90,Jeffrey M.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-02,"Terrible customer service. The three hostess at the desk are telling groups of people different times. I have been waiting here for over an hour. I tried using  there so called  app to put my reservation down ahead of time and still ended up waiting 1 hr. Ugh.  This place is poorly ran. The managers aren't doing a good enough job to motivate and Time manage their staff. They need more support staff. Salads came out late, we had to rush to eat them prior to our meals arriving. Our server was very overwhelmed and it showed. If it wasn't for the gift card I had this place wouldn't have been my first choice. Food was ok. My steak was a tad cold. Veggies seemed rushed and undercooked. I didn't want to send food back because we had already waited along time to eat and didn't want to wait a min more. Do not come here!!!! Go to lazy dog next door the service is way better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga?start=20,3.48,3.16,3.028,,3.2880000000000007

43,Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894.0,4.0,2017-12-07,"We had a large group and when we first arrived, we saw clusters of people standing around waiting. We were pretty sure we would have an hour long wait, or more. We put our name on the list and noticed an outdoor patio area that looked mostly empty. One of the members of our group checked to see if we could get service out there. They set us up, turned on the space heaters and we were seated! Our server was fantastic. He kept everyone's order correct and was happy to separate our bills. Our water glasses were always refilled promptly. For the number of people in our group and it being a busy evening, our food came out rather quickly. I was in kind of a weird mood, so I ordered the best beginnings appetizer platter. I had hoped that some people would help me tackle the thing but everyone was shy and I was stuck with 2,200 calories to myself. The buffalo tenders were moist and carried a medium kick. The avocado egg rolls were my favorite thing on the plate and who knew they would still be good the next morning? I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel room and was happy munching on it the next day, even though I didn't have a microwave. I also ordered the golden beet and arugula salad. I was kind of disappointed, because the beets were almost nowhere to be found. That was absolutely my only nitpick of the evening. We had a wonderful dinner and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga,3.48,3.19,3.032,,3.306
54,Carlos F.,"Fontana, CA",8,40,,1.0,2017-12-15,Ordered a mini through postmates for delivery. It arive and only had about a slices worth of toppings and the rest of the pizza was big crust bubble. Usually don't have issues in the restaurant but if they aren't going to treat to go orders with the same care as in house guests then don't offer take out. Every other pizza spot in town is jusr as good and a fraction of the cost. Thanks but no thanks BJ's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga,3.36,3.15,3.016,,3.234

We told the host up front the rest were on there way and she said fine . The host said it would be a 45 min wait for table which was fine since more were on there way . However we got seated about twenty min  later myself and friend our waiter Andy was awesome . But then the host kept on coming back and fourth asking when everyone is getting there because if they were not there in ten min they were going to take our other table . Seriously, from there it just downed our spirit . So my friend ask to speak to a manager twice and then finally one came we were just advising regarding our complaint and then another one steps in I couldn't even look at her she had so much glitter on her eyes she was blinding me . I would not come here again and would recommend another restaurant.

He's been my server multiple times and always gets it right and has a great attitude whole doing it. Great personality, always ready to refresh water, drinks or any other necessities.  Never feels overbearing or like he's trying to hard just nice, consistent service.

It took another 30 minutes to get our order. Then we paid for our order with a gift card and told them to put the balance on the credit cards. Instead they charged our credit card and didn't apply the gift card at all. So we had to go in the restaurant and fix that. It took us 1 whole hour to finally get our food and everything corrected.

His name was Jerimiah and he was very warm towards our weird sense of humor.  Loved him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga,3.36,3.23,3.044,,3.282
41,Edward H.,"Rosemead, CA",0,16,37.0,2.0,2018-01-11,"HIT OR MISS?  Customer Service (at the bar): With an over-saturated market of BJ's restaurants out there, you'll have an inconsistent experience with the quality of food and service between restaurants. I work near by and usually drop in for lunch or after work and it has been interesting to say the least. I love their daily specials and happy hour prices but the service at the bar (where I always sit) lacks attentiveness to the customer. I usually have to wait around 8-10 minutes before asking what I want to drink because the bartenders are usually talking to their co-workers. I only get 30-45 minute lunches and waiting for 8 minutes to be asked what I want to drink isn't efficient use or respect of my time, nor is it great customer service. Some bartenders are better than other, I wish I knew of the name of this guy that's their on Thursdays and a blonde girl that was their on a Friday because they offered superior customer service.  Food: I love the buffalo chicken pizza but it was terrible that day. As you can see from the pictures, there was NO sauce of any kind. It was just cheese that slides off and now you're left with some buffalo flavored bread. TERRIBLE!! I had a few over dishes that were not memorable but I do want to come back Friday and try the daily special on the ribs. It looks great but taste is another thing. Overall: This place was definitely a MISS in my opinion. A few bartenders pretty much ruined the experience for me and they seem to not really care about their customers. The other bartenders whom I can't recall their names seem alright in my book. The Buffalo chicken pizza was my favorite goto dish their and they just ruined it! Drink prices are average but happy hour is usually the best time to go to a BJ's. The one in West Covina and has way better service and quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-cucamonga,3.24,3.21,3.032,,3.222
