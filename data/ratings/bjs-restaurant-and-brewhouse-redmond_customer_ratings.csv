141,Arturo V.,"Redmond, WA",141,23,21.0,5.0,2013-05-02,"My wife and I just came back from our first visit to BJ's . . . this was a mock service with a pre-defined menu.  We brought our five-year-old son, and we were promptly seated after checking-in for our reservation.  Obviously the place is brand-new, but it's obvious the decor is upscale, yet it remains quite comfortable and pleasant.  (Reminds me of the Yardhouse).   We ordered a chocolate milk for our son, and the thing was actually pretty large, and the chocolate was mixed-in by hand.  Looked delicious!  My wife and I ordered a porter and a stout (we prefer the darkest beers available) and both were excellent.  BJ's brews their own ales, and everything is distributed from their brewery in Reno.  There are nearly two dozen guest taps, and the handles told the story . . . beyond their own great brews, I saw:  Rogue Dead Guy, Iron Horse Irish Death, Guiness, and a host of other brews comprising a very impressive lineup for any beer connoisseur.  The bar is laid-out well, and the 100"" plasma with backlit liquor walls flanking it makes a great focal point for the informal area. Our appetizer was the Ahi Poke.  The Ahi was well-prepared, and the sauce was tangy, as expected.  Presentation was excellent.  Our entrees were a calzone and the Chicken Ala Fresco.  Both dishes were lighter than expected, and were packed with flavor.  The calzone crust was flaky and the marinara was tangy.  The chicken dish was fresh with a grilled chicken breast on a bed of rice pilaf . . . accompanied by zucchini, tomatoes and mushrooms.  Our son had the mini corndogs with smiley fries, and it was all very tasty! We for sure plan to return after the grand opening to try out more from the menu, but so far our impression is great!  Our server, Josiah, was very attentive and friendly.  Everyone should definitely head out to try BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=160,2.164,2.164,2.164,2.164,2.1640000000000006

Our server decided that it was not a good day to wash her hair or make sure her nail polish was not chipped(and that a different color for each nail was a good idea) on opening day. That is a clear indication of how much the servers care about the appearance of the restaurant and themselves(and customers). You want to charge that much?

287,Karen K.,"Issaquah, WA",11,25,1.0,1.0,2013-05-07,"Okay I understand that they just opened but if you are doing the lunch crowd food needs to be ordered and out to the table in 10 to 15 minutes not 35 minutes to have the waiter give us excuses as to why it is still not there.  First the computer is down then some staff person got sick.  Never mind you have double staff running around and tons of people working.  If one missing staffer puts you that far behind then you need to rethink your staffing.  Finally my food arrived but not my wife's who ordered food that took much less cooking then mine.  I instructed them to box our food and bring our bill that we needed to get back to work NOW.  The waiter takes my plate.  We wait another 5 minutes finally another serever comes by and we tell her we need to leave but no food no bill yet.  She brings our bill, no comp, no visit from management but we got a full bill!  Still no food we wait another 3 minutes now bring 8 minutes that my food is getting cold in the box and still no sign of wife's food.  We leave without paying or food and are not two steps away from the tble and the bus person is clearing our table.  Not until I threw a fit in the lobby did a manager finally show up offering comps which we refused because no on seems to get THAT WE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO WORK.  No idea how the food is we did not even see part of it and what I did see was way over priced.  Will not be going back anytime soon. BTW this place opened 5/6/2013 so any reviews before this are either liars or they went to the soft opening and I suggest you take those with a grain of salt as they would have been given the best service and chances are they are bias.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=320,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003
289,Tony C.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,1.0,2013-05-07,"Having to work from Redmond Town Center and needing a new place for lunch, I decided to give BJ's a try. Never heard of them, but I'm always willing to give a new place a try. And really, how hard is it to mess up a bacon cheeseburger.  Boy was I wrong. Holy smokes, this is a seriously bad burger. Like, I couldn't finish it bad. For starters, I asked for medium well, and the patty had way too much pink in the middle - medium rare at best (and that's being generous). The burger was dry like a desert with hardly any sauce or ketchup or anything on it. And it was topped off with just one tepid, wilted leaf of lettuce. I'm a burger slut and a very forgiving one at that - but forget about future visits. If I'm going to drop 10+ bucks on a burger, I'll walk the 300 feet across the parking lot to Red Robin, where they know how put one together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=320,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001
291,Paul N.,"Bothell, WA",81,239,3.0,2.0,2013-05-10,"Very disappointing. My wife's family lives in Southern California and we try to make it to BJs whenever we go to visit. So we were excited to hear they were opening up in Redmond. It was PACKED, impossible to hear the mousy little waitress over the crowd noise and the bass of whatever music they were playing. We finally got our order in and then sat and waited....and waited.....and waited. 40 minutes later our pizza came out. The pizza was merely OK.....nothing I couldn't have gotten for a fraction of the cost at MOD Pizza (Sorry...that sounds like I am not a fan of MOD....quite the contrary). For the money BJs charges for a pizza, you would expect something that blows your taste buds out of your mouth and then they slap you around from sheer awesomeness. About the only thing we didn't have to wait for was our check. And holy crap what a bill it was! 60 bucks for 2 adults and a kid! Unacceptable for sub par pizza. I think I will wait to try BJs again when I am visiting the in laws on Southern California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=320,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704
284,jason R.,"Redmond, WA",0,25,,1.0,2013-05-11,"The restaurant is visually appealing and spacious. When my wife and I arrived with our 2 year old son, we were told a 15 minute wait. Promptly at 15 minutes we were taken to a table that would not accommodate a high chair. Back to the host counter where we were promptly reseated and provided a high chair (first high chair brought was not clean, so a second one was brought).  Having lived in Chicago, my wife ordered a Chicago Pizza and I ordered the buffalo wings. The pizza was brought out in a reasonable amount of time but not accompanied by the wings - this is OK, because we had a starving baby and we asked for the pizza to be brought out as soon as it was ready. We also asked our waitress if she could bring us a roll so my son could snack on something to which she replied - no problem. My wife and son finished their pizza and shortly after a gentleman came to the table and asked if we had ordered wings to which I replied yes. He said OK and then walked away. A few minutes later, a second gentlemen, who appeared to be management, informed me there was an issue with the wings to which I replied ""I understand, you are busy"". He replied, ""it's unacceptable"" and apologized - which was very nice. He then said he would reflect this in our check.  A couple of minutes later, our waitress comes over to explain the wings were taken to the wrong table (ever notice when food is taken to the wrong table, no one ever rejects it?? :) ) I told her that the babies timer was about to go off (been at the restaurant nearly an hour) so please take the wings off. She said that was what she was going to suggest and promptly handed me my bill with the wings removed - I thought this was a little odd - like they assumed (or hoped) I would ask for the wings to be removed and had the check (full bill mind you) prepared and ready to go. I've not worked in the restaurant industry so I don't know what proper protocol is in a situation like this. In my opinion - I felt I should have been provided some options to ""make it right"" instead of removing the wings and then out the door with me - removing the wings is bare minimum in my opinion.  We never received the roll we asked for and no one every mentioned it (we were not charged for it so it is what it is). For those considering to visit this restaurant, I'd suggest holding off for at least a  few months until they get the bugs worked out. My wife said the Chicago pizza, while good, was not authentic so don't go their solely for that if you know what a true Chicago style pizza is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=320,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001
292,Whitney W.,"San Francisco, CA",28,38,,1.0,2013-05-12,This place was truly awful. Went for Mother's Day - we called ahead and were told it would be a n hour wait - arrived and had to wait an additional hour. Our appetizers took an hour to come out and when our main meals finally came everything was cold and bland. The manager came up to apologize but neglected to comp any of the meal.

If you're lugging around a large family, this is a pretty typical family restaurant with bland food and nobody batting an eyelash if your kid chucks his burger on the floor. If you're single or childless, you have no excuse going to a restaurant this bad with Matt's Oyster Lounge right across the street. EDIT: We went back a couple of months later, thinking maybe the restaurant was just experiencing growing pains when we first visited (it had only been open a month), and because a friend of mine RAVES about another one of their locations. I'll spare you a long essay, long story short: loud; awful waitstaff; long waits; inedible food (I left my pizza after a few bites); and they got our bill wrong by $20.

The appetizers came in a reasonable length of time but the main course-forget about it.The manager came and told us at one point that my husband's deep dish pizza fell of the plate in the kitchen and another one was in the making.Well it took them another hour to make one. I have no idea what went wrong in the kitchen.The place was packed and I speculate that the kitchen staff was overwhelmed.In all fairness ,after we asked about some sort of  comp (thinking that we were going to be offered one more round of drinks) our bill was drastically reduced to about 1/3 of what we would have had to pay.That made the fair quality dinner easier to digest.But we never eat that late.They even asked if we wanted dessert but we were not prepared for camping so we refused. The ""Chicago Style deep dish pizza "" has nothing to do with the real thing.My husband was very disappointed. He also had the audacity to expect a piping hot pizza but BJ is the wrong restaurant to have any expectations. Before experiencing this place I had a plan to take my parents there in a few days when they will visit from overseas.Now I think that I'll do it only if they don't behave.

418,Ty R.,"Kihei, HI",125,23,,2.0,2013-05-15,"Wow, bad. Granted, it's new...but man oh man it's not good. I've had great experiences at BJ's both in California and even at the Southcenter location. When this one opened up I was pretty stoked!  So, we went on Sunday as I was really craving pizza. I had 2 of their beers.  I had the blonde and Amber. The blonde was really good and the Amber was mediocre at best.  Unfortunately our server screwed up and it took 3 tries to bring me the amber. Our server was obviously new, but he was super nice and attentive.  Really great guy. I ordered the spicy meatball & jalapeno pizza (I'm normally a pepperoni and jalapeno guy).  It was not good.  I had two pieces in the restaurant. I took the rest home because I REALLY hate wasting food.  I'm glad my wife talked me out of ordering the bigger size of pizza.  My wife had chicken and pasta.  It was ok.  Really nothing we couldn't have made at home in about 10 minutes.  It was really unfortunate as I was looking forward to this.  We paid our $60 (jeezus) check and left.   We went across the street to Spazzo for their all day happy hour and had a great pizza over there.  We spent half the money and got the same amount of food.

I will PROUDLY and UNABASHEDLY admit that my coworkers and I came here solely for the fact that we could spend our entire lunch making cheap and innuendo-laden jokes about BJ's, but we actually ended up having a lovely time.  Shocking!  Food was quick to come out, plentiful, and just about the quality I would expect- not anything to write home about, I suppose, but satisfying and definitely a tier above something like Red Robin. The restaurant is new and understandably spotless, and WAY more aesthetically pleasing than Desert Fire could ever hope to be- love the tall ceilings, and the whole place has a pretty surprisingly nice ambiance considering.  Our waiter was an absolute sweetheart, and I'm kicking myself for not taking down the guy's name- helpful, talkative, and completely attentive to our needs. ...What can I say, everyone enjoys BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=280,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128
417,Jason A.,"Seattle, WA",28,127,1.0,1.0,2013-05-17,"Yes, one star.  I literally pondered whether I could move it to two stars for the past three minutes, and I can't do it. Look, I came here with low expectations.  This is a chain restaurant in the quasi-fancy Redmond Town Center.  So yeah, I'm expecting pre-formed frozen burger patties and such.  They still managed to set the bar even lower. I went with a group of 6 during what was apparently their first or second week.  The wait was terrible and their repeated and revised estimates were not even close on the wait time.  Ok fine, they're busy, no problem. When seated, we didn't see anyone for over 10 minutes.  Strange, but whatever. Our server was a little strange and just kept parroting lines that I guess he was forced to memorize.  ""Can I get you some nachos to start the evening?""  ""Well, I really need some water right now""  ""Ok, so is that a 'no' on nachos?  Because you might want to start your evening with nachos!"" One in our party ordered a german beer on the menu.  The server was literally mystified.  Even after handing over the menu and pointing to the exact beer, the server just stared blankly.  10 minutes later, he came back and asked what beer it was.  Then another server came by and asked.  I don't even know what to say. The food, when it did arrive, was predictably terrible.  Yes, I realize that if I were a starving child in Africa, I'm sure it would be fine.  But I also wouldn't be using the internet to write reviews.  The point is, it was terrible. Despite this 3-hour ordeal, there was never once an apology, just the bill casually dropped at the edge of the table.  I've been to restaurants that have opening challenges and they either give you something for next time (gift card or whatever) or, the smarter route, just comp most or all of your meal.  Even a free dessert or something goes a long way to soothe people's resentment. Unredeemably terrible.  I never thought Red Robin would outclass a place in both food and service, but I think we have a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=240,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

There wasn't one thing, save putting water on the table, that was right. First, you gotta cut the damn scripts. No...I don't want the card. No...I don't want whatever appetizer you are pushing. Staff should spend more time familiarizing themselves with the bar menu so they aren't totally stumped.  Speaking of the beer, this was the first wrong - the beer came out after the appetizer...and it was wrong. There was a lame excuse made that the beer system wasn't working...then the staff didn't know how to pour beer after I casually glanced at all the other tables that had their drinks. They brought the wrong beers entirely and the had clearly had been sitting around a long time. After about 2 bites of our appetizer, the mains came out. There was no room at the table so we had to scrape and stack our own plates (rookie move) to fit everything. No check backs either so the requested extra butter/sour cream was brought after my potato was cold.  So I guess your standard loud, churn & burn chain restaurant has come to town.

I opted for the grilled California chicken sandwich while my wife got the sliders. Everyone was moving quick (although we never felt rushed) and our food was out before we finished our first round of drinks. Everything was very good, try the wedge cut fries over thin; we really wanted to try the pizookie for dessert but were both stuffed so we will save it for next time.

I seated myself in the bar and was waited on Immediately.  He explained the beer selection, the menu and all the specials, like Happy Hour, Drinks, Special Cocktails and that all Day on Tuesdays was half off wine.  He recommended a few beers and I chose a nice one.   We had an appetizer which came quickly, was hot and was very delicious.  The meals are big, and so far very tasty!  I asked for my meal to be a bit specialized, no mayo, my friend asked for dressing on the side.. NO problem.  They were happy to accommodate.  The prices are decent, the menu big, the portions big and since it was my first time ever hearing of this restaurant and eating there... I give it 4 stars because everything about that one lunch was perfect.    I see a lot of people are giving it a bad review but my experience really was quite nice.

When we arrived around dinner hour it was packed and we waited about 20 minutes. No problem. Then we were called to be seated, about halfway in the dining room the hostess looks around and seems confused. She told us to wait there and left. We stood awkwardly in the middle of the room with our 12 month old infant for a few minutes. Luckily we were seated and not sent back to the front. As we sat I noticed a staff member staring at us while we were chatting. I wanted to ask him what was up but I figured he might be our waiter. Sure enough when we stopped talking he gave us our menus. He asked for our drink order and suggested we order appetizers as the kitchen was backed up. The avocado egg rolls are delicious! Best thing we ate.  Anyway, throughout the night our waiter told us how he was so busy he hadn't had a drink of water his whole shift. He seemed extremely overwhelmed and we felt bad for him. He also mentioned that the kitchen was a ""sh*t show"" literally his words. Very unprofessional but we let it go. Although we did have our small child there but I guess he forgot. Ha. Our salads were good but everything else was utterly disgusting The minestrone soup was more like a chili, thick and way too salty. It also tasted like there was meat in it. The veggie burger my husband ordered was bland and gross, it literally had no sauce and yet the bun was soaked through . The fries were so soggy. You know how you put old fries in the microwave?

We waited over an hour and ten minutes to be seated (after being told 45 minutes) and then were treated poorly by the hostesses. We were sat in a booth that was not clean and still had the last customer's check there. We ordered food....3 of our entrees came (well partially as my brother's sandwich arrived without fries), the fourth one did not. My mother had to ask the waitress three times for her soup and salad. When she finally received her soup (a solid 20 minutes after the rest of us received our entrees), she was not given a spoon. Then she asked for one. 10 minutes later still no spoon. My father even attempted to get up and locate a spoon. When the waitress finally returned to our table (after knowingly leaving hot soup on a table without a spoon, she continued to take orders etc...), she snidely informed us that no spoons were available as they were ALL in the dishwasher....riiiiight. Honestly I would never return to this place again. The food was okay, but the service was so poor. I don't enjoy being treated like dirt when I go out to eat.  Yes we said something to the manager...

Definitely service is slow. we were hungry... at least the food was good. the only thing bad was the soup was cold. How can you drink cold soup? I had to ask them to reheat it. Now I wonder what canned food came out of the kitchen. The third time we visited, again, the food took awhile to come out. The calamari was good, except the dippings they accompanied it with did not compliment the dish. I suggest they use the tamarind sauce on the Avocado rolls and eliminate the red sauce and exchange that with the tamarind. That would be a better dish. I ordered Salmon and asked for a side of miso sauce since I wanted to taste it. That was a mistake. The sauce had no taste at all. It was pretty funny. My husband asked for ketchup, and the guy never came back with it. Had to ask another server for it. the place is definitely fun clean and comfy... food is somewhat good.

Service: We were seated relatively quickly, but there was a slight mixup where we were stranded in the middle of the dining room while the host tried to figure out where we were supposed to end up.  Getting our food took forever.  I sat and watched people who arrived after us get their food, finish eating, and get the bill before our food came.  The waitress made some excuse about the beans not being cooked properly, so they had to re-do them.  Apparently they forgot to take the pork off the grill while re-doing the beans.

The entire place was packed from the moment we got there, but both of the waitresses were extremely attentive and gave excellent service. Our beers were delicious and the food was pretty tasty.  My mom ordered a turkey burger which came to the table a little burnt, so she let the waitresses know, just to alert the kitchen of the quality so they could control more of what goes out. The waitresses both offered her a new burger, which she declined, as she had already eaten most of it and still found it tasted fine. Not long after, the manager came out and apologized for the burnt food and again offered her a brand new meal. We were actually pretty shocked at the level of service, because it was excellent and polite and exactly how a good restaurant should handle an issue. I believe he ended up comping the burger for her, but I'm not positive. The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5/5 is because they let the burnt food reach the table.

Lobby/hostess stand:  Too many staff members hovering.  Call-ahead seating could be a bonus, but if you aren't there at a busy time, there isn't anyone else in the lobby, and empty tables are plentiful, their check-in process is overkill and completely unnecessary.  Quit asking us irrelevant questions and just seat us, already!

297,Erika J.,"Fairfax, VA",152,2,,1.0,2013-07-24,"In short: After 45 minutes of waiting, our food came out COLD. Strongly advise not going here. If you'd like more horrendous details, continue reading the story. I was in Redmond for a training, and a group of five of us went over to BJ's for lunch. We got there around 12:15, thinking we would be done in 45 minutes. We gave our orders, and before we knew it it was 12:45 and our food had still not come out. We notified our waiter that we needed our food to be put in to-go boxes and the checks brought out immediately. He was apologetic, and sent the manager over to us, who also apologized; she gave excuses about a large party, and explained to us that the chicken tacos were all that were left to cook, and that she would take off the appetizer from the bill - except we didn't order an appetizer. When the check came we thought we'd see something come off, but the manager didn't take anything off - sneaky much? I then notified the waiter that the manager did not take anything off our bill. 10 minutes later, our food came out and our check went down by $20. We thought that was acceptable considering how long we had to wait, and the fact that we would now have to eat during our training. We got to our training 5 minutes late. When we got back to our office, we opened the food and there were no utensils for the salads we ordered, salads which had no dressing on them. No napkins. And the food was COLD; my flat bread was SOGGY. Why was the food cold and soggy if it took 45 MINUTES to get to us?? Likely because it was just SITTING there until someone got around to cooking chicken for the tacos - something you wouldn't think would take that long. I wouldn't have written this review based on my experience in the first paragraph, but cold food is COMPLETELY unacceptable in ANY situation, and it disgusts me that they just kept our food out for a long period of time. $20 off will never make up for the fact that our food was cold and unsatisfying. I wish there was a rating of less than 1 star for BJ's. Our training team of 30 people was considering going to BJs for a large group dinner, but we STRONGLY dismissed the suggestion. And I would also advise anyone going there for a 1hr lunch against it as well. And any group of more than 1 against it because who knows when they'll finish the whole order, and how long your food will just be sitting on a counter, getting cold and soggy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=320,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.604,2.24

First, the promptness issue: not a problem last night. Drinks and apps came after 10 minutes, entrees after another 10, the check after only a few minutes' wait. Water glasses got refilled often. Our food wasn't steaming hot, but was at least warm. Several staff members stopped by to ask how everything was, and all were pleasantly friendly. Second, the food: better than some competitors (Cheesecake Factory, Red Robin, etc.). My husband and I shared 6 appetizers/small plates (shut up, we were hungry): avocado egg rolls, chips and salsa, Thai chicken won tons, watermelon feta salad, bruschetta, spinach stuffed mushrooms. All were a hit. Our friends each got the pulled pork sandwich and something involving steak. The only complaint was for the steak, which was pronounced mostly gristle. Third, the drinks: generous and varied. My husband and I shared a beer sampler, and each beer was a 5-oz pour--the most I've seen for a sampler anywhere. And at $13 for 8 pours, the value was good. Everything else--atmosphere, decor, seating, etc.--is sleek and classy, but not stuffy.  We plan to go back to try more of the vast menu, and also to see if our next experience stacks up.

I don't blame her for being a bit confused, considering how overloaded she was.  The wings we got for $4, only had 5 pieces. That's shameful, since Applebee's gives like 10-12 pieces for $5-6 during their happy hour, and their wings are much better. These wings were just... uninspired, and bland, and the bf and I were rather disappointed by them.  The spinach and artichoke dip was quite good, but the portion was again lacking. Happy hour doesn't mean you go skimpy on everything, it just means you lower the prices on appetizers and whatnot, so that your patrons drink more!  All in all, it was $40 I'll never get back. The beer was ok, but definitely not worth it, and the kitchen shouldn't have taken 45 minutes to get our food out to us.

The menu has a million items.  That would be good if the food was good but I'll get to that part later.  First of all we never got any water up front.  Then, the drinks for our party of four were brought out by three different people.  First my daughter's apple juice.  Waited a minute or two.  Then my diet Coke and my husband's beer.  Waited a minute or two.  Then my other daughter's root beer.  Weird. Same thing happened with the food.  All the food came except my one daughter's buttered noodles and then a few minutes later those came out.  Really?  For buttered noodles? Then the food was just bad and over priced.  Daughter #1 had mac and cheese.  It was obviously Kraft.  No biggie as I have seen other restaurants do that.   BUT it was lumpy, dry looking and according to my 9 year old, ""tasteless"".  She didn't even eat half of it and trust me, that kid can put it away. Then my $10 salad was TINY.  Also it was coated in dressing and the lettuce was soggy and limp.  I think maybe they make a huge batch or something earlier in the day and then by the time they take a serving out it is all soggy. Daughter #2's buttered noodles were ""chewy"" according to her.  Again, small portion of noodles, no biggie, and two slices of garlic bread the size of crackers. My husband's Caesar salad looked like a standard chain restaurant Caesar.  He said his noodles in his pasta dish were over cooked though.   Our server was eager and friendly.  I was expecting Cheesecake Factory quality food based on the surroundings and the newness of the restaurant.  I was shocked at how sad and bad it was.  Seems like there are probably a lot of management issues that probably need to be worked out.  I can't imagine a chain could grow that big and be that successful if they are putting out bad service and food like that at ever location.

This results in every kind of screwup you can imagine. Last night, it led to my husband getting deep-dish pizza instead of regular... a $5.25 mistake on a 14"" pie. For more bread?? Really? It wasn't even that great. He didn't notice that there were TWO whole pages of pizza. Excessive... and the waiter should have clarified and/or should have actually looked at the page my husband was pointing to. The gluten-free pizza is OK, but I am too cheap to pay $1 per topping for a small 9"" pie. That's OK for meats, but there's no way you can convince me you were going to put an entire bell pepper on a pizza that size. The kids mac and cheese is Kraft and I can make it better than that with my eyes closed. It was dry and clumpy and not even hot. The 5-year old ate it, but said Annie's is much better. The veggies -- broccoli and carrots -- were limp and raw and horrible, even to grownups. The potato-skins appetizer should be good but it's deep-fried to within a half-inch of all the way through -- there's no tender potato guts left -- and at $9.25, it's a grease bomb. Service was slowish and was not much to complain about until he super-graciously started apologizing for forgetting our drink refills... and then he was grumpy about the pizza mistake.  It cost $20 more than Red Robin around the corner, and honestly, can't even come close on the service. With giant screens flashing sports and Faux News all around the room, the ambiance is not better. The tables are nicer, I'll give them that. But not $20 nicer. Oh yeah, and they're out of kid menus so they've got crappy 3-hole punched paper photo copies... she made a big deal out of apologizing about this but it didn't set a good tone. Kids don't care as long as they can color on something, really, so why the big fuss? The hostess station always has three to five people buzzing around... you know what? Teach some of those people how to wash dishes (my knife was filthy) or to cook, and reduce the wait times on food coming out of the kitchen. That would improve the experience a great deal. I wanted BJ's to kick Claim Jumper's butt but it is just a whimper better. Cheesecake Factory is MUCH better than this place and somehow does manage to execute on its giant menu.  This place needs to get 10-15% cheaper and then I will give it another star even with the same level of food and service.

I had to walk up to the bar (I have never done this before) to ask for a glass of water and take it to the table because ""everyone was just too busy"".  This is a classic example of how a restaurant should not be managed.

I would really like to personally thank him for finally telling her what she should order since her opinion doesn't matter when it comes to what she is going to drink.  3.

She then realized that we already received the salad plate, but she said you guys can keep it for free if you want while waiting for the chkn sandwich. It was ok but this got us a bit more confused.

402,Aaron H.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",90,25,,2.0,2013-10-13,"I attend the RTC exotic car show most weekends which takes place in the parking lot next to BJ's.  After being curious about the restaurant and meaning to visit it for some time, we went there last night for dinner. Because it was a Saturday night at prime dinner time, there was a bit of a wait.  The hostess told us 30-40 minutes, I think it was closer to 40.  As we waited, I noticed a few things. First, some significant portion of the people who shy'd away from the wait made their way to Claim Jumper.  I think that means that people see the restaurants as being somewhat comparable to one another.  After eating at BJs, I tend to agree but more on that later. Second, the entrance has three doors.  A rotating door that is flanked by two normal doors.  Kids tended to play in the rotating door and adults tended to come through the side doors.  Both were mildly annoying.  We had a three year old who accidentally ventured near the rotating door and almost got crushed as some kids were running in circles in it.  The doors on the side tended to slam shut when someone would come in or out.  With two doors doing this and tons of people coming in and out you constantly heard a slamming door.   Third, the bar and dining area have a really cool atmosphere.  Dimly lit, cool lighting behind the bar, lots of TVs playing different sports.  It all felt clean, modern, and somewhat cool. Once we got seated, we spent some time perusing the menu.  They had a nice selection of appetizers and entrees.  And an impressive selection of beers.  We selected a seasonal pumpkin ale and a few things off the appetizer and entrée list. The food arrived relatively quickly.  All off it was mediocre at best.   Fish tacos - The corn tortilla was tough, almost as if it was stale.  The fish inside had an overwhelming charred 'grill' flavor but was void of the type of seasoning one would expect on a Mexican inspired fish taco.  There were a couple of sauces on the side, both of which were relatively bland and uninspired.  We love fish tacos and we order them often.  These were some of the worst we've had. Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps - The lettuce was butter lettuce which works really well for wraps.  Each taco only had three shrimp but the shrimp were relatively well seasoned and not overcooked as many restaurants tend to do.  There was a salsa in each lettuce wrap that was OK in flavor but was really watery such that when you took a bite a pool of somewhat flavorless liquid poured out onto the plate.  These were OK but I probably wouldn't order them again. Pizza - Nothing too fancy, just a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  It was pretty good.  Given that roughly 1/3 of their menu was pizzas, it feels like this is something they endeavor to be good at.   In summary, given the atmosphere, beer selection, and televisions I think this would be a good place to go watch a football game with some buddies during which we'd have some drinks and eat an appetizer or two.   I don't think we'll ever go back to just eat dinner as the food just isn't good enough.   Hopefully they improve.  The food in the Texas BJs is much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=240,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.248,2.08

We sat in the bar and we were approached quickly by our waiter. He was a nice guy and definitely helped make the experience a positive one.  My friends had already had some oysters at Matt's across the parking lot, so they weren't as hungry as I was so we just ordered some appetizers. My buddy's girlfriend has recently found out she has a gluten allergy so she wasn't impressed with the menu but I thought they had a great selection, my only gripe was them not having jalapeno poppers, which I love but I'll get into that later. Anyways, my buddy and I ordered some chicken wings with ""Hot and Spicy Buffalo"" and ""Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze"" the Maui was the best and my recommendation if you get wings. We also had some spinach stuffed mushrooms that were ok and some chicken wontons that were ""Thai style"" and decent. I also had the house pumpkin beer and it was actually pretty good. I should note that since my buddy's girlfriend was eating gluten free we inquired about gluten free options and the server got a gluten free menu, which was pretty nice. The only problem with the gluten free options is that they are regular items on the menu that they just omit the gluten part of the recipe. We found out the ""hard way"" why this could be a problem. When the soup that was ordered came ou it had the croutons in it that were certainly not ""gluten free"" but they were easy enough to pick out. One last thing, and this is worth noting because it's so rare these days to actually get good customer service. As I mentioned above, I was a little bummed they didn't have my favorite app, jalapeno poppers, but they did have deep fried jalapeno slices on one of their burgers so I decided to get creative. I asked the server if I could just order a side of the breaded and fried jalapeno slices, since they didn't have jalapeno poppers. The server happily said that was ok and even suggested that I get it with the same dipping sauce they serve with the Crispy Fried Artichokes, which I thought was a great idea and did. The jalapeno slices were nice and hot and went well with the dipping sauce, you might try it if you are so inclined and you're welcome in advance. All in all it was a decent night out, ok food and drinks, but the customer service was really what shined here.

Another 10 minutes or so passed while we finished eating but still no sign of the hot fries.  Our server stopped by the table again, was surprised to see we hadn't gotten the said fries and told us he would go get those for us right away.  We waited a bit longer.  We really wanted some tasty, hot fries!  Sadly, they still didn't show up and neither had our waiter or anyone else with a check.   We stood by the table for a few minutes in the hopes that someone would see we were ready to go.  It would have been amazingly easy to dine and dash since no one seemed to care and man was I tempted to do so for the first time in my life!  Finally our flustered waiter realized we were ready to leave and was kind enough to split the bill 50/50 for us.  That was the highlight of our lunch experience.   There were only two of us.  It wasn't a large group or a complicated order.  For lunch time on a Monday we should have been able to get in and out in less than an hour but by the time we walked disappointed back to the car, more than an hour and a half had passed since we had parked. Since the bad reviews seem to go on for months for this location I can only assume BJ's management doesn't care that they are falling extremely short of so many people's expectations.  There are so many other great places to eat in Redmond don't bother wasting your time or money on this one!  Shoot, check out a mediocre restaurant in the area and you will STILL leave happier than eating at Redmond BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=220,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.212,2.24

Its like cheesecake factory very corperate feeling but sit in and at the bar and its more cozy and laid back. Happy hour prices on drinks r great but have to say i think discounts on food is much to little compared to the other happy hour prices in redmond.  Good experience tho every time.

I wished I had found somewhere else to go!!!   We were sat down in a timely manner and that was as good as it got. For the longest time no one ever came to talk to us (there were 10 of us) It's not like you could miss us!  Finally a young man came over to greet us, we told him our frustrations. He apologize and told us he was not sure who was supposed to be taking our order but he would do it.  1/2 the table ordered water to drink which seemed to take longer than the soda the other 1/2 ordered. Our salads were mixed up with one person  never even receiving her salad until AFTER the meals showed up. Then upon receiving her meal (and salad) they missed giving her stuff to put on her baked potato, which came about the time everyone was done. Another person didn't received her blackened chicken that was supposed to go on her pasta, it was eventually brought out, but we scratched our heads as to why it wasn't  on to begin with?!  The hamburgers were extremely salty, this coming from 6 people that ordered burgers, so whoever was seasoning their hamburger needs to back off a lot on the salt. So salty they couldn't eat them.

The first was the worst - we came for Mother's Day after they had first opened.  The long waits were hard, especially having young toddlers, we couldn't keep them still.  The food was out maybe 45 minutes to an hour after we ordered.  They remembered all the entrees...except my Mom's.  We were on a limited time schedule to keep the kids in line with their bedtimes and not wanting to wait another 45 minutes, my mom declined to have them bring make a new order.  Instead they offered to box it up for her to take home, which we agreed.  The wait for the food to come in a box was just as long and they were kind enough to give my mom a $15 gift card for her next visit.  When the bill came, my mom's entree was still on the check -  we were appalled.  I understand coming from the hospitality industry that the gift card is meant as a compensation, but I don't think they should have charged her at all.  She declined to have them bring it out after they forgot her entree, then they kept pressing to bring it to her in a to-go box so they could still charge for the entree.   I will say the food is average to good, depending on what you get.  The menus are so large it's overwhelming and the beers are decent.   When my fiancee and another friend rode our bikes along the Burke-Gilman we decided to try the restaurant again.  The same service was provided - or lack thereof.  You wouldn't see your server for 10-15 minutes and almost had to flag down anyone you could find.  I won't be coming back here until they get a grip on good service and timeliness.  If you ask me, their kitchen has issues executing their restaurant within a timely manner.  They couldn't even open the nicely designed outdoor patio because it would have made their restaurant far too large for the kitchen to handle (which is what the server told us when we wanted to sit outside).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=360,2.32,2.11,2.11,2.3440000000000003,2.194

I was thinking the service would slow down because of the amount of people there but, it was well staffed and the waiter was quick and always came around to check on us.

After about 45 minutes we walked out.  We asked the waiter numerous times to check up on our order (turkey clubs) and told him we only have 60 minutes to dine and that we need to get back to work.  Every time he promised us to check and reassured us our food was coming.  Unbelievably bad service.  Chalked it up to staff working out the kinks, but made it a point to avoid until.... 2. a friend convinced me to catch the second half of a Seahawks game there in December.  Atmosphere was great, lots of Seahawks fans and TVs, and I was hopeful. Long story short, waiter got our order completely wrong - food was delayed, some meals were brought, others were not and others were brought after half of our group had finished eating. None of the staff, including our waiter seemed interested in their jobs and serving their patrons.  They were all focused on talking to each other and the game.  ugh So save your money and time.  Do not dine here.  Plenty of other good restaurants in the area.  As a side note, I will be surprised if this place is still in business 12 months from now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=240,2.6,2.22,2.22,2.02,2.3720000000000003

He ordered the BBQ lunch platter from the ""I don't care about calories"" section of the menu. I ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop from the ""Under 575 Calories"" page. After about 5 minutes, the restaurant manager (I assume) came out and apologized that the first attempt at cooking my meal was unsuccessful. Apparently, they burned the pig right out of the pork.   I can't tell you how much I appreciate that the error in cooking my food was caught by someone else, before it was even served to me! AND that they'd go out of their way to tell me about it and apologize! Even my co-worker said, ""Wow. I've never seen THAT happen before."" I have, but only on Hell's Kitchen... and I was impresssed. Obviously, BJ's has great management. She even explained that it would take about 4 extra minutes to fire up a new pork chop (setting expectations - very nice!). She offered me my choice of soup while my co-worker was being served his meal. Another nice touch! Malibu Cafe (see my review) should probably be taking notes from BJ's on how to ensure customer satisfaction, but I digress... I opted for a bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. It was full of fresh chiles, avocado, chicken and a delicious broth, which could have been a little warmer, but it still mostly melted the cheese. My co-worker's platter consisted of BBQ Chicken, a BBQ pulled pork slider, and shoe-string fries. All were delicious. My pork chop came out in the time promised, and was BBQ'd to perfection; juicy, tender, flavorful, and lean. It was accompanied by red potatoes and green beans, which were also perfectly seasoned.

The pepperoni flat bread was reminiscent of a Totino's pizza from the 80's, without the pleasing chemical aftertaste.

Jeremy decided to try parmasean chicken for the first time, and I got the crispy jalapeno burger with a veggie patty. The veggie patty was made in house, +1 star! It was amazing! Jeremy very rarely legitemately enjoys things. He is always neutral. He really enjoyed his parmasean chicken, he couldn't stop talking about it for two days. I am happy when he is happy! +1 star. My jalapeno burger was out of this world. Absolutely the best jalapeno burger i've ever had, and i've had a lot. It was so spicy I had to take breaks and wipe my nose. THAT is a good burger. Even past the spice, you could still taste how well the flavors of all the ingredients worked together. +1 star. Our server was very very peppy and kind. He came for the order and stayed for the conversation, he was a sweetie pie. +1 star. Last star, and most important: the bun on my burger. It was fresh, hot and squishy.

The hostess was not very friendly and our server was probably the worst I have had in any restaurant in the last 9 years of eating out. Service was slow, which is fine as long as the service is friendly, but our waiter was extremely unfriendly, and seemed upset with us when we did not order any alcoholic beverages. We needed an extra napkin setting, as there was 3 of us, and only 2 settings, and when we asked for it, he said rudely ""fine...I'll get you one""...he never did, another waiter had to do it. Finally our food came (food itself was good). After we finished, we waited 20 minutes for him to show up, and after he brought the check, and as he cleared our plates, he got upset that a fork was still on a plate and pointed at my friend to remove it. He was extremely unfriendly. To give you an idea how bad the service was, this was the first time in 9 years that I did not leave a 20% tip. I always leave a 20% tip as a general rule of thumb, even if service is slow (as long as it's friendly). I still left a tip (10%), but perhaps I should not have left anything.

The Redmond joint could use some work. Let's start with the one thing you Never.  Ever.  EVER.  do to the Single Girl Diner:  seat her in the bar, without even asking her, just because she's an unaccompanied female.  ""Is this the bar?"" I asked frostily, as the hostess directed me straight to a table in the nearly-empty bar without even gauging my preferences first.  ""Yes, this is our cocktail area,"" she said.  ""I would prefer not to sit in the bar.""  And you should have asked me if I'd be all right sitting in the bar, but you didn't.  FAIL. In the regular dining room, I joined a few other couples, who'd presumably either not been directed to the bar at all, or had opted not to sit in the bar.  So I have to wonder why the hostess would think the bar a suitable default, when none of these other parties wanted it.  Seriously, I think sometimes restaurant employees believe, latently or not, that when you're an unaccompanied woman, and you walk into their restaurant, they have to find a place to hide you.  Heaven forbid our restaurant is seen as a place where women come to dine alone!  Gosh, that would be horrible! I ordered a house salad with blue cheese dressing, and an appetizer.  Appetizer was fine; no complaints.  House salad was tiny (they must have sent me a small; it was about half the size of the one I had the last time I dined at BJ's in Southcenter around the holidays).  The salad was also drowned under a minimum half-cup of dressing.  The species of the various leaf types struggled to be recognized under this white mudslide.  A pity, because they seemed fresh and appealing, once I pulled them free and let them drip-dry for a bit.  I guess I need to order the dressing on the side, if I ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=220,1.84,2.28,2.28,2.6320000000000006,2.104

I've tried the enlightened chicken and the other salmon dish and all were very good. The crusted chicken is also quite delicious, but a bit buttery. One of this most impressive items is their bone-in NY Steak, which was one of the best steak's I've eaten out (including the usual big chains, Ruths, Daniels, etc.) and for $23 with 2 sides, it's an unbeatable deal! The beer selection and cool atmosphere round out a great dining experience. Love the HUGE TV that they can put 4 shows on at once. Great place, will keep coming back. Miss Skip the bartender, but Josiah and everyone else are great too! A word to the wise, this place gets BUSY.

I found her tone with them far ruder than their conversing. Not such a great first impression. Next, it took a while to get a drink ordered. It was around 11:50 am, before the lunch rush. When the waiter did come by, his apron was DISGUSTINGLY dirty. Seemed odd since he just mentioned his day was just starting. Really gross to think of the germs and bacteria covering his clothing, from what looked like days of wearing between washing.  I ordered the lemon chicken. The chicken was amazing!

255,Susan R.,"Seattle, WA",40,6,,1.0,2014-10-09,"Went for brunch on Sunday. Yeah, it's not a typical brunch/breakfast place but we were looking to avoid a crowd. Unfortunately now we know why there was no crowd at all. We had a party of 6, including 2 toddlers that needed high chairs. We were seated at a booth (?) after we had requested 2 high chairs. We had to ask for them to place us where there was a table where 2 high chairs could actually be used.  Then there was confusion over how many children's menus we needed. Um... 2?  We ordered coffee and the waiter informed us it would be about 10 minutes because they just had 2 other tables order coffee and there wasn't enough. Really? Brunch on Sunday and you don't have carafes of coffee waiting?  I ordered a scramble and then was asked how I wanted my eggs. I had to repeat  my order and explain the eggs come... scrambled in the scamble? The waiter didn't appear to know the menu. When food came, 3 adults were served first. 2 of them had cold potatoes on the side. Then came the kid's food and the 4th adult about 5 minutes later. One adult sent back the potatoes and the other just decided not to eat theirs. Now, I know some people will say this is a bizarre complaint, but clearly the mac and cheese the kids ordered was from a box. Now, I don't expect gruyere and hand rolled pasta for a 3 year old, but is it really that hard to make a cheese sauce and some boxed pasta? So that was disappointing. I tried the mac and cheese and it really wasn't good, it's salt and orange coloring, what can you expect? My actual scramble was good. That was about the best part of the meal. We never got water or coffee refills the entire time we were there. Really? Again with the coffee you charge $2.25 for? We asked for 2 checks, one for each family (each sitting on one side of the table) and the checks came incorrectly, we had to ask them to fix it.

I went with the house amber and was very happy with my beverage choice. As for the food, it was ok, typical American bar fare. I went with the unlimited salad and soup - none of the soup was particularly good. The salads were a bit more impressive, and I enjoyed the wedge salad and tomato & mozzarella salad. My husband liked his Southern Fried Chicken, which was a lunch special. He thought the chicken was flavored very well.  Unfortunately, the snag in our meal came when I realized one of my daughter's chicken tenders was still raw in the middle. She was full eating the other two on her plate, so I didn't want replacements for the food, but I wanted to alert the server so the kitchen staff would know. Wow, the flurry of activity that ensued - the server was very upset on my behalf and kept asking if I needed any extra food or even a dessert for my toddler. Then, the manager came over and was effusively apologetic, as well, and informed me the kid's meal had been removed from our bill. It was all unnecessary but very much appreciated.

The beer brewed on-site is good and the food is okay although inconsistent. The service tends to be slow and non-attentive. My most recent visit we had a group of seven on a Wednesday evening. Took 50 minutes to get a table. Once seated got our drink orders. When our drinks arrived we ordered our food. The kids asked for some fries to eat while we wait and I ordered a side salad. After a long wait I flagged down the waiter and asked when we might get the fries and salad. He said he would check in that the kitchen was backed up. He brought out the salad and fries. He said he made the salad himself. After another long wait our food arrived. It had been close to an hour since we ordered. My pan pizza was luke warm and the crust was soggy. A meatball in a spaghetti and meatball entree looked like it had sat in the oven all day (black and dry). My son's burger didn't arrive until 10 minutes after the other food. I flagged down the manager and expressed my disappointment. He comped the pizza, spaghetti and burger and gave us two pazooki samplers which was appropriate. Turns out the kitchen was short a couple cooks. Better communication and attention from our waiter would have made a big difference.

Rude, very unsure of what he was doing, made it seem like everything we asked was making him go way out of his way and he rushed us out like there was a line of people at the door (there was not). The past couple weeks we have had great service from various waiters/waitresses but Roy made our dinner horrible.  He forgot to give me back my out of state license after getting it checked when I ordered beer- thankfully we went to the mall after and I noticed and we went back. When we were there getting my ID back I thought I'd talk to the manager about how horrible our experience was so she would know we frequent there and have enjoyed it until Roy came into our lives.  She totally blew the comment off and said she would coach better... After looking on yelp and seeing all the negative reviews I can see that obviously this coaching is not going well.

The only saving grace is the fact that it's brand new and the bathrooms are cool. Not what should be the highlight of your dining experience. I dunno desert fire was pretty awful so maybe it's just a curse of the building/location. I would never ever go to this restaurant again. So host was pushing the bar area (which kids can sit in) which was either her job or she was too lazy to seat the dining room. Honestly probably the later. There was only 1 server and probably 8-9 tables in the cocktail area. She was a mediocre server and was getting her butt kicked with no help. Took 20 mins to just get going, menus, drinks, food order... Then starts the real waiting, and I now have a lot of time to make observations... Guy and a girl flirting in the dining room, several people going out to smoke, I counted at least 3 managers, saw 4 cooks come in and I can tell it's clearly shift exchange, but jeez no one is actually working in this restaurant. 30 mins and our food finally comes out. It's acceptable but nothing to write home about. Until my nephew goes to eat his burger and it's burnt. Server tries to tell us it's just charbroiled, I've cooked burgers for a restaurant before... It was burnt, pretty bad and inedible. Replacement takes 25 mins to come out!!!! Now with all of the staff around doing nothing, bad server getting her butt kicked, lazy host, managers doing nothing I'm about to lose it, there was no reason for us to be there for as long as we were.... But my nephew wants a pizookie and those take a long time to cook. 15-20 mins they tell us... Took 45 mins. We are now being served by another server who took over that girls section. He's apologizing, but he just got here it wasn't his fault and he can tell I'm upset so he sends the manager over. Who apologized, but it wasn't genuine, took a couple items off the bill and walked away. We were in this restaurant for over 2 hours on a slow holiday weekend, with a zillion staff in the building and I have never had this bad of service in my life.

175,Erica P.,"Seattle, WA",88,184,994.0,3.0,2015-12-20,"Hooboy. I'm going to preface this review by saying that I have never had a bad experience at any BJ's, including this one. Until tonight, which just happens to be my birthday. I chose BJ's for a family dinner because the service has always been solid, and its menu has something for everyone) The food was up to par, but the service was seriously lacking. After taking our initial orders, our server just up and disappeared. She breezed by once, vowing to return with refills on all of our drinks (which were enpty), and then we didn't see her again until after our food arrived, and presumably only because we asked the gentleman delivering our food to please find our server so that we may get the refills she had promised. At that point, she returned, full of apologies and telling us that she was really busy, but she had asked for help. She asked if we needed anything else, and we asked for a few things (sweetener for tea, etc) which we never received.  She returned one last time to take our dessert orders, and of our party of 8, only my daughter ordered a dessert. When she brought out my birthday pizzookie (tasty btw), she neglected to bring out my daughter's, and upon review of our bill, she never put the order in at all.  Despite tonight, I'm still giving BJ's 3 stars, because I'm really hoping that the poor service was the exception and not the rule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=80,2.12,2.47,2.34,2.284,2.3300000000000005
21,Jessica S.,"Kirkland, WA",99,416,106.0,2.0,2015-12-21,"Just ... no. Went here last night for a birthday party. We didn't have a reservation so there was a wait for a table at the bar. No problem, right? Wrong. We grabbed a few tables near each other in the bar area while we waited to be seated, thinking we could order some drinks and appetizers while we waited - which we could have, if the waitress had been available. But during her rare appearances, it was clear that food service in the bar area was going to be limited. We could barely get drinks. Several people gave up waiting for her to take drink orders and just went to the bartender. This would have been okay, but once our group was seated, it was more of the same - a waitress who checked in here and there, but very long gaps in between. The kicker was this: even though we were a large group, and the woman at the head of the table was opening gifts and wearing a birthday crown, our server simply handed out checks when dinners were finished, without even inquiring if we wanted dessert or, you know, birthday cake? The food was okay, nothing special. A flatbread appetizer consisted of a very dry, thin flatbread with some chicken and tomatoes, but no sauce or cheese holding it together. My daughter was at another table where she ordered a deep dish pizza that also apparently had no sauce and was told she should have asked if she wanted sauce on it. Huh? Deep dish, no sauce?  The interior of the restaurant was pleasant enough, and the drinks were good, but mostly our experience made me miss the Mexican place that used to be here.

My In-law, my husband, my son and myself went to Bj's Brewhouse in Redmond yesterday around 315pm. The waitress brought our drinks and we didnt see or hear from her again till at least 25 mins later when our food came. Then not even 10 mins after our food came she comes to our table with the bill! We all still have mouths full of food we barely started eating. She doesn't even refill our drinks she is not concerned with us at all. Not even 5 mins later she comes back to see if we paid it yet. This waitress again didn't check any of our drinks or ask if we needed anything. The waitress came back like 2 minutes later again. The waitress was obviously rushing us. She explained ""they were kicking her out"" and 'she didn't want to transfer us"" but we just started eating. Finally she transferred us to some guy this guy waited forever to bring the bill then when he did he just dropped it on the table and walked off. He said nothing to us!!!! When he picked it up he said nothing. My husband went up to the station to ask him for a to go box right after he picked up the card cause we hadn't had a chance to say anything to him. When he brought it back with the to go box he CHUNCKED them onto the table without even looking at us it made a loud noise from hitting the forks and he didn't even stop before i could look up he was gone! I cant stress how rude and hard he threw the stuff down! Then my mother in law attempted to speak to ""a manager"" the manager didn't listen to anything she said. When she showed her the receipt the manager said oh BJ was your waiter..... The waiters name was not bj it started with an E. I do not think the woman my mother in law talked to was actually a manager the woman asked for no detail and did not introduce herself didn't give out her name. This issue needs to be addressed. To add more to it I had forgotten my phone there. While waiting to get my phone that same waiter ran right into me and said nothing didn't even look back.

335,Sharron F.,"Redmond, WA",0,22,,2.0,2016-01-07,"My husband specifically ordered his food without sauce- and asked for it on the side. No big deal- he does that all the time because of the sugar content of sauce. The food arrived WITH the sauce but my dinner arrived at the same time. We waited for TWENTY minutes for his meal to be fixed which came long after I was done. We fully expected the bill to have some sort of adjustment since sitting watching someone else eat and then having them watching you eat is not what you expect at a restaurant.  But then the bill came and no attempt at ALL was made to adjust for the error of the server or preparer. In fact, the server couldn't have thrown that bill on the table fast enough. It was sort of shocking- we still tipped him, but it was probably his fault.

We have kids, so the bring kids menus, but are out of Crayons, so the kids can't do the games, the waiter says, ""we have been out for 2 weeks not sure whats going on"". So we order drinks and start looking at the menu. (You are saying that is not too bad, right?), Now, the waiter comes to take our order and we want him to make sure he is aware we want checks split 2 ways, he responds with an OK, no worries we will do it at the end. (Remember this) While ordering food he is touching one of the babies hair and trying to be funny, and it really wasn't. Don't touch kids unless you know them or have permission from the parents. Then when bringing the food out salads came for some and not other, then some kids got there food while others had to wait. Now I had ordered a pizza and watch the waiter carry it out, drop it on the FLOOR, pick it up and say ""Well it landed on the bottom so you can still eat this"", and put it in front of me on table. SERIOUSLY. Then comes back and asks if I want another drink, but doesn't ask anyone else. The others had to ask the waiter, can I have a refill as well. Also didn't have enough silverware or plates, he took our order but couldn't remember what it was I guess. Also, he put the HOT plates in front of babies and leaves them there, just unbelievable. Its 9 PM now and we order a dessert and he comes back and says I took $10 off for the food I dropped, Mind you its a $13 pizza. So he comes to the table with one check, so I ask again if you can please split the checks, and please put the dessert on my bill. He comes back and says here is two bill and looks like I didn't put on your bill so the other person will pay for it. So did not listen to us, didn't seem to think our table was important and then billed us incorrectly. We got out of there at 9:20, not enjoying the food, the experience at all.

All was good until the manager who clearly should not be, told her to come over and educate us on ordering.  He said that ""blackened chicken"" means that it was just regular chicken that when put in the salad dressing ""turned black somehow"" and that they don't actually ""do"" blackened chicken unless its requested specifically when the salad is ordered. The server was dumbfounded as to why this was the case but under instruction from this idiot was forced to tell us this.   Let me educate you General Manager about your choice of manager... Hes not really a manager just cause you happened to make him one. Just like magical chicken doesn't turn itself black by itself. We verified as we were leaving.  Menu says salad comes with ""blackened chicken""...  But now that the manager educated us,  next time ill order correctly and say that I want ""blackened chicken"" on my blackened chicken salad rather than ""blackened chicken"".  Thanks BJs I've become that much smarter because of you.

We once lost 20 minutes of HH due to this because it took us a while to get seated and subsequently noticed in the restaurant area, but now I know better! The tap list at BJ's is really not too shabby. They brew several beers, covering a variety of styles. In addition to their own brews, they also pour beer from other local breweries. I've enjoyed BJ's own beers, especially the seasonal options: the chocolate stout and peach saison have been the standouts for me. However, they also always pour the scotch ale from Bellevue Brewing Company, which is one of my favorite Seattle-area beers, and I thus pretty much always end up ordering that as my second beer. You also get $1 off each beer during happy hour, which is decent but nothing to write home about.

67,Amber S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,7,,1.0,2017-03-08,"I come here all the time- and as someone who has been in the restaurant business since age 16, I was FAR from impressed with how management handled a situation. Let's start by saying my waiter was fantastic, the most polite man ever and deserves much praise. However; his manager needs to learn the politeness and hospitality that he has. My mom and I ordered an appetizer then shared a California Chicken Sandwich. Seemed like  a quick and easy lunch...this was not the case. The first sandwich took about 30 minutes to come out- as someone who knows what it is like to have a restaurant crash and burn during busy rushes this didn't bother me. The sandwich came out with black burnt bread- I tried to ignore it, but then it was completely cold. So, we asked out waiter for a new one and at this point were not even mad.  Our re-cook took about 20 minutes- as someone who knows that re-cooks and red tickets should be priority, this was not impressive. Also, the manager should have brought out the re-cook, this is standard practice. The second one arrives only to be burnt once again (not toasted well, but black burnt) At this point I am starving and just decide to eat it. Only one problem, the chicken was not cooked all the way and pink. The manager was notified by the waiter and came to take the plates- which I understood; however the way he grabbed them from my mom and I and comments and excuses he made were unacceptable.  He brings a third one and then tells us he is waiting on the fries and will bring them over. He never brought them out- never came back to check with us. At this point, I am under the full understanding that he does not care to keep us as a loyal customer so I am finished with BJ's. I used to be excited to eat here and admired the wait staff- but from the perspective of a long-time bartender on how management behaved here; I never want to return to hear his attitude and listen to him screaming at employees in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=40,2.24,2.16,2.308,1.7960000000000003,2.192

It just seemed like he wasn't paying attention in the first place. i wouldn't mind this if the restaurant were really crowded and it was a busy day...but...we were literally one of 2 tables in the place at the time. And lastly, we had ordered a soup to go and they gave us the wrong one which we didn't notice until we got home.

Sadly since BJ's has opened, its quality of food & service has plummeted to a new low. Salads are always soggy if they come at all, the once phenomena flat bread pizza has fallen below standards and usually shows up cold & soggy with the once delicious crust tasting stale. It typically takes close to an hour for your order to show up and the wait staff constantly blames it on how backed up the kitchen is.

82,Amiram H.,"Redmond, WA",46,26,1.0,4.0,2017-07-08,"Quality has a lot to do with consistency.  The ability to turn the exact same product every single time is considered high quality.  The ability to do just that usually implies selecting good ingredients, applying a good process, and verifying that the results are consistent with the requirements. It's good for flights, car manufacturing, and restaurants. BJ's of Redmond is a great sports bar, restaurant, grill, and more.  The place has a very wide variety of foods on the menu, drinks, and desserts.  We have been going to BJ's for years, and we have no intention of stopping.  Quite the contrary, we recommend BJ's and we take guests there when they come to visit us in Redmond. Today we went for lunch.  Looking at me you might think that a triple deck burger with all the trimmings and a bucket of fries followed by a gallon of vanilla milkshake will do the trick.  Not even close.  At BJ's I usually order one thing, and one thing only: a Santa Fe salad.  It's salad precisely the way I like it. If you are interested in the ingredients, you can take a look at BJ's website.  Here are the ingredients: Romaine, blackened chicken breast, red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes and crisp corn tortilla strips tossed with Santa Fe dressing. Usually, this is a very good salad, today it was different.  First look identified a missing ingredient, the chicken never made it to the salad.  A couple of bites revealed a sad fact: a second ingredient was missing as well: avocado.  Just to add insult to injury, a Diet Pepsi I ordered came flat, with a built in bucket of ice... My wife and I don't usually complain, but we did make an exception this time.  We called the waitress (feel free to use ""server"" if you wish), and expressed our ""concerns"".  To make a long story short: new guy on the salad line, grand apology by the GM (hard to tell what it stands for, although, General Manager is a possibility), salads dropped from the check, a new Diet Pepsi, and we were happy again. So here is the deal: BJ's is a great restaurant.  They are usually consistent, and consistently good.  The environment is great, and the food tasty.  The service people are courteous and kind.  In short, they had a problem, they identified it, rectified it on the spot, apologized for the failure, and paid the price. I suggest that even though our experience today was less than perfect, we recommend BJ's as a great place for lunch and dinner. And a lesson learned here: I usually avoid writing reviews on restaurants I frequent.  I write about occasional or one time visits, and I write on exceptionally good or amazingly bad experiences.  When it came to BJ's, I wanted to make sure everyone knows: mistakes do happen.  But if handled correctly, they should never affect the rating of a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond?start=20,2.4,2.05,2.3,2.8640000000000003,2.19

Our first waiter began our interaction cussing saying, ""first they order their food then they tell you how to f**king cook it"". You heard that right folks. After taking our drink orders he began to get frustrated and the computer program, cussing at it in front of us. Our waiter stated that he would be back with the drinks and would also seek help with the handheld device he was using to take our order. He shortly returned, without our drinks, stating that he would not be our waiter after all. ""(Insert name) will be your waitress, which is actually good for you guys because she is actually pretty f**king hot"".  Our waitress showed up and was much more professional than the previous one. She came shortly after with our drinks, and took our food orders. One or the two orders of our fries showed up almost immediately, which was odd considering we ordered them to be with our food. We waited for our food for quite awhile, our waitress notified us that our wings order was messed up by the kitchen. When the food finally showed, half of the wings were not even warm. The flavor was sub par and honestly you could get better quality chicken from a Wendy's 5 piece chicken nuggets! Meanwhile our other order of fries still had not shown up. At this point I asked for a manager to tell them about the food. Our waitress spoke to him and he appeared with our second order of fries....after we had already finished our wings.

13,Nath H.,"Kirkland, WA",0,6,,2.0,2018-01-05,This is the 2nd time we came here. First time was way better. We were made to wait for forever for food and burnt food. It's good they didn't charge for the wings which was delayed by 45 mins. But they still charged for the burned sausages they served. I would think twice before coming here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond,2.84,2.34,2.332,,2.54

The food was Pretty good, the server wasn't anything to write home about, but the reason for this review is one of the Hosts, I believe his name was Brennan? Very kind young man! He was very sweet with our family even when the wait was somewhere around 15 minutes, very funny and charming, he made the experience a positive one to remember!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-redmond,2.92,2.34,2.336,,2.572
