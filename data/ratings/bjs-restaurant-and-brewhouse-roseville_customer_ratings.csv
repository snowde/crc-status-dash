I called they said the wait was 25 minutes and when we got there we would wait 5 more minutes to get seated.  we got to the restaurant and made our way to the hostess who ignored my boyfriend and helped a guy who walked up after us...when we finally were helped she said the wait would be 25 to 30 minutes. I told her we called ahead and she had nothing to say. so we decided to wait outside..and smashburger was looking better and better so we left. don't call ahead it's a joke. the foods good from past experiences but i would stay away on busy nights.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=400,3.0,3.41,3.41,2.9480000000000004,3.246

386,Madeleine D.,"Roseville, CA",33,112,5.0,2.0,2012-03-16,"What has happened to BJ's? I've been to BJ's more times than I can count now.  I work right in the area and tend to go after work for a beer or some appetizers, and I used to really enjoy it.  But now it just seems like the service has gone completely downhill. Last night two of my coworkers and I decided to go out to eat after our shifts, and the first choice was BJ's.  It was Happy Hour and the hostess told us we could go choose anywhere to sit.  Originally when our waitress finally came over it took a good five minutes to get menus and a couple more minutes just for water.  My coworker ordered a mojito and I ordered a beer.  It took another five minutes for those drinks to arrive.  Finally, the waitress asked us for our appetizer orders which took nearly 15 minutes to arrive.  Keep in mind these were the mini-bites appetizers.. Quite a while to wait for a teeny-tiny appetizer that's fried. When she dropped off our appetizers, I wanted to try my coworker's fried artichoke appetizer.  I asked her before I bit in if it was hot and she replied, ""No. Not at all... Not hot. At all!""  I had ordered the mini meat balls and mine were not hot either, just slightly warm.  Not great. Finally we ordered and waited quite a while for our meals which were not impressive either.  We asked our waitress to refill our waters at one point and she acted very irritated at the request.  We also asked her to split our checks because the three of us were paying with separate cards and she literally took a deep, drawn out breath and seemed like she was extremely upset by this request.  My coworkers and I looked at each other and didn't know what to say.  One coworker quickly said, ""I'm sorry! If that's not okay..."" The waitress responded, ""No. It's fineee..."" *Another deep sigh*. The three of us didn't really know how to respond to her attitude.  She seemed to think that she was doing us some great favor by refilling our waters and the simple task of splitting the bill.  I'm almost tempted to not go back considering this is pretty typical of most of the service I've received here lately.  Last time I went to BJ's a friend and I ordered two beers and waited 25 minutes.  After that wait we decided not to eat there, and it took another half hour to get our check, pay and leave.   BJ's - your food isn't great, so you might as well do some extra service training to make up that deficit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=380,3.52,3.45,3.45,2.504,3.478

After waiting 30 minutes, the waiter dropped the plates off quickly without saying a word.  The tacos arrived looking quite different from the advertised picture.  The Mahi was almost non-existent and I seriously doubt whether it was really Mahi.  My entire plate was very cold and the tortillas appeared to have just come out of the refrigerator.

The calamari was tasty and we finished it quickly. The portion was a little on the small side though.  For the pizzas, I wanted to try both the BBQ chicken and the BJ's Favorite. I didn't want to order two different pizzas, so the waiter told me I could have both flavors on the pizza! So that's what I did. When it came out, I thought I was getting a deep dish pizza. What I saw was a normal pizza, and I was quite disappointed. Was I supposed to specify which one I wanted? Nobody ever said anything. Or maybe it was a deep dish and I didn't know it. Either way, still disappointed. Too much crust to topping ratio.  I also tried their new crispy jalapeno burger. It had about 5 or 6 deep fried jalapeno slices on the burger, but nothing was spicy. Overall, a mediocre burger but I wish it had more jalapenos so I could taste it more. Lastly, for dessert, I ordered a mini white macadamia nut pizookie. At this point I was stuffed so this was the perfect size. The cookie and ice cream combo was delicious! I'm a fan of any of their pizookies. Service is great here.

We were there because of a fundraiser for my daughter's school, Junction elementary. All the employees knew about the fundraiser. At the time we ordered we told our waitress Michelle that we did not have the flyer but could bring it up on our phone to show her. She was awesome. At the end of the meal she talked with Jeremy and she stated that he would not honor the fundraiser because we did not have the flyer. I asked to speak with him. When he come to the table he did not even let us speak, nor did he even say good evening. He was rude and said he could not honor without the flyer. Then he proceeded to ask what fundraiser. Really say no then ask for what. This manager has to be the worst manager ever! I can't even believe that a fine place like Bjs would even hire this incompetent fool. When asked if we could email it to him and maybe he could print it for us he immediately said NO! I asked could he photo copy someone else's he said well.....I guess. This type of employee should only be allowed to clean the toilets at a truck stop. He has the work customer service ever. The amount for donating was 15% of my bill which was $73.63 so we literally are talking about less than a $15 dollar donation. If I knew that the Jeremy was going to be so rude and ignorant, I would have rather just donated $20 to the school myself and not gone to dinner.

The last time I came here, the table we were seated at hadn't even been completely bussed yet, and we had to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to come over and clean it. I would have rather waited in the lobby for our table to be readied. I also feel like EVERY TIME I come to BJ's, I start out with one server, but rarely finish my meal with that same server. Typically, ten minutes into the meal, a new server is introduced so that mine can go on lunch. Why did they assign this table to that person in the first place, then? Just assign it to someone else. If you're running such a tight ship with your lunch schedule, then shouldn't you have anticipated this? It really irks me. This nearly always results in a forgotten order, drink or otherwise.

I have to say, that was one of the BEST appetizers I've ever had! I had a little bit of the chips and spinach dip. Also really good. I ordered the Hawaiian Ma hi Ma hi with pineapple fried rice. The taste of the meal was delicious, however it was lukewarm, almost cool when it was served to me. I like my meals hot to the point where I have to blow on the first few bites, but being as crowded and busy as it was, I just shook it off and let it go, because I didn't want to be the only one waiting for a redo of my meal. The Ma hi Ma hi must have been a little overcooked too because it had more of a ""dry chicken texture""  instead of a moist flakey fish texture. Definitely different than what I'm use to!  I had a Pizookie for dessert too (hot chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top). Very good! Stuck to the plate tho. Our waiter was a little ""off"" too.

579,Jim B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,2012-08-08,"I went there for lunch and  I ordered a salad and a classic burger, medium, no cheese, but with onion and shoe string fries. The waitress bartender said, I'll just order it medium well if that's okay?  I thought that was odd, but whatever.  I'm pretty sure I know why she said that, which I'll explain later.   No less than 5 minutes after giving the bartender my order, the food delivery person came up and asked if I had the burger  with no onion (this plate had wedge cut fries).  I told that I didn't order mine without onions, but he guy next to me, he had just been given the same style burger, said that must have been his because he ordered his without onions and the one he just bit into had onions, in addition, he asked for wedge cut fries.   I could see the bar tender was thinking the same thing I was, that the orders got messed up, but what's more is, I told the gal, that wasn't my burger and I hadn't even gotten the salad I had , JUST, ordered!  So the bartender tells the food delivery person that mine just needed onions, but first a salad and to follow her back.   So I'm thinking, if she thinks I'm going to take a burger, that the paddy was probably already precooked. How else could the burger have been done in five min of my ordering and why was the bartender insisting it be medium well?? Because the precooked the patties for the lunch rush???   So I get my salad, it was fine and the bartender says, we're remaking  your burger so it doesn't sit back there, but within 4, minutes later,  I haven't even finished my salad, the same gal brings out a burger, the same one(???), but this time, it's with shoestring fries, but again, NO ONION! So I say, this doesn't have onions, is this the same one that you just tried giving me 4 minutes ago? And I can the see the bartender is freaked and she says, she doesn't know what they would have done back there and she'll handle this.  Well she comes right back out with the burger, this time with onions, and tells me that she spoke to the general manager and he assured her it was a new burger. Really, the general manager is overseeing my burger?   So I cut the burger in half and it's well done and just above room temp.  I was so disgusted at the little game they were playing save a buck or two, that I didn't even bother eating and I just paid the and left.   I won't be back there as a place that is trying to save a buck-fifty  by reserving  hamburger patty for an $11 burger is surely going to skimp on quality other places as well.  No thanks BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=560,3.0,3.34,3.34,2.308,3.2040000000000006

The waitress that took our order must have practiced saying ""I'm sorry"" to the point that is a permanent part of her vocabulary.  I counted at least 30 ""I'm sorry's"" last night.  She took our drink order and everytime she repeated something incorrectly, she said ""I'm sorry. Sorry"".  We ended up giving her our dinner order at the same time, as we were not ordering appetizers.  One girl at our table ordered a pepperoni, mushroom and olive pizza.  She says ""Okay, pepperoni and sausage.""  The girl said ""No, pepperoni, mushroom and black olive.""  ""Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.""   She came back about 15 minutes later with the wrong soda, diet instead of regular, and did not bring my glass of wine.  ""I'm sorry. Sorry. I'll be right back with a regular soda and your wine. Sorry.  They seated all of my tables at once. Sorry.""  Okay, I didn't really need to know why she was screwing up, but I guess she wanted to tell us.  Twenty minutes later, the soda and wine were served.  She sent the manager over to apologize and I asked for a second glass of wine, which was delivered promptly. Our food was delivered and yup, the pizza was a pepperoni and sausage.  We sent it back and this prompted another visit from the manager who told us they would need to ""fire up a new one"" and ""Sorry about that.""  The food that we ordered was good, but the service was REALLY off. We received the bill and there was not one thing comped.  A couple of folks from our party excused themselves and spoke to the manager.  They did take the cost of the pizza ($20) off the bill and I received a gift card that would be worth anywhere from $5.00 to $500.00, but I wouldn't know until I return for another visit.  Nice. This place needs to provide better training for their staff.  Hearing ""I'm sorry.

570,Ashu N.,"Jackson, CA",0,17,,1.0,2012-11-25,"One of my favorite places to eat, especially because of the variety in the menu...but I honestly, cannot stand this location. I am sorry to say, but most of the waitresses (not waiters) lack quality customer service. Been here many times due to location and the party room, but last night was the worst service I have ever received at this place. Busy Saturday night as usual, understandable.  We was taken to a table that wasn't picked up yet and was ask to wait for a few mins. Yet the tables next to us was being clean but not ours? We had to wait. Ok, fine, no big deal. Waitress comes and asks us about drinks and makes suggestions. I told her we do not drink alcohol. Then she stated, she would let us look at the menu and come back. She comes back, takes our drink orders and takes her 10 mins to bring back water. Meanwhile, she is taking orders from the table next to us who came in after us! My friend made a comment stating ""I think she is treating us differently""...I states, ""oh no, why would someone do that?"" She comes back taking our orders, with no smile no anything, didnt even take our full order and starts walking away. I asked her if she would also start and appeitizer for us. She went away, table after us got served before us and I started noticing she was treating us different. I seen her at two different tables and her facial expressions and her monotone was very different.  As we waited for our food, not once did she come back and check on our drinks. I had ordered coffee, and it seemed it was an inconvience for her to get us coffee but it was ok for the table across from us. When I asked for a refill, she was at the table next to us. That is when she informed us the pizza which was the appeitizer was going to be a few more mins. She returns with cold coffee, no creamer and walks away before I can ask for some. She later comes back with all our food that was ordered at the same time, and just sets it on the table and walks off without asking if we needed anything else. Yet, again, my table is sitting there observing her with the table next to us and across from us. It took her ten mins to come back and ask if we needed anything, I asked for warm coffee and sauce for my pizza. The coffee refill never came, but my sauce did.  Finally, I got the hint, she did not want to serve us when she came with a check to our table and yet didnt let us get dessert? She put the check on the table, then states, ""This is your check, please stand it up when your ready."" about a good 30 seconds later she adds, ""Unless you want dessert."" Yet we have no dessert menu! and she already has our check ready? I was so confused and dazed by what was just happening. Especially, when I heard her asking the table next to us about dessert and making suggestions! I was soo upset! My friend said, he had noticed it all along, but thought he was just being picky. This waitress for some reason did not want to serve us, I dont know why, I really dont want to know why, but it is very unacceptable and I would surely remind my friends not to eat here if possible. I love the food, but not the service at this location. I wish I knew her name to file a complaint right then and there, even saw the manager in the blue shirt walking up and down the isles. But my friend did not want to make a scene.  To the girl who did not get a tip from us tonight, you are lucky I didnt have the time to sit there and write how rude you was being to us on that recepit. I work in customer service and I could not believe the type of service you gave us without any reason behind it.

582,Rich R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",3,30,,2.0,2013-03-08,"I was dissapointed with my experience here. I don't usually frequent BJ's cause I think there are better places for pizza in the area, but decided to give it a shot since I received a birthday coupon for a free pazooki dessert. Plus, I always wonder why there are usually allot of people waiting outside when I drive by. So when I got there I was by myself so I wanted to sit at the bar. I found a spot at the end of the bar closest to the bathroom side. It took a little while to be acknowledged by the bartenders. I finally got a menu and once again waited for one of them to take my order. So I ordered one of there beer sampler's and a California Club flatbread pizza. The beer was what I expected it to be which was ok and the pizza was good. Nothing to extraordinary. But the real problem I had was there were two servers who had obviously had relations and decided they were going to argue right there and then. The male server was obviously really aggressive and wouldn't let the female server do her work until he got his words in. Not the place or the time for that crap. That's why you never hook up with someone at work, it's an unwritten rule that they obviously did not know about. The male server even came up to me and appologized since I was in ear shot, but little did he know that I block out negative drama like that. So then I was ready for my free dessert and was happily surprised that I had different options of flavors of cookies and ice cream. But, I just wanted the regular chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. So after a while someone brought me my pazookie and I realized it was a tiny little cookie with a small portion of ice cream. You would think with the business that they get that they could at least give you a full size portion like allot of other restaurants do. But even worse, it was chocalate ice cream with a peanut butter cookie. The bartender told me that they ran out of vanilla ice cream and thought I would like this combo! Who runs out of vanilla ice cream???? So after all is said and done, the service was sub-par, the food was ok, and I couldn't even get what I came there for in the first place. Not sure if I would go there again on purpouse since there is better pizza places in the area. The customer comes first and left feeling like they had plenty of business and didn't care if I had a bad experience.

428,Nicole I.,"Sacramento, CA",191,216,389.0,1.0,2013-06-15,"I went to the Roseville BJ's for my little sister and brother's birthday parties with the entire family and a couple of friends. There's a BJ's in Natomas and I know that it can get crowded and so it's best to place a reservation if you want to eat at a certain time. My mom called a week ahead and they said that they do not take reservations but could put us on their call-ahead list that we could place our names on about an hour before we wanted to get there. I called a couple days later and was told the same thing so I called the morning of their party and was told that it wasn't busy yet and to call an hour before. An hour before her supposed party, I called to make the ""call ahead reservation"" for 15 people. The woman on the other end of the line told me that they can't reserve tables for that many people and that I should have called ahead to make the reservation. Hand-palm. I called my mom who was with the rest of the clan driving to Roseville and told them the bad news. They had gotten there early and so they ended up waiting a half an hour for enough tables to be put together for our party.  We all ordered our food and the server gets our drink orders. Half of the table gets their drinks. The rest of us wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, I flagged down another waiter and asked him if he could look into our disappearing drinks. They were never entered and so he briskly brings them out. We continue to wait on our food and after a while, a couple of salads came out. When you are paying over $15 for an entree that comes with a side salad, it had better be decent. The salads were from bags that you could pick up from the local grocer for $2 a bag. Seriously? Bagged iceberg lettuce as a side salad for a filet? As time passed, food gradually found it's way to the table. Three people would get their food, then there'd be a ten minute wait and two more would get their food. We told people to start eating their food as it was going to get cold by the time everyone got their food. After another 10-15 minutes, everyone except my husband (who ordered a veggie burger with cheese) got their orders. The waiter made his way over to see if everything was ok. We told him about the burger and he looks at the tab and says the kitchen didn't make it. He places the order in and I wait for his burger, thinking it can't take longer than 15 minutes. Everyone else eats their meals and a half an hour later, my husband finally gets his veggie burger. It's a veggie burger not a steak- all it needs is a couple of minutes on the grill to warm up but apparently not at BJs. Everyone else had finished their meals and we quickly eat ours as we are way past starving. We file out of the restaurant and head over to Ulta to pick up a couple of products. In the store, both me and my husband get the stomach gurglings and run to the bathroom. Nothing. We decide it's best to get home so we jump in the car and everything was seeming ok then the demon spawn (or bacterial growth) inside my stomach started to unleash its fury. The drive from Roseville to North Natomas has never been so long with both of us in tears as we drove on the freeway. When we got home, my husband induced vomiting thinking that he would save himself somehow. It didn't. I opted out of the vomiting and just stayed planted on the toilet. The stomach cramps were so bad that it felt that someone was clawing out of our bodies. We considered going to the hospital but neither of us were able to move much less drive the 15 minutes to the hospital so we stayed curled up in our bed. It took 2 full days to recover from whatever we got from the burgers.  My mom called the restaurant and was forwarded to corporate. She gave them our phone number and they got in contact with us. When I talked to their rep, she was ticked off that I didn't go to the ER (she was subtly questioning whether or not we got sick). She said that that specific franchise had never had any type of food poisoning problem, insinuating once again that we were somehow trying to scam the system. You can't fake the feeling of having an apocalyptic hell beast claw out of your stomach. No one has that great an imagination. She said she would send a gift card to make up for our experience and after we got it in the mail, we quickly handed it off as I do not trust any restaurant that gets me that sick for that long.

I really liked the dipping sauces (marinara and a slightly garlicky cream) that came with the dish. I had the Texas-style chicken fried steak with a pepper cream gravy. Very credible CFS and the gravy was tasty. Only thing I would add is a touch more salt, but that is my taste buds. This dish comes with white cheddar mashed potatoes but I substituted the wedge fries instead (no reason other than I like fries with my CFS). It also comes with fresh veggies that were not cooked to mush (really hate when that happens). Hubby had the pulled pork sandwich and wedge fries with cole slaw. The BBQ sauce was just the right amount of tangy and the pork tender. My hubby is not a small man (not big either) and he couldn't finish his dinner and neither could I.

I came in first and got a table for our group and waited for about 5 minutes alone. The waitress came over and asked about drinks. I asked for water all around and said I'd like to wait for the rest of my group before ordering. She continued to ask me about alcoholic beverages and appetizers, and I had to repeat that I was waiting for other people. When they arrived, we put in the rest of our order.

For Vegetarians, I have had the Fettuccine Alfredo which was good and so was the bread it came with. The Veggie Burger is good too, especially with fries and on sliced sourdough. The Giant Pretzel was good as well, especially for Happy Hour! The Sour Cream and Chive Baked Potato is good. And lastly, the Deep Dish Pizza was good, probably the item that I order the most.

They are always busy, but the restaurant is huge so there is never much of a wait (if at all) and the service is always top notch.

The teriyaki chicken was okay, I've tasted better at other restaurants. My girlfriend had ordered the chicken Alfredo, but that was subpar.

Now I'm giving 2 stars because our beers came out in a timely manner and are always good (try the Jerryburst it's a combination of their Berry Burst and Jeremiah Red) and our server was decent. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken (my usual) and my boyfriend ordered a deluxe burger with thin cut fries. We were waiting probably 45 minutes when our server let us know that she was checking up on our food but when our food came out my chicken was dry, the mashed potatoes were lukewarm and my broccoli was mushy. Like so mushy you could feed it to your toothless grandma and she'd be able to chew it, swallow it and not choke. My boyfriend wanted his burger medium rare and it came out well done and his fries were cold. Now I've been to other BJ's locations where it's been busier than this BJ's was tonight and have had faster service so my meal here was pretty disappointing. Lesson learned from this: stick to the BJ's in Elk Grove with my usual server because she's awesome.

Uh girl, if you weren't chatting away with your coworker you would have notice us. We ended up sitting near the bar with the tall tables and chairs, which was fine with us. Took a couple minutes for a waiter to come around, which was fine with us since it was so busy, and I work in a restaurant so I know how it goes. Took about 5 minutes to have a waiter come over. She was nice, took our orders and brought our waters. My boyfriend and I got bison burgers, which were really good we thought, my boyfriends dad got fish and chips and his mom got the salmon I believe which she thought was really bland and boring.

Finished eating and it took 10 minutes for someone to take our empty plates..... Alrighty then. Overall the experience was alright, can't really expect much from a chain restaurant though.

When we FINALLY got our drinks they couldn't figure out who got what. The cream soda (which was flat) was given to the person who ordered a beer and the guy that ordered the beer got a diet soda- the diet soda was supposed to be for the person who got the regular soda and the three that got water never got it... maybe if they had asked instead of guessing we wouldn't have had to play musical drinks. Dinner came AGES later... one of our plates was brought out about 15 minutes before the others and when the others arrived one was forgotten- which then took about 15 more minutes to be served... making a total wait time from being seated to having dinner served for all of the guests 90 minutes. When dinner was served it was disgusting at best.  The fish and chips were so over breaded that I literally had to dissect the fish portion from the breading- but couldn't really get the fish because it had been soaked in oil so long that it was a soggy mess engulfed in about an inch of burnt greasy breading... the chips weren't bad though- so there's one silver lining. We should have known better but we decided to give it one last chance and order pizookie platters- one person was celebrating their birthday so they got their own pizookie- they ordered the triple chocolate and got just chocolate chip =( the platters were also wrong... how hard is it to warm up a cookie and put ice cream on it... come. on.

If Denny's was the bar I was setting Bj's would have come in a close second to food and service but killed on price.  Calamari was tasteless rubber I think the managers need a trip to the coast to get a real taste of how calamari should taste and be prepared. This is your job and you should be expecting more and demand better of the staff and kitchen. Hey maybe turn off the sports shows and learn something by watching a cooking show it can't get any worst. Hamburger ordered medium came well done burnt and not just on the crust but actually burnt through excellent quality control! Server never returned with anything we needed that we ordered without asking for it 2-3 times to everyone around. The french dip had old dried out beef that actually had burnt crust on the edges of the roast beef so it was so dry and tasteless it could have been three weeks old. Then to skimp on the Au Ju  sauce made it even worst. The cheese just made it sadder. Managers go to Trancas Steak House in Napa it's not that far but order a french dip then go into your database of everyone that has ordered this from Bjs and send them their money back with an apology. 55 minute wait was only 15 minutes but I wish I had just left and gone to anywhere else so do yourself the favor and blow this joint off they will be closing soon enough.

I have been coming here since it first opened and I have always enjoyed it. I've been here with big parties (10-15 people) and small (1-4) people. For the most part, we are taken care of.  The food is normally hit or miss. Sometimes I will have a meal that leaves me wanting to come back the next day and then there are meals that make me question if I should ever return. The service is always hit or miss as well. For the most part, it is better then it is worse. Today, when I went on a lunch date with my girlfriend, it was just an average overall experience. They were not packed, the wait for our food was rather long, and the meal was just ok. Nothing stood out. For those who have had a bad experience, I suggest coming on the weekdays, when they are less crowded. I always give a place that I had a bad experience at a second try. I have always given BJ's a second try and it's always better the second round.  Overall, my experiences have been ranked from really great to really bad.

He sat there waiting for a new one while the rest of our party enjoyed their entrees.  When the bill came, the pasta was still on there.  I felt like it was unfair for him to have chewed on a piece of plastic, watched everyone eat while his plate was remade and then pay full price for something that was entirely not his fault.  This is not the first time this has happened.  The last time we were in the server dropped my grandpa's plate on the floor and he waited for 10-15 for his food to be remade while everyone ate and again the entree showed up on the bill. Managers knew of both of these occurences and did nothing make the situations better.

She apologized and brought me a damp napkin, but what ever happened to the comp for dry cleaning? Stuff happens, I get it, no big deal.. really. But: my bbq pork sandwich just went from costing me $9 to $21. Our server kind of made a weird comment/question ""Crisis averted?"" ...

There were people who got there after us and got their food before us and to have the food come out wrong was too much. I don't normally complain, there is someone else in the family who always does it first, but  I got up and asked one of the many workers, huddled around the cashier not doing anything, to get me a manager.

We ended up doing the soup and salad for lunch - let's be honest, there's no cooking involved with either, should be fast dishes - but we waited about 15 minutes before he even took our order, and another 15-20 minutes before our food was brought out. We were about 3/4ths through our first round and wanted to order our 2nd, and tried to get his attention on several occasions but he ignored us!

We placed another round, and again took 15 minutes to come out - and the 2nd round - the bowls and plates of food are 1/2 as small - so why it took so long, who knows! At this time we were done - and rather than staying - we just asked for the bill. Took another 20 minutes for the bill - seriously - ridiculous and our drinks NEVER got re-filled. For lunch - for 2 bowls of soup and 1 salad each, we were there for nearly an hour and a half - I WILL NEVER COME BACK!

However,  all of that changed today. We got the worst server in the world. For an appetizer we ordered the calamary. My daughter ordered unlimited soup and salad. The rude despicable server came back to our table after putting our order in and with her finger pointing said to the four of us. The soup and salad is only for one person.  You can't all eat from it just because it's unlimited.  First of all this was purely stereotypical to a black family. We were flabbergasted. She then bought the appetizer and another employee bought the soup and salad.  We had no desire to order anything else,  nor to eat anything.  I promptly went to the front counter and asked for a manager.  The assistant GM came out and when the server saw me taking to him she came by. I told her to her face ""You do no need to go back to our table.  I told the manager how disgustingly rude this was and asked for our bill so that we could leave. He said he will have a talk with her. While he spends his time talking with her,  we will Never Ever Return To BJs again.  I have never experienced such stereotypical prejudice in a restaurant.  To assume that just because we are black we were going to share unlimited soup and salad is horrible.  If each of us wanted soup and salad,  we had plenty of money and we would have been more than happy to order some for everyone.

Pretty gross not knowing what your sliding around  on as you walk through the bar area. Since I'm on the bar area now, revisiting this place brought memories of a disgusting smell coming from the bar that I remember from my last visit as well. It smells like a dirty dishwashing area that doesn't get properly cleaned. Besides their cleanliness issues, their hostess station is incompetent. There was only 2 of us, not a large group or anything. We checked in, we're told it'd be about 15 min. After around 30 min and seeing numerous people come in after us and get seated before us, we asked what was going on. Apparently they have some ticket system they use because the girl stated oh, here's your ticket, he'll seat you now. Don't know if that meant they forgot to put us on the cue or what but it was obvious by their reaction we were forgotten about.  Once we were seated, a waitress greeted us very promptly but after that it was few and far between. I have no doubt we could have walked out and it would have gone unnoticed for a half hour or more.

257,Juan M.,"San Francisco, CA",129,95,4.0,2.0,2015-01-07,"I would give a higher review if we were able to eat our food the night we ordered it. It's a busy place. It always has a small wait, sometimes a long one. We call ahead to the location closer to home.  This time we kinda didn't know we were going to eat there. On our way back from a weekend at the lake, we stopped by with the Aunts. We were sat pretty quickly and the waitress came soon after. The Mr and I were splitting a pizza and a wedge salad. My aunts were having a pasta dish and a burger.  It took a long time to get our food and we never saw our server. When the runner brought out our food it was cold. well, the pizza, burger and fries were cold. Not warm, cold. The pasta was warm, no where near hot.  Our server was no where to be seen. She was busy. They are always busy. So I went up to the hostess and told them what was up.  Jennifer, the manager there, was sent over and was really pleasant and apologetic. She offered to do whatever we wanted. Remake our food, heat up our food. Whatever we wanted. That's why I gave them an additional star. She was great. We had to get back on the road, it was well after 9pm and we still had to get back to SF.  You can't heat up a medium burger, it becomes well done. What's the point in that? We could have had our pizza reheated, but how long would it take? My aunt ate her pasta as it was warm. We had the rest boxed.  She comped the pasta and the pizza. That was nice. She did the right thing. We also got our salads at the same time as the cold food. That was weird. Not sure how the timing worked on that one. Expect to be there a while, wait for a table and wait for the food. If all goes well, the food is tasty and everything is fresh. The first time we went, we had a great server and a great meal.

299,Terre P.,"San Jose, CA",244,200,101.0,1.0,2015-01-12,"It was Saturday night and apparently a brewery is the place for teenagers to go for prom.  Also apparently this BJ's was a little overwhelmed by the crowd.  We arrived about 7:45 after sitting all day at the nearby hospital.  We put in our name about 7:50.  We were told about 15/20 minutes for a table.  At about 20 after 8:00 (it had been about 30 minutes) I mentioned to my husband that it had been a long time and maybe I should check on the table.  He assured me that they would buzz us when it was time -- that is what the pagers are for.  At about 8:32 I said we really should check . . . and by we, yes, I meant him.  He went over to the desk and I saw them give him a new pager.  Apparently ours was broken, he was told when they walked through the bar area --- which was packed full, with muliple sports events being played on multiple TVs -- saying our name, no one answered.  So I am guessing that people check in and walk off with the BJ pagers all the time?  I guess since we didn't answer they assumed we left?  With the pager?  My husband said that he was told another 5 to 10 minutes . . . which would put us at 8:47 three minutes from an hour after we checked in.  I waited exactly 5 minutes then I went to tell them that they needed to seat us or I was going to start eating their customers . . . . I was very hungry.  They were going to clear a ""4 top"" for us ""because we had been waiting a long time.""  Ya think?  While I was at the hostess desk my hubby went to the restroom. I was looking for HIM when I happened to notice a small young man standing at the very edge of the bar mouthing our name.  REALLY?  The second pager they gave us didn't work?  And this little man was standing at the edge of the bar ---- NOT WALKING THROUGH THE BAR AREA --- STANDING at the edge saying our name?   I'm thinking the fumes must affect the brains of the people working here . . . . . . So since we had an HOUR to decide what to eat the minute the server -- or whatever he was -- came to the table we were able to order.  My hubby and I ordered the same thing except he asked for a side of mayo IN ADDITION the mayo ON the burger.  I asked for a different type of bun.  The waiter started a conversation about using mayo to dip fries in -- so it was clear that the mayo ordered on the side was for the french fries.   By 9:30, we still didnt' have our food.  And when it arrived.  There was a tiny little dish of mayo.  Enough to cover the tip of the knife and no mayo on either burger.  The person that delivered the food was not the person that took the order nor the person that took over for the person that took the order.  She was a drive-by server I call her because she didn't really stop as she ran by setting the plates down, we hollered after her to bring us additional mayo since it seemed as if there was none on the burgers.  Also, I didn't receive any produce on my burger.   Since the drive-by server was so rushed and already gone, I went back to the front desk to inquire as to who I need to talk to about getting produce for my burger.  She asked what kind of burger I ordered.  Well, the same one my husband ordered yet he has produce and I don't . . . . So she said what would you like, I said, ""Lettuce.""  She said, ""Any onion?""  I said, ""Oh, why yes, that sounds nice.""  I wasn't even thinking of onion, but once she said it that sounded good.  So they brought me a plate of lettuce.  Yeah, really.  So I asked where my onion was and he had to go get it. The beer was good.  They had a cider that was nice.  I was so hungry by 9:45 --- ya know, almost TWO HOURS after we arrived for dinner --- that I would say my burger was very good.  Both of our burgers were over cooked . . . but I was so hungry I didn't care.  My hubby did.  So I probably don't need to say that we will not be going back to BJ's --- for burgers at least.   I've been to this location before and, why yes, they are S L O W, but this brought it to a new LOW. I wrote this post soon after my experience, but didn't post it.  Now that my niece wants to go here for her birthday, I am posting this.  Because I am throwing a little fit with my family and telling them I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO BJ'S.  It will be Valentine's Day and I am absolutely positive that this location WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE VALENTINE'S DAY AS THEY COULDN'T HANDLE THE CROWD FOR PROM.   So, if we end up here you will know because I will be the one that was dragged in kicking and screaming!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=280,3.08,2.88,3.004,2.6600000000000006,2.9600000000000004

We've been coming here since their opening and used to like them in the beginning. What started as a great beginning, it became tumultuous when I had ordered several party trays that were supposed to feed 10-12.  Much to my dismay, when I opened the containers when I got home, it was enough to feed maybe 4-6! I was shocked because when I attended a friend's party who ordered the same trays at the BJ's in Natomas, their party trays were loaded with food enough to feed more than 12 peeps.  I had called the store the next day and spoke to the manager. He apologized and told me he would reimburse me with a gift card. Well, a week went by and no gift card. I called back and spoke to the same manager, he tells me that there must've been a mistake and he takes my name, and address, a second time, to no avail! I felt like a fool! Never received the gift card, even after the second time! I should have called corporate, but didn't think of it, at the time. This was some time ago, and even with the rough patches, I still continued to patronize this chain.   We've come back time and time again, usually with relatives or friends. It's been hit or miss.  On one of our recent visits, we had a gift card we needed to use. We were seated immediately, but waited for almost twenty minutes before our server ever came. We flagged a server and she notified our server.  He apologized and told us that he didn't know we were seated and he was busy in the kitchen area. That was a lie because he was just at the table in front of us taking their order. Anyway, we place our order and we ordered appetizers and two entrees from their new light menu. Our apps arrived and as soon as we started with our apps, the entrees come out. We were a little annoyed. Hubby's entree was not what he ordered. Our server comes by and we tell him that wasn't what hubby ordered. He checks his tablet and reassures us that he did put in for the right item. He comes back later (I'm practically finished with my meal) with hubby's dish. Not sure who to blame? Kitchen must not know how to check orders!? Their new enlightened menu items are low in calorie but it is lacking in taste, in my opinion. My scallops were not as appetizing as I had envisioned. I only took a few bites, and lost interest. When the manager came over, we told him our dismay and he takes our small bites appetizers off our bill. Nice, but we've had one too many misses here.  I'm quite conflicted when it comes to BJ's, it's one of those places that's not on the top of our list.

Otherwise, it's a good dish. The pot stickers tasted very good too including the sauce. No issues at all. The service is a hit-n-miss.

I opted for the North Beach Mahimahi shrimp dish over couscous. I didn't realize I had ordered fish soup (sarcasm). The fish was advertised to have a ""Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub""...yeah no, it must still be in the desert because it wasn't on my fish. The shrimp was supposed to be sautéed, more like nuked, and I was expecting traditional couscous, not lumps of pasta. It was also supposed to come with Kalamata olives which I'm assuming were lost out in the desert with the Big Poppa's rub. There was no seasoning except the flavor of chicken broth. Even the fresh basil had no flavor. My husband had a small Sweet Pig deep dish pizza. He said it was undercooked, doughy, and flavorless. My son had a CHEESEburger, however it would appear that the cheese too was lost with Poppa's rub and the olives. What was left was unseasoned and tasteless. However, he did rave the french fries were awesome. It also took an eternity to get our dinner...hmmm...maybe they were out searching for the elusive rub, olives, and cheese. Not sure.

105,Avolyn F.,"Sacramento, CA",192,71,41.0,2.0,2015-10-19,"BJ's has become a regular place for me and my boyfriend to eat. It's reasonably priced with some good dishes that you can consistently rely on to taste just how you like them once you've found your favorites. I used to live near Arden and primarily frequented that location and then sometimes Folsom and Roseville as well as the one in Stockton. Almost every time it is a great experience. For some reason this location is the least consistent. Servers are hit or miss. The last couple of times they seemed like they would rather be elsewhere. The food is also hit or miss. Last night my boyfriends pasta that he orders every time we go here was bland, even I thought it was unusually bland because it was tolerable for me when normally it's too overpowering for me. (good news for me I guess but bad for him, he barely ate half). My pizza was pepperoni and mushroom but my mushrooms were added after the pizza had been baked. They were cold and raw almost as if they were forgotten until the server was about to take our food out to us. The prior visit we had to this location my chicken dish was burned, not just blackened but tasted completely burnt and I could not taste any other flavor than burnt. I am not one to complain about food at restaurants because usually I can manage and I just know what not to order next time but the server came around asking how things were and I just gave him the feedback that the cook may want to ease up on how he cooks the chicken dish. They then offered to take the dish off of my order which I told them was not necessary but I appreciated the gesture. Either way nice of them, but it was my last meal home before leaving for 2 weeks on a work trip, a bit of a disappointing last meal. I have gotten that dish at 2 other locations and loved it each time. The visit before that we had a coupon to use and it took us 3 times to get it applied to our receipt correctly. The manager got involved but seemed oddly defensive even though we weren't upset. Overall, might have to avoid this location in the future when I know I'll have a positive experience at the other locations.

Our mudslides took 15 minutes, I exaggerate not because our flatbread got their first. A young lady brought our food, and finally after asking she brought our drinks.

He brings the food back with sausage and my free pizookie.  Mind you 2 hours go by from the time I originally ordered the to the time I go back to bjs to get it fixed. 20 mins before closing. The food was prepared wrong from the beginning. When I took the food back he didn't once attempt to make me a new dish. The same food was tossed again, and again.

129,Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,1.0,2016-03-17,"I highly recommend against ordering any food to-go from this BJs because literally every time I've ordered something to-go that wasn't a pizza, they either screwed up my order, charged me the wrong amount, or both. In today's instance I ordered (online) a burger, fries, and a salad. A salad came with the burger but I wanted a different one so I substituted it with fries. When I picked up my food they gave me the salad, the wrong burger, and no fries. I called the person who gave me my food back over and told them of the error but instead of trying to fix it they just spouted off excuses about what happened. The burger was just buns, a patty, a slice of onion, and sauce. I've gotten this burger before and there was a whole bunch of other stuff on it so when I asked why this didn't have any of that on it, the person said the ticket indicated that I requested no greens on my burger. The sticker on the box said ""no mixed green salad"". I told them that was referring to the salad I switched out for the fries and they gave this idiotic response saying ""well they must have interpreted it as you didn't want any greens on your burger"". I think the cooks are dyslexic or just really incompetent for getting such a simple instruction completely wrong and believing it to mean ""take half the stuff off the burger"". I still didn't have the fries so they said it was going to be a few more minutes since they had to cook more. After that they went over and started chatting with the hostesses who were also not doing their jobs because they seemed to ignore everyone who came in the to-go door and didn't even bother to go find someone to help them (and me when I first walked in). At no point during this ordeal did they offer to take my food back and have it redone and I wasn't going to ask because at this point I was fed up with the shitty service and the ""take it or leave it"" attitude of the person I was dealing with and I just wanted to get home. Maybe I was foolish to believe that BJs couldn't possibly screw up my order every time I ordered something from here which is why I kept coming back but I guess I was wrong.  Be warned: they apparently don't give a crap about you unless you dine-in and I'm not the only one who has issues with the to-go orders; many other people have left similar reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=120,2.52,2.73,2.84,2.308,2.646

Everyone at the table ordered a meal and added either a salad or soup.  Salad and soup arrived as ordered.  Prior to the meal arriving, the waiter who initially took the order came over stating our waiter would change and introduced the new waiter. Shortly thereafter, the meal arrived, but not by either waiter.  I was asked if I had received my meal, which happened to be a salad (not a side-salad) and a indicated I had not. From that point on the waiter, nor the server who brought the food returned.  Nealy 25 minutes passed and the waiter finally returned asking if there was anything else he could get us.  I mention to him that I never received my meal, but at this point I didn't want it.  He kept insisting he could bring it to me in a to-go box.  I explained to him that I came to dinner with the company of my friends to enjoy a meal TOGETHER, not me watch them eat and I eat my salad later at home.   His resolve to the problem was to take just the salad off of the bill, which wasn't a resolution.  I responded that I wouldn't be paying for something I never received.  He then, with an attitude said ""well what do you want me to do?"" As if none of this was his fault. I told him to go get his manager.  After waiting another 15 minutes the manager arrived, again insisting to just give m the food in a to-go box.  Again I declined.  By now I am so annoyed and frustrated, I don't want your food.   He questioned who brought us our food. I refused to tell him, because it wasn't their fault.  His kitchen didn't make the food and his waiter never checked on us.  He then stated he would take the salad off of the bill.  Not once was I offered anything for my inconvenience. I shouldn't have paid a thing for my bowl of soup and drink.  Poor service, lazy waiters and horrible management. I travel and eat out very often.  I have never had my food not arrive.  I have had the wrong meal, overcooked food and cold food, but never this.

137,Nick P.,"Elk Grove, CA",27,15,6.0,2.0,2016-03-23,"Let me preface this horror story with the fact that both the server (Yanni) and manager (Amy) were great.  Here goes... So my wife and I decided to treat my dad and mom to dinner.  We decided on BJs as our place to go.  When we first arrived, the wait was minimal; only 15-20 minutes to be seated.   Once we were seated, we waited a few for our server to show up; nothing too terrible, but not on-the-spot either as it was a busy night.  Once he showed up, we ordered our drinks as well as an appetizer and off he went.  This is where things started to go downhill.  He comes back with our drinks and takes our order:  Two steak dinners, a pasta/chicken dish and a personal pizza.  With that, he was off again.   My wife's soup came out first which we assumed was coming with the meal...  well before the appetizer.  After about 20 minutes we got a hold of him again and asked where our appetizer was.  He apologized profusely and explained that the kitchen was running behind and that he'd check to see where it was.  After about a total wait of 30 minutes, our appetizer arrives.  It's hot and delicious and we are ravenous at this point so it's devoured pretty quickly. So we continue to wait, and wait, and wait for our main dishes to be served with no avail.  After about 50 minutes I finally ask our server what's up with our meals.  He again apologizes for the wait and offers to refill our chips in the mean time.  We continue to wait for our entrees and our chips at this point.   After about 65 minutes our entrees come out.  My steak is cool and well done when I had asked for medium, and my father's steaks is cool, the asparagus is undercooked, and my dad's baked potato is cold and hard.  My mother's pasta dish and my wife's pizza are fine however.  At this point, I complain to our server explaining that the long wait and the condition of our food is uncalled for.  He says that he understands and that he'd get the manager. I talk to the manager and she acknowledges that there's no reason for this and that she would take care of our meal.   So all-in-all the food was terrible, the wait was terrible, but the staff was great working with what they have.  Which was the only thing saving this review from being a 1 star.  I wouldn't recommend going here until they work their kitchen out unless you like terrible food, and long waits with a smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=120,2.4,2.72,2.828,2.3760000000000003,2.592

I know if you are a regular patron of BJ's one bad review won't stop you from returning, however I was a regular at this particular BJ's and as of tonight I will NEVER go back. First off service was slow, not a big deal it always is. But I ordered the seared ahi salad, something I get all the time. It was inedible, the lettuce had turned and was slimy, the tuna was decent and I made the mistake of telling the waiter that. It basically negated the fact that they served me expired disgusting salad. They took so long to get us our food that by the time we had to wait and wait and wait for our bill I had to leave my husband and son there to get our eight month old home to bed. When my husband got home he explained that they did take 50% off my salad and the manager told him that it was because ""I liked the tuna so much"" Now let me make this clear I didn't intend for them to discount the bill at all, but the fact that the cheap manager attempted to recoup her loss by saying I raved about the tuna was a bold lie. It was the only edible potion of my dinner and we had just left baseball practice, I was starving I would have eaten bark! This was an awful experience from the service of the staff, manager, and the food was absolutely revolting! I know this will not deter the average person going to a chain restaurant that they go to all the time or expect to get typical BJ's food, but if this even opens they eyes of the management at that location this review has done its job.

235,Al S.,"Diamond Springs, CA",864,112,587.0,4.0,2016-06-03,I have eaten here many times and after eating here just two nights ago I knew I had to write a review. Not every BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the same. I like this eatery because the staff is always engaged with you as the customer even when they are busy to inform you of where you at on their waiting list to get a table. The servers are always proactively taking care of their customers needs and the manger whose name is Joe is fantastic. The food is always presented very well and if they make any mistakes on an order they are quick to make sure it is taken care of immediately I also appreciate that they keep their rest rooms clean and the entire restaurant is maintained quite well. My only criticism is the parking can be quite challenging especially on a busy evening.

What we expected where large onion rings, what we received were these skinny, spaghetti looking onion strips that were similar to what you put on a Thanksgiving green bean casserole. I had to use a fork to pick these up. My husband ordered a beef dish which came with a baked potato and asparagus. For some reason they put all this food on a plate so small that the asparagus hung from the side of the plate on to the table and the meat was so small, about a 2"" by 4"" piece. I'm thinking the reason for the small plate was to make the meat look bigger. We asked the waiter for a larger plate as it looked like his food might fall on the table. The waiter just brought us another place of the same size for my husband to divide his food onto to plates. Ridiculous!  My daughter ordered the macaroni and cheese. It was so dry with very little cheese sauce. I could have made a better version of it at home. I was disappointed by the overall quality of the food, specially at those prices.

Not sure how long the rice was cooked for but it would have made better sense to make mashed potatoes out of it and overall was a bit Bland definitely not worth $19. As for my plate the steak was okay once again the shrimp was a bit bland and perhaps my plate sat out for a bit because my steamed vegetables came cold and my mashed potatoes look like they add sad for a little while.

I ordered the rib eye with a house salad with ranch and a baked potato. The salad came out and it was a mixture of ranch and balsamic vinegar so they messed up and instead of making me a fresh one they drenched my salad with ranch. Which tasted nasty because the balsamic dressing was super sweet. My steak came out and it was practically mooing at me to the point that the waitress was surprised herself. The potato had nothing. No butter, sour cream or chives. So disappointing. Then I told two of the waiters that it was my sons birthday and wanted to surprise him with a pizuki it never came out which sucked because we were with all of my husbands family and it would of been super special. Then when the check came out I let them know it was separate checks and that number 1 was a rewards account. Well that didn't happen until the 3 time around granted we ended up getting $14 off instead of $10 but still it was such a hassle. I'm not quite sure what happened but I was so disappointed.

I asked the waitress lots of questions to try to decide what to order. She gave me her opinion so I ordered the thin crust pizza. The menu described the pizza differently than it is actually made. I ordered a thin crust pizza and it was crispy on the very edges but the rest was greasy and mushy. I hate to blame the waitress, she was just giving her opinion. It's my fault that I ordered what I did. I guess she likes mushy pizza but it was pretty gross. Then the manager (I assume that's who he was), came over to offer to get me something else. My family was half done eating by then and we didn't have all day to wait for them to make something else. So I told the manager we didn't have time to wait but he didn't offer to even comp my pizza.

Our server fixed the problem and did whatever he could to make us happy by getting us a new pizza even though we had already killed about half the pizza. We were pretty stuffed so we took the left over pizza home. The next day I warmed up the left over pizza and after eating a few bites I found a piece of blue plastic on a piece of the chicken. It looks like it came from plastic packaging or something that packaged cheese usually comes in.

First, I order pick up around 10:15 pm this Saturday. I just ordered boneless buffalo wings with an extra side of garlic parm sauce and three sides of ranch. I show up and what looks like a manager says hi and I say I'm here to pick up a Togo order and he tells me to wait. Why wouldn't you let me know it would be a second when I acknowledge you? I tell him I'll be back and I have to use the restroom. Mind you, I'm coming home from work which includes a two hour drive. I just want to food I pre-ordered and I want to go home. I finish using the restroom... no one is there. I wait. My food finally comes and I pay. I check my food... no ranch... no extra sauce. So, I asked the manager and he goes and grabs it. I realized I didn't reask again for my extra sauce. While I'm waiting for my ranch to arrive... I ask a girl for the sauce. She barely looks up from her phone and tells me she'll let him know. Uh?? He hands me the ranch and tells me he has to get the phone. I get it... he's the ONLY ONE WORKING!! I wait for five minutes while a guy has his back to me counting money, the girl is on her phone and three other employees made eye contact with me... including a general manager. Finally... I'm pissed. I wanted hot food. Finally I go to the hostess desk where the general manager is standing and ask for my extra sauce... AGAIN since one of the three employees I've asked could give it to me and the girl is busy on the phone. I automatically get corrected that she is clocked out. Like this all has to be a fucking joke. How can any paying customer sit there like that and be ignored. I don't care if you're clocked out or not, it's so tacky and unprofessional top sit on your phone like that especially when I've asked for help. Her and the employee that was counting money for an entire 5 minutes then begin to talk about how she's off and waiting for food, right? Like I'm an asshole because I've been waiting for something I asked for when I placed my order 40 minutes ago. Like I'm a dick for being ignored and this chick sitting on the phone. So, I said... I don't care if you're off or not, it's tacky. She then proceeds to argue with me. Like no. At this point, I'm done. No one offered me an apology, nothing. I eat there about 1-2x a week.

BJ's sounded good, so we decided to head over to the Roseville location. We arrived about 7 PM on a Tuesday night. It looked busy as usual, but the wait time was not that bad... probably about 10 minutes. We were a party of 6, and got seated at a table that was pretty small for 6 people, and squished between two booths. The table was so wobbly that we had to actually keep putting our beverage napkins under the legs of the table...otherwise we would have undoubtedly spilled the beverages - it was that bad.  Our waiter was nice enough... he took our drink orders promptly. We then ordered our food and waited for about 35 minutes for it to come. Some other waitress came by and delivered one plate of food. We thought she was coming back with the rest, but we were incorrect. Another five minutes went by, and one more plate of food came. Now, out of the six of us, two of us had food. Again, we waited about another 3 to 5 minutes...finally, everyone had their food.  When the food arrived, I reminded the waiter about my house salad, and he said ""oh it never came?"" I told him that it had not come, and to just forget about it and take it off the bill. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos - they had a pretty good flavor, but when I ordered it, I had asked for new onions... there were a few onions on them, but I was so hungry I just didn't care anymore.  They were pretty good, but unfortunately the pita bread rips as you try to pick it up, so you end up eating the tacos with a fork.

Joshua C. was my server tonight and he was the second most amazing server I've had in my life. He was very super nice and dealt with issues we had in a very professional manner. The table behind us complained about their food twice and wanted to see the manager. Joshua was very apologetic and understanding and again was very professional. Did not give attitude at all! Unfortunately that's where the 5 star reviews end. The food was not very good. We did the Party for 2 deal. That comes with your choice of either a soup or salad, a medium sized tavern or deep dish pizza, and a full sized pizookie for dessert. We also ordered the salmon with quinoa dish. We went with clam chowder for the soup. When it arrived, it looked appetizing because they had a generous amount of clams in it! I took a sip and it was very very salty. I would say to the point where I would say it's inedible because I did not touch the soup again after that. But my boyfriend continued to go at it! Eventually he did stop after finishing about half of it.  Next up, we ordered the deep dish pizza: half great white and half bj's favorite. Again, upon arrival it looked good. The bf and I each picked up a slice and put it on our plate. Both our slices were very greasy on the bottom. Because it was so greasy, the bottom was very soggy. The weird thing was that it was only greasy for his half of the pizza (bj's favorite). My guess is that there were too many toppings. The bf brought it to the attention of our server and he offered to bring it back to the kitchen and have it in the oven for a little longer. But I said there was no need as the pizza was still edible. The third person at our table ordered the salmon with quinoa entree. I am not a fan of quinoa at all so I didn't take a bite to try it. He didn't like the quinoa but the salmon was cooked well. Thought it could've been glazed a little longer, but overall it was good. Finally, for dessert we got a salted caramel pizookie. I've never tried this flavor before but the other two at the table wanted to try it so I kept an open mind. Being a pizookie eating veteran, I must say this was cooked perfectly! When it's overcooked, it's very hard to get the cookie to come off of the pan. Definitely wasn't the case here. For those of you who have never tried the salted caramel pizookie, its a chocolate chip cookie with bits of caramel in it. They drizzle the cookie with caramel sauce and top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is again drizzled with caramel sauce and also topped with mini chocolate chips. They were also very generous with the size of the scoop of vanilla ice cream. I probably won't be back to this location unless I only wanted a pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville,2.68,2.47,2.692,2.536,2.5540000000000003

The server was great and did everything she could to create a pleasant experience for us. However, the food was not good at all. The broccoli's were soaked in the pasta sauce indicating the dish were prepared way too long before it hit our table and pasta was cold too. Two of the family members ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and surprisingly the two dishes were prepared quite differently. one had very few broccoli's and the other one had much smaller chicken slices that were burned on one side.

My mother gets up to go to the bathroom and a waiter almost mows her down with a child seat in his arms. You would think he would be able to wait a second for her to pass, but instead he pushes his way through no 'excuse me' or ' sorry.' Then our order is mixed up. They bring out the wrong pizza. BJ's ALWAYS serves cold food so as you can guess what I am about to mention is the food was cold. All the meals were cold- fries were cold. Pizza was cold and not completely cooked. The burgers were mixed up- one was ordered medium well and the other medium, but they were switched along with their condiments.  The manager did give us the pizza for free which was nice and new 'warmer' fries were provided. They did honor our birthday with our free pizookie! Those pizookies use to be good back in the day- hit and gooey cookies, but now it is not so. The cookie was overlooked.

It was definitely a contrast to my many experiences. After getting seated by the host and provided information on or server, we were seated for about 10 minutes before the server arrived. Server did not introduce herself, and wasn't sure if she was to cover the table. She proceeded to state she would get our beverage order started. We requested water which took five minutes or so. At this point we elected to order our food. Water was done while waiting on the food order and again waited for server to swing around. Our food order came out correctly and decently timed shortly after the water. Server rarely stopped by to check in on us. Food was hot and properly seasoned. No complaints on the food order which consisted of two soups, medium pizza and a pizookie.  We placed our order for pizookie when the pizza was delivered. Pizookie came out at a reasonable time because we didn't know how long our server was going to take.  Restaurant was clean and decently kept. Food was on point. Wait staff could use a little more attention. Perhaps one of the worst experiences or delays from service here.

147,Alecia V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-10,"I'm a little late in writing this review, but it must be done. I came in here with my family on a Friday night at 11pm. There were eight of us in total. We arrived happy to see the place was empty- as we were all famished. But to our surprise we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. Oh?? Really... hmmm okay. So I'm over here assuming it would end up being a mere 10 minutes max. Nope. Thirty minutes goes by... REMEMBER THIS PLACE IS PRACTICALLY EMPTY. As if things couldn't get any worse, we then see a bunch of hosts and servers at the front stand chatting away- all while there are a bunch of dirty tables that needed cleaning. I was very upset at this point and wanted to talk to a manager but there were no managers in site and I didn't want to ask the already unhelpful host.  A total of forty minutes pass and a manager comes out from the back and asks my sister how long we've been waiting and then apologizes; seeing how empty the restaurant was and knowing it should have NEVER taken that long to be seated. We finally get seated and at this time it's about midnight and it still takes our server TEN MINUTES to greet us and take our drink orders. LIKE REALLY? Not to mention it took our food an additional THIRTY MINUTES to come out. We were the only guests in the restaurant waiting for food mind you. Once our food arrives the server decides to place our bill on the table, not asking us if we needed anything else. Like really? Did we not JUST get our food? So rude. After my experience here I realized why it was so empty on a Friday night. You will never see that at the Elk Grove location. Probably because the service is much better. Needless to say, this restaurant needs a massive amount of polishing; perhaps new servers and new managers since I'm guessing management isn't doing their job since the servers aren't.

107,The-Reviewer T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,27,4.0,2.0,2016-12-29,"Merry B-Lated Christmas Yelpers. So today's stop was at the BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse located in the Galleria Area of Roseville. It was dinner time, and as I might say. it was a very packed house for a Wednesday. As we entered the establishment, the waiting lobby was quite crowded, we had spoke with the hostess of getting a table ready which we were greeted and given a wait time...... Wait time.... 45 min.- 1 hour ... Well we expected it be a long wait time given the busy day. So we decided to head out to the Bar area to grab some drinks , and well that area was too crowded. Luckily we found an opening at the bar so we ordered the brewery beer called the (Blonde) very light beer, close to I would say an ""Blue Moon"" very good and tasteful, Also it was happy hour on there appetizers so ordered some of there Calamari and A side of there Artichoke Dip & Chips, which I both recommend trying. But wait... what happened to our wait time for our table, so we decided to check up on the front desk on the status, how long should we wait til we got our table.... and Wow !! Big time they dropped the ball, they somehow lost our names and contacts .. and what made it worst, they told us, we had to wait another 2 hours. Big time failure in service hostess, no resolution, not even an apology. And what also I noticed, was that after we heard our names and contacts was not dotted down for a tables, other patrons were getting concerned, and I believe 1 or 2 others names were somehow missed. This was big failure for this establishment, The reason why I gave a 2 stars are the bartenders at the bar. The ambiance was very positive and including there service was on point, But as for the hostess at the front desk, I recommend some more training or yet worst , some extensive customer service, instead of talking to there co-workers about there day of shopping or on social media......Off to Dave & Busters....just got informed it's only a 5 min wait, and plus they've just informed me when I get there my table would be waiting...

We didn't get seated for over an hour and a half - twice the amount of time we were quoted. While we were waiting, we saw an old friend who was on his way out of the restaurant, and he warned us about the wait time. They were quoted the same 30-45 minutes, and their wait was closer to 90 minutes. Yikes.  Once we were seated, our server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was doing an OK job. The food (the only saving grace) was good, but I agree that the portion sizing was off.

We have the mobile app and checked in, so we presumably wouldn't have to wait long, since it was Saturday night. When we talked with the people up front were rude, we asked how long to wait would be the we checked in already they said 30min even with the app.. okay...... so we decided wasn't worth the trouble and started back for the car just to get a text not even 5 min later that our table was ready... really?... We should have left that was only the start of our awful experience... we got seated, server took forever but was friendly place was packed so I get it. We ordered drinks, app and meals at the same time because we knew it was going to be awhile. Food was okay but not great mine was horrible. Do not order the Peta shrimp Tacos. They come with arugula and a vinaigrette. It was so drenched with the dressing that it tasted like straight vinegar. Gross.. son was happy though and that's why we came here. We were finishing up, ordered the kiddos birthday desert. When our server who had just bussed the table next to ours spilled 3-4 drinks directly onto our table and all over my son he almost hit my 6 year old in the face other the glasses some landed in his lap, if the server had not deflected one of them onto me. My son would have been hit in the face with a heavy glass. Seriously?? Other then helping us dry off. I was soaked my whole left side was. My poor son had soda in his hair, all the way to his socks. Other then helping us dry off no refund was offered. Never even had a manager come over. Your server just dumped a whole tray of drinks on your guests. On a little kid out for his birthday.

4,Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356.0,3.0,2017-05-02,"We decided to give BJ's in Roseville a try this past Sunday morning. My wife and I had plans that involved eating .. mid-afternoon .. so we were looking for a light, early lunch. Based on past experience with the Elk Grove location and others, we thought BJ's fit the bill. We even had a pretty good idea of what we wanted to order. The first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant was how empty it was. On the same day of the week and hour of day, the Elk Grove and Folsom locations were generally already busy. You would find lots of people at tables and at the bar. We had plenty of seating choices in Roseville that day and we opted for a spot in the bar area at a comfortable table. I ordered a glass of wine (Estancia Cab), the Seared Ahi Salad and Chicken Tortilla soup. The service was really good. Our server was on top of things, no waiting - no mistakes. Friendly & professional.  The food was fine. My salad was ""good"" but I did not get as much Ahi Tuna as I am used to getting in this meal at a BJ's - not sure why. It was tasty and the rice wine vinaigrette and kick of wasabi again made this one of my favorites.  The soup was, ""good"" as well but I was surprised that the ingredients were not mixed in with the broth at our table. I guess I just missed the ""food prep production"" - obviously not a big deal and no impact on taste - just my attitude I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville,3.52,2.98,2.8,2.0920000000000005,3.196
36,Stephanie D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",56,5,3.0,1.0,2017-05-05,"Let me preference by saying that BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. However, this location is one that I will now avoid.  They weren't the busiest I've ever seen but the host and waitress we talked to sure acted like it. They seemed to not want to be bothered by us. The host gave away tables to 4 other walk in parties that came in after us before our party of 2 was seated. The waitress gave off an annoyed vibe, any questions we had she made us feel like we shouldn't ask. It felt like she just wanted us out of there. She never asked how we liked the food, never checked on us, and never got us refills. We had to ask a different waiter who was actually nice.  To top off everything, they got rid of one of my favorites, the sriracha chicken bacon mac n cheese pasta favorite. The BJs in Folsom still puts something similar together upon request but not this location.  I've never wanted to get out of a BJs restaurant faster and will not be returning to this one. I wish I remembered the names of the host and waitress but unfortunately I was too uncomfortable to ask our waitress her name again.   And hey, I get it, I get having a bad day or being stressed at work, I'm in the customer service industry too and it's rough some days. But you really have to just pull through and act to make other customers/clients comfortable and feel like they enjoyed what service they received.

I absolutely enjoy the deep dish pizzas from BJ's restaurant and am not speaking on the quality or taste of the food, but rather on the customer service.  It was later in the evening, around 8:45-9 at night when I stopped in with a friend to grab a late dinner.  There was no one in line at the host stand but I proceeded to wait several minutes for the two hostesses (who were directly facing us and could clearly see we were there waiting) continued to have an entire conversation before helping us.  It was the rudest experience I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  The looks up and down from the two females was enough for me to turn around and walk out of the restaurant.  Clearly, my patronage was not wanted there and the fact that I couldn't even be acknowledged until two teenagers finished their conversation, while on the clock, is ridiculous.  I will never return here.  I will make sure to tell anyone to not enjoy a meal here due to the service.  And that is just the beginning.  Anyways, won't come back.  Wish I could give negative stars...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville,3.08,2.98,2.74,2.148,3.0200000000000005
42,John C.,"Magalia, CA",12,35,4.0,4.0,2017-06-14,"We have been to this location several times and have always walked away enjoying their food.  Their avocado egg rolls are one of our favorite appetizers anywhere. We've had the same kind of dish at other places but it's never the same. From the crispy outside to the gooey delicious inside, the dipping sauce is amazing too! A must try. I've had their brisket burger and enjoyed it's size/flavor and a bit of a uniqueness. However I'm not the biggest on burgers from restaurants. But if you are give them smokey BBQ goodness a try. The Ahi tuna salad is the latest dish I've tried and loved. The freshness and flavor of the seared Ahi and the vinaigrette blend beautifully. They have little dots of wasabi on the side to help give it that extra delicious kick as well. My only issue is the overall size, was want just a tad bit more or something extra with it.  Finally the signature dish, the Pizookie. This dessert is pretty simple. A large fresh baked cookie in the still warm pan topped with ice cream. We typically get the salted Carmel one and it is to die for! It's just the right size for the wife & I to share after our meals. We have had some slightly slow service from the staff in the past, with either forgetting a to go box or drink refills. As well as receiving a dish without part of the dish(bacon was left out of a pasta dish)  so I have a few reasons to dock them one star.

I will start with, we will never return to this specific BJ's based on repeated poor experience. There were 2 of us.  We ordered ice waters (it was 109 outside), garlic knots and an appetizer sampler to share. That was it.  It took roughly 40 minutes to bring out.  This as we watched two other tables seated after us get their entree's.    But hey, that is okay because it is hot outside, so we hang in until some food runners deliver both the garlic knots and the appetizer sampler. Garlic Knots -- crispy on the outside, like stale crispy or sitting under a heat lamp too long.  These are rolls mind you, and not croutons. Appetizer Sampler -- the plate was super HOT, but the appetizer's not so much.  The buffalo boneless chicken nuggets were room temp, not even warm; the cheese sticks the same -- not even warm; the artichoke/spinach dip was warm at the bottom and cold on top; the avocado egg rolls were inedible.  The avocado was almost black, and I am guessing they were ready for awhile and were ruined from sitting under a heat lamp.   I am not sure what happened, or why it took 40 minutes to bring out cold food, room temp at best that you could tell had been ready for quite some time but the fact they are willing to serve food like that was more of the issue.  We ended up not eating it, besides sampling each thing (none of which were appetizing).  Management took it all off our bill, and we walked next door and got a nice piping hot Smashburger and shared some fries. The one star is the culmination of 4-5 visits gone wrong.  If I could give the server 5 stars by herself I would, she was attentive, kind, apologetic and totally not responsible for whatever was going on in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville,2.92,2.98,2.736,2.148,2.956

I was meeting a friend here to have dinner and catch up since. My friend doesn't get there till about 6 min after me and we sit and talk that we started noticing that our waiter hasn't come around for a long time since she came in. Possibly cause it's a Saturday night I suppose. We order a shrimp asparagus penne pasta and my friend orders a sirloin steak with a few cocktail drinks in the mean time. The drinks were delicious! I got a paradise mule and my friend got the Alabama sunset.  The penne I ordered was SUPER soggy. There was no asparagus (my favorite part :[ ) , and the sauce did not taste okay. Maybe it expired? Idk. It got to the point where I could not stand it anymore and I just stopped eating completely. I didn't want to make it a huge deal so I just tried to toughen it out bc our servers kept changing and at this point I barely saw them come by (it was about 11:30pm). My friend ordered her steak medium rare, but after a few bites she just thought it was dry overall and couldn't finish either. Bj's had a buy one get one free entree deal that was posted on their website specifically for that day. The waitress wasn't aware of that I guess and questioned us, but we just pulled up the deal on the website. No big deal. The service was meh, not too much help as other restaurant locations but still decent. Not going to be harsh cause it was a busy Saturday night. The cooking however was just not good that night.

We started out ordered drinks, an appetizer and our food. The app comes out and it has no bacon, the potato skins are cold and so the waiter offers to bring out bacon on the side which came out about 10 minutes later and was all soft not the way it normally comes out. The food finally came out and the spaghetti which is usually pretty good tasted like it had been left under the light for too long, as it has gotten kind of chewy. The service was not very good either... had to ask for sides several different times, had to wait about 30 minutes for a refill. Seemed standard for the night as the table next to us was complaining to the manager as we were waiting for our orders to get corrected. Won't be coming back here.

87,Chris H.,"Manteca, CA",0,94,125.0,5.0,2017-09-21,after my experience here its only fair to write a review. we had a bday party for my mom at this place last sunday. I called a couple days ahead of the even to book a party for 20 people. that went really smooth and was effortless to be honest. we showed up a half hour early to check in and I had brought a cake that I got from safeway and asked if they could keep in the fridge for me and bring it out at the end of our meal. they did it without any hesitation. and to be honest was suprising it was so easy to do this considering there usually is a charge for this sort of thing. we got seated and as the people started to show up they just had to state they had a reservation for our party and they were walked right in to our section. our server was on top of everything. as people in the party started to trickle in they were on top of our drinks and was ready to take our orders once our party was all there. it was prob 20 min before everyone showed up and the server was extremely patient for us. we ordered our drinks and food and everything came fast. we had some issues with the food. complained about it and they were quick to fix or replace or just take it off the check. when the meal was almost over here comes the cake without me having to remind them. I brought candles for it and was going to put them on once the cake came out but they were ahead of the game and came out with their own candles on it and lit them for me. would of been nice if they sang happy bday so I wouldn't have to haha but it was just an awesome expiereince. I got an email to review my experience so I complained about the food but praised everything else and I got contacted by the manager. this company went above and beyond in my book and I am very satisfied with how everything was handled and how it turned out. so thank you very much!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=80,2.84,2.97,2.668,2.58,2.918

I can understand the twenty minutes wait to be seated but having to wait over an hour to receive our food is ridiculous. I understand on a Sunday night you're pretty busy but over an hour?!? And then when we got the food it was like it came from two different kitchens. The exact same meal was ordered, just different side dishes.  One steak came out perfect and the other was cooked unevenly. One order of green beans was perfect and the other order of green beans was like the bottom of the bowl or something, way too greasy, and over seasoned. The cous cous mac and cheese was pretty good but it was about half of the usual order. We will go back again but we'll stick with our favorite pork chops, which are always excellent.

When we arrived the host said there was plenty of room in the bar section to seat ourselves at a high top. We felt a little dumb doing two laps around the bar section to find zero empty seats. We decided to just wait for a booth.  When we got seated our waitress Casper (Yes, like the ghost) was a joy! She was so friendly and patient. She has one of the best personalities and attitudes I've seen on a waitress.  The main reason for my three stars is because of our food. We didn't order entrees, just the appetizer combo platter. When the appetizers arrived we were missing three of the foods. The random server plopped the food down and walked away with the most unpleasant look on her face. She didn't ask if we needed anything else. She didn't notice the missing items on the platter???? Also, we asked for the BBQ sauce on the side of the chicken, they were very similar to chicken nuggets. The avocado rolls were amazing though!  Casper came over right away and brought us the missing items. Thank you, Casper for making our night.

On to the food.  The avocado egg rolls had a bitter taste to them, unlike the many times we had eaten them in the past.  Even doused in the dipping sauce, they were inedible.  The pizza, spicy Hawaiian Chicken, was bland and didn't contain any discernible applewood smoked bacon as stated in the menu description.  Even their famed Pazookie was a disappointment--the cookie was raw.  By this time my stomach was not feeling well at all.  We didn't even finish half of our food.  We all ended up having gastrointestinal issues.  Total waste of $60 and a few hours of our time.  We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville?start=20,2.56,2.92,2.664,,2.7760000000000002

2,Cute F.,"Sacramento, CA",3,152,8.0,2.0,2017-12-19,To say that their food is mediocre is very kind. I ordered two appetizers the lettuce wraps and the BJ's meatballs. The meatballs were good but the gravy was too sick and fully coagulated when it arrived to my table so the lukewarmness and the stiff gravy was not appealing. The lettuce wraps were good although the portion of chicken was too small compared to the amount of lettuce you received. At 11.25 was pretty steep for being less then a chicken breast full of meat.  My son ordered the prime rib sandwich and I ordered the root beer glazed ribs. Both were a disaster and painfully sweet especially the root beer ribs... and I don't know how Au jus could ever be sweet  but the shifts at BJ's achieved it! . The side dish for the root beer ribs was a nasty Sriracha coleslaw... it was not for human consumption. I felt really bad when I had to tell the server that we would not be coming back even though we had great service and she tried to get us to join the rewards program. There is nothing rewarding about going here and I don't want to endure this kind of food again. They need to take a field trip up to Chico to the Sierra Nevada brewery to find out how to do food.... and quite frankly they could get some beer pointers too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-roseville,2.48,2.82,2.672,,2.684

Still a good choice in our local franchise restaurants. Being a franchise ensures that the menu and service will stay consistent in this trendy restaurant. Tonight was no exception. Our reservations we're for 5 p.m. and we were seated promptly upon our arrival. Tonight's server was Nikki. She was friendly, professional, kept our drinks replenished, and give us plenty of time to make our menu selections. We took our time with the abundance of menu items. Also changing our minds on our selections. Not a problem for Nikki. Nicki never forgot us and correctly took care of everybody's requests. That's no easy task in my family. We spent 3 hours with dinner and conversation and never felt rushed to leave.  This evening we ordered 2 Classic ribeye dinners. You have your choice from a plethora of sides. They chose baked potato, asparagus, and honey Sriracha brussel sprouts. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts, sweet, spicy, and delicious. One order of double bone-in pork chop with mashed potatoes and asparagus. One order of Mediterranean Pita tacos and one of shrimp arugula Pita tacos.  The taco dishes come with unique side dish called seasonal Bistro grains. This tasty side dish is a combination of roasted sweet peppers, red onion, and corn. Then married with tasty spices, quinoa, farro, and black beans. We felt this dish was over salted. The Bistro grains is served cold, but I prefer to have it warmed. Which BJ's took care of for me.  Tonight for dessert, 3 orders of the always popular Pizookie.  This treat is your choice of cookie baked in a pie tin. Then topped with a scoop of ice cream. You can order this delight in full or mini sizes. Yum Tonight's pluses, service service service, cleanliness/consistency, steaks cooked to perfection, honey Sriracha brussel sprouts, Pizookie. Manager checked in on our table.  Tonight's minuses, over-salted seasonal Bistro grains, over roasted (limp) asparagus, tile floor near entrance, decaffeinated coffee that tastes like battery acid. No longer brew their own beers. BJ's is trendy, popular, crowded, and noisy. Having said that it's well maintained with clean bathrooms and we'll staffed. They have a full sized bar with a large assortment of beers. Although they no longer brew them at this location. Note of caution the tile floors at the entrance are extremely slippery.
