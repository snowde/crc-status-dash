142,John B.,"Round Rock, TX",86,260,89.0,4.0,2012-06-27,"The family went by the new BJ's in Round Rock, and we had a good time. If you have ever been to BJ's, well, this one is just like the others.  Clean, nicely decorated, TV's everywhere and cool rock-n-roll music playing.  The menu is HUGE, and takes a while to read.  You can get pasta, chicken, steak, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, fish, pork... pretty much anything your party of picky eaters could want can be accommodated at a BJ's. They didn't seem to be suffering any of the opening week hang ups that most new restaurant locations have.  The staff was well trained, and there appeared to be a 1-1 ratio of trainer to trainee.  I'm looking forward to the 'new' being rubbed off this place, and for the hustle and bustle to die down a little bit.  We were seated by the station where most of the waitstaff hangs out, and we felt a little weird having so many people rushing around us all the time. I had the calzone w/ mushroom, pepperoni, and Italian sausage.  The ricotta cheese was very nice and balanced the spicy/salty meats.  I wish I had added a side salad, but after the calzone and splitting a pizooki trio with my family I was full without being stuffed. I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=180,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997
289,Theresa T.,"Round Rock, TX",37,10,,2.0,2012-07-02,"Based on the food, I would give them 5 stars. We orderd the new thai salad, deep dish pizza, stuffed mushrooms, tortilla soup, dessert and two drinks. The service was very slow for a Monday night and then our drinks were spilled on us. It took us about a half hour or longer to actually get our drinks. Plus I had a stain in my shirt when I got home from the drink being spilled on us. I know accidents happened, but the least they could have done was compensated our drinks and an apology from the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=280,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
146,Taintpretty M.,"Round Rock, TX",3,50,6.0,4.0,2012-07-06,"For being their opening week we had a very good time here. The menu is a bit over the top with the number of items. I wish they had a specialty they did very well instead trying to cover all the bases. We had a couple of appetizers of the white pizza and fried artichokes. Both were very good and discounted for happy hour.  I did order a flight of beers and this was better than expected. One plus of this being a chain is that they had skilled brewers running things and it wasn't as scary as ordering beer from Flix (which still has not gotten down their brewing). The Tatonka was creamy good! At BJs they put a guide down on your table and then sit the beer in a designated spot so you will know what beer you are drinking. The new waitress got every one wrong. Luckily one of the trainers saw it and she straightened it all out and added two more. No complaints there when they catch a mistake and correct it with more beer! Even though the parking lot was completely full there was only a 15 minute wait. We ended up passing on the table and stayed at a small bar table. Had a great time talking to others at the bar.  We did notice the Westside Alehouse when we left and they had maybe 15 cars in the lot. Night and day on these two places. One with awful lighting, crappy food, clueless waitresses, and awful ambiance and then the other that has their act together in the first week. We tried Westside but you failed us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=180,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
246,Stacey T.,"Round Rock, TX",75,105,186.0,4.0,2012-07-07,"I'm not one to go to a new facility that has just opened.  In past experiences, I get nothing but bad service.  I'm giving 4 stars not because it was WONDERFUL service - it was GOOD service; however, the food and beer was excellent and the waiter & waitress that we had tried their very best to give us a great experience.  And really, that's all that matters when it comes to a restaurant - especially a new one.   So my friends and I (3 in all) went here on a Thursday night around 8:30.  It was jam packed, and of course, this was to be expected.  So we get our little buzzer thingie and then head over to the bar.  They had a TON of beer to choose from on tap and we were able to get samples before purchasing.  The bar tender (she) had a slight attitude with the 3 of us for some reason (maybe the samples?) but we got our beer finally and talked a few minutes before our buzzer went off.  All of what I just said happened was about 30 minutes total.  We get to our nice big booth and get waited on immediately.  Our waiter knew the menu pretty well; however, as far as how certain items tasted, he wasn't able to tell us.  He explained that the management didn't have the employees try all of the food - only SEE the food during training.  Hmmm, ok, well we ended up with the stuffed mushrooms, crusted chicken parmesan, some kind of soup bread bowl, and I got the southwestern spring rolls (which were da bomb!)  Yes, I just said that.  Throughout our meal, the service was a bit slow, but as I said before, they tried and that's all that mattered.   Overall the food was good.  The beer was good.  The atmosphere was a tad bit on the noisy side but it didn't hinder our conversation so hence the 4 stars.  I'll be coming back here soon, I'm sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=160,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

Our waitress was friendly and made our dinning experience wonderful.  I went with the Brewhouse Blonde Fish 'N Chips and a few Brewhouse Blonde beer to go with it. The batter was crispy and delicious, my chips were thick cut seasoned potatoes and my beer was delicious. My wife had a Mahi mahi and shrimp dish that she thoroughly enjoyed. Daughter 1 had a Flatbread pizza an daughter 2 had a deep dish pasta that they both really liked. We also had an appetizer of calamari which could of been more crispy but tasted good.

Took 30 minutes to get our meal and waitress forgot my mom's request for a differnet salad dressing. Finally went up to the hostess stand and asked for a manager and told him how long we had been waiting for our food and that we couldn't find our waitress. He went over to our table where our food was finally getting delivered and asked us what we needed, brought my request for cheese for my salad and left. Never came back and he didn't take care of anything on the bill, not even my mom's small side salad that took at least 15 minute to get the dressing, nor did he offer dessert on them. Nothing, nothing to try to gain back our confidence.  As for the food, my main complaint is that everything fried had to be frozen and oh my, the prices. $7.95 for a ""giant"" baked potato wIth butter and sour cream. Giant guys mean large baked potato.

BF had a cider and I had one of their limited edition beers. Both were decent. We had the watermelon and feta salad to share. This was simple and tasty.  The drinks and salad came out fairly quickly. This was not the case for the entrees. Not sure what the holdup was but the waitress came by a half dozen times to say she expected them out at any time. We even had a visit from the manager to tell us the same thing. Mind you, we never complained to anyone that it was taking too long, but they must have been able to tell things were delayed. When we did get our meals, my entree, the Hawaiian Mahi was lukewarm. I like my fish to be piping hot on my plate. BF had the Ahi tuna salad. My thought was they cooked my meal and forgot his and mine was left to cool off while his was cooking. Wish they would have put it back on the grill because it was slightly underdone. This is no fault of our server. She was very attentive maybe too much so. One thing I don't like about BJs Is the number of employees all running around.It seems sort of chaotic.

280,Mandy S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,2012-08-07,"I love BJ's. Just not this one! I'm not one to write restaurant reviews, especially negative ones, but my experience a few weeks ago was just that bad. Strike one:  We arrived at 12:30 for lunch and were told there would be about a 15-20 minute wait. Reasonable, we thought.  About 35 minutes later we were shown to our table.  Strike two: Once finally seated we were looking forward to some lunch as it was now after 1:00. Unfortunately, our hunger would have to wait even longer. We didn't get our food until nearly 2:00! After waiting about 45 minutes our waitress said she had checked on our food and they were just waiting on our kid's cheese pizza. Really? A tiny cheese pizza takes 45 minutes to cook? Glad we didn't order a larger one. So, 5 minutes later they finally bring out our food (all from the appetizer menu or lunch menu... My point, it shouldn't have been anything that would take extra time), well except for the cheese pizza. Luckily, I have the world's most patient four year old, but even she was a little cranky at this point. Wish I could say the food was worth the wait. For four of us it was ""okay"" but the fifth ordered a baked potato that came out hard as a brick. It was sent back and we didn't want to wait any longer so just asked it to be removed from the bill.  The kid's cheese pizza wasn't very good either. I'm sure they purposefully don't serve it piping hot for kids but it should have at least tasted fresh out of the oven. Instead it tasted more like it had just been reheated.  Strike three: No, it doesn't end there. We asked to talk to the manager after our food finally came out and potato was so terrible, and rather than coming by our table immediately in an attempt to resolve the issues, he sent another waitress over offering a free dessert. We had been in this restaurant for nearly two hours at this point. The last thing we wanted to do was wait for more food. When the manager finally did come over, nearly 30 minutes after we made the request, he sounded shocked to hear that weren't satisfied with the service offered. If my daughter hadn't had to go to the restroom we would have already left before he even bothered to show up.  He kept blaming the fact that they were new, and without offering anything more than an empty promise that they'd get better, he actually had the nerve to say he hoped we'd come back soon.  Don't count on that! For the overall reputation of BJ's I hope they do improve, but my family and I won't be revisiting this location to find out. When we need our BJ's fix we'll just visit the others in Austin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=280,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

If you want to go to a restaurant that has a menu that doubles as an epic novel, you have your choice between BJ's and Cheesecake Factory. If you want to add in an outstanding selecting of beer, BJ's takes the cake. You can surely read other reviews regarding BJ's, but frankly, who are these people? This is the only review that matters. If you want to dine at BJ's in the evening, prepare to wait. New restaurants in Round Rock are like the kid's house with the trampoline. No matter how popular/unpopular, everyone is going to show up to check it out. BJ's is worth it, though. Pro-tip: Call ahead. They don't take reservations, but if you want to skim 30 minutes off your wait time, call on the way. Pro-tip 2: They serve the full menu at the bar area. So if you want to skip the wait and you see an open table at the bar, take it and have at it. We skipped the wait a couple times. Pro-tip 3: This place is notorious for over-estimating their wait times. So you may be told 45 minutes, but then be seated in 10. If you're a beer guy (or gal), I recommend doing a custom flight. Since the brew their own, they'll bring you four 4oz pours of any of their 8 (or 9 if they have a seasonal) beers. It's great! For the girls who want something fruity, my wife enjoys their berry cider (yeah, it's got alcohol in it) or their peachy keen sangria something or other. It tasted like liquid jolly ranchers to me, but hey, whatever floats your boat. For the non-drinkers, the home made craft root beer or cream soda is enough to send you into a diabetic coma!

Extensive menu of pretty-good food, full bar with a wide range of private-label beers (for Texas locations, it's contract-brewed by St. Arnold's in Houston), and the capacity to serve enormous numbers of people, in a space well-designed to mitigate the noise that usually accompanies huge crowds. It's a long way from ""quiet,"" but you and your dining companion can hear each other across the table without shouting. It appears from other reviews that this location had plenty of the usual new-restaurant issues to work through, but now that they've been open a couple months, everything is mostly running like clockwork. The wait gets quite long at times, but once you get to the front of the line, service is fast and friendly. The food is on par with other BJ's locations: Better than most chains, but you do need to employ common sense in ordering (don't expect any seafood to have been caught the same day you eat it, or that pasta will be cooked perfectly al dente). As long as you have realistic expectations, BJ's will rarely disappoint. Edit: After a few more visits to this location, I'm upping it to five stars. The kitchen and service at this location are now a little better than other BJ's restaurants I've visited. The management here is definitely doing things right. If the menu and the dining room weren't each so massive, I might even forget it's a chain...momentarily.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=160,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

My food was nice, our server wasn't quite as attentive as I would've liked, my son thought their take on Mac and Cheese was a little too bizarre (chipotle chilis in mac and cheese??). I had a decent tortilla soup and the reduced calorie pork chop. In my dish, the pork chop and golden potatoes were wonderful, but the dish was seriously marred by string beans that tasted like the chef used about 5 times too much black pepper. It was a seriously stupid move that very nearly ruined a very nice dish. My daughter had a very decent fettuccine alfredo.  Still, I'll go back and try more of their food.

My experience this past Sunday 9/2 was so mediocre that I felt compelled to write about it.  The Hostess were over eager but after about a five minute wait we were seated.  Our waiter...well he was just plain awkward.  He did not seem confidant in anything he said or did, and seemed to second guess everything we ordered (maybe it was just an awkward way of parroting back the order to make sure it was correct). The brews are pretty ok and i needed one in order to begin ""reading""  the menu that is large enough to be mistaken for a menu from the cheesecake factory... I settled on the Pot Roast Sandwich.  Very Lack-luster.  I got the impression visually that my entree had been sitting on the pass for a bit.  There were large pieces of celery on the dish that were stringy and hard to eat, and carrots that were not quite cooked.  The pot roast was dry and the gravy was thick and cold. The mash was good but not good enough to save the dish.  All in all I am consistently disappointed and probably will not visit again unless a large group has plans or maybe a happy hour or something.

Needless to say, we both complained about our meals, talked to the manager and ended up trying the salads instead.  The manager himself admitted that my wife's steak was really poor quality.  When he offered to get her another steak, she asked if the new one would be any better, and he said that he couldn't guarantee it.  That alone should have been enough to send us running out the door, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.   I got the Santa Fe salad for $12.50, which was supposed to (per the manager) come with a whole chicken breast sliced over the top of the salad.  Well, all I got was 4 slices of chicken on top (not even half of a chicken breast), and two of the pieces had gristle and tendon on them, which totally grossed me out.  The salad part was mostly the thick, white rind part of the lettuce and there was actually very little greens or good lettuce in the salad.  The rest was filler, a whole bunch of fried, crunchy things for the topping.   My wife ordered the Cobb salad , which ended up costing $15.75 to our amazement!   It was also supposed to contain a whole chicken breast per the manager.  It did not contain anywhere near that much chicken, maybe a half a breast if that.  The rest was the thick, white part of the lettuce that most people just end up throwing away...just totally cheap nasty filler.   At this point we ended up sending the salads back and just getting a refund of our money.   Wait times to get our food were also unacceptable.  Unfortunately we will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=160,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.308,2.76

We tried to go on a weekend night and it was so crowded we did not even bother. We went back at about 4pm on a Monday and enjoyed a mostly empty restaurant. I was afraid it would not be kid friendly, but there were several tables with children. Our waitress was polite, professional, and attentive. the rest of the staff seemed good as well. The entire building was spotlessly clean, and the interior must have cost a fortune with granite table tops everywhere.  The food ranged from ""not bad"" to ""really good."" The calamari was a little overcooked and had obviously been cooked in oil that needed to be changed. My wife had a seared ahi salad that was enormous. Both our kids had chicken fingers which were cooked properly and very tender.  I had the ""jambalaya"" which should have just been called ""New Orleans Style Shrimp and Chicken,"" or maybe even ""Blackened Meat and Veggies over Rice Pilaf.""  Real jambalaya has the rice cooked with the meat, but at least they were accurate in their description of the dish on the menu. I am not complaining BTW, the portion was huge and it was really good. I ate every bite and wanted more. The meats were cooked properly, the shrimp was nice and tender, and the rice balanced out the spiciness. It was hot enough to make my reading time on the toilet interesting tomorrow, but not spicy enough to keep from eating it.  My only major complaint is that the prices are a little higher than most similar places in the area. You will certainly pay more here than you will at Chili's, Le Madelaine, or TGI Fridays. We ended up spending 70 bucks after tip and tax.

292,Cherlynn L.,"Austin, TX",8,40,,2.0,2013-01-26,"Almost every time my husband and I go to this restaurant, we get the wrong order. Last evening (Saturday) I ordered the Thai salmon. That's not what I got. I got the Miso salmon and while there is not much difference, the Thai salmon comes with a mango salsa on top. Mine didn't. I didn't notice at first, then I asked the waitress where the salsa was. She went and got me some. My husband always gets the Maui pork chop and usually it's really good. BJs has gone downhill. The manager came over and acted like it was all just a one time happening. The dinner salad that came with my meal was just iceberg lettuce with two slices of tomoto and one slice of cucumber, and a couple of carrot slivers. CHEAP!! So I asked the manager about how cheap the salads were, and he said he never eats the dinner salads. So I asked about the owner and do they ever listen to customer comments. The manager said and I quote, ""The owner is from San Antonio and is an Aggie!!! That tells you what he's about.""  Wow, usually the manager is professional and not dissing the owner. So we are done with BJs. We go out to dinner a lot and have had other discussions with the manager to let them know what we weren't happy about. I ALWAYS tell the manager I don't want anything free, it's more a discussion of how we as customers feel when things don't go right and hope the comments will go up the chain so that the restaurant gets better, rather than not care. Well we feel BJs doesn't care and we are not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=280,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.088,2.76

Food - I had the Ahi Tuna Salad. I like my tuna to be seared for one instant on both sides, almost sashimi like, otherwise it tastes like canned tuna to me.  I asked the waitress to ask the cooks to do a quick sear, and she even came back to me after placing the order and said ""The kitchen said they can only cook it as they are allowed"" (meaning it can't be completely rare) and I said ""Ok"", expecting half a centimeter to be cooked but when it came out, only a millimeter was seared - PERFECTO. The lettuce was perfectly dressed, there was no excess dressing left on my plate. It was nearly a whole bag's worth of spring greens and NO iceberg or cabbage filler.  I drank a Red Apple (Irish ale + apple cider) with it which perfectly complimented the lightness and fruitiness of the salad.   Waitress was excellent, she was young, only 19, but very mature, attentive, and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=140,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.58,2.84

193,Jessica M.,"Leander, TX",53,12,,1.0,2013-03-04,"I was greatly disappointed by BJ's.  I will think multiple times before I go back.  We started off with plans to go somewhere else, but the wait there was up to a hour and a half.  So, BJ's wasn't far away and we figured we would try it out since their wait was only 15 mins. So, we finally get a table and the waiter comes after about 5 minutes of us sitting there.  He seemed nice at first. I was in a Cajun sort of mood so I thought I'd try the jambalaya, when I asked what he thought of it he said that the only complaint people have is it's spicy.  Okay, I can handle that.  It seemed like the chef just grabbed some seasoning and went to town with the dish.  It was very overpowering. My boyfriend ordered a calzone.  The thing was barely the size of a sandwich.  He was so disappointed that he grabbed a McDonald's burger after we left. Another friend, ordered a burger and fries.  Her fries?  They were cold.   Another friend had the nachos, yeah he wasn't happy either. We were willing to overlook the food, BUT there's several things I've learned in working in the restaurant industry.   ONE: You should never let a customer not have a full glass!   This guy knowing he gave me a spicy dish, was no where to be found and I had nothing to drink!  I was getting pissed. TWO: Once one person finishes their dish because you gave them a tiny calzone, don't ask the whole table about dessert!  That was just stupid, no one was even close to being done. Lastly, once you've given the check, DON'T disappear!  The customers are ready to go!  Well he disappeared and we wanted to give him our money so we could get change and leave.   At this point the restaurant was freezing too.  Here's a tip for the place, once the restaurant clears out, turn the heater up just a tad! So, we ask another waitress to get our waiter for us.  What does she say to us?  ""Who is your waiter?"" After we search the check for his name, we tell her and she says, ""Wow you should learn his name!""  My thoughts?  DUDE!!  The guy actually has to come around for us to remember his name!   Overall... yeah I wasn't impressed.  Oh yeah!  and my boyfriend is a Bud Lite guy.  Period.  None of this fancy stuff they make.  So the waiter insisted he try a sample of their specialty.  When we receive our check, guess what we got charged for?!?!  What does ""sample"" mean to you?  It means a free small portion to me.  Yes it wasn't a large charge, but don't charge us for something we didn't want!  Ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=200,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.116,2.88

In fact, I probably could have just had that side as my lunch and I would have been fully satisfied and full.  The only downside was that it takes a long time. Our lunch was 2.5 hours (the wait was 15-20 minutes). Also the potato skins were a little over fried. I think they dip them into a batter and deep fry them like fries or chicken strips.

167,M K.,"Austin, TX",0,118,2.0,1.0,2013-04-26,"We visited BJ's tonight for the first time.   The place looks very nice and attractive.   The beer selection is huge if you enjoy different types of beers and micro brewery beer.   We were seated after a 30 minute wait on a friday night which was pretty good.   The menu is very diverse but unfortunately the service is a little slow and there were several servers who visited our table and it seems they never communicated with each other.   Our appetizer was a very simple chips & salsa which took forever to arrive.   The main courses were for the most part tasty (3 out of 4 were good, one was  just so so). The most disgusting part of the evening however was when the server brought us 4 small dishes in order to share appetizers.    After eating our appetizer, my son picked up his plate and found raw meat smashed up against the bottom of his plate.    Not only disgusting but completely unsanitary...how on earth does raw meat find its way to getting stuck on the bottom of dishes that are taken out and placed on a table?    We are not talking about a few small specs of ground beef, it was 3 or 4 pieces of raw beef each the size of about a quarter and perhaps twice as thick.   I wrapped it up and gave it to our waitress and told her about it, she was surprised and said she would alert the manager and the manager would come right to our table.   No manager ever arrived...I wonder if she really did anything or go back to find out what the kitchen staff was doing. The other disappointing experience was when my daughter finished her main course.   She picked up her plate to set it aside and felt something rough on the bottom of her plate, I looked under and it was dried on food on the bottom of her plate.   I rubbed my hand across it and the entire bottom of her plate was greasy or oily....it appears they served my daughter her meal on a dirty plate that was not washed. My conclusion about this place is they spent a lot of money on the building, have a few nice menu items, and completely fail when it comes to sanitation, customer service, and management.   We definitely will not be back...our health is more important then the few tasty meals we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=220,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.148,2.68

I love the food, I love the variety of their menu, but  the Round Rock location is a horrible representation of this chain! 1st disappointment: about a month ago - friends that relocated to Denver, were in town for the week and insisted that we go to eat at BJ's as they missed it so much. We ordered 2 appetizers, only one showed up, 20 mins later. When we asked where the second one was, we were told it would be right out. The waiter returned and said there was a problem with our order, but the manager would come talk to us. Which he did, explaining that the conveyor belt in the kitchen was broken and that our dish fell off, so they had to make a new one (In other words, they forgot to put the order in). So, after 30 mins total we finally received our complete order of appetizers. Then our entrees came out, they got 3 out of 4 right! We chopped it up as a loss and hoped that it was just an off night. Last disappointment: Tonight - I figured it was one bad experience, I'd give it another try. BIG MISTAKE! We were seated immediately but waited 15 mins just for 1 beer, which is more than I can say for our appetizer. Again, it never showed up! People that were seated after us were getting their food. When our waiter finally made it back to our table, after being seated for 35 mins now, he told us that our meals would be right out! When we asked about our appetizer, he didn't know where it was. Obviously our food was coming, so we ""cancelled"" it. My meal was mediocre, not hot, kinda warm but I was starving. We were given a ""free"" dessert, which I'm pretty sure wasn't free as they overcharged me for my meal. But at this point a few extra dollars wasn't worth the trouble. I was just ready to get out of there! As much as I loved this place, I will never return to this location, EVER!

I'm giving 2 stars and not one, because the food wasn't bad, however,  the service was horrible!  Got there about 1:30, so the main lunch rush was over, and it wasn't really that busy. Our server was polite, but I should have known that the experience was going to be ""different"" when she asked if any of us had been to BJ's before. Two of us had, but the other one hasn't been to BJ's before. Her comment after that was ""We have good pizza, burgers, and beer, so you will be safe if you order that!"" WHAT???!!!---Or should I say WOW? After ordering drinks, we ordered 2 appetizers, the Pot stickers, and Chips and salsa. Our server stated she would put the order in, and come back to take our order- pretty routine. About 25 minutes later, she returned to take our order. We ordered and inquired about the appetizers. She assured us that they would be out in a minute. Another 10 minutes or so, and the pot stickers came out.(which were tasty, by the way) We asked about the chips and salsa. Her response was, ""oh, do you still want them?"" Ummmmm, yes, we still do, seeing as how we ordered them, and inquired  about them!  2 minutes later our lunch arrived. We all just ate in silence, probably because we were embarrassed for our server, who was noticeably screwing up all of the other table's orders in her section as well.  Needless to say, the chips and salsa never arrived, and it took a whole 25 more minutes to get the ""manager"" to take the appetizer off of the bill.

The avocado rolls were mushy and seemed like it was taken out of the freezer and microwaved. Out of the three things we ordered we struck out on two. The beer was good, but the food needs to catch up in quality with other BJs I have been to. The restaurant was pretty packed for a weekday and the bar area was super busy, so looks like they are doing good business. I hope they do something to improve their quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=220,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.7,2.6

Thinking I would get the same experience here in Austin my boyfriend and I went to the one in round rock. We walked in, sat and ordered a salad, broc and cheddar soup, and five meat medium pizza to share. First off our waitress brought the wedge salad without the soup and said said sorry but we ran out of soup an have to make more it shouldn't be long; it's rude to bring one persons food and not the others. The wedge salad looked pitiful and was unappetizing. The pizza came (still no soup) where I unrolled my silverware to find my fork not just dirty but food still crusted on it disgusting. I told the waitress and she got me another. The pizza wasn't crispy like it was at the other locations. Then came my soup which tasted like it was a powder mix they added water and cheese to. I couldn't eat it. The table next to us had a similar issue with their baked potato; the i guess manager came out saying sorry but we dont have any baked potatoes for you at this time, the ones from lunch are not serve able  and the dinner ones arent ready yet. The dessert was good but it's kind of hard to screw up a cookie. As I was getting up from the table I saw the salt which had black specks all on it-i don't know about you but where I come from salt is white and if there's black stuff it's contaminated. The beer was good, the bar was great, but this location is a bar first and restaurant second. The kitchen and wait staff are lacking which I feel is a product of pour managing!

The website seems to indicate that this is a family friendly place, but our toddler decided to throw a fit as we ordered drinks. He wasn't happy and was crying loudly (is there any other kind?).  I tried entertaining him with the crayons and my phone, but we knew we'd just have to wait it out. He's 2 and he wanted to run around the restaurant instead of sitting still. I can honestly say that the tantrum was worse for US than anyone else in the restaurant and we figured he would calm down once the food arrived.  Just before our waitress took our food order, what I assume was the manager moved her aside and told us that ""this has been disturbing"" and that ""other guests have complained"". Having never been asked to leave a CASUAL, LOUD (from multiple TVs, etc) restaurant before, we were pretty surprised and annoyed. My husband immediately told him we would leave and the manager seemed to back off and offer ice cream or something to keep our kid quiet. Since we don't usually give our kids sugar to shut them up, we weren't interested. Plus, the tone with which he acted about the 'problem' was rude. The problem here was the poor customer service and the lack of sympathy for parents of a screaming toddler.  If we had been yelling at him or otherwise scolding him and creating a scene, I can understand why other patrons would be upset, but we were simply offering him positive choices to stop his behavior and remaining calm in the face of a tantrum.

Pizza was OK for deep dish - a step above Pizza Hut, but the spciy meatball was not special. Wedge salad is what one would expect for a chain - not bad. A few bacon and blue cheese crumbles tossed on top with some bottled dressing. Dessert was a large, warm, macadamia cookie with some ice cream - pretty tasty. Who doesn't like a warm cookie with ice cream? The whole experience was a little lackluster, but folks seem to dig it as the place was packed. B.J.'s seems like a cool concept though for a chain.

Personally I think local business owners and locally sourced food is better and healthier for you. However I will leave that thought out of the review. BJ's specialty is pizza. The prices are on the higher side and it offers a lot of options and could be considered a higher end type of pizza. However the food is just not that great. The attraction is probably the whole package which is beer and pizza in a family type restaurant setting.  There are better options for pizza that cost less money. There are also better options for beer that costs less money. If you want both together then BJ's is a good choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock?start=120,3.36,2.97,2.97,2.636,3.1260000000000003

So impatient. More importantly, the food was disgusting. I ordered a sirloin steak and it was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. It BURNED because it was so salty. So salty the Mormons tried to settle on it. So salty that if you put a snail on it, it would DIE. It was saltier than an actual BJ. Two of my friends ordered pasta and it was still crunchy.

Several times the food has been terribly salty. Service, while the staff is always friendly, the service is VERY slow. VERY... VERY... VERY SLOW.

My first complaint is with the order ahead mobile app. I got an email saying I would get $5 off my bill and a free pzookie for trying it so I thought, why not? Apparently you have to inform the hostess once you scan your rewards card up front that you have pre ordered. I was not aware of this and assumed since you do so via your rewards number online that once the computer checked you in the order would become visible to the server. It didn't. After numerous back and fourth we finally had to repeat our order to the server which defeated the entire purpose of ordering ahead so that the kitchen could start our food once we were seated. I will say, the server was nice enough to still give us our discounts but it was annoying all the same. Cut to tonight. I had a craptastic day at work and happened to have a buy one entree get one free coupon so it seemed like a winner. The server was very sweet and had our drinks, food, even appetizers all promptly out in a flash. So far so good, until she cleared our plates and I showed her the email coupon. She told us she would have a manager right on it. 5 minutes goes by still no check. She's taking drink orders, disappearing, coming back with drinks and food for other tables, and now 10 minutes. No check. Mind you the entire time we are sitting there plates gone and empty drinks. She comes by every 4 minutes to apologize and say the manager hasn't taken care of it yet. 15 minutes of waiting and finally the bill. The entire process to get and pay our bill took longer than it did to order and EAT our food.  I wasn't going to originally say anything about the mobile app experience because it's still new and I get that on the first try there are bound to be kinks. But two times in a row of mishaps was the end of the line for me. The whole point of going out and not cooking at home is to avoid hassle and have a relaxing experience.

He brought us our food and after we where done we sat there for 10 min before anyone came over the clear our plates and the person that cleared them wasn't even him.  Then we sat for another 10 min before he brought over the check. Even when we were eating, not one time did he top off drinks or even ask if the food was ok. I'm sure restaurants get lots of people that try to scam for free deserts, but I'm not one of them. I am not even much of a sugar eater and would have refused the dessert if it was offered. My children just wanted my day to be acknowledged, fun, and special.

So we were really excited about going to BJ's for dinner and drinks last night (11/21/14). I've been one of BJ's ""Premier Rewards"" members since they opened in RR, so I opened the app and added our name to the waitlist before we left the house. We drove up ~10 minutes later,  checked in at the hostess stand where we were told it would be ""about 15 minutes"" until we were seated. So we waited patiently for almost half an hour (listening to a toddler in the lobby shrieking her lungs out) before we were seated...five feet from the lobby. Our waitress then rushed us through the entire meal, while simultaneously getting almost every aspect of it WRONG! My wife got the wrong salad and was told that it was just ""tough for whoever ordered it"" by the waitress.  We both ordered our steaks medium-rare and they were both delivered closer to well-done. And they both came with the wrong sides - who orders mashed AND baked potatoes? I then ordered a sampler of four beers...which NEVER came out. Then the waitress returns, lays down the check and says, ""Still don't want dessert, huh?"" and walks away. Yeah.

They have happily taken back something if we haven't liked it without scoffs or sighs. Great with managing groups. The bar is awesome. Lots of choices of brewed beer. You can't go wrong. I wish they had half pints though. A pint before a burger/pizza/egg roll is too heavy for me.   I am still not a huge fan of the food, most of the stuff is either cheesy or fried. I'd like I see more healthy options. Appetizers are better than entrees. Not a big fan of deep dish pizza as well. They only have a couple of good veggie options (ceaser salad doesn't count), like the avocado egg rolls and California veggie burger. However, no whole wheat options. Their breads are great but all fully refined flour. Their salads don't hold up in take away. The mini pizooki is nice dessert for two. Try the Ghirardeli chocolate one.

I placed the order on my app and went to pick up the order at the designated time. However, my order wasn't ready. I don't mind waiting a bit, so I waited patiently. I told the cashier in the takeout area that I had a coupon that I received via email. She told me that she'd need to get the manager. Fine. So, I waited. The manager came, didn't greet me, started typing stuff on the cash register like she was in a hurry and then said, ""here!"" and walked off. I said ""Excuse me"" twice as she was walking away, but she didn't hear me or her mind was somewhere else. So, I see her go in the back and I can see through the window she is eating food in the kitchen, where my meal is being prepared. I waited longer. The cashier finally came back with food (they were ""waiting on fries"") and I told her that I needed to speak to the manager because she didn't give me the right discount. The manager comes back and fixes it, and tells me to have a nice day. I was a bit irritated at this point, but my family was hungry so I take the food home. I get home and unpack the food and my ahi salad is completely wilted and the ahi was almost nonexistent. There were maybe 5 squares that were less than 1/2"" square, cut very thin. This is less than half the tuna I get at other locations. I couldn't even eat it the salad because it was warm and wilted. When I added the dressing, it all went to mush. The calamari was cold. Have you ever tried to eat cold, rubbery calamari?! YUCK. And my husband said that his fries weren't hot. So gross - all of it. The pizza was pizza. My kids ate it.

She offered some compensation for my troubles but most importantly was very genuine and polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock,2.32,2.51,2.74,,2.434

0,Brett J.,"Pflugerville, TX",184,198,591.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"Revisited and updating my review... This is still not a high end restaurant, but it is not supposed to be... BJs is a hamburger, pizza, ribs, type of place. A large leap up from an Applebee's or a chili's for sure but that kind of selection to the menu. I feel it is a bit pricey... $12 to $14 burgers gets to be a bit much to make this a more then a once in a while place for a family of 4.  My sons had the spaghetti and the chicken fingers and they both ate it all. My wife had the 1/2 rack of ribs at $18 and she ate every last bit. (She did say the ribs were not tender enough but that the taste was good!) I had a $13 burger called the chicken fried steak burger with an over easy egg on top... I have to say it was sooooooo freaking good I ate it all! (I'm miserably full now... ouch!) The waiter was great! Really nice guy, very attentive, and just one of those servers you hope to get every time. He truly was a great server. BJs makes their own beer too, although I didn't have any this time... stuck to water... my wife did have a mixed drink. But it was lack luster. I like this venue... I really always have. TVs everywhere playing sports, it is a big place with lots of seating, there is s huge menu... bathrooms are clean and generally it is descent food.  For a relaxed evening meal after hitting the outlet mall... well it's just what the doctor ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock,2.44,2.57,2.756,,2.518
3,Yamil C.,"Manor, TX",30,80,134.0,3.0,2018-01-10,"I've been to several Bj's and I love their menu eventhough at times it can be overwhelming. I sometimes wish for the cooks sake they will tighten that menu up, but i guess it works. This specific Bj's i probably wont go to again. I had a hair in my food and i decided not to complain i just pushed it to the side of my plate. However i was almost done with my food and i found another one. It really ruined my meal and by then i was ready to leave. Other than that the service was good abd tje ambiance was great. Hopefully you wont have the same experience because i really do like this establishment. Still give it a try but be cautious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock,2.44,2.59,2.764,,2.5300000000000002
5,Amy J.,"Logan, UT",19,1,,1.0,2018-01-11,"Worst customer service ever. A small issue with a salad turned into a huge issue when the waitress AND the manager were terribly rude and unhelpful. Then when one of our party left, the waitress came back to our table and said ""Did she even leave money?? Cuz she was complaining on her way out."" Then she took the money and kept the change- I suppose assuming it was a tip. But you don't assume a tip. The manager is obviously the real problem, because when she was approached about it she was just as rude and unhelpful. We will not be going back. Even though the pazookies are heavenly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-round-rock,2.44,2.58,2.748,,2.524
