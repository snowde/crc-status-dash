298,Kat C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,4.0,1.0,2012-01-03,Would give no stars if possible.  Not busy on Sunday at 5.  2 salads took 1 hr and 45 to get.  We then received one salad without dressing.  Never got refill offers on drinks.  Had ordered food to but they nvr embed to place order.   Todd manager offered a 50% off one entree and that took another 30 mintuted.  Manager and all employees never smile or greet customers This natomas location is not the typical BJ quality at all.  Terrible service today,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=360,3.16,3.26,3.26,2.5320000000000005,3.2200000000000006
443,Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57.0,2.0,2012-01-12,"Wow! We had an absolutely terrible experience here, customer service wise.  We called ahead for a group of 7 and the table was ready just when they said it would be. That is the end of the positives. They appeared to be very busy and the waitress was definitely not lazy BUT the customer service was seriously unsatisfactory. So much so that the manager had to go around to various tables to apologize and explain that they had ""no shows"" in the kitchen.   After taking everyone's order, the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell us that they were out of one of the items. The disturbing thing was that she didn't come back for 10 minutes to take the order again. Salads appetizers were delivered in two rounds. Half the table got theirs first. The other half got theirs 10 minutes later. If you're still with me and doing the math then you can see that we have been sitting her over 40 minutes by now. The one thing that really disturbed me (and I thought was pretty unforgivable) was that they did not give the 4 year old ANYTHING! They were slow (and they knew it) and nothing was served to the little one...even though he had ordered applesauce as his side dish. His mom had to ASK for it. The little angel never said a peep. His grouchy aunties and uncles were acting up more than he was.  Pizza was good as was the other dishes ordered by my companions (forgive me for not memorizing them). The much touted Pizookie was tasty. I liked the red velvet the best with cookies and cream a close second. I have to say though that it was slightly overrated. I didn't like how it stuck to the bottom of the metal pan. Isn't there a better way to make it? Food was decent but I would likely not return simply because of the service. If you are that short staffed in the kitchen, or elsewhere, you should close a section or get in the kitchen and cook yourself.

448,Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",561,790,1237.0,2.0,2012-02-15,"Nobody puts baby in the corner... This rating is solely for my last visit. As expected, it was slightly busier due to two facts; 1) It was a Saturday night, 2) It was almost post Kings game time. We didn't mind waiting at the bar, Tim & Sean poured generously while we waited for our buzzer to go off. As we are being guided through the restaurant, we literally are seated in the very back corner of the restaurant, right by the little server cubby. Bad luck of the draw, sucks to be us, right?!? Then to top it off, our server had a stanky personality. He was grumpy, barely audible, grunted instead of speaking, and was curmudgeon like. I can deal with these last two things...but the deal breaker was that they were completely out of Peanut Butter Pizookie. These are literally my grown woman's crack, I live to eat these things any time I walk in to a BJ's. Our server came up and said ""...we are out of peanut butter,"" no remorse, no consoling, no customer service. He didn't ask if we still wanted anything, he just walked away. About 5 minutes later he dropped the check on our table, again, without a word being said. Our actual meals were not with their normal goodness either. I hope it was just an off night, because generally I absolutely love BJ's. The Mac-n-Cheese was extremely dry. Our Black & Bleu burger was came with the aioli when asked for on the side. Nothing was going in our favor, on top of a bad King's loss. Needless to say, our curmudgeon of a server left a less than pleasant taste in our mouth for this location.

The food was cold and look like it had been sitting a while.  Five minutes later the remaining half of our dishes arrived. My sandwich was missing some ingredients. The food runner took the whole plate, instead of leaving me at least the fries to eat while I waited, and I never did eat in the restaurant.

385,Michael W.,"Sacramento, CA",96,99,3.0,3.0,2012-03-28,"BJ's seems to get packed at about 10pm since all the respectable restaurants are closed by that time and all the respectable people are home watching a Blu Ray from the Redbox.  With that said, it's a great place to be able to get something to eat late at night when all these other places are closed to us awake, fun-loving people. I got the sample of 8 - 4oz beers ($13) and the Jalapeno burger, medium. She got the quesadilla, a hard thing for a true Mexican girl to get at an American Fare place like BJ's.  For my palate, most of the beers were just okay, except for the Piranha Pale Ale - that was the best, but the fact that they have the sampler is what makes the beer experience. My burger was cooked to order, which is something that a lot of restaurants can't do for some reason. I wasn't thrilled about the jalapenos being deep fried since that takes away the heat and the flavor.  The burger was good - just good, nothing great and it came with an order of skinny fries. This place is classy for being up late with the rest of us, but you have to pay for that class.  I'd rather pay the $2 buck at a dive bar for a beer and poor lighting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=380,3.32,3.22,3.22,2.7640000000000002,3.2600000000000007

My pulled pork sandwich was fine and my fries were hot, the coleslaw however, had little to no dressing. My Mom had the Roast Beef Dip and the first one was ice cold as were her fries - the bartender (we sat at the bar) was kind enough to replace it - which took forever - he even spoke to TWO managers to try and speed things up. When it came out - very little meat, non-melted cheese - overall BAD - Mom was NOT happy. Then one manager came over and she complained about the amount of meat and he says ""oh, it's pre-packed in baggies, let me check..."" never saw him again. Dad's mac n' cheese was discusting, we all tasted it - gross, and also not hot. Then, the bartender gave us a sample of an upcoming Spring Salad of mixed greens, watermelon and feta - the salad and melon were totally wilted and there was absolutely no flavor to the ""light balsamic vinagrette"". They may want to re-think that one. Bottom line, I feel like the manager should have at least offered to take mom's sandwich off the bill, but didn't and we paid and left - swearing to never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600,3.28,3.19,3.19,2.404,3.226

I super appreciate the seating the waiter let us have also...the half circle couch tables (lol sorry I don't know what they're called) instead of the dinky table for 2. Those seats are usually for 3+ but he still seated us there on a crowded Saturday night! Yay for our waiter! We first ordered drinks - bf got a beer that I didn't try and I was stuck between two fruity drinks and asked the waiter to recommend me one.

I guess I shouldn't complain....I should have expected it, right? They did have a health-conscious section that consisted of a total of FOUR items :/ Wish they had a bit more. Well, I decided...fuck it. I'll treat myself for the day and got the crispy chicken sandwich. It was goood :) By the way - if any of you are wondering, the crispy jalapeno burger is HUGE. When I saw it on the menu I thought it looked big but when I saw a waitress holding it....wow. Amazing. Lastly, atmosphere is great. Great place to hang out with friends (but you probably already knew that) and chill. They have TVs everywhere for you to watch your sports games and a bar area.

Several minutes later, she brings us all glasses of ice water, which we didn't ask for, and no hot water. So we politely reminded her that we would like some hot water, as she was taking our food orders. So, out comes the rest of the drinks and our chips and salsa - and no hot water. We all kind of looked at each other like ""wtf?"". We all watched as she hurried around to her other tables, clearing off their dishes. Finally I had enough and flagged her down, again requesting some hot water. As we were waiting on that, three different people came out and brought our food. They asked if we needed anything else, and we requested three ranches. She finally showed up with the hot water, and by that time, my glass of lemonade had been dry for far too long, as well as our beer and ciders.

The third time, over this past weekend it was not fully cooked. The dough was still white and raw inside, the cheese had not melted, and the pepperoni was layed out in stacks. It was 3 or four slices on pepperoni on top of each other in one spot with the rest of the slice empty. Some slices even had no pepperoni. This pizza cost over $20 by the way. Little Caesar's would have done a better job for $5. Just a huge disappointment. I'm giving them one last shot.

Last night I stopped in for dinner and the Niner game with 9 other friends. Service was attentive, our waitress checked on us so many times when we weren't ready we decided to let her know we'd flag her down when we decided. The restaurant wasn't super packed but got busier as the night progressed and the Niners vs Bears game was on. My boyfriend and I shared the new Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza and nachos. The pizza was really good the nachos were okay. I enjoyed the flavors and amount of toppings on the pizza. It seemed liked there could have been more toppings on the nachos for the amount of chips. Also the waitress actually forgot to put our nacho order in but they came out pretty soon after we reminded her. Actually for a party of 10 all the food came out pretty quick.

This time, the service was fast and the waitress was nice (unlike the people I encountered last time) and most of all the food was a lot better.

We had a disappointing dinner here recently, and I took the General Manager's Card so I could email him. Alas, a full week later, not a word. So, Mr. Sandoval, here you go! We arrived a little before 5 pm, and handed the hostess our Rewards Card. The restaurant was less than half full, with one large party seated in the middle dining section. We were taken to the first two-top in that section, arguably the worst table in the house at anytime since every patron and server must squeeze by it, but made worse by being next to an 18 person party. I asked if we could have a different table, and was immediately seated in one of the raised curved booths, (from which I watched two other couples in the course of our meal refuse that table.) I was, truthfully, a little put out by this - there's no good reason to seat people at a poor table when the restaurant is not busy. It took slightly longer than usual for the waiter to take our drink order since he was also serving the large party, but he was very nice. Once our drinks arrived, we each ordered an appetizer and a main course, and the waiter said he would have the apps out right away.  After about 20 minutes, we saw waiter bringing our appetizers. That's slightly longer than we usually wait for our food at Bj's, but we figured it was the large party and were being patient. A runner right behind our waiter was carrying two more plates, which turned out to be our sandwiches. Waiter said ""oh, the apps took longer than expected and everything came out at once, can I get you anything else?""  We were dumbfounded but hungry, so we accepted our food. I'm sure I was not very gracious, however. I alternated bites of app and dinner so I got at least part of my food hot, but it was awkward and felt rushed.  While I recognize that BJ's is casual dining, I don't think that anyone expects to have all their courses served at once. I don't know if the order was put in incorrectly or if the kitchen made a mistake, and, as the customer, I don't really care - either the kitchen or our server should have caught the mistake and ensured that it was corrected.  Since this was a birthday dinner for us, we would probably have ordered a second drink after the app and had dessert.

318,Jeff K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,12,1.0,1.0,2013-10-20,"I have been a customer of BJ's restaurant for a long time, just like anyone else. The level of service I had received in the past was definitely up to par - until coming to this particular BJ's.  It was my friends 26th birthday. We stopped by late (around 11) for her free pazooki and a drink, to unwind from sushi. Unfortunately her license expired on her actual birthday, but for legal purposes, she brought her paper license  from the DMV.  When our group had finished ordering our drinks, we were routinely asked for our IDs by our nice waitress. When noticing the birthday girl was carrying an expired ID, my friend quickly pulled out the DMV paper license. Our waitress had kindly asked that she double check with her manager to see if it was allowed.  We then were rudely informed by the GM that they could not serve the birthday pazooki, as well as her alcoholic beverage. Our group had quickly replied to his remark, explaining that the DMV had assured her that the paper was still a valid ID - for drinks, as well as driving - but he increasingly began to lose his patience with us. He was not accommodating to such a special occasion, and additionally continued to condescendingly state that he had every right to refuse service, when our group was more than understanding and kind about the matter, even though we were all well over 21 years old.  I am not rating  poorly because of some bias against the franchise, but because of the horrible management, and the quality of how we were treated by this manager. I still wonder if it was just a horrible day for the GM in particular, or if he viewed us negatively because we are college students.  I believe that he is still accountable for his poor decision to flaunt such a negative attitude towards paying customers. I have already contacted headquarters to further fix this issue, so that nobody has to deal with such poor managerial service.     I would definitely not recommend this particular BJ's to anyone I know in the Sacramento/Davis area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=280,3.04,3.05,3.168,2.18,3.046

444,Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17.0,4.0,2013-10-25,"It was my younger son's 2nd birthday and we were at the Sleeptrain for Disney On Ice. My youngest is probably the pickiest eater of the family, so for his birthday we wanted to get something we knew he would eat, so we decided to get his favorite foods of pizza, cookies and ice cream. We came for a slightly late lunch and they said they had to take a couple of minutes to get our table together. Once we were seated we ordered quickly. My mom and husband got small salads to start and the boys got applesauce. I decided I really didn't want pizza so I got their ahi tuna salad as an entree.  My salad was large, very fresh and full of good things, although I asked for them to remove the red peppers and they did not. They were big enough that I was able to easily pick them out. The tuna on it wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was decent and I liked the pickled cucumber in the salad. My family all loved the pizza and ate the majority of it with some leftovers to take home. Then the best part, on your birthday they will give you a Pizookie with ice cream and a candle in it.  I remember back in the day they used to give you a full-size Pizookie for your birthday, but now they give you a mini one. That was okay, since my son ate most of it on his own and the rest of us ordered another large one to split.  He was in cookie and ice cream heaven. The Pizookie is basically a deep dish cookie that they bring out hot with ice cream on it. They have several different types like a basic chocolate chip, a triple chocolate, a red velvet, oreo, etc. The full size ones are good for sharing and will feed three or four people. They also have a sampler, which is three of the mini ones, which is nice if you want to try several flavors. Although you still probably want to split it, unless you have a major sweet tooth.  Lunchtime seems to be busy, but not too crowded, whereas dinner at any BJ's particularly on the weekend can have significant wait times.

193,Phil C.,"Orangevale, CA",74,22,16.0,1.0,2014-06-18,"I have always been a fan of BJ's. Having said that, when  I think of take out on the fly I think of this restaurant.  So this time after losing 5 unsuccessful tries to place an order on the phone and 10 minutes on hold to get disconnected it was time to go in and place an order at the to go counter. I'm that determined to get dinner.  When I arrive I grab a menu to confirm the name of the items I was going to order. I was told that it would be a minute after an order was given out. I agreed knowing it would buy me some time to glance at other items like dessert.  The 2nd order was given out to other take our customers. One minute after the 3rd order was called for other customers. I understand, I work in customer service too. I know the importance of getting customers out. I also know the importance of getting orders into the kitchen be able to reduce wait time. We have all been there, hurry up and get the order in to wait less.  When the 4th order is called and I haven't been asked what I want to order I pay more attention. It's been 6 minutes and still no time for me. I'm still looking at the TVs at the bar holding a menu. There is a young man that walked in that's greeted immediately, asked if he's picking up, after he confirms his name the girl leaves to go check out back.  5 minutes later she returns with his food and still no time for me to place my order. I'm now wondering if I missed something.  I guess waiting 11 minutes to place a take out order is normal now! I yelp the hours for chipotle. After all we pay more and leave a tip at bjs and not chipotle.  I didn't want to stick around now and place an order, wait for my food and get home to eat. I would've been eating at 11pm.  Chipotle closes at 10pm and when I walked in at 957pm the greeted me with a smile. Sadly I've been leaving nothing for a tip at chipotle.      Time to re-evaluate my loyalty towards bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=220,3.12,3.0,3.092,2.148,3.0480000000000005

We ordered the ahi tuna appetizer with our drinks, and not only did our drinks take quite a while, when we finally received our appetizer it tasted nothing like any other ahi dish we have had at any other bjs. We had to tell another waiter about our dissatisfaction because for most of the night our waiter was no where to be found. And then when we complained he started avoiding us. After about 15 minutes with no new appetizer we asked our waiter when he finally came around, (which once again he was not checking on us or even refilling our drinks for the matter) to speak with the manager.  When the manager came over we explained all our issues and he was very apologetic, and said he was going to personally check on our orders and even asked my friend if he wanted another beer. And that was the last we saw of the manager. When we FINALLY received out appetizer and dishes, (which the appetizer was better,not even great and my own dish lukewarm) the manager not once came back and asked how we were and how any of our food. That to me speaks very loudly poor manager skills, poor customer skills, and just poor manners in general. And then when we get the bill the beer the manager offered my friend was added into the bill on top of the appetizer that wasn't that great. It isn't about the money, or even taking anything off.  If the manager at least came over, or if the server offered better service would have changed the tone of our meal, but after being a server for 4 years I can easily say I will not ever be coming back to this bjs and it really has made me reevaluate going back to any bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=300,2.6,2.84,3.02,2.6920000000000006,2.744

Excellent customer service. So good we ended up joining their rewards program!! Now to the food!! If you are on a diet this is a good place to eat. They have stuffed mushrooms that are to die for. Also the ahi poke is yummy and healthy. By far the apps are what you should order. Sometimes that's all I get! The corn aioli is delish and they have a new pepperoni pizza dip I'm in love with. Must try. I can say they could improve on service issues in the main dining tables. Takes way too long to get a new beer or a side of mayo. But that's the reason we usually sit by the bar.

After bring sat in the same place as the day before(Yes I came two days in a row) we saw our same waiter and were pretty happy. He was on top of it Halloween night and super nice!! This is where the service changed for the worst. I believe a lady by the name of Renee walked up to our table. A little ditzy ""hope you are all having a good Sunday"" we looked at her and informed her it was Saturday. We asked for silverware. We had already been waiting a while so we gave her our drink, appetizer and food order all at once. We should of asked for a different waiter at this point as she stumbled through the order. Drinks and appetizers were refilled and brought to table by many different staff after this. Stuffed mushrooms and pot stickers were only warm when brought to the table. Sent back potstickers to get the same luke warm ones back again. When food came the pastas were great, hamburger was great, but as always  one of our guests requests for a dry pastrami wasn't dry (this is not the first or second time this has happened at this exact BJS but multiple) as usual the same manager comes out in his blue shirt I think his name was Jeremy (surprised he didn't recognize us) said he's sorry for the inconvenience and comped the pot stickers and pastrami and a new one would be out quickly. The second one arrived and from the seat I was sitting in could smell burnt bread I myself reach over and flipped the bun and the inside of the bun was toasted beyond burnt. The person eating this was super disappointed sitting 20+ minutes watching everyone else eat just decided to eat the burnt sandwich. I was obviously mad at this point being that I asked to come here two days in a row. So I stopped Renee our waiter to ask why the bun was burnt (I even had her smell the burnt bun) she informed our table that this is how it's made and if she was eating this sandwich this is just how she would like it prepared.

I came in here last night took 15 minutes to be greeted by a server and they got all of our food wrong. We came today again since it was one of our friend's birthday/graduation lunch. It took 5 minutes to be seated since we were a walk in of 9 people. I didnt mind since I know how it is to work at a restaurant. Then it took 10 minutes to be greeted by a server after that it took almost half an hour for our food to come out the server didnt check up on us or anything then later on she came by when we all got our food already and asked if we needed anything else then she started talking about her life story. Im sorry but i dont care how busy you are and what you wanna do after work. You were horrible. You didnt even bother to come by and say that our food is coming soon at least or apologize. Second thing half of our food was cold we didnt want to send it back because we didnt want to wait another 20 minutes for the same food we ordered the first time.

My bf and I got there and the host did not greet us at all. We stood there like idiots, then finally a nice lady came up to us and got our name and we had to wait. Two other couple came after us but got seated right before us. Got seated and then waited for a good 7 mins for our waitress to serve us water. We waited another 25-30 mins for our food to come, which we understand because it was somewhat busy. Our food came and it was a disaster! My bfs burger came with no lettuce, tomatoes, pickles or onions! He ordered medium rare but got a dry piece of meat in his burger..my Alfredo noodles was dry and some strings of the noodles was hard. My dish was warm, almost cold. My bf told the waitress that his burger came with no greens. She told us that the guy must've switched his burger with someone else and she went to go grab some greens which took her 8 mins...(after around this time, it wasn't busy at all) she came back and placed the plate of greens on it but didn't even apologized for what happened. Got our check and placed my card in the folder and she came to grab it right away. As when we were walking past the hosts, none of them said ""thank you"" or ""have a nice night"", the two ladies just stood there and talked to each other.

199,Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1314,1006,6490.0,4.0,2015-05-01,i had a great experience coming to this location. i had came here with my family after the barry manilow concert. we were sat down quick. then we were asked what we like to drink. we had plenty of time looking at the menu and deciding what we want. we were pretty quick about it since we hungry after the concert from resisting on the popcorn and nachos and you know the arm and leg kind of junk food snacks. anyways it was late at night maybe around 11pm and it was still packed. it happened to be on a week night and i thought maybe they had happy hour after 9 but maybe it was over and they said no not for tonight i said ok.  anyways we ordered a small sized pizza i believe it was the great white shark pizza. next we ordered their new dish of fajita nachos with beef i believe. the cajun chicken pasta with fettecune noodles. also one kids meal with chicken nuggets and fries.  the food wait wasn't long til we got the food. the nachos came out first and we were disappointed how the cheese stuck together and wasn't the regular cheesy dip. i knew the price we paid of course they used the real cheese to melt it but it was stuck in a whole bunch. next the pizza came out and we each had a pieces and they were big slices and were deep dish which was awesome with some ranch dip. next we had the pasta and omg this was the most amazing dish in our table. the pasta noodles were on point for the texture and mainly the taste to the sauce was good and chicken was well seasoned and char grilled too. it also came with 2 garlic bread sticks and they were so crunchy and tasty too. the kids meal was just plain chicken nuggets with fries and nothing to special with that since it was for a kid.  the service was great and attentive and came and check up on us. the server has to come back multiple times refilling the water since we were all dehydrated form all the dancing beforehand. i did have some craving for their alcohol drinks such as the strawberry splash but i was with family and i was the driver so of course i had to refrain myself from getting something with alcohol. i think the only thing missing with my meal was a ice cold beer or the strawberry splash haha. anyways hope this review help in sort of a way and had you imagined being their with me dining hehe. have a great day and thanks for reading.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=220,3.04,3.05,3.02,2.9920000000000004,3.046

597,Anne T.,"Sacramento, CA",121,69,17.0,1.0,2015-05-19,"I've been to this BJs probably between 5-10 times, mostly getting take out for myself and co-workers at work. This BJs location is atrocious for takeout-- they consistently get my orders wrong and make no effort to correct it when I call. At least 3 times, I've picked up my takeout only to arrive back at the office to discover that one or more items have been left out. When I've called BJs to inform them of the missing items, they tell me that I can either A) drive all the way back over for a refund or B) that they will mail me a gift card in the mail. A gift card? Since I either paid with a credit card or cash I expect to be refunded with either a credit to my account or send me a check. What good does a gift card do me?  Not wanting to drive all the way back out there, however, twice I picked option B and told them to mail me a gift card. Guess what? Both times they failed to send me out my refund on a gift card. I called to follow up with managers twice and was told a gift card for my refund would be promptly in the mail. They never came. This is basically tantamount to theft since I never got what I paid for and they never refunded me my money. The last time it happened I did drive back to receive a cash refund (though that does not compensate me for my time and mileage driving over there).  Yes, I probably should have checked out each order but the thing is that when you are picking up take out for a large group of people and are on a tight lunch schedule it is often impractical to check everything thoroughly to make sure that everything is there. This is their job and I expect it to be done correctly. It never is. I'm either missing items and/or the items are not as ordered. The worst part for me though is the lack of making it right by the managers when they get it wrong--specifically in failing to refund my money when I didn't get the item I paid for. I estimate I've lost about $30 in orders I did not receive a refund for from this location. I lost patience in trying to get in contact with them about it but will use the power of the yelp review from hopefully saving others from the experience I have had here.

143,Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,244,1452.0,4.0,2015-06-11,"Out of all the BJ's locations I've been to, this one is my favorite! I've dined at this location over 50 times so I've had a wide range of experiences, but majority of them have been above average to excellent. One thing that stands out about this location is the customer service. I've come across some of the best waiters/waitresses in the dining industry here in this unsuspecting little BJ's. In the recent months, there were a couple of male waiters in the bar area and at least one female waitress in the restaurant area that were amazing! Genuinely friendly, excited, positive, and helpful! Definitely top notch customer service. There were a few times that I had waitresses that were not quite as excellent/genuine and some rather cold, but I can't let that take away from those that did provide excellent service.  A few other instances when I thought service was great - one time I came when their credit card machine was broken. The place was packed and the workers looked frantic as I overheard several of them saying they never used the manual credit card reader. I decided to order takeout instead of dining in. During all this chaos, the lady taking my order was still very positive, patient, and kept a friendly smile. She offered me a free beverage during my wait and was kind and helpful the entire time. The food came out a lot faster than I expected as well. Another time, the manager Jeremy had quickly addressed my issue when I felt something didn't taste right. He offered to take the dish off the bill or replace it (although I just kept it as it wasn't that bad). Also, being a loyalty member, I usually receive emails for a survey regarding my experience. Whether positive or negative, the general manager Shawn always responds and addresses concerns if there are any. One other note - the hostesses are USUALLY pretty good about greeting people when they come in or thanking them when they leave (although this was not done last night when I came and left). But out of 50+ times, the percentage of above average customer service is in the greater.  So onto the food. Not everything on this menu is 5 star and sometimes my favorite dishes come out better than other times. One of my must orders is the avocado egg rolls. Last night, it was one of the best ever! Crispy on the outside with perfect and generous amounts of avocado dipped in that sweet tamarind sauce...super delicious! I also tried the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and they were fantastic. They do have a tiny spicy kick. One of my favorite pizzas is their BJ's Favorite. Sometimes it's really good, but yesterday's was just ok. There was a lot of dough and the toppings were not spread out very well so some slices were practically naked. And the bell pepper toppings were not cooked very well. So not the best this time. I've ordered this dish several times in the past and it came out very tasty. Another great appetizer is their chicken wings with buffalo and ranch sauce. The chicken wings are usually moist and juicy and not over dry.  They do offer a kids menu. For $5.75, the chicken tenders, side of fries, and a cup of milk is not too bad. All kids meals include an entree, side, and drink for $5.75.  Of course, I can't forget the pizookie! Nothing beats the Cookies N' Cream pizookie, but all the flavors are really good! Some may say the pizookie is too sweet (and it probably is for one person), but it definitely should be shared! They have mini sizes now and even those can be shared. If  you are celebrating a birthday, they offer a free mini pizookie. Nice! BJ's is definitely one of the best chain restaurants amongst its kind. At this location especially, the food is usually pretty good, but the service is great.

As we perused through our menus I saw the waiter attend the two tables next to us. He did this a few times. Not once did he acknowledge us. Only after four more guests arrived and were attended within a minute of being seated did I get upset.  I went up to the hostess and asked her if we were going to be attended. She grabbed the manager. He urged us to stay. My table decided to try our luck elsewhere.  Honestly, it felts as if we weren't welcomed. You see... the majority of the other guest were caucasian and so were the servers. The party of four who were attended to right away were also caucasian. It seems like BJ's provides slow service selectively and since this is a reportedly frequent occurrence it has to be coming from management. Natomas is one of the most divers neighborhoods in all of the US. Is this why BJ's in Natomas has so many poor service reviews? It might be something worth looking into. Perhaps BJ's should also look into their hiring policies. All the wait staff was Caucasian, hardly representative of the neighboring population.

94,Amy J.,"Sacramento, CA",523,204,1015.0,4.0,2016-02-24,"It always feels a little wonky doing a review for a popular chain. Everybody's kinda been there, done that. However, when a particular location does a few things very well, it seems worthy of pointing out.  Even though the BF and I are non-drinkers, we usually plant our butts on the barstools. We both love watching sports and one of the biggest advantages of dining at any BJ's are the multiple TVs. Another plus here is that you'll probably be waited on by Haans or Channing, easily two of the friendliest and most efficient bartenders I've ever met. They always greet new friends with a smile and never let a glass go empty for long. The quality of the food here has dramatically improved over the last year. A French dip that used to have tough, stringy meat is now tender and loaded with meat. They stepped up the au jus too, adding herbs and seasonings. Calamari is more consistent as well, arriving perfectly crisp on the outside, with soft squid inside. My inner sauce queen loves that they serve it with marinara and aioli for dipping. Two fairly recent additions to the menu that are worthy of an enthusiastic thumbs-up are the salmon quinoa bowl and the portobello Swiss burger. The salmon is an incredible value. For $12 at lunch you get a bed of seasoned quinoa topped with mushrooms, roasted red bell, sautéed red onion, asparagus, and a generous portion of glazed salmon. I'd been skeptical of ordering it, fearing it would be bland. Not so, it was very tasty and less than 795 calories as a bonus. The portobello burger was unexpectedly gourmet. The large slice of umami bombed mushroom on top of the burger was of course a treat, but I didn't realize they were also throwing in arugula, caramelized onions, pesto, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend adding bacon to really take it over the moon. However, the $2 extra for bacon takes it out of value range creating a whopping $15 burger. Worth it occasionally, but probably won't be on the regular rotation.  The rewards program is one of the best in corporate America. You earn a point for every dollar spent. Several different rewards are available, but the one I like to shoot for is earning $25 off your meal after 350 points. Not so hard to do if you darken their doorway about twice a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=60,3.04,3.07,3.024,2.576,3.058

I brought family here that visited from GA and my wife, hairstylist, recommended this chain to all her clients. We were very disappointed when I ordered the ""6 oz"" steak. When it arrived it was smaller than the palm of my hand and only about a 1/2 inch thick. My wife first commented on it because Weight Watchers says a steak the size of your palm is a 3 oz steak.  We pointed this out to our waitress who tried to justify it by saying, ""that is before cooked"".  Really?  There is 50% shrinkage!? The manager finally came over and was going to justify the size by saying how thick it was. I showed that it was actually very thin. When we received our bill she had comped the steak. Which is the only reason I went back to BJ's. This time to a different location.  I went with a group from work and ordered the lunch portion salmon. While the oz's were not listed, when my plate arrived the whole table laughed at my sliver of salmon. It was hardly larger than a club cracker!! It was wedge shaped, less than 1/2 inch on the ""fat"" end and within an inch tapered to only about a 1/16 of and inch.  This sliver of salmon couldn't have been more than 1 1/2 oz's.  I didn't complain, I didn't send it back. I won't beg a restaurant to serve me a respectable sized serving for the money I paid them. I just won't go back. I won't take my family and these stories have been told to every one of my wife's clients.

If there are issues with food, the management is quite ready to make it right in some way. Good food: Brussel sprouts appetizer, most of the ""enlightened"" (healthy) menu, pizza. Drinks: The beer is better than average, though it may disappoint beer snobs (like me) a bit.  It is brewed by the company, but not on premises.  Hop Storm and Jeremiah Red are not bad.  My wife has enjoyed the lemon drop and pina colada at various times.

I enjoyed most everything I've ordered... been to this one and a few others probably a half dozen times total. The beers are pretty good, the cocktails are a little hit and miss, and the menu is a mixed bag. What I mean by that is they really try to tackle a large variety of dishes and continually add new things to the menu to see how customers like them. I've tried some of the experimental dishes and that's what they tasted like... experiments. Typically I'd like the first few bites and then I'd realize that it was overall waaaaay to salty or sugary. For price and portions though I still thought everything is pretty fair here and I'll likely come back here and there. I saw some complaints on service here, but I've always had great service here. They would accommodate to any seating requests I had, which is important if you bring kids, and our waiters/waitresses have always responded to us quick and kept our drinks filled.

So fiancé ended up ordering the deep dish ziti which we weren't completely impressed by. The flavor was not great nor did they add enough basil .

Our waitress was one of the worst waitresses I have ever had, I wish I knew her name to post it here but honestly I didn't see her enough the whole trip to get her name. I actually had to get up after our food was delivered and walk across the restaurant to get someone to bring me water. Originally the waitress took 20 min to bring two waters and a beer to our table then never came back to being more water or offer new drinks.  She finally came back to our table to take our order but was very short and had no sense of urgency or care at all. We had a party of 7 you would think she, at the very minimum would care about her tip, but she didn't. We ended up tipping two dollars only because we couldn't walk away giving her nothing. Our food was cold like it had been sitting in the window way too long he pizza was soggy and they never brought my nieces burger at all we ended up canceling her burger because she was hungry we gave her some of our food (she is only 7 didn't quite understand why she didn't get food).  It took 2 hours to get a cold pizza and finally get out of the damn restaurant.

I have to admire the way that our server, Robert, delivered that bit of bad news. The manager also came by and apologized and offered them (my bro and his wife) some salads as the pizza was still being made. They accepted his offer and my mom ended up sharing her pizza with them.

And the waiters are always willing to replace my broccoli with chicken since I dont like brocolli, for no extra charge. Even the first time I asked my regular waiters to take out the brocolli they offered me more chicken with no hesitation. I didn't even asked for it. So I always ask for no brocolli and they give me the extra chicken with no fee. Until having the worst experience ever on August when this waiter decided to have a lot of attitude with me even before ordering my food. When I ordered my usual dish he right away cut my words saying in such a very rude way there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli for chicken. I didn't like the way he approached to me so I decided to talk to the manager and that manager told me ""This guy is a good worker"" and this manager told me that yes there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli but hes going to do it that time for free. The manager just excused that waiter and I didn't even got an apologize for that attitude, instead the manager sent me the same waiter to attend me. I ate, pay and left the restaurant with a bad experience but I didn't want to post this on yelp, so I didn't.  After that I came back and my waiters treated me, as always, with respect and I replaced my brocolli for chicken with no question.  Until tonight, I had the unfortunate of having the same crummy waiter with a lot of attitude and he even recognized me. I ordered my regular dish chicken alfredo and asked him to replace brocolli for chicken. He answered right away and with a sarcastic smile ""dont you remember what my manager told you that we charge extra for the chicken"" arent waiters supposed to be courteous to the customers? Because he sure wasn't. His attitude was worst than the first time so I had to get up and left the restaurant. Im not planning to ever come back again even though this was my favorite restaurant.  I understand that there could be extra charges but there is always courtesy from waiters and that is the hook that makes a customer come back to the restaurant and that is the reason why I was a regular customer and used to come during my lunch break. In fact, i think courtesy to customers is more important that profiting $1 to replace brocolli. To me it shows that the business is weak and cares nothing about its customers.

The menu was changed and they took off my favorite meal, the balsamic chicken. So I had to find something new which wasn't a problem. The waiter started out at the table by complaining about a party of 16 and his night. We were out for an anniversary dinner so the complaining was not the best way to start out the night. I ordered a steak and asked to get the mashed potatoes without cheese. The waiter said that was not possible which now leads me to know the food is just pre-made frozen and warmed up. When I told him I would find something different on the menu the waiter went back and forth with me 3-4 times pushing me to get the steak which ended in a slight argument. I kept telling him I would find something different. He was confused as to why I did not want the steak with the potato. In my opinion when I stated I would pick something else the issue should have been dropped. From that point on it was a waiting game for the food. My burger wasn't great, they no longer have shoe string fries, and our pizza was cold. When we got our appetizer, 15 minutes after getting one salad for the table, there was not any lemon for the calamari.

I ordered pita nachos and they brought out a flat bread pizza with a few macho ingredients!  The tortilla soup was over salted had no chips in it or avocado as shown in the picture!

47,Kristina T.,"Sacramento, CA",74,209,673.0,4.0,2016-12-26,"Early on during the week, my girlfriends and I decided on doing a get together dinner at BJs on a Friday. Being occupied with Christmas two days away, it did not occur to me that I was having dinner during one of the busiest nights, Friday. Though there were plenty of parking available pulling into the lot you would not know there were so many people waiting to be seated inside. Luckily, some of my friends arrived before me and were able to add our names to the list. Thank goodness the wait wasn't dreadful because it was packed and no where to sit; standing room only. Lol. Btw, waiting outside wasn't an option because it was freezing! Not more than 15 minutes later our party was seated.  Our waiter's name was Sergio. He was great, very approachable and funny. He was also prompt on getting things we asked for too, I wish all servers can be efficient like him. Anyways, we started off by ordering some alcoholic beverages because sometimes the Holidays can be rough. My drink choice was the Piranha Pale Ale which was good being that I'm not a drinker. Along side our drinks we had avocado egg rolls, siracha brussel sprouts and the calamari for appetizers. The egg rolls were good but too spicy for my liking and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were really good. For the main entree I had the chicken alfredo. When I ordered my meal I did tell Sergio that I wanted extra sauce but when my dish arrived at the table, it was still dry. I had to ask for more sauce and by that time I was over my meal. So I packed it to go and my kids enjoyed it. Haha. Like any other BJs, I can't leave without eating a pazookie! Lol. For the 5 of us, we ordered the party platter pazookie which is around $22. It was definitely cheaper than getting individual pazookies @ $7-8ea. We were able to choose up to 4 flavors; Oreo, macadamia, salted caramel and good ole chocolate chip. I could do without the salted caramel and Oreo though, it's way too sweet. When given our check Sergio was able to split it up by meals for us which was nice and effortless to pay and tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=20,2.64,2.76,2.96,2.8640000000000003,2.712

We said yes and she said well why don't I just sit you here, there's no one sitting there. We thanked her and she asked for our name so she could take us off the list.

The fambam decided to stop here after our long drive from Reno. After sitting in a car for almost 4 hours, our starving bellies needed food- STAT! Thankfully we were seated right away and a plus is that they were playing the Warriors Game on a tv nearby (funny to see, we were the only table cheering when GSW scored, LOL).  Our server, Robert showed up to take our drink orders shortly thereafter. If you're looking for the a friendly, personable server - then Robert may NOT be the server for you. We weren't expecting a bubbly personality, but at least a smile. He comes off cold, almost with an attitude like he doesn't want to be at work. Weird.  Our food orders were placed then the wait game began. After watching almost 2 full quaternary of basketball, it started to dawn on us that the food was taking FORever. One of the ""managers"" finally came out to inform us that there was an issue that has since then been resolved and our food will be out shortly. A few minutes later my food along with my 'rents food came out, yet my hubby's food was still MIA. After what felt like 10 minutes from the initial manager, a second manager came out to inform us my hubby's food will be comped and will be out shortly. The wait was ridiculous.  In regards to the food, the temperature could have been warmer but at that point we just wanted to eat then get the heck outta there. The lemon thyme chicken was good; it came with brown rice and veggies. The lemon pepper chicken wings were good, with a nice crunch. My mom's penne shrimp dish was okay, could have used more sauce - but the garlic knot was good. My hubby's salmon was overcooked, but was served with tasty quinoa.

The portions of food were large and the appearance of the food was great. After that everything started going down hill and the last time I came here was an eye opener. The service has gotten much slower and the time we spend waiting has gone up as well. I mean really it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a refill on a soda. On top of that the portions have gotten smaller. I remember how big the portions used to be when it came to burgers and fries and now the portions make me feel like I'm eating off kids menu. Last time I ordered a burger I specified cheese to be put on my burger and it never made it on the patty. On top of that, it looked like the burger was put together with a blindfold. The fries...well the portions on them has gone down as well and you're still hungry after you finish your plate.The service is also poor. It's painfully slow and at times insulting. I asked for a refill on a soda and the waiter acknowledged my request but he came back to my table later empty handed. I told him again and after 10 minutes I had to flag him down to ask about my drink.

We were a party of five excited to have dinner and celebrate Pi day with $3 Pizookies. It was a slow evening, so we were seated immediately. After 15 minutes, we weren't greeted by a server, no drink order taken. I had to get up and ask someone for service. When i asked if we could have service, a waitress (didn't catch her name but she had dark hair and tattoos on her arms), seemed annoyed that I was even talking to her and told me we would be helped shortly. It took so long that our drink and food order was taken at the same time. Our WATER showed up 10 minutes later and the sparkling water showed up 20 minutes later. Once our food arrived, our server, Trenton never paid any attention to us. We had to ask another server for water refills. We ordered 3 Pizookies for the table and when we got our bill, we were charged full price. Pi day fell on a Tuesday, so Pizookies were already on special for $3 every Tuesday. Trenton told us the special is ""tomorrow."" We had to show him the email with the promo and even the menu said so... Then he took another 15 minutes to bring our bill back.

83,Mary A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,2017-05-13,"I eat at BJs frequently. Probably once a month or every couple of months. It has a large menu, usually not a long wait at this location, and it has better food than some competitors. This location in particular has always given me problems. Either the service is slow, they don't offer refills, etc. Not anything that I feel warrants a review. I am not a person who complains often. But what happened today is something that I feel people need to know. Today while we were eating lunch, my son was given his chicken tenders kids meal. This is something that he has eaten numerous times, and we have never had an issue. The worst that has happened is they have been lukewarm, presumably because they sit under a heat lamp while the other food is cooking. Again, not anything serious. I just had a baby, and I was distracted with tending to my baby. My husband cut up my son's chicken and he was not looking. My son took a bite of chicken and put it back down, and that's when I saw it. It was RAW. I mean, COMPLETELY raw. I freaked out and took all of the chicken off of his plate. I immediately got the waitress and she told the manager. The manager deflected responsibility, stating that the chicken comes precooked and it was an error with the supplier. And while that may or may not be true, I still do not understand how a chef can serve raw chicken, and to a child no less. Salmonella is no joke and it can be deadly for a toddler like my son. So you have to wonder, if the supplier gave them one raw piece of chicken, how many more are there? Why two stars and not one? The manager did try to remedy the situation. But I also felt like he didn't care that much. This is RAW poultry we are talking about. The kids meal was removed from my tab. But I feel like this is a mistake that is unforgivable. My son could get very sick, and now I need to play the waiting game. I wish that I had taken a picture, I am really angry at myself for not taking one. And yes, my husband should have paid more attention to my son's chicken. So should I. But when you eat at a restaurant, there are certain minimum expectations. Your food being cooked safely is one of them. Regardless of whether or not it was the supplier's fault, raw chicken should never have even come in contact with my son's plate. This is why I cannot in good faith ever return to BJs, and i cannot recommend it to anyone else. I wish that I didn't have to write this, but I feel that it is important for people to know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=60,2.56,2.72,2.904,1.9920000000000002,2.656

I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan of the food but it was my niece's graduation and she picked it so off we went.  We precalked in a reservation for 9 people and still had to wait an hour to be seated...  Once we were seated, I ordered potato skins and they came promptly with one set of silverware that I grabbed. I was lucky able to use the spoon for my skins and on my ranch.  My sister ordered wings as an appetizer and they came or shortly. I grabbed one with my fork, dipped it in the ranch and ate it. Then I grabbed a second one, took a bite and looked at it on the fork, and almost vomited, the fork was so dirty with multiple pieces of lettuce stuck to it. I took it to the counter showed the staff and a manager came out to apologize. Then they had me fill out an incident report.  In addition to that, my cousin's burger tasted like it was made out of salt.  My steak was so fatty and gross and well done I could only give it to the dog.  My little cousin who ordered of the kids meal, her mom was charged for the (included) drink.  My daughter requested an easy cheese pizza as she does not like meat (not allergic just preference). They brought extra cheese and pepperoni, we scrapped everything of and she ate the crust. The experience will not be repeated by me at that BJ's or any other because of what happened.  The cherry on the top was when one of the hostess said to me when I asked for clean silverware to replace my filthy set said, ""the fork went thru the sanitizer washer so you don't have anything to worry about."" I explained that it doesn't matter how many times you sanitizer it, if it's not clean, it's not sanitized. Edit: After I posted this review I was contacted by BJs and give a $50 e gift card.

We had a party of three, one being a toddler, when we arrived there were two parties ahead of us. The hostess took my name and said it would be about 10 mins, we went in at 10pm. It was a little busy, but all the other parties waiting were large. I figured this was the reason for only a 10 min wait because we were a small group. Between 10 and 10:30pm I watched 4 different groups be seated, 3 of which were groups of 3 who had checked in with the hostess after us. Finally at 10:32pm, the hostess looked at me and says, you're still waiting, I replied, ""yes, we are"", we were seated then.  By 10:45, almost 15 mins after sitting down, not a single employee came over to greet us, bring us water, or even say someone will be right with you. NOTHING! NOT A DAMN THING. When we got up to leave a waitress turns around and says have you been helped. I told her, ""no, we're leaving."" At the hostess station I asked to speak with a manager, explained him the situation and how horrible the customer service there is. His response, ""I'm sorry, thats all I can do for you.""

From San Jose to Elk Grove to this location in Sacramento near Arco Arena (sorry, I'm old school,) the dinning experience is pretty consistent. What does vary is the service and this visit here afforded us a wonderful waitress that was fast and genuinely concerned about our needs. This isn't always the case at BJ's.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. It was a healthy portion of pink meat that had a good flavor to it. This was a French Dip and thus it required dipping, right?  Into the Au Jus it went but not before I smothered the bread with all the white ""horseradish"" sauce. I love real horseradish for its flavor and spice. This had very little of either. Still, the sandwich was enjoyable. Even more enjoyable was the sweet potato fries which were few in number. Truthfully, I didn't mind since I was not in need of more calories.  Ya, BJ's is a nice place to get a really good beer and some good food along with the brew.

The employees here are doing an alright job for making the customers like me a fine service. I wish this service needs to be more friendly to the customers next time despite the busiest environment. As a result for me, no cons. Now onto the food! During my lunch break, I usually ordered one of my favorite dishes from BJ's called, ""Lemon Thyme Chicken."" As I ate it, it tasted very good although it was kinda nearly salty for my tastebuds. The cause for being close salty is the brussel sprouts. I'm sure they should reduce the salt content for the vegetable sides of the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The rest of them were also tasted amazing! The chicken breast did cooked perfectly without being too harden and nearly raw. Not a bad meal! There's plenty of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far.

I ask him for the receipt and before I even bring it up he says ""oh I'm sorry if it's short I just got change from the front"" he waited as I counted knowing darn well he had shorted me a few dollars. He tries and apologize and now it makes sense why he didn't bring my receipt. I got and speak to the front and he not only lied about getting change from the front but also stole from us. He brought back the right amount of change and we spoke to the manager and all she could say was thank you for letting me know so I can coach him.

After ordering our food at 6:30 pm about 10 minutes later our appetizer was out. Seemed like a great start, about 30 min later the waiter finally walked by and we had to ask her how long our food would be. She advised us 2/3 are ready and the third almost. After bringing 2 meals out another 30 min later still no third plate. We ordered a 4th dish and it came out within 10 minutes and still no 3rd dish. What really set it off is the waiter had the nerve to say that there is a large group they are catering to which is unacceptable. Your suppose to cater to first come basis not based on group size. The manager on duty Javier was very helpful after it was brought to his attention over an hour later.

I asked for more fire on the steak and they brought my steak back super burnt. So I just said forget it.. I will just take it home for my dogs to eat. The bill was $100 for 3 people.

I'm giving her the money we were a lot and we didn't want to give anyone a headache by telling them to split the check. So we all put our money unfortunately not all of us had cash so we made three separate transactions two cards and one cash. RENNE stated there's a gratuity when I know there is we don't just go and leave nothing. I ignored her first comment then she made that same comment twice that's when I thought I was being disrespected. I wrote a not to RENNE on the receipt in which it stated you don't have to repeat that there's a gratuity amount when I know there is one and that it was unacceptable that no where does it state I have to leave a tip. I personally gave her the receipt as soon as she read it and laughed she went looking for me and started to smirk. She made a comment like"" if they can't pay why do they come here"".

I grabbed a big piece of fish out of her taco and took a big wiff..ugggghh! Spoiled fish! We complained to server then I proceeded to go to the restroom to wash my stinky hand. Scrubbed deep with soap. Manager took responsibility and offered soup or whatever we may want.

When you say your gonna bring something, then bring it. Don't carry on a conversation with your coworkers about you weekends plans and forget your at work. Second listen to your patrons. When we have to repeat an order several times and your right next to the person, maybe you should get a hearing aid or maybe clean you ears. Lastly, if your food is cold when they bring it out, don't argue with the patron and ask them, ""Are you sure?"" Are you serious? Wow.

The last straw was this past Saturday.  We had family over and my husband wasn't feeling well so I recommend take out from BJs.  I had ordered the bison burger and upgraded my fries to sweet potato. The burger was bland (I get bison at other places so I know what a good one should taste like) and all the fries were pretty much burnt.  Glad I paid extra for burnt fries.  Someone ordered the mushroom burger and there were so many she took some off.  My husband ordered the ziti which he normally loves but he said it was like it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  Not sure if they have new cooks or management but this place is bad.

Not so at this location on a Monday afternoon when hardly anyone was in the joint. We headed to the bar for a beer and appetizers. The Bartender was talking to the one patron at the bar. We stood there ... and stood there ... and stood there ... for at least 7-8 minutes... less than 10 feet from the bartender. He never made eye contact or acknowledged us. He was too deep telling some story to the patron. We finally left, headed back to the host station and asked to be seated in the restaurant. There a server by the name of Michael took good care of us. Yet i still left with a bitter taste in my mouth -- and It wasn't from the BJ porter.

IT DIDN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE, my favorite part :(.   The potato fully loaded was subpar, but how could you mess up a potato. The broccoli... I didn't understand I usually LOVE ordering bjs broccoli for every meal, but this just didn't cut it, it tasted of mush. Now onto my macadamia pizookie..... hard as a rock!

I am big on customer service, so when I experience amazing customer service I love to give kudos, in hopes of  that employee receiving some recognition.  On Christmas Eve my family and I decided to go have some dinner and drinks, upon being seated we were greeted by our waitress Amelia. (Name may be misspelled). She was very approachable, sweet and genuine. She was very attentive to us and even chimed up with some conversation as well as suggestions. A couple people's food at our tables came way after the rest of us, maybe they forgot about us, but Amelia was apologetic and even comp us on some of our meals. Throughout the entire night she was very attentive, always coming by and seeing how we were doing. I greatly appreciate that type of service. I normally sit at the bar when I visit, but next time I may try and get one of her tables again. Hey, doesn't hurt she's a cute girl as well. Lol.
