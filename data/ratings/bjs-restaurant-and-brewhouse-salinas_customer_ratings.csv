190,Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26.0,4.0,2012-04-05,"I've been to many BJ's up and down California and when I found out that it was here in Salinas, I was pretty shocked. The place is a decent size and can fit parties, but not many. So expect a long wait if you do come with a party. This place is very ideal for couples or parties of 4 to 6.  The beers and pizookie is what draws me to BJ's all the time (and the Jambalaya). If you're not too sure on what beer to get (Nutty Brunette, Jeremiah Red, Piranha) I would suggest getting the flight of beers. It's a sample of most of their signature beers. Everything is pretty good on the menu, you can't go wrong with any of the items. The soups are really good, the burgers are good as well (Deep Fried Jalapeno Burger, add mushrooms and bacon), Jambalaya and the pizzas. If you're not too hungry on pizza I'll probably just order the mini, it's basically a four slice pizza, a good size especially if your trying to save room for dessert. Pizookie all day tho. The Chunky Chocolate Chip is really good and so is the Which Chocolate Macadamia  There are TVs everywhere so you won't be missing out on anything. The one thing though (not sure if it's because it's Salinas) but they do have a policy on weekdays at 12am they pull your alcohol off your table no matter how full it is. So you better drink fast. And on weekends probably goes the same, an hour after closing. A little FYI for you guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=180,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

396,Toney B.,"Salinas, CA",6,25,1.0,1.0,2012-04-09,"My Caesar salad was served and finished before the appetizer hit the table. The appetizer was nachos which were cold and barely edible. Our empty beer glasses were picked up without an offer of refill. We barely saw our sever and the entrees were also barely warm. We expressed our concern. All this after a 45 minute wait to be seated!  Give them a couple months to get their act together. 12/30/12 UPDATE:  Despite my commitment to the contrary, we went here tonight ONLY because our daughter received a free meal certificate as a scholastic achievement award and she was bent on using it. We went early to avoid the long wait we had experienced before.  To our surprise we were seated immediately in a nearly empty restaurant... and then waited for quite a while before our server arrived to take our order. We placed our drink, appetizer and entree order at the same time since we had had more than enough time to peruse the menu.  Our daughter's lemonade arrived shortly but we had a while longer to wait before our beer arrived.  30 minutes later I had to ask our server to check on the status of our appetizer. 10 minutes later it arrived,at which time we had to ask for our eating utensils and napkins, followed by our entrees less than a minute later.  Apparently the kitchen staff is not aware of, or does not have access to a stove, oven, or hot table!  Have you ever eaten COLD, soft ""crispy"" calamari?  YUM!!!  The puffed up dough ball of a pizza our daughter was served was pale, dough-white, no-trace-of-browning bread that had something resembling strands of half melted cheese lightly sprinkled atop a few cold pepperoni slices!  We both had the jalapeño burger with potato wedges.  The wedges were hot and awesome.  The burgers... tasteless, cold and most definitely NOT spicy. I swear to you that it was like eating a MacD's quarter pounder...  WITHOUT THE FLAVOR OF A QUARTER POUNDER!  Where in hell do you find jalapeños that are tasteless?  Anybody? The beer was good and that is the only reason they get 1 star... well that and apparently I cannot give them 0 stars.

We would suggest calling ahead to find out about wait times. Our server was great and very prompt with our beers and taking our order.  We order the jambalaya and pasta dish and both items were tasty.

308,Marc M.,"Salinas, CA",75,53,3.0,4.0,2012-04-28,"I went here the first weekend that it opened. Actually this would be my first time being at Bj's and lucky me, they opened one close to my area.  So being the first weekend, it was guaranteed to be packed. Friday night a lot of locals want to try something new in the area. Waiting time was 2+ hours especially if your party has 6 or more.  Like I said, this is my first time being at a Bj's so I'm not sure how others looked like, but this one was really great. Even with the full house, it was set up nicely. But I'm not sure if having security was standard, or it's just in Salinas? I'm not sure.. but either take it as being safe while eating your pazookie! LOL! Oh yeah, WTF? Pazookie?? It feels like they just baked a cookie and straight put ice cream on top! Damn!! But that was genius!!!!! Service was great, but my friend didn't think so. LOL! Since the bar was packed with drunk people, unfortunately her beer sampler was lost within the crowd! LOL! I think she was just upset because her order came in last when she ordered first out of everyone. But the waiter was very apologetic and very nice. She made sure to try to get our orders to us right away after that. Also, I'm not really sure about the service that walks between the aisle. I understand that they have to take your plates and glasses so there would be more room on the table, but damn! Let me finish my drink first!!!  Food, well I just shared a chicken potato with my friend, because we're really just into drinking that night. But the beers were great. We tried the blondes and the brunettes (I'm a brunette kinda guy) and they were good. (Common sense, blondes for light beer and brunette for dark beer) We also tried the seasonal beer which was Oasis. That was great. Got two pitchers of those! All in all, This place would be a regular place to hang out and chill right after work or just have dinner with friends. Happy hour is between 3pm-7pm at the bar Monday thru Friday (well that's what the waitress told me) So it's perfect!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=300,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
295,Kari D.,"Seaside, CA",10,108,12.0,3.0,2012-04-30,"Went here last night and it was PACKED. Thats not unusual, BJ's is a great restaurant and it is pretty new. I've been to several on the West Coast and was really happy that they opened one in the area.  When we got there, it was about 5:30..yes pretty early for dinner to me. It was packed as hell and I think the space between the revolving door and the hostess counter is too small. Since a lot of people came with like 12 + people in their party it was quite a wait to even ask for a table. But since it was just the 2 of us, we were seated in 15 min. What attracts us to B'J's is the beer, and the food. DUH. But its cool that they are also a brewery, so we can taste the different types of beer thats not mainstream, as my boyfriend and I are broadening our horizons. Anyways, one of the the beer that is ""back"" for a limited time is the oasis amber. We asked our server what he could compare it to, what it tastes like. He had no idea and couldn't suggest anything. We ordered it anyway and recieved it 15 min later...which is whatever but we tasted it, and it was not exactly an oasis...it tasted bland and had no summery notes, no citrus, hops just nothing. Wish we would have known...I was hoping for like a longboard, landshark or lost coast type of beer.  We got our food, but they forgot my salad, I got it and then 15 minutes later they came back with the same salad. Pizza was good as usual. They do need to improve the service, of all the B'J's I've been to, San Jose is still my favorite and if they are going to sell and brew their own beer, the servers need to be knowledgable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=280,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

426,Kyreen C.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,2012-05-09,"Says on the website that they take reservations, so I called a week in advanced to try and book a table for 15-20 people. The hostess that answered said they are not currently taking reservations till the end of June and instead to call and utilize the ""call ahead system"". But in order to use the call ahead system we'd have to have a party of 9 or smaller. So how does that suggestion help? It doesn't since obviously I was calling for a party of 15-20. So I was then transferred to guest services and had the same unhelpful information regurgitated to me by yet another employee. And when I told them that the website states that they take reservations, I was told that they will speak to the manager about that ""error"". But that another option would be to  send someone from our party an hour before we expect to arrive to wait for seating. Seriously? Get your act together people. You are running a BJ's franchise, at least run it to standards. This place needs to hire more knowledgeable employees that knows a little something about customer service.

294,David L.,"Salinas, CA",0,16,,3.0,2012-05-19,"My wife and I had lunch here yesterday.  It was about 11:30 on a Friday and we were seated right away!  Our waiter was friendly and attentive and our drinks arrived promptly (my soda was a little on the flat side but tolerable).   It was about 25 minutes after we ordered that I looked at my watch and mentioned to wife that I hoped it wouldn't be too much longer.  Suddenly, a manager appeared and apologized for the delay.  The odd thing was that we hadn't complained and I didn't really think that 25 minutes was that excessive.  Did he see me look at my watch or does he just routinely apologize to everyone?  Then our waiter came and also appoligized and asked if he could get my wife a second glass of wine... I had the lunch special with 1/2 grilled California grilled chicken sandwich and chicken tortilla soup.  The soup was excellent but the portion was way too small.  The sandwich was good but a bit on the soggy side and the bread was so soft that my fingers poked though.   I requested fruit instead of fries.  They were obvioulsy from a can so I won't be having that again.  My wife had a lunch flatbread pizza with salad that I also thought was kind of on the small side.   Next time we'll get some appetizers first. When the bill came, my wife was suprised that she was charged for the second glass of wine - she thought the offer was a comp.  She pointed that out to waiter and he had it removed from the bill without any hassle (we gave him a nice tip).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=280,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

They gave gramps one of those Irish Coffee skinny mugs for his coffee he gave it a try but it hit him in the nose and it was too dainty for his working man fingers. After a search and explanation that the regular coffee mugs were all broken one was found, irate employee went crazy? They also brought my soup &salad entree as an appetizer so the soup got cold and the grandparents fussed over wanting me to eat while we waited for their entrees. The chicken tortilla soup was quite good. They made a big deal about pouring it from a cup to the plate that had the chicken & cheese mounded in the middle but then submerged the fresh  lime in it so I couldn't really squeeze it without getting soup fingers. The salad was a basic bland iceberg with a couple tomato and cucumbers slices. I got the creamy garlic dressing as it was the closest pairing for the soup. It was very bland compared to the soup so I put a huge amount of pepper in it to give it some kick. I know this is nit picky but the holes in the pepper shaker were ridiculously small, it took me a good 20-30 seconds to get enough out lol.  The grands decided on pot roast.   Gramps got the open faced version and Grams got the entree version. Salad is $2.50 extra I think, so they didn't get any. Looking at the two meals I'd get the sandwich and just not eat the bread since it was $3-4 cheaper for the same food. The pot roast was very tender the mushroom gravy was flavorful but salty. The mashed potatoes were odd to me. Dense and oddly dry even though you know there is a ton of fat in them. The roasted veggies were kinda lifeless looking. Seemed more steamed than roasted none of that carmelized burnt edges that make roasted veggies so tasty. Positives were that the staff was friendly, the decor was very nice and clean so far, the menu was huge and had a nice variety. I do want to try it at another point when I can splurge a bit more on calories since most of the entrees were over  1200 kcals easily. I'd actually like to split one of their deep dish pizzas with one of their ""award winning""  brand of beers. Grams thought they would have had a brewery setup like the Monterey  Brew Pub but I assume it's all done centrally and shipped. I'm pretty curious as to wether they're owned by the same company as PF Changs Cheesecake Factory or CPK. Feels very much like that style of elegance for the masses. I'm hoping that after another month they'll get it together and I think it'll be a good addition for Salinas.

358,Local consumer C.,"Salinas, CA",80,55,26.0,2.0,2012-05-29,"I really want to love this place. I really do! I've been here at least 5 times since they've opened. I try different times to see how well their service is even when they are slow. This place needs to get their act together and hire some quality help. These long waits (even when it's not busy) is unacceptable. I'll be complaining to headquarters today about our experiences there. I've even tried their call-ahead seating and that doesn't even help! If you call and ask how long the wait is, they'll say it's 30 minutes only to find out that you have to wait another 30 minutes when you get there. I get that it bumps you up on the list to call ahead, but the person answering the phone should clearly state that when asked how long is the wait! This last time we went there, a family of four, and the place was not even half to three quarters full and we had NO wait to be seated. But we didn't see our dinner until 60 minutes after we were seated. Apparently, (according to our server), they are required to bring out the food all together. So, the pizza was hot out of the oven but the rest of the food was cold as ice cubes! Then upon complaining that the two burger meals were cold, it took another 25 minutes to get that! So, two of us were done eating and had to watch the other two eat. And during that 25 minute wait, our server never came back to check on us to see if we needed drink refills. After waiting 20 minutes, I went up to ask to speak with one of the THREE managers and I stood there waiting for 10 minutes and they still didn't come out after they were requested. The food eventually arrived so I sat back down. The server was so frustrated at how the kitchen was putting out the food that he said if it doesn't get better that he'd be quitting his job. I felt bad for him. Of course, they are good about comping for meals, which is their only salvation at this point. But after wasting 2.5 hours of our evening there just to eat dinner, and having similar experiences all 5 times that I've been there, I'm not sure that I will come back soon!

We waited about an hour for our food.  Even then, it came out in phases.  The waitress said this was due to the fact two of the meals had been dropped in the kitchen.  I'm guessing the waitress forgot to put our tag in when she took the order. The manager came out (at the end, when we were paying) to see how things were going.  I told him it was way too slow.  He clapped his hands, said something about getting ""this show on the road"" and walked away like that was gonna help. Parts of the meal were OK, but it was mostly lacking.  My BBQ beef sandwich was slapped together, and looked unprofessional.  The fries were cold.  The sodas were all ice, with a sip or two of soda between refills.  My companions reported similar issues with their burgers and fries, including overdone meat. I've had to-go pizza from BJ's a couple times and it was excellent.  That's why I was so shocked at the horrible experience I had in the actual restaurant.  I've heard that the Salinas BJ's is having issues keeping a decent manager and the whole restaurant suffers for it.  From what I saw, I wouldn't find that hard to believe.

279,Irene S.,"Monterey, CA",1166,565,,5.0,2012-06-26,"I love eating here! I am so thrilled that finally there is a BJ's Brewhouse in the Monterey County.  Before, I had to go further north to eat at one of these restaurants.  Like at all BJ's Brewhouses that I have been to, the selection of food is great, the prices are reasonable, the food is consistently tasty, the atmosphere is trendy but classy, and the service is always friendly. Some of their restaurants in the further Northern regions of California have received awards. I especially love the pizza here.  There is a great selection of pizzas including a veggie one that is low calorie.  During happy hour, all the mini pizzas are half off- a great deal!  There is even a selection on the menu just devoted to low calorie meals- and these meals are not bland at all! I have had the pork, and the Thai fish. Both are very filling and tasty.  I also love the $6 quisadilla lunch special.  Yummy!!! - A price of an entree appears to range from $6 to about $15.   My boyfriend loves the large selection of ales that are available.  During Happy Hour, I believe there are deals on beer and ale.   I would also recommend trying one of their Pazookie desserts- these consist of one large cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. I love the Ghireradelli Pazooki.  Although, now that I am eating healthier, I rarely have such desserts. By the way, if you subscribe to their free e-newsletter, you can get a free  complementary pazookie dessert on your birthdays! Pros: -franchise restaurant with great food, prices and service consistently -has rewards program and e-newsletter that sends coupons regularly  -great selection of low calorie entrees -large selection of ales and beers including seasonal brews -unique dessert - the pazookie   -good deals during happy hour Cons: -Nothing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=260,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.516,2.76

I'm kinda tired of eating at the regular spots in town like Ginos, Ellies, Outback or Smalleys. Not that there's anything wrong with them. I've been to BJ's in Arizona and it was great. I only have a couple mild complaints. First, when they came with my dinner, I had the 12oz steak and baked potatoe. The potatoe was massive! It took up half of the plate. They only give a micro spoonful of butter. It would only cover 1/3 of the potatoe. I asked for more and they still only gave me the same amount, so basically I could barely cover half of it. Don't be stingy with the butter! Also, they are a little slow as far getting your meal in a timely manner. It also seems like the waiters and waitresses are a little overwhelmed. I will go back for sure because I love their food. I will probably wait a couple of months though to give them more time to perfect things. We should give them a little break since they are still so new. Great atmosphere! I do like the fact that they have security there. It is Salinas after all. It's unfortunate that they need it, but we don't want the dumbass gang members ruining BJ's like they did Fridays.

The service was extremely slow and we never saw the waiter except to take our order and give us the bill.  The calamari appetizer was extremely small and came out as one lump rather than individual pieces. My bacon cheeseburger had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever but I managed to literally choke down half of it. Another guest's order was not correct but was resolved quickly. The 'deep dish pizza' was about two inches of dough and hardly any cheese or sauce. The salad dressing was very tangy.  At the end of the meal the waiter asked if I wanted a to go box for my picked apart burger. I told him that it was not good and that there wasn't any flavor. His immediate response was, ""Do you want to speak with a manager?"" Whereas I would normally applaud this question he did not apologize and I was still extremely hungry but it would have been pointless or order something else as the other guests were done eating.  For dessert we ordered the pizookie sampler since we had heard so much about it but I was not impressed.

Now the food...we started off with an appetizer of Crispy Calamari ($9.75) served with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli.  Presentation was wannabe pretentious, however, the calamari was overcooked, chewy with enough fried crispy crumbs (yo ho Long John Silvers) to nearly outnumber the calamari pieces.  Ok, so they have some great advertised lunch specials starting at $5.95 - Big On Flavor, Small On Price!  Depending on what you order it's more like Meh On Flavor, WTF On Price.  I literally had to follow-up this tiny meal of Half Flatbread Pizza with Salad ($6.95) with a Costco Hot Dog one hour later cuz I was still hungry.  The Flatbread Pizza was AGAIN overcooked/burned, tasteless and tasted more like a Saltine Cracker.  Despite being in the ""salad bowl of the world"" the salad was literally a small handful of mixed greens, mushy tomatoes, few carrot slivers, sprinkling of onions, and one cucumber slice wouldn't satisfy an anorexic!  Once again served on this over sized wannabe pretentious platter. My dining companion ordered the Southern Fried Chicken ($5.95) and reported being satisfied with her meal of  a small buttermilk fried chicken breast, pepper cream gravy, mashed potatoes and corn and fire-roasted red pepper succotash all layered on top of each other...wannabe pretentious once again. They do have some AYCD handcrafted old fashion soda's ($2.95) which are very nice.  The cream soda was divine and the root beer brought back some sweet childhood memories of days gone by when soda was cool!

I figured there wouldn't be anything on TV other than election coverage, so we went to Salinas to meet some friends there for dinner.

The server just said that she hadn't heard anything about it, and when my wife showed her the offer on her phone, she said she'd ask the manager. I don't think that ever happened. We never heard anything more on the subject. Not a big deal, but it seems like a pretty shady way to get people in the door. The other thing that annoyed me was that it was so dark that we could barely read the menu. Either use bigger, bolder print, or turn the damn lights up. I haven't had that problem there before even though it never seems very brightly lit, but it was all of us. Not just me. Those pendant lights in the booths only seem to light up a six inch diameter circle in the middle of the table. Food and drinks were fine, but my wife ordered a pizza and they left off the tomatoes. It wasn't any kind of special order or anything, just a regular menu item. You'd expect that they could at least get their own menu items correct with no special requests. There was little if any sauce on the pizza, so it really could have used those tomatoes. Service was good, but a little slow considering that there were more employees than customers.

But for some reason the wonderful smell and flavor quickly faded and I was left with an old, malty tasting IPA. The brown, porter, and stout were not my style either. Ok for style but I personally prefer a bit more carbonation and body on my porters and stouts. The brown was a bit sweet for me as well. We had a deep dish pizza. The fist one brought was incorrect and the staff corrected the mistake rather quickly. The dough reminded me of a biscuit more than a pizza. I kept wondering if it was made by Pillsbury to be honest.

Ive been here a few times...and i would have liked to gone more if it were like any other bjs but its not. My first experience was when it first opened, it was fine for being a new. My server had his tray tipped and spilt a good part of my martini on my friend. which i thought was funny bc my friend was wearing board shorts and the guy was really nice about. He was very attentive to serving out table and talked to us a bit. I had calamari and it was delicious. Then, i came here again with my sister, we werent carded for our martinis our food was hardly warm and calamari was soggy and gross but whatever .that happens sometimes, i get it. I came here again about 3 weeks ago with my sister. We wanted to sit outside bc it was a nice day, they brought us to the patio and we were by ourselves the whole time out there. I had 2 martinis and my sister had one. my server mumbled the whole time but my sister and i just figured she was new, she hardly checked in with us and didnt bring us our food, some guy did and he also got me my second martini. good guy :). sooooo after she brought my second martini she ran off and i had to loudly say ""Excuse me"" before she left the patio so i could ask for some utensils, napkins, water and to order some stuffed mushrooms (which were gross and soggy with way too much sauce in it)...she brought me these things what seemed like as slow as possible.  I guess it was the supervisor who asked us if everything was ok, and we figured she was just new so we said everything was great. Im pretty petite and not much of a drinker so we walked to target and bought some things, i couldnt find my debit in which i used to pay for our stuff at bjs, so i used a credit card and then went to the bank to withdraw money, and then i searched my car in the parking lot. Couldnt find it, so i called bjs...i guess they looked at this point i feel like they probably didnt really and just checked their hostess area to see if one was turned in. About 5 oclock i get a text from chase fraud saying my bill was more than it shouldve been and i had other suspicious activity.I checked my account online and say that BJs had charged me more and apparently i spent 60$ at shell, $30 at mcdonals, and  $10 at CVS. So i called bjs and the supervisor ken was pretty cool about my suspicions as to who i thought might of taken it and he said he would call me right after he talked to her. He called me a few hours later and said he couldnt get a hold of her and would try later. I waited 3 days til i finally called him back. He told me she didnt do it, and i asked him how he knew and he told me ""Bc i asked her and she said no"" ....um ok that sounds legit if i stole someones card i would most likely say no also....this is kind of upsetting. ""So why didnt you call me back to say this?"" ""uhhh bc i had a few days off and i just didnt get around to it"" EXCUSE ME BUT I BELIEVE MY CARD GOT STOLEN AT YOUR RESTAURANT. so at this point i was really upset regardless if it was a lie or not youre making excuses for your lack of supervising skills and someone due to the circumstances seems like she really took my card... He gave me the GMs info. I guess his name is Eric or something rather. He called me back right a few minutes after i filed a police report. I told him i wouldnt have done this if i felt like my situation wasnt handled so poorly. I told him if i were Ken i would have not waited for me to call him back, i wouldve comped my meal and had me come back again for another free meal.(maybe) bc regardless if she stole it or not, the service has more than most times been crappy and customers come first, especially if they were polite to begin with. Eric said he was very sorry and made excuses for ken and this girl and proceeded to tell me about very personal tragedies about her life ( i would be pissed if i were her) and um isnt that like illegal?? and said he would mail me a gift card...which i never got either? im not going to call and ask for his excuse for that one is... he gives me a call a few days later, i call him back the next day and im on hold for over 5 mins. i hang up, they are not even worth my time at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=380,1.8,1.8,1.8,2.34,1.8000000000000003

He showed up and was fairly nice though seemed uninterested to be talking to us (looking around the bar while we were ordering our drinks, little to no eye contact or smile). I asked if he could change one TV to the NHL Conference Final game instead of sports highlight... After the second time I asked he told me ""I am busy.. I will ask the manager when I get a chance"". We watched him clean tables, talk to other staff members, walk past the manager a dozen times (manager was standing on the floor) and no game. BJ's food is ok.. what will keep me from ever going again is the service. With all the options out there I can go be ignored somewhere else with better food...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=220,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.184,2.4

The second attempt was mediocre and all around a huge disappointment.  I really don't know what went wrong as we have enjoyed our previous two experiences as well as friends who frequent BJ'S.  I doubt very much whether I will put myself through the same experience again, I think I will just give it a miss in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=420,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.084,2.36

Now, 2 years later, it's to the point my family and I don't even want to waste our time. The food is still pretty good, but everything else has gone noticeably downhill. The hostesses are usually friendly, but service is sorely lacking. Recent 'highlights' have included a appetizer served post-entree, and a entree arriving before silverware/napkins.  What BJ's does still have going for it is the food taste is still good, and the drinks are still drinks. Take out orders were consistently found to have errors or missing components. Sadly we'll be crossing BJ's off our list for family dinner night until this place can get back to how it used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=240,2.4,2.45,2.45,2.024,2.43

He went along side to where I could see through the window the entire waiting staff hanging out in the patio area.  Once he did return to take us to a table he basically ran to the table as my girl and I walked behind him. He had a huge smile on his face as he said your waiter will be right with you. Of course he went back to the patio.  From the moment we sat down we had many servers pass us by not even aknowledging us. Wouldn't even look at us or the couple behind us nor the large group next to us. About fifteen minuetes later we simple gave up and walked out.

The ONLY reason I gave the rating of one is because the food wasn't that bad and the staff appeared to be friendly....However, the lack of service and the very slow service wipes out the friendliness of the staff. If the food wasn't decent, I would give a flat ZERO stars.  So, I reserved a party for up to 20. It ended up being about 12 or 13. I understand that sometimes larger parties are harder to handle and sometimes a little slower. But, the restaurant was kind of dead. We actually had up to 3 waiters at our party, which actually made it worse. Two people received pretty decent service, 4 others ok service and the others were left wondering what we need to do to get service. For most of the dinner, we have empty appetizer plates and empty glasses. Two guests waited about 30 min for dinner. Mind you, the restaurant was NOT busy. I also never received an appetizer plate I ordered. I was so disgusted towards the end of the evening I had to voice my concern to the manager. THIS is where I REALLY got irritated after the initial dinner.  So, I went to the hostess desk and I asked for the manager on duty. I voiced my concern with the manager and stated that they waiters seem very nice and friendly, but the service has been very slow and that my party is constantly waiting for orders and drinks and the mood at the table is a little low. He said that doesnt sound normal and that he would check with the kitchen and staff. I said thank you and went back to the table. We were there probably about 20 minutes after that and the manager NEVER came to talk to me to resolve my issues. Perhaps he assumed since we were done he didn't need to bother? We were only done because the service was HORRIBLE and we didn't want to stay or spend any more money there.

We were seated, the server comes over...starts wiping the table (although it was already clean) and talking trash about the busser and how he never does a good job. Seems like he wanted to present himself as the good guy. Anyway, server asks what we would like to drink- my BF order's a type of beer called the nutty brunette, in which the server looks at me and tells my BF it looks like he already has one. I'm not one to typically get offended but this server was already very ODD & getting on my nerves. 20 minutes passes. No sign of our server. No water. No beer. No order taken.  We ask to be moved. Again, the beer my BF ordered still hadn't come. We had THREE different people come over, one went to check on the beer, another took our order, and the third came to see if we had been helped.

Order drinks, wait a minimum of 10 minutes for drinks to arrive. Ready to order? If you asked your server to give you a minute please expect to wait at least 5-10 minutes. Food is ordered, wait a minimum of 30-40 minutes for your meal to arrive.  Thirsty? Or did you drink your entire beverage? Good luck getting a refill. Feel free to track down a server (or your own) and tell them to bring you another - asking results in a forgotten refill. Food finally arrives! Tastes amazing! It's consumed within 5 minutes...Still thirsty though. Finished eating, wait a minimum of 20 minutes for check to arrive. Ready to pay, wait a minimum of 10 minutes for card to come back so you can tip (if you think they deserve anything), and get the heck out of there!

The kitchen should know what goes on a meal's plate, and both of our entrees were missing key components. The kitchen missed the mashed potatoes on my dinner, and the horseradish sauce for my husband's French Dip. The server who delivered our meals was not our original server, and not only was oblivious to the incomplete plates; he did the drop and vanish approach to serving. It took several minutes to get a server's attention, and finally our server came over to see what we needed; we explained about the missing components and she took our plates back to fix them. When they were brought back, the main part of the meal was lukewarm, the only item served at the proper temperature was my mashed potatoes.

It was just after 10 AM and the restaurant was mostly vacant. Our hostess attempted to seat us at a table that was covered by smudge marks. I requested to be seated at another table and she complied.  Our server arrived about 5 minutes after being seated and she appeared to be overwhelmed. We should have gotten up at this point and gone somewhere else. We were waiting for someone to join us, and therefore there was a delay on our part. However, our drink order was slow, cream and sugar was not available or offered for our coffee, and the server looked like she was on the brink of a nervous breakdown.  Our order was ""finally"" taken and it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to the time our food started to arrive. Our drinks were not refilled and I discovered that one of our napkins, given by our hostess rolled with silver ware, was dirty. The restaurant was still empty and I couldn't see why we were not getting adequate service and a prompt pace. The table next to us seemed equally frustrated as we were. Our food arrived and one entree arrived 5 minutes after all others. This added a further delay and frustration to our experience. Someone claiming to be the Manager visited our table during this period. He mentioned that he ""just""arrived and learned that we had waited for an unreasonably long time for our meals. He apologized and promised to make it up. He asked us if we needed anything and I said Yes, refills on our drinks. Our table had empty glasses, empty plates, and we had been there for 1 1/2 hours.  I place the blame on the management and inexperienced servers. I felt compelled to pull the manager aside and inform him of what our expectations were. I opted not, because I wanted to remain ""civil"" for the remainder of our visit. I suggest you close one day and have a training session with your staff and perhaps fundamental training for the management. Everything was way off. I would like to explain it all, but I feel that I should not because it is not my responsibility to train you or your staff. I am however, compelled to share my experience via Yelp to let you and others how subpar of an establishment you are running. Lastly, it is an insult to have your servers pick up their tip while the table is still occupied. The only reason we left a tip was out of respect and pity. Won't be back to this Bj's.

Nice. The girl that dropped it off then asked if we wanted real menus. Uh, we already ordered. Anyhow, our real server was finally found and her excuse was that she was new. I don't even know what that means. I think no one was assigned to that table we were at and she was just given the table to cover, but that's just me.

We arrived at noon, and the place was less than half full.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our pancakes with eggs and bacon. The bacon was undercooked and soggy.  My pancakes looked golden and fluffy, until I Iifted one to butter them. Underneath, they were burned... crispy critter burned. So were my husband's.  It took a while to flag down the waitress, and she immediately apologize and said she'd order new ones.  We got tired of waiting, so I scraped off the tops of the pancakes to eat them. Almost 10 minutes later, our pancakes arrived. They were raw inside.  We flagged down our server who apologized profusely. I reassured her it wasn't her fault, but that the cook needed to go back to pancake school.  She took our plates away ""to show the manager"".  We had to wait another 10 minutes and the manager did come to our table.  He comped our meals, except $2.50 for the coffee.  That was very nice of him, as we would have paid for our eggs.  So, five stars for customer service.   We gave our server $20 in cash, and she asked if we wanted change. Um, yeah... she was nice, but not THAT nice!  We got shorted .50 but we let it go and we did tip her based on what our meal would have cost @20%.

We liked the breading on the outside, but the inside artichoke was soft. We are accustomed to fresh artichokes in this area, still it was good for a change. I got the chicken wings appetizer for my meal. I liked that there was no breading on them. I got the extra hot sauce for them, which I thought was only mild, but I liked it. Also their BBQ sauce. Couldn't eat it all. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I must say, though, that the most memorable thing about our visit was the excellent service we received from our waiter, Adonis.

Waited another ten minutes for someone to arrive at the table.  Actually, I needed to summons someone by raising my hand and shaking it in the air until I say wait staff.  The fact that I had to wait after being seated was utterly confusing because, while I was waiting to be seated, there were always three or four of the wait staff hovering around the hostess desk looking like they needed something to do.  At last a very nice member of the wait staff (Missy) arrived at our table.  After she took my drink order and delivered it to the table, I overheard another member of the wait staff ask her if she wanted to keep our table or not.  I am not sure why since no one else was interested in helping.  Maybe the person that asked was supposed to be the server.  Who knows but the staff is in clear need of training. On to the food (after more waiting and the dinnerware finally arriving):  the menu is ok and quite similar to a Chili's or Applebee's with a wider selection of beer and slightly higher prices.  I ordered something call the top sirloin.  The portion of the steak was on the small side for the price and a bit salty.  The portion of the two sides that accompany the meal was downright sad.  I received on scope of a rice pilaf concoction the flavor or, um, salt and about eight very tired and very old and wrinkly pieces of asparagus that did not have the woody ends cut from them and overwhelmingly tasted like, you guessed it, salt.   On to the meal of the other's in the party:  one wrong and one inedible.  On the milder side, on order arrived with the incorrect side dish.  The server allowed the diner to keep the incorrect one and promptly arrived with the correct one.  The most abysmal meal was the one that could not be eaten, a mahi mahi dish.  When it arrived, the diner asked if it was salmon because of the very strong fishy smell.  The serve advised that it was mahi mahi and that if it were the salmon it would have been a larger portion.  An odd thing to say to a customer.  At any rate, there was a short-lived attempt to eat the mahi mahi because the first bit was promptly spit into one of the small drink napkins provided.  I was asked to taste it and, after seeing the reaction after a full bite, requested only a flake of fish, which was quite enough.  The mahi mahi tasted old, metallic, and somewhat fermented.  When Missy arrived back at the table apologized and took a new order.  The manager eventually arrived at the table as well stating he was sorry and that they were trying to find out how long the mahi mahi had been around and how it had been handled during its time at BJs.   The second dish arrived and was consumed.  From what I was told and overheard being told to Missy, it was good.  I did not try any nor was I at the table while it was being eaten.  I was in the nicely tiled bathroom violently defecating my meal.   At any rate, after two unconfirmed cases of food poisoning I received no discount from the bill, will not be returning BJ's ever again, and cannot recommend dining there either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=300,2.36,2.44,2.44,1.7960000000000003,2.408

At first I thought we were super lucky - after being told they were on a 10-15 minute wait, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Waitress checked in to let me know she'd be right with us, and after 5 or so minutes she was. We were being patient as it was Saturday night, and it was busy (my wife and I both worked restaurant jobs as kids, so we get it). Drinks came relatively quickly, then we placed our order. 10 minutes later our original waitress told us she was going on a meal break and introduced our new server. Then we waited for over an hour for our food. When we were finally able to flag down our waitress, she apologized and went to find out what happened to our order. A few minutes later my wife's food and my youngest son's food were brought to the table. Then my dish and my oldest son's fries came out, but no entrée for him (did I mention it was his 12th birthday?). Over three minutes later his food came out. By this time my wife had summoned the manager, who was having a rough night. He was very apologetic and did comp our food. This place is huge, and I think they have just too much going on - they offer call-in order service and they bring it to your car in specified parking spots.

283,Steven C.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,1.0,2015-12-15,"The only reason I'm giving this particular location a star at all, is because I have to. It was horrible, to say the least. And we've been to MANY BJs across the U.S. First, our server Robert seemed lazy and untrained on how to correctly do his job. We ordered two waters and calamari to start. Calamari came out cold and was missing the dipping sauces. Told the server, he said he'd refire it and we also ordered chips and queso to go along with it. We then placed entree orders (guac burger, hickory brisket burger). We waited and waited and waited for the new calamari, and mind you we were still waiting on the chips and queso (which should come out before, it doesn't take that long) and we never NEVER got water refills. (We had to get our food runner to grab them). So new calamari comes out (much better this time) but old calamari dish (with calamari still on it) is still on the table. We eat calamari. Slide to the side with other dish. Chips and queso comes out 15 minutes later than the calamari, along with the burgers. (Calamari plates still there). Chips and queso were cold but we suffered through it. My burger (hickory brisket) was missing the BRISKET of all things and had no mayo on it. Fiancé's burger (guac) was missing the chipotle mayo on it. We got the stuff we needed about 10 minutes later so we were eating the cold chips and queso. So we add our toppings and cut the burgers in half (calamari plates get taken away finally) and the burgers are raw (we order medium well) and cold. So we tell the server, he brings the manager over, we tell him, we get it taken care of. The server has redeemed himself at this point, he seems less lazy and more friendly. So, to top it off, it's my birthday and I ordered a chocolate chunk pizookie. So I'm guessing the theme of the night was cold and raw because my pizookie was just complete dough with ice cream on top. The dish it comes in (usually unbearably hot) isn't even warm. So, I'd have to say, all in all, this was the most horrific experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my entire life, worldwide (because I've traveled and even third world countries had better food and service).  So, I'll never return to BJs, at least this location (which sucks because we love BJs and the area as we're going to be here often for work). Sorry for the long post, but someone needed to know. (We ripped our waiter Robert 20% of what the original bill should've been because we were giving him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he was overwhelmed with the three tables he had, who by the way, we're just as upset with service as us because he kept forgetting their food/drinks from the bar and refills).

Walked in, stood right in front of the podium to check in. My two teenage girls went straight to the bathroom so I stood by myself. Enter two families/parties behind me who are asked for their names and how many in their party as I'm ignored. Finally, I say, ""excuse me but I believe I was here first and have been standing here."" She looks at me and without acknowledgement that she just put others ahead of me asks for my name and tells me there will be a 25 minute wait. No, don't think so. Lucky for me my girls came in while I parked the car and put their name on the list. We were seated rather quickly because of this.  We order chicken lettuce wraps as appetizer. They came out in a reasonable time and were delicious. However, we had to get up and find our server to ask for appetizer plates after attempting to eat juicy messy lettuce wraps over a napkin. I don't recommend it. I order ribeye with side of asparagus and side of Brussels sprouts and abportobello mushroom asparagus starter salad with NO CRANBERRIES AND NO PEPITAS.  Going low carb. Salad and dinner arrives at the same time (weird) and I'm given a steak (overcooked - definitely not medium), asparagus and a friggin plain dried out overcooked baked potato!  Had to send it back because I definitely cannot eat a starchy dry baked potato (if I'm going to eat it, it's going to at least have a little butter).  While waiting for that, I start on my salad,  no cranberries and dressing on side as ordered but PEPITAS all over the place. I spent the next several minutes while waiting for my dinner with the right sides picking out pepita seeds. I didn't want to send that back also. The girls received their spaghetti and meatballs and chicken Alfredo without incident, thank goodness. In the end, the food was okay, our server Brian tried (he even noticed I had a mountain of PEPITAS on the side of my plate and said he told them to HOLD them, but they didn't).  We didn't get a water refill (the only thing we  were drinking since we cut out sugary drinks).  In the end, this place is mediocre at best and perhaps new management or serious training could help whip this place into shape. Attention to details matters in this industry. 2 stars is the absolute best I could give this BJ's. The worst BJ's location I've been to which is sad because I actually live nearby this one.

We were seated after a few minutes,  but left at the table without someone to take our drink order for over 10 minutes. By the time Javier came over to us we were all ready to order, not just drinks but also or meal. 2 beers, 2 waters,  a soda and a coffee were ordered along with a burger (well done), pasta, fried chicken and the rib eye (medium). After 10 more minutes the waiter come to let my husband know they were out of the beer he ordered. Still no other drinks. Slowly after the soda arrived. Still no water,  coffee or beer. The beer and water eventually showed up. No coffee. It seriously took over 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee. We've all had slow service before,  but this is ridiculous. Then the meal comes. Well done burger is medium at best, medium rib eye (mind you, this is over $20) is so raw is purple and on the verge of being bloody, and the succotash is chewy, old and cold. Jesse, the manager came by and asked how our dinner was. We were honest. The burger was sent back and replaced. The steak was eaten around the most rare parts and the chicken and succotash was left mostly untouched. We were starving,so we ordered a poozooki sampler to share and a decaf coffee. Glad they couldn't screw up ice cream and cookies. My friend prepped her coffee and began drinking it till she saw a coffee ring in the bottom of her cup. Since it was a new cup of coffee, this was utterly disturbing. We called over a server and all they said they'd do is replace it. Gross. You poured and served a ""fresh"" cup of coffee in a dirty cup. When the waiter brought the check, I told him I had no problem paying for the beer, poozooki and pasta dish since those didn't have issues. All they removed from the check was the coffee. Awful.

Their steaks, pizzas and appetizers never disappoint.  After reading some of the one star reviews, I think they are being reviewed on their super busy days.

I raved to my wife about how good this place was since she's never been. So i took her for valentines day and got the worst service and food was just ok. I understand its valentines but still need to try and be intentive. So i went back this year giving it a second Chance. Let me tell you it only got worse. They were not busy at all. We sat down waited 30 min no waiter or waitress ever came by to say hi. I asked a bus boy if he could find our server he said yes left came back and said they are coming. It took another 30 min and still no serve. Then the manager passed by i flagged him down and told him what was going on and he apologized and took our drink order. Our server finally comes over and says sorry there was a shift change. We said fine we ordered our food and appetizer we get the appetizer but no plate or silverware. We wait 15 more min now our food comes. I'm missing my bake potato. I let the person know who brought our food since it wasn't our server. She said let me check on that. My server then comes i tell her that i am missing my bake potato. She says let me get that. I NEVER seen her again. Another server comes to our table says she's our new server for the remainder of the night. I tell her i am still missing my bake potato. She apologies and says let me go get that. Just like that NEVER seen her again. I had to get the manager and tell him about my situation and ask for the bill. He's reply i guess you had a bad experience from beginning to end and apologized and took care of our meal. Which was nice but i rather pay and get treated like i matter. Mind you all of this happened on a unbusy night. I mean more then half the building was empty.

It's like a 30-minute drive for us, so we only come up when there's good reason to. And - let's be honest here - the food is just not very good and is more expensive than most similar places in the area. I mean, you're in Salinas: if you want good food, you have at least 20 great Mexican restaurants to choose from and a ton of other good independent places. But, when we do come, the service has been really good. The servers are professional, know the menu really well, and know a lot about the beers. This is in stark contrast to the two BJ's I've been to in Tucson - my only other interaction with the chain - where the servers could only just paraphrase the descriptions written on the menu. It's a nice place too. Clean, comfortable, not too noisy but not too quiet, lots of TVs, etc. It certainly seems to be a popular happy hour spot, but there also aren't many happy hour options in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=80,3.04,2.6,2.504,2.7359999999999998,2.7760000000000002

The lady next to us sat 10 minutes after us, and ordered a steak and received her food before us.  I don't blame the servers cause they are the front end, but seriously annoyed.  The manager took care of it, but this is like the 3rd time a manager took care of it, but it's just disappointing, and the server didn't even ask if we wanted the pizzokie.  No wonder BJs needs to give free stuff or 20% off things or give movie tickets because how in the hell are they gonna get people to go in.  I should have just went to 5 guys next door and had a milkshake.

Last night my wife and I came to this BJ's for dinner, it's been one of our favorite places to go since we lived in Texas. We've always loved the atmosphere and the great food selection, paired with great service.  I can't say that those things lined up for us last night. Our waitress seemed a little frazzled, and maybe had too many tables on her plate. It took a good 10min before we even got a drink order in. Re fills came few far and in between.  When we finally got our food, it was ok. I was really too hungry to be picky at that point, but my wife's pasta was under cooked and not very good. I ordered the jambalaya, which is my favorite dish at every BJ's. My food wasn't bad at all. I think the only issue I had with mine is I think it was a little over seasoned. We needed with a salted caramel pizzokie. That wasn't too bad.  Again, BJ's is usually our favorite place to go, from Texas to Washington state it's been amazing. I'm just not a fan of the customer service at this location.

I could write a book about the problems we had with this visit. After ordering the appetizer we had to wait almost 20 minutes just to get some chips and dip. Then when our drinks were empty the waitress said she would be right back with some more, we didn't see her again for another 20 minutes. All the empty tables around us were not cleared or cleaned almost the entire time we were there. My friend's order came out wrong and when we both asked the waitress for ranch she came out with 1 tiny cup of ranch and set it between us and took off before we could ask for more. Another issue I had was when I had asked for a water and the waitress poured it into my cup that had my lemonade in it and then she just walked off.The biggest issue though was that the wait staff was so inattentive and seemed to want to do anything else then check on their tables. What should have been an hour dinner turned into a 2.5 hour dinner spent mostly waiting for our waitress to come to the table. I know we were not the only ones with this issue tonight. We saw people having to bring their checks up to the register after sitting so long waiting for their waitress to come pick it up and another couple who had to wait 40 minutes for anyone to even come to their table at all since they sat down.

It's such a beautiful restraunt and if you had a more attentive wait staff, you would have so much more better reviews and a higher rating but this seems to be a consistent issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=220,2.72,2.54,2.5,2.5640000000000005,2.612

Didn't eat much of it but other times I've gone the food has always been good so I didn't think too much of it. So we decided to place our desert order, he informed us that he would be taking off for the night and naturally that another waitress would be taking over. No big deal, however, the first and LAST time we saw her is when she dropped off our desert without saying a word!  We finished waited for the check, about 15 minutes of waiting I decided to call a waitress walking by. I said ""excuse me"" she glanced at me and kept walking. I was a little irritated but I just thought maybe she didn't hear me. Again, a second waitress passed by I made sure to say it louder so she could hear me. She then looked at me, rolled her eyes, looked away, and kept walking. At this point we were there for 35min I asked my boyfriend to call over a young man cleaning the tables. We informed him that we had been waiting and that we just wanted the check. He said he would let the waitress attending the table know and took off. 15 more minutes went by and nothing. Finally I asked the same worker if he knew anything about the check, he apologized and went to tell the waitress yet again.

It was very painful he somewhat cleaned up his mess he left it very slippery, and the replacement pizza wasn't brought out until maybe an hour later after the server was reminded.

Wait time for a seat is usually pretty reasonable, but after that is where the problems usually ( more then five times) begin. The wait staff is always friendly so I think this is more of a management issue. My family usually order drinks and a couple appetizers, the drinks take about 15 minutes on a average @ that time we ask about the appetizer, and they assure me it is on the way. The next time the server stops by and we order still no appetizers. Our meal usually comes after about 45 minutes of waiting as well as our long lost appetizer & less one kids meal. ( yes have forgot multiple times). Summary: Yes I have been comped here many times not because I have asked, because they have been through MANY managers and the process has not changed or improvements have not  been made at all & for that I cannot blame the wait staff that fall's directly on the shoulders of the management.

I ordered a Totonka...that was good! However, that's pretty much where the ""good"" part of this story ends. I ordered a large half-great white/half-chicken Philly pizza (super excited!) while the lady ordered the blue (or is it bleu? Whatever) cheese burger with the thin fries. Not long after our seemingly nice-guy waiter took our order, he came back with some other dude to tell us that he was taking off and said other dude would be taking care of us. Ok. That's fine. Now let's skip ahead about 45 minutes. We haven't seen our food, let alone new server dude since the introduction. Finally, our OLD server comes to the table to say that he is sorry that the food is taking so long and asked if he could get us some soup or salad on the house to make up for it. Uuuggghhhh we're F-Word hungry for the main course but ok, we ask for a salad. He says ok no problem and says the manager should be by with our food in a moment. Within 10 minutes or so, some manager guy came by with our food, didn't say a word to us, and left...douche move. Anyway, also keep in mind we never saw the ""salad on the house."" Whatever, it's been almost 50 minutes since we ordered so let's just eat...hopefully a pizza and a burger can make up for the crap service we were seeing tonight. NOPE!!! On my end, both the Great White AND the chicken Philly tasted EXACTLY the same...BLAND! And I'm pissed at this point because I used to go to a BJ's in Southern California ALL THE TIME FOR THEIR PIZZA AND IT WAS ALWAYS AMAZING! THIS BJ's has now screwed up the pizza EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! HOW?!?! FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESES CHRIST HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?!?! Ok, how about the burger, which last time was really good...NARP! Flavorless meat with bleu cheese that seemed to be WAY TOO pungent, and I'm not being a wimp here because I know how bleu cheese can be, but this was like old foot cheese. The fries were ok though...I guess. So we eat a little and hate everything and the new dude server comes over and says ""hey so I'm not sure what happened to the salad so...yeah."" To which we both stare at him in disbelief...BUT WAIT HE KEEPS GOING! ""Yeah you know how sometimes you have your good nights and you have your bad nights. Yeah, you know?""........the disbelief stare continued...""so anyway, the manager is going to discount some of your meal for you tonight."" That got an ""ok thank you"" out of me. Here comes the check...the manager took 4 dollars off of our nearly 60 dollar check...HAHAHAHAHAHA....AND get this! THEY HAD PUT THE SALAD THAT THEY FORGOT TO GIVE US ON THE BILL AND ONLY TOOK IT OFF BECAUSE IT NEVER CAME!!! Remember that whole ""on the house because we suck"" part??? Apparently they didn't.

But I do admit the wait staff did awesome Job, it just back end & management where the problems are happening ....now to top it off as we were leaving the waitress stoped by to apologize for what had happen with the delay in our order and then proceeds to hand us our bill AGAIN saying ""I noticed the manager only charged you for the one appetizer & ice tea but canceled the rest of your order that didn't come...so here's your bill"" by now I'm more than irritated because I had already paid the measly tab which was roughly $10 and we gave $20 directly to the manager and told him to give our waitress the change for her tip!

I had the spicy chicken soba noodles, my wife and daughter picked salads, my bro-in law and father in law had hamburgers that looked good. So what's the problem?  The service is bad enough not to go back. We showed up on Saturday morning at 11:30 and the place was empty. We had 8 in our party and asked to sit outside. They looked at each other like we asked for a red carpet entrance. They finally let us, but it took 15 minutes to move a table over! Then it took another 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. Then another 15 to get the drinks. We spent 2 hours there, it was ridiculous. At one point our waitress was talking with a family outside for about 10 minutes: laughing and having a good old time, while we all waited.

When our server arrived back at our table she explained that her food was taking longer because the smiley face fries weren't done cooking yet, and said it in a tone as if we should have already known that. Why on earth would you deliver the adult food before the kids?!!  Another 3 minutes passed before we received her food. I'm sorry, 8 minutes between delivery for a child's food (on their birthday no less), is 8.5 minutes too long. This whole time there wasn't a single apology. Once everyone finally had their food, we dug in to our now cold food. My hubby realized that his Brussels sprout salad was lacking Brussel sprouts! We waited another 4 minutes for our server to check back, and she fetched us the sprouts. By the time they were added to the salad he was already half done.

Well, tonight, I finally have to weigh in and write about how bad BJ's is. This is not my first time here, and all the previous visits have been less than stellar. But tonight, this takes the cake. We started by making a reservation for 9, as we were having a birthday celebration. We found out several hours later another guest could make it, so we called to add them to our party. We were told that they could put our name in, and we could wait. REALLY?!? My daughter wasn't feeling well, so she stayed home anyway. Little did we know that she would be the winner in this whole ordeal. We arrived and were seated immediately. Half the restaurant was empty. My wife and I shrugged our shoulders, realizing it would not have been a big deal at all to add someone else to our table (and it had room).  Our waitress was pleasant, but the service was slow.  Our food finally arrived and more than half the dishes were poor. My mother-in-law ordered a chicken club sandwich, which arrived with WAY undercooked and it was obvious the food had sat out too long, as the the underside of the sandwich was soggy. My father-in-law ordered the flat bread pizza, which too, was also left out too long, as the center was soggy and the outsides of the crust were stale.  My wife had a salad, with no dressing, and since our waitress was not around, was not able to send it back. Another person's order was wrong, and another had onions on their burger, which they specifically asked not to have. Again, tough to send back, when the service is not around. When time came to pay the bill, we asked to speak to the manager. He came out and listened and he did comp the poor plates, as well as give us $40 in gift cards, so I will commend the manager on making the effort, and give this review a 2 instead of a 1 star rating.  The kitchen, however, rates a ZERO on this effort.

13,Joey M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",109,54,12.0,1.0,2017-04-01,"We had the most AWFUL experience at the BJ's in Salinas yesterday (3/31) A group of my friends and I were celebrating and decided to have lunch here. We arrived at about 2:30pm and walked to the hostess and said we'd like a table for 4. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or in the dining room and we asked to be seated in the dining room. She said it would be about 15 minutes. We asked if she needed our name and she said no. We asked if we could get drinks at the bar and she said it would be fine and that she would grab us when our table was ready. Fast forward 15 minutes later, I walked back to the host table where a different hostess was waiting. I told her we checked in about 15 minutes ago and we were still at the bar waiting for our table. I told her the hostess before her did not get our names and she said that was fine and she'll come grab us.  Fast forward ANOTHER 15 minutes, my party moved back to the lobby and sat there waiting for our table to be ready. The hostess was just standing there and finally I asked again if the table was ready and she said ""Oh, we never got your names."" How long was she going to let us sit there in the lobby before saying anything to us? We were the only ones in the lobby? We checked in with her while we were at the bar so it makes no sense that she would have forgotten what we looked like? And like I said, how long was she gonna let us sit there before realizing we were still waiting? The dining room and the bar weren't even busy. Eventually, the hostess blamed the hostess before her and sat us. Then, our server, Joey, continued the bad customer service and was not attentive, not friendly, and definitely did not want to be at work. We waited for about 20 minutes before our orders were even taken. The manager needs to be aware of what is happening in their store. The customer service is so poor.

I should have realized from the interaction with the hostess, who was kind of rude, that this wasn't going to be a good experience. She asked if I wanted to sit at the bar because there was no wait.  I said no thank you I would like a booth. She seemed very put out by my asking for a booth and again stated that there was no waiting at the bar... I said we would wait for a booth and she said (in an irritated tone) it would be a 20 minute wait. She then proceeded to seat us less than 5 minutes later(btw the booths stayed half empty for our entire meal) Our server (I forgot his name) was okay....however when our dinner came out my potato was cold and hard. I asked for another one and some steak sauce. My husband eventually had to go get some for me as my steak was getting cold. The steak was so salty that my son ( who loves steak) barely touched it.

24,S S.,"Monterey, CA",0,13,3.0,1.0,2017-04-24,"Such a great blue atmosphere outside, until you walk through that giant revolving door. That's when things become a circus. We called ahead on Sunday afternoon(about 40 minutes ahead of arrival time) We tell the hostess on duty that we called ahead and our name is (Blaah Blaah) She said it would be about 10 to 15 minutes. Now we are a group of 5, two young children, and three adults. Twenty five minutes and we are still waiting(standing) no room to sit in the lobby area. I could swear I saw a monkey juggling menus on the take out kiosk , but it was just me hallucinating from a lack of food.   I approach the desk again and ask if there is a problem with seating us. The hostess says you are a group of 5 , 2 to 4 people are easier than 5 and up. Ok fair enough, about ten minutes later we get seated.  This is when the fun starts. We sit for about 15 more minutes and finally get our drink orders taken. Ten minutes pass, water comes, ten minutes later the rest of the drinks arrive.  We finally order in about another 25 minutes.  Seems at this point that we should have just said we want the check and go over to Red Lobster, but we were begging for more circus acts. Act two(or three, lost count) takes place when one of two appetizers arrives. Why is there only one? where the heck did the other one go? Again the picture of that juggling monkey popped into my head eating our stuffed mushrooms.  So when four people order we should have four plates arrive at once, right? wrong again, one plate gets out first, then another , then another, with gaps of time between them. I'm not making this up, it's just unreal.(like the monkey) The food was not prepared correctly , I should have been back there cooking. Better yet my three year old daughter could whip something up. It really couldn't get worse, but then again this is BJ's sooo... in one of the dishes there was a long piece of twine(string) on the pizza. We told the waitress about it, showed her, and well the management never arrived to smooth things over, nothing.  As we left the establishment the Monkey offered me his left over banana peel.

After showing him my receipt he poorly explained he needed to email to be forwarded. This long winded explanation basically caused my food to be cold. His attitude was rude and unfriendly, he wasn't sincere in his apologies at all and the person he was supposed to be managing was more apologetic.

This including getting seated at a sticky table, a waitress that didn't once smile genuinely, with a Hot Topic doom-and-gloom make up ensemble. She offered my mother ""Pepsi products"" as an alternative to Coca Cola. After a half hour wait for our food, my mom asked her to wipe down our table. She replied, ""Just this side?"" The entire table is the usual, or to what I am accustomed.  Our server placed our food on the farthest side of our table and left us to retrieve with a rag to wipe down our table. We sat there with our food on our table out of our reach for longer than five minutes. After only wiping in front of me and a really forced ""Sssorry about that, guys!"" my mom found the rag to be bone dry when she herself took it and applied actual elbow grease into wiping the table down in front of me, herself and my brother with the waitress standing there watching how it's supposed to be done. After pushing the stickiness around, the waitress plopped our food in front of us, and left. No offer of anything like bbq sauce, or if we needed anything else.  There were only five tables in our section and I watched every other table get checked up to three times for drink refills, etc. This included the table right across from us that our waitress checked on at least twice while just passing us right on by. When she finally did come over, I asked her for a take out box. After the sticky table and watching my mom palm a dry, mystery rag over our table herself, I had a lot of food left over from loss of appetite. I asked another server for the manager when our server gave me the smallest take out box possible for the large entree I couldn't finish because of the lack of cleanliness.  Thank you Michael, for making it right. The food was fantastic, the way you patiently listened to our plight was greatly appreciated. Thank you for letting us ask for you on our next visit. Maybe the waitress was having a hard day. But whatever the case, today was a celebraton of the first Father's Day our family endured after my father's passing and she ruined the staple event of the day because of, as we concluded, lack of training.

The service was the biggest disappointment this time.   First, the server brought the wrong drinks to the table and passed them all out before realizing she had the wrong table. Then, we got our drinks, but the lemon drop came with salt on the rim instead of sugar. Yuck!  The server took it back and had the bar make a new one. It was good the second time out.   Then that server took a break and we got a new server.  I'm guessing he is still learning because he never asked us if we wanted refills or more to drink and never cleared any of our empty glasses.  We also got our check before our dessert came.  Weird.  Dessert finally came and it was delicious.

20,Dominic A.,"Salinas, CA",0,9,4.0,1.0,2017-09-07,This place has been a blunder since day one...I mean looks like corporate tries to keep the menu looking good but the staff does not perform what BJs is trying to do at least at this Salinas location ... Management at this location needs to hire people who care....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=20,2.32,2.58,2.612,,2.476
16,Trisha D.,"Salinas, CA",11,16,1.0,4.0,2017-09-09,This place is my favorite place to eat in salinas. The only compliant i have is with managment. I asked a question to a manager name Filiberto i expected he knew everything about the food instead he was very sarcastic and didn't even speak english well. Maybe bjs should pay for English classes and courses in customer service this guy obviously dont know his job well. Other then that the food is always great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.28,2.6,2.624,,2.472
3,Sal B.,"Monterey, CA",82,29,69.0,2.0,2017-09-17,I live in Monterey. Ive heard Good things About BJs. I went My First time a Few Months ago I saw the Combo With Potato Soup or Salad. So I tried The Clam Chowder That was Good Tasted fresh. then The Potato with Bacon and Cheese. there was Very little Cheese and Bacon. After That was Gone all I ate was the potato. For $8 I was expecting a Loaded Potato More Cheese and Bacon Not 3 oz on it. On 9/17/17 I went back to Try something Else. I had the Root Beer Glazed Ribs. They were Great !! Then the Potato Skins. They Were Great A lot of Cheese and Bacon. I returned on 9/18/17. Had the Potato Skins again. Then Half Rack of Ribs with Mashed Potatoes and Ginger Creamed Corn. THE RIBS did Not Come with Their Peppered BBQ sauce ???It Was DRY and Chewy.   I could Not Eat the Corn. Too much Spices and over powering with Ginger could not taste the Corn.  Otherwise  ill Try something else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.32,2.57,2.628,,2.4699999999999998

28,Michael M.,"Waimanalo, HI",0,5,,1.0,2017-10-27,"Wow. What a TERRIBLE experience. We love BJs and come here often but today was the absolute worst time here and honestly one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We arrived around 2PM. Our server, Tammy, spent about 10 minutes walking around doing other things before even acknowledging our presence. When she finally did, she came across as curt and hurried, like we were a bother and interruption to her day. Regardless, we put in our order for an appetizer and food, with the intent to get dessert after as well. After bringing it out we asked for a side of ranch to eat our wings with. We watched out server walk around, cleaning tables chatting with the manager (who also needs a refresher in customer service because he is terrible as well) and doing completely irrelevant tasks while our table and the ONE other table this server had sat neglected. We say without drink refills for this entire time as well. After we asked AGAIN for the ranch she finally brought it and our wings were freezing. It had been over 15 minutes. HORRIBLE lunch service. She was much more concerned with cleaning tables than she was serving the ones she was assigned to. And the manger. What a joke. He did nothing but walked around cleaning tables and chit chatting with the same table over and over. We made eye contact multiple times and our entire table looked PISSED and he did nothing. Not difficult to see why the wait staff is terrible when they have an equally terrible lead of service. We ended up not getting dessert because we knew it would take forever and at this point we were so upset. There are so many negative reviews regarding lunch time. You would think the owners would step in and make some change. Guess they are fine with losing business and loyal customers. Save your time and money. Eat elsewhere. Chipotle will cost half the money and at least they'll serve it with a smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas?start=20,2.48,2.55,2.644,,2.5220000000000002
2,Nicole L.,"Salinas, CA",0,60,23.0,3.0,2017-10-27,"I like coming here on Tuesdays for the $3 pizookies. We usually order one of every flavor and just enjoy a little bit of each.  I do not care for the lighting during dinner time. It is way too dark. I can barely see the menu, and there have been times my grandfather actually had to pull out a flashlight to read the menu.  The service is really a hit or miss. I have had excellent service and also really horrible service. It just depends on the day.  As for the food, it is pretty consistent. I like the soups and salads. Everything is always hot and fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.56,2.55,2.636,,2.5540000000000003
6,Cyrina Y.,"Salinas, CA",73,26,18.0,2.0,2017-11-09,"Hate to say it, but the Salinas BJ's sucks. I've been here a handful of times (always by the suggestion of the person I go with), and each time the service is really bad. It takes a really long time for us to be served our food; the food isn't hot when we do get it; and we don't get checked on by the waiter/waitress. The menu is great with lots of options, but because of poor service, I'd opt for going to a different BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.52,2.56,2.64,,2.544
18,J L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-25,"I do not know if it has improved any since a year or so ago, but my goodness... the worst customer service I had seen in my life. Eons would go by and the wait staff was missing in action. During my last experience, during the first hour we got a table and got drinks started. We waited a good while for someone to take our order, but that came in the second hour. I also remember watching a family get their order. They were pissed. Not only was the order incorrect/not to their specifications, they had waited as long as we had for something to happen. Honestly, at that point, I vowed I was not going to go back. Spend your money and time somewhere better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.4,2.55,2.632,,2.49
1,Timothy N.,"San Jose, CA",108,63,48.0,2.0,2017-11-28,"Pizookies!!! Literally the only reason to ever come here. Especially for $3 The plaza it is in gets way too much attention not to mention sharing an already small parking lot with numerous other food joints. Besides parking, if you come here on a weekend, expect it to be crowded. And what does crowdiness bring? Slow service. Besides having to wait an hour when they told and texted us '20 minutes'. The service was horrendous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big restauraunt and each waiter is probably juggling several tables. I understand that, but when customers are literally sitting there with food done and pretty much eye-ing the waiters to find their waiter for the bill, a water refill, or dessert then there is an issue. It wasn't even just a couple of tables as I even witnessed numerous tables raise their hand to flag the waiter.  Hmm this next point I think is more of my fault but I think the waiter could have actually asked to make sure. Previously I had the triple chocolate pizookie and it was the best thing ever. Basically imagine brownies and ice cream. Anyways, so I forgot the full name this time and the waiter already took 20 minutes after we finished eating to just bring our check(didn't even check on us or ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the check), when I ask if we could add a chocolate pizookie.  My error? There is 2 chocolate pizookies. One that is a chocolate chip called a chocolate chunk pizookie(?) w/ their vanilla ice cream. Now yes, it is my fault, but I think he could have spent an extra 15 seconds asking me which one instead of just ordering the first one he remembered because they both have chocolate in their name. Didn't dock stars for this but figured it was part of the 'service' that they can provide.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.44,2.52,2.636,,2.488

4,Ben R.,"Salinas, CA",77,4,,1.0,2017-12-30,"The customer service here is fucking terrible. The wait times at the tables are way too long no matter how packed or empty it is. The front desk usually only has a bland look and ask basic ""table for two?"" With no actual greeting. The most annoying part is that the server never comes to check on you. The 4/5 times I went they took my order, brought my food, then check. No asking of we are alright or needed refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.44,2.49,2.624,,2.47
0,Paul S.,"Elkhorn, CA",5,8,,5.0,2017-12-31,"Eat here at least once a month, sometimes 2 or 3 times a month, maybe 30 or 40 visits so far.  With few exceptions, food has been just perfect.  Staff has always tried to bend over backwards, extremely accommodating, knows the food they serve really well, very generous when things aren't perfect.  The chief cook has even come out on occasion to talk to customers.  Big restaurant, nice atmosphere though can get noisy, some very nice large tables and WiFi.   As for those bad experiences, they were not nearly significant to turn me away from coming back, as many other restaurants have (on the first visit), largely due to a busy day and waiter who probably was new.  The only incident involving food was receiving a salad that was warm and soggy and did not seemed like it came off someone else's table.  Ummmm... Oh, the bizookie deserts are to die for.  Literal joyous death by bizookie.  S'mores bizookie is amazing, but maybe a bit too much for one person.  Good item to share with 2 or 3.  They also have salted caramel bizookie if you're into that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-salinas,2.52,2.49,2.624,,2.5020000000000002
