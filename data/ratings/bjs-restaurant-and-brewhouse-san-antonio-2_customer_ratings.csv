139,Roberto L.,"San Antonio, TX",16,65,28.0,2.0,2012-03-13,"We went here to eat as a family. It was actually one of the first places we ate out when moving to San Antonio, so I was excited with it being a ""brewhouse"" and all! This review is weighted on the name having ""brewhouse"" in it, so while the food was OK, the other factors pull it down. Food (3 Stars) ------------------- I got a burger, can't really mess those up. In order to ensure that, I ordered an open face burger. It was pretty good. My wife ordered off the specials list and she was happy with her meal as well! I would give the burger and fries and meal an overall 3. Beer (2 Stars) -------------------- I ordered the American Ale. I don't know if the fault is on me, the restaurant or the server. The real answer might be ""yes"". When I read the description on the menu, I was expecting a nice darker ""Budweiser American Ale"" style beer to come out. When the light colored beer came out, I looked at my wife and said ""uh-oh"". It was an IPA, there is no other way to describe it. The menu should have read ""American Ale: It's an IPA.""  Service (2 Stars) ----------------------- This is where things kind of pulled the experience down for me. I sipped the beer and then it sat there for the rest of the meal (I hate IPAs). The waitress finally asked about the beer and I told her I thought it was more of an IPA and that the menu didn't really describe it right. She said ""yeah. that's true, I mean it is more like an IPA"". She then walked away.  Overall, we have eaten around this place a few times, but never gone back. I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it hard, but it made it really hard. I have experienced better and would rather try different places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140,3.76,3.76,3.76,2.7920000000000007,3.76
131,Charles B.,"Houston, TX",7,53,17.0,2.0,2012-04-10,"Hey BJ's, serving 4 out of 5 people passable food won't get you four out of five stars.  1.5 stars for you, but I'll round to 2. Our family and a friend had dinner at BJ's.  A medium pizza for two, a burger, a bread bowl soup, and pasta.  The first four were OK, but my daughter's pasta was unbelievably bad.  The flat fettuccine noodles were stuck together, sometimes as many as four thick.  It appears somebody dumped them in the pot to boil and never stirred. The waitress was very apologetic and got the manager.  He offered to remake the food, but said it would be awhile to make the pasta.  By the time he came over, the rest of us were almost through.  We explained we were trying to catch a movie and didn't have that kind of time to wait.  Rather than offering us something else, he simply said he would take the item off and left.  He was not very apologetic and not even too disturbed that half the pasta was stuck together and hard. (And, no, it wasn't possible to find the half good pasta among the hard and stuck together pieces.)  My daughter shared the remaining portions of the other entrees.  Yes, he took the item off, but he ruined everybody's experience. The thick crust pizza was very doughy also and sub-par.  Kennedy's Chicago Pizza a couple of miles away is way better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.8240000000000003,3.6400000000000006

The place is impeccably clean and beautiful. The staff is very well trained, super friendly, and seem to genuinely enjoy being there. They have such a huge selection of delicious food that they have page numbers on their menu. And i think it runs into the teens lol. They have an amazing happy hour with half price apps and mini pizza. I'm not a big pizza fan, but I'm a big fan of these. There is even an option for wheat crust or flatbread. They have a reverse happy hour too for a late night snack. Nice place to take your family, have a girls happy hour, or to chill and watch a game. Mike the GM really impressed me today when our waiter made a teeny tiny mistake that was no problem but still came to our table and offered to make everything right.

165,Angela E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,21,4.0,2.0,2012-07-23,"Bad experience tonight. (Alamo Ranch location )  Today is my stepdaughters 13th bday, she chose BJ's to have dinner at (on a Monday night.)  So I call around 2pm, to ask if we can make reservations for 6pm for a party of 11.  I was told by Mercedes that, no, I shouldve called 24 hours in advance and they wont take my reservation.  I asked really, you cant take the reservation now for a Monday evening? and she replies - nope.  I then told her, I guess I should just go to another restaurant, to which she replies, ok, thank you , goodbye.  RUDE.  I normally would have just gone to another place, however my stepdaughter really wanted to eat here.  So with that said, I called back and spoke to a manager - Mike, who apologized for the previous girls behavior and said they would love to have us if we are still willing to come.  So our reservation was made. 6pm comes,.. our party of 11 is seated.  Our waitress is Breanna.  In taking our orders, Breanna is a tad bit condescending and rude and not very personable.  My father asks if both the wedge fries and skinny fries are seasonsed and she says - No, just the wedges, in a tone which reeks of speaking to a 5 year old.  Then my 4 yr old son order burgers & applesauce, hes the only one who didnt get his meal when the entire rest of the table got theirs.  I asked her where his food was, she stated she would check on it and let me know.  She then proceeds to take another tables order, log it in the system (5 minutes has passed) and then I had to go up to her to ask her again.  Again, she states she will check on it and let me know.  She then comes back (everyone else is 3/4 of the way done with their meal, and my husband is feeding our son his burger) and says the kitchen dropped it on the floor on  the way out and they are having to recook them.  Which I think is a load of crap.  I think they forgot the order to begin with and were trying to buy time. Needless to say, we should have chosen another place for her birthday.  Poor service from start to finish.  Waste of our money for the food and service we got.   Eat somewhere else, you'll be happier you did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.6320000000000006,3.5200000000000005

Being a chain (and I'm not really a fan of chains) I find that the food and drink here is dependable. It's obvious that other people have had bad experiences. These things happen, but everyone is due for an off-day once in a while. I'm just a little more easy going when it comes to restaurants and that's why I enjoy it here; I don't have high expectations. We came here yesterday for a beer and a snack. We ordered a couple pints (their Oktoberfest and Hopstorm IPA) and shared a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was awesome! Granted the pizza wasn't mind-blowing but it's a chain restaurant/brewpub, what do people expect? I'm not going to sing to heavens about how great BJ's is, but if you want a nice cold pint, good bar food, and watch the game (and if BW3 is packed) then this is your place.

135,Heather J.,"San Antonio, TX",15,87,16.0,4.0,2012-11-09,"My husband and I had gone to BJ's by ourselves for lunch and dinner, all of which we enjoyed.  The portions are a respectable size and they have a wide range of options.  I don't tend to like huge menus, but a large part of theirs is due to pizza and burger options.   Our most recent experience was actually when we held a surprise party for my Grandmother's 80th birthday.  We had a dozen family members coming from all over and needed a place to surprise her.  Unfortunately, most places with private rooms charge way more than we had in our budget and require larger groups.   While the Alamo Ranch BJ's doesn't have a private room, they do have a back section that is partially partitioned and they could take our group of 12 people.  You just call ahead and ask to make a group reservation, with the only fee being the automatic 15% or so (it might be 17-8%, I can't remember sadly) gratuity added onto your bill.  Then all you have to do is show up at the time you reserved and everyone can order off of the regular menu - they even will let you split the check! Another benefit was that we were allowed to bring our own cake and ice cream, which our waiter brought out when we asked at the end of the meal.  Service was only slightly slower than when we had come as a couple, but this is not unexpected since a larger party simply takes longer to deal with.  All in all it was a wonderful meal and worked well for our family since we were only a mid sized group and preferred to split the check among ourselves.   If you need a casual place to take a larger group or just want to go for an individual meal, I would definitely recommend BJ's Brewhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8960000000000004,3.4800000000000004

The staff is very friendly and eager to recommend items from the menu, to include the vast variety of beers. My husband and I went for an early dinner a few days ago and ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It was so big, we took half of it home. It really is enough to feed four people. It includes Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was probably the best version that I have ever had. It was so good that it will probably be our default appetizer from now on. My husband really liked the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well. The Avocado Egg Rolls are good and the dipping sauce is great but we had to add salt because they were very bland. We ordered the BJ's Favorite Pizza the first time we went and it was very very good. We had the BJ's Classic Combo this time and we did not enjoy it as much as we did the first one. I had a Caesar Salad on our first visit and it was very good as well.

Wide range on their menu, never had anything we didn't like. Adding on, chose to do an 'edit' vs. an 'update'. I'm keeping them at 4 stars.  Mini pizzas are perfect if you have a group & want to try a few different ones. During happy hour they are $6 and there's no limit on how many you can order. Appetizers are large portions and are also half off during HH.   Sometimes beer can be out due to them being seasonal or made in-house however there are plenty of choices if you need a back up.

I've only ever sat at the bar or a table in that area (easier access to drink refills... ya know?), therefore I cannot speak for the service elsewhere. The food is consistent, and it's on the top of my ""chain restaurants that I'll eat at"" list. Their beer is also quite good, the IPA, blonde, and lightswitch lager are all pretty good beers. They have a decent variety on tap as well if you're not feeling like trying theirs. Magic Hat #9 is always my go-to. Mixed drinks are not too shabby, but I rarely dabble in those. I like their small plates ($2.95-$4.95) because they're not too much before your meal, but the apps are tasty, too...Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and avocado rolls are my favs. I get the pizza most often. I used to love their buffalo chicken pizza, thin crust or deep dish. This is the only place I've seen celery put on the pizza, and it's the perfect touch. New menu items recently, really enjoyed their brussel sprouts/kale salad with berries. Also, clam chowder is very good for being at a chain and nowhere near New England.

Hubby and I ordered the deep dish bacon ranch pizza with no onion and the berry cobbler for dessert. The 14'' pizza is a good size and thickness, more than enough for two people to share. The crust taste very similar to a pan Pizza Hut crust but less greasy. I am from the south not Southwest and we love cobbler. I have to say I was impressed by theirs!

My favorites are the Atlantic salmon with rice pilaf and steamed veggies, the California Club sandwich, the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread, the Mediterranean tacos, and the traditional wings appetizer. My parents are big fans of their Piranha Pale Ale Chili and the gluten free thin crust pizza, and my boyfriend likes their New Orleans Jambalaya and the Crispy Jalapeno burger. The food is pretty consistent and each time that I have had a problem the manager has fixed it right away. The first time was for a to-go order - I had ordered a ribeye steak and when we brought it home it was heavily seasoned and tasted of pure salt. The manager offered to make a new one, refund us our money or leave us a gift card for what we spent. I opted to have a new one and the replacement steak was perfect. The second time was on a visit this past weekend. I wanted to try something new so I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. As soon as I picked one up I noticed that it was cold, so I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be served that way (kind of like sushi or ceviche) but she said it wasn't and took it back right away. The manager stopped by our table and offered me a soup or salad while I waited for new tacos. I tried the wedge salad (excellent!) and then the shrimp tacos that came out were amazing!! The flavors were great and the shrimp were nice and warm. I would definitely order that again. Also, if you sign up for their free rewards program you collect points for every dollar you spend. Since my family eats here quite a bit, it's nice to be rewarded for our loyalty.

But everything else under par.  We got there just before 5:30 PM on a Saturday night.  I gave the hostess my reward card number and waited for our party of 5 to be seated. Another party of 5 came in about 5 minutes after us. They requested a booth and 2 kid menus, I requested a table.  Somehow, our tickets got switched; they were seated before us as were about 5 other parties that arrived after us.  We were finally escorted to a booth, the host had 2 kid menus in hand. I informed the host that our tables had been switched and the other party was sitting at the table I reauested.  By this time, the resturant was packed so the manager at us at the bar, he pushed 3 small high tables to accomadate our party. Other than the 20 minute delay to finally be seated, the seating was fine.  We ordered a couple of beer samplers, and began to look at the menus.  The waitress accidently knocked over one of the small empty glasses and it shattered. Shards of glass went everywhere with majority of the broken glass landing in my friends lap. The server quickly cleaned up the area and apologized.  Accidents happen, and the waitress handled it like a pro.  When our food finally arrived, my daughter's dish was garnished with a wilted piece of lettuce that had began to turn to black.  My New Orleans Jambalaya was coated in cayenne pepper to the point that the dish was inedible.  You could smell the spice from 3 feet away. I sent the dish back and by the time the replacement dish arrived the rest of the party had already finished their meals. In the end the food was delicious and the server did a fine job, but overall the attention to detail was lacking. When I paid my bill I noticed that I was not credited with my reward points and I had to go back to the server to have them added.  This little error was a result of the other party being given my table in the beginning.  I noticed that tables seated around us had also sent dishes back.  It was a very crowded Saturday night and it seemed like the restaurant was simply understaffed.  Overall a good meal, just a bunch of little details that brought the experience down a couple of notches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.34,2.96

I've yet to experience one bad or disappointing beer/wine at BJ's, and on that note their drink selection is very large. Of equal size is their menu... an abundance to choose from... something for everyone's taste. And trust me when I say: NONE of their food offerings are weak!

The restaurant itself is exactly what one would expect at a casual chain brew pub.  The dining area is massive and the bar seemed even bigger.  Good thing they had ample parking to fit all of the patrons that can eat at this location.  This was a good thing because the place was packed during my most recent trip here. There were a few items labeled ""new"" on the menu and I went with the bacon guacamole deluxe burger ($11).  It was an extremely large amount of food for such a low price.  The bun was probably the best part of the burger as it was buttery and grilled so it had crispy edges.  The guacamole really overpowered the burger because there was more guacamole than any other ingredient.  I did like the jalapenos used to spice it up though.  Diners also get the option of thin cut fries or potato wedges with seasoning.  They both sounded good and the thin cut fries were good enough. The wait staff seemed really busy and managed to forget about our table a lot.  We ended up sitting after our meal for about 30 minutes when the bill was dropped off.  I understand they were busy, but I watched a lot of them not being able to multitask.  They would get distracted and walk right by a lot of the times. Overall, this place is a good casual option for a cheaper bite to eat.  I want to try the beer as it sounds very good but it was a little pricey.  I will definitely go back but this place won't be anything I get excited for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=40,3.4,3.34,3.34,2.8920000000000003,3.3640000000000003

46,Sarah B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,2016-02-11,"I have given BJ's chance after chance, and I won't be back.  I was recently there on Monday, February 1st with a party of 20 or so at 2:00 in the afternoon for a farewell luncheon for three of my husband's coworkers. We were some of the first there. I ordered a rootbeer and the ahi tuna salad at 2:05.  The root beer came out quickly enough, but it was pretty flat and had little carbonation. It was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure if that was normal. I had only one since I didn't want a refill.  A 2:45 I asked how much longer my salad would be. That's 40 full minutes after ordering an entree that's barely cooked - the tuna is barely seared - and the rest is lettuce. Seriously? On a slow Monday afternoon it takes longer than 40 minutes to get a salad out? When it finally came, I had to scarf it down since I needed to leave at 3:00. I got more than half way through it before I noticed that the avocado was left out. I couldn't find our waitress to say anything, so I ate it and left my husband there to pay the tab.  The service was slow. The food took much too long. And when it did come, it wasn't even made correctly. Time after time that I've been there, the food has sucked and the service has been mediocre.

We went there on a Sunday afternoon with no wait but I know from experience that any given Friday or Saturday night will have you waiting from an hour to an hour and a half.  I got the Sriracha queso and chips and my husband got the mozzarella sticks. Both were really good. Our margaritas were a bit sour but the food was so great we really didn't care . I do have a problem with the call ahead policy. Really, if a restaurant isn't going to take reservations then they shouldn't even bother. Basically if you call them and tell them you're coming and ask to put your name on the list when you show up you will be handed a pager and you are put at the end of line. It does absolutely nothing so don't try to call ahead just go. Here is my biggest gripe: THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE. And I say that because what you are getting is burgers, pizza, pasta ... We noticed that many of the appetizers were just as, if not more expensive than the main courses. And seriously $9 for a 12 oz margarita? It wasn't even top shelf and tasted like sour mix. I could go across the street and get a huge fishbowl margarita with a beer in it for the same price.  I probably won't be eating here anytime soon except for a special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=80,3.24,3.25,3.25,3.0840000000000005,3.246

25,Megan Z.,"San Antonio, TX",49,9,5.0,2.0,2016-08-04,"My fiancé and I went there last night for dinner. The wait time for our food to come out was about an hour. We ordered the seafood and chicken tacos. The waitress, Sydney, was nice enough. She apologized about 5 times for the wait.. Meanwhile, the people (also a table of 2) who were sat after us ordered, received their food and left the restaurant before our order even came out. The waitress's excuse was ""I put your order in, we have had so many complaints from everyone tonight!""... Bravo, great response. This was my first time at this location and  needless to say (I feel the need to say it anyway) it wasn't a very pleasant experience. I didn't see a manager walking around to greet tables or handle the ""so many complaints"" as I was told. To top it off, I tried using their nifty app to pay my 50 dollar tab, it was advertised that you get 20% off for using the mobile pay option.. It didn't apply the discount so we had to wait even longer for the ""manager"" to approve the discount.. When we were finally able to leave, the waitress kindly handed me a coupon for a free desert (with purchase of entrée of course) which was expired.. Thanks a lot! We don't go out very often so it's very disappointing to have a such bad experience. On another note, the food was great (hence why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). Just wish the manager and staff knew a little something about customer service.. Rant over, hope no one else has the same experience.  I would also like to note, I recognize that $50.00 isn't a lot of money, I would hope that this isn't the reason we were put on the back burner. I have previously worked in the restaurant business (though it was years ago) and I understand that things happen, a lot. We did not throw a fit of any sort.

Even though it is a bit expensive we would go here about once a month. In the past several visits we have been noting a decline in the food quality. Service is good, but the food is just not worth the cost. We ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was ALL tentacles and clumped together and much too chewy. Next came the chicken tortilla soup...with NO chicken. I sent it back and when the bowl was returned they had simply thrown in a few pieces of grilled chicken. Then they brought the bowl back to me and no big surprise the soup was now cold. Now finally the Flatbread arrives. The flavor was okay but the crust was soggy. We have decided that a cookie desert is not worth it. We won't be going there again anytime soon.

62,Sarah J.,"San Antonio, TX",96,247,213.0,2.0,2017-01-02,"5 years ago, I loved BJ's. It was a frequent hangout spot for brews (Love that they have Hoegaarden on tap, and a similar citrus wheat bear of their own!) and flatbread pizza or apps with friends, and I almost always sat at the high top bar tables. My husband and I even went on our first date at BJ's back then.  Unfortunately, as the restaurant has settled into its prime, frequently busy Alamo Ranch location, everything has gone down hill. Not just the service, not just the food...everything. It's awful to watch a fun spot decline like this!! We've known this for awhile, but a few days ago one of our couple friends wanted to have dinner-date night there, so we gave it another shot. I got excited when we walked in because the hostess was extremely friendly. As soon as we sat down, the tone changed. We asked for a table for 5 and a high chair when we were seated, and the table they gave us was a booth. When we reminded our waitress about the high chair, she said she wasn't allowed to put it at that table. Fine; understandable. However, the 5th adult in our party wasn't there yet and we let him know not to come because there wasn't enough room at the table. The rest of the restaurant looked to busy to move spots. One meal down for the waitress (and her tip.)  We ordered and there was a whole issue amongst our party over the beers offered. My husband just wanted a Bud Light or Budweiser, but none on tap. He ordered one of their supposedly similar house brews to try it, but it tasted terrible (and nothing like Budweiser so I don't know why the waitress pointed it out.) Okay. The couple we were with went back and forth with the waitress about the correct way a Black & Tan vs. a Snakebite should be made. Now they may have been wrong - I'm no beer officianado - but the waitress arguing with them was really not acceptable either. A few beers down for the waitress (so of course a lower bill to follow.) Food was an issue in itself that the manager actually did attempt to handle, and did a decent job. The kitchen brought out our meals but they had burned my husband's Root Beer Ribs, so the FoH Manager came to apologize and promised they would be out soon. Soon wasn't exactly the case though, they came out just under 20 minutes later after the rest of us had almost finished our food. However, the manager DID comp them from the bill. Another meal down for the waitress, though we made up for the $10 in tip because we don't like to take things for free; that's certainly not why I use Yelp. The small plate of fried asparagus was chewy and took strength to bite through. My avocado spring rolls were as delicious as I remember them. Drink refills were few and far between, but the waitress also looked very busy.  Overall, with the drink and food issues, and the waitress's terrible attitude and rudeness, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. The one thing keeping BJ's from getting a 1 star review from me is the manager's attempt to at least appease his customers, and his attentiveness to the floor when it was necessary. It seems like since he's providing so much help, the wait staff could try a little harder to work with him!!

My server nando suggested a loaded burger with bottomless fries and when I told him I liked dark beers he got me the tatonka stout which was perfect. Great beer and even better service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=20,4.0,3.54,3.54,,3.724
2,Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",315,372,371.0,5.0,2017-09-01,"I have become a regular to BJ's. BJ's brews their own beer and it is amazing. When I come to BJ's for a beer I only drink their personally brewed beers. They have some custom beer mixes that you can choose from as well. I usually get the Hopstorm mixed with the stout. This was my first visit to this location. It was also my first time using the BJ's app. The app is really cool. You can keep track of your rewards, place a call ahead reservation, pay your bill and more.  Our waitress was on top of things. Come to think of it I don't think I have ever had bad service at BJ's.  Keep an eye of for their specials. On this visit they had a half rack of ribs, 2 sides and a mini pazooki for 13 bucks. The half rack was enough for me. Once we were ready to leave all I had to do was use ApplePay on the BJ's app and our transaction was seamlessly complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2,4.0,3.54,3.54,,3.724

17,Tenecqua D.,"San Antonio, TX",4,9,24.0,2.0,2017-10-15,This visit has gotten off to a horrible start. Myself and my family was seated. 15 minutes went by without any acknowledgement from any of the waitstaff. I had to approach the hostess stand to get a waiter to even take our drink order. This is completely ridiculous. Hopefully the rest of our visit goes off without any further issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2,3.84,3.55,3.55,,3.666

1,Shawn W.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",122,470,2428.0,3.0,2017-10-22,"Good service, good selection, and a good amount of deals offered at BJs.  I lived near a BJs in Maryland and never went to it.  It was one of those.  Oh I have time to go and time ran out.  Luckily moving here there is a BJs not too far from me.  I am glad there is as on my few visits to this place it offers some pretty good food and adult libations.   I have gone here mainly at lunch time and service has always been quick and attentive during the higher volumes.  Checkout their daily brewhouse specials they have going on Monday through Thursday and score a deal.  Also I would suggest downloading the BJs app to your phone so you can earn credits to freebies and get your free birthday gift from them.  The bartenders are friendly and do a pretty good job on the mix drinks as I have sampled more than a few drinks.  I am usually not a beer drinker but they offer this one particular cider known as berry burst.  I am a cider guy and this is one of those ciders I wish they sold in stores.  A very tasty in house brew to enjoy. The food is on par with many other chains that fill this spot in serving this particular selection of food and the choices are much the same.  One big difference is that BJs offers pizza.  They offer what is referred to as deep dish pizzas but to me it is not truly a deep dish pizza that you might be thinking of if you are thinking of a Chicago deep dish pizza.  It is more of a thick pan pizza and the crust is very airy and light.  Good pizza but everyone seems to be finicky when it comes to pizza.  It is on the level of many nationwide pizza chains.  The appetizers I have tried are pretty good but like the pizza it is on the level of many other chains. Good spot to have some food.  I don't think it will let you down but for me it did not wow me in terms of the food.  Now the drinks I will say were something that will have me returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2,3.76,3.57,3.57,,3.646

72,Alberto C.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",173,1,,5.0,2017-11-13,This is a fantastic restaurant. Good clean atmosphere and great drink selection. What made my experience wasn't just the food but the service Derek was an outstanding server who went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. Never did he have us wondering where he was and made sure our drinks were always full. Easy going to talk to and wasn't one of those servers you try to get away from the table as soon as he dropped off the food. I live on the other side of town and would be personally driving to this location just to request him as our server again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=20,3.88,3.57,3.57,,3.694
66,Chris G.,"Kingston, NY",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-15,"Poor experience from the get go. Restaurant was nearly empty, yet we waited 20 minutes for a table of 6. Drink refills(paid, and of the alcohol kind) were not offered throughout service. Food came out intermittently and then a fish and chips entree was delivered nearly 10 minutes after every one else. Clearly something is slipping here as we have eaten here several times in the past, but quality and service are not where they need to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=20,3.72,3.54,3.54,,3.6120000000000005

7,Adrian Z.,"San Antonio, TX",0,14,2.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"So I'm back, because out of town guests chose this location. Place is still half ass. My guests ordered beer flights and one of them had a cracked glass. He asked for it to be replaced and they topped off the glass with beer and brought the same glass back. He brought it to her attention again, that time it was fixed. A sirloin was ordered at my table medium well. It came well done and charred on one side almost like it was forgotten. BJs charges quite a bit for their food. None of it should be anything less than ordered. I don't care for a redo  like last time or my money back.
