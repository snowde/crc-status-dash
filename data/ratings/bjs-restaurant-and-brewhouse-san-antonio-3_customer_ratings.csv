We ordered in advance to save some time and sometimes that can be a crap shoot. This was no crap shoot. Food arrived as soon as we did and it was hot and delicious. Everyone seemed pleased. Drinks were refilled in a timely fashion and we even had time for dessert which was also fantastical in itself.

67,John B.,"Martinez, CA",501,673,437.0,2.0,2012-01-20,"Stopped by BJ's on my recent visit to San Antonio. I was craving their avocado egg rolls that I had gotten on my last visit to a BJ's years ago, apparently during my non-vegan dark ages. I was saddened to discover that they were pre-made with cream cheese. Oh well, I had walked nearly a mile to get here so I may as well order something. The fried artichokes looked appetizing & were actually pretty good. They tasted a bit too eerily like chicken though.  The bartenders push you to purchase appetizers & entrees like a stripper pushing lap dances in one of those clubs that I have never been too... I ordered a few beers anyways since my walk had made me a bit thirsty. The ""grand crus"" that was suggested to me by the pushy bartender was my least fave as I'm more of a dark beer fan. The Tatonka Stout was much better. The super cute server almost made up for the overall lackluster experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=80,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001
123,Jack C.,"Boerne, TX",9,1,,2.0,2012-02-08,"Whats up with the service tonight at BJs?  Staff seemed very confused and disorganized!  Stopped in with a friend after a game of racquetball to get a beer & food; having been coming in on Wednesdays for a month. Sat in the bar area; waited 10 minutes before a server showed up.  He took our drink order; when he returned with the drinks, he informed us that another server would be taking our food order.  He returned 10 minutes later - frustrated - and took our food order.  Twenty minutes later, the young lady - who was supposed to take the food order - informed us that the kitchen had made a mistake and that she would get the correct order out to us shortly.  When we finally got our food, the burgers were good but, the fries were cold!  Then she disappeared, returned later, left the check, and disappeared again.  The young man returned, took my card and brought back the receipt.  Very disappointing overall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=140,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
118,Anthony S.,"Harrisburg, PA",176,300,154.0,3.0,2012-04-03,"I usually try and stay away from reviewing chain restaurants because I don't really see the point.  When you go to a chain restaurant, you know what you are getting.  You are going to get mediocre food that is relatively high in calories and just OK. I don't think there is any chain restaurant out there that I would give anything but 3 stars to.  This review though is meant to highlight some aspects of Bj's which makes it a little different and give them some recognition for the things outside the norm that they do well. Food: I have never had a good meal here.  I have eaten lunch here twice, and dinner here twice.  Each time, I completely under-satisfied by their meals.  I have had a burger that was drier than the desert and under-seasoned/ not seasoned at all, a bun that was seared better than the meat on the bun, and lettuce/tomato on a sandwich that was mealy and mushy.  I hate their entrees.  Their appetizers and desserts, on the other-hand, are very good.  I love their potato skins, their pizookies, and their other appetizer offerings. Simply put, f you want to go to BJ's, go and get a wide variety of their appetizers.  Even their flat bread pizzas are awesome.  This is a real go-to spot for us when we have the munchies, or we just want some good ole' junk food.  The real star of the show here though is the Root Beer. This may sound strange, and you may be thinking, ""Anthony, you are writing this review because of the damn root beer?""  To you I would respond, ""hell yea!""  This is the very best root beer I have EVER had.  It is unbelievable how good it is.  You need to get a frosty mug of it AND...AND it is free refills.  This root beer should not be 'free' anything.  I would pay money for a second mug of it--that is how good it is.   A little background on my history with root beer: I have been a root beer lover for years.  I have been to hundreds (yes, hundreds) of micro-breweries in the Finger Lakes, and across the U.S. that brew their own root beer--each with their own unique twist.  Up to this point, Saranac Root Beer was the clear winner--no argument.  Now, Bj's root beer is a clear winner at Number 1.  Amazing root beer, really. Food: 1 star for entrees + 2 stars for appetizers +1 star for root beer = 4 / 5 stars Service: As with any chain restaurant, this is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a server who just started employment and they don't secretly loathe every customer that they have--and sometimes you get that veteran server who genuinely hates everyone and pretends to be nice--until they run out of 'nice' and stop giving a damn (yes, speaking from experience). I have generally had more enjoyable experiences than unemployable experiences Service: 3 / 5 Atmosphere: This is another thing that the location at The Rim has going for it.  I think that atmosphere is really nice.  The furnishings are classy, the bathrooms are clean, the floor is clean, the servers seem clean, the bar is clean, and everything amount the restaurant makes me want to come back--even if their entrees suck.  That is a pretty darn good atmosphere.  The only thing that taints this sometimes, are bad servers. Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: When we order appetizers, we usually go during Happy Hour so that they are half price.  I sit back and throw-back a cold one (root beer that is), and eat some delicious munchies while enjoying the company of friends or family.  Would I pay full price for an entree ever again?  Hell no.  Would I pay full price for an appetizer?  Depends on the appetizer.  Would I pay full price for a pizookie (dessert)?  Hell yes!   Price 3 / 5  Final / Concluding thoughts:  Honestly, if their entrees were better, this place would be awesome!  Unfortunately though, they just aren't--they are actually bad.  But we take this place for what it is--an awesome hang-out spot that is clean and fun to get together with people and drink some root beer (and yes, their regular beer too!) and vacuum-up some good appetizers.  Then, you get to finish everything off with a really delicious, moist, gooey, and satisfying pizookie.  This restaurant serves a very specific purpose for us--hang out and bar food.  It is definitely not a place we go to have a good meal. One final note, it sucks to find parking on a weekend, a Friday night, or other 'rush' times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=100,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
112,Scott D.,"San Antonio, TX",14,9,9.0,2.0,2012-04-24,"I ordered the COBB Salad (take out).  While it was certainly large, at a price tag of nearly $14.00 I would have expected more than a box full of chopped lettuce.  The premium toppings (bacon, turkey, avocado, etc.) were practically non-existent - just mere scraps really.  They did put a decent amount of Feta cheese on the salad. Due to the way the salad was prepared, it had very little flavor.  You really had to dig for a crumb of bacon. Very disappointing since I have enjoyed their food on 2 previous occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=100,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

127,Armando Z.,"San Antonio, TX",21,9,,1.0,2012-07-30,"My email to BJs today:  My wife and I visited the location at The Rim today for lunch. As we wanted to enjoy the Olympics while we ate, we decided to sit at the bar. A young lady named Adrianne was behind the bar. She greeted us and took our drink order. When she returned a minute or so later with a club soda and Shirley Temple, she asked if we were ready to order. We asked to have a few minutes as my wife had not had the time to look at the menu. After 4-5 minutes, she returned and took our order. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad and my wife the Hawaiian Mahi. Over 25 minutes passed without her following up with us. Adrianne visited with a couple at the end of the bar and fiddled with her cell phone from time to time. I finally had to ask her to please check on our food; within 3-5 minutes our food finally appeared. It should be noted that there were no more than six people sitting at the bar while we there (including ourselves), so I was somewhat surprised at the level of service. I enjoyed my salad and my wife thought that the fish was ok.

It's a go-to spot for us when we have visitors that frequent places like Applebees or Outback, as it seems just a step-above those, but doesn't get into the realm of exploration that might scare these visitors a bit.   We love, love the Pizzookies (desserts) -try the peanut butter one- but noticed that the kids version is $2.25, while the Trio for the adults (consisting of three of the kids sized dishes) costs $9.50 for the exact same thing. Sooo, we'll be ordering the kids' version next time.  Their beer is good, and so is their home-made rootbeer. None of the food has been overly impressive, but it's never bad either.  We did have an issue with them accidentally putting the spicy marinara on a kids' spaghetti dish on our last visit.. we thought the girl was just trying to not eat, so no one believed her when she said it was spicy... :( After a difficult time getting her to eat it, one of the adults finally tasted it, and poor thing... it was really spicy! When we asked the waiter about it, he said the spicy and regular sauces look the exact same, so someone must have messed it up in the kitchen. Not a huge deal, but maybe a comp or a new spaghetti would have been nice... and a perhaps a sign in the kitchen clearly distinguishing the sauces...  All in all, it's an easy place to go with a wide variety of people because the menu is large and there is something for everyone.

Unfortunately enough, this particular location has done a poor job with its customer service, which makes me question why I even return here. The food is better than many other big name restaurants around, but the service and staff here is no bueno. Food-wise -- I'm a big fan of their cajun pasta (with blackened chicken), their pizzas (usually the 'mediterranean'), their flatbreads, a few of their appetizers, and of course, the pizookies are the most rockin'. Don't get me wrong; the food is definitely worth a try, or more. Service-wise -- No, no and no. I don't mean to take away from the servers that have been on point, because there are also those, but the few that have been unpleasant and irresponsible, I'm not a fan of. And what's worse is that they know they've been that way and choose to ignore it. Example below. There have been a few times where I've decided to order curbside takeout (before 9 p.m., you have the option to have one of them come out and bring your food to your car). I usually get the fettuccine alfredo, which ALWAYS comes with bread. Now, the last three times I've ordered this, there's always been an issue. The first time - they were ""out of bread,"" so my order didn't come with any bread, which I was fine with, since that's understandable. The second time, I strictly said that I wanted no meat with my order of the alfredo and the side order of the macaroni and cheese - not only did I not receive bread, but I also got the macaroni and cheese with bacon. I called back to see if I could get an exchange or a refund, but the girl who was helping me decided to put me on hold for around 20 minutes. I hung up, called back and my calls went unanswered. I decided to leave it and not waste my time. Then, the third time, I ordered the same alfredo, yet what I got was a handful of pasta jumbled up in sauce, and once again, no bread on the side. I know BJ's has great quantity when you usually order, especially seeing from my orders at other locations, but this one has continued to slack when it comes to their to-go orders. The worst part of all this is that I sent an e-mail to corporate to inform them of what was going on, with pictures and all, and about six weeks later, I still have yet to hear from them. As I said, the food is usually good and better than most chain places around, but I don't like coming here any longer, and haven't since the last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=100,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.6640000000000006,3.1600000000000006

Our waitress was incompetent at best, but it gets worse so we both ordered the burgers with bacon, grilled onions and cheese. My burger was missing the bacon and my sisters was missing the bacon and mushroom she ordered. So then she tells the waitress who had by then brought out her fries that were burnt and had no bacon on them. She told the waitress who after she messed up our orders the waitress then brought out her bacon and mushrooms / onions on the side. We asked to speak to a manager and she huffed as she stomped off. We eventually got to speak to management and normally I leave a tip bad service or not this is where it got incredibly distasteful we asked for the check. Of course the waitress brings it and we are sitting there discussing things and she's eyeballing us. My sister paid and we sat for a bit she didn't leave a tip, and the waitress came by and picked up the check sat down at the table where she was folding napkins or whatever opened the booklet thing and rolled her eyes and huffed again. I ended up tipping her on the way out despite her behavior. Very unprofessional. immature and bad customer service on her part.

132,Caitlin S.,"San Antonio, TX",15,22,1.0,4.0,2014-08-08,"I've only been here twice, and the first time was several years ago.  It was Friday night, so the mall was packed, as was the parking lot for the restaurant.  We actually had to go park at Red Robin because we couldn't find a spot.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but that was fine.  Our waitress was great-she was friendly, very attentive, and knowledgeable.  It was very busy inside the restaurant, not one free table the entire time we were there, and the food came out pretty quick considering the hustle and bustle!  She kept our drinks filled and was always checking on us as she walked by.  My mom and I got the 2 for $22 deal which includes your choice of two of their salads or soups, a medium pizza, and a pizooki.  We both got the wedge.  The blue cheese dressing was delicious, however, I think that it could have used some fresh cracked pepper.  We chose their signature pizza, which comes with green peppers, white onion, pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, black olives, and seasoned tomatoes.  The crust was PERFECT.  Crispy on the bottom, and slightly chewy in the middle.  The toppings were good, but there was almost no sauce to be found.  However, the crust and the toppings more than made up for that, and we were hungry, so we didn't even think of sending it back.  I had their Berry Burst Cider and wow was it tasty!  It was the perfect summer drink, light and refreshing, not a high alcohol content either.  It was like adult dessert in a glass...For our dessert, we chose the salted caramel pizooki.  The waitress had me at salted caramel, pretzels, and chocolate.  It was every bit of delicious that she described and more.  I took one bite and was in a blissful state.  The three of us shared it, and it was just the right amount.  I will definitely be going back for more pizza, berry burst cider, and salted caramel pizookis!  My dad had the jalapeno burger, which was my recommendation from the last time I ate there.  It was a HUGE burger, with a very generous portion of tasty, seasoned fries.  The bill took a little long getting there due to a computer error, but I have no major complaints, and definitely like their food.  Two thumbs up!  I do have one issue, though.  I used the ladies room and noticed a very strange series of art on the wall.  Pictures of flowers, and a shirtless, very muscular young guy holding tires and flexing his muscles.  What is all that about?  Not tasteful at all.  I felt violated having that guy on the wall of the bathroom.  I wonder what's in the men's bathroom?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=140,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.216,3.0000000000000004

Everyone gets to enjoy what they like. The calamari is always requested by the kids and I must say, they have some of the best. It's not chewy like some of the other calamari we have ordered, even while traveling to the beach. You'd expect seafood at the beach to be the best... But BJ's calamari is excellent. My wife typically orders the parmesan crusted chicken and likes it so much she sticks with it. I wander around a little from the burgers to the salads with an occasional sharing of a pizza with my teenager. Service is always solid and it's great to be able to call ahead.

31,Amber S.,"San Antonio, TX",14,125,49.0,4.0,2016-01-21,"The service here is hit and miss. Sometimes you get good service, sometimes it's mediocre, and other times it's it just plain horrid. On the off chance you do happen to get good service, don't expect a winning personality from any of the servers. They will be nice. They will smile (sort of) and they will probably get your order right. I am not sure why but a lot of places are like this now. Kind of robotic in a way. They also enjoy standing around talking to one another... A LOT. But if you are there with people you enjoy being around you don't need a server that does anything other than just his/her job.  The food is excellent. Pricey, but excellent. It probably doesn't matter what you order, it's going to be good. This is what the 4 stars are for. JUST EXCELLENT FOOD.  Now onto the drinks. TIP: Whatever you do, if you like beer, and they have a HUGE selection of beer.... DO NOT ASK YOUR SERVER TO RECOMMEND ANYTHING!! I am quite sure these guys do not drink beer, ever. And if they do they obviously don't have taste buds. If you feel the urge to try a new beer just close your eyes, point, and hope for the best. Your chances are probably just as good if not better. (I think they recommend all the stuff they don't normally sell just to get rid of it.) DEFINITELY DO order the Pink Cadillac or the mojitos, any flavor mojito. If you are looking to drink casually get a mojito. If you are looking to feel really good off of just 2 drinks, get the Pink Cadillac. You will not be disappointed at all. And they taste fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=40,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.3760000000000003,3.4400000000000004

And of course, no BJ's trip is complete without those amazing Pizookies, which at this point is even pointless to comment on because we all know they're heaven in a skillet. The best part though? On your birthday, the Pizookie is free! :D The service we received was exceptional.  We had a waitress named Katie who was phenomenal that night.  She was very friendly, talkative, helpful, and we could tell from our arrival that she was going to make sure we left happy.  Needless to say, we were very happy.  It almost felt as if we were getting served by our friend.  I wish everybody who goes to BJ's could get her as their waitress.  She was that awesome. All in all, my family has been going to BJs since 2012 in Las Vegas, but our recent trip made us contemplate why we're not going more often on family nights. 5 stars from this guy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=40,3.8,3.34,3.34,3.604,3.524

My salad was soggy and just didn't look appealing for the price. I reordered and got the bacon mac and cheese. This was a much better entree and it felt rich and creamy, but not something I would order again, though I'm sure people that enjoy cheesy pastas in general would like this dish.     My bf's salmon - AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, the couscous was delicious. It was a beautiful looking plate. I would definitely order that next time.  For dessert we decided to be adventurous and got the sampling of three mini pizookies. They were cute and delicious and hot with ice cream on top of each. So decadent. The chocolate one- delicious but a lot of chocolate (chocolate cookie with chocolate ice cream), so be prepared. The peanut butter cookie one- tasted good, especially if you like peanut butter desserts already. The salted caramel one was my favorite by far. I recommend that one for sure.  Overall a good experience. The waitress seemed annoyed when I returned the salad, and she didn't really check on us too much after that. But the food was delicious, ambience was fun.

Both came out really well. I like how they toasted and buttered the top. It was soft and flavorful too. I honestly hope their chain succeeds here.

About 50% of the time I enjoy having the chili in a read bowl.  The few times the bowl was barely carved out.  If there was 1/2 a cup of chili that would be an exaggeration.   My wife had tomato bisque in a bread bowl and experienced the same thing.  She asked for additional soup and the waitress brought out a small cup (1/2 cup?).  We said something about it to the waitress and she just shook her head and said ""sorry- I don't make the bowls.""  If I ever have it again ( I love chili!) I will ask for a bowl and have the bread bowl on the side.    Otherwise,  pizza and other options are good.  Wednesday's are 4$ BJ craft beer nights ( at least for now).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3?start=20,4.16,3.58,3.58,3.564,3.8120000000000003

All they had done was scrape off the stuff that wasn't supposed to be on the first time and brought it back, but it still had it all on it like I wouldn't notice. What if someone had an allergy to something and they did that, it was just a real slap in the face as a customer.

We got sat down and ordered the calamari and the meaty pepperoni extreme pizza. The Cal him I came out first very promptly it was very well cooked crisp and not over battered like it's so common in some places. The marinara sauce though was perfect it was salty enough that it blend in with the calamari. Then the pizza came out in a huge dish very large even though it was a medium I thought it could feed more than four people really. But I had three slices and they were very good a lot a lot a pepperoni and a cheese was pretty good quality. The pizza was covered was a deep dish, covered through which was a struggle to find crust to hold on to lol. But if that's the only issue I had, I feel they have a pretty good setup.

82,Marcus C.,"Boerne, TX",0,59,,3.0,2017-10-01,"Love BJ'S at the Rim.  Have always had 'great bar service' but due to a party of 4; we chose seating. Seating was great and service for 4 was great. All 4 of us ordered the Prime Rib which is served on the weekends only. Wife and I ordered MED and other couple MED RARE and they all came out the same.  The server never 'asked' how the meal was and wife and I just asked for 'to-go' and being polite to our lunch guests just had it 'to go' and the guy even messed up our desert to go. I've been a long time customer with BJ's and know what not to order and what to. I fault the KITCHEN MGR and CHEF for letting such display of that is 'shown in menu' versus what is given. And to continue - They offer a perfect picture of a 'chicken sandwich"" on their front of their menu but what it is. It's a retangler piece of chicken on a round bun. Let the kitchen MGR know he owes me $3.00 as I had to see McDonold's for two cheeseburgers as could not eat the over RARE Prime rib. As far as Pizza - They do no wrong. It's great and fresh - I'll still return but know what to not to have and other to have and will let my friends know the same.

80,Danielle H.,"San Antonio, TX",5,19,55.0,4.0,2017-10-22,"My boyfriend and I decided to go to BJs at about 6:30 on Saturday night to eat and watch the Spurs game at 7. When we arrived, there appeared to be quite a few people waiting, so I was a little nervous about the wait time. When I asked the hostess, she said it was only 10-15min wait, which was surprising and relieving. Right after putting my name in, we noticed a table opening up in the bar area (open seating) so we just took that table.  Although it was very busy, our waiter greeted us immediately, grabbed some menus and silverware for us, and brought out two waters. He was spectacular.  I started off by ordering the new Tito's electric lemonade and my boyfriend ordered a gin and tonic. I loved my drink! A lot of times it's hard to find a drink that's strong, tastes great, and isn't overly sweet. This was perfect! It definitely had a kick, but the lemon flavor mellowed it down quite a bit. It also wasn't too sweet, which is always so hard to find when you order a ""girly"" drink from the cocktail menu. My boyfriend said his gin and tonic was also very well-made. We also started off with the root beer glazed ribs as an appetizer. These had a good, smoky flavor, but they were slightly dry and needed more sauce.  My boyfriend ordered the house top sirloin with the cheddar mashed potatoes, couscous mac and cheese, and a side Caesar salad. He ordered it medium rare and it came out somewhere between rare and medium rare, which he had no problem with. He said it was fantastic and definitely would order it again. He also loved his salad and mashed potatoes, but he said the mac and cheese was weird- that the couscous gave it a really strange texture. He enjoyed everything except for that.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and added a fried egg to it. It was okay. It definitely has potential, but the patty was overcooked and dry and the fried egg wasn't runny at all (which is what I usually get when I order fried eggs on burgers). It came with a side of fries which were amazing- super crispy and fresh. I'd probably still order the burger again because I think it was probably just an off night.  Overall, everything was good. The service was fantastic and the drinks were perfect. A couple points were lost due to minor issues with the food, but we'll definitely still be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-3,4.04,3.72,3.72,,3.8480000000000003

Been coming there since I had moved back to San Antonio last year.  Highly disappointed in the past two times I have come in particularly earlier this week. Came in with my family, the server who came by was rude and seemed in a hurry. Im thinking maybe she's (Hilary) busy okay now worries. We wait almost 10 minutes for a simple 4 waters and a coffee. By the time she came back we were all set ready to order appetizers and everything, she then told us hang on one minute and proceeded to walk to another table. Now I'm livid! SO she finally comes back, we get our order and our food comes out before the appetizers, our steak is undercooked asked for it to be medium. I received it med rare, once it was brought back to me of course it was over cooked to well done. Worst the didn't even bother to place new sides on the plate. So cold mashed potatoes and green beans is what i was forced to eat.  I ask to speak to a manager and no one came to see us. As we were walking out, a female manager never got the name came to speak to us. Gave us her apologies but i feel that she wasn't genuine to our dissatifaction with our dining experience. Typically we have been waited on by Kate, Austin, & Orlando. More so Kate n Orlando than anyone else. Both have provided great service  consistently throughout our time at BJS. Is there any way to request whom we to be severed by? Never have I had this poor of service before at BJS.  How is that their service is far superior that the rest of the staff? Is everyone not trained equally or held to the same standards? I highly doubt i will likely return to this location. Been burned twice in a month first by Saul and now by Hilary, definitely not worth wasting my hard earned money.
