Tried the beer sampler.  Atmosphere was a bit standard with tv's, etc but service was excellent.  Slider burgers were good but pretty salty.  Breaded artechoke hearts were...artechoke-y.  Didn't like em.

183,Kent W.,"Austin, TX",1,11,4.0,5.0,2012-01-31,"Utterly unfamiliar with San Antonio so I couldn't tell you which one we were at, except it was near the Alamo Drafthouse. Honestly from the name we were expecting a Hooter's/Twin Peaks kinda place, and in that respect only was I disappointed. We ordered a mojito and a ""BJ's Irish Root Beer"", which was Jameson's, Bailey's, butterscotch schapps, and their home-brewed root beer. The mojito was good, the Irish Root Beer was fantastic. I drank it too fast, so just had the home-brewed root beer after that, which was every bit as good by itself. The menu was overwhelming; wonderful selection, and it took me a good 20 minutes to narrow down to one dish, and 10 minutes of that was between the jambalaya and the parmesan-crusted chicken. We had the pork chops, and the jambalaya; the pork chops were very good, and the jambalaya was as good as jambalaya gets outside of New Orleans. Hate to gush, but I was VERY impressed with everything we consumed. The service was adequate to good, but the cuisine more than made up for any shortcomings in any other category. I will be back, and very soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.4120000000000004,3.5600000000000005

Mac and cheese are too die for. My comfort food. I love the gold fish sprinkled on top.  Artichokes are delightful with dipping sauce. Meatballs are flavorful. The mozzarella and tomato salad is our favorite with the balsamic glaze. Mini bruschetta are good as well.  We have tried wontons and like the Thai style but not a favorite.  Drinks are good as well as the ambiance.  We enjoy coming here every time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3800000000000003,3.5600000000000005

We requested a booth so the hostess asked if it was okay if she sat us in the bar area, which we had no problem with. Our server, Claudia, was AWESOME. We got some of the best customer service we've ever had. She was very receptive in refilling our drinks and getting us exactly what we wanted in a timely manner. We ended up getting the bang for our buck since it was happy hour. We both got mini pizzas (half off) and had the southwestern egg rolls (half off) as an appetizer. I got the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza and Mr. S got a custom made one with wheat crust, pineapples and grilled chicken. I was a HUGE fan of my pizza. I usually get the buffalo chicken pizza but this was my first time getting the flatbread. Mr. S was not a huge fan of the cheesiness of this pizza, but as a cheese lover, I thought his looked awesome.  We ended up getting a chocolate pazookie for dessert, which was awesome as usual.

I do see a lot of negative posts about BJs (mostly in other cities) but I highly recommend the store on Hwy 281 & TPC. The GM, Kip Welsch is top notch and his staff is as well. If you have a problem, bring it up with Kip or one of the duty managers and I guarentee you that it will be rectified.

Oh, an the Pook's Pilsener- I have had it a few times now and it's always nice; dry and crisp with a substantial malt character that is completely balanced and nuanced by the spicy hops. That beer is one I would buy to take home. Also, the pumpkin ale was one of the best pumpkin ales I have had. Very spicy and kinda heavy/sweet, but overall a very drinkable beer around 5% abv. It's easy to overspice a pumpkin ale, but this one was very smooth and not astringent or ""bitey"" at all. The happy hour in the bar makes it a great time. As long as the Pook's Pils or the Hopstorm IPA is on (or the Oktoberfest) I will keep coming back for the 1/2 price boneless wings... M-F 3-7pm.

Yesterday I returned - my daughters love the avocado spring roll appetizers and wanted me to try them. The rolls were good but not awesome. I remembered the root beer was pretty good last time so I ordered some of that. It was FLAT so I asked the server ""isn't this stuff supposed to be a little carbonated?"" She looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""not really."" So I tried some more but it wasn't right. When the appetizers were brought by another server I asked her about carbonation she said ""yes"" and agreed that it would be gross without bubbles. She took it back. Then our server sheepishly tried to act like it was a misunderstanding. But in fact, she lied and made us feel stupid.

Food was good, and we're not easy to please (see my review of 54th Street Grill, which is nearby.) The margarita flatbread and spinach artichoke dip were actually really tasty.  Calamari was just so so, though. Handcrafted Margaritas on the rocks were really, really good (memorably so). Our server, Spencer, was very polite and professional -- not intrusive, just right. He did an excellent job and it made our experience pleasant. The decor is interesting and comfortable.

If you read them, you know I was very unhappy with the treatment I received from the manager on shift the evening I went. This follow up post describes how BJ's management made every effort to right a wrong! How awesome is that?!! Too often these days people & business do not hold themselves accountable. I was very happy to see that in this instance BJ's did the right thing! Not only did I post a comment on Yelp!, but I also contacted BJ's directly through their website to make them aware of my experience. Shortly after, I was contacted by Eli, the Operations Manager for BJ's. Eli inquired about my experience & offered his apologies, he strongly, yet politely expressed that the treatment myself & my family received is not representative of the customer service promoted by BJ's. He seemed sincerely concerned that one of his managers would be so rude to any of the patrons. Eli stated that he would be coming to the restaurant to provide this manager with further training in how best to handle the situation I described in my earlier post.  In addition, Eli invited myself & my mother to the restaurant to treat us to lunch as an extension of his apology. My mother & I went for lunch & had a fantastic experience!

It was a first visit for all of us, and we asked for their quietest booth. Although there were TV's playing, the noise was not overwhelming where we were seated. The ambiance is young but not noisy/crazy ... more professional and Yuppie. Now for the food.  Our appetizers were the fried calamari (a large portion of tiny squid cuts, lightly battered and crispy) and the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli (basically, 4 large, soft hush puppies, only much tastier, and with a spicy bacon-y sauce!). My Dad ordered the House Top Sirloin at $13.95 and he said it was excellent and cooked perfectly to his order. He also ""accidentally"" ordered the tomato basil soup and said it's the only time he's ever enjoyed tomato soup! I tasted it, and it was truly delicious ... thick, chunky and fresh.  My Mother had the chicken tortilla soup. It was the creamy type, with nice chunks of chicken as well as fresh avocado. There was a fresh slice of lime floating in it, in case you wanted an extra zing in your soup ... a nice touch. Her hamburger was perfectly cooked also. After our appetizers, I didn't want a big entree, so I ordered the appetizer portion of Gourmet Mac and Cheese. This was my only slight disappointment.  It was described as ""Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic. Topped with seasoned bread crumbs and smoked bacon."" However, I was unable to discern any cheese except perhaps some parmesan in the topping. The pasta was served in its baking dish and was quite tasty in its butter-and-oil with the seasoned topping; there was not much, if any, cheese that I could tell.  Nevertheless, at $4.95 for quite a large appetizer portion (which included two large garlic breads), I was very satisfied. Our waitress, ""Sam"" was outstanding. She was on the ball, paid extra attention to my elderly parents, and I even saw her practically running several times when things got busier.

I don't know, the peach and alcohol just didn't mix well. I asked Willy if I could try the strawberry margarita instead and he said no problem and gave me a strawberry one instead. The strawberry margarita was delicious, much better choice and our server was super cooperative and polite about it.  I than ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and the steak meal.

She was not paying attention and she turned around and apologized because she wasn't working because there was only two people in the entire restaurant. We ordered food and our waitress forgot our drink. App came out swimming in oil and undercooked. Seriously? It's fried... How can you undercook something that is fried. And the app came with such little on it. We hardly touched it even when we were hungry. We got our entrees with still no drink, and there fake chicken and with a fake pita stared me in the face. I have got to say this was by far the nastiest food I have ever had. The entrees look NOTHING like the picture and everything rings cheap. This place has high prices for what?  And thanks to the waitress who kept on flirting with my friend's boyfriend who didn't end up paying. Wrong way to be a server. Everyone counts.  To end, we were charged drinks that we never got.

59,Kat S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,10.0,4.0,2016-07-13,I've come here a few times and the service was mediocre as well as the hospitality. The food as well. Today was different. Don't mind the PokeGo fanatics out there ( they don't really bother any and I can't complain I stocked up on some balls while here). Upon entering they greeted us kindly and asked if we were rewards members. I said yes and gave them my information. They then welcomed us back and say us. The waitress was great and personable. When I ordered my food I verified there was no mushrooms as I have allergies and she confirmed there wasn't and also said that they had me marked down as having a mushroom allergy on her notes. Something they added to my profile. I was impressed as it made me feel like I was not just another customer. Even if I was but in my head we were friends lol.

79,Shawn M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,1.0,2016-07-16,"Went on a Friday night. Hostess was very polite and courteous. An accurate time was given for our party to be seated. However, that concludes the my compliments of this establishment. Once our waiter, Blake, heard we weren't ordering alcohol, he decided our party was far less important than his other tables. Seldom seen from that point forward and never with a smile. Food took over 30 min from the time we ordered. I watched other pizzas be brought out that were ordered after mine by our waiter with no explanation. The deep dish pizza I finally received had a few meatballs in the center of the pizza with a couple diced tomatoes in the same area, but I basically paid $20 for soggy cheese bread. Awful. No silverware till minutes after our food was brought and our waiter was nonexistent. Save your money, time, and aggravation.

27,E. F.,"Bonsall, CA",0,8,,1.0,2016-07-19,"I ate here with a large group, 25+ people. When the staff set up the tables into 1 very long one, they put our party against the wall. The table was so close to the wall that when you were scooted up to the table the back of the chairs still touched the wall. There was no room to maneuver out to get to the restrooms etc. For those of us sitting against the wall it was a solid 5 degrees warmer and uncomfortable. One person in our party is Gluten-free by necessity, not choice. They requested a Gluten Free menu upon entering the restaurant and was told they had to go find one. This never received it and had to look up the GF menu online on a phone, only to see that BJ's Gluten Free options are very few . . . 2 steaks, a few salads and GF pizza. As we were ordering, we were told that one of the pizza ovens was out. Later we found out they were down 2 cooks as well. Our food took forever to come out. Our party had many children. One of the waiters was taking food orders directly from children, not 10 or 12 year olds. She took food orders from 3, 5, and 7 year olds without consulting the parents. The parents had already ordered a pizza for their kids to share, to make dinner not so expensive. The parents ordered the pizza with one waiter, while the waitress took the kids' order without checking with the parents. When the food came out there was a pizza and 3 kids meals, and some upset parents.  All the kids' food came out middle to last of all the orders and missing their sides. My daughter had not been served all her food by the time I finished my meal. Two of the 3 steaks arrived at the table well done rather than medium rare as they had ordered. I ordered a steak and potato and although my steak was cooked properly (unlike the other 2) it was one of the most flavorless cuts of beef I have ever eaten. My husband ordered a burger and found it to be mediocre.  Menus were not removed from the table. Our table was not bussed when plates emptied. Friends in our party had to move the plates to another table so that we had room on the table, or so that empty plates would not fall off the stacks of menus in the middle of the table.

Now that I've moved to Texas I've been to the 3 near me as well as one in Austin. BJ's favorite deep dish is my go to pizza with its concoction of meats with olives, tomatoes, onion, bell peppers and mushrooms. I finish it off with their Jeremiah Red beer. BJ's has a large line of their own craft beer. Their Oktoberfest and Hefe is pretty good too.  I like the Nutty Brown if I'm just getting apps because I get way too full.  Other faves:  Watermelon and feta salad. This is I believe seasonal. I like it so much that I sometimes remake it at home however I don't have that honey vinaigrette down pat yet.  Crispy artichokes are by far my favorite app. Artichoke with a lemon is fireworks in your mouth. So much robust flavor  that you don't know what is going on.  Bad dish I've got? Ahi poke.... I actually got it at the other SA location and yes I know 3 years living in Hawaii you can't judge Texas poke. However I'm rating it against the few times I've had it in Texas and it was horrendous. A slab of chunked ahi with nothing on it. I know I'm not on Oahu anymore but places in Houston, Austin, and even Yard House make better poke.  Service is usually good.

(25 total) then she took our actual entree order. She left and a new guy brought out our entree about 20 more minutes later. She didn't check up one time to see how our food was or anything. She did give me dipping sauce which I will count her for. I checked to see if she was busy, at some points I saw her laughing with some friends, engaging with other tables and not once did she with us. So when we actually finish our food she gets a box and we order a pizookie. It takes a good 15 minutes for her to even come over to us and say I'll go see where it is. So finally another guy brings it up. It was stiff, ice cream barely melted. Terrible. I was dissatisfied so was my friend. I was also pissed she was so engaged with other tables and refilling their drinks and when it came to us we were just a hurry up table. She gets our checks out and cashes us quickly.

I am not a huge beer drinker but decided thats what I wanted to try today. They had a nice sampler option to select four beers to try which will be more than enough if you're a lightweight like myself. I recommend the Founders which is a beer and cider if you are also not used to drinking beer. It has the slight bitterness of beer but the sweetness of a cider. The Shandy was second on my list which is a golden beer and lemonade, the third is the Hefeweizen which helps you smoothly exit out of fruity and into the world of beer without a kick in the mouth!  This is smooth, not overwhelming and just right to make the transition. I was not a fan of the Jeremiah Red because it was too bitter for my liking.  As far as the food The golden beet and arugula salad was delicious as was the prime rib. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Also, I might add, it was huge and the meal comes with mash potatoes, asparagus and dessert! Very well done.  Prices are also not overwhelmingly expensive ($$).  I will definitely come back to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=20,3.52,3.7,3.7,,3.6280000000000006
0,Erica S.,"San Antonio, TX",60,172,438.0,4.0,2017-08-15,"Somehow I've never been to a BJ's before. I found this place looking on yelp for somewhere on my way home to get ahi poke (I was really craving it). I was really happy with my experience here - I sat at the bar during happy hour. The poke was so fresh and super quick to come out. It had a bunch of different veggies and a great poke sauce. I enjoyed it so much I ordered another togo for lunch the next day. Just under $11, I wish they would discount it a little on their happy hour. I also got a glass of wine that was on happy hour. It's a 7oz pour of Dark Horse for $5. Good deal. The bartender was attentive, quick and friendly to everyone. Just what you want when you're sitting at the bar. I'll definitely be back!  Bonus- they have a lot of lower calorie items on their menu that sound really good. Which is hard to find when dining out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.56,3.73,3.73,,3.6620000000000004
15,Diane M.,"TX, TX",0,3,3.0,1.0,2017-08-17,"I was here with my husband and our party after our wedding a while back and was terrified to come back after a very disgusting problem with their sourdough bread bowl/soup combo. While I was about to finally finish my ""meal"" (I adored this meal a lot and go there for it!) I noticed dark green mold under my bread and reported to the waiter. The waiter was very unmoved when I told her about the mold- she assumed it was dye until she brought it to the kitchen then the manager who was slightly defensive about how ""this never happens""- eventually  paid for our food.  I'm fine with what happened and it was all sorted out. But by how large the mold under the bread made me feel nervous on how long the other breads been there. It's been months and my whole group of party members are aware when they saw it. It will be a while till I come here. Good thing there's plentiful restaurants out there at least!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.4,3.7,3.7,,3.5800000000000005

Our server was attentive, amiable, and knowledgeable about all the specials. We already knew what we wanted and she put our order in really quickly. We were very happy with our service and quality of our meals. This particular location is doing a great job vs others in the Central Texas area I have purveyed.

30,Debbi D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,1.0,2017-10-29,"Went late on a Sunday night, ordered 2 entrees, 1 house sirloin and 1 parmesean crusted chicken. Server brought out both entrees but steak was under done, we asked to put it back on a few minutes as ordered medium well. Waitress came over to check on us and we told her the steak was undercooked and we were waiting on it to come back. Split the chicken entree while awaiting the steak. Steak never came out. Waitress came to check on us  again and we asked how long for the steak as it had been well over 15 minutes and we were done with the other entree. She checked and came back and said it would be a few minutes. Manager then comes out and says, sorry I dont know what happened but here is your steak. He cut into it and it was more undercooked than the original. I said to forget it and we will pay for the chicken but not the steak. Another server brought us the bill and the manager comped the steak and half the chicken. The issues isnt the mistakes but that no one seemed to care. Manager should have handled more professionally and apologized and brought the check herself and explained. If you dont care then neither  do I and we will not return. We were never rude or unreasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=20,3.56,3.69,3.69,,3.6380000000000003
12,Bob T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,3.0,2.0,2017-12-08,First let me say I have been a fan of this place with no less than bi weekly visits for the last 5 years. I love the waitstaff there they make the place work. That being said the last few visits will be my last due to the fact that they are misrepresenting there value . The happy hour specials are smoking mirrors I ordered there JN burger what the fail to tell you is that the burger on the happy our is 1/2 the patty you get when you order it on the regular menu I brought that to their attention also the sliders are a patty cut in 1/4 that's not a true slider . It side be 4 -2 oz patties again smoking mirrors. In short if your going to offer happy hour specials don't advertise at the normal menu items for a better price then cut back on the portions that is misleading the customers. By the way when I brought this up the manager never even came to the table . To many other places to get treated better especially after being a loyal customer for years,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.48,3.7,3.7,,3.6120000000000005
1,Kenny P.,"San Antonio, TX",14,25,3.0,2.0,2017-12-16,"Ordered appetizers and asked to get the appetizer first before entrees. Received the appetizers about 10 minutes later, about 30 seconds before the entrees arrived. They took the entrees back and brought them back well after appetizers were gone. Looks like the food was thrown back in the oven to keep warm?. Everything was well done. Shrimp don't taste good well done. The menu picture of the shrimp, asparagus and penne plate showed about 9 pieces of penne pasta and several more shrimp. My plate arrived with 5 shrimp and boat load of penne pasta, 50 or 70?? People who are watching your carbs... don't order this over priced plate of mostly pasta.  The Arnold Palmer was great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.52,3.68,3.68,,3.6160000000000005

The wait staff was pretty darn good, the starters came out and the mains came out efficiently and with good timing. I usually like BJs for their happy hour specials and TVs but tonight's dinner with the family was excellent. Place is packed on weekend nights, reservations are good but we were able to get a seat as a walk in party of 5 on a Saturday night, barely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.48,3.68,3.68,,3.6000000000000005
4,K H.,"San Antonio, TX",1,20,1.0,2.0,2018-01-01,First and last time we will visit this restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were seated right away. The table we were given was dirty and crumbs all over the seat - it had been wiped but not very well. Still had dry ketchup and other sticky smears on it. When we told the hostess she gave it a half hearted wipe down and said it was just the granite variations and gave us attitude.  The server was nice enough. Food took a long time to come even though the restaurant was half full. Tells me they don't staff the kitchen appropriately.  Burgers we ordered were good and the fries were really good. One of our party ordered a salad and had to send it back. Lettuce was very soggy and wilted. As if they put dressing on way before bringing it out. Flatbread pizza was not good as well. Crust was chewy instead of crispy that you would expect. Wings were good but unevenly coated in the sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio,3.48,3.67,3.67,,3.5940000000000003
