516,Lisa F.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,,4.0,2012-01-03,"You can never go wrong with BJ's. Came here a few nights ago with my boyfriend. We got seated outside which I was happy about until we were leaving. Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because by the end of our meal, they had seated a party of almost 25 people directly behind my boyfriend. They were so loud, It was to the point where I could barely hear him talking from across they table. As I was finishing my dinner, we had a 'lovely' view of some guys ass a foot away from our faces! There was also about three other tables of 2 or 3 people. If you know you're seating a huge party outside, don't seat smaller parties near them.  Other than that, the food was great and our waiter did a great job getting our food correct and checking in on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=560,3.24,3.12,3.304,3.152,3.1680000000000006

596,Ewa H.,"San Jose, CA",1,13,1.0,1.0,2012-01-04,"So my friends and I using our day off (Jan2)to get some bargains at the mall and had a craving for BJ's.  We love their appetizers and of course, the pizookie.  Who doesn't love the pizookie?  The wait was crazy, but we held out since we could see all the yummy food being served.  There were quite a few tables that were empty, but the wait was almost 45 mins to 1hr  for 3 people.  When we were finally seated, the wait staff was running like chickens with their heads cut off.  When our waiter came by to get our drink order, we asked him what was up. He said the manager didn't expect the restaurant to be so busy so they understaffed.  WOW.  I'm surprised that they didn't staff up on a day that most people have off from work. We order some fun martinis since we know we'll be at the mall for awhile, and start off with some appetizers.  Well, we are waiting... and waiting... for our drinks, but to no avail.  Our appetizers come, and once we are almost done with them, our drinks arrive!!  The bar is backed up... the waiter apologizes.  Okay, i get it.   No problem. But wow... almost 30 mins for drinks?!?! He comes to get our entree order (not sure why he waited till after we ate our appetizers) but I order my favorite, the sesame chicken salad.  Since it's the new year, I'm sticking to my new years resolution of not eating meat. So I order the salad with no chicken and potato skins with no bacon.  So when I've ordered dishes with no meat at other places, they either discount the dish by a few bucks or give you more veggies to compensate.  Ummm, not BJ's.  Of course, I understand the potato skins only have the bacon as a garnish, but the chicken salad has substantial chicken on it!  And the salad didn't come out bigger than usual... it was just the same size salad with no chicken!  For a salad that costs almost $12, I would think there would be some discount if it was ordered with no meat. I asked to see a manager, just to inquire about how they accommodate guests that don't eat meat and if there exists and type of discount for dishes that exclude meat.  The place was so busy that they didn't really care to get me a manager.  We paid the bill, but waited to talk to someone.  It was clear that I was a last priority.  They wanted the table since they were so backed up with guests, that we left without talking to anyone. I'm giving 1 star for bad customer service.  Essentially, it was the principle of the matter.  I don't care if the food is great and people are lined up to eat there, but if you treat your customers badly, it will essentially erode your feeling about the place.  It was just a series of customer service errors that makes me not want to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500,3.24,3.13,3.296,2.8520000000000003,3.174

Our waiter comes back and notices the tab was gone. Turns out the squeaky voice chick took the tab and rung it up under her and she got the tip. For about 30 mins we watch her yell at our nice waiter saying she rung it up on herself on accident. The managers got involved and had to try to fix our checks.

The sever was very unfriendly and very bad at hosting the restaurant guests.  Following is our experience at this place along with our visiting guests. * The server did not get the drinks for every body after the order is taken.  Need to remind her several times to get one of our drink. We got this drink after 10 minutes.      * Did not bring enough plates (brought 5 for 6 people) for serving the Appetizers /Starters. Again need to remind her to get the extra plates.      * Did not clean up the Appetizers dishes before serving  the main course and we need to ask for her to clean them.      * Did not bring enough plates again for the main course. We need to ask again for the plates.      * No Ketchup was served with the French Fries Order for Kids. Need to ask the server  again for it. This time she brings the whole bottle of Ketchup with a big attitude.      * No refill of water / drinks was offered for any guests during the entire time.      * The server did not bother asking if we need any thing else during the time we are having the dinner.      * At the end, I have asked her that I need to talk to her supervisor and she told us that he is going come to our table, but never showed up even after we wait at the table for 5 minutes.     * I went to the front reception and saw the manager (Mr. Robert) to share my experience and he showed the very least interest in the whole incident when I am telling him about our experience.

What compels me to write is when either something really stands out positively or drastically horrible.  I've noticed I didn't have a three star review yet, and after my visit to BJs last night, it screamed mediocre! Yet .... I cannot avoid this place. I've been here many of times. A lot with an alcoholic German ex-boyfriend (who loved the beer samplers) and the other times when my friends and I were craving a pizookie while shopping.  BJs does its theme well, which is, beer and an extensive menu. A place where groups are ideal, since there are a variety of options. Even the pickiest eaters are bound to find something they want.  I will speak about my experience last night.  Why in fucks sake did I come on a Friday night? I should have known better. It's like I had temporary Alzheimer's. After an hour wait, we were seated in a comfy booth. However the door opening and closing from the patio made it a quite chilly experience. The waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Since we have perused the menu during our hour wait, we were ready to order and get our hungry tummies filled ASAP.  I decided I wanted  variety of things. I ordered from the small bites menu. I ordered the chicken wontons (buffalo style), stuffed mushrooms, and mac n cheese.  So while we were sitting down, our waitress and her replacing waitress decided to talk about their schedule right in front of us. Meaning we had to stop our conversation so that the waitresses can continue their conversation regarding when she's taking her break or when she was leaving for the day. Ummm ok? She did apologize and honestly, its not a big deal. It was really awkward though.  I got my food. The mushrooms were cold and unremarkable. The wontons were pretty tasty and loved the buffalo style nature of it. Never knew Asian and New York American flavors go together. It was a fun dish.  Finally the mac n cheese. It didn't taste cheesy at all. It tasted like cold pasta with no sauce. It was sent back, the waitress happily obliged and took it off our bill.  We decided to share the trio pizookie dessert. Hot cookies and ice cream will never fail me. We had the macadamia nut, red velvet, and cookies and cream. Delicious, you can't go wrong. However, we received the bill prior to receiving our dessert. WAY PRIOR. It was just weird again. Then I noticed a bread plate going to our neighbors and I realized we never got our complimentary bread. Overall, the service was bust but unintentionally.

I have the Chicken Marsala, Piranha Pale Ale Chili, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, and a Wildberry Mojito. The chili was good but I felt it was a bit cold maybe due to the glob o sour cream put on on. Otherwise it was very good. The Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms were very good as well. This would make it the second time I've had it and as I recall, not as salty as it was the first time. The Chicken Marsala was pretty good. I just wish there was a bit more pasta. The majority of the dish was the chicken, the mushrooms, and green beans. I guess the green beans are there to make you feel less guilty about how many calories are in the dish :-). The Wildberry Mojito was very good but I wish the taste of mint of more prominent. Don't get me wrong, the drink tasted great and gave me a good buzz. Compared to other places though, it could have had a bit more mint taste. Overall my experience this time was great.

Boyfriend reported dry pork chops, while still very flavorful. I can attest to his delicious mashed potatoes myself.

Enough about that, the desserts are so yummmmy. Pizookies are amazing! If you don't know what that is, it's a huge warm cookie with ice cream on top. You can have 2 different cookies in one dessert. For instance, red velvet cookie and chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  White chocolate macadamia is pretty good also too!  So, you have to make room for dessert.

We ordered 2 chicken parm and one spaghetti dish and wasn't told till 20 minutes later that their was no more chicken breast. Like im pretty sure you ran out way before so you couldve saved us the time and told us when we ordered. 30 minutes passes and we finally get our food. What really ticked me off more was that the spaghetti dish was just warm and not steaming hot like the others. It's obvious they let that dish sit there for 20 minutes while making the last two orders. You'd think theyd put our orders in the front to make first since one pasta dish was already done but guess not. On top of that one of the plates was missing garlic bread like how can you not notice there's no bread on a plate when there's two plates that have it?!!!?

I didn't have any but man did it look dry. My brother couldn't finish it because he was choking on every bite and finally gave up. My flatbread on the other hand was pretty good. It had a nice crisp to it and the flavors were well balanced. So our lunch meal obviously had mixed reviews.  After that, we wanted some pizookies since I was craving them. We ordered the trio and chose white chocolate chip, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry almond pizookies. Boy were they delicious! You have to have a piece the minute it arrives at your table. The ooey gooey softness of the cookie along with some cold ice cream, ooh they make your eyes roll. But if you let it cool for a while, everything will taste super sweet and it could get quite sickening. Trust me, even with three small pizookies, we had a hard time finishing those.

This review is way overdue.  I came here for happy hour by myself.  Yes, you read that right.  I wanted to de-stress after taking an exam so I decided that I was going to treat myself to BJ's since I hadn't been there in a couple of years.  I really need to get out more often. MY ORDER (HAPPY HOUR) - Mini bruschetta: These were a bit dry-- I felt like I was a parrot eating crackers!  Still decent as an appetizer though.  Even though they look pretty small, one bite is a mouthful ( ). - Spinach-stuffed mushrooms:  I loved this.  You could tell each mushroom was full of flavor.  So juicy!  I'm such a sucker for these things.  They were gone within minutes ( ). - Birthday pizookie: Best thing at BJ's.  Seriously, if you've been here and haven't tried their pizookie, what were you doing?!  A wad of ice cream on top of a warm cookie.  Irresistible goodness.  Good thing I don't eat here often cause I would end up with a pizookie top ( ). I didn't have to wait to be seated, but the wait for the food took forever, even though it was 3 pm on a Wednesday and half the place was empty.  And when you're by yourself, the time passes by twenty times slower than it actually does.  Everything was half off during happy hour, so the bill came out to around $9 including tax and tip.  Sweeeet.  Definitely worth coming here for happy hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=280,3.4,3.1,3.184,2.544,3.2200000000000006

Don't even bother trying to place a to-go order on a busy night! My parents love the food here, but every time I call to place an order I get left on hold-- last time I had to call 4 times and wait over 40 minutes to talk to someone at the take-out desk! Also, they will tell you that the order will be done in 20 minutes, and then when you show up 20 minutes later they will make you wait for another 40 before your order is ready! The workers are very polite, but it is still some of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had, repeated on many occasions.

We were really excited because he said there were rave reviews on yelp about the pizza   we walked in we were not appropriately greeted by the hostess and actually to my dismay disregarded that we were even there and went on with her conversation.After what I thought was a rude welcoming she finally decided to greet us.The next hostess did a little better job and asked us how we were  and kindly seated   me that is a big part of the ""restaurant experience""and they failed in that   the kids got kids menu pizzas, and we ordered a medium pan pizza to split.The waiter was average but he didn't seemed to thrilled to be there at   the pizza arrives and looks delicious but it is not at all piping hot and the cheese is barely melted.I could not see or taste any sauce at all.The one good thing was that the toppings did taste good and fresh.After mentioning this to the waiter the manager did come over and comp us for  another pizza.But really ,we are not going back for the pizza ever.Who  wants cold pizza,maybe the kids but not me I need piping hot pizza that I can barely eat.If I wanted cold pizza I could have stayed home and ordered it.The waiter service was also very average.He didn't even bring us cheese and peppers and we had to flag him down after walking past our empty glasses on the edge of thte table which Im pretty sure he saw after walking by five times.Overall gonna have to give them 2 stars......

C) Some of the food is actually better than the Cheesecake Factory.  D) The service is off and on, but most of the time pretty great.  E) If you're here late, enjoy watching the drunk suburban sports' fans at the bar. F) The manager doesn't like to work. He's lazy.  What's great is that they know who they're supposed to be. They're not trying to be something they're not, and that makes for a good restaurant. It's standard American fare, but curated and executed with restraint. Located next to the movie theaters, this is a great place to stop before or after a film. Or, you could take a stroll through the mall to knock off some of those pounds you just put on eating that Pizookie!

Up until recently, I would say the past could of months there service went completely down hill. They got a new manager a short mexican guy who obviously does not care about the restaurant or its employees. We had two bad experiences since new management came on board. First time: I order a pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The pasta came out first, of course i was going to wait til his burger came out, its a burger how long could it possibly take. I swear it took 8-10 minutes for the burger to come out! My plate was completely cold and to top it off it was the wrong burger! This was not on a busy night, so NO excuse could make this situation right. When i told the waitress she became completely defensive and said that she only puts in the orders its up to the cooks to get the order right! I ask to speak to the manager and she said ""Hes too busy"" and walked away. My boyfriend immediately got mad and left $15 enough for my plate and our two Cokes.  Second Time:  It took a long time for our waiter to come to our table to get our order. Where we were sitting the manager was directly kiddy corner from us talking to our waiter about the baseball game that was on TV. Me and my boyfriend came back for a Sunday lunch after shopping. I got a soup and salad combo and he got a sandwich. after he took our order it was not a long wait from our food. By the time we got our food, my boyfriend was ready for refill on his soda. The manager and our waiter were talking again. My boyfriend put his hand up and made eye contact with the waiter to come over. The waiter then turn his back on us and continued talking to the manager!! I couldn't believe how rude he was being and the manager did not say anything to him! I told my boyfriend that i would share my drink with him and it will just come out of his tip!(We always tip really good atleast 20% if service is excellent we tip 25% my mom was a waitress her whole life and she taught me to always tip well) so we done with our food. about 5 minutes went by and my boyfriend seen our waiter and once again signaled for him to come over. he went straight to the bar. another 5-10 minutes went by and we are just sitting there! i become extremely anger and walked straight up to the manager and said we have not seen our waiter for nearly 15 minutes.

Went there for a friend's birthday dinner and the wait was expected being a Saturday night, that didn't bother me at all.  The food was good, had the potstickers, really good! However, the portion was too small, even for an appetizer. My issue was with the service! Our FIRST waiter came to take our drink order, and came back 10 minutes later. She than told us that we would have a new waiter, I'm thinking ok, she's getting off work, but she was still there for the next 2 hours we were there. It felt odd we were tossed to another waiter. This new waiter we got was lazy and sarcastic. He wouldn't come back when we asked for refills, over and over. The real kicker was my friend got one of those free pizookies for signing up with there mailing list, but had to wait for the email coupon to come. It wasn't coming to his email, and he signed up right there at the restaurant too. Our second waiter said he would go ask the manager for approval to do it anyways, but never came back. We had to flag down this waitress with a crumby attitude, she said no to the approve and said he would just have to wait for the email for next time. We finally flagged down our waiter, and he said he never got around to a manager, and we told him what his colleague said, he grabbed her over to ask about it and she YELLS at him in front of us saying she already told us no and blah blah... This woman was not a manager either. Our waiter, however, apologized for her behavior and said for the wait and the scene, that he would make it on the house for him. Which we appreciated.  Than when it came time for our checks. The snotty waitress printed our checks wrong and when i pointed out the error, she chuckles and says, ""well than you just don't have to pay more anymore."" Wow, sorry for being honest, and we payed with cash, I didn't get my change. I asked for my change from the waiter, he chuckled and said, ""you want your change?"", than walks over to the table next to them and ask if they have change because I i wanted my change!

Was told the wait would be about 45 minutes. They do not take reservations for less than 10 people. Kids love this place so we decided to wait. After about an hour we asked what the position was the guy at the table said we were a party of 7 (4 adults, one high chair and 2 less than 5 years old) and needed a larger booth. He then told us that there was a booth being cleared in the pub section and we can get that table as it was first come first serve. I ran over to reserve the spot but as I approached someone else got there before me. You would think that if there were first come first serve seating in a section, we might have been able to secure a seat an hour and a half earlier???? We then requested to speak to some up the chain... this is where it gets interesting... the lady told us we could sit outside.. or wait till more till the 2 tables were free(mind you all this while adjacent tables were emptying and people after us were being serviced because they were smaller parties). It was hot outside and the kids were beginning to get cranky especially the little one. We still wanted to talk to the manager and then someone miraculously showed up. She began attempting to explain our situation to him with her spin on it. I explained to the manager our situation, where he asked front desk guy what we were told the wait was. He told him we were told 45 minutes(doubt that guy will be there for long), then he asked if it was 45 minutes since we were here?????? Then I knew what I was dealing with... it continues....  He asked how long we were there, to which I replied for almost an hour and a half where she interjected saying I had said an hour before and now I was telling the manager it was an hour and a half. Since were at the front, I asked the front desk guy to tell us how long our wait was and still going on(I still had our buzzer with me)... needless to say she was wrong and proved wrong by her own staff. She was miffed big time!! Regardless, it was becoming a scene and we were surrounded by wait staff and one of the dudes became aggressive(Z was his name?) and told us to just leave while my other friend was still talking to the manager.

518,Loren C.,"Miami, FL",322,67,72.0,2.0,2013-07-21,"Usually my friends and I will just pop in for a late night pizookie, or a baked potato, and the food is decent. The service has never been exceptionally good here, but we never really minded. Sometimes the wait is long, and other times you get seated right away. It really just depends on what time you get there. The worst experience I had there was when my boyfriend and I were out on a date. We both ordered appetizers, and they came pretty quickly. I had the fried artichoke hearts, which were decent, although not something I'll ever go back for, and he had the mozzarella sticks. They weren't anything special either. Both appetizers were pretty bland, and such a waste of money. For our main course I ordered a grilled salmon Caesar salad, and this is where things went bad. It took them an incredibly long time to bring out our food, much longer than it should have. When it was brought out to me, it was more like a stack of lettuce than a salad. There was literally no dressing on 2/3rds of my salad! I could pick up a scoop of lettuce with my bare hands and no dressing would get on me at all. I asked our waiter for extra dressing, but I only got it after I had decided to stop eating. The reason that I stopped eating my ""salad"" was because I was continuously finding brown pieces of wilting lettuce throughout my salad. At first I attributed the brown pieces to being rubbed up against my grilled salmon, but I found a large number of pieces of ROTTING lettuce buried at the bottom of my salad on the opposite end of my plate from my salmon fillet. It was disgusting that they would serve rotten food like it was nothing! I found the head of the lettuce, rotten, thrown into my salad as well! I wondered if they had put all the throw away pieces on a plate and mistaken it for my salad... Needless to say, I was thoroughly disgusted and couldn't continue eating it. We pointed it out to the waiter and asked to speak with the manager about it. The manager took a while to come out and speak with us, but she apologized for the wait and thanked us for being patient, and offered us a replacement salad, or anything else off of the menu. I declined, because I was too grossed out to eat anything else from their kitchen. She removed the charge from our bill, and was very kind about the whole situation, which we appreciated.  Needless to say, we will not be returning for anything other than a pizookie in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=560,2.84,3.12,3.1,2.6640000000000006,3.0080000000000005

499,Allen R.,"San Jose, CA",180,14,101.0,2.0,2013-07-22,"I worked retail in Oakridge Mall for a year and would commonly eat lunch at BJ's. I was attracted to the food selections, but progressively the taste and the service got worse and worse.  On numerous occasions our party would alert the waiter that we were on a 1 hour lunch, and on almost all of those occasions we wouldn't receive our food until after 40 minutes of being seated (while ordering within 5 minutes of arriving).  THE FOOD: I ordered the fried shrimp most often, and I always complained about either the fries being cold and/or the shrimp being cold and not fresh tasting. It got to the point where they'd ask if I wanted ""wedges"" or ""thin fries"" and I'd answer, ""whichever is hotter""... to which they'd stare blankly... to which after receiving my fries I would send back for hotter ones.   I like the watermelon feta salad the best. It is $2.99 and it tastes fresh.  The pizza is interesting... I've tried many, and they all taste good, not great, nothing to write home about.  SUMMARY: If you're coming to drink and chill with friends it is a good place to go as they have tons of drinks and the ambiance is nice. I do NOT reccomend this place to my friends, and I avoid it whenever given a choice between BJ's, Chili's, Fridays, Outback, etc..

I added a star just for her doing this! Ive had plenty of dishes here in the past but this last time I went for the Double Deluxe Burger. This thing is HUGE, 2100 calories or so according to the menu. I also added the side salad. Overall the burger was good. A little greasy, but not to the point where the buns are soggy. I feel like the special sauce they use is a little tame, because to be honest it tasted like any other burger I've had. I think the sauce is what would (should) distinguish it from other burgers.

I, for one, have very high expectations when it comes to eating in a restaurant but at the same time am very understanding. Let's start with the service. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse contains many varieties of servers which will be randomly selected in accord to which table we sit in. We have to accept the fact that there will be good & bad servers which is apparent in every restaurant. Having one bad server does not define the whole quality of the restaurant because there are some pretty great & enthusiastic servers that we have to miss out on. Random selecting can be unfortunate sometimes. Fortunately, I had a decent, generous server who took our orders well & delivered our food & beverages quickly & gracefully. Yes, it was busy & the server didn't give as much attention towards us, but it's understandable. We weren't the only ones in the restaurant & I was glad that he showed how much he cared.  There are many varieties of food in the menu. It's like a novel! For the food, I ordered ahi poke for starters & a grilled atlantic salmon. Both of the food were FANTASTIC. The appetizer came out on time & although the salmon took a little bit longer than I thought, it was fine. I had a really good time eating with my friends. I would highly recommend any seafood dish at BJ's! At the end, we shared an oreo pizookie which was incredibly mouthwatering & tasty.

Even when we came early around 4:30 PM we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we could get seated. The service here is okay. It's usually pretty slow, but our server always stopped by every time we tried to wave her down.  For some reason, all of the silverware and utensils we had were filthy. We had utensils that still had food stuck to them, cups that had stains in them (one's that you could scrap off with a fingernail) and plates that had things stuck to them too. Didn't make me feel too good when I saw how dirty everything was. Made me wonder how the dishes that the food was served on looked before they got to the table.  Food wasn't anything too special. The highlight of the meal was probably the avocado egg rolls but I could just be biased because I love avocados and a sweet sauce. We also got a deep dish pizza and southern fried chicken. Pizza wasn't anything too special and chicken was just okay. Nothing that really wowed us.  Pazookies used to be one of my favorite desserts, but there was something off about the pazookie. Something didn't taste right and I wasn't sure if it was because of my taste buds. It was something in the cookie that tasted off, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. White chocolate macadamia nut is my absolute favorite pazookie, I'll probably give it another try the next time we have a huge group dinner outing to see if it's any different.

Every time we have gone something always goes wrong.  Two out of the passed 7 times a manager has came to apologize to us without us even complaining! That's when you know you have messed up. Appetizers are brought out after entrees, food still cold, water cups never filled, the list goes on and on. The last visit was the icing on the cake. They pointed at where we were supposed to sit, didnt walk us. Table still had dishes and the bill/tip from previous people. They picked the dishes up and never wiped the table. There were crumbs all over which we ended up wiping down ourselves. I ordered a soup which never came out. When entrees came out 40 minutes later (we had a party of 4 and went on a Sunday night) I told the waitress the soup never came out and I didn't want it anymore. She came to check on us when we were almost finished eating and said she's going on a break here is your new waitress. When we got the bill the soup was still on there and I told the waitress to please take it off because I never received the soup. She said she wasnt our original waitress when the food was being ordered so we would have to wait for the other one to come back. I told her I'm not going to sit here and wait for the other waitress to come back that's ridiculous. She ended up just removing it herself that was that.

We asked if they could take it off the bill.  Service was slow- slower than normal.  Flora and I ordered fish and chips.  I've had better fish and chips when Jack and the Box had it on the menu.   Of the better items, the Barbeque sandwich that my husband ordered, and the Danny's Fettuccine Alfredo were the better choices.    The two year old had food from Mommy and Daddy's plates, just as well.  None of the food was hot, just  lukewarm.   After we finally received the bill, we noticed they left the root beer on the bill, even after we told them to remove it from the check.  I could see the server having a conversation with the manager, but he did not stop by or give us an apology.   If we go to another BJ's we will opt for another location.  Better option- somewhere else..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=400,2.92,2.97,3.08,2.6320000000000006,2.95

246,Angelica C.,"San Jose, CA",68,8,39.0,3.0,2013-09-28,"First, lets begin with location. Restaurant is at a mall which makes this place a good choice for dinner after a long day of shopping. There are other exceptional restaurants lined up as well next to BJ's.  Second, BJ's allows call ahead seating so I suggest to call because the wait is quite long on weekends.  Third, the waiters and hosts are all very friendly and charismatic. They made dining a pleasure.  Now, lets move on to the food. The calamari is perfect! I always get it. The Clam Chowder soup (with no bacon) is delicious. I wish I had more. It's creamy and the chunky contents such as the potatoes and clams are cut in small pieces and aren't too big to eat. You'll be taking big spoonfuls for every bite once you get it.  Presentation isn't impressive but the taste of each dish is satisfying. I ordered the Alaskan Salmon. The plate is a light dish with perfectly sized Salmon covered in a light white sauce, a tasty rice with herbs, and vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and cucumbers.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp gumbo. This plate doesn't look big when it's first presented, but it's actually quite a lot. It's a heavy dish so if you have a small stomach, you'll get full quick.  And obviously, the pizookie. This amazing little circle of a cookie has different flavors like Chocolate Chip, Cookies and Cream, and Red Velvet. If you're an Oreo lover, you'll love Cookies and Cream. In addition to the Oreo cookie and vanilla ice cream, it's topped with a whipped cream that appears to be mixed with very little crumbs of Oreo that compliments the pizookie nicely. If you're in a table with 3-4, I suggest to get the pizookie trio platter and just share. With an appetizer, main dish, and drink, you may already be full before the dessert comes out. But even if you are full, it's a MUST to eat a pizookie at BJ's so make sure you save room for dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=240,3.08,3.02,3.088,2.604,3.0440000000000005
378,Kimberly A.,"San Antonio, TX",42,333,311.0,2.0,2013-10-01,"My boyfriend and I occasionally come here when in the mood for American food, & when we need to eat late & are trying to avoid food out of a window. I love how BJ's is open until at least midnight. However, when you are tired and hungry and it is late, the last thing you want is BAD SERVICE!  Seriously, 85% of the time we come here, it is a much longer, more stressful meal than necessary because service is rude, slow, forgetful, incorrect, etc. I have been brought the wrong food, charged the wrong amount on the bill, my food has been forgotten, my drinks have been forgotten, us as a table were forgotten... I have even had to get up & go in search of a manager to get our bill to pay, & express our disappointment at the experience.  Why do we still return? Well, we haven't come in a long time. We just don't have the patience & our repeated poor service experiences have really dampened their company reputation with us.  I think the prices are high for what you get for most items. I have a couple usuals. I always get the small plate tomato & mozzarella salad, with is caprese-style, & has a delicious balsamic reduction along with fresh onions for crunch. I also get the vegetable stuffed potato, which is simple but hearty. Other than that I have been disappointed by the quality and ingredients of their salads, and did not find their pizza tasty. We come if I want a potato, but otherwise, they really need to work on introducing some healthy, vegetarian options! And of course, the customer service! One thing I do like, is that you can call ahead to put your name in.

510,Michael B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,29,,1.0,2013-10-05,"Last night was an absolutely terrible experience at BJ's. It was date night with my daughter and we were looking forward to spending time together having dinner and shopping at the mall. I have been to several BJ's, the one near Apple Computer in Cupertino and the one in Sacramento which were both GREAT and was looking forward to my dinner at Oakridge. Instead, the entire experience from start to finish was terrible.  When we arrived the front counter informed us the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Being told that the buzzer would not reach past the Mac store inside the mall we were stuck hanging around in front of the restaurant. Finally, after 58 minutes we were seated. During our wait we continually checked with the front counter for updates and their response was always the same....two more parties in front of you and it will only be another 3-5 minutes....clearly, the folks working the reservation system did not know what they were doing. Once seated we were excited to eat. Unfortunately, it wasn't for another 15 minutes that the waitress actually came to our table. On multiple occasions she stopped by to say she would be right back to take our order but never actually did. Finally, after the long wait she took our order...and then the long wait began. In fairness to the wait staff, my daughters soup and salad came within a reasonable amount of time but, unfortunately, her tomato bisque soup was stone cold. Sending it back we waited another 5 minutes before it was heated so I asked my daughter to start her meal while I waited for my fried chicken to arrive....and I waited and I waited and I waited.... 20 minutes later my chicken arrived. My heart sank when I looked at the entrée as the dish wasn't really fried chicken but a chicken fried steak. To make things worse the presentation looked like the chicken had fallen out of the sky into a cornfield sending the corn kernel out of the husk and splattering them all over my dish. It was hideous.  By this point I was thoroughly disgusted and asked to see the manager. 5 minutes later I spoke with him...he was nice enough...and I explained my problem. His response was that he asked me to forgive the terrible experience as everyone in the restaurant was new and getting trained. He said he had been brought over from the Infinite Circle BJ's to straighten things out but that he knew they were having problems. In a kind gesture he comped the cost of my meal....6.95...but by then the night had been lost. By the time it was over...well after 10:00... the mall stores had closed and I lost my chance to finish the date with my daughter. We left for Starbuck's and a Frappuccino which is always done right and then came home. Do yourself a favor....stay away from the Oakridge BJ's as you will be very disappointed. Their other locations are always spot on and I'm sure this one will be as well.....but like my wait outside....it will take a lot longer than they will tell you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=560,2.84,3.02,3.096,2.34,2.9480000000000004

But when BF and I saw their commercial for the current special, we went in- soup or salad, a medium pizza, AND a pizookie for $20? Not bad at all! Went in and there was a considerable wait due to the football crowd. Should have arrived sooner instead of at half time, oh well. Wandered the mall while we waited, then were seated and got a great server- unfortunately I can't remember his name.  Due to the good deal on the special, we felt comfortable ordering their seasonal pumpkin ale (which was AWESOME- not too sweet, not too pumpkiny, nice spice to it) and an appetizer of the chicken wontons. Unfortunately, the won tons order was not put in. By the time our server realized it, our pizza was out. Oops. We went ahead and cancelled it- we already had more than enough food and at that point, the purpose of an appetizer was moot. Started with the wedge salad with bleu cheese- love that salad, order it everywhere. Here, it's quite plentiful and the bacon is nice and crisp without crumbling apart. Very nice! Got the deep dish style pizza, half the Classic Combo and half the Favorite. Both were good, but I preferred the Combo- the veggies on the Favorite were not chopped very well and were quite large and undercooked. Not bad, but not my favorite, personally.  For the pizookie, we couldn't decide on a flavor so we had our waiter pick- got the macadamia nut white chocolate chip. Yum. Unfortunately this particular pizookie was very thin and overcooked- more than half of the cookie seemed to stick to the pan. Oh well, we really didn't need the extra calories.  Service was fine, especially considering the crowd and wait time. Server was polite and personable, and I tipped accordingly- with the deal and our beers, our order was a little over $30, without the deal it would have been closer to $45.  Will return to this location if in the area again while the special is still going, but it's not the closest one to me and their regular pricing does not appeal to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=420,3.2,3.03,3.112,2.444,3.098

Their process is a total mess, waiters take your order and you do not see them until they drop off the check. Your food is delivered by groups of different people that drop and run. I asked to speak to the manager, the waitress spoke to him and he never came by. He was on the phone the whole time, not a good thing for a manager! We will not be going here again.

Most of the time we avoid the restaurant altogether because of the stupid mall parking setup, but we do come occasionally. We usually just order the flatbread pizzas, being vegetarian, and things are ok. Avocado eggrolls are hit or miss between flavorful and bland. 3 star ratings. My last two visits however were not so great. I ordered a calzone and the waiter seemed a bit confused by my 'topping choices' and asked if I was vegetarian, to which I said yes. The food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, which the waiter apologized for.  And then I found multiple whole pepperoni slices in my calzone. Ugh. Waiter was apologetic and took it off the bill, offered to have it remade or a free dessert etc, but I didn't want to wait any longer than the two hours we'd already been there and declined. The more recent visit, we were seated in inside. The host sounded like he was reading a script. Eventually our waiter came over and took our drink/appetizer order..but not our meal order even though we were ready. He repeated that I said I wanted honey mustard on my salad. Eventually, I'm brought a salad with....ranch. Ok, don't really care so we ate it anyway. Main course seemed to take a while. Dining partner asked for a side of pesto with his flatbread and it didn't come, so we had to ask again. At some point later, he asked for a second order since the first cup was small. We never did get that one. It was also cold in there. Being cold outside, the coat I had with me was too bulky to wear at the table, so I just had to be uncomfortable the whole time. Meh.

464,Tako B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,34,1.0,2.0,2013-10-30,"This place is a hit or miss. Mostly miss though. I always make the mistake by coming here to eat instead of grabbing a beer to watch a game.  On game days it's packed and often the service is lousy. The wait can last for 30 - an hour on busy nights. I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory if its busy then. The food is tastier and less salty than at Cheesecake Factory.  The problem with service is that you are often neglected. I've had a few waitresses end their shift in the middle of my meal without telling me. I have to flag down either the manager or another server to pay my bill.  Sometimes I go to the bar because the wait is too long but service there is the worst. When it gets busy sometimes you have to fight for your table which is exhausting and infuriating. And even when you get that table you dont even know if someone will come to serve you.  Last time I sat at the bar for a solid 20 minutes without getting any menus or any acknowledgement that I am there. And I'm sitting right in front of the bartender. He rather sell drinks than tell me to wait a few minutes. It was a pretty bad experience getting ignored like that especially when there were 2 bartenders. I got up and left and went to Cheesecake Factory where the service is a lot better.  Down to the food. If you look at the menu most of the entrees are 1400+ calories which is pretty steep. Cheesecake Factory is worse but this is pretty bad. Even the healthiest salad is 700 cal. But the food is good here and the beer selection is good so go early when it isn't as busy. if youre going healthy the ahi tuna salad is good. If you would like something more caloric then the piranha pale ale nachos, piranha pale ale burger are good. I also like the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. The other dishes are good too. I would avoid the pulled pork sandwich too salty for my taste. I tend to think their pizzas are way too dry. But a lot of people still get them.

We came here last Sunday and we expected a wait. It gets really busy here on weekends. We were given a buzzer and sat on the benches right outside the door. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but after 25 minutes and watching people come after us and be seated before, we approached the counter and we were told that they called us already. I told them that the buzzer didn't go off. They said that they had been having trouble with them lately and that it's best for us to stay closeby so we can hear them call our name. She assumed we wandered off. There were probably 6 people sitting on the benches and there is NO way we wouldn't have noticed the door opening and our names being called. They didn't bother calling for us outside. So we get seated and it takes forever for our server to approach and ask about drinks, we were ready to order by then. We get our drinks and wait. Our salads are brought to us at the same time as our meal. I hate that, like I'm going to eat a salad while my dinner gets cold or something. So we decided to give them a second chance today. It's a Monday, not busy, service should be good. We get seated right away and our server comes up quickly. My drink is brought to the table and the glass is dirty with chunks of food stuck to the outside.  Our salad and soup STILL come at the same time as the food.

594,Shabnam J.,"San Jose, CA",420,56,9.0,1.0,2013-12-31,"This place is a joke. When it first opened the food actually wasn't bad and I absolutely loved their deep dish pizzas. However, the quality has gone downhill the past couple of years. I went there last night to celebrate my brother's birthday with my family (his choice) and it honestly was a horrible dining experience. To start, the waiter took ages to take our order. But whatever, I let that go. Our appetizers come out which were fine, but with no plates. Umm how exactly are we supposed to eat the food without a plate? I'd rather not use the table as my own personal plate, thank you. Once the plates finally did come out (appetizers definitely weren't hot anymore) the waiter had to make 3 different trips because the plates he brought were dirty each time. What are the chances that 3 different trips result in dirty plates?? Can we say UNSANITARY?!? And to add to that he kept trying to clean them by scratching off the leftover food with his finger...god knows what they do in the back when the customer isn't looking. Once we finished our appetizers my mom's dinner (soup and salad) came out 10min before everyone else's food and she obviously waited for our dinner to come out so she had to send her soup back since it was cold now...who would've thought (no apologies either from the staff). Finally our food comes out (took much longer than any other restaurant that I've been to) and of course my plate is wrong. I had asked for the spaghetti with grilled chicken and add basil. Instead I get a regular spaghetti plate and another plate with the grilled chicken pasta and no basil to be found. Why in the world would I order 2 pasta dishes???? And to top that off, the waiter had came back to the table to confirm my order with me after he entered it into the system. Honestly how difficult is it to get an order right? Staff as a whole needs some major re-training. AND when the bus boy was giving us our dinner plates, he completely knocked over my mom's ice cold water glass all over her with one of the plates in his hand and he acted so cavalier about it that I was in complete awe. He pretty much acted like it was her fault for having her glass there. Hello, it's your job to learn how to put plates down without knocking things over! If you can't handle it, then bring out less plates at once rather than 5 large ones. I finally ended up getting my corrected plate and the quality was whatever. Chicken was good, but sauce tasted like it was from a can. We got the check at the end and of course the two pasta dishes were still on there. You would think the waiter would've gone in and corrected that. Complete lack of attention.  All in all, I'm never going back even if it's somebody else's choice. There is no point, especially since Cheesecake Factory is right there and their food is always good and service is much better. They also have a ""Skinny Menu"" that actually tastes good unlike BJ's low calorie menu. I've given this place way too many chances and have been disappointed every time the past 3 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500,2.8,2.92,3.076,2.372,2.872

Good selections available. - 1/2 off Wine on Tuesdays. - Good variety of items priced at $4, $5 and $6 during Happy Hour. - Great bar seating with booths, high table tops and a very long bar facing their huge tv screen.

Now, I'm sure you've all been to a BJ's just as you've all been to a Chili's (or three other huge chain burger joints I can't think of right now), and you know that it's a slight cut above that genre of restaurants. The appetizers are more impressive than their entrees and, for a chain that serves chips and salsa, I really do like their chips and salsa the best. I'd say an average BJ's is 4-star worthy and that's taking into account menu diversity, quality of their food, atmosphere and overall satisfaction. However, this location is one of my least favorites due to their wait staff. The staff is always miserable (besides Justine). From simply their attentiveness for each table to their overall (un)cheerfulness, it's really bothersome to feel so.. Well... Bothersome to a waiter/waitress when you'd just like to enjoy a meal out.

Kudos to BJ's for putting the caloric values next to each entree on the menu but now my life has been shattered realizing how, when you combine meat, cheese, batter, and deep frying, you get an entire day's worth of calories! I've been to BJs about 5 times and each time the food that I ordered was pretty good. Most recently I've had the roast beef french dip but opted to not have the cheese to save a few calories.  It was pretty good.  I'd say it's a 7 in an array of french dips that range from cheap, dried, and tasteless with canned gravy as ""au jus"" (your average pub or chain restaurant)  to tender and succulent (Los Altos Grill - which I routinely use as my high-end benchmark).  The meat was good, the bread not too doughy or overpowering and and jus was good (not too salty or fatty).   I don't get the beers at BJs (I'm sure they're good to most people) because after I had their sampler I pretty much verified that I only like light wheats or black stouts.  In between there are too many funky flavors between ambers, pale ales (most IPAs are too hoppy which too me tastes like boiled socks in dishwater), and reds. BJs is a good, consistent, brewhouse with good food and a lot of selection and great waitstaff (both the Cupertino and Oakridge locations have great servers!).

My friends and I wanted Pizookies only, so we ordered two of them. I handed him my menu and he just forcefully grabbed it from me (talk about rude). After we received our pizookies he handed us our bill right away (we didn't even ask for it). I opened it and encountered a smiley face with a forced ""Thank You"" on it.

""Oh so do youuuuuuu, did you just cut your hair?!? WHO DID YOUR NAILS?!! WHOOOO""  Just kidding, that was a little bit over the line. If he thought we weren't going to tip, he was completely wrong.

Today it was a boneless wings appetizer. From a choice of several glazes/sauces, I selected the sweet honey/Teriyaki glaze, because ALL of the other choices were described as hot or spicy. When this appetizer came, there were so many red pepper flakes in the glaze that it was inedible.  I understand why bars serve hot spicy food -- it helps them sell more beer. (It's the same reason that popcorn at the ball park is too salty -- it helps them sell more beer.) And while I don't like spicy foods, any restaurant is free to serve all the hot, spicy dishes they want to. But when I order something that's listed as a ""sweet honey Teriyaki"" glaze, and its principal characteristic is that it burns the hell out of my mouth., that is not acceptable.  I guess no matter how much I like the concept and the atmosphere, I just have to resign myself to the fact that if I ever go back to BJ's again, either this location or any other location, I'll just end up mad at myself for being so gullible.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 6pm and found out their happy hour was still going on. We decided to seat ourselves in the bar area and shortly after, we were greeted by our lovely waitress. If I could recall correctly, I had asked the waitress the different types of dressings that came with the salads and in return I got my options with some attitude. My boyfriend and I then ordered our two appetizers, a pizza, dessert, and drinks. One of our appetizers came out super quick so we were certainly happy with that. The pizza came out second and we were both curious as to where our second appetizers went? We immediately flagged down our waitress and she told us that she completely forgot to place the order. We also told her that we didn't get our water or beer yet. She apologized and vanished. After minutes and minutes, she was nowhere to be found so we went ahead and flagged down a worker nearby to assist us.

I feel like the entrees are really hit or miss but the appetizers never seem to disappoint. The potato skins are a personal favorite of mine. Unlike most places, the potato skins are cooked to perfection. The outside is extra crispy even though the skins are cut thicker than most other places. It's also topped with bacon, green onions and sour cream. The Avocado Eggrolls are not a bad choice either. However, the sweet sauce that comes with it is a bit too sweet. Both these appetizers are super filling so I would recommend getting a smaller entree. Their deep dish pizzas are a personal favorite of mine, especially the Chicken and Bacon one. It's loaded with chicken and bacon (of course) along with green onions, tomatoes and a white creamy sauce. It is delicious with some red peppers sprinkled on top. I decided to try the traditional deep dish with sausages, bell pepper, tomatoes and onions. I must say, I was pretty disappointed. Some slices had no flavor and some slices were extremely salty. Not entirely sure what was going on with that. The one thing that really irked me was how slow the service was. My girlfriend and I spent two hours there but only 20 minutes of that were spent eating. The rest of the time was spent waiting for our waitress to take our order and bring our food. We waited a good 20 minutes before we could flag her down to bring us our check and another 15 minutes for them to charge my card. The service was terrible and the food was awful.

I'm still giving this place 5 stars because it's not their fault that this place is so good and everyone wants to come here! Yesterday I celebrated my son's 11th birthday there and had a party of 15. Because I'm so smart, I called right when they opened yesterday to make a reservation for 6:30pm. I was told reservations need manager's approval which was easy for them to get. I'm not sure if a manager's approval is always needed or it was just needed this week because of all the graduation dinners going on. For people that were just walking in the wait was one and half hours to two hours (which is the usual wait for this place but I think it was a little bit longer because of all the grad dinners going on). I got there 6:20pm and my table was ready on the dot by 6:30pm! Which is nice about this place when you have a reservation is that your whole party does not need to be there to be seated. We had a nice long table out on the patio setup. We had great and fast service the whole night. A huge plus was that all our food for dinner came out at once and all of the orders were correct (this is always a huge challenge when having a big party).  For dessert, everyone got pizookies! But before bringing everyone's pizookie out, they brought the birthday boy's out with a candle for us to sing happy birthday :) I would definitely come here again for when I have a big dinner party!

I didn't dig the angus beef dip sandwich either.  The beef felt all mushed up and the dipping sauce was too salty.  The skinny fries on the side, though, were decent.

Our server Corina came by and she seemed nice, took our orders and said she'd return with our drinks. Like 5 minutes go by and I start getting really thirsty wondering when my drink is coming, no big deal they finally come. Now again with the waiting game this time about 20 minutes go by until our food comes, way longer than usual but hey they might be busy....instant letdown as soon as the food hits the table. My bf ordered a chicken TORTILLA soup only to see no TORTILLA Strips, no avocado just plain chicken soup. Next, he ordered Wedge cut fries with his burger and guess what he got? THIN cut fries. Also I specifically asked for 3 sides of ranch before the food arrived, do you think it got delivered? No. At this point we both are very annoyed I mean after all its his birthday and they messed up only on his order! Seriously? He tells her everything that was wrong. She returns with the same soup he had already eaten some of and adds it to a bowl of tortilla strips & avocado. Is it not common sense to serve a fresh new soup since it was not done properly the first time..obviously not. Now it's refill time and that takes about 10 more minutes, I see our server walking around the ailes offering to refill everyone's waters. um hello where's our drinks you said you'd be back with 10 minutes ago? She gets to our table and says ""can I get you guys anything?"" Our drinks would be nice! Her response ""what drinks?"" Are you fucking serious right now! After telling her what we were drinking she said "" oh yeah that's my bad""and walks away................how much slower and forgetful can you be?!

The Manager comes over and apologizes as well and I just conveyed my feelings on how it would be nice to actually take my time on my appetizer before main course showed up.   We got our main courses and were happy with the food.  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the prawns over pasta.  Huge portions which neither of us could finish but all tasted fine.   The waitress comes over and hands us a gift card and vip 20% off card and apologized for the way the food came out.  We thanked her and continued to try to make a dent into our entree's.  About 15 minutes later, the manager comes back, reaches down on the table and grabs the Gift card and discount card that were in an envelope thing and tell us that ""this was not meant to be given to you, it was for another table"" and walks away.  Really really strange!  We told the waitress, she was mystified as well and told us she would get the manager back over, but at that point, i had had enough and told her not to worry about it.  We went on our way with dumbfounded looks on our face.   I can say, i will be back but will not make it a priority to go to BJ's with all the other options in the mall.  This Manager needs to learn how to deal with people a lot more professionally in my opinion.   The food remains consistent at BJ's, the management not so much!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=380,2.84,2.83,2.932,2.408,2.8339999999999996

Last night - I wanted nothing more than to leave. It was just two of us, the host had us seated immediately and advised us that our server would be by shortly. Okay, standard. 5 minutes, nothing. 10 minutes, nothing. A friendly server named Tasha walked by and asked if we'd have drink orders taken, and said she'd happily take them and send our server over. She returned a few minutes later with our drinks and asked if he came by, Nope. She was nice enough to take our orders. Since we sat down I had noticed a server being awfully chatty with two girls sitting in a corner booth, assuming he was off I didn't think anything of it at first. Until about 10 minutes after our food came out, and this guy came over and asked how our food was. Who the hell are you? Oh, dude in the corner IS our server. Nice.  Tasha kept coming over and checking on us and she was wonderful. Once we finished our meal, we sat patiently for someone to ask us if we wanted dessert or the check. 5 minutes..10...seriously? Again? And who was standing in the corner with the two girls at the booth, oh of course, our server. So we flagged down Tasha and politely asked for our bill, and also confirmed if the gentleman in the corner was our server, he was. We asked if she could be our server and have the check put in her name so the tip would go to her. Justyn D (our ""server"") - we were there for an hour, you came over for 2 seconds and we didn't know who the hell you were because you spent almost the entire time talking to the two girls in the corner booth.

I mean I'm a waitress too, I totally understand, but she has to be more mature and literally act more professional! Plus, our first waiter who supposedly said his shift was off BUT stayed there to hang out? I don't understand. If your shift is off shouldn't you leave? Not sit there, walk around, or hang out?  Also, for the check. It was super confusing and terrible! I had to personally come up to a different waiter to ask for change and LITERALLY they said they couldn't do it. They needed to find my waitress. Wait, did I forget to mention that whenever I held my hand up for service, NO ONE CAME?! They all just stared and pretended as if they didn't know anything.

If you want more sauce it comes with a side of extra sauce for dipping. The fries are hit and miss as sometimes they are perfectly hot and crispy and other times they are cold and soggy.  My other go to thing to order is the mahi mahi or shrimp tacos. It comes with two tacos for lunch and you can get the fish grilled or fried. You can get one of each or one fish one shrimp. They don't skimp on the shrimp so theres usually one in each bite.

I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to bring to attention the service these gents provided. I will come back when these 3 men are working. Thank you, Richard, Roddy, and Nereo. My friend and I had dinner to celebrate her birthday. I screwed up and didn't call 30 mins in advance like I was told to in order to have a shorter wait time upon arrival. The host(Richard) graciously helped me out and took care of everything despite the hassle I gave him(asking for ETA of a table for 2, thinking my friend would be late and giving up the table he'd given me, then sitting back down when she came on time). Props to him. Nereo was our server. He did the best he could what what he knew and had - I think he was a bit newer to the team. We weren't provided things that normally would be set already, but I understand he may be newer and looked a bit distressed. There was room for improvement for sure, but he courteously helped us out whenever we had requests. Our food was another story I wont' get into. Ordered 2 starters, and 2 entrees and had a couple things redone. It wasn't good and Nereo offered to ask the manager to speak with us. The manager(Roddy, I believe) was a nice man and asked us how our meal was, etc. He said he'd take care of it and ended up paying for the whole thing. I nearly flipped out because my entree was OK and was very resistant to the idea - he wouldn't budge though. Stand up guy. That's the service you'd expect at Alexander's or at Forbes Mill. Since we couldn't pay for the meal, I tipped Nereo about half of the bill because I felt bad for being picky(normal). This review is for the service alone, as I was a bit taken aback by the food(room temp and soggy calamari, bland&dry scampi pasta). My friend, the Bday girl is actually a really decent cook so we were saddened when the food didn't meet our standards or the other times we had frequented BJ's. Luckily, my friend's Pizookie didn't have sausage in it like a previous reviewer experienced.  All things said and done, we had a good experience and I would give this place 4 stars on service alone.

I was sitting closest to the bathroom and could hear a negative encounter between one of management and a server and to hear management speak to their employees in such a manor is not something I would expect from this establishment. It was simply out of line. Other than having to hear that conversation the service was great. And the food very good.

612,Maxim L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,6,,4.0,2015-04-25,"I had a great dining experience at this restaurant. It is a sports bar so it is loud and the wait times to be seated can be long in peak hours. But think about it: sports bars are loud and it is GOOD that the wait times are long, the wait times prove not only that the food is of good quality but also that people would wait just to eat here. That is actually a good thing. This means it is worth it. From my own view, this restaurant deserves a 4 star rating only because of the noise. I personally prefer restaurants a tad bit quieter but, again, I picked a sports bar which are generally louder than other restaurants. Otherwise, the experience was great. The decor was top notch, the food was delicious (by the way, you need to eat their pizookie), and our waiter was the best waiter I have literally ever had the pleasure of meeting. His name was Austin, and I believe he deserves a gold medal because the restaurant was horribly packed especially since it was a Friday night and he was still working with a smile on his face. He was kind and prompt with our order (especially mine because I was in a big rush). My food was ready and on the table in about 20 minutes. That's pretty good in my book. Plus, the taste is just WOW! Especially their burger and their pizookie. Seriously, try the pizookie. As you may have noticed I was impressed with the pizookie since I keep mentioning it. Try this place! But I wouldn't suggest it for romantic dinners, too much noise. If you are with a group of friends however? Oh yeah, go full out!

176,Veronica B.,"San Jose, CA",2,31,1.0,2.0,2015-05-14,"I'm done with this place. I usually drive to this BJs over the one that's closest to my house because I usually get excellent service here...whoops.  My boyfriend and I usually come to BJs late at night on weekdays because I work late. So there's no wait to be seated, we take a seat in the bar as usual. It was a Tuesday a little before nine. First, it took 15 minutes for someone to bring us menus. A server walked past several times without even looking at us. When we finally got our menu, I ordered wine quickly (the only good part of the meal, because it was half-off) and my boyfriend wanted a minute to look at the beer selection.  He asks for a minute, she's back ten minutes later with my wine. He orders a Belgian from their craft brew section, only for our waitress to tell us that BJs is discontinuing their craft selection and they didn't have what he wanted. In fact, she showed us a picture of the beer fridge to show what they had left, which is just sloppy. Why would you put a menu down in front of a customer that is so inaccurate and then get huffy when they need time to pick something else? After delivering that bad news, our waitress just stood there and didn't even try to suggest him anything else, so he said he'd need another minute but we at least got to order our food. Here's where it gets weird. It took her FOREVER to come back and take his drink order again. Like, he tried subtle eye contact, small hand gestures, and she just seemed determined to blow right past us. (And we both used to wait tables, so we're not unrealistic like some other customers.) He finally resorted to shouting at her back, which she still didn't notice. He got to order a beer at 9:30 (I was already done with my wine), and it came with our food, which brings me to my next point.  We'd ordered a pizza and a salad with the dressing on the side. It showed up around 9:45. The dressing was not on the side, and when the waitress asked if I wanted her to take it back, I straight-up told her that I wasn't willing to let that salad leave my sight because I was sure I'd never see it again.  So now she knows we're pissed, and decided to try and make up for it by checking in on us every minute after that which was just so annoying at that point. We seriously considered just asking for boxes when the pizza came so we could just eat at home, but we were hungry. My boyfriend complained, but the manager guy didn't say anything, just that he was sorry we didn't enjoy ourselves, then he turned around and left.  So the boyfriend and I will be patronizing Flames downtown from now on. I'd rather eat less good food in a louder, less adult atmosphere because at least I always leave there in a better mood than I arrived in. This experience was just bad, and the worst part was that if the service had taken longer, we at least could have gotten happy hour prices on our food. As it was, it was a 50 dollar tab for a lot of nothing and I'm not giving them any more of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=180,3.44,2.93,2.916,2.408,3.1340000000000003
202,Maricella G.,"San Jose, CA",11,11,5.0,1.0,2015-05-18,"Usually when I come here I get pretty good service....well depending what time it is and what servers are there. The last time I went in my girlfriend stood in front waiting for someone to come ask us how many to be seated for about 10min (we were the only ones standing there) finally a guy who was standing on the other side starring at the booths closest to the bar comes over and sits us and lets us know out waiter will be over soon. So we sit down and behind us is a group of 3 which we noticed the waiter (who ends up being ours) is walking back and forth to their table conversating with them and what not. He finally decides to come over to our table and take our order... now with my girlfriends plate she asked for mashed potatoes instead of rice and asparagus instead of broccoli. I had a feeling he wasnt even listening because he was so concerned with the table behind us.  Sure enough when our food came out there was broccoli instead of asparagus. Not to mention we're sitting there for about 15min with no silverware. We then noticed that  of the guys who clean thr table's was actually friends with the table behind us. Just to clear up our waiter and other guy, the other guy was philipino or asian im not sure and our waiter was a very tall whitr guy who knees down when taking our order. Both young. So the asian guy takes New silverware to the table behind us and starts talking to them and my girlfriend hears them tell him ""no we dont need silverware "" so our waiter 15min later realizes we dont have anything to eat our food with and go gets silverware. We then tell him we didn't want broccoli but asparagus. So he goes to the back puts in the order then comes back when we're half way done with our meal. (But not to mention he was back and forth ""checking"" on his co-workers, friends table just ignoring ours)  We finish eating and again like the whole night we hear him behind us talking to his co-workers friends and telling them ""I'll get you one of each of the pizokis (i believe their called) and comp it.... it's all of ur bdays today""  He comes to our table ohhh some time later takes our dessert order then leaves. He later passes by our booth and takes the table their dessert. They then leave and are all by the walk way to the bar saying by hugging etc.  He then comes to our table like 10min later and says ""we're remaking ur pizoki because the cook burned it"" we finally get it finish get our check and notice that he charged us for the asparagus  even though it was his mistake and we didn't eat the broccoli. We were so irritated and mad that we didnt even feel like arguing over some damn asparagus. So how nice we get terrible customer service, amd charged extra for something that was suppose to substitute something else. But bravo to him for looking out for his friends behind us and giving them all free dessert because he's ganna pretend its all their birthday.

Our waiter was okay but didn't give us silverware, we had to ask for it, and only gave it to one of us. He didn't ask if we were enjoying our food. He brought things pretty quickly including the check (which was a good thing). A man started cleaning the floor with a broom (our two babies threw a decent amount on the floor but it wasn't a huge mess), before we even had gotten up to leave or started to leave.

She went ahead and told her manager who showed up and seemed more confused than anything else. I don't know how she manages the place.

Showed her ham and bacon on the pizza but she believed that I made a mistake while ordering, so she went to grab the menu to prove me wrong but I was right.

What was totally lacking was communication and service.  I had signed a contract specifying the meal (it was provided by a BJ's manager, not by me) but the night of the dinner, BJ's didn't know what I had ordered.  Fortunately, I had a copy of the contract to show them.  It didn't make the order right (since the chicken came as a single portion--hard to serve 25 people from a single portion)--but BJ's did correct it finally.   Getting sodas, water and coffee was slow and problematic.  As was anything that required a request (like a plate).   As bad, although not all BJ's fault, was sitting outside.  It was warm enough on a cold night but the wind blew the plastic curtains around and the weights holding them banged against the walls so the place sounded like garbage can lids were rolling around.  I'd suggest considering other venues for large groups (the only place this BJ's has for large groups is outside) in bad weather or when the wind is blowing.  When the wind died down, the outside area was pleasant enough.

For the first time we got a server who was friendly and very attentive. Our drink orders were taken immediately. Hefeweizen for the boyfriend and orange cream soda for myself (with refills). I highly suggest it! Next time I want to try their new soda cocktails. Ordered the calamari (had to give it a second chance) for an appetizer. Again it was a disappointment being drenched in SO much oil. If you don't mind oil dripping off your fingers and face - I guess it was a decent dish. I, however, did NOT think so.  Boyfriend got the brisket bacon burger (I know, I know - heart attack in between buns). Came with choice of fries or potato wedges. I'm surprised they didn't offer a cold slaw side dish. Burger was good. The brisket was absolutely delicious. Apparently the kitchen misread the ticket and gave away my jumbo spaghetti and meatballs to someone at the bar, while I got a shrimp pasta... Sent it back of course. Took another 15 minutes before I got my meal and by then my boyfriend had long finished his. The meatballs were definitely jumbo and I did enjoy them. But the sauce was too runny and the worse part was how extremely spicy it was!!! After a few bites I just couldn't take it anymore and it became inedible. Taking a closer look I realized there were handfuls of dried pepper flakes. I don't remember it saying anything about being spicy in the description of this dish... Highlight of this meal was our server who constantly came to check in on us and refill our drinks. Too done with the meal to even go for dessert sadly...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=40,2.2,2.79,2.812,2.404,2.5540000000000003

I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Pretty good with eggs and bacon. I also had to have coffee as it is a very cold day.  Too cold for late December here in the Silicon Valley.  Good coffee. Yes, not kidding. The service is the only thing that is a hit or miss.  The waitress provides good service one minute and not so good the next minute.  Took a little too long to bring me a refill on coffee.

On Sunday, my family and I decided to go again. First, we came in and asked for a booth of 4, according to the employees, the wait was going to be 40 minutes! They were some people waiting, and as we were waiting, their was about 1-3 booths unseated, which was really annoying. After about 15-20 minutes, we got our table.  Although I love the food, the service can be good (not great or bad) to not good at all. This time, service was good. I had the ""baked ziti"" and it was absolutely delicious! Additionally, since a football game was occuring while we entered, the place was quite loud. Pros: - Fantastic Food - Pleasant atmosphere - Good beers (I have never consumed and alcohol  in my life, but people say the beer is good) - Lots of TV's! Cons: - Can be noisy at times - Service can be absolutely horrible at times - Long wait Overall, this place is good for large groups and/or for people who want to hang out at the bar and watch a game.

424,Mr. S.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,3.0,3.0,2016-01-11,"I don't know why people love this place so much. Honestly I think it's overhyped. Every time my friends or family drag me to this place, it's always a let down. The atmosphere and service is great though, so that's what pushed my rating from 2 up to 3. Starting with the food, it's all boring. Nothing special about their deep dish pizza. It's just like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. Super thick bread with cheese and toppings. Chicago-style would be so much better. The veggie burgers are average, and you can find better ones elsewhere. The thin and crispy fries were good. The tomato bisque soup was also good, though the sourdough bread bowl was bland and not sour at all. I liked the artichoke dip, though they only give a small amount for the price. And they got rid of the colored chips for plain white chips. The worst experience was with the beers. First, I appreciate that they have the 4 5oz taster flight option. This allowed me to taste 4 shit beers instead of just 1. I wanted their house porter and stout, as well as Santa Clara Valley Brewing's IPA and Red Ale. They were out of the red, so they gave me their house red. SCVB's IPA was pretty average for IPAs really, and that was the high point for the flight. Each house beer was terrible though. For one, I think both the stout and porter were on Nitro, since the beer was flat and the foam had fine, tiny bubbles, and I didn't notice that anywhere on the menu. I didn't like the nitro. In the end, I just got a 5th taster of Goose Island, which tasted great and washed away the taste of the bad ones that preceded it. On the way out, I saw they had Grand Cru, which I would have loved to try, but wasn't anywhere on the menu, nor on the drinks menu, nor on the little signs on the tables, so I didn't have the chance to order it sadly. I don't think I'd ever come back here for food. The atmosphere is pretty cool for hanging out with friends though, so I might be swayed on those grounds alone. Of course, there's plenty of other places in SJ to hang out too. No split checks, but they'll accept up to 5 cards if you do the math.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=440,2.52,2.76,2.84,2.38,2.664

All items were a disappointment. The driver took the initiative to call and let me know he was still waiting almost an hour after I placed the order, so when the food arrived it was lukewarm  (not the driver's fault).  My turkey burger was clearly a processed/frozen frisbee pattie with no flavor as opposed to fresh ground turkey meat, and appeared just literally thrown together. My husband's beef burger was dry and cooked well done despite ordering medium. The brussel sprouts were the biggest disappoint, as I was looking forward to them since having them once before. The  brussel sprouts were burnt black and completely inedible (see pic). Like, why would they even plate those?! I can't say I'd never come here again because they have great beer, and decent food as far as dining in.

I told the hostess it was 3 adults and a child and they still managed to sit me at a table were the was no room for a high chair for my 1 year old I told the hostess this she just smirked and ignored me! The next hour and a half we would wait for food in the meanwhile my daughter could not sit still and banged her head on the table, I should of known better and asked again but I didn't want to be rude!! The reason we chose the place was b/c I wanted to try their pita tacos which I did not enjoy due to the Greek yogurt (my fault) anyway my husbands ribs and fries were pretty amazing and so was their P'zookie and the drinks. The waitress who I shall not name was really nice and went out of her way to please us always smiling though the place had calmed down after the basketball game ended. Once the check came around we owed $93.06 and I was debating on whether to leave a tip or not, we decided $5 will suffice for the waitress who even wrote Thank you! On our receipt. Well last night I noticed my final amount had posted on my bank and the total was $108.06 woah woah woah since when in $5 + $93.06= $108.06?????? Like did I miss something?? Anyway I contacted a manager last night he said he would follow up and he didn't so I called again today and spoke to another manager SHE CONFIRMED that my check had been altered!!! The tip went from $5 to $15!! The manager was friendly and I appreciate that but all she said was sorry???? Reallyyy?? Whomever altered took $10 without my consent and I'll I get is a sorry oh and of course a refund for my $10 I never authorized to be taken from my account? Where's the ownership? Where is the guarantee that it won't happen again to me or anyone else? I just don't understand? Is it my fault b/c I tipped so little?

287,Rami C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,2016-04-27,"Firstly I hardly Yelp but when I receive extremely poor service I definitely want other people to know to save their time and money. Me & my boyfriend went to have dinner here tonight & I can honestly say we had the worst service in the history of customer service. When your waiter is rude & purposely ignoring you even the food and drink start to taste bad. The whole time we were there we just wanted to leave but we were hungry & it was too late to go elsewhere. The server was the most meanest and rudest person I've ever encountered. He was arrogant and completely hated us because it was happy hour and we took up a big table as the lady at check in said we could sit anywhere in the happy hour section and we picked the round table that sits a group, we overheard him and the his server friend saying ""why would they take that table"", so unprofessional. Whenever we would order something he would just give us this horrid stare like he was mad at us not say anything and then walk away he would go check on other tables and skip ours and didn't even offer us water. It was such an awkward atmosphere because he was clearly talking about us to his other shift buddies and they'd all stare at us like it was high school and they were the bullies, he just didn't like us and I can't believe we stayed there and paid $80 for rubbish service. I loved BJs never will I go there again or advise anyone to go there especially this location. Worst experience everrrrrrr! Also the food was so bad, the avocado spring rolls looked like a mess on the plate and the mini pizzas were cold and the ingredients looked old and also tasted old and sour. My boyfriend took one bite and left his pizza. I'm sure the server told the chefs to purposely make our food bad. This was a complete waste of my time and money and I will never celebrate birthdays or have group functions here ever again also will tell everyone I know not to go here and will recommend anywhere else but this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=280,3.08,2.71,2.86,2.7560000000000002,2.8580000000000005
352,Melanie N.,"San Jose, CA",136,16,1.0,1.0,2016-04-28,"I wish I could give this restaurant less than one star. I met some friends to celebrate a birthday. (BJs wasn't my choice) Our first server disappeared for a long period of time (we were waiting for a 4th friend to show up and didn't want to order without her). Thankfully we got a new server, Miguel who was the ONLY thing positive about the visit.  1) Our beers were warm so we sent them back. My friend ordered a margarita without salt to replace the beer she sent back and it came with salt. 2) We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and ended up with a stale, mangled platter of ""bottom of the bag"" chip pieces. My friend asked the expo for ranch and he never returned with any. 3) My friends side salad was ordered and requested to be served before our entrees. It came out after our entrees. 4) Two of us ordered Mediterranean Pita Tacos without onions and they came with onions. We sent them back and the new batch still had pieces of onions. We saw a server (Patrick) and asked if he could take them back to the kitchen and he looked at us like we asked him to do something completely insane/ridiculous. I thought maybe it was his first day on the job but it turns out he's worked there for a long time and it wasn't ""his problem"" to deal with. The manager on duty didn't seem too apologetic when we requested him to our table. He was quick to offer a discount and didn't ever come back to check in on the end of our experience. Clearly, if we had this many mistakes with our table, there must be other parties with problems too. It seems like no one was willing to take accountability. It's safe to say I will never return. Not even for happy hour.  I feel for Miguel, who clearly holds himself to a high standard of customer service. The kitchen, management and other servers do not support the experience he tried very hard to provide us with. We tipped Miguel well but realize not all patrons will be as forgiving to Miguel's ""lack of support"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=260,3.0,2.7,2.86,2.8520000000000003,2.8200000000000003
185,Tammy L.,"San Jose, CA",57,20,35.0,3.0,2016-05-01,"It sucks that you can't make reservations unless it's a party of 8 or more. When I called over the phone, the worker told me that I was put on the list, however when I went to check in, he told me it was another 40 minutes.  Their texting system is pretty helpful and accurate. 40 minutes later, we were seated. We started off with calamari and when it arrived, it was such a let down!!!!! It was drowned in oil and abnormally soft, and chewy. We also ordered the traditional wings, because our waitress, Brittney, recommended it as her favorite. Their traditional wings came with celery and with both ranch and/or mild or super spicy sauce. You can pick either one. The mild sauce had an abnormally strong smell, but it tasted great!!! For the main meal, I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with a side of seasoned potato wedges (you can pick between this or crispy fries) and my girlfriend ordered the deep dish ziti. Honestly, the side of seasoned potato wedges didn't taste ""seasoned"". There was really no difference between the potato wedges and crispy fries. Overall, I really enjoyed my burger - mainly the BBQ sauce!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DONT MIND 1200 CALORIES. When I tried the deep dish ziti, it tasted like a pizza in pasta form. It's actually new to the menu, and well worth the price, if you're looking for something really cheesy. After the group finished all our meals, we ordered the monkey bread pizookie and salted caramel pizookie - the waitress put both of them on the house because it was my friend's birthday. The pizookies are definitely why people come here. After our meal, the waitress brought us our meal, and though they didn't incorporate tip into the price, their receipt does show the calculated 10% and 15% tip wages. No pressure, I guess.

My salad came.... 25 minutes later her chicken came.... No appetizers.. Then we were asked if everything was ok and I said well we never got out appetizers.. To which they said oh let's check on that and it came back out less than 5 minutes later... So... Now her chicken is getting cold while she try's to enjoy some of the appetizers. To top it all off while we were eating I ordered a pazooki to go and a half hour later after paying for our food and terrible service, after being told twice it was almost ready. and then waiting another 15 minutes and asking another server to check on it for me we finally got it and left..

All the waiters are super nice and very attentive to your wait time and what you need during your visit. The restaurant is kept very clean - I've never had any complaints about sticky tables, food on the ground, etc. like at other places. The food is always super good. I love coming here for their burgers and fries - if I have a craving this is the place to go! The pulled pork sandwich is very good and you know you'll always have to get their pazookies!

It was that good and I can't believe I haven't had a pizookie before. I'd come back just for that. Nonetheless, they are a restaurant and so there are other things to judge. This placed is packed on weekends and that really sucks but if going on a weekday most likely you'll be seated immediately which is nice. One really minor thing I saw and that I see noted in other reviews is that I felt like I was interrupting the front staff when we came in and I totally understand talking during down times as its normal in any job, but perhaps there can be a way to be both productive as well as socializing with co workers instead of just having a little circle with backs against the door.  I don't remember our waitress' name unfortunately but she was really attentive to our needs and always checking up on us as well as being enthusiastic even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant yet which is always a plus as having superb people skills regardless of it being busy or not is important.  For appetizers, Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Now let me say I dislike Brussel Sprouts normally and that summed up my first bite. I took a random one off the side and I didn't see any difference from a normal Brussel Sprout. Turns out the sauces on the bottom wasn't in the particular area that I took my Sprout from so I was missing out and just eating a plain Brussel Sprout. After noticing that, the Brussel Sprout in the actual Honey Sriracha sauce is actually pretty good without being too overwhelming or filling to prevent me from eating my entree. Now for entrees I mainly wasn't that impressed because I didn't really see anything special in my deep dish ziti. It was good no doubt about that and the garlic knot was an awesome add on as well but I wasn't just super into it.

Please take a few minutes to read about our experience.  We were greeted warmly upon arrival and told that there would be a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. Which is fine, we were willing to wait. A few seconds later, one of their employees stated that they had a table for 2 available, and we were escorted to the table. That was the only pleasant thing that happened during our meal.  Nobody ever came to our table. Not to say hello, not to say ""I'll be right with you"", NOBODY!!! After 15 minutes of being ignored, I flagged down a waiter who was walking by and asked for water and let him know we were ready to order. He stated that we weren't his area, but he would still take care of us. And he did. He took our orders and brought us water. During the meal, he stated that he was going to take his dinner break and introduced us to a new server. The original waiter stated that they'd take care of dessert for us for the long wait. Something we didn't ask for but accepted as a sign of good faith. Once we were done with dinner, we asked the replacement waiter for dessert. He said, ""Its on its way out. It should be out shortly."" More than 30 minutes went by and nothing came out. He nervously came back to our table to apologize for the wait and he would personally go see what was taking so long. They had forgot about our dessert. He came back to apologize again and at that point we just wanted to pay and leave. The mall was closing and we had to finish Christmas shopping. He took more than 15 minutes to bring out the dessert and our check. He knew that we had waited almost an hour for dessert and stated that his manager was going to come by and discuss our terrible experience.  THE MANAGER NEVER CAME TO OUR TABLE!!! That was the ultimate slap in the face. I wanted to speak with the manager to explain how awful our experience was. But since he never came, I couldn't. We also couldn't finish Christmas shopping because of how long we waited for a Pazooki and the manager. Needless to say, we left the restaurant very upset, did not tip a dime and wrote a note to the irresponsible manager on the receipt.  I will never return to BJs at Oakridge Mall.

This was a work party and we wanted to do spilt bills but the server said she asked us about that.  That's another lie.

We noticed that Paul took the energy and focus to put the take out orders in such a way that it could be enjoyed really well at the house too. He remembered our preferences with sauces and what not. If something was meant to be cold or frozen, he separated them from the hot foods.  Just really impressed. He has an attention to detail, works hard, and also shows he loves what he's doing. When the kids opened and ate the takeout, there was that sense of care from Paul. He didn't just serve us and throw us away after we gave the tip.

The next day I called again having not received a call back I was put on hold for 30 minutes so I just hung up called back 15 mins later finally got someone who knew what she was doing told me only managers can make reservations put me on hold and got a manager to help me. I spoke with the GM she was nice gave her my info and told her my frustrations she was really nice and apologized for the inconvenience. I arrived on 3/9 to find out they gave us a table outside had no other option because their booths only fit 7 hmm something they should have told me. Our waitress was amazing she deserves praise and a raise food was sub par but she really made up for my experience well so I thought. Yesterday 3/19 I receive a call from Bjs wanting to know if I am coming in for my reservation they had me down for I said no I already came 10 days ago I'm not sure why you have me down for today the girl apologized and hung up then about an hour later another one calls saying I have a reservation first of all do you guys not communicate because I've already spoken to someone second of all I already went to your establishment 10 days ago but it makes sense why they had me multiple times because these people do not have their stuff together. You would think they would want a party of 10 but I guess not I am so disappointed about the way I was treated. No sincere apology or anything as a manager myself in the hotel industry I strive on customer service and communication which this place is lacking.

I found the calamari pretty tender and the tartar sauce was yummy. I don't normally like tartar sauce. The rack of ribs was super dry, although adding more BBQ sauce made it taste better. It came with two sides, brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts were overdone and not crunchy. The mashed potatoes were creamy though.

102,Alex B.,"Oyster Point, CA",47,24,,2.0,2017-05-12,"I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes, it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar, I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes, but of course, there are shining exceptions.  The food is decent for the most part, with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times, and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard, but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas. While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller, contrarily, entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much, but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable. Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food, but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=40,3.4,3.59,3.22,3.0800000000000005,3.5140000000000002

My most recent few visits to this location have been satisfactory but, I had stared to notice that the bartenders here give preferential treatment to customers from what I overhear are employees at several surrounding restaurants. P.F. Changs, Bucca Di Beppo to name a few. Well It seems that my needs fall on the back end of those work nearby. I watched several bartenders (both Caucasian looking males) interact with said customers by giving out shooters and beers to them, while every time I asked for another beverage my receipt was immediately updated but it seemed that the local employees were getting freebee after freebee. Which to me doesn't look great when I feel that I spend enough money there not to be included in this generosity. Regardless the interaction with my bartender (Randy C.) was minimal and felt disingenuous. In short I didn't enjoy watching this happen and will recommend others avoid the bar top unless they work in the same field in the surrounding area.

This is to all the employees here, if you are one of the few that do treat their customers with respect and attention then you are one of the lucky few...To the rest, if the people here don't enjoy their job and feel as if every time a customer asks for something that they are being disrupted, please go and find a job in a place that allows you not to be customer facing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=20,3.08,3.37,3.3,,3.254

4,Ria A.,"San Jose, CA",435,68,382.0,3.0,2017-10-14,"This location is 1000 X better than the one on Coleman ave! If you prefer not to eat in a pitch dark restaurant, this location is it!  We've always gone to the BJ's located on Coleman avenue and did not even realize this was close by! Every time we've gone to the Coleman location to watch a game, I've felt as if I were seconds away from falling asleep! The place is so dark and made me feel instantly sleepy! Maybe I'm just weird..Anyway, if you like light, go to the Blossom Hill location.  This location also has a large parking structure next to it as it's right by the mall. Parking is never an issue and I love the out door seating area. As far as food and drinks go, it's typical bar/chain restaurant food. It's a great place to watch games and grab a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose,3.12,3.33,3.292,,3.246

19,David N.,"San Jose, CA",5,113,168.0,3.0,2017-10-19,"I gave up on their generic bar food shortly after the place opened a few years ago, but heard they revamped the menu and wanted a decent draft beer while at the mall for lunch so gave it another shot. The Hop Storm IPA was the best part of the meal. I had the lunch special BACON-GUACAMOLE DELUXE BURGER, for which I'll review the elements: Bun: Very good lightly toasted brioche-style bun. Chipotle mayo: Far too little of it squirted on the underside of the top bun. Guacamole: About 1/3 of it was dark and rotten. Applewood smoked bacon: Didn't taste any smoke flavor and it wasn't thicker than regular bacon as it should have been. It was also old and not hot enough, clearly having been made long before the burger. Red onions, tomatoes and jalapeños: They were under the burger, but too mushy and sparse as compared with the menu photo. Pepper jack cheese: Didn't see or taste any pepper - it just looked like monterey jack. It was also cold and not melted onto the burger at all. Burger: Decently seasoned and cooked medium as I asked, but it's definitely low quality beef. Not sure how to accurately describe its texture and mouth feel but chewy, dense and slightly sinewy come to mind. Also clearly smaller than the one pictured on the menu. Fries: Okay-tasting and crispy but barely warm and about half the amount pictured on the menu. Overall not a bad deal for $10 but I think the kitchen has execution, temperature, and material quality issues to address.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose,3.04,3.34,3.3,,3.2200000000000006

I got so upset, I asked the guy next to her and he was like ""hmmm... your name isn't on the list"" Wow I was on fire at that point.

It's currently 6:30pm and I am fuming simply because we made this reservation and my mother has diabetes, so she has to eat on time. Thank you BJs for celebrating her birthday by not actually serving us and leading her to have a hypoglycemic attack in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered a soda, which came 40 minutes late. I am very, very upset, and me and my family will never come back again. This dang place almost costed my moms life, and I have never experienced a worse experience. I sincerely hope BJs fixes it's terrible service, because I will sue next time I step foot in here. We also had no apology for the wait, and the servers were blatantly rude and terrible to us and I'm still in shock as to how all the servers were irresponsible. This place is horrible. Horrible.  I'd rather die than come back. Honestly. Not to mention the staff was extremely racist to my family, thinking that we could not comprehend the American language, and ignored all of our requests. Thank you once again, for the racist, horribly slow, and disrespectful service! I wouldn't even give this place a star, and I would give it a - 7 if possible. As for food, the brown rice is uncooked, cold, and very unappetizing. Everything is not even lukewarm because they didn't even have the decency to bring out food on time. (I also requested for this to be brought out as soon as possible seeing that my mother had very low blood sugar. This was brought out 30 minutes late. And we got cold food.

That's what happened to me and two friends this past Thursday. The manager sat us at a booth as soon as we asked for a table and said our server would be right with us...yeah, that didn't happen! Okay, I don't mind waiting a few minutes but to have no one come by to offer at least water or ask ""have you been helped"" after sitting for 10 mins is just not okay. Multiple employees passed by and no one cared to say a word. Not until we got up and were heading out.

So we were having a good time. But hen we realize that we were waiting for 45 min for our food. Then when the food came, some of the items (fries) were stale tasting. Then my sister had to wait a little longer for her plate while we all got ours. When her plate came the chicken was raw in the middle. The waitress we had was awesome, she came to us right when  we raised our hand for her attention. She didn't run the other direction. Once she took back the plate a few seconds later her manager came and apologized. He took it off our ticket and got her a different choice for the night.
