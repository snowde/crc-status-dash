Good tomato soup too.  The pizza has the best crust in my opinion of any place in the bay area. It's expensive, but worth it. I like they throw in tomatoes and garlic for free as toppings. It's a deep dish unless you order thin, so even a small pizza is the kind of meal you have to take home to finish by yourself, especially if you order an appetizer first.  I like the spaghetti & meatballs and the jambalaya too. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes they get pretty busy, so it's easy to understand.  If you're a hamburger or steak kinda guy, there are better options though.  Sometimes if they're super busy and you're waiting for you table, the hostesses bring out a small slice of cheese pizza for you to sample while you wait, and that's a nice touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=680,3.12,3.14,3.096,2.768,3.1320000000000006

I guess I was expecting the melt, stringy cheese, not the oily kind. I did taste the garlic but not chipotle as stated on the menu. The bacon bites were a good touch but the pasta did not have the crispy crust on the top as stated on the menu ""oven baked to crispy"". I think maybe the execution or ingredients were a little off? One of my coworkers had the caesar salad with grilled chicken. He orders this dish all the time. I can see why. The portion of the greens (not just ramaine lettus) is huge and there is generous portion of grilled chicken. Looks like a very simple yet satisfying dish. Hawaiian Mahi Mahi - fish portion is good (not huge), but flavor was lacking and very bland and a little on the dry side. The pineapple fried rice was also not impressive; a little oily and the rice was a bit hard. I prefer the rice to be soft and starchy instead of not cooked all the way through like this. Even though the menus says that it is under 600 calories I will not order this dish again! I just don't think healthier or lighter dishes need to taste so bland!

411,Sarah M.,"San Mateo, CA",13,16,2.0,3.0,2012-03-18,"I live about a five minute walk from this BJs. I didn't used to go here much, but since the recent demise of my ""only means of conveyance"", I have become something of a regular visitor, if only because it's the nearest bar to my house and it's easy to get to without a car.  I have mixed feelings about the place.   On the one hand, BJs is awesome - the lighting and atmosphere are maximum chill, the bar area has an above-average tv situation, their house beers are a pretty good deal at happy hour ($3/pint), and they serve some giant, triumphant nachos (nachos are my favorite) which are also a decent deal at happy hour.  Most of the non-nachos food is good, too.  My crew is particularly fond of the chicken-fried steak, the entree salads, and the (often overlooked) buffalo chicken wontons.   My FAVORITE thing about BJs is the service - BUT that's only because I always stick with my go-to server John.  John has always provided my friends and I with THE BEST customer service. I don't know about the rest of the employees, but if they are as polite, affable, and conscientious as John, then BJs is doing pretty well in a restaurant world often marred by servers that pay indifferent and/or sloppy attention to the experience of their patrons.   HOWEVER, dining at BJs is not entirely sunshine and happiness and being tickled about the groin with bluebird feathers.  It is often very crowded - there can be lines at any time, even on a weekday at 8:30pm. If you just want a burger and a beer and aren't down with waiting for a table, I'd recommend the Red Robin next door. Also, because the menu is so epic, none of the food is really THAT great.  You're not likely to get the best ""____"" you've ever had at BJs.  For the quality of the food, it's a little overpriced, especially outside of happy hour.  There are usually a lot of children there, so you will want to beware the crayon torpedoes, if you (like me) are not lookin' to tangle with these small creatures on your nights out. Anyway, I like to go to BJs for beer and snacks with my palz from time to time.  It's close by, nothing there has ever really sucked very much, and John is the best.  Ya heard?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=380,3.08,3.13,3.1,2.54,3.11

729,Brown D.,"Vallejo, CA",0,21,,2.0,2012-03-31,"I would rate this a one, yet I've been suprised on SOME visits to this establishment that I feel as if it was unfair if I didn't acknowledge those positive points. Things that were positive were the amount of choices given for delectable dishes, desserts, pizzas and appetizers as well as beers on tap. Negative points included occasional server/hostess attitude and rudeness. You would usually find staff members giving a sense of superiority since they work at a very busy establishment, yet I feel that if you wish to continue having statisfied cliente then a change should be made in the attitudes expressed to customers during their dining experience. Of course like I said I've had several servers surpised me from my past experiences so I have decided to reflect it in the score. I also would like to mention food quality since service to get your initial dish usually gives you enough time to probably plan out your week. Quality has been hit or miss as well yet I have found a few instances where I felt as if I had to visit the facility several times during my visit and normally when I go out to eat I don't tend to feel as if my food is racing to get in and out of my system at an expressed rate. Positive things I could include about this establishment are their selection of signature beers as well as their signature dessert the pazookie which I wish at times was a lot cheaper since the dessert itself seems so much easier to make than how its priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=700,3.08,3.12,3.088,2.568,3.1040000000000005

Just because 17% gratuity will automatically be calculated doesn't meant that we should get bad service. Our server was pretty much non-existent. We had to chase people down just to get our water refilled. A friend and I both got the Shrimp Scampi and when it came it was bland. Tasteless. We asked a server if we could get some more of the sauce for the pasta and he didn't get us any. We had to track down another server for that. And all we got was a small dish with tomato sauce.

They have a full bar and great selection of beer.

The Angel Hair Toscano was plentiful but tasteless but since it was so plentiful I was able to bring it to work the next day.

Their Margaritas and Strawberry Daiquiris are also tastily mine with Whip Cream but on the Pricey side at $9.95.   We noticed that none of the Cocktails had prices on em because they are pricey, but delicious and worth the splurge once in a while.

370,Caroline K.,"Hayward, CA",174,189,103.0,2.0,2012-06-02,"Came here for lunch not too long ago and sat at the bar since I was by myself, and there was an open spot.  Ordered a lunch special mini deep dish + side salad. The pizza was great, just like any other BJ's.  The crust is not as crispy as some deep dish pizzas, which can be good or bad depending on your taste.  I happen to like pretty much all kinds of pizza crusts, so I'm fine with either.  But in case you haven't been to a BJ's before, that's the scoop. The salad.  Ooookay, so my server listed the options for side salads and I decided to go with the special watermelon & feta.  It came, and boy was it gross.  I am normally very open to mixing sweet and salty but the feta and watermelon did not go well together.  Either that or the dressing was wrong or had gone bad, but something tasted yucky.  I tried to eat the components separately to minimize the mixing of watermelon + feta in weird dressing.  What happened here, taste-testers?? The service definitely could have been better.  Yes, I came at the end of a busy lunch rush, but it seemed like everything kind of took awhile.  I guess I was hoping for a quick lunch experience, but it's hard when there are like 200 tech people who work nearby also hoping for the same! Then, my server suggested I try a mini pizookie, so that I could have just a taste without the crazy huge serving of a normal sized one (which should be shared, for sure!).  So I picked the red velvet one, with white chocolate cream cheese chunks.  Sounded amazing.  I get my pizookie, however, and it is raw inside.  Like they had stuck it in the oven for 5 minutes to get a crust-looking top, pulled it out, and served it.  I couldn't find my server anywhere, so I sat there for several minutes waiting for her to come back.  When she checked on me, I told her it was raw.  She graciously brought another one with no complaints, but of course it had to cook for another 15 min or whatever.  So that added to my annoyance about how long everything was taking...not HER fault, but the kitchen's fault, really.  So anyway, I finally get the cooked one and it is good.  It's really ridiculously sweet though, maybe it was the chocolate chips, but geez.  It's hard to finish.  I think that's kinda true of all their pizookies though.  The mini size was great though, it was still even bigger than I'd expected.  And I didn't have to feel quite as guilty. ;) Anyway, it is not my favorite BJs.  They need to step it up quite a bit to rival most of the other BJs I've been to (La Jolla, Westwood, Laguna Beach, even Tanforan).  If you've never been to a BJs before, don't pick this one as your first stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=420,2.88,3.09,3.088,2.408,3.006

We wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by somebody and order a round of waters and a diet coke before we get to the good stuff.

While its list of desserts pales in comparison to its competitor with just as extensive a menu (if not more so), the food is comparable and the service tends to be better and more consistent. One of things I do notice when I go to these restaurants is how they take care of the kids in our party. Time and time again, TCF sends food out from the kitchen for the kids that is incredibly hot and on scalding plates. Every time we've been to BJs, they seem to be much more on top of the concept that the little ones shouldn't be given scalding food.  This trip I had the 8oz sirloin with a bowl of tortilla soup and one of their giant baked potatoes.  Everything was cooked right and tasted good. The wifey had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, a dish she regularly gets and enjoys. The boy got a Mac n Cheese appetizer which I tried and was quite good. Em, the 3 year old had chicken strips and fries off the kids menu that she thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course a trip to BJs isn't complete without their signature Pizooki, a freshly baked chocolate cookie topped with ice cream. Of course the boy jumped all over that while the little one decided on a kids Ice cream sundae.  Even though my meal totaled a whopping 850 calories, I chose to pass on desert.  Once again, props to BJs staff for being prompt, attentive, and cognizant of the nuances that accompany serving a family meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=400,3.0,3.08,3.084,2.836,3.0480000000000005

Perfect way to spend my Saturday. :) I was in the area today picking up some stuff, and decided to grab some food with my mom before heading back home. We passed by BJ's and I got a craving for their delicious stuffed mushrooms, so we parked and went inside.  We were seated quickly, and our server, Jessica, was friendly, fast, and efficient. For drinks, I had a Watermelon Mojito, which was amazing...strong yet sweet- just the way I like my drinks! My mom ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and it was also pretty good.  Jessica asked us if we knew what we wanted, and I told her that we knew we wanted the mushrooms, and my mom and I were just deciding on other appetizers to go with it. She was kind enough to suggest a mini portobello pizza, and we agreed it sounded awesome as well. We also got the crispy artichoke hearts, and a tomato mozzarella salad, which we've had before, and loved. Shoot that salad....is soo good. It's simple and delicious, and I do plan to re-create it in my own kitchen, I promise you this. ;)  We were able to watch the Giants game while we snacked on our food, which arrived in a timely matter. When we finished, I confessed to my mother that I still wanted more stuffed mushrooms- so we ordered another round to go, and brought it home to share with my Grandma, too, along with some of the leftovers, which weren't much, since everything was so yummy! I really liked that Jessica was friendly, but gave us our space, as well. It was also so nice to get suggestions on menu items. I love BJ's, but sometimes the menu can be intimidating if I haven't already tried something. I am so indesicive when it comes to food sometimes, it's nice to have someone tell me, ""Hey, you might like this..."" and make the decision for me, before I change my mind eight times.  If you come here, ask for Jessica.

519,Kasey R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,1.0,2012-07-13,"When I go to BJ's (which is not often), my expectations are not very high. It's a chain restaurant that is known better for its beer and big-screen televisions than its fresh and local food, and I understand that. However, I still expect to be treated with respect and to have my party's food and beverages get to us in a timely manner.  That said, my most recent experience at BJ's has confirmed I will never be returning, except hopefully to get a refund. The service was horrible from the start, our food was mediocre (even for BJ's standards), and when we brought this to the manager's attention after the meal (I do not recall his name, but he is the overweight asian man) he was extremely rude and unaccommodating. We will be contacting his manager as a result.  So, here are the specifics as to why I will not spend money at BJ's ever again: 1. POORLY EXECUTED FOOD (which mainly consisted of FRIED dishes)  The roast beef sandwich was fine, but my blonde shrimp had been left in the flyer too long and were mostly overdone, some being burnt. The potato wedges and fish were lukewarm and had clearly been sitting at the pass for far too long. By the time we actually got this food we had actually been at the restaurant for close to an hour and did not have the time to send anything back. 2. HORRIBLE SERVICE  My party was seated in the back of the restaurant, and after over 10 minutes had still not received a hello or any water from any waiter-- even though the people next to us who had been seated AFTER US were being attended to by a waitress. One of us finally had to get up and find that waitress (I do not know her name either, but she was a younger, overweight  girl with dark hair and bangs) to ask her if she could take our drink orders. She responded NOT by simply taking out orders, but by saying she ""wasn't sure"" if she was our waitress, but she would go check. So, there we waited some more. A few minutes later, she returned and curtly said she ""would just take our order because it will be easier that way."" By that point we were ready to order drinks and food, so we gave her our complete order, which consisted of the fried blonde shrimp, fish & chips, and a roast beef sandwich-- SIMPLE food. She proceeded to take about five minutes to get back to us with water. Our food took about another 15 minutes to arrive, despite her telling us she would ""rush our order.""  Throughout the meal she never once returned to fill our water glasses, so we had to flag down a busboy. When she did bring over my husband's Jeremiah Red beer, she just dropped on the table with no eye contact and turned to help the table next to us again. When we were finished eating and the waitress was around, we hailed to her and asked for the check, which took her over 5 minutes to bring to us. We put the card in it immediately, but still after 1 minutes she had not come back to pick it up. At one point I even made eye contact with her but she still did not come over. Finally, we just decided to pay in cash and not wait for the receipt. 3. RUDE MANAGER After the meal, we went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. We waited almost 10 minutes and still he did not show. We almost left without speaking to him, but decided it was worth it to wait. So we waited another 6 or so minutes and he finally showed. He did not apologize for keeping us waiting. After we explained the horrible service and ridiculous mistakes with the food, he displayed no concern and said he did not have time for this. We wanted a refund, but all he would give us was a $20 gift card, as if we WANT to go back. As we were speaking with the manager, another customer came up to complain to him, but he rudely ignored the man and told the hostess to ""get another manager to deal with this.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=520,2.96,3.07,3.108,2.34,3.026

The waitress was pretty good about taking our orders quickly, but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen.  We weren't really a big group, there were just 5 of us.  Also, no one in our group ordered pizza, so I wasn't sure why the kitchen took so long to serve us. I ordered the southern fried chicken lunch special.  In the picture, the chicken fried steak looks like a big healthy portion.  When the plate came out, I was wondering, where is the rest of it?  I was ok with the small chicken fried steak portion, because it was lunch, but the photo had a plentiful platter of corn.  The corn looked like confetti on my plate that was acattered sparsely. Overall, I really like BJs.  It is a good place to grab beers, ciders, or drinks.  I think it is a good place to go if you want to relax and watch 9 innings of baseball, because the pace of the food service will probably take you to the 9th inning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=380,3.0,3.06,3.108,2.604,3.0360000000000005

One thing I just can't get over is how no matter what time or day you come here it's always busy. I pass by numerous times each week and every time the car park is full with people waiting outside for their table. I feel like I'm missing something, do they have a secret topless service hidden out the back somewhere or something? Because it sure can't be for the speedy service or food. It's the kind of place I imagine you would come if you can't decide where else to eat.  The food here really is just mediocre, borderline ''ok''. A lot of which is almost certainly cooked from frozen and overpriced for the quality you get. I think the highlight of their menu is the very well known Pizookie which although nice isn't amazing either.  My husband and I came here with a coupon for one of the free Pizooki for his Birthday and as they had ran out of every flavor except for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ( ) that was the one we ended up with. The Ice Cream was nice but the middle of the Cookie (as others have also mentioned) was under cooked. But hey.. It's free so I can't really complain.

The waitress came by and took our order for drinks. She didn't even know what drink my boyfriend wanted and had to look at the menu. A couple minutes later we ordered our entreés. I asked Ye waitress if I was able to add meatballs to one of the pasta dishes and she didn't know and referred me to the appetizer section to order them from there as a side-they were not an option. I just went a head and order Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs added. Wile we were waiting, these guys (who were rude and obnoxious) decided it was okay to take their beers and pull out reserved chairs and sit blocking the exit doors to have their own loud mingle session. Seeing that I was already a little annoyed, this shot my entire mood down. One guy took out a cigarette and smoked right by everyone else why they were eating next to a 'no smoking allowed' sign. Now, you might be wondering what his has to do with their service. The staff did not do anything about it and seemed to let it go. The manager even had a little pow wow with them.

Unfortunately, I experienced below mediocre service and food.  My husband and I dined here on Monday, November 12, 2012 at around 1 PM.  We were seated after about 10 minutes and our waitress came asking if wanted any drinks or appetizers. We mentioned that we needed a couple minutes to decide on what to order. She took those ""couple"" minutes and doubled it because it didn't take us 15 minutes to decide on what to order. A couple minutes usually means 5 minutes in my opinion. We patiently waited and waited for her to return. And FINALLY, she arrives! I ordered a BJ's bacon cheeseburger and my hubby ordered broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl.  Service here is super slow and I couldn't seem to grasp why because the restaurant was not busy. There were several empty tables and plenty of waiters/waitresses walking around. When our food arrived after God knows how long, we were ready to dig in. My burger was ok and cooked well-done just as I requested. I could taste the char-broiled meat as I sunk my teeth in. The bacon was burnt, overcooked, and dry. I am a bacon lover and bacon -hands down- is what makes a burger so much better. This burger just did not do it for me. I've had better burgers at Red Robin and that chain is supposed to be worse.  My husband was enjoying his soup until he noticed mold on the bread cap of his bread bowl. He immediately stopped eating and informed our waitress. Her response was, ""Oh, let me tell someone."" She did not apologize. Less than 2 minutes later, a man with a blue buttoned down shirt (I'm assuming he was some sort of supervisor or manager) approached our table regarding the molded bread. He said, ""No, that doesn't look right. Would you like us to get you a new one?"" This response would have been just fine except he too did not apologize for us having been served mold.

FOOD - it's a chain.  The food is fine. SERVICE - Terrible!  I ate here today with my daughter.  I ordered a salad, she ordered the mini-corn dogs off the kid's menu, and we also ordered two mini-appetizers.  They went 0 for 4; they messed up all four things!  First the entrees arrived, no appetizers in sight.  The waitress came by a few minutes later and said, ""oh!  the appetizers didn't get here first?.""  Ummm...no they didn't.  We told her to cancel those now that we had our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later and said one of them was ready and asked if we wanted them anyway and that she ""would take care of that.""  Sure.  Then the manager dropped off the other one and he also said he ""would take care of that.""  Whatever.  Anyway, I ordered my salad with no dressing.  It came smothered in dressing.  And my daughter's applesauce didn't come with a spoon (or any kid's utensils for that matter).  We eventually flagged someone down, not a big deal but strikeout number four.  The waitress was apologetic.  Then when the bill came, I was somewhat shocked to see that I was being charged for the appetizers!!  I paid the bill and when the waitress came by to pick it up, I pointed out that she did charge me for the appetizers.  I'm not entirely sure if they meant to charge me or not (what does ""take care of that"" mean anyway?), but she voided the transaction and brought me a new bill.  I paid up and caught the manager on the way out to briefly tell him how bad the service was.  He said he hoped they could do better next time.  Well, I don't think there is going to be a next time! Summary, the food is fine.  Nothing special, but you can find something for everyone here and it's going to reasonably good.  The service is lacking however.  It starts at the top and this restaurant needs a complete overhaul.  Based on the other reviews, I don't seem to be the only one who has been disappointed here.  Anyway, it was a $30 lunch, not a $300 dinner.  I've given them the yelp review they deserve and I'm over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=660,2.32,2.83,2.988,1.988,2.6260000000000003

BJ's allows you to call in ahead of time and put your name on the wait list to avoid waiting as long, which is exactly why I called in.  Even though it wasn't a very busy night judging by the number of people waiting outside (and then the number of empty tables there were when we walked in later), I was put on hold for 10 minutes just to put my name down. When I asked the girl on the other line (the hostess) how long the wait would be she told me probably 20 minutes, which was expected. However, when we got there 20 minutes later, the hostess told me it would be another 30-35 minutes. When I told her I had my name on the list and that we were told it would be a 20 minute wait when I called in (which is why we got there later), she looked at me really annoyed, and in a really condescending tone told me that their wait times always change and she couldn't prioritize me over other people who walked in just because I had called (even though that is kind of the point of calling in and putting your name on the list).

When we arrived they were absolutely crushed.  There were people packed inside the entrance and people spilling out the door waiting for a table.  I figured we would surely be waiting for hours.  When I checked in with the hostess she was super nice and said it would only be about 20 minutes.  I was still skeptical (yes I'm a pessimist) but took the pager and tried to stay out of the way.  After about 10 mins our table was ready!  I was totally shocked. The service from the waiter was ok especially considering how many people we were although he was definitely a bit frazzled.  The food was decent as you would expect from BJs.   The only negative is it took a while to get our food and then the check.  The waiter finally brought the check without asking if other half of the table wanted dessert (which a couple of the kids did).  Yes, we could have still ordered dessert but it was getting late and we didn't want to wait.

BS,  it was almost half an hour past the res time when we were seated. Our server was pleasant, but, that's the only positive thing i can say about him. Drink orders were given, and after a VERY long time he brought them out-half of them. He forgot what everyone else had ordered, and then incorrect beverages were brought out anyway. MY FIL wanted to say something, but was unable to get the anyone's attention. The food order took a very, very long time as well. We saw some people we knew who were seated at the exact same time as us, had apps and entrees and were out in under an hour. It took us over two hours from the time we (FINALLY) got seated to the time the check was paid. My bison burger and my husband's burger came out super well done, when we both requested medium. We sent them back, mine came back cooked correctly, and in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't know what the deal was with my husband's, but his took way too long. The worst part? When he finally got it, it was still overcooked. Obviously, at this point he just ate it. He also tasted the GIL's spaghetti and meatballs, and said mine was much better, (and my version is even a healthy version!) When we got the bill, they did comp both our meals. I appreciated that, especially since we ended up eating ours after everyone else was almost done.

The overall wait time for a table at 6pm on a Saturday wasn't bad at all (about 10 minutes).   When we got to our table we ordered drinks from the bar (I ordered the sangria and my friend ordered the peach margarita) when we got them they were very very very sweet (and i stress the VERY) and tasted like juice. Normally I wouldn't complain about such a sweet drink but this was overly sweet like my teeth HURT!  We ordered pretty quickly having come there plenty of times before, I knew what I wanted (A BBQ ranch chicken salad) and my friend ordered a (i believe its called) Thai Chicken salad. It tasted good. I enjoyed it. We even ordered a pazookie to share after our salads.  Since this BJ's is so close to the Target in Bridgepoint we decided to take a little stroll through after our meal. It wasn't even 30 minutes after eating and I felt really really sick and my friend did too! I needed to go home and QUICKLY! We got food poisioning! Bad.

Food is variable-- many dishes are good, but avoid the pot roast open face sandwich with mashed potatoes, this is a misconceived dish. Also, the side salad is... a wan, sad little plate of lettuce that has seen better days. What's been good: things like fried calamari, fries, fish and chips, burgers, etc.; and the beer selection, which should have something for everyone. (I wish they had a better cider selection.) In the past I've had their thin crust pizzas, which I really like. Also, having calorie counts next to everything helps with smart choices, and they have a special menu with an assortment of low-calorie, satisfying offerings that are worth trying.  Also, surprisingly, it's fairly kid-friendly. When my wife and I go with our two year old we generally have a good experience.  Service can be a little uneven and slow, but is always polite and well-intentioned.

You have access to the full menu and the ability to enter special requests. Shortly after I placed my order I received a text message providing confirmation. When I arrived to pick up the order it was ready and waiting. I reviewed the receipt, everything was correct and I paid for the order. Then as the bag was being packed I noticed that the salad had blackened salmon on it instead of blackened shrimp. After 2 different people asked me if I specified shrimp and not salmon, they apologized and said it would just a few minutes to correct the order. It ended up taking about 12 minutes to correct the order. When I got home and opened the salad, it still had the salmon in it with the shrimp on top. I did not want salmon! Additionally, I ordered a pizza with olives and pepperoni but when I opened the box there were no olives on it. The pizza crust was totally limp and flimsy. The order was not complex and the restaurant was not busy when I got there. There really is no good reason for the order being wrong.

626,Jojo L.,"San Mateo, CA",398,70,68.0,1.0,2013-09-01,"On the whole, BJ's offers pretty consistent food.  I've enjoy their deep dish pizzas and happy hour beer selection a handful of times.  However this review reflects the customer service at this location (which as you can tell by my one star rating is abysmal).  I came here on a Friday evening with my family so I totally understand that Friday nights are a busy time. We did call ahead around 6:45 pm to see how long the wait was going to be and they said about 20 mins.  so We arrive around 7:10 and they hand us the beeper and again reassure us, its going to be about a 20 minute wait.  Around 30 mins in we ask if our tables almost ready and the response we get is ""Almost, we are trying to find some chairs"".   How on earth can a restaurant not have enough chairs!  We wait for another 10 minutes so 40 minutes total!  Not so happy when I'm hangry and people lie to me.  We're finally seated and it takes the waitress for ever to come by and get our drink order.  Poor girl is running around everywhere.  We put in our order (a large pizza- half spicy meatball/ half Mediterranean chicken, the appetizer party platter, a Moroccan salmon and clam chowder bread bowl).  The appetizer platter comes out pretty fast but there's no plates.... the waiter told us he was ""trying to find some"".  Ok, again BJ's was packed, I get that, BUT shouldn't the management anticipate that and kinda figure out a way to have enough plates on hand/ rewashed so that they can keep up with their capacity? I guess not bc they're short of everything at this place!! We're so hungry at this point, we just start digging into the dips and mozzarella sticks since its all finger food anyways.  Next my dad's chowder arrives but its in a BOWL not a bread bowl like we order so they have to swap it out for us. Seriously? how many things can go wrong in a given night? Luckily, the chowder was pretty delicious so it was worth it to wait.  The rest of the food arrived pretty soon after that.  The toppings on the pizza were kinda all over the the place, you could tell that the kitchen staff was in such a rush bc the the toppings from the med. chicken and spicy meatball over lapped a lot. whatever, it all ends up in your stomach, right?  The salmon was meh, would not order it again. FOOD: 3.5 stars SERVICE: .5 star ATMOSPHERE: 3 stars So, I'm not ruling BJ's out in the future completely (late night pizzokies may have something to do with another visit), I would just avoid it like the plague if I had to come during the weekends because obviously they can't deliver proper service if it's at full capacity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=440,2.24,2.47,2.84,1.7000000000000002,2.3780000000000006

I was part of a party of 6 (including my 2 year old daughter) and was seated 50 minutes after arrival. When we first arrived they seemed busy so I understood the wait, but then it slowed down a lot and I assumed they were trying to catch up.  After we were finally seated, we ordered some drinks and then again waited another 15 minutes for our server to come back around and get our appetizer order.  We planned on ordering our meal right then, but one of our party members stepped out so we decided to wait until he returned. About 5 mins later he did and she was nowhere in sight.  So we waited again.  We waited for 30 minutes for this server! It wasn't even busy in the restaurant!  At this point we had barley received our appetizers. After we ordered we were confident that it would be smooth sailing from here. Far from it. After another 20 minute wait I THEN see her start to enter our order in the POS system!! I've been in the food industry for years and I know that the kitchen does not receive your order until you enter it in! I was in shock.  A good 45 minutes goes by and I asked her where our food was. She goes back to the kitchen and then almost immediately brings it out..... Guess she forgot about us?  Anyways, we all got our plates and the order was correct. I ordered ribs for myself and macaroni for my daughter. FOOD QUALITY: ONE GRADE ABOVE DOG FOOD. The ribs were very tough, bare, AND COLD!! In addition, my daughters macaroni was from a box brand that I could have bought from a mini-mart!  By the time she took it back to heat up and brought it back out, everyone was already done with their meal. At this point I lost my appetite. I ate a few strips then asked for it to go. Bill was 170 and if I had it my way she wouldn't have received a tip, but some others in the party felt bad so they gave her a few dollars.  Point is I couldn't find this girl the whole night and we waited for over 2 hours! That is unheard of! Fast forward to tonight. I came home and was hungry for a snack so I ate the BJ's left overs. Well, I should have known better by now but I didn't realize the nightmare wasn't over. I ate the left over macoroni and ribs. Last thing I ate tonight. It is now 4:00am and I have FOOD POISONING!

I never had bad experiences, but just nothing memorable that would make me return neither, and this BJ holds the same ground. Me and the Boyfriend was looking into trying something new. We never explored San Mateo (or more like, never gave it a chance), so he decided BJ's would be a great start for food exploration. LOCATION: The restaurant is fairly easy to locate (it may be easy if I followed my GPS, but the Boyfriend fancied himself a good navigator; we took a few extra turns and blocks to get here). If you've been to a BJ before then you know this restaurant looks as if they have a ginormous ceiling from the outside. You can't miss it. It's well lit with LED lighting and a easy on the eyes but attractive yellows and oranges painted on the exterior. A color that says ""we're fun, come in!"" PARKING: Definitely not an issue, and it shouldn't be (accept for Oakridge area). We came here on a Tuesday early evening, so there was plenty of parking spots. ENTRY: We were greeted by two(2) young ladies at the front (how unfortunate, they didn't smile - tsk tsk tsk). Once we told them ""party for two(2)"", they had a young gentlemen seat us. INTERIOR: There is certainly a lot going on for the interior. From colors, to light fixtures, to photos to artworks. It makes waiting for your food not so long (unfortunately for both parties that was sitting on both sides of us -they had not so happy experience -one waited over an hour for their food and the other didn't touch their food). SERVICE: The experience upon our entry can definitely improve with more eye contact and smile -definitely would help (someone re-train these kids the basics of customer service). Our waiter was pleasant and professional. He was probably the best customer service we've had the entire time there (sorry, I don't remember your name and I don't have the receipt that might have your name on it). Our food came out on a pretty decent time. FOOD: We ordered several snacks and appetizers to have a bit of variety. Incredibly disappointed. Out of all the selection of the Appetizer Combo, the only thing that had flavor was the spinach and artichoke dip. The rest was surprisingly bland (how can mozzarella sticks be bland?). The California club, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Grilled Chicken club was bland.

Well, it came with the dressing on the side but they still sprinkled bacon bits all over the food and plate.  We told them we wanted it remade so a vegetarian could eat it and he didn't understand why we couldn't just brush off the bacon.  If any of you are a vegetarian or have vegetarian friends you know that you can't just ""brush it off"" to make it a vegetarian dish. #3 - My pizza, which they are supposed to be known for, was EXTREMELY dry.  There was almost NO sauce on it and it took me about 5 minutes to even get ahold of the waiter to ask for a side of dressing.

I was hardly recognized by the waiter, when I walked in to allow a table. Nothing. If she was having a bad day and could not suck it up, whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting, my cousin (being the optimistic, foolish guy he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I'm adorable"" jokingly. I look over and it is that same girl with the attitude staring at us. It really felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the event. Requested to speak to a supervisor because it was definitely uncalled for, regarding what occurred. No one called back. Thanks for the direction of that BJ. Actually professional. The kicker? I think it is pretty absurd for anyone to have this behaviour, especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are lots of other people who work through and can suck up whatever they're going and actually be grateful for a job and show it. I have been spit at/on, attacked, had I was yelled at by every obscenity, whatever you'll be able to think of on the job, and you understand what? I still suck it up and do my job because that's what I was hired to do. Not behave like an immature brat for no reason in any way.

The menu is gigantic, the beer choices are plentiful, the place was packed at 6:30 on a  Friday night. We had three entrees, a house salad, two beers, and a cider for $61. Very reasonable. Our food choices were a Thai Mango Avocado Salad for $12.50, a Margherita Flatbread ($9.75), and a Honey Lime Scallops ( from the calorie friendly ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu) for $13.95. The scallops were listed as 370 calories, so I was expecting a small plate, but man was I wrong. It was six big scallops, a modest portion of rice, and a huge serving of asparagus.

455,Emily M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,2.0,2014-09-12,"This was my first time visiting a BJ's. The menu looked awesome, but the service was really bad. I usually roll my eyes when Yelp reviewers place a big emphasis on service at restaurants. My general philosophy is that if the food's good, service isn't that important. This place turned out to be the exception.  The restaurant was dead (we came well before the dinner rush), but the hostess took quite a bit of time to seat us. And she looked very confused and utterly terrified of people. I assumed it was her first day. Not a big deal, I know what it's like to be new at a food service job.  My boyfriend and I split the avocado egg rolls (amazing!). I ordered a Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad with dressing on the side, and my boyfriend ordered a medium bone-in New York steak.  My salad was served with the dressing mixed in. Meh, kind of a bummer, but again, not TOO huge a deal. I rarely send food back, so I just ate the salad. It was OK.  But then my boyfriend started eating his steak. It was rarer than rare - probably the least-cooked steak I have ever laid eyes on. Again, he ordered it medium.  We asked the waitress (kindly) if she could take the steak back so it could be cooked a bit longer. She asked us if we wanted the same steak cooked longer, or a new steak. We let her know we were fine with the same steak, and she took it back without another word.   Not once did the waitress apologize. Again, sometimes steak gets undercooked. It happens. But when it does, the very least the server can do is say a quick sorry.  Maybe we came at a really weird time or something, when they happened to be training all their staff at once? There's just too many great independent restaurants around here to bother going back here if it's going to be a mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=400,2.72,2.65,2.604,2.12,2.678

However this time I felt the service was beyond terrible. I came in and was seated very quickly. When the waiter Gustavo came around he asked us if we were ready to order. Being such a regular I always ask for the spaghetti with the spicy tomato sauce. I asked him if I could have a Shirley temple to drink and also two waters with lemons and of course like usual I asked for the spaghetti. Then he rudely said that's not in the menu. Therefore I ask for a minute to see what else I could order since I was not aware of the menu changes. He comes back with our drinks. The waters had no lemons in it and my Shirley temple tasted like carbonated water with a touch of grenadine. I put in my order and also asked if he could bring us more lemons. He passed us by 5 times and not once did he asked if we needed anything else and he still had not brought the lemons. I couldn't even tell him about my drink because he would ignore us every time he passed by. My food came out and I needed ketchup but I couldn't even ask him for that because he had not come to check on us therefore I had to ask someone else that was not our waiter if she could bring us condiments. Afterwards he still walked by without acknowledging us and at that point I felt that the service we were receiving was not right and very unpleasant. I spoke to a manager and he was quick to getting my drink fixed and asked us if we needed anything else.

Drinks were empty, I'm already getting grouchy because NONE of our appetizers arrived, and I was shaking from hunger. Another waitress (not our original waiter Michael) came out and dropped off the pizza to the table. I looked at my boyfriend and said ""WTF?!"" I was livid.  He then came to our table and also gave me a look like ""WHAT!?"" and told me that that wasn't supposed happen. So I asked ""Then what the hell happened, where are the salads and our avocado rolls""  15 mins after we were done with our pizza; the salads and the rolls arrived, I almost threw it back onto his tray and said FORGET IT! We still nibbled and ate a little of each. The sweet manager Tina came over and apologized on his behalf and told me she'll take care of the rolls for us. Which was nice. He came back a little later to drop the check and made another mistake by adding another entire table's bill to our check making is WAYYY HIGHER than its actually really was.

Skinny fries were pretty killer. My co-worker got a flat bread pizza thing and it looked pretty standard. Albeit kinda greasy. Second trip was for a later dinner after tearing down the booth. Apparently others had the same idea and the place was pretty packed for a Sunday night around 8:30. Started with a BJ's Berry Jack Lemonade - not a fan. Too much sweet/sour - weird after taste. Southwest egg rolls were pretty good though. Went with the fried chicken (lunch portion) for dinner - tasty. Overall the food is average, but the service is  lack-luster.

It took a lot less time to eat it than the wait time. I had gotten a coupon for a free pizooki for my bday so it was so not worth the hassle.

313,Boss H.,"San Francisco, CA",337,30,68.0,2.0,2015-10-17,"I usually love coming to BJ's, but this was by far the worst experience I've encountered. We came in at 9:30pm on a Saturday night and was surprised that there was no wait ; we were seated almost immediately. Once the order was placed it took nearly 40 mins for our food to come. Upon the completion of our meals the bill was brought out without a b-day shout out to one person in our party. We notified the staff about the mix up and they said they forgot to tell our waitress. Our server brought out a pazookie, slapped it on the table, lit the candle and then walked away without even saying happy birthday. To top off the evening I took my two sons to the restroom before leaving and was disgusted at the condition of the bathroom.

I've been to this location countless times since I was a kid - even had one of my birthday dinners here when I was about... 14? 15? Strange times. Anyway - I've been back a few times in these recent years for appetizers and drank. Usually not here for a full meal because it's so $$$. Appetizers are big enough that they can be split - portion and money wise. BJ's has their own brews which is such a huge plus for a chain restaurant. Although their brews are average, I still enjoy trying what's available and the occasional seasonal ones. Plenty of guest brews (tap and bottle) which rotate from time to time.  Huge ass menus. It's hard to pick something every time. I usually end up picking the same ol' thing just to avoid the indecisiveness. I've gotten the carnitas fries twice now and I was surprised both times as to how good they were... the fries were extra thing and crispy just how I like. All their pizzas are also usually really good. Burgers are pretty average though they hit the spot when you have a burger craving. Everything else is pretty so-so. Fun to just order new things sometimes to share with a group. Service has been okay - can be really slow at times but waiters are friendly. Food takes forever to come out. May as well call in an order before you arrive... When it's busy, waiting and food service gets even slower. Thankfully, I don't really come in during rush hours anymore - I just stick to early afternoons now. Your average chain restaurant.

This review is about my experience on one specific day, 10/31/15 at the host counter. We walked in around 1:15-1:30 and there was no one waiting to be seated so we walked up to the counter. There were two employees having a discussion about a customer that they just seated at their table. As we approached the counter, the male employee (wearing white contact lenses, it was Halloween) looked up at us out of the corner of his eye and continued his conversation for a few more sentences. Then greeted us with a simple ""Hi"" and nothing else. We asked for a table for two and he walked away from the counter, then looked back at us and said, ""Follow me, Ill find you your table.""  Does that mean we're going on a search for a table?  He then walked us to our table, set the menus down and said something to the effect of ""here you go"" (I don't remember the exact phrase/quote).  Our waiter was busy, but attentive and apologetic for being busy and took our orders pretty quickly and brought our drinks out almost immediately.  Our overall service was good, as expected.  I did notice the same host continually leaving the host counter unattended while people came in, and even saw one party leave after standing up there for a few minutes with no one to greet them. Meanwhile the host was over by one of the server stations chatting with one of the female servers who kept trying to end the conversation to get back to work, and she even asked if he was on his break, and he said he wasn't. The entire time he was at work, he had an extremely stern scowl on his face.

This place provides, without a doubt, the worst Take Out experience. In addition,  dine-in Customer experience is subpar.  And the bartenders serve old bad wine and don't know anything other than pouring a beer. When ordering take-out onsite, dont be surprised if they take an extra 30 mins beyond what they communicate.  Don't be surprised if their staff tells you to use their mobile App to pay for take-out, so they can force you to pay a tip, without even knowing. Dont be surprised if they refuse to provide a refund afterwards.  Don't be surprised if they are extremely slow and unprofessional. Don't be surprised if you receive someone else's order.  For dining in, don't be surprised if you receive the wrong order. Disgusting unserviced restrooms as well.  Don't be surprised if half their staff (on a busy evening) is out front, socializing, smoking cigarettes and cursing up a storm while kids walk by.

I needed ketchup and the waiter never came to ask if we needed anything. Had to eat potatoes without ketchup. Food took a long time to come out too!! Ordered a pizza and some pasta.

I asked the guy if he could bring cheese and pepper for the pizza. Well, I waited and waited and nothing!!!! Yet I saw him bringing out food to the large party by us, made eye contact with him and I never received the cheese and pepper.

However, after 3 consecutive negative experiences, I think two stars are necessary. I have always loved the pasta and flatbreads at BJs. I've also enjoyed eating pizookies and drinking their ambers, however, I think this location just has staff and waiters who aren't trained properly. Came here with a large group of friends and started off ordering a salad. I know large groups are difficult to deal with AND I had an allergy request, but it took three tries and over an hour before I got my food. I'm allergic to tomatoes and nuts. Our waiter came back after we had ordered to tell me that something in the salad contained nuts and it could not be made without nuts, so he had me order something else off of the allergen menu. I ordered a club flatbread. The waiter didn't hear the flatbread part, and I ended up with a club sandwich. Later, the waiter brought me the flatbread that I ordered but forgot about my tomato allergy. So about 30 minutes after the last attempt, after my friends had finished eating, I finally received the flatbread that I wasn't allergic to.  I came back here again for lunch with my dad and had a mishap with the bill. My dad had ordered the salmon and couscous for lunch. But our waiter charged us for a dinner sized portion. My dad didn't mind paying the more expensive meal, however, he wanted to point out that it wasn't what he ordered. The waiter was very rude and insisted he was correct and my father was in the wrong. Then he said he would adjust the price of the meal and make it the lunch price instead. But had to add that it was my father's mistake. Later when the final bill came, we saw that he didn't adjust the price at all. However, after waiting 30 minutes for him to get us the bill, we were tired of waiting and left just paid the bill and left. On a third recent experience, we were served what seemed to be scraps of mushrooms as ""stuffed mushrooms."" Upon first glance, the mushrooms seemed to be leftover scraps of mushrooms, some whole, some pieces, some tiny. Then we actually took a bite and realized that they were cold. Not room temperature or lukewarm, but cold. We asked our waiter if their stuffed mushrooms were supposed to be cold, and she seemed surprised and replied no. We were just very confused as to how this was an appetizer you would actually serve people. Also at this dinner, we ordered flatbread pizzas, which were uncut or only cut in half. And after pointing that out to the waitress, she just gave us steak knives for us to cut our flatbreads ourselves. After these three confusing and unpleasant recent experiences, I just hope other BJs haven't fallen to this level.

What was worst is the guy who came out each time was making mean faces at me and is ruder than usual. (I would guess these folks don't like their job. I used to tip them some cash because I know it's hard work but nothing this time.) Anyways very frustrated and will never use their curbside pick up again. I asked for a manager to complain about waiting outside for over an hour and the line magically got disconnected, ha! Others curbside orders weren't smooth either but I always gave them the benefit of the doubt. They're late ~10 mins. and delivery guys seem pretty unhappy. :( At least orders were fine and food was good before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=260,2.48,2.52,2.584,2.34,2.504

97,Angela B.,"San Mateo, CA",106,146,5.0,1.0,2016-08-03,"I sent this email almost on 07/13/2016 with no response; not even an apology.  Good Evening,  I have spent the last few days debating on whether or not to send you an email about the behavior of your manager as well as the waiter at the San Mateo location, but with a lot of thought I think its best you know of a situation that happened last week; 07/08/2016 - 645pm My friend and I came in for dinner, sat promptly at a table in the bar and was greeted by Andrew N. who took our drink order, as well as our food order (which included an appetizer)  I was very clear as to what I wanted, the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer (happy hour was ending in a few minutes so we wanted to put that order in)  I also wanted the fish tacos with no sauce and guacamole on the side, my friend a salad with ranch and the spaghetti with meatballs - didn't sound or seem too difficult.  My friends salad arrived, and it didn't have any dressing on it so we asked the bus person to please bring some, and they did so without hesitation.  Our dinner then arrives, not our appetizer but our dinner. I first comment on that to the bus person and they go over to Andrew who then comes over to tell me that he did not put our appetizer order in and that it is passed happy hour time and the discount would have to be applied manually - all things neither of us really cared to know. But then I look down and my fish tacos are covered in the avocado and mayo sauce, I probably would have got over it and scraped the sauce off had the fish and the shrimp not been cold. But they were cold, ice cold actually.  I ask Andrew to get me a new order, and I know its not great being told something is messed up and I also know that having a customer complain is never a good thing.  About 15 minutes go by, it shouldn't take that long to make shrimp or fish - but I get it the restaurant is busy its dinner time so I let a few more minutes go by. The waiter brings my food over himself, and I immediately caught this horrible whiff of something sour and pungent - old fish is exactly what it was. The people next to us even made a comment about the smell.  I then asked for the manager, as this was now an issue. My friend had, had her meal now for over 20 minutes and was politely waiting on me to get my meal.  The manager comes over after about 7 minutes with another plate of food - I went over to touch it and he yanked the plate away and told me not to touch it. I found this to be odd, I am a paying customer I can and will do as I see fit to the meal you're supposed to be serving me. I told him how frustrated I was, and he stood there shaking like a leaf and told me ""I will take it off the bill if thats all you want""  But really, that wasn't all I wanted, i wanted to eat dinner - enjoy my time with my friend and possibly have dessert. But he was so rude and unprofessional I was in complete shock.  The bill then comes, and there it was the fish tacos no discount taken and the chicken lettuce cups.  I point this out to the waiter, who then sends the manager over - again. Shaking like a leaf, I explain to him our issues and what brought us to this point and that being in hospitality he has to suck it up and deal with all kinds of people - regardless of attitude or tone he needed to hear me out before walking away from someone.  He still shaking - with a very condescending tone asks what it is that I want, and I told him that I want the meal and the chicken lettuce wraps taken off the bill and that I would like to pay - but not before getting the general managers information.  His tone then changes, did he think I was not wise enough to know someone was above him? Did he think I was going to let this one go? I have always been pleased with the food and service I receive from this location so to be spoken to or treated otherwise was a bit of a shock - hence my delay in even sending this email.  When he comes over, after my friend and I had paid - he says he's going to take care of everything - now this threw me off. He saw that we paid, saw that my card was already handed back to me - yet he now all of a sudden is going to take care of our bill. It just didnt make sense to me or my friend at all.  I dont know what happens to managers that treat customers horribly, but I do know that being in human resources that if ever one of my representatives of the company I work for spoke to someone the way I was spoken to I would have been sure to not only give them a written warning but to probably put them on a final warning.  Now, as far as how you all handle things is up to you - but I can not see myself going to this location in the evening again knowing he was or will be there and with the possibility of him recognizing me and doing who knows what to my meal, drink, dessert or check. I know you're going to reassure me that things that I am imagining dont happen - but lets be honest here. You just never know 100%",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=100,2.52,2.54,2.584,2.372,2.532

The ahi poke appetizer is  A LOT LESS in quantity and less tasty. I always have to ask for extra sauce on the side. This goes for both San Bruno and Foster City locations (except tonight, my extra sauce never came!). I also noticed that the spinach artichoke dip is not as dense as before. Seems very light and almost ""whippy."" Still okay, but not as good. Ordered the sliders and the presentation was not at all appealing to the naked eye. The mini burgers just looked like it was prepared in a hurry with cracks and fingerprint indentations on the top bread (like it was slapped on). To top it off, one of the sliders' meat was about the size of a quarter (okay, slightly bigger than a quarter). I wanted to express this to our server, but hesitated. She must've noticed and expressed our concerned looks to the Manager, because he came up to our table to ask what was wrong and how he could be of help. I just explained how tiny the meat was on one of the sliders and he apologized and offered to give us free dessert, which was pretty awesome (had the pizookie, of course!). Despite of, I still gave it 3 because the Manager did express his apologies and gave us a free dessert, which makes me think that he will have a ""talk"" with the slider preparers in the kitchen (maybe be more strict about consistency).

I have just moved to a new city halfway across the country and had a really long birthday with none of my close friends or family here to celebrate with. I had some errands to do in Bridgepointe park when I stumbled into BJ's and was welcomed in like a regular. The bartender was incredibly kind and made me feel really happy to be there. I ordered some calamari and potato wedges with some wine (such a weird combination, but hey, it was my birthday). He told me not to leave quite yet as he had a surprise for me and a few minutes later he came out with a birthday Cookies n' Cream Pizookie.

About half an hour after placing the order our waitress came over to apologize for not bringing our appetizer (boneless wings) yet. She said they would take it of our order and that the entrees would come out shortly. We insisted to still get our appetizer and asked to bring them prior to bringing out the entrees. About 10 minutes later our entrees were served and to my surprise there was a Mentos (see uploaded picture) in between my fries. They took back my plate and brought out the entree on another plate 5 min later. The burger and fries were cold so they probably just changed plates and removed the Mentos. Finally 10 minutes later our appetizer arrived.

It's not her fault the person before her didn't come give me some water or something.  I ordered the boneless wings and the peanut butter smores pizzookie. I got the wings with a root beer glaze and it was pretty good. It was like a sweeter version of a BBQ sauce. The chicken was crunchy and crispy so that was nice and the sauce was good too. I wish I had more ranch tho.  The pizzookie looked amazing. It was a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips, with a layer of pb on top, toasted marshmallows on top, and two scoops of vanilla ice cream.

My boyfriend and I ordered our food .called to pick up curbside and the phone range for 5mins ,no one picked up and when I finally got ahold of someone the girl was really ,really rude . She never relayed the message that we were waiting for our food .we sat at curbside for almost a hour before getting our food . Tried ordering again last week (curbside) and called to inform them we were waiting for food and phone was busy or off the hook for 15mins (heard from inside source they tend to do that if they don't want to bring food out and being lazy  ). I finally had to call the main number and then they brought out our food. What's the point of fast curbside pick up if your not going to answer and do your job to deliver food in a timely manner ?? Every time we have come to curbside all the kitchen staff decides to have a smoke break outside .

No one even changed it after asking for it.  - we were celebrating my daughters birthday and they just dumped the cake still in the box - then for 15 mins no one cleaned dinner table after dumping the cake box on the dirty table - after cleaning the table no one gave silverware to eat or cut the cake.

185,Alexandria G.,"San Leandro, CA",131,23,22.0,3.0,2017-05-08,"So this BJ's offers service consistent with what you would expect from a BJ's Brewery. The food is pretty good, the service is okay, and the atmosphere is lively. On my last visit to this location, I ordered their weekend prime rib special as did my brother. What I would say when comparing our two plates is there wasn't much consistency in terms of how they served their meat. We both ordered a 14oz cooked medium rare. His looked a bit darker than medium rare in comparison to mine but was also about a half an inch thicker than my cut. Further, their side dish portions left something to be desired when a side of broccoli was about 5 spears lol.  In terms of the service, the waitstaff was nice. However, it did appear as if maybe they were over worked as our waitress was a bit forgetful as a result. It also seemed as if they didn't want to completely utilize their restaurant space as it felt like my party as well as other parties, were confined to a small area near the entrance and bar.  Aside from all of that, the restaurant itself is family friendly as they do offer a kids meal. They have a full bar and TV's that play different sporting events. Parking isn't an issue as they are in a shopping center with a huge lot.

It took about 10 before she finally came back to us for a drink order.

So if you've been doing the math, we've now been sitting there for 50 minutes and have received 1 drink. Finally, I got up and found another server to close us out.

This is typical for a BJs where it will never be horrible ... unless you show up at 7 pm. We were one of very few groups at 4:30, but by 6 the place was jam packed.   On the beer, my #1 and one of my favorite beers anywhere is the Jeremiah Red. The berry burst cider was also good today, but i was unimpressed by the porter, the LH lager, and the Oasis. For food, the happy hour specials aren't bad, but as I know from travelling a lot, you need the discount because of how high prices are in Silicon Valley. The flatbread veggie wasn't great, but was edible. The avocado spring rolls were awesome. The calamari was average. The spinach dip i think it was was very, very good. The Brussels sprouts were better than expected. We all did pizzas also, veggie, a pepperoni, and I did a five meat. In all cases they seemed a little undercooked and required a fork to eat.  The service was a little hit or miss. Despite being some of the first people there our apps were slow, and we waited a while at times for beer despite sitting at the table directly next to the bar. Our waitresses weren't rude, but their friendliness definitely didn't make us order more or tip more than 18%.  ...

We came in last night, Sunday Sept. 17, 2018 for my sister in laws birthday and the service was appalling to say the least. Our server  NIHAL was very inexperienced, unprofessional and unapologetic. While taking our orders she was distracted and didn't seem to know the proper use of her hand held ordering device. She didn't get our drinks right, she didn't order any of our appetizers correctly and none of our food was right.  When our drinks came she didn't know that your signature Root beer Float actually came with ice cream. When our appetizers came out, two thirds of the trio never came. When our food came out no one got their food at the same time and my sister in law, who's birthday we were celebrating, steak was over cooked and charred when she ordered a med- well.  Another one of our entrees was a completely different burger all together and another entree was so cold by the time her side came out that she didn't want to eat it. And while all of this was going on the appetizer that I ordered still never made it to the table nor did the 2 thirds of the trio we ordered. We sent the wrong burger back just to get the right burger with missing ingredients and poor preparation. For an example, the chicken burger was supposed to have gravy and none was found on it. The same burger was ordered without avocados and they were still in the burger and to top it off, the end of the tomato was put in the burger. The part that you cut and throw away with the black, where the vine connects to the tomato. We then asked for a side of mayo and when it was brought out to us the server who brought it said ""I'm sorry the mayo was sitting next to the pesto so it got in the mayo, is that ok?"" By then We had given up hope for a nice birthday dinner. We asked for the manager Max during this whole mess,  who was the shift manager for the evening shift at this location and he provided little help. Even with him present the entrees were still wrong or messed up. He decided compliment some of the meals that were a mess or never came or never came out at all but his body language and attitude by the end of our experience made the evening just an all around fail. And in the end we never got an apology from NIHAL and the manager MAX avoided us completely. I am writing because we actually frequent this location and have never in the years we've visited here and many of your other locations, had such a bad experience. I hope that this reaches someone whole can properly address this issue and hopefully train some of your staff on the proper serving etiquette in which you train your staff to have. Update:  I am so happy to finally do this update. The day after I posted this and emailed the company I got a very unexcpect call for the GM Gary, who then offered to comp our entire meal and then redo the entire experience all together. That following Friday the 22nd of Sept the same group of us returned to this location and was greeted my the GM himself and seated a table which had birthday balloons for my SIL. The entire evening was amazing and I'm so grateful that Gary reached out and took care of that situation.

I have to say that from the moment we arrived til the moment we walked out, we were escorted to our table by Gary (GM) who literally stopped the traffic of workers so that we could get to our table. They had birthday balloons at our table and he even allowed us to order whatever we wanted. Not only did the GM apologize for the last experience we had there but he served us personally and made sure we had everything we ordered and asked for. Our other server Steven was just as great and even went out of his way to make sure we had a great (birthday) dinner. At the end of the night they brought out a huge chocolate birthday cake for me. That was very sweet. They even gave us gift cards. Thank you Gary, for making this a wonderful experience. I appreciate this so much because I was feeling sad being that this was a place that we always enjoyed coming to with lots of family. I am happy customer once again. Thank you! P.S. My steak was perfect.  My family and I frequent this location and Im very sad to say that I had THE worst experience ever on Sunday 9/17/17! My sisters & SIL's took me out to dinner for my birthday here and we received the worst service EVER! Our waitress was new so we tried our best to keep that in mind but it was one thing after another. Between her and the cooks, everything went wrong. I ordered a Root Beer Float and she brought me Root Beer. I flagged her down to tell her I ordered a RBF and she looked at me and said ""Yes"" with a nod. I then asked where the ice cream was and she paused and with a puzzled look on her face said ""Oh, Sorry"". Everything just went downhill from there. My steak was supposed to be medium well and it came ""well done"", charred and dry. My sister got a completely different burger from what she asked for and when she finally got it, it was missing the gravy altogether. My other sister ordered sauce for her meal and her food got very cold after waiting for at least 10 minutes... she ended up NOT eating it. My Sister in law ordered 2 appetizers as her main meal and only got one. By the time she had flagged someone down (at least 20 minutes after her 1 appetizer arrived) she didn't want it anymore. There was also a trio appetizer that was never fully (only 1/3 made it to table) brought out. By the time the other 2 parts of trio came the other one was cold as hell. It was bizarre. Our waitress was often standing nearby fidgeting with her server tablet. And not really tending to our table or the many issues we were having. A manager comped the food some of the food errors but at the end of the night we paid a split tab on 2 separate cards. The next day it turns out they double charged us for our dinner. What a joke. Get it together people. Thank God a friendly server ""Treyana"" kinda helped us.

194,Lee D.,"Green Bay, WI",25,125,90.0,4.0,2017-10-04,"We ate at two locations of this chain during our time in California. The first time, I didn't know what to expect as pub food is not my favorite and that was what I anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised to see multiple salad and other vegetarian options as well a statement in the (book like) menu that stated that many other menu items could potentially be prepared to be vegetarian. I had the vegan lentil and ancient grain soup both times and it was very satisfying. The first time I had one of the salads (sorry, can't remember the name but it had baby kale, blueberries and roasted Brussel sprouts) and it was quite tasty. On the second visit, I had the cauliflower tacos and they were very good. I didn't care very much for the side of seasonal grains that came with the tacos (might have been better if it was warm and not cold). There are three options of unsweetened iced tea as well as (duh!) many beer selections. Our first visit was to the San Mateo location and my mother in law, whose name is BJ, asked if there were t-shirts for sale. The manager came out with a t-shirt and gave it to her, saying she had never met anyone named BJ! (these are the t-shirts that the wait staff wear). Today we ate at the Tanforan location; it was rather noisy and crowded inside (there was a wait even at 1:30pm) and we were offered a table in the mall ""patio"". This is covered and MUCH quieter but I would not recommend sitting at the first table since every time someone opened the mall door, the breeze would hit us and the doors slammed shut, making a lot of noise. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised both times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=40,2.56,2.45,2.544,2.32,2.494
221,Anita L.,"Union City, CA",349,627,385.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"Came on a Friday night to grab a quick bite. Luckily, our group of 5 was able to find a table right away in the bar area, which is very rare. However, we didn't seem to have a server for the whole duration we were there. It seemed there was one waitress that had to cover the whole bar area on our own, and she was so busy that she didn't come and bring us menus or take our order. I think one of the managers that was passing by happened to see that we were all waiting, so she was the one that eventually came and got our order started. Once the food came out though, there was no one that checked in on us. The one waitress did come by at the end of our meal just to bring the check, but besides that, we were pretty much left on our own. Not that we needed a ton of service, but you would think that a busy restaurant like BJ's would know better and staff more people during one of the peak times.  Food was decent though, we got the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favs), the brussel sprouts, and the avocado spring rolls to start. I ordered their pepperoni extreme flatbread and was surprised by how big it was when it came out. It was enough to fill me up for dinner as well as be enough as leftovers for my bf to eat later that night. We did want to order a Pizookie at the end, but didn't feel like flagging the waitress again, so ended up cutting the night a little short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=20,2.64,2.45,2.552,2.1559999999999997,2.5260000000000002

My last visit here was for dinner on a weekday. Overall service was slow and unprofessional. The waiter I had gave me the vibe that he was still training because he lacked simple skills like making sure our food came out of the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time or to even check back on us at all. The food here was also subpar - one of my favorite things to get from here is their BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza. The food tasted as if it had been sitting out and was even slightly burned.

They took the pizza back and brought us our veggie pizza after 40 mins. I feel as though the staff here is short handed and they definitely need to hire more employees for a busy place like this.

I came in with my family around 9pm (7 adults and two kids + nb) we order our food and it took a little longer than usual. Mind you I'm a regular at Bj's. A party of 15 sat down next to us 25 mins after our arrival and they received their food before us. When we finally got our food, 6 out of 7 meals were cold partially warm and my pizza was soggy. Food tasted warmed up from a microwave. This was absolutely disappointing! We immediately got the MOD attention because our waiter was no where to be found and he reassured us that they would have the kitchen re cook all our food in 25 mins. We turned down the offer and he waived the entire bill (duh! Why would I pay for crappy food) and told us we could order any dessert on the menu on the house. MOD ended up getting my 5 year old a fresh plate of spaghetti that was steamy hot. Here's my point is, why did i have to complain to get fresh cooked food? Shouldn't the restaurant serve fresh cooked food regardless?? We ended up eating our pazookies and leaving. MOD Never came back to check on us, i walked out the door with my family and he was standing in the foyer area talking to our waiter and didn't say anything to me or my family.

I ordered the mini BBQ chicken pizza because I wasn't that hungry ($13.25??). The food came out pretty quickly and when it came to the table it looked pretty unappealing and I know it was a mini, but man was this SMALL for the price that it was. I seriously cannot believe they charged so much for the smallest pizza. It was also so MEDIOCRE - I have had better microwaved pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland, and I definitely would NEVER order it again. I was so disappointed, and that's all I could think about as I was eating the pizza - that it was super expensive and super boring. I know this is a chain, but man, I wouldn't have paid $5 for this pizza.  My friend ordered the full rack of ribs and he barely ate half of it. There was no meat on the bones, the ribs were lacking BBQ sauce, and they looked so dry looking. My other friend ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the clam chowder was super bland and tasted watered down. My brother ordered the shrimp scampi and I felt like the noodles were NOT drained completely because the bowl of pasta was super liquidy. The pasta was bland and it tasted like straight up pasta noodles with a hint of garlic.  This place is not worth it - the food is SO expensive for horrible food. The service isn't bad, but honestly I wouldn't return just because the service is good.

231,Geny K.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,19,5.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"I really hate to leave this BJ's a bad review because I used to come here often and had no complaints on the food or services.  The waiters in the bar area are especially nice and attentive.  I came here on Monday 1/1/18 for a late lunch and our server was terriiiible.  He took forever to come and greet us (mind you it wasn't even busy, there about 3 other tables when we got there).  Then when he finally arrives he takes about 15 minutes to bring us drinks, so we decided to order right away since we didn't know how long he would take to come back.  It seemed like he would just wander into the kitchen to waste time because he would just walk back and forth between the kitchen and register (at a super slow pace) and wouldn't even check on the tables.  We got our appetizers and one of the entries together, at that point he had not brought us utensils yet,  or napkins.  I ordered a chicken Cobb salad, which took about 40 minutes to get to me.  By which the chicken was super cold and I was so annoyed that I had lost my appetite.  We had to hunt him down to ask for a drink refill or anything else.  Whenever we talked to him it seemed like he was half asleep or maybe hungover I don't know.  Anyway, the other tables that were in our area were getting really upset because they were going through the same situation as us, no utensils, no napkins, delayed orders.  Not sure if I want to come back here any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=20,2.36,2.32,2.54,,2.336
63,Eren D.,"Belmont, CA",1,13,,2.0,2018-01-05,"We have been to this location over 10 times in the last 2 years, and it had  been an okay experience until today. They were never better or worse than what we expected, so I never thought of writing a review before. But today, they deserved this 2-star review. People who work here do not care that you wait there. They do not explain what's causing the wait, just keep giving stupid excuses. We used the BJ's app to put our name in the waiting list at 5:30pm. Got there at 5:45, with just another party waiting to be seated, and were told that it would take 10 mins for our table to be ready. We were finally seated at 6:18pm, so they wasted a good half an hour of our time waiting at a restaurant that was 20% full. When I asked, they said they were waiting for a table to open, but the back of the restaurant was completely empty except for a few tables.  I asked the host that took us to our table if there was a hold up in the kitchen, which I thought could be one reason to not seat people. In an arrogant way, he pointed at two waiters close by, and said that they have to help all the people in there. So the shortage of waiters should be acceptable by guests, that's the message I got from that. What's funny was the restaurant had at least 5 waiters walking around, and even finding time to joke with each other or get into arguments in front of guests.  We noticed that nobody who helped us was nice, or cared about helping anyone, except for our waiter. The guy who brought out our pizookie basically dropped it off on the edge of the table and left without saying anything. I probably sound like I expect too much from people, but I wouldn't last more than a few months if I had a similar attitude at my job.  Not sure if this place is under new management, but we will try to avoid it for a while. The food is fine but it's just not worth it because of the poor quality of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo,2.4,2.33,2.536,,2.358
228,Eric G.,"Millbrae, CA",0,2,,2.0,2018-01-07,"One and done...I got a $50 gift card for xmas to this place... while the food was good, the service was horrific. It took 2+ hours... food was late and I got my prime rib 20 minutes before my kids got their childrens menu items. I also got my desert before one od my children... WT_!!!!The host could not even make eye contact with the arriving guests and our server apparently has yet to receive any customer service training. If this is a franchise, the owner needs to spend some time there. Several other people walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=20,2.44,2.34,2.532,,2.38
62,Mrs J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,2.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"I would rather wait 30-45 mins for a table, than 30-45 mins for my FOOD! We have tried so hard to give this location hope that it would improve in customer service, turn around times, and wait time, that we have come to visit on 4 separate occasions, and each one just gets worse than the other. Ultimately, we have concluded that the entire staff at BJs is unmotivated to be better at what they do, and at the same time, can't blame them while their leadership team stands around and stares at them.  On this last occasion when we visited on Jan 6th, we arrived at 7:15pm. Waited 15 mins to be seated, and 30 mins for our meals, which arrived at 8:00pm (as I looked at my watch). The server severely lacked any follow through on refilling drinks and updating my family while we waited for food arrival to our table. Once it was delivered, there was no offer to provide condiments, extra napkins, utensils, drink refills, or if there was anything else we wanted to have. Nothing. This is a very similar trend on each visit as well.  Also, when setting new plates of food down on the table, the servers never pick up the empty dish ware that is no longer needed - even the manager noticed this and had to do it herself. Again, another trend in bad training. Although the person in charge that night knew how disappointed I was, it is very sad to know that my displeasure is what it took to actually get this team to start hustling and checking on all of their guests to make sure all was well. That's a shame. This supervisor did come back to the table with me to take over for said unenthused server, but offered no apology for me or the family for having to get up  and leave the table to find her and inconveniencing her to do her job and lead this team. (she was no help), to help rectify this situation. This is leadership immaturity at its finest. Their reaction to my complaint was clearly taken personally, when all they needed to do it resolve the matter on a professional level, and realize that it's not about them, but about the BJs brand. One simple apology would have saved the night. Of course, this was not apparent for this team in Foster City.  After that event, the server was then overly friendly in providing guest service, but by then, it was coming off as the most insincere effort ever. I lost my appetite and just wanted to leave. He offered a box, but I declined. I had no faith that a clean box would have been delivered to me with the prideful and egotistical attitudes I received for calling them out on their horrible guest/customer service. I ended up throwing away a practically full plate of food. Please note that my complaint was sincere, stern, but never offensive. It was difficult for me to comprehend why they had taken my concern so personally. Very odd when your mission is to run a smooth operation. Instead, the server complains about me to the table next to us, and those customers look at me as if I had made the BJs team  do more work than they should have. It was laughable and again, immature on the server's end.  If you see that your customer is upset over something, please take the time to find out why. Don't make it about yourself, because you may not know their story. We had just traveled through hours of long flight delays, and were so hungry when we got home. Our displeasure had nothing to do with anything but fatigue and hunger, but your ""who cares"" attitude just ended any and all hope we had for this store. We may actually return again. However when we do, we hope to see that you have improved in the aspects of morale, organization, turn around times, training, leadership, and overall customer service. I'm not that ""we'll never come back"" person. Experiences like this deserve to be attended to, and the company needs to know. This industry is a very familiar to me, so I intend on making sure you make some changes. We've been to some absolutely wonderful and fantastic BJs restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas. Your store sets them down quite a few notches, which is unfair to the BJs corporation as a whole. Look beyond your walls, and try to see the big picture for the company's success. If you do that, you may just be recognized and rewarded by them as well. How is that not enough incentive and motivation for you? Good luck to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo,2.44,2.31,2.532,,2.362
61,Somphet P.,"San Mateo, CA",365,22,7.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"1 star for this location and BJs mobile app when it comes to customer service experience. 3 stars for the food selection.  I know this review is lengthy and long over due but please bare with me. BE CAREFUL  when using the BJs mobile app to place an order. Even after you've paid ahead of time using the app, the restaurant will see no payment status and therefore will have you pay at the counter; creating a duplicate payment on your order. This occurred on three separate occasions for me while using the BJs app that resulted in duplicate charges on my credit card. After discovering the duplicate transactions two weeks later, I spoke with the store manager and told them of the problem with the mobile app who assured me they would get in touch with their IT department. They also told me the refund could take up to ten business days and to check. After following up with the same manager three times over the course of four weeks with no resolution, I took it up with my creditors and filed a dispute. The way BJs restaurant handled my dispute was unacceptable. Please learn from my experience. Retain your paper recipes from the restaurant because I never received a refund on a credit card payment with a duplicate cash payment made at curb side.  I do hope a manager reads this review alone with a regional manager because I would be happy to discuss this over the phone a fourth time. To this date, BJs restaurant has done nothing to correct the situation regarding my duplicate payments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo,2.44,2.31,2.532,,2.362
79,Maria S.,"Daly City, CA",0,1,,5.0,2018-01-11,So I just wanna voice my opinion about this place for a second. Me my friend and our boyfriend's decide to go out one Friday night and we decide BJ's is the place to be looked busy sounded like a plan. The host Justine was just the sweetest little pregnant girl was really nice got us a table within 10 min of putting our name down. 1st part of great customer service. We decided we were going to play cards against humanity our server Chris came by and was awesome by the way coolest server ever we delt him a hand and as busy as he was with others still made time to deal with us as well. His recommendations were spot on drinks and food couldn't recommend a better server. Ohh and a shout out to Gary his manager who played a card with us. I give this place 5* because the service we got was the best at any BJ's and any restaurant managers should take a play out of chris's playbook to teach others.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo,2.48,2.31,2.548,,2.378
67,T J.,"San Diego, CA",2,9,,2.0,2018-01-11,"I ate at the bar a few times. They have crammed one too many seats at the bar. Can't have a bite without rubbing thighs with strangers. I bet they have no place to put an extra chair, so they have to leave it there.
