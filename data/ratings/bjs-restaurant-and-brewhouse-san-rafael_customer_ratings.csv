250,Matthew C.,"El Verano, CA",30,45,8.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"What an AWESOME place! I went there with my wife on the recommendation of a good friend and we were in for a treat! The place was packed with people waiting so I thought it'd take a while, but they gave us the little buzzy thing, and then seated us within 2 minutes. Again, I thought that since it was packed, our food would take forever, but after we ordered it was brought out in less than 10 minutes! It was extremely delicious, and the atmosphere was great too! Huge TVs on all the walls, and the largest bigscreen I have EVER seen in the middle, must have been 12 feet. I didn't come there to watch TV but it was cool.  We don't drink, but there was tons of beer brewed there, and the staff was extremely friendly and very quick to refill my soda numerous times. Overall, I was VERY impressed. We will certainly go there again when we are in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=280,2.44,2.48,2.48,2.8320000000000003,2.464

The wait staff are slow and not trained on how to really give great customer service. On one occasion it took over 20 mins to get a drink when we were one of maybe 3 tables. The bad service is not just on the waiters either. On another painfully slow occasion we had not been helped for 15 mins and when I looked over to one of the computer terminals, there must have been 3 wait staff and as many managers laughing and joking not paying any attention to the floor.  I actually had to get out of my seat and go ask for service! For as long as BJ's has been open they should have worked out how to properly run the place. It's a shame as it has the potential to be a great place.

They have two outdoor dining sections, and unless you enjoy aggravatingly noisy acoustics they are the only sections that are enjoyable.  Or if you want to watch the big screen sports, then the indoor seating is fine.

362,Osgood F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,,1.0,2012-05-03,"I know going in that this is not going to be a gourmet experience, so I am not disappointed by the food--it is what is is and doesn't pretend to be grand. Sometimes it's horrible and sometimes it's perfectly okay--one just needs to know what to order (stay away from the avocado rolls they promote, they are repulsive; avocados should never feel mushy and hot to the palate). It's the service which is deplorable and I blame management for this.  The service was clearly not designed by anyone who knows anything about the fine art of service.  The person who takes your order should be the one who serves your appetizers, entrees, desserts and the follow through with the check.   There is a preface, a middle and a conclusion--these plot points should be delivered by one person; not a track team passing batons. This way the server feels responsible for his/her clients' well being.  But BJ's implements this idiotic practice of having someone take your order which leads to a mish mash of a cast of characters wandering around aimlessly looking for a home for the dishes they are carrying and by the time they find that home, the homeless food is cold.   Want a good laugh?  Watch poor lost Biff wander around with four plates of food looking for its destination.  It's a comedy of errors if you're in a good mood, but rage inducing if you're starving and grouchy because of it. Then, if the server is lucky enough to find the table, he or she does not know who ordered what and has to ask the patrons which is a big no no.  BJ's flunks basic service 101, and I blame higher management for this, not the servers.   The hostesses are young and indifferent, and don't seem to be candidates for Mensa.  The managers are played by Claude Rains, famous for playing The Invisible Man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=420,2.76,2.55,2.55,2.34,2.6339999999999995
339,America F.,"San Francisco, CA",20,154,2.0,3.0,2012-05-15,I've been there two times and the food sucks really bad. The avocado egg rolls are good. Artichokes deep fried tasted like breaded artichokes you buy in the grocery store in jars.  Last time I went in I had a frozen veggie burger you can get at the grocery store and they messed that up.  Today I went in and ordered a shrimp taco. I was very disappoint not hat I expected at all I was shocked at what was given to me. I took a bite and left it alone that shit was nasty and cold. Don't even get me started on what they gave me with it.  I had a peach virgin margarita that was good but tiny and no refills so I probably wouldn't get it again.  When you walk in the door they are so nice one you get a waiter they can't be found it's like they are avoiding you.  The inside looks so nice like a place you want to go but the food keep me away.  How can you fuck up a taco and frozen food? I hate the food I feel I was ripped off I expect a chain restaurant to have good simple food and they don't.  I won't return it sucked that bad and I feel it was over priced considering how bad the food sucks.

306,b f.,"Larkspur, CA",0,29,,1.0,2012-05-24,"Nasty food! I was wondering if they actually have a kitchen or just a bunch of microwaves. Salad had mushy lettuce. Maybe the salad had been hanging around in the back of the fridge for a few days?  The waitress told us the sodas are brewed on site, sounded great but tasted like syrup with a few cups of added sugar in each glass. Really horrible beyond belief. No the server didn't ask if everything was ok or notice that the sodas weren't consumed by even a quarter of glass.  When we arrived for a very late lunch (around 2:15) the place was quite empty but the hostess was no where around. We waited for at least 5 minutes ---- shoulda' left then. Finally seated. Server came to announce her name and take drink orders. We had to ask what the soup of the day was. Nothing welcoming or inviting about the service, really quite horrible service. Couldn't drink the ultra sweet soda so asked for a glass of water, server didn't ask if anyone else wanted water. Water arrived with food stuff floating in it. Now I'm really starting to feel nauseous, this place is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to food, service, presentation ......  While still eating salad, the server wanted to know if we wanted to order dessert. When we told her no, she brought the check before we had even finished our entree. Do they train these people? There wasn't anyone waiting for our table, there were lots of empty tables.  Manager? Do they have one? What a disgusting experience! Even though I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, nothing made me feel good about the food there. I've had better food at much lower prices in coffee shop chains. BJs Brewhouse should be ashamed.

Other side dishes I've ordered had similar problems.

117,Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2247,2841,1478.0,2.0,2013-01-27,"Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. Probably becuase I grew up in a town where they were the best restuarants around. Sad but true. I remember as a teenager going to Red Lobster was a big deal, and the Olive Garden was the second-best option. So nowadays, having lived in and around San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now San Jose... I definitely have a preference for delicious, less processed, less chain-like places. So I only go to one of these joints when my friends are insistent. Which, today, they were. Don't get me wrong. The food as these joints is usually pretty decent. There are a few items at the Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory chains, in particular, which are guilty pleasures of mine. BJ's has a few of my guilty pleasures on the menu. So I can definitely make do. Two stars for this location, however, because the servers were really inattentive. Like, REALLY inattentive. It was a thirsty day, my friends and I were there a VERY long time (over three hours), and I think we got a total of four check-ins and then had to flag them down for the check. My drink was refilled twice in three hours, and was sitting there empty for half-hour periods of time. Which is definitely sub-par. The food was standard, not bad at all. The setting was fine, just like every other BJ's.

This was 100% totally our fault, so we paid for the meal, and tipped her. We made it to the show, and really enjoyed ourselves.  Afterwards, we made our way back to BJs to pick up our food, which we knew would be absolutely cold by now.  We were starving by this point so we didn't care. When we arrived, we went over to the carry out counter and had planned to just ask them to reheat it for us.  But after hearing our story, Chris (the manager) said 'Oh! We can't let you have this food - we'll remake it for you... please have a seat in the bar.' The food was remade, fresh - with no charge.  The service was excellent.  I am usually disappointed by chain places, but these folks really went out of the way to make the meal enjoyable for us.  Thank you, BJ's for making the night so great - we def need to get out of the city more --the Northbay has a down-home vibe that I can really appreciate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=200,2.64,2.59,2.59,2.58,2.6100000000000003

I'm not a huge BJ's fan but we really enjoyed our food and the service last night. Gabriel B was our server and he was great! He recommended the black and blue burger for the bf and my boyfriend said it was one of the best things he's eaten at BJ's for sure. Gabriel had great timing (made sure we were taken care of but wasn't over-attentive), was funny and gave us probably the quickest service I've ever gotten at a BJ's without making us feel like he was slammed and needed to attend to his other tables. And it was a busy Friday night! I kid you not we got our appetizer like four minutes after we ordered it and it was piping hot. Entrees were also very speedy and drinks were brought to us promptly.  My boyfriend is a server in SF and I worked in fine dining in LA so we recognize quality service when we see it. I totally understand some of the poor reviews on here about bad service so I guess it depends on the server you get.

We would think of BJ's when we wanted a nice dinner. But the accountant's and consultants have nibbled away at all of the reasons why we liked the place. They have replaced the tables and chairs with booths. Good for them - maximizes seating space. Bad for us. They're awkward and just plain uncomfortable. The menu changes are more subtle. The salad dressings went from thick home-made to watery out of a bottle - in ever-smaller portions. The burgers have gone from a loose ground sirloin to a pre-made frozen patty consistency. Tasty menu items like sweet potato fries have disappeared. The menu is crowded with items that are suspiciously similar to most of the other chains - one wonders if they are sharing suppliers or just consultants. Good for them, I'm sure these moves save a lot of money.  The service? No complaints really. The staff know their jobs and it seems as if the kitchen is well managed. Food is fast and orders are accurate. Hmmm. Where else have I seen that? That place with Yellow arches I think...

The food was even better!  The spinach artichoke dip was probably the best I have had since I moved to the west coast.  It wasn't too salty and it was creamy and cheesy, just the way I like it!  I might order that as my meal next time.  I ordered a loaded potato and the Mac n cheese small plate for my meal.  I can't say enough good things about the food.

I've eaten here a couple dozen times since they opened and ordered take out at least a dozen times and always had good meals and good service (once we had a large party and the service was terrible). However, I've been out of town for 6 months and I have no idea what happened here in that time but the food is absolutely awful.  First off, the menu changed and all of my regular favorites were gone...pot roast, meat loaf, sweet potato fries. I was persuaded to try the chicken pasta with cream sauce and it was just nasty...I've had much better meals at Denny's. The Chicken was burnt and the sauce...yuk, yuk, yuk...definitely not home made...came straight out of a bag or can and into a microwave. The friend I was with had a NY steak (because her fav was gone too) and the steak was tough and had a lot of fat. I've seen the negative reviews for the service here but in the past I always seemed to get good service. Many times I've left $20 tips for a $50 or $60 meal because the service was great. But this time we had a kid helping us that had absolutely no clue what he was doing. The place wasn't very busy and I had to ask him twice for the wine. And I knew the menu better than he did. Anyway, I chalked this up to one bad day, and that can happen anywhere. Definitely giving the place another chance. Which happened today...and now I won't ever go back.  I ordered take out...got my favorite teriyaki chicken plate with rice and veggies and an appetizer of chicken pot stickers. The sauce for the pot stickers was different...way too salty. And the chicken plate had very few veggies and chicken...mostly rice. I'd rather have had the chicken bowl they serve at Jack in the Box. Honest to God. And for the $25, I could have had 3 or 4 of them. I don't know if the management at this place reads the reviews or even cares, but I can tell you first hand the place has gone downhill...and fast. It used to be my go to place and now I will never go here again. If I ever end up here by chance, the only thing I would order is the pizza.  Whoever runs this place needs to wake up...you've lost a good customer because your food went from good to lousy.

But while looking around there were quite a number of tables/booths available. I asked one of the many hostesses if we could seat ourselves, because she gave us a wait time of 10-15 minutes. And then she graciously explained it is the policy to be taken to our table. Really? Because there were more people waiting to be seated than were actually eating! Moving on...we ordered and 34 minutes later our food arrived. We ordered: Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (there were 5) $5.25. They were so shiny...greasy with cheese, nothing else. It arrived with our main course and were at room temperature.  Mini Pizza, Chicken Bacon Ranch $10.95. I do not suggest the deep dish for a mini pizza, as suggested by our server. Its all crust. This, too, was a room-temperature dish. Parmesan Chicken $14.95 The description and the actual plate of food in front me greatly differed. It described a parmesan chicken with a lemon, butter, chardonnay sauce. But there was no sauce. The broccoli had white ""dry"" spots on it as if it were cooked after having freezer burn. I asked the waitress if my dish came with this sauce, it did. The server said the sauce must have soaked into the chicken...Ya, that happens if it sits a while, I'm sure because SURPRISE it was not hot at all. All I've heard is that BJ's has great beer. So don't get your hopes set on a nice dinner.  My last comment, after the appetizers and dinner were presented on the table, our server quickly left us to eat. But we had to table settings. No napkin. No fork and knife. After a few minutes we flagged her at another table and asked for flatware. The table across from us flagged her and asked for their silverware. Hmmmm? Really. So not impressed. The servers are spread thinly in their sections so food will be delivered cold, there will be no silverware and good luck waiting to be seated.

172,Jerry M.,"San Rafael, CA",2,6,,2.0,2014-03-30,"The new BJ's restaurant in San Rafael has been open for less than 6 months, and is still showing some rough edges one would associate with any full-service restaurant starting from scratch.  And yet I'm puzzled how the local BJ's has been unable to solve some of their staffing issues even after 6 months. Economic times are tough, and there are surely dozens of applicants for every job opening.  When Kohl's department store advertised for job applicants at their new store at San Rafael's Northgate Mall -- the same location as BJ's -- they had long lines of eager people, looking for work. The menu at BJ's is a wonderful fusion of brew-pub food mixed with Asian and Italian specialties -- offering an amazingly broad range of exciting tastes.  The issue in San Rafael isn't the menu: it's certainly got to do with an inexperienced front-of-house staff that just can't seem to stay focused on the basics of getting the orders correct, serving them while still hot, and remembering small details. I don't know if the problem of inexperience is in the kitchen as well, but I'd have to assume so -- BJ's seems to go for younger staff members with little or no prior restaurant experience. We were invited to a pre-opening private ""dress rehearsal"" meal (at no charge, except for drinks) as a result of my active participation in the San Rafael Chamber of Commerce.  My wife, a close friend, and I had a really good brew-pub meal, enjoying a wide spectrum of items.  We met some of the executive staff.  Service was timely, carefully orchestrated, and surprisingly good for a brand-new operation. Subsequent visits to BJ's revealed deeper problems that the General Manager and his key people were having with the inexperienced staff.  We've been back to BJ's four times since the pre-opening festivities, and things don't seem to be improving. On our most recent visit, this past Saturday evening, we arrived early in evening service, and were shown to our table promptly, even though we had no reservation.  The first thing I noticed were the employees who were hosts for the evening -- four young women, with nothing productive to do -- so they do what anyone would expect -- chat among themselves.  It took the four some minutes to decide where they would seat us. Our server was attentive and courteous, if overly solicitous.  We ordered our drinks.  My wife's coffee came promptly, but my cocktail order seemed to take an inordinately long time.  The server brought it only after I reminded her that I was waiting for it, when she came to ask if we had any questions for her, and were we ready. I've had this exact same experience at this BJ's before.  The bar service seems out of sync with the ordinary idea that drinks are served promptly when ordered, not after a random delay, ending only when the server is prompted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=180,2.28,2.68,2.588,2.12,2.52

That said, we've been here more times than I'd like to think. They have an enormous menu, which is a red flag itself. How can a kitchen give personal care to enough different items to fill about ten pages? It can't. But, be fair, this is a mall chain restaurant. Nobody's expecting anything special. But, how about something that doesn't taste goopy and sweet? Stick to the burger. They can't mess that up too badly. They seem quite proud of there own beer, which is mediocre at best, but they do offer a good selection of other independent beers. That's good. And while I'm at it, the TVs and attempt to be a sports bar is kind of a joke. There are a lot of TVs, but they are way high up, very far away and all have the sound off.

Everyone acts like they hate their jobs and have something better to do. Everyone is on their cell phones or chatting instead of checking back or refilling drinks. The food takes forever and so do the drinks- even if it's just water. Then we have the food. The soups and salads are the only consistent thing. Everything else is truly hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's really bad and again, takes almost an hour on a Saturday night?! Get it together. Then we have management. On the one occasion a manager had to come to our table because a friend of ours asked to speak with them after being brought the food prepared wrong twice, she was so unbelievably rude. Rolling her eyes, huffing and puffing, seeming like we were inconveniencing her. She then walked over to her staff and we were within earshot sitting close by and she just starts yelling at them.

My group and I walked in on a Sunday night, the place was busy but not too busy with plenty of open tables and a short wait.  We were seated and then waited a full fifteen or more minutes to simply be approached by a waitress, and that was only after a very kind man sitting in the table next to us complained FOR US to the management. After complaining, it still took another 5 or 7 minutes before we were served water. Water. Something that's usually given to you within the first five minutes of walking in.  Our waitress's only response was that they were short staffed, which I understand and am sympathetic toward. Clearly it's also a management problem. As others have said before, if this place is short staffed on a Sunday night (not a super busy night but not quiet either), then they need to hire more waiters. I think I would hate being here on actual busy days. Usually BJs run like well oiled machines, this one ran like the rusty, spluttering car that's now sitting in your grandpas garage. Besides the subpar service, the food was also sub par compared to what I'm used to getting at a BJs. Our flatbread appetizer was disgustingly soggy. Had we not been so hungry by this time, we probably would have sent it back.  Our entrees were pretty bland, flavorless and doused with oil (clearly BJs is not the place to go if you're watching what you eat, but I've never had food this oily here either). Perhaps it's just those items we ordered. Be what it may, I'm not willing to go back and give it another chance anytime soon.

Since it was my wife's birthday, she was told that she was entitled to a free Pizookie.  She order hers and someone else ordered dessert.  After 10-12 minutes no Pizookie and no other dessert.  Alas,  no waitress.  At this point I asked for the manager and complained about this lack of service.  He stated that it takes 10 minutes to make a Pizookie.  If this was the case, we should have been told.  Having been in the chefless restaurant business I was also aware that the desserts were premade and just needed to be reheated.  I asked for the check and was told we would be comped for the meal.  While I appreciated this courtesy, I would never return to BJ's in Northgate Mall.  It certainly cast a cloud over my wife's birthday dinner.

The Northgate location doesn't look like that and it's kind of hard to find if you're inside the mall because the map is a little off. When I lived by their Tukwila location it was my favorite place! I was so surprised to find a BJ's when I was passing through the NorthGate mall in San Rafael so I really wanted to eat there. My husband and I went around 3pm on Sunday. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Our table had water on it and I sat on a small piece of what I think was a french fry (my fault for not looking but if it's slow, you have time to wipe down your booth).  It took what felt like 10 minutes to just get the waiter to come and introduce himself and then another minute to get water. For such a slow afternoon, for anytime actually, I expect slightly faster service. Even when it's packed at any other restaurant it only takes a few minutes before someone comes to your tables ""Hi, I'm XX, I'll be taking care of you this evening.."" Our appetizers took about another 10 minutes and then our food came.. But I noticed that the people who sat next to us, who came before us, didn't get their food yet. It was a couple and two small children. They got their food when we were half way done with ours. If I were them I'd be really annoyed. We shared calamari and corn fritters which were super delicious. My husband had the parmesan chicken with just mashed potatoes and I had the parmesan chicken sandwich with tick fries. The sandwich was alright.. His food was way better and the mashed potatoes were kinda cheesy. It was so good! This place has dim lighting and a sporty feel with the televisions around.

363,An G.,"Oceanside, CA",2,12,,1.0,2014-09-01,"Where to begin. First I will say we have dined at many BJs locations and this was by far the worst and not up to the standard I was expecting. It's normally really good. This location would be closed where I come from. We were seated right away, which is good because that has never happened at any BJs I've been to (normally they are crazy busy), but bad because the place was empty (not a good sign). Though our waitress was really nice, we waited 10 minutes before we even got an acknowledgment. Finally we ordered drinks and food, 25 minutes later we got it. I ordered the Lemon Thyme chicken. Though the chicken was not dry, overall the food was not good quality. Everyone else had the opinion of ""meh"" on their food as well. No flavor, extra salty and blah/burnt. Though they are known for the pizza, not entrees. Service was uber slow (even though the place was empty). Add to that my daughter got lemonade that had no ice and was so warm, with condensation on the lid, I questioned if it had been sitting on the patio in the sun all day. It was 90 today. When we tried to return it for a new one, the same one was brought back with ice. The bottom of the drink was still warm, (imagine, hot lemonade).

245,Kai M.,"San Anselmo, CA",92,14,,1.0,2014-09-10,"This is the message that I sent to BJ's corporate offices as I could not find the local manager's email address. I was completely appalled at the lack of attention from my server, Joel.  Several times, he walked past my table and asked the one across from me if they needed anything and the one next to it.  However, he did not notice that the drink that I ordered was sitting barely touched and I did not have any water, nor was I ever offered water.  When my food came out, it was brought by a runner and I had to ask her if she would send my server over.  I then asked that he take my drink back and adjust it by adding orange juice (it was too strong for me).  He did that and when he came back I asked that he take my steak back as well because I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was.  I asked for medium well, which apparently looks different depending on the establishment.  He took the food back, albeit with a bit of an annoyed look.  He advised that it would take 10-12 minutes to make it well done and I was ok with that.  The only good thing that he did was actually update me on it twice.  I went to the bathroom and my food came out and was left on the table...not a problem. But, I never saw my server again.  After a while, a woman asked if I was ok and I said that I was ready for my check.  I had wanted to get dessert but, the experience had been so poor up to this point that I decided against it.  She brought my check, I put my credit card in the folder and she did not come back.  I had to get up to go to the host station and ask that they close out my check. It is absolutely ridiculous that a server would not offer water, come back and make sure my drink was ok, my food was ok, and upon having to leave, advise that he was going home and who would continue my table service.  And, there is no reason that I should have spent so much time waiting for someone's attention in a fairly empty restaurant. In addition, when my new steak was brought out, it was obvious that they served me the same mound of potatoes that they took away with the first plate.  I had taken two bites out of that mound and that is what was brought back to me 10-12 minutes later.  They tried to camouflage it by adding additional brussel sprouts.  But, I was served lukewarm food that had sat under the hot lamps rather than a fresh scoop of potatoes and brussel sprouts along with the new steak that was also a bit warm.   Overall, a terrible experience.  Absolutely terrible!  And, some server training should be in order for Joel and any others that think this was acceptable. For the first time in my life, I was reduced to leaving absolutely no tip.  Usually, even with less than par service, I leave 10% but, in this case, I couldn't see any reason to leave even a penny.

A friend and I went to BJs at northgate tonight and not only were we rudely greeted at our table, told that kitchen closed at 10:30 (when it actually closed at 11), but when we received our meal, it was upsetting. We opted to receive our full meal altogether (dessert and all) which wasn't a problem, but there was no chicken on the grilled chicken pasta, we ordered the mini pazookies and received full size (which we weren't looking to pay for), and then there was the french fry fiasco. We ordered a side of fries with our meal and it didn't come out, so when our server came to check on us she said they'd be right out with them. 5 minutes later she came to check on us again and said that she's so sorry they hadn't come out and she'd take them off the bill for us (which I assumed meant that we'd still receive them and she take the charge off for our inconvenience). After 10 more minutes of waiting AND our server dropping the bill, my friend approached the server and asked if we were still getting our fries, to which she rudely replied, ""No, we don't have any.""

The staff was friendly, professional and attentive.  This was true throughout my entire dining experience. The ambiance is warm and comfortable.  There are lots of TV's but, thankfully, the audio was turned down.  There is quite a bit of seating.  There is also a bar area.   The high ceilings give the space an open feel.  There are lots of wooden accents that help in providing a familiar and pleasant environment. The meal flowed at a nice pace. I was neither left waiting or overly rushed. I enjoyed all of my food. BJ's Fritos Nachos (Piranha Pale Ale Chili, crispy Fritos Corn Chips and Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip topped with shredded cheddar cheese, jalapenos, Applewood smoked bacon, sour cream, diced tomatoes and green onions.) - These were quite good.  The fresh ingredients were crisp and added a bit of lightness.  There were lots of Jalapenos but they were rather mild.  I would not have minded some slightly hotter peppers.  The cheese was fully melted.  I do think these would be even better if the chili was a tad more complex in flavour. It was a bit flat.  But overall, I really liked them.    Brewhouse Double Deluxe (Two 5 oz., fresh 100% USDA Angus beef patties, Applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, crispy onion strings, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and BJ's signature burger sauce.) This was a pretty darn good burger.  The only real weakness was it had a pretty decent case of the soggy bottom bun blues.  But, it managed to hold together long enough for me to eat it.  The burger was cooked just right to the medium rare I requested.  The onion strings were a great crispy addition.  The bacon was tasty and perfectly cooked.  There was lots of nicely melted cheese.  The vegetables were fresh. This is a big burger with all of the fixin's. I also liked the fries.  They were crisp and there was just the right amount of salt.  Receipt (big dinner for one):  $20.61   Overall - Great service and a comfortable space combined with a tasty app and a very good burger to make for a very enjoyable dining experience.  For me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in San Rafael was a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=100,1.92,2.4,2.476,2.6399999999999997,2.208

They both have similar menu items, burgers, pizzas, salads, etc. with beer at BJ's and cheesecake at CF the primary differentiators.

Then one we placed a drinks and apps order it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks and another 15 minutes to get the apps. So if we are counting we have been siting for approx 45 minutes with no dinner.

It began to taste better as the ice melted. As as the meal progressed, our dinner finally arrives and his wonderful bacon cheese burger has hardly any cheese and little bacon but plenty of pickles and is well over cooked. and I ordered the atlantic salmon. the veggies were cooked to mush and the salmon wasn't cooked in the middle, but at least it was warm. Only the ends were actually cooked, so at least i was able to east those.

We told him that he needed to work nights because all of the servers at night are lacking everything that he rocked. With Jeffrey we didn't feel like he was only working there temporarily to pay his way through whatever his current situation is. It's funny how service can really make or break the experience for the customer.  Unfortunately we went back Saturday night and it was awful. Our cocktails were juice. Literally no alcohol. Charge me for juice then, not an alcoholic beverage if you are not going to put any alcohol in it!. It took us two hours to get our food, and drinks. No joke.

Even though we were early, and there were no big games, it was pretty packed. Yelp says the noise level is ""average"" -- true, if average is a dull roar. It was definitely loud in there. BJ's seems to be a cross between a sports bar and a family restaurant, and judging by the quite varied demographics eating here, they are pulling it off. Big-screen TVs line both walls the length of the restaurant, not just above the bar. This actually is kinda cool: I liked checking out the A's game at points during dinner. So even though we are not typical sports bar people, other than the noise, it wasn't a bad experience. The true surprise was the food: it was both reasonable and quite good. They actually had one of my favorite meals, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, and they pulled it off. The chowder was excellent and the bread was freshly delicious. My wife had Mediterranean tacos, and thought they were quite good aside from the cilantro. My clam chowder bowl was $9 and the Mediterranean tacos were $9.50.

66,Melissa B.,"San Rafael, CA",59,118,129.0,3.0,2015-06-10,"I find myself at BJ's more often than I'd like to admit, simply because they have a lot of TVs, which always play the big games that are on, and they have beer. The fact that they have a ton of different types of food to choose from adds to the fact that it's just a win-win situation when you need a TV, food, and beer. Other than that, BJ's really disappointed me last night. I went with a friend and we had just a 15 minute wait for a table, which was totally find because it was a busy game night. We got a beer at the bar and the bartender was great, and closed our tab before we went to our table. No complaints there. Our server though, awful. He walked up to us about 5-10 minutes after sitting down and goes, ""are you ready?"" I literally said, ""ready for what?"" Food.... Drinks... The game? Are you our server? Do you have a name? I've never NOT been introduced or at least told the name of my server before I've ordered my food. We took a few more minutes to decide and then another girl comes up to us and asks if we are ready to order. Did we change servers? We order about 2 times each because she was having a hard time hearing us-- and yes, it was super loud because of the game. About 10 minutes later they bring out my meal and then probably 5 minutes later my friends comes. But I got a sandwich and she got soup so I'm not sure why there was such a big gap in between but oh well. That really wouldn't have mattered if it was a good experience other than that. I wasn't offered ketchup or mustard and my friend had to track down one of our servers to get some. I'm also a little confused why my first beer was $4 at the bar and then my second beer was $5.75 at the table when I ordered them about 20 minutes apart. Did happy hour end in those 20 minutes or did I just pay $1.75 for him to walk my beer to the table? We finished eating and had to track them down again to ask for our bill. After we had paid I even had to ask for a box, which they never offered me even though I had half of my meal left in front of me the whole time.  Anyways, there are some times I go to BJs and have service that I think is normal, and I totally get that sometimes it's busy and you won't be waited on the whole time by your waitress/waiter, but that was just pretty lame and sub-par in my opinion. And the fact that we realized we had two servers because the woman was getting trained made me feel awful for her because she should NOT be getting trained by that guy. He could have probably introduced her as well, to start off. Most employees here are really nice and have good customer service but maybe someone needs to make their rounds and check things out because some people there have 0 personality and 0 customer service and if that's the case, I'd rather go somewhere else because it's pretty distracting from a good meal and good beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=80,2.64,2.38,2.516,2.444,2.484

Without fail, every time we go to BJ's, whether they are dead or packed, the servers take a long time to even address you and bring water. Then they food takes at least 45 minutes to come out after you place order with the server even if it's a salad. The worst part is they don't know how to treat their customers. The wait staff seems annoyed and uptight, again, every time we go, no matter who we see. One time my brother checked in about why his side cesar salad never made it out but mine had (they should have came together, not him having to check in 15 minutes after mine arrived), and the server had the audacity to tell him she's not responsible for bringing out the food, the runner is!!! OMG woman, you are our server! You are the one who is supposed to make sure we have what we need! Then another time, all the adult meals came out but the kids meals didn't show up until 8 minutes later. Anybody who has worked in a restaurant knows kids meals always come out first, feed the little monsters, their hungry! How hard is it to make a grilled cheese! Seriously, this place always messes up orders, has rude servers (not so much the hostess's), whines and gruffs when you remind them you need a drink refill, water refill or something was messed up on the order. BJ's needs to teach their servers etiquette 101. Only reason my family and I go back is for the food. The cooks do a great job! My tips (or lack their of) reflect how a server performs.

79,Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,279,8.0,5.0,2015-07-05,"One can always start a circuitous argument about the following: What is a better restaurant - one that is family-run and has been around forever, or someplace that is quite obvious a chain? As with pretty much everything else, there is no simple answer. Fittingly enough, on consecutive nights we experienced both. And while our sample was in no way definitive, it did highlight why certain classic family-style joints might be in trouble, whereas a well-run if somewhat soulless corporate chain can do well.  The restaurant we went to the night before has been around since 1973, but in many ways seems to have not advanced past 1987 - no new items on the menu, no website or any acknowledgements that the Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama era has ever taken place. On the other hand, you can tell that BJ's really keeps on top of everything - the menu reflects the range of tastes that its guests demand, one can bring in a coupon via smartphone, televisions are attuned to a healthy variety of sporting events. And, possibly most importantly, the staff is fresh and invigorating - I don't think we ever had to wait more than a couple of minutes. And our food - words can not describe how tasty my New Orleans Jambalaya was, but it went down easily and made my belly nice and content, accompanied by a nice, smooth Piranha Ale. And for dessert, the Salted Caramel Pizookie ensured that I wouldn't be needing any food for the next twenty hours.  Although we were there for nearly ninety minutes, the joint was efficient enough to make it feel like nine - yes, I know that not all chain restaurants are like this, I know that the food isn't necessarily the best for you, and probably somewhere there is a man being shortchanged on his bean profit.

We could've gone to our usual BJ's but it was a bit out of the way. I really wish we went to that one instead - considering that we're basically regulars and we've never had a terrible experience.  This BJ's seriously sucked. When we walked in, the host kinda looked at us like we needed to leave. We got there an hour before they closed, so I'm not sure what that was about. When she took us to our table, she basically just plopped down the menus and weakly said, ""Have a nice day."" Okay. Fine. Our server came by later on and I thought he was decent but something about him seemed off. I ordered the spaghetti marinara and he asked me if I wanted to add meat. I politely told him no but it looked like he thought it was funny that I only wanted noodles and sauce. Sorry, I currently do not eat meat? Anyway, our food came out like half an hour later. The wait didn't bother me because there were interesting activities going on in the restaurant to look at, so yeah. The guy who dropped off our food basically did what the host did - plopped the plates down and left. I was disappointed when I didn't see garlic bread on both of our plates because we both ordered pasta and the menu said that all pasta dishes came with garlic bread. We ended up asking our main server for it. After that, we kinda stopped seeing him for a while. Like, where did you go, man. When we were done eating, he was about to drop off our check but I guess some old friends came in at the same time. They were seated right next to us and we heard him having a full-on conversation with them for a while. It took him about 5 minutes to walk like 3 steps to drop it off. I understand that you miss them and all but we had to go and it was already close to midnight. As soon as we got the check, we immediately paid and set it out so that he would know that we were ready to go. Nope, still had to have a great conversation with his friends. I guess he saw how irritated I was because I was facing him, so he finally took the check and gave it back immediately. Overall, the service sucked the most. It would've been nice if the employees acted like they were happy to be there. At least acted like it. It also would've been nice if our server excused himself from the conversation to let us go. The food was okay, but it was something I couldn't have too much of because it got annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=180,2.56,2.43,2.504,2.084,2.482

Never had a bad pizza at any BJ's. This one just happens to be close to where I live now. I have been here a lot of times. I'm always fantasizing about the pizza when I arrive but then I start looking at the menu and something on page 23 catches my attention.... bad idea. I've ordered a lot of different stuff here and basically I regret not getting the pizza every time. I love their pepperoni pizza. It was a bit greasy the last time I had it but hey, you don't eat pizza because it's healthy. We eat it because it tastes good. That's why I gave them 2 stars. That and the Pizookie. Of course. I was with a party of 3 and we order the pizookie sampler. It was just perfect. The portions were much more reasonable for 3. They were 3 smaller ones and you could pick the flavor for each one.         The service is not great. Last time we were there the server had to go ask her manager questions for us that she didn't have the answer to. Simple stuff like for example the yelp check in deal. It's a discount off your bill and she was utterly confused when we showed it to her. I see this often in different places though.  A lot of times the employees have never heard of the deal or even yelp for that matter and they didn't know about it because someone (who should have) didn't educate them on it. That's fine but she literally had to go back and ask for us like 3 or 4 times about different things that she should've known more about. When we presented her with our check in deal, she had to go ask her mgr about it. She came back with a form for their frequent buyer program. We asked her if we needed to sign up for it to get the check in deal and she had to check with her mgr. She came back again and said no then on our bill there was an option to get a $5 coupon if you donate at least $1 to some charity. We signed up for the program and donated $2, Then we asked her how we get our $5 coupon and she had no idea what $5 coupon we were talking about. She had to go ask the mgr.  It's not her fault that she was just not properly informed about certain things.

Secondly, don't send the waitress over to talk to the 16yr old. Talk to the adult that addressed the issue with you in the first place. Disgusting! Will not return!

It's menu is extensive ranging from deep dish pizza all the way to low calorie items as well. So if you're looking for a restaurant and not exactly sure what you're in the mood for this place is a great stop because there will be something that entices you.  Personal favorite; I'm a big fan of the brisket burger. If you do enjoy burgers I recommend this one first (not for the novice eaters). Plus all burgers come with your choice of sides and I usually lean towards the seasoned wedges.  Also if you are a beer drinker this place has its own brew house with so many good tasting beers. They also offer the sampler of four beers if you can't decide. And to top it off the main reason I go there is for the famous Pizookie! This dessert is one of the tastiest treats I have ever gotten to taste and it comes in multiple flavors. All in all this place has a little of everything and I have had good service there as well.

We went in around 1045/11AM for an early lunch... I had a free appetizer coupon and we got calamari. How can you go wrong with calamari. The dipping sauce that came with the dish was pretty watery and overall weak... I don't know whether they decided to make their portions a bit smaller or if there isn't anymore calamari in the sea lol.  For entrees I had initially ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus dish. When I had a mouthful of the pasta... I was underwhelmed.  I'm not trying to be harsh here, I COMPLETELY understand this is a chain and not a 3-star michelin star restaurant, but I mean it had little to no seasoning and very very little sauce...  I think I had like 5 asparagus's and 6-7 shrimps for a FULL plate of pasta. After trying to take a third bite I had enough. I decided to order the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. That dish is beyond good!!! I had never felt like LICKING my plate except when my mother cooks...  Definitely will be ordering THAT again. As for my mom, she ordered the California chicken club and she was pleased. The fries were nice and thin... Definitely better than any fries I've had in a while (except inn&out fries lol) Overall I had an GREAT lunch at BJ's! Made a mistake on my end for choosing the wrong plate first, but luckily my waiter was kind enough to take it off our bill. We were be stopping in from time to time for calm chowder, calamari (if they up the portion) and their fish entrees for sure !!!!! Jan 5, 2017 The portions have significantly gotten smaller. Ordered the Atlantic Salmon and like you can see, the rice and mashed potatoes were smaller in size. I had to tell the waitress if she could garnish the salmon with herbs and sauce (came with none). Rice was undercooked and a piece of the salmon was overdone. My boyfriend loved his dish and convinced me to tip the waitress well over 20%, so I did. Sure wish I had a bit more food on my plate. Already miss the 2016 portions lol. Jan 12, 2017 Tonight's visit to BJ's' absolutely worth mentioning. Sayra was our waitress for the evening. Once our food came out from the kitchen and onto our table, I noticed that I didn't have the Steak Cut Fries I had ordered. Instead of taking my dish to redo the fries, she told me to ""keep it"" and she'll put in an order for the fries I wanted.  Most of the time they'll (waitresses and waiters) take the dish and remake it. The customer (I) will end up waiting while the mistake they made is corrected. Ultimately ruining the experience of ""dining together."" It's happened to me a number of times and although I acknowledge slip ups... it sucks.   Sayra brought out the fries I wanted and all was good. She deserved well over the suggested 20% tip. It's people like this that keep you coming back. No attitude, excellent customer service and all smiles!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,2.48,2.62,2.6,1.9640000000000002,2.564

I was really satisfied with my kale and Brussels sprouts salad with balsamic vinaigrette and lots of veggies. I shared a churro pazookie (a bunch of mini churros topped with vanilla ice cream) with the table for dessert which was a great treat.

But our last visit shows that there is a trend in BJs, her it what we figured: Since the last several years the food variety at BJs has changed dramatically. In our opinion to the worst. We started visiting BJs couple years ago. The menu was almost Upscale Restaurant style, with good food choices like Grilled PorkChops, with Mustard and Apple Sauce. And this wasn't your regular Mustard or Apple sauce it was a high quality home made style condiment. This has all gone, and today BJs is there where it maybe belongs all the time: offering and serving Bar Food.  If we wouldn't had experienced those great offers in the last years, we surely would not complain, cause you get what you can expect here. But we are just so disappointed cause we saw what BJs has been capable off. I don't know if they have a new Food Director, but we will continue to going down on our visit frequency.

455,chris c.,"San Rafael, CA",7,19,,1.0,2017-09-03,"Earlier tonight I had my second bad experience at this restaurant, and I'd like to write up why I'm not going back.  The short of it:  I just paid full price for food I didn't eat, and my gf and I ended up sharing her food. Pitiful. Date night, 9:30pm.  We arrived to a half empty restaurant and full waiting area.  The hostess eventually got to us and then seated us about 5 minutes later.  We'd requested a specific type of table (many of them available) and the hostess apologized for forgetting when we reminded her after she tried to seat us at the table we'd specifically requested she avoid.  No biggie, but not a good start. It took 15-20 minutes for our server to get to us, and we ordered drinks and entrees in one go.  The poor lady was doing her best to cover a huge number of people, and she apologized for the ""ridiculous wait."" Our food was dropped off about ten to fifteen minutes later.  My girlfriend got some burger thing that was pretty good.  I got a California Club, and it was  gloppy with cheese, soggy with something else, limp and yet also stale/overwarmed, and somehow still lacking in flavor.  I decided to send it back and have them refire it or send out something else, but alas, I wouldn't see my server again for 25-30 minutes, and every attempt at waving her or another incredibly overworked server down went unheeded.  I had some of my fries but hardly touched the club sandwich, and ended up eating some of my gf's burger.  Super rude of me, but I was hungry and had waited long enough. Eventually my server came back, about ten to fifteen minutes after we'd finished, and asks if we need a box in addition to the check.  I said we didn't need a box because it was bad, pointing to my nearly untouched sandwich.  She disappears for a good while before picking up my card and charging the full amount for the meal. After I've paid she finally asks what wasn't great, and we told her. She later offers to bring us a cookie dessert, but dinner was already well past over for my gf and I still hadn't had a real meal, so we declined.  We'd been there forever.  Meanwhile, the only other table in earshot, apparently also on a date, was letting the server know that they never did get one of their two entrees, and that they had to share, too. It was when we got up to leave that a server, moving super quickly, almost knocked over my girlfriend.  That sort of thing happens, but he didn't apologize or even slow down. I believe in providing feedback to businesses, so I quietly went to find a manager. When he came out to talk with me I told him a very brief account of what had happened, and also pointed out that their hostess station had been unmanned for the last five minutes and that there was a huge line.  He apologized but didn't really ask for specifics.  Nor did he offer to comp anything.  I would have refused the comp, I just wanted to get out of there, but when a customer tells you that he didn't actually eat dinner because his food was so bad and didn't have a chance to let anyone know because his server was AWOL, it's pretty crazy to think it's OK to charge full price for something not really delivered.   The guy admitted ""yeah, tonight has been kind of a disaster,"" and I do feel bad for everyone involved because they appeared to be trying hard and doing their best, but the whole thing was unacceptable.  Date night ruined and I'm out cash for food I didn't eat.  Customers waiting to check in started leaving after the hostess still hadn't shown up, and I sort of envy them.  At least they're not out way too much cash and time.

When I was finally ""greeted"" I was told that they had not even started making half of my order because they didn't know what kind of pizza I wanted (when I clearly ordered a gluten free cheese pizza) but the other half was available. Excuse me? The mobile app makes you add a phone number, so why wasn't I contacted about my order? If that wasn't enough, it was gonna take an additional 15 minutes for the pizza to be made. It took a total of 10 minutes for me to even pay for my order. Once I FINALLY paid, I asked the ""waitress"" how long I would have to wait for the pizza and she laughed. Are you kidding me? The manager came over, never offered me anything, didn't apologize. Nothing. I work in this mall. It's ridiculous that this is the kind of service they provide.

31,Monica A.,"Union City, CA",6,2,3.0,1.0,2017-11-21,"What an awful experience. We came here for a nice company lunch and it was not what we expected. We thought we would be conserving time if we ordered online because we can also make our modifications online. But clearly that did not make our trip better. It doesn't matter if you order online, they don't start the food until you get there. While I understand this, all of our modifications weren't even taken into account. A couple coworkers got their orders wrong. There was a salad that was with no cheese that came with cheese. A chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only that came with pickles and mustard only. Two burgers that were not cooked properly. The picture above shows a burger that should have been medium well but instead looked and was completely raw!!!! There was no point in ordering online when they literally messed up 60% of our orders. When we told the manager what was wrong, he was upset that we had ordered online! What's the point of having that option then!!! Needless to say, we will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,2.2,2.43,2.472,,2.3380000000000005
16,Rose J.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,2.0,2017-12-09,"First off I want to say our Waiter was awesome!  After making an appointment 1 month before, upon getting to the restaurant we were told that they were not ready for us and that we would have to wait.  It took them 50 minutes to get ready and then seat us.  (Really? we had a reservation! You new we were coming)  Upon ordering appetizers and our meals. Our meals came out before the appetizers.  Food was missing from 4 of the people sitting with us.  It took the kitchen another 30-40 minutes to get them their meals.  The Manager never came over to apologize for the problem, however our waiter was on top of it all and very apologetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20,2.12,2.42,2.476,,2.3
15,Lexi A.,"Grants Pass, OR",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-09,I've never even eaten here. I just waited 20 minutes to be seated while every group that came in after me was seated before me.

30,Bill J.,"Petaluma, CA",0,58,1.0,1.0,2017-12-17,"Since this is brewpub I expected some decent beer. Oddly they didn't have any Pilsner other than Heineken. So we ordered it. The beer arrived completely flat with no head or carbonation whatsoever. Anybody serving beer should have immediately noticed it. We wanted to bring it to the attention of the waiter but he was nowhere to be found. It took quite a while to hunt him down. He finally brought a Stella to replace the Heineken. It was also flat. I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare. It arrived rare with an odd red color and appeared to have been brought up to a lukewarm temperature under a heat lamp. The horseradish was forgotten. Since a busboy brings the food, there is little chance to give the waiter feedback, or for him to check whether everything is satisfactory.  There is a lot of time between ordering and the drinks and the meal, and there is a definite lack of interaction that is sorely needed at this restaurant. To top it off, the pen left with the check did not work, and again the waitress who took over from the waiter was nowhere to be found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,2.12,2.36,2.448,,2.2640000000000002
0,Loren W.,"San Rafael, CA",0,15,3.0,1.0,2017-12-17,"This is the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a long long time. It started when we were seated the hostess said we don't have any silverware ask your server. Server came 7-8 mins later asked for our drink order and left after the appetizer came ,brought by another guy. I realized no napkins so I ask the hostess that walked by for some she said we don't have any up here it's in the back ask your server. As my hand is now covered in sauce. But wait there's more.  Food comes food is wrong. Call the waiter tell him he runs away then the manager comes over ask  want us to try again YEAH IM starving why did the manager need to ask this .youd think that we would be a priority now well the water glass runs dry Pepsi has no more in it I have to goto the bar and refill my own drinks. So after 15 mins more and not so much as a I'm sorry it's coming out soon from the manager. I tell my girl we our out of here. I do customer service for a living and it's not if you make a mistake that counts it's how you rebound from a mistake that counts and keeps customers. Never will we eat at this place.

27,Lori V.,"Sonoma, CA",0,5,5.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"Awarding one star each for delicious sirracha brussels sprouts and stuffed mushrooms. HOWEVER, bar service was horrendous. Not only impersonal, but slower than hell. Went at 1 pm on a Wed and only 3 people other than myself and my guest at the bar. The bar receipt read ""Paige S"", and while she gave a friendly hello and took our order pretty quickly (as she should with only 3 guests at the bar), she was far more concerned with gossiping with her two friends than serving paying customers. Had to ask someone else for silverware 5 minutes after our apps arrived, never asked how everything was, didn't offer another beverage, and barely even said goodbye! Yelled it from across the bar and said ""thanks"". Won't be returning to this location based on such poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,1.92,2.32,2.448,,2.16

I had to ask if he would also be taking our food order and he said yes. He left and returned 15 mins later to get our food order. Throughout the entire he kept tending to the other tables first, not sure if it was because we were Hispanic and they were White. The waiter kept forgetting to bring us refills on our drinks.

21,Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24.0,1.0,2017-12-28,"Let me be clear: I've been to this location more than a handful of times, and while it's never been stellar, my last experience here was abysmal.  I don't need to go on in detail about it, but there were a lot of problems. We were seated first, but served last. The food was bland and cold. Our food came out before our drinks, and it took at least an hour for our food. They brought us the wrong drinks. We asked for things we never got and got things we didn't ask for, and when they brought us something ""on the house"", we noticed it on the bill. The server seemed so confused by how to use the in-house tech that I was shocked... just -taking- out order took five minutes. Our experience in total was two and a half hours. We didn't order appetizers or a dessert. That's simply unacceptable.  I know I'm going to go back. I like BJ's as a chain and they're convenient to where I live and work, but this kind of service is not going to fly with me again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,1.68,2.31,2.444,,2.0580000000000003
32,Mikayla B.,"Lakewood, WA",159,14,1.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"Only reason I give them one star is because I can't give them 0 stars. As soon as we walked in we were ignored by multiple hostesses that seemed like they literally had no idea how to do their job. We waited 10 minutes before anybody even took our name down. It wasn't until what looked like the manager showed up that we got seated... after he asked multiple hostesses to seat us he finally got one to actually do it. We follow the awkward host to our table where we LITERALLY wait for 30 minutes before a waitress even acknowledges our existence. When we finally flagged down a waitress we found ourselves talking to someone that MUST have been under the influence. She was taking food to the wrong table and when she took our order she asked me multiple times what I wanted to drink as if she never asked me. We ordered our food too because we had so much time to decide, so we order a pizza and she goes ""ooooh... we're out of pizza. We're out of burgers too, a lot of stuff""... I had no idea what else I wanted so I asked for a minute to look at the menu and she just stood there awkwardly like she never heard us.. after she left we literally got up and left so fast.. literally the weirdest experience I've ever had at a restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael,1.68,2.31,2.428,,2.0580000000000003
