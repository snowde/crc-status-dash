119,Jared P.,"Chicago, IL",146,314,23.0,2.0,2012-01-14,"We went to this place because it had a pretty decent review. When we got there, the place was packed and I was thinking ""oh boy, with this many people, it can't be bad!"" Then, they told us we had to wait 20 minutes, which was reasonable for a place this packed. Twenty minutes later, they sat us down and I ordered a beer. They have a bunch of signature beers and I tried an ale. It was good, but I'm not sure if the beer is actually brewed on sight. Many of the brewhouses that I visited back in PA actually have the equipment showing to make it evident that they were brewing on site. If they aren't brewing on site, what makes this beer so special? If they are, let's see the brewing atmosphere! Anyways, all the hype was on this deep dish pizza they serve. I had been craving pizza for weeks and almost resorted to Cici's pizza the weekend before. We got the 5 Meat Large Deep Dish. Now, I'm from the north, so pizza is heavily critiqued, especially in Pittsburgh. First of all, the pizza was kind of cold. No, it wasn't freezing cold, but I expect my pizza to be scald-the-roof-of-your-mouth when it first comes out. This was far from that. Secondly, they used so much oil that it was making my girlfriend sick. She was literally wringing the oil out of the crust after she picked the toppings off. I've eaten pizza with pools of grease on the top, but this was was a little absurd. Was it horrible? Nah. But, it's definitely not worth the price nor the wait when you can get the same thing at the Pizza Hut down the street for a lot cheaper and probably delivered to your door hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=100,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
151,Stan D.,"Arvada, CO",585,283,12.0,5.0,2012-02-16,"We were very pleased when we traveled to Texas, and our friends wanted to meet us here.  We thought this was a Colorado-based restaurant, but we had been there, and knew we liked it.  This Texas version was every bit as good as our favorite in Westminster, CO. I love the beer varieties, and that they happily serve them up in flights.  I prefer the lighter beers, and probably would never try some of the darker varieties if I couldn't get them in the four ounce size.  I discovered I really like the Tatonka stout as a  nice variation of my trusted favorite.    We know we love the pizza here, but this time we tried the pasta.  I had the spaghetti with marinara, and loved it!  Sprinkled with a few red pepper flakes, I found it completely satisfying, especially served with those fine beers, and in that warm, comfortable atmosphere.   BJ's is a winner, and I have never been disappointed with a meal there no matter which state I was in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006

We called ahead for the call ahead seating and still had to wait over 45 min. We said we needed a highchair when we got there, then again when the hostess called us to be seated and then she walked us to our HUGE corner booth table (we had a party of 3 with an infant) I had to remind her for a third time we needed a high chair.  The booth was roomy and comfy but the high chair was so short i could barely see my son over the table, which made it awkward to eat my food and feed him since he was a good 4-6 inches too low to even put his hands on the table.  The place was packed and they had good music playing. Our server was new and I had to ask him twice for A-1 sauce. But overall he provided good service.

163,Ryan H.,"Noblesville, IN",47,117,14.0,3.0,2012-11-07,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has locations in fifteen different states with the majority being in California and Texas, and I visited one in The Woodlands/Shenandoah just north of Houston, Texas.  They have some televisions and a bar but still offer a pretty nice sit-down restaurant atmosphere.  They serve a very large menu that starts out with a good selection of their house beers.  Since I visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse during lunch time, I tried their handcrafted root beer which was good, although I do wish that I sampled one of their alcoholic beers.    BJ's is known for their deep dish pizzas and just recently started serving hand-tossed pizzas. I think my favorite thing about both pizzas is their crust.  The deep dish had a nice soft crust that was similar to a very thick pan pizza's as opposed to traditional deep dish pizzas where the outer edges of the crust are pretty hard.  Additionally, the hand-tossed pizza's crust was thin but still slightly airy making the edges more soft than crispy.  Furthermore, the toppings were pretty good on both pizzas, but I would recommend their deep dish slightly above their hand-tossed pizza.  The nice thing is that they serve their deep dish in many different sizes, and you can go with as small as the mini that I had to ensure you don't get too stuffed.  Even if you aren't looking for pizza, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse's menu likely has something for you, and I would encourage you to visit the Shenandoah location as their staff was very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=160,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9240000000000004,3.0000000000000004

I have tried the restaurant several times, trying to give them an honest chance.  I have never been overly impressed.  This last outing was my last try. When our order came the calzone was cold and not made according to my request.  Our pizza was burnt.  When I asked to have my calzone fixed and reheated they brought it back cold a second time.  To top it off the waitress seemed very apathetic to our concerns.  To me this place is not worth my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=160,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7560000000000002,3.0400000000000005
130,Greg T.,"The Woodlands, TX",16,159,,2.0,2013-01-01,"Sadly the past few visits to BJ's have continued to show a decline in food quality. It's hard enough to find a decent pizza in Houston and BJ's was a restaurant we could count on. That was until they made changes to the way they served the pizzas. Now you get a rather bland and barely warm pizza.  When we complained to our waitress she explained how ""corporate"" has made them change and a lot of customers have been complaining about it.  We then chatted with the manager. He wasn't really concerned about our opinion and stated something similar to what the waitress had said.  Hmm, if they have a lot of complaints and continue down the same path, doesn't that bespeak of just plain stupidity? Or perhaps they are trying to disprove the definition of insanity.  Oh well...the beer is decent and they do have other items.  But we'd still like a HOT PIZZA! Our 2 cents.

They have pizza, pasta, burgers, salads, soups, speciality entrees, great desserts, small bites.  I tried their watermelon salad, (listed under the small plate selection) really delish, it had arugula, greens, chunks of watermelon, pecans, red onions, feta cheese, yum and only $2.95! Perfect starter followed by my veggie/goat cheese flat bread, really delish too.  The portions here are pretty large, you can split a dish or not,. :) They have great beer selection and their special brew of handcrafted beers they make in house.

159,Dan I.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,3.0,2013-05-26,"Decided to try out BJ's as it had been repeatedly recommended by friends as a decent place for late-night dining.  Since our kids were on their ""holiday: sleeping schedule, we were all ready to go and hungry upon arrival @9pm.  The Scene: Carrying a 2 yr-old, asked for child seat.  We have waitstaff already asking for our drink order while we've literally not finished getting seated and I've still got the toddler in my arms. Oh well, maybe I'm overreacting. Nope, the waiter returns in 60 seconds to take our food orders and asks (sarcastically) if we had any questions about their 130+ items on the menu. I asked for 2-3 minutes to look over the menu. Evidently I've now offended them as he doesn't return for more than 10 minutes.  I order chips & salsa (appetizer) as well as our meals.  The chips take around 15 minutes to come out. I'm wondering if they had to gring the corn in back when I see the issue. Their idea of chips & salsa is that is must appear fru-fru.  Three different colors of chips, and beneath the patina of full-size chips on the top are what I'll simply call ""chip crumbles"". As the wife, the kids & I were all starving at this point (I've already downed two excellent root beers), we stuff what we can into our mouths before our meals come out. The salsa is very mild, yet spicy.  While I was shocked at $6 for Chips & Salsa, it was somewhat redeemed by the quality. The meals arrive and wife loves her Jambalaya. I start eating my open-faced chili burger (sans the cheese) and notice the Northern affectation of beans in the chili. The full 8 oz. patty along with the chili is very filling.  The kids enjoy an excellent Grilled Cheese and generic chicken fingers. The fries: They come in two options.  Thin and wedge-cut.  Hoping little fingers would be better off with the thin variety, I got those for the kids and reserver teh wedge-cut for myself. I shold have stuck with the thin, though none were very inspiring. ""Seasoned"" fries?  Not really.  Ore Ida frozen seasoned fries were a step above my wedge-cut ones. The Good: Some of the food was excellent - The Salsa, Wife's Jamabalaya, my chili burger, daughter's Grilled Cheese, the root beer was great. Quick seating, initially attentive waitstaff. Place is beautiful inside. Accessible at times ""normal"" restaurants won't be open.  HUGE menu.  Good-sized portions. Teh dessert we had no room for looked wonderful. The Bad: Fries were worse than Red Robins, and now hold 1st place in my bland hall-of-fame. Aggressive waitstaff combined with ""team delivery"" combined for some crossed messages. Too long to get food, beter bring a snack for very young kids before the food arrives. Bring three plates with fries, but no ketchup? Trying to get said ketchup took 10 minutes with me doing everything but sending up a flare. Got kids?  Hope you don't like the TV, you won't be anywhere near one. You have been segregated to the kid zone at the front. I love having the check early, but mid-meal might be off-putting to some.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8600000000000003,3.4000000000000004

We ordered two appetizers, and they took a very very long time. Once our food started coming out, and it was brought by a different server, we were missing one entree. Given there had been some special requests for the sandwich (no bacon, no cheese.. but is this seriously that confusing?!), but after about 5 mins of waiting, the server finally came by. We asked about the sandwich.. she said she was going to go get it. Well, about 10 mins later, after most of the table had been eating for some time, she comes and says they put cheese on it and had to remake it. About another 10 minutes goes by, and the entire table was done eating minus the one person waiting for the sandwich. When it comes out, its 3 measly pieces of chicken.. not even a single chicken breast. There is NO WAY it took 20 mins to cook 3 small thin pieces of chicken. The server clearly saw how long it took and how bad the timing was. No manager came by, no offer to take it off the bill.  I have been in the service industry for about 10 years now.

185,Ron B.,"Spring, TX",0,38,,4.0,2014-02-14,"We went to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse in Shenandoah tonight to get the free birthday pizookie desert. Had to wait for a table because they are always crowded. Always loved the food here and the service has always been great. Were seated in a timely manner and ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie along with two Irish Cream Coffee's. Irish Coffee's came out pretty quick..but..they did not look right. We previously had Irish Coffee's in a number of restaurants in Galveston where we spent four days enjoying the sites. This did not look anything like what we have been drinking. Tasted it, was okay but no Baily's Irish Cream. Drink looked black like dark coffee, but you could smell the whiskey. Inquired with the waiter about the drinks. He stated that the original Irish Coffee was served with Jameson Whiskey in coffee and no Bailey's. (when we arrived home, I checked on the internet under 'the origin of Irish Coffee' and found at:   that back in 1952 a couple of guys perfected the Irish Coffee that was served in Ireland at the Airport and they nailed it. It does have a Cream poured on top of the coffee that would float.) ...and the majority of the Irish Cream Coffee's served always use Bailey's Irish Cream in the Coffee, and this is what we are used too. They charge $7.75 for their Irish Coffee, which is kind of high for what you get. So, BJ's would be wrong. The employees there are only following the orders passed down from management on what is in their Irish Cream Coffee...which is what we ordered.  The Triple Chocolate Pizookie was EXCELLENT as it always is.

The selection of specialty craft beer on draft was also a pleasant surprise, and I really enjoyed their deep dish pizza . This quickly became one of my favorite places to eat. Lately however service has become inattentive and the quality of the food has changed. The last two times I went there was no sauce on the pizza, even  the second time when I asked for extra sauce. Don't be confused, its not a personal preference of mine for my pizza to be absolutely bathed in sauce, this pizza just simply did not have any sauce either time. I had to ask for extra sauce and dip my pizza like it was a breadstick. Both times the wait staff was inattentive, and the hostesses were not welcoming at all.

Not necessarily negative, but weird start. I think our server was ready to head out the door as we were her last table so not exactly bubbly happy service. Being asked about dessert and having the check dropped when I have more than half of my entree left is not exactly the most ""please stay and enjoy your meal"" notion.  Outside of that, the food was great! I had the Cherry Glazed Salmon (possible correction on exact entree name) and it was perfect. Perfectly flakey salmon, the glaze was sweet but not too much, the couscous had a spice that I loved, the whole thing just worked. My boyfriend enjoyed the Chicken Pita Tacos as well.

They have over 50 handcrafted beers to choose from as well as a full bar.  I'm a vodka kind of gal and they serve up a nice strong Cosmo!  I keep wanting to try new things, but my favorite starter is the fried artichoke hearts with lemon aioli.  So addictive!  This time I added a mozzarella and tomato salad.  It was fresh tasting and beautifully presented, but the cherry tomatoes lacked flavor.  Some nice heirloom tomatoes would have really completed the dish.

The hostess was absolutely miserable, barely even acknowledging us. She then said another girl would seat us, but the second girl was walking away already without knowing she was the one to do the job. Grumpy hostess sat us, not without a huff and puff about it though. Once sat, we met our server; She was so nice! I was thrilled the first impression was off. We ordered almost immediately. After a short time our food came out. My order was wrong; at this point I didn't really mind because I wasn't starving. My boyfriend was pretty upset because he hates eating without me, but I reassured him it was fine and not to worry because I wasn't angry. Then when it came out, boyfriend was finished with his food, and the meal was still wrong (thankfully just in the portioning; I asked for the single portion not double of the pork chops). The waitress blamed it on the kitchen ""hardly being able to understand english"". We then ordered a pizookie (whoever created this dessert is a god), and got the bill. Not only were we not offered the meal on them, or a discounted dessert; but they charged me for the larger sized pork dish!!! Once I brought it up to the waitress her entire attitude changed. She acted like we were an inconvenience to her. And when she finally dropped the corrected check she said in a very irritated tone (as she's walking away, not even looking at us) ""merry christmas"".

First person we saw was our favorite waiter Matt, THE best, he even remembered our favorite drinks after all that time. OK, now to new menu, no they have NOT brought back the Chicken Limone or the Chicken Marsala. What the DO have is lots of Quinoa and couscous! One of the starters is a sautéed Brussel Sprouts with Siracha/honey Crème! Brussels are the new Kale and they were very good, although a bit too sautéed maybe! I like a restaurant that keeps up with trends in food, but I hate that they get rid of winners. It would be good if they gave you a choice with the protein of either pasta, quinoa, rice or couscous, or the cheddar mash even!!  The Happy Hour wine is still only $1 off, the BJ's in Shenandoah is/was a test area for this! Obviously not a lot of people care about paying $10 for a glass of Estancia!!

It is not ""really"" a brewhouse but it sort of looks like one (or a least like a contrived suburban version of one). It does not ""really"" have local craft beers. It is TGI Fridays with a craft brew veneer. In a city with more than a dozen outstanding craft breweries, the local beer selection at BJs is ridiculously weak. Order a Rodeo Clown ""what?"" asks the waiter, ""Anything from Southern Star Brewery?"" (located a few miles north) ""where"" asks the waiter? Bayou City Brewing? ""I do not know."" Do you have any houston beers? ""We have a St. Arnolds."" (one selection). There are many, many places to get great local craft beers in Houston. This is not one of them.  As for the food, it is ordinary fast casual, chain restaurant fare with little thought put into creating unique or interesting flavors.

I had the Lemon thyme chicken and substituted quinoa for the brown rice.  I'm not sure what happened with this dish, because it's what I always order.  For some reason there was a bitter taste and not the usual lemony flavor I love so much.

I am not usually a critical customer, I know being a waiter is not an easy job, but we were completely neglected as if our business was a burden to our waiter.  My mom and I came in for lunch and were seated and given menus. No one came by to get our drink or food order, so we eventually asked a waiter from another table if they could get our waiter for us. The gentleman was nice enough to take our drink and food order and pass that along to our waiter, Robert (although we still had no idea who he was). Later, a female waitress brought out our appetizers without bringing us plates. She walked away so quickly, before we even had a chance to ask for some. Our waiter, Robert, still had not come to our table, so we ended up asking another waiter to bring us plates. After we finished our appetizers, we stacked all of the plates on top of each other, as they usually give you a fresh plate for your entrée. However, when Robert finally came to the table with our pizza, he said, ""Oh did you want a new plate?"". Yes, of course I do, mine is now dirty and stacked between other dirty plates. I also ordered ranch with my pizza, but had to ask for it a second time before they brought it out. That's not a big deal, I was not upset by that. What did upset me is that they did not refill our drinks once during the entire meal. Our glasses were nearly empty before the food came out, and they never once came to check on us unless we called them first. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant, and although we don't believe Robert deserved a tip, we gave him 15% anyway.

Tables, booths etc. they have a huge menu (in my opinion that is too big with to many choices.) BJs menu is priced well and they are between a Red Robin and a TGIF. Not really low end and not high end. My rule of thumb is if you want a steak you go to a steak house, you want fish go to a fish house. BBQ well you get my point. They have everything on their menu, sorta like a jack of all trades but master of none. With that said I was pleasantly surprised that what my wife and I ordered was very good. She ordered the Ahi seared tuna salad and I ordered Jambalaya. She said her salad was very good and the tuna was also very good. I was not expecting anything but mediocre but my Jambalaya was as good as any New Orleans type restaurant I've been to. Others at the table ordered Fish and chips, Fried chicken and a steak.

When my son invited me there I agreed only because the previous experience was good. I ordered the same entree but they decided to leave out a few things - like the seasoning, the onions and the olives. So what they gave me was a piece of overcooked, dried out salmon with some boiled shrimp with some canned tomatoes. I sent it back and a few minutes later the manager came over and offered to make it over. Why did they serve me the returned entree to begin with? He didn't know. What will be different this time-if you can't make it right t second time, why not the first time? Asked if I wanted something else - I declined. He said he was sorry and to let him know if I wanted to order something else  and left. Not the first time they just decide to send whatever out of the kitchen and hope you just accept it.

So you can bring the whole family out and not break the bank.  To start off we had the calamari appetizer which came with two sauces. We all (5) thought it was pretty good.  I had the pepperoni flatbread. It was good ... But ... You better seriously  love pepperoni because it comes loaded with it. $11 My wife had a salad. It looked ok, but I can't comment because real men don't order salad as a main course. It should only come as a side dish in my opinion.  My son had a sandwich with large cut fries (see pic) he thought it was great.  My daughter in law had the chicken Parmesan.  She loved it, but, looking at it I would have given it a just ok.  Lastly, my daughter had a burger with fries. It was quite large and she loved it. This is a burger place so if your a burger person your in luck here.

Appetizer - sampler of mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, garlic parmesan boneless chicken wings, and spinach artichoke dip with chips.  Cheese sticks and marinara met expectations.  Nothing bad to say.  Avocado rolls had too much avocado and not much else.  The tamarind sauce on the side is what made it worthwhile.  Very great flavor that I used to dip the garlic parmesan bites into.  The chicken was tender and lightly breaded, but could have used more sauce drizzle.  Some what dry but rectified with the tamarind sauce intended for the avocado rolls.  And the dip would have been okay had it not been dried out.  I prefer creamy and less clump so I can actually get it on the chip without breakage.  $17.95 for the platter was a bit pricy. Side salad - romaine, iceberg, and spinach.  Strawberry vinaigrette was light enough.  Normal enough salad. Main entrée - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos.  Decent size and good amount of protein.  Just seemed like something was missing and it was very dry.  I asked for cucumbers and red onions to be removed....but think they also left out the cilantro.  Reasonably priced at $9.95 since I substituted the side grains for the side salad. The desserts were limited.  I didn't bother to try the pizookie they seem to be known for.  They had options but it just didn't seem like what I wanted to complement the meal.  Overall, I enjoyed that our server knew the menu well.  She never hesitated in answering our questions.  She was however not very attentive and we could have used refills on waters.  At the end of the meal, we waited too long for her to return and take payment that we decided to pay at the take out register.

57,Willie And Melissa E.,"Conroe, TX",160,26,5.0,3.0,2017-01-28,"Our family visited this restaurant for my son's birthday recently. We had a party of 10. We attempted to call ahead and get on the list just in case, but they wouldn't take call aheads over 6 people. When we arrived, we were greeted by the same hostess that took my call earlier. She was welcoming and friendly. We arrived quite early in the evening, so fortunately there wasn't a wait. We only had to wait about 5-7 minutes for them to get our table set up. Once seated, our waiter was very attentive while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We ordered the fried cheese and calamari to start. Both dishes were delivered lukewarm. We've visited this restaurant many times before and had much better. They tasted as though they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a little too long. I ordered the American bacon cheeseburger and it was good. My wife had the chicken tortilla soup with a salad. The kids had chicken and burgers. The rest of our family got various dishes from fish and chips to the steak. I didn't hear any complaints from anyone. The thin cut fries are yummy and crispy and they always offer a heaping portion with the meal. The only negative seemed to be the temperature of the food. We like food brought hot and very fresh, but all the dishes seamed to have been sitting under a heat lamp a little too long waiting for someone to run it to our table. Another negative was that our dishes were brought out maybe two at a time. Some of us had our food in front of us but had to wait for the other dishes to be delivered before we could start eating. Throughout the meal, they began seating more large parties around us in our same waiter's section, slowing down our service immensely. For some odd reason they sit all large parties in the same area in this restaurant with the same server. Because of this, we were done with our meals and waiting for what seemed like forever just to order our desserts. Being that it was my son's birthday, we couldn't leave without a pazookie. It is a must if you visit this place. The cookies are baked fresh and served with a generous scoop of ice cream. Delicious! Get the mini for yourself. The regular size is more than enough to share with one or two more people. Once we finally ordered our desserts, we waited for probably 10-15 minutes (to be expected for this dessert) but when they brought them out, somehow everyone but my son got their dishes. His came out about 5 minutes later. The server was in the weeds with no backup, so we sat without drink refills for way too long. In conclusion, the food is mediocre, the desserts are amazing, the service is okay (but they need to spread out the big parties to other servers) and the restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will be back with my family for dinner in the future, but I doubt I will return with a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=40,3.24,3.15,3.15,2.508,3.186

When we moved to Conroe, we adopted the Shenandoah location. For a while, everything was great. The past couple visits have been atrocious. We visited this Saturday at about 3:00pm. There were empty seats everywhere but we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. When you see this at a restaurant, you know its in trouble and you probably are if you chose to eat there. We did anyway.... First, when we were finally sat, no one greeted us forever. It took staring down the manager across the room to get her to come an get our drink order while our server hurried over to not get in trouble. When our drinks arrived, there was dried food caked to the bottom of the glass and food caked to our silverware as well. Disgusting. There was also food all over the floor and paper napkins still stuck in the booth.  When my salad arrived, there were all sorts of little pieces of food in it that were clearly from another dish. There was a green gookie substance and several noodles that did not belong.  Against my better judgment, we ordered a Pizookie because I had promised my son and is too young to understand if I didn't order it. We ordered when they brought our entree out and ended up still sitting there forever waiting. Once we were finished, we still waited forever to get out check.  This restaurant has gone down hill. We really love the concept and other restaurants in the chain so we keep giving it another chance, only to be disappointed every time.

89,Julia K G.,"Montgomery, TX",1,18,9.0,1.0,2017-05-25,"The following is a copy of a letter that I composed and sent to corporate offices that I never received the consideration in a response in ---------- Forwarded message --------- Date: Tue, Feb 3, 2015 at 11:38 PM Subject: Inappropriate attention to detail To:  02-03-2015 Location of complaint: The Woodlands TX, 19075 I-45 South, 600, Shenandoah, TX 77385 I am stating a formal complaint regarding the disregard in professional accommodation to a client's needs in diplomacy to mutually resolve unsatisfactory food and beverage requests. My grievances include several circumstances that occurred the evening of 02-03-2015, and are described as follows: All soda beverages were not carbonated and service was unacceptable in having the drinks replaced. My son and I were never able to have this issue resolved and much to my dismay I was furthered charged per drink, so I was inconvenienced into dispute resolution with a manager to elevate the problem. My primary complaint and concerns are the result of an order of ""Garlic Chicken Wings"" and when we realized that the inside meat was frozen and there was visual evidence of blood. I brought this to the waiter's attention and he offered to have them ""cooked up more"". I declined his offer and advised him to remove the order from my bill. Unwilling to do so, It was necessary to request a manager. Unfortunately our waiter was not attentive in compelling this particular individual to join us at our table or the manager refused to do so. The disconcerting  attention of the manager proved to be apathetic and noncompliant in professionally offering concessions for the unacceptable circumstances in a regrettably disrespectful and argumentative approach. The manager denied the problem and informed me that he would agree to recook the item or replace it with the same item, but refused to replace the order with another selection associated with the uncooked meat. I declined this offer and proceeded to inform him that I would insure that my credit card company decline the charge to BJ's if the fountain drinks and raw meat appetizer wasn't removed from my charges. The manager begrudgingly then removed the charges from my bill. I was not offered qualifying options to rectify or compensate me for the problem. This circumstance was my first and last encounter with the ""BJ's"" brand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=60,2.84,2.94,2.94,2.6920000000000006,2.9

However, every time I have been, the service has been atrocious! We barley ever see our servers and everything takes so long to get delivered to our table. The soft drinks are never carbonated and are always flat and sweaty. On several occasions, the food has taken an hour plus to make. Managers all always at people's tables cleaning up employees mistakes and apologizing. It takes about 20-30 minutes for appetizers to come out, followed shortly with the main course. I will say the pizookie is the reason I keep coming back, it is wonderful. But it takes about half an hour to get to our table too. It is really sad because I love the food, but the service is always awful. It doesn't matter if it's a week night or weekend, busy or not, it is awful every time.

She went ahead and took our drink and food orders which was very considerate of her. We had seen the girl working in the section we were sitting in pass us by many times helping out the table right next to ours. Not sure if there was a shift or section change and our server was not informed that we were hers to take care of but we were clearly next to the table she was helping out for quite some time. There was no apology from her.  When the food came to the table, we weren't asked how our food was until we were almost done and asked for the check. She finally apologized and said the server that had our table prior to her was cut and she wasn't informed. If we had been told ahead of time, this review wouldn't have been put on the yelp page. She avoided us the majority of the time as if we weren't there. Food is usually pretty consistent so I never have any complaints on their food. Service, on the other hand, wasn't the best.

First, as we drove up, it was slightly raining and there was a young man walking a lady to her car with an umbrella. I figured since he saw us pull up, he would offer to allow us to use the umbrella but not. That was ok because we had two in the car. Once we got in, we were seated and I purposely looked at my phone to check the time to see how long it was going to take them to help us. After sitting there for a minute or two watching all these servers walking back and forth and another lady setting up a table, as she walked by I asked if someone could help us. She said let me get your server. She walked off and went and got someone but instead of helping us she helped her put more forks on the table. I didn't say anything. I just continued to watch. She then went back to the front and stood there, looked around and stood there. We waited and no one ever came so we got up to leave. Oh yea, another couple came in after us and were helped before us! As we got up, another lady said she was right behind us because they brought her food and didn't bring her drinks. As we were walking out, the hostess said have a good night. I told her I would with no thanks to them and told her what happened.

We arrived at the restaurant and still had to wait 15-20 min to be seated. When we reached our seats we waited another 15-20 minutes before we were informed that they were backed up and our waitress would be with us.

After approaching the hostess stand to ask who our waiter/waitress was I was told she was wrapping up with another large party and would be with ya shortly. After about 5-10 min the HOSTESS comes over and says she will have to take our drink order. We requested to put in orders for appetizers and were told that she couldn't take appetizer order, I understand you are a hostess. We are 45 min in and  still no visit from Kierra. I only know her name because we were told that's who our waitress was when we requested to speak with a manager.  We are now an hour in and the hostess brings waters to the table behind us but don't serve us. She just sits them on the table behind us. 1:10 we decide to flag down Alexis who has been diligently waiting on her tables and ask for a manager and explained we still have not received drinks and were told we could not order appetizers.

The staff is really nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.4,3.02,3.02,,3.1720000000000006

There are flat screens in every corner. Great spot to watch the games.  We had such a great time and no one rushed us out, even though there were people waiting to be seated. A whooping 5 hours at BJ Brew. We spent so long here, we had 2 waiters and more drinks and food! Great night! Thanks for showing excellent customer service and welcomed large parties!! Go Astros!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.4,3.05,3.05,,3.19

4,Indira M.,"Kingwood, TX",18,45,31.0,3.0,2017-12-14,I had the broccoli cheese soup and I have to say it was way over salted. I added the beet and goat cheese salad from the appitizer menu and that was lovely.  My friend had the chicken lettuce wrap and the nibble I tasted was really good.  I also thought that the wine was overpriced and thus the OK rating.  Our server was good but a bit slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.28,3.05,3.05,,3.142

3,Penny W.,"Spring, TX",50,13,2.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"Bad Food Experience at BJs last night.  We wanted deep dish pizza and were at Porto Fino so we went there. It was the worst food I've had in  a long time.  Avacado Rolls: mushy outer roll, avocado mushy and brown, no flavor. Didn't eat it.  Wedge Salad (didn't think you could make a bad one but they succeeded): hunk of iceberg  -not even sliced into a wedge - with outer layers wilted - not crispy with a few TBSP. of toppings.  Pizza: ordered a Deep dish Veg pizza w half chicken. It arrived with full chicken. Sent it back. Next one came as ordered. One bite and I was done. Yuck. Mushy crust. I suspected there was no sauce so I scraped the the toppings off my piece. No sauce AND No cheese. I scraped the toppings off the whole pizza - same thing!  We called the server over (who was very good) and showed the Pizza to her and she was embarrassed. She said there was a new Pizza chef who thinks he makes the best ever. I requested she take the pizza and show it to him and suggested he re-think his idea of ""best Pizza ever."" The Mgr. came, I explained our whole food experience and told him we were long time customers but will not be returning. He offered weak apology and walked away. No effort to rectify things whatsoever.! We had to ask the server to take the pizza off the bill. No other comps. Unbelievable. So sad. We went to Russos as we were still hungry and to satisfy our Pizza craving .  This BJs location lost 10+ year customers.. Russo's and  Crust  will keep us returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.4,3.06,3.06,,3.1960000000000006

9,R X.,"Conroe, TX",0,14,,2.0,2017-12-22,"We went on a Friday night and were seated pretty quickly.  The menu I got was sticking together as if the plastic had recently been wiped down but not allowed to dry.  The salt shaker was greasy.   The avacado egg rolls were rather flavorless and I didn't care for the sauce that came with it.  We weren't given plates for the appetizer and asked our rather scatterbrained waitress for some.  When they arrived, one of the plates was wet and another one had stuck on dried food. I got the baked ziti which was pretty good.  One person in our group got a chicken dish which she said was room temperature and not hot.  Overall, average food with horrible service that's twice what I would expect to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.28,3.1,3.1,,3.1720000000000006
8,Suzanne M.,"Conroe, TX",0,17,,1.0,2017-12-26,"My family eats at this restaurant a lot. However, the last 4 times to be exact have been bad. I order potato skins and their tortilla soup. Tonight they brought the potato skins out burnt they had little to no cheese they forgot to add bacon and no chives, so disappointing. My soup was luke warm. My husbands chicken wings did nothing for him. Needless to say we won't be back again. I can check another restaurant off my list. They have consistently gone down hill and tonight the potato skins were the deal breaker.

5,Jen D.,"Houston, TX",231,9,1.0,1.0,2018-01-09,"I do a lot of catering for my job and I used this restaurants online website to place a catering order for pickup 24+ hours in advance. I received a confirmation email saying my order was placed. When I arrived at 11am the next day (when my order was supposed to be ready) they didn't even have the order and gave some excuse that the 11am pick up time is the reason it wasn't received? Ok so why would the system even allow 11am as an option? I spoke to the manager and he never apologized or even offered to comp. anything from my order. Needless to say, I was 30 minutes late to bring my customers lunch. I spend at least $200/day on catering and my money will definitely be spent somewhere more reliable with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah,3.04,3.08,3.08,,3.0640000000000005
