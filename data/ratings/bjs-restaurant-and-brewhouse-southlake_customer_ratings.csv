78,Elizabeth N.,"Grapevine, TX",0,2,,1.0,2015-06-15,It's a Monday night and it took FOREVER to get our food. Wedge salads were not the same size (one was much smaller than the other) and there were BUGS on the table. The manager did NOTHING. She didn't comp the salad or anything else.

95,Elke E.,"Keller, TX",0,3,,2.0,2015-06-17,"I've tried this place twice since it opened. We were so excited, we've been so happy with every other location we've tried. First visit: kids pizza undercooked, they ran out of my pizookie flavor (salted caramel) do they brought peanut butter instead - yuck! Then the waiter decided I needed to know what he does in real life, since he's not really a waiter, he's an ultimate fighting championship enthusiast - ok wow, who cares. Second visit tonight - waiter worse than first one, left empty drinks tray on our table for 15 minutes until we asked him to remove it. The Ahi tuna salad tasted dirty and the avocado was brown and mushy. Otherwise food was ok, but once again I got waiters life story without prompting, this one owns his own landscaping business and lives in a huge fancy house his father in law bought him and his girlfriend when he was 18. He only waits tables for beer money apparently, again who cares? If you don't want to do this job than leave it to people who need / want to work there! Was the hiring manager so bad this is the caliber of people they were able to get? I don't know if we will return, I don't want to hear about how my server is too good to be doing his job. I would recommend corporate send in managers quickly to salvage.

I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, and wow!  Ok, I love sushi anyway, but that being said I am very picky about my fish.  The Ahi has a fantastic flavor and is very simple.  Honestly, next time I will probably just order 2 of those and make it a meal.  The only complaint I would have, is that it would be easier to work with if I had been given chopsticks.  Trying to put the tuna on a wonton cracker is difficult with a fork...  Just saying.

The food came in about 45 minutes later, but it was rush hour and my mom and I had ordered pizza while my father ordered a huge plate.

The service was great from our waiter although it was a little slow for the kitchen but it was pretty busy and it's a new restaurant. Been there twice now. I loved the healthy menu options - the Barbacoa chicken was amazing! Also the Santa Fe salad was really yummy. Potato skins were delish and sooo much beer to try!

The wait staff decided to break the tables up and give them to smaller parties that came in after we had arrived. 7 different groups walked up after us that were seated in tables that could have fit our group. The women at the front told us our table was being cleaned off but 20 minutes later it was still not ready. She then said she could split us up but the tables were across the restaurant from each other. We decided to split up so we could finally grab food. The waitress took about 15 minutes to just grab waters. It wasn't completely packed this evening either. There were open tables and the wait staff did not look overly concerned with moving quickly.

55,pete s.,"Colleyville, TX",19,21,,2.0,2015-07-18,"I visited this locale on Saturday circa 615pm.  No wait which is nice. However, the service was horrible. Our waiter was not very attentive so we have to ask several times for items. The food came AFTER the manager delivered it to us and apologized for the 29 minute wait. My wife and I both ordered fish which was cold and overcooked.  When it came to the bill. Our waiter stopped by our table with another table's dirty dish on his hands.  When we rejected the desert idea - he began to search his pockets for our bill AND PLACED ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S DIRTY DISH on our table in order to free his hands.  The waiter (Herbert) NEVER apologized for the lengthy wait time for food.  I know new locales have to workout their service kinks but this restaurant does not meet baseline expectations - tasteful food, lack of timely food delivery, and ownership for bad service.

All appetizers were super delicious! The tables favorite was the potato skins.  Entrees included ribs, sirloin steak, roast beef dip, tomato basil soup, clam chowder soup, and a loaded burger. All were pretty decent tasting entrees. There's no way to end the night without having a pizookie and our table ordered a trio containing salted caramel, chocolate chunk, and triple chocolate.

Lori our server was extremely attentive and got us drinks right away even though our entire party wasn't there yet. She also made sure menus, appetizers were all added as the rest of our party joined us. Our drink glasses were never empty. The appetizers were delicious potato skins by far the best. Brussels sprouts, which we all normally love were sadly over cooked and left a pretty strong burnt taste in our mouths. Poke tuna also delicious. Clam chowder bowl rivaled that of our favorite place in Monterey,California-needless to say, delicious! Ribs were fall off the bone tender. The double bacon cheeseburger was the envy of the table topped only by the pizookie  cookie sundaes. Chocolate chunk and salted caramel won out of all three ordered. Terrific experience. Wait staff cleared dishes so promptly we never had to ask. The food was timed perfectly. All in all...a new favorite destination for a quick lunch or casual evening out.

After it was so late that we needed to leave, I asked to cancel our order, after hunting down our waiter who was ignoring us. He said no and promised our food was on its way, and a few minutes later, SOME of it was. No apologies, no discounts, no rush to get us the check, no attempt to pick it back up!

22,Michael B.,"Lexington, MA",2,131,3.0,2.0,2016-06-03,"Tried BJ's Brewhouse after a day of business meetings on a recent trip to Dallas/Westlake. Mixed reviews resulted in the 2 star rating.  First the beers; while a Brewhouse with a laundry list to sample, it seemed we picked all the wrong ones. Each tap seemed to lack the right level of carbonation. It's my opinion that you need to trim down the beer list so that you can serve the freshest product to your customers.  Second the food menu: it was similarly huge and almost overwhelming. The avocado appetizer was crunchy and full of flavor. The Sriracha Queso Dip with warm, salty chips were another hit. The burgers were big, juicy, and came with A plentiful portion of shoestring fries equally crispy and salty.  The New Orleans jambalaya was less than stellar lacking much flavor or uniqueness.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was plentiful, but just too much sauce for my liking. The shoestring fries were the hit of the plate and maybe the best item on the entire menu that we ordered.  Lastly, the Pizookie dessert (cookie with ice cream) was good, but not much room left after sizable meals.  My suggestion is to keep it simple and order a burger with fries and wash it down with a popular beer which should be from a fresher keg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-southlake?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.8560000000000003,2.6

We came with a group of about 10 people and our waitress was awesome! I don't remember her name..she had dreads I think but she was attentive, fast and witty!  Came here a couple of weeks ago and we mustve gotten stuck with the worst waitress there. I'm not going to be mean and put her name on my review (even though I took a photo of her name on my receipt). Husband and I had a double date with another couple. There wasn't a line to wait for a seat and the place wasn't super busy. Our waitress was working a couple of other tables and a party table of about 15 people that were finishing up their meals. It took her about 15 minutes to even get our WATER orders..I understand she had a larger party to attend to but I was observant and 95% of the time she was no where to be found. She wasn't even giving the proper amount of attention to the group of 15 people! After another 20 minutes of waiting around for her, she finally came back to take our food orders. She disappeared again and other staff members brought us out our food, however my friend didn't get her food yet. 10 minutes later...she still doesn't have her food. We see our waitress walk by TWICE (even looking at our table) without saying a word. Finally she came back with my friends food. Dropped the plate off without a word. No apology. No asking how our food came out. No refills on our waters. nothing... At this point we are all pretty annoyed. I couldn't help but notice that during the time where she was MIA her hairstyle magically changed. She had enough time to take out her long braid and pull her hair up in to some fancy ponytail...but no time to check on us. Less than 5 minutes into my friend finally getting her food she then asks if we want dessert...we say no..then 2 minutes later brings us the checks.. Keep in mind..my friend isn't even half done with her food. After bringing our check she finally refills our waters. Still no questions about how our food was etc etc. We requested to speak with the manager and my friend gave him an earfull on the waitresses lack of service. He was kind enough to take care of her meal.  Food is good, but I will make sure if I do come back to this location and I see this girl working I will request to not be seated in her zone.

Excellent, large selection of both healthy and less healthy options, with plenty of choices for kids too. I had the half California club flatbread with an upgrade to the watermelon salad to accompany it.  Salad was excellent while the flatbread, while good, didn't have enough toppings and left a little to be desired.

73,Morgan W.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-08-27,"BJ's has awesome food but the service was absolutely awful (the hostess who greeted us was wonderful and very nice). We went at 2:00 pm and the restaurant was maybe half full at most. We sat down and were passed by 4+ servers who just looked at us and continued walking. 15 minutes later our server came by and asked us for our order. Since we had quite some time to look at the menu, we wanted to go ahead and order our food too so we could minimize our wait time. When we told our waitress, she wouldn't let us and said she was going to get our drinks first. After taking our drink order, she proceeded to greet and take orders for a table of 4 that had JUST sat down mere seconds ago (keep in mind that this was 15 minutes after we had been seated).  After taking their order, she disappeared for another 10 minutes and she served the other table before us even though we had waited much longer. She placed our drinks on the table and once again, didn't take our food order. She left again making us wait even longer.  She then went to another table and took their drink orders! She couldn't take our food order but went directly to another table to take their drink order. They also got to order their appetizer with their drinks unlike when she told us we couldn't. We then watched the table of 4 receive their food before us even though we were a party of 2 that ordered before them. When we got our food, one of the orders was incorrect. We had ordered a burger without tomatoes and mayo. When we got the burger it only had meat and the bun. It was completely bare. The kitchen hadn't put anything on it. The waitress had to go to the back and get the missing lettuce and onion to bring to our table. Once we were done, we got our pizookie (the manager had told us if we download the BJs app, we would get it for free. And if we had problems downloading it, just let our server know and they would take care of it).  When trying to download the app, we had issues because the service was very weak inside the building. We told the server this and she said okay no problem. She then comes back to the table and tells us that the manager needs us to download the app so she can see it when she had told us otherwise on our initial entrance (the app was taking so long to download due to the service). This was so frustrating as the manager was contradicting her initial statement. We then tried downloading it again and spent 15 minutes waiting for it to download just to have the server come by and tell us the manager took care of it. It was yet another wasted 15 minutes. This was unbelievable customer service and just downright bad. I will not be returning to this location as it's clear that their focus isn't on customer service.  Completely turned off by this and that we were shoved in a back corner and ignored for 20+ minutes.  Our servers name was Sophia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-southlake?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.9800000000000004,2.76

It's dark in the bar area so it was hard to see. Neither my friend nor I come here often so we needed more time to peruse the menu. The server seemed annoyed by this. He was also not knowledgeable of the menu when I asked of the clam chowder was New England or Manhattan style. I settled for the unlimited soup and salad and started off with the Ahi Poke shareable which I had no intention of sharing since my companion didn't like seafood.

The restaurant is open, with high ceilings and the bar has many tv screens. We have dined only in the bar area, which is open seating. Both times, our waitresses have been patient and attentive. They know the menu well and helped us pick out a variety of their own beers that they make. Our friends have opted for the beer flights, to help them decide which kind of brewsky they would want to order for dinner. I also saw on the wall that they have flights for bourbon (can you say dangerous?!) We always start with the Ahi Poke- so delicious and healthy, with raw tuna, cabbage, onions and herbs. During our first visit, I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa bowl with salmon. If you are a quinoa lover, this dish will be right up your alley. It includes spinach, mushrooms, garlic and then the salmon was cooked perfectly. My husband always gets the same thing- the ahi salad. Huge portion with tasty toppings. During our last visit, I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp-just as good. Our friend ordered the xxx hot spicy wings. Now, this man is used to eating super spicy foods, so the spice wasn't much for him-the waitress brought out some sriracha sauce for him to use as a dipper!
