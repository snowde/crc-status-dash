350,Moua L.,"Concord, CA",179,356,434.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"So glad I decided to come here instead of a Pho house.  The recommendations from the waiter was outstanding. He was so truthful and I love that. It's all about the Seared Ahi Tuna salad. This plate was enough to feed 3 of us. The salad dressing was one of the best dressings I've had in a long time as well. Hope it's not filled with high fructose corn syrup. That would be just wrong.  In addition to getting the salad, we had ourselves each a cocktail (which were on the sweeter side) and calamari appetizers. We asked the waiter if they were fresh and we got ""fresh"" calamari.    This place is now on the top of my list of places to go to when visiting Stockton.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=240,3.44,3.3,3.3,2.8960000000000004,3.3560000000000003

I ordered the Mediterranean Deep Dish Mini Pizza and with the happy hour special it was only $5!  It comes with 4 slices and it's pretty filling.  I loved the sliced peperoncinis - spicy and sour!  The crust is just amaaaaazing and a must order for happy hour.

302,A C.,"Lodi, CA",0,24,,2.0,2012-03-17,"Great decor. I love the dark motif. Definitely an improvement over other chain restaurants which sometimes seem deliberatly loud (design as such). Thats all good I can say.  The food was atrocious. I had chicken wings which were certainly frozen and fried, not fresh. and they were cold in the middle. Sent them back. Had a salad that was drenched in dressing. very heavy handed.  lastly, had tortilla soup and tomato bisque. They were of a quality on a par with the soups you get from Safeway (Signature soups). Sure those are alright from the grocery store, full of salt, but still....they aren't bad at all. But at a restaraunt ?  I felt that they literally just opened up one of those, poured it in a bowl and served it up for a price. The soup was not fresh, thick and disgusting.  Service, atmosphere, timing of service, dealing with sent back food was all good. I will not be going back because I can get better food at the grocery store.  Also, had 2 of their beers (red, pale ale). Not exceptional, nothing to write home about and they had ample selections from the tap. kudos for that. if I wanted to go somewhere to have a drink and an appetizer, I would go back.

We were seated nearly right away, pausing only so they could clean and set up a table for us. Our waiter was attentive, charismatic, knowledgeable, and prompt! He kept our waters filled, switched out empty Coke glasses for full ones, gave us a run down of all their drink specials and seasonal dishes. He encouraged dessert, but in a non-pressuring sort of way. The food was also pretty good. I had the enLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango salad (dressing on the side). It was tasty with a good ratio of chicken to salad, which is often something lacking in low-calorie dishes. The dressing was also quite tasty. It seemed that everyone else loved their dishes also. My mom ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, my sister ordered the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo, my dad ordered the Turkey Club, and my uncle ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza deep dish.  When my sister inquired about the garlic bread that was supposed to come with her dish according to the picture on the menu, the waitress who delivered it said it didn't come with it. However, moments later, our main waiter came by and delivered a couple slices of garlic bread saying, ""I always think the dish should look like the picture"". So nice! We were in a bit of a rush to head out towards the end of our meal, so we asked for the check and our waiter was quick to hand it over and also got a box for the other half of my uncle's pizza.

463,Miguel A.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,3.0,2012-11-10,"""BJ's Restaurant and Brew house"" I really love the pizza from BJ's, but my only complaint is that the waiters sometimes are really slow. For example, they come to get you started with drinks but they do not usually bring them until the food arrives which is ridiculous because the drinks are ready. Let me tell you about the pizza, their menu includes a different variety of pizzas. You can choose between meat and vegetables and you can put as many ingredients as you want. One of my favorites is the BJ's Favorite, but I hate olives so I always replace them with jalapenos because I love spicy food. Another one of my favorites is the chicken BBQ pizza, so delicious which I also add jalapenos. If you love them both, you can also get two of your favorite pizzas in one, awesome right? When I cannot decide which one I want the most, I just get half of the BJ's favorite & half of the chicken BBQ. They also have a different variety of beers, which include their own beers and international beers, so you have plenty of options. I love dark beer, one of my favorites is the nutty brunette; and if you want to explore their beers you can ask to try it. Which is awesome because you try different beers and based on that you can choose which one is the best choice for you. I can say I have had good service at times but it is not consistent. Depending on the waiter that is how your experience is going to go. On my last visit I had such a great waiter, she was checking on us often which I appreciate.

I've been faithful to this place since it opened and continue to take people there and frequent the place despite hit and miss food and service that ranges from being rushed, being ignored and having a great time.  Tonight, my food was not good. The server who I really like, up sold my boyfriend on the pizza, salads and pizookie deal, although it wasn't that great of a deal for us and I had already ordered my own food. Our drinks took forever, salad came about 5 minutes before the food did. Salad contained brown pieces of lettuce but was good otherwise, pizza and pasta were skimpy on sauces and toppings and about 30% of my pasta had no sauce, with large, still uncooked broccoli mixed in.  Bad food nights happen, I understand.. however when we were done eating, it was another 40 minutes before our pizookie arrived. A male manager showed up with it and said ""here it is, sorry."" and left. Our server indicated that the pizookie was supposed to be comp'd due to the awful wait times, but then didn't do anything to have the price of the meal adjusted. We had to ask for our check three times, it took another 20 minutes for the check to arrive, and another 15 or so for someone else to take my money.  In this time, I asked the hostess to speak with a manager. I kindly explained how we had been there for nearly 2 hours and how bad our experience was, and all she did was stare at me blankly, ask where we were seated, and brought me free pizookie coupons. You know, for the amount of money I spend here, and the nearly 2 hour time we'd been there that should've only been 40-45mins, I would've liked to have been offered a reduction in my bill (no alcohol) if not even a free meal.  I couldn't take my leftovers home, as they'd been sitting on the table for over an hour and I didn't want to chance getting sick from food being out too long at the wrong temperature. Again, no offer from BJs staff to fix the situation. Thanks for the pizookie coupons.. I'm sure someone at work will love them. I won't be back to this location again as this is my last straw with this place. Too many times has my service been bad, my food cold or undercooked, or my $8 cocktails taste like they forgot the alcohol. I'm tired of paying $45 to have my time wasted and being disappointed when I was expecting a decent meal out.  It's a shame.. I used to love this place.

I've gotten a pizookie platter before when I've dined in and for some reason, this one looked A LOT smaller than I remember. I should've just made my own. I get to the To-go counter, and there was  2 employees just standing behind the counter with their arms crossed. NOT ONE of them asked me if I had been helped already. maybe the to-go area isn't where they're supposed to be working, but seriously, they could've at least asked if i had been helped, and grabbed someone who could actually help me. FINALLY someone helped me, and I had to wait about 10 min. they said because the pizookie was still baking, although I had called in 4 hrs prior and told them I would be there at a specified time to pick it up. When it came time to eat the pizookie, the top was cooked, but when we bit into it, it was still doughy. I felt so embarrassed that my guests got pieces of a raw cookie. There was some leftover pizookie, and when I went to look under the pizookie...it was all raw. next time I'm just going to make my own pizookie and purchase my own tub of vanilla ice cream. i'm sure all that would be cheaper than $22.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=340,1.84,2.85,2.85,2.3440000000000003,2.4460000000000006

197,Marlene T.,"Florence, KY",213,227,2241.0,2.0,2014-02-06,"Ehem, let me state first I am not usually a purveyor of chain restaurants. My friends decided to pick me up so we could all get to the restaurant together and I was staying nearby visiting and the closest. Bad mistake. I should have got there first (1) because the wait for tables is often long (as I observed through our whole visit). And (2) you can't get the happy hour prices unless you sit at the bar area. Which is apparently, always full. When we showed up we were actually seated fairly quickly, which appeared to be a fluke from when we showed up. There were waves of people I saw going in before us, and waves after us. Regardless, I was happy at least about that. We each ordered a beer and decided on a few appetizers as we all just wanted some munchies to share while we chatted. They did bring me a happy hour menu at my request and I could see that we were literally paying double for everything we ordered since we were not in the bar area. I inquired if it was possible to get happy hour prices and was politely informed ""We use different registers on the floor. They aren't programmed to allow us to change the prices even if we wanted to"". I somehow have a hard time believing that they were inept at asking management to comp meals or give discounts. They just weren't probably allowed with this case. Hmm, so this translates to a larger tip for the server and more money for the restaurant and more out of our pockets. Had I not been visiting with friends I would have walked out across the parking lot and headed to Boudin's. The beer was pretty standard issue. The food was decent pub like food. We ordered the margarita flat bread pizza, the boneless wings in spicy sauce, and the calamari. This was enough to feed three people adequately. I read on the menu that the flat bread pizza was 90 calories for each slice and came with 8 slices. Had I been by myself and only ordered that I could have eaten the whole thing. It wasn't filling, the toppings were slopped on without care (the end pieces had no toppings - we used the sauce from the calamari), and it was more like a cracker than a flat bread. I still like crackers so it worked but I was worried I was shoveling calories down my throat and wondered what the heck I was getting out of it. Still, I'll be the first to admit - if you go out to eat, you generally toss the calorie concern out the window. The boneless wings, or glorified chicken chunks were good. The buffalo style sauce was really, really, really salty. I think I would ask for that sauce on the side if we order it again. The blue cheese sauce had a mild hint of blue cheese but as one in my party said ""It might as well be ranch"". The chicken was juicy and well, was chicken. The calamari we ordered with tomato marinara as one in our party we consider allergic to garlic since he is so hypersensitive to it. They were fine with subbing sauce, though he said it wouldn't bother him if we wanted the garlic aioli. I'm not much into mayo so we were all happy to get marinara.  I found a piece of carrot in the boneless wings, which was nummy. And another in our party found a french fry in the calamari. He liked it, but neither was supposed to be in each of those dishes. All in all the food was just so-so, the average for chain restaurants. The beer okay, nothing special. The service was good and prompt and polite. I'm just still horribly offended about the happy hour policy since I've never run into this anywhere else I've eaten. I'm sure it exists at other places, and apologies to be harsh as this is the first place to pop my happy hour expecting bubble. I can't say I'd go out of my way to eat here. I'd probably head over to Applebee's in all honesty for the same quality food, brand name beer I love, and cheaper prices. Oh and the reason it gets knocked down to two stars from an average meh three ... no wifi! Everyone has guest or at the least hot spot wifi in highly commercial restaurant areas. Get with the program! How are we supposed to check into Yelp? Oh right, they're so cheap they want us to use our own bandwidth.

Mozzarella sticks are ridiculously cheesy goodness and my personal favorite item on the menu - crispy, seasoned well, and come with a delicious marinara sauce that disappears all too quickly. The mocktails (a play on 'cocktails', which are sweet mixes of fruit juices and tea or soda) have forced me to completely ignore their other soft drinks. Tonight was date night and my wife wanted a burger and fries. BJ's was the obvious choice. Our waitress was nothing special, but the manager was on top of it; just as I'd finished gabbing, I'd noticed my salmon was taking a bit too long to arrive. This is when he came in and told us what was going on with my meal and offered free soup to tie me over, then dessert on the house. Holy smokes, didn't see that coming! But when the salmon came, it was devoid of anything resembling flavor. And I ordered it blackened. Oh my. We finished the evening with a delectable cinnamon bun with ice cream and strawberries on it. Once we got the tab, something I was not expecting appeared on the receipt: a recommended tip. This is the first time I had ever seen this at BJ's and I was none too pleased about it. Whether this is new policy or obvious begging from our overeager manager, I felt pressured to spend more than I'd planned, a notion alone that soured a bit of my experience. Not sure if I want to return to a place where gratuity is taken for granted. I may update this review on my next visit to observe whether or not these new receipts have become a constant.

For a $20 pizza  in that size , i would expect more than the usual amount of toppings spread out, EVENLY.  now, things get more interesting !  I find that they tend to like to find at least ""one"" piece of your add on. With our ""artichoke's""  incident . Our waiter tried to point out a small piece of onion and  then he took a closer look and said ""oh its an onion."" our waiter from yesterday , told my bf that the extra tomatoes he asked for was not the sliced roma tomatoes. however , what is on the pizza is still the ""extra"" tomatoes  . he offered to have them remake the pizza with the slice tomatoes . which my bf said "" ok"" before the waiter left he stated  ""let me go talk to my manager."" The manager came by , stated that the waiter told him that my bf  wanted to talk to him. which my bf never did request for .  The manager  told my bf that those tomatoes are on every pizza.  And I am sitting here thinking, your worker just told us that , those are extra tomatoes ?!!!! just not sliced.  So all and all , The manager gave us the pizzas for free .  Am i satisfied' on how the manager handle the situation?  OF COURSE!  HAPPY  BJING!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=220,2.92,2.7,2.7,2.804,2.7880000000000003

The heavy set manager still charged us after this long wait.  We had to request ordered drinks twice & never got them (of course they charged us). Someone ordered an extra pizooki to go after we ate ours & it never came (of course she was charged). They charged our card for the wrong amount & had to credit our card back & recharge it. He blamed it on us because we had separate tabs & it's the new waitresses fault (so unprofessional). His solution was a free pizooki. I told him we didn't want another pizooki. Then he brought a $20 gift card. Gift card? So we can come back here & spend more money? We are not stupid! I told him I didn't want a gift card because we will not be coming back. He sat it on the table & walked away. I would've tossed it to the floor but it was an employees 21st birthday & the night was already dampened enough. So we waited another 15 minutes for them to figure out someone else's tab.  My fiancé & I are both managers so we know there's a point you do what you can to keep the customer, especially when it's your fault! The correct solution would've been to APOLOGIZE & credit us back for the night, as we requested.

My friend and I used to go just about every other night during football season (seriously) because of the happy hour specials, and we made friends with a lot of the workers in the bar. Elaine is hands down my favorite bartender ever, and Kayla, Scott (who I don't think works there anymore), and Stephanie are my favorite servers of all time. Shoutout to Sunshine, too, who I've only had serve us a few times but she's always nice! The service in the bar gets a 10 out of 10 whenever those lovely people are working! I'd give service in the bar without them a 7.5, and service in the actual dining room a 6.5. It's not that the others aren't nice and accommodating whenever they see you, it's just that the orders usually take awhile and the drinks sometimes go unfilled.  I feel like the food is always hit or miss, with the exception of the Pizookie which is always fabulous. The beer and drinks are great, and usually I like to get pizza or fries to accompany them. My pizzas are either perfect or overcooked, which is frustrating. I love their pizza when it's perfect, and it's usually when I'm craving it the most that it's not. It's not even that it's a matter of too much sauce or picky stuff like that, it's just simply overcooked or undercooked. And I'm not one of those people who sends their food back when it's overcooked, because I worked at a pizza parlor and know how that can mess up the line, but it never hurts to just mention it. The crispy fries are my second favorite, with ranch of course, but even those sometimes come out a little lukewarm. Haven't had a bad experience with the spinach and artichoke dip yet, love the chips and that they'll bring you more if you ask.  Overall, I recommend sitting in the bar because the service is quicker and more attentive over there. The food isn't bad, the beer is refreshing, and the ambiance is nice.

Drinks are decent and prices okay. The one star is strictly due to their inattentive staff. The last 4-5 times I've been here there's usually one server for the WHOLE bar area.

334,Humanios ..,"San Jose, CA",8,3,8.0,1.0,2014-09-14,"So I've been to BJ's in various other cities prior to coming to this BJ's in Stockton. It's amazing how waiters/waitresses, hostess, and presumably management can change the experience. I came here with my girlfriend on a September weekend and was amazingly disappointed and frustrated with the experience. Things started pretty well, we were greeted and shown to our table with much respect, we even had a waitress who was nice enough. We received water and our food orders were taken. I ordered and Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, and she ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The chicken pita tacos comes with a side of grains which she asked to substitute with a salad. Wasn't a problem and shortly after she received her salad. This is when things took a turn in the opposite direction. No one likes to wait for their food but that experience is made worse when suddenly your server is no where to be found. Our server (Erika) never came by for another 30-40 minutes to give us any indication of whether our food would ever be coming out. At this point we assumed she forgot to place the order in. Just as we were about to get another server's attention, a different waitress (didn't get her name) came back with our food and apologized that it took long, and that my girlfriend's plate didn't have all the ingredients they were supposed to have. I assume she had other tables to wait on so she left after apologizing (on Erika's behalf I guess) that the greek yogurt was missing. A few minutes later Erika returned and apologized the food took so long. It turned out they were out Greek yogurt (topping for the pita), and rather than communicate this with us from the start had made a decision to replace it with sour cream, only after presumably waiting for the food to get cold. She also added the side of grains despite specifically asking to omit them, waste of food. Both our dishes were cold (and not very good) and she quickly exited the scene after a quick ""sorry"". We were both pretty astounded to say the least. I don't think we would've minded if they were out of yogurt if we knew at an earlier stage, but you can't just take a healthy meal, with feta cheese and light ingredients, then just pour sour cream on top instead. Those kind of decisions should be up to the customer and always communicated.  Anyways, we never received that yogurt, and neither of us finished our meals. We didn't take anything to go but were still asked for desert. No, I couldn't risk waiting another 30 minutes for our ice cream pizooki only to find that they ran out of ice cream and rather than let us know decided to let the warm cookie get cold and just put sour cream on top instead.  I hope these servers (who I'm certain are nice people) learn to communicate better with their customers. Would've made the world of difference (although the food was still crap).

For example, you can order a full order of brushetta instead of the tiny order that's on the menu...so you get 3-4 times the size for about twice the cost.

The following categorical scores are all out of 5; when combining them (weighing taste more heavily), they explain our overall Yelp rating. TASTE: 3.5 Like a good set of tires, their food is reliably good but nothing you should dream about, unless you're a weirdo.  The pizza, burgers, and calamari are items we've tried and have found to be solid.  The pizza is Chicago-style, but not overly heavy.  The burgers are thick and well-sauced; you have multiple bun options. SERVICE: 3 The servers are always pleasant if not energetic.  They don't take reservations and leave something to be desired in time management.  Expect long ques that, during peak times, can be unmitigated disasters. EXPERIENCE/AMBIANCE: 4 The general vibe is fun and relaxed.  The game is on, minus the overly zealous (drunk) fans. VALUE:  3 The prices are basically fair; no steals and only a few rip-offs.

I requested a medium rare with a Cesar salad and thin fries. I ordered a cider which was pretty good and refreshing. But $6.75 for a small thin glass. Are you kidding me? Wow! What a rip off.  Anyways, I digress, the salad shows up weak looking with lack of any real flavor or dressing. Pretty basic stuff here folks! When the bison burger arrives, it was not medium rare but instead served rare. What a sloppy ass burger, there is absolutely no love in making their food by BJ's. Bring in McDonalds or Burger King cooks because you must be using the dishwasher. Literally, must be using the dishwasher to cook the burger. Yuck! So, I ordered a new burger, all the same request as prior. Chipotle mayonnaise and Baja sauce. Paid the $23 dollar bill and even tipped the waitress 20%. Went home with the new burger and placed it on the table. I placed it on a table and took an hour nap. Waking up feeling like the time to eat is now. When I open the to go box the bison jalapeño burger is without any of the previously mentioned condiments. Just warm lettuce. Suck fest! I'm so disappointed in BJ's.

Without notice, we apparently got another waitress. The second waitress brought out our food, she was nice too until she barely even checked up on us. We had to flag her down for refills, and refills took long. When we paid, this server literally took 30 MINUTES to process our payments. Apparently she had charged the wrong card to the wrong items, when we specifically wrote on the check which belong to who. It wasn't even busy. It was a friggin' Tuesday night at 8. What we were more annoyed about was the fact that our server didn't tell us there was a problem as soon as it happened, she just took our payments and disappeared for thirty minutes. A couple years ago, my friend and I came here on New Year's Eve at about 11:15pm and were sat quickly. It was busy but seemed like most of the tables had their food already. A couple of big parties. Regardless, my friend and I sat at our table for 40 minutes without having a server serve us.

I chose the blended version (as it made any difference.) it tasted like a margarita smoothie.  Lesser note:The interior is confusing. I like eclectic, but what is this some sort of interior-fusion.

168,Casey A.,"Lodi, CA",3,54,17.0,3.0,2015-09-20,"My family and I enjoy the 2 for $25.00 meal (pizza, salad & pizookie). We come here quite often when that deal is being offered. This is the closest to our house so we typically go to this location. We had a pretty bad experience that last time we were here. So bad that the Manager sent us a $10.00 gift card to use at another time. Since the deal is being offered again, we thought we would give it another shot.  We went for dinner last Saturday. We arrived early (around 4:30pm). We were seated fairly quickly since they weren't that busy but then everything went downhill from there. Since we knew what we were having, we ordered right away. We actually upgraded our pizza to a large (for $3.00 more) and added a side salad for our son. About 45 minutes went by and then our pizza finally arrived. The only issue, we never received our salads. Our waitress never came back to check on us. The person that delivered our pizza said they would check on our salads. A few minutes went by and out came our salads and then our waitress came by to say that she was sorry that no one ever brought them out. A few minutes after that the Manager came over to apologize for the delay.  I was shocked to say the least at what the Manager had to say. He apologized for the delay and then proceeded to tell us that he could not remove the price of the salads from our bill since it was part of the $25.00 deal. First of all, we never asked to speak to a Manager. Secondly, we never asked for anything to be removed from our bill. That is not in our nature. And lastly, we did order an extra side salad and I had a soda so if he really wanted to remove something from our bill, he could have removed either one of those items. For the three of us to eat a pizza and salad, we were there for almost 2 hours. I am sorry but they did not have any large parties when we arrived so I could not understand why it took so long. I did overhear another waiter telling the table next to us that they were short-staffed and that several of the waiters were picking up extra tables to help out.

We were seated as soon as we walked in.  The server took our order, and we received our appetizer fairly quickly (15 min?). Then we waited for our entrée, then waited, then waited. Finally 3 of the 4 of us received our meal. The server told us that the cook forgot to make our fourth friends' meal, which were fish tacos. When she received her fish tacos, it looked more like a lettuce salad and 2 slices of hardened finger-shaped fish. Our other friend ordered the Salmon with asparagus and quinoa which looked nothing like the photo (there were probably 2 tablespoons of quinoa on the whole plate).  We asked for the manager, and the manager  said that the food is prepared in the same proportion all the time - which is not true because we've been there times before for the same meals and we had no issues with proportions before. The manager asked if we wanted another meal in replacement for the fish tacos - but we would still be charged for the fish tacos. My friend, who lost her appetite by this time, declined. The server returned and told us she was taking the tacos off the bill, but when we received our bill it was still on there, so we called for the manager again. The manager said she did not approve the tacos being taken off the bill, but we told her the server told us she would. She reluctantly said ok, rolled her eyes, and took the bill from the table to remove the taco meal.  Oh, and by the way...we were there for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes - from the time they opened the bill to the time we stepped out.

Finally a server arrived, so I placed my order immediately. A few minutes later she started to put a check on my table before realizing I just ordered from her.  After another 15 mins, the chili and wedge salad arrived. The chili tasted good, but was only lukewarm.  The wedge salad was mediocre at best. I never saw my server again throughout dinner and after waiting another 10-15 mins since finishing eating I finally decided I would just leave $10 to cover the dinner ($9.60 ). While I was at the hostess station getting change for a $20, the server came running with the check.

We would have ordered more but the appetizers took so long to get to the table that we figured we were spending enough. Mushrooms were ok; they were stuffed with spinach with pesto cream sauce drizzle.  I liked the pesto flavor.  Calamari was a little overdone--the marinara sauce was flavorless, but the white dipping sauce was good and garlicky.  Chicken wings were done as expected. My son had the brewhouse burger.  He said it was good. The problem was mostly with the service. We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. We got nothing for the longest time. My mom was coughing and we had to ask another wait person for just some water. And still we waited!!! Rude!!!!!!!!  Then our waitress approached the table and said she was sorry but she was really busy with a large party at another table.  My mother said we would like a different waitress then.  We still had no drinks or appetizers.   The second waitress came soon after and took our entire order again.  That is when I added the burger to the order because my son was hungry.  Then we waited some more for our beverages. Finally the iced tea came but my son's cream soda had not come. The cream soda finally came.

From all my experiences here Bjs in stockton is known for one thing. The lack of speed of service. I have come to just accept the fact that this restaurant is NEVER going to improve on that. Tonight i came here with my fiancé and two young sons meeting family for a night of drinks and appetizers, we showed up around 8 and ordered by 8:30 and boy did their slow service today really shine, by 8:55 my sons mini corndogs and fried plate came out with the flatbread pizza i ordered and holy cow were they cold. The flatbread was luke warm and very very hard and worst off they forgot my mother in laws flatbread pizza which finally came out around 9:40 and to top it off they didn't even comp it for the lack of care they put in their order. I guess they were too busy having devoted most of their servers to tending the large banquet group and forgot about the rest of the restaurant because their waitstaff was stretched thin but I've also become accustomed to that. Emily our server or Erika (not sure what her name was now) wasn't  clear and my mother in law ordered a alcoholic beverage that was far too strong and not close to what she asked for, forgot to bring my post pregnancy fiancé water she asked for to take her pain medication. Honestly im not sure if it is just this Stockton location but the food here is just awful. I only really used to come here when i worked in the area was for the wings and a handful of other items they dont even have on their menu anymore.

Ordered a Skinny margarita and Watermelon Basil margarita while we waited for our third person to show up. The first Skinny was great but the Watermelon Basil was PURE syrup. Made my stomach ache after one swig (ended up ordering a second Skinny one halfway through the meal and that one was on par with the Watermelon Basil). Received a little attitude from the server when we asked to replace the the Watermelon Basil with a Jameson and Ginger Ale, but felt justified when we over heard the waiter tell the manager that we wanted to send it back and the manager said ""Yeah, that looks really dark"".  Ordered the Ahi Poke for our appetizer and it was good. Ended up getting 2 Ahi Salad entrées and we were disappointed that the Ahi on the Poke appetizer was MUCH better than the Ahi on the salads. The Salad Ahi was slivered, stringy, pieces with goopy breading. The other entrée we ordered was the Lunch Special half flatbread/half salad. The Chicken Club flatbread was ""just okay"" and the salad was an optionless, plain, mediocre (""at best"") side. Yelp has a coupon that gives you buy one, get one entrée free from 11-3 which is restricted to one per table even if requesting separate checks.

We're talking salad dressing on the side people nothing fancy. Sometimes the food comes up quickly, sometimes it takes forever. It's frustrating, because we never know if we're going to have a good experience or not. The only reason we return is because of our son who loves the desserts.  They have an excellent drink selection, and many items on the menu to choose from. I just wish they would fix their glitches. Perhaps place an expediter in the kitchen to ensure all the orders are going out correctly and in a timely manner.

I get my sandwich, take a bite and decide to take the tomatoes out when I notice Little ITS and pieces of bacon on my avocado. Vividly you could tell they placed the Bacon and then decided to remove it.  I truly was upset because it's forbidden for me to eat bacon and for me to have to experience something that could have been prevented made me feel disrespected. Mistakes are made and can be fixed....appropriately! They could have easily just made me a new sandwich but for them to just brush it off like it's not a big deal was rude. To top it off they were not even busy, in which I don't even want to imagine what happens back there when they are busy.  So then here comes Andrew "" the manager"". He asked us "" oh is everything ok"" .. Hmm no that's why you are here? I'm thinking!!By the way he's not even standing straight or being professional he's leaning on the booth next to us, like he knows us! From what recall even a waiter takes your order standing straight up.Andrew does apologize and asks if we would like anything (later on it was a free dessert they were offering) hmm NO! No one wants a dessert, we came here for food and drinks!  In conclusion, at least I ask for my 2 mojitos to be on the house, since I longer wanted to eat! They stated I couldn't get that for free, but at least they were not charging me for my sandwich and they offered a free dessert! .. Hmm excuse me?

My one year old got spaghetti and it was nothing but noodles with a table spoon of sauce she loves spaghetti and she spit it out. My boyfriend got a really nice ribeye just kinda burnt. But the baked potato was pink and black on the inside. And he ordered grilled asparagus and it was chopped up into little half inch pieces. Nothing like the picture showed. After all that they went to remake the pizza and they brought out another pizza with pepperoni and sausage and tomatoes on it. Lol I don't know how hard it is to just put bacon and sausage on a pizza and cook it. The cooks are horrible at that place and the managers there are a joke. They were rude and all we did was nicely tell them what was wrong they rolled there eyes and walked off and didn't fix anything. For now on if I want Bj's I will be traveling to Folsom every time.

The food is consistently good and they present a wide variety to choose from.  Seasonal appetizers, salads, soups, hamburgers and wraps just to name a few.

Me and a group of friends were pretty hungry and wanted to see the final game of Copa America which this place is pretty convenient for both of those. We came in and we were accommodated with a table that can fit 8. We ordered our food and watched the game.  As we were watching the game, A lady passed by our table and fell pretty badly. She couldn't get up and was really in pain. We came by to help her up and to sit her down. What was really surprising though was the lack of attention of the workers around the area. There was 3 waiters by one of the register within eye view of what just happened and not a single one noticed it. The table next to the register had to yell at them in order to get their attention. By then, the manager came by and attended her and asked if she needed anything. He then asked around to see what happened and I guess by then things got sorted out. Hopefully that fall wasn't too bad. I think she just tripped on herself since the floor wasn't wet or anything, plus she was wearing these high wedges shoes.  Food finally came in and I had the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne to which was pretty good. Felt light and didn't came off a strong either. The one thing I really do like about BJs is their Pizookies.

138,Gabrielle Andrea Mullen C.,"Stockton, CA",221,9,3.0,1.0,2016-08-11,"I only come to the BJ's in Stockton when I feel like having a pizookie. Their pizookies are so delicious, and so worth my $7! Unfortunately, I'd still have to rate this location 1 star since their customer service is so poor. I love going out to eat with my fiance on Friday nights, and I wish that this BJs location was as good as other locations that I've been to. After a long week, I enjoy going out to dinner on Friday nights, but I don't intend to spend 35-40+ minutes for waiting on my food. I think I have been to this location about 3-4 times since we moved here about a year ago. I think the first time we went here, we waited about 20 minutes just for a server to greet us at our table, and that was after I stared people down, lol. I just didn't know who to ask. The other servers didn't want to make eye contact, or they were too busy with the tables they were serving. I don't blame them, but we sat there wondering what we should do. I even asked myself if they forgot about us! If I am desperate and craving a pizookie, I'll come here. Their prices here would be worth it if their service matched it. But spending like $60 on a dinner for two (for entrees, drinks, and a pizookie) isn't worth it to me if we gotta wait 20 minutes to be greeted after sitting down + another 35-40 minutes to get our dinner before our appetizers, plus another 25 minutes to get dessert, and another 20 after that to get the check. Not to mention last time, they brought us our appetizers halfway through our food. I also like to have my pasta with tobasco. It's simple, I know. But my point is that I didn't see my server until maybe 20 minutes after my food was served by someone else. When I needed something, my server wasn't around to ask. I gave up, and asked someone else. Honestly, I'm a pretty patient person. And it was just a shame that neither of our encounters there did we have servers that told us what was going on. I know they're busy, but each time, we probably only saw our server when we ordered, and after the food came because someone else served it to us. It would have just been nice to at least have someone just tell us one time out of our 3-4 long encounters, ""Your food will be out shortly."" Unfortunately, I'll probably still be back because I love their pizookies. 5 stars for their food & the greeters at the front!

The waiter literally threw some menus on the table in front of us, then spun around and left so quickly that I'm pretty sure the earth's rotation was slightly slowed by the momentum he generated. There was no greeting, no offer of water or drinks, and we didn't see him  (or her, I'm not sure which since they left our table so quick I didn't even get a look) for the rest of our time there. We waited 15 minutes but never saw a waiter again, so we left. The time before this, the waiter called me ""chief"" and I'm just not about that life.

The only reason why I would give it a star is because the food is always consistent here. The drinks are good as well.  My main concern is the customer service. It sure went from a 10 to none. Ive never had a problem sittint at the bar side, usually less wait.  We found sittiny easily upon arrival.  Sat there, waited and waited.  We looked around and it was pretty slow (around 130pm) so we figured service will be on our way soon. A family of 4 sat at the booth right in front of us and right away I service rendered to them first.  The waited did not make any initiation to even ask if weve been helped or not. I waited for her to be done attending the family who came after us yet waited on before us. I had to ask if we too can get service.  She took our orders and informed us that food will be right out. Im a desert  first kind of person so I asked to see if i can have my pizooky in advanced.  20 minutes later....we asked another waitress about our orders.  We ended up getting my desert with our appetizers and food with no utensils and water. (Way to go BJ's) got up and took utensils from another table When we almost finished our food, our waiters finally came back to us and informed us that she did not realize that the other waited who was supposed to cover for her never waited on us. Most of the time im well aware when waiters switch shifts or breaks, they usually inform the customer in advance.  In this case, WE NEVER DID and puts the blame on someone else...thats shitty service.

Severely Over cooked meat, 38 minutes waiting and counting on a Thursday. We waited 26 minutes for our waitress to ask us if we were ready to order as she laughed and spoke with co-workers. Drinks are great, hence the second star. Although I'll be coming back for the bar this is my last time coming in for food. I've waited too long, I've had two bad past experiences and I came here reluctantly with family and now they feel the same due to these outrages wait times. We arrived at 9:15pm today as I'm typing this review it's 10:04pm and have yet to receive food. It's about 20% full and fully staffed. I could grown the ingredients from scratch and made the food myself by now lol Update: I hade to reduce another star, I gave them two stars because at least the drinks are great. Now that's the only star they have left 10:51pm now: we have just left food arrive at table at 10:19 we finished at 10:34 and have been waiting to pay since. Natalie our waitress kept forgetting we existed, first we had to wait another waitress to call our waitress to order our food after sitting for half an hour, our food came out cold (keep in mind we sat 1:04 hr before being served), luckily a really nice guy, possibly the buss boy asked us if everything was fine. Not our waitress, the buss boy, I asked him to touch my sisters food and he said ""oh no, this is colder than ice, not cool, I'll be right back"" and sure enough he came back to our table with fresh food and even brought silverware because after asking our waitress she never brought any. When it came time to pay I asked Natalie for the bill twice before leaving. It was evident I didn't like my food I left the ENTIRE meal on the plate, did not ask for a to go box, and of course she didn't pick up on the context clues. My sister did get a box to go for her almost complete meal. When she asked if everything was great I responded ""it wasn't really good, I'm sorry"" which she apologized for but that's it. I'm never going to be a snob so I reluctantly paid for a meal which I didn't eat, or like or take with me. I picked up drive thru on the way home for all of us. The bus boy (I think that's what he was) was phenomenal and i wish I could have found him on the way out I had 40.00 for him !! As for my experience, this was the final nail in the coffin, I wouldn't go back even if I was offered free food for life. Complete dog$hit experience and food.

She brought them over within 5 minutes. Then asked if we were ready to order, we told her we needed a bit more time to look through the menu. She said ""ok, I'll be back to check on you guys"" .. SHE NEVER CAME BACK! After a 20 minute wait, I couldn't wait any longer, I was HANGRY. So I politely asked other server if we could please get someone to take our order hence we were waiting for about 20 minutes. She was nice. She apologized and said she would get our server right away. Our server was NOWHERE TO BE FOUND! Finally after another 10minutes, I saw her dealing with another tables order. The manager approached her and whispered something to her ear. She then turned around and looked at us. She continued to take the other tables order and after she was done she approached us with a HUGE ATTITUDE and said ""Are you guys ready now!?"" ..... I was so hungry that I had no time to think about going anywhere else and wait other 30min to have some food. At this point I was so annoyed by the service given to us for not reason. It was a very dissatisfied and disappointing experience. The rest is history, the food was mediocre and cold. I ordered spaghetti and meat balls and when they arrived, the meatballs were dry and cold..  Pathetic service and low standard food... OH, AND MY FOOD HAD A HAIR ON MY PLATE!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Mgr came over and said he'd comp the app. My wife's sandwich came out with burnt bread. Sent it back and the next came out with in toasted bread...this was a dip sandwich so toasting the bread helps it not turn to mush when you dip it. She was hoping to eat half and save half...we chucked the second half. The chef/lead cook came to the table to discuss our complaint, he was nice and understood. They comped the sandwich but when we got the bill the app was back on there....such a disappointment. I didn't say anything else, tipped my server based on what the total bill would have been including the cost of the comped sandwich (wasn't her fault) and left.

We waited 35 min. 1st plate was done correctly medium well. 2nd was burnt and dry supposed to be medium well with fried jalapeños. They were raw. 3rd was supposed to be medium it was also well done. We did not see our server so we flagged someone else who when we explained the issue he actually asked ""So, do you want to send it back?"" Well, duh. We watched our daughter eat her food, and waited and waited. Finally our server checked on us and we explained the issue and she said she would check. It's now been another 35 mins and still no food. Daughter is done and we have not had our beverages refilled. 40 mins and our corrected orders arrive, well kinda. My burger cooked but still no fried jalapeño. That was an easy fix tho. My husbands burger was I swear mooing. Looked like they grabbed a handful of meat, tossed it on the grill for 30 seconds and flip and serve. He ate it...much to my chagrin but after well over an hour we were both hungry. By the way anyone who doesn't know B.J.s no longer serves shoestring cut fries although they are pictured on the menu.

AND the manager realized things had gone wrong and actually comped us our pizza. Was also very apologetic. So while there were issues, the staff was aware and worked to make it all right. And the staff was very pleasant. For me that is great. It says their aim is to make things good. I've been to restaurants where things go wrong and nobody seems to care.  I have only one unfixable complaint that seems to be common to all BJ outlets. We were seated at a booth. BJ booths all seem designed with less space between the seats and the tables than other chain restaurants. If you're thin it's annoying but okay. If you have any body fat though you will end up squeezing in. Then you can either embarrass yourself by having to ask to be moved or you can sit squished for your whole meal feeling bad about yourself.

I don't remember our waitress's name. She had dark brown curly hair. I thought it was great that she asked us if we wanted separate bills, of course we said, ""Yes!"" That way we can avoid the confusion later. But heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. -Asked for 4 waters- somehow only received 3 waters. (umm, I guess I'll share with my boyfriend.) -Ordered patron shots for all the adults. First round- received some crazy ass tequila shots that was NOT PATRON. (that's okay, we won't make a big deal about it. we'll drink it anyways because maybe this cheap liq. will fuggg us up faster??? lets hope!) let's try this again, lets order another round but this time emphasize on the PATRON. Somehow our female waitress disappears and a waiter comes instead and brings us 2 shots. (how does that equate to 2 shots when there's 4 adults?) food comes, that's fine. no complaints there. Since, it was one of our friends birthday. We figured we celebrate with a Poozkie! that's pretty standard, isn't it? Waitress someone comes back, ordered a poozkie with her. I check the time. Okay, 30 mins passed, I know it doesn't take that long for our poozkie to bake. Let me ask another waiter. He finally brings it after 15 mins. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner and the kids are getting fussy. We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. We waved her down for a check. We each get our split bills and WHAT THE HELL DO WE HAVE HERE? Checks are not split, My boyfriend and I (2 adults) somehow have our friend's meals and drinks on our tab. Our friends have (couple with 2 kids) ended up having half of what they ordered on their tab. We ended up paying for what they ordered. Since it was Miri's Birthday we figured it wasn't a big deal.  Okay, long story short. Biggest grip!

Our server, Tim, made the evening for us, and since being back we have had him be our server several times, which always makes the time here enjoyable, compared to when we have been here and had a waitress who did not give us the service we were used to and we were even ignored, until we got another waitress to help us out.  The food here is very good. Flat bread or deep dish pizza, is a go to for us and I like that you can customize the flat bread pizza, Spicy pig is one of my favorites. Usually get it with mushrooms (instead of jalapeños) and BBQ for the sauce. Found out recently, it's not so easy to do with the deep dish, if it's made with a certain sauce then it HAS to be that sauce. The BBQ Root Beer ribs are delicious! Sometimes they come a little too spicy for my liking, but at the same time, the taste is worth it. Steak...yea the steaks are good. Hamburgers are very good too. Mini piezookies are a nice little treat, chocolate chip and oreo are our favorites. Also, the calamari is very good too. Overall, we keep coming back for the food and try to try something different.

At first our server Miranda took our order and then later she said her time was up and she had to leave and left us with Victoria and then with Kristen. They kept switching servers that at the end I didn't even know who was our server. So we get our food by Kristen and then she leaves and we start eating and then we all need sauces for our steaks and fries, and we call Victoria over and ask for all the sauces we need and she says okay I'll get that for you . Then 10 minutes of eating we ask Victoria again about the sauces, we are already half done with our food and it's getting cold, and she says oh the other server is getting that for you !

But then I realized there was no other server who we told about the sauces, she was the only one unless she told someone else and they didn't bring it. So I'm getting really upset because now we all can't even eat our food because we are waiting for sauces and it's getting cold and we are running out of drinks. So we are trying to at least eat while it's still warm without sauces but also mad that Victoria said the other server was getting them and she couldn't get them for us, and all she was doing was talking and on her tablet walking around doing nothing! Like getting sauces should not take that long! So then Kristen comes to our table and asks if we need anything and we say yes! We need sauces and refills , we already asked two times and we can't even eat until we get sauces and refills, our food is getting cold. So she says I'm sorry about that I will personally bring that for you. So then she quickly got that for us and asked if we needed anything else. We at least enjoyed about a quarter of our food with sauce at the end but it was already cold and we were already full! So I think Victoria needs more training on serving than socializing for too long. I was not going to leave a tip at all , until Kristen helped us although it was a little too late we still did because of her willingness to help and make it right with her excellent customer service.

The place is beautiful and looks fancy but honestly I'd rather eat at a local diner. There are much better places to eat in stockton than in this place. My first time attending BJs my friends and I were celebrating my boyfriends promotion. While in the restaurant my server was an ignorant college aged woman who decided it was appropriate to ask me rudely why I was in a wheelchair. When I stated I was battling cancer she then decided to further question my illness AND ASK ME IF MY HAIR WAS REAL OR A WIG. I was absolutely shocked and extremely upset. When she realized that I was upset she then proceeded to tell me that her grandmother had cancer and tell me I was pretty for having cancer. After this experience I absolutely refuse to ever go to BJs again. I understand that this is one server, but most of the servers there seem rude and ignorant. Fast food workers are more friendlier than these people! On top of that the food is about the same quality as an Applebee's and you're paying twice as much. The food service is slow and it takes so long to get your order.

When we finally got seated, it was next to a fire exit door. It had large, bold letters on the door, it read, ""Do not exit. Alarm will sound"" on it. The little kids seated near us didn't care, they were in and out of those doors. It was very disruptive to our dining experience. You would think the servers would attempt to remind these kids not to go out that door, but no. A female server did the same thing, except she didn't care to slowly close the door, it just slammed closed. It was so interruptive I could barely browse the menu with all the slamming and opening next to our table. Our server was very nice and attentive. At least she brightened my mood a bit. I ordered the Parmesan chicken with mash potatoes and a watermelon mojito. Loved it! Every one appeared pleased with their orders. Even my dad was full and satisfied and he's not the type of person who will order off a menu, he's more of a buffet man. Was the food worth how much we paid for? Not really.

SMH Greeted with a hostess who led us to this small as table for a party of 6 when there were tons of open booths. I don't remember our waitress's name, dont' even remember If she told us smh. Heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. Waitress asked for our drink orders and we gave her our orders but she had this hurry up and order look on her face, strike one I will let that go.  As my sisters and I talked and laughed about our lives and where we are etc... She can back rushing as to hurry up and order SMH strike 2, we ordered our main entrees, but I forgot that I did want some appetizers this bishh has the nerve to have an attitude, so I politely told her if your busy send someone else to take our orders, don't do it... I am not the one. At that point I should have just told my sisters ok this is not the place for us. I hate being rushed with RUDENESS that is unacceptable. There are way too many good eateries with better food, LETS JUST BE REAL. REFILLS - OMG took forever and we had to keep asking for refills, we asked the waitresses for 2 pepsi and 4 sierra mist,  somehow we get 1 pepsi and 2 sierra mist (umm, I guess we'll just share with each other ughhh annyoying) Waitress someone comes back, tells us shes going on her lunch break and that Tim is gonna help us Ok, we thought cool she gone and he was gonna be nicer NOPE he was just as annoying with our damn drinks.  I didn't understand what the damn problem was being that we were really friendly but I noticed all the other tables got his damn attention.   When our food arrived it was cold and bland after waiting so long then we had to keep asking for BBQ sause, extra alfredo sauce the pasta was dry as well, the  fries were as if they were sitting forever smh  AWFUL don't ask for ranch. Actually the bus boys were much more friendy then than the waitress and brought out our request with a smile.  We didn't want dessert but then decided since we hadn't tried the Poozokie lets try it, so we had to  call our waiter back now for his defense he was covering for our wack waitress, but he seemed as if OMG really...  He made a smart remark that almost got me unglued but OMG what a joke they are finally brings it after 15 mints. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner  We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. lets just pay but here it is again she rushing us to pay while we eating our dessert OH HELL NO..she so damn lucky really lucky that I didn't go 51/50 on her because of my sisters here from out of town. THERE WILL BE NO NEXT TIME MY BILL WAS $199 WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY  I don't have a problem paying for good food and good service but that was pathetic for the service we had oh hell no,  NEVER EVER WILL I GO TO THIS PLACE... That just spoiled it for me the waitress is lucky I even bothered to leave her damn tip, that is only because my nephews and daughters all work service jobs and I know its not easy for good folks to leave a decent tip.

I came in on a Friday night and considering how busy it usually is, we called in ahead of time to get our name on the list. We waited less than 5 minutes before we were brought to our table.  Our server was very hospitable, and made us aware of the deals they had going on. For instance, if you sign up and download the BJ's Brewhouse app, you get a free pizookie! It was my sister's birthday dinner the night we went, so we got 2 free pizookies that night! All our food was great. I ordered a 14 oz ribeye steak (cooked medium) and it was perfection! My sister ordered the same thing, but medium well, and unfortunately it was as dry as a well-done steak. One of our entrees took an extra 10 minutes to get to our table, so to apologize for the inconvenience, the manager gave us that entree on the house. Our server was really sweet, as she honored my sister's request to get her free pizookie without the whole birthday singing commotion. But she participated in silently singing happy birthday to my sister, haha! Good food, great service, and definitely coming back for that juicy 14 oz ribeye.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton,3.04,2.58,2.708,,2.7640000000000002
64,Jerry L.,"Stockton, CA",2,77,3.0,4.0,2017-09-26,Food ok but avoid southern foods on the menu. It tastes plain. The menu is easy to read for dyslx!c people like myself. Big bold words and huge pictures that will make your jaw drop cause it looks to real. I remember stepping out to the restroom to wash my face. When i was there were no mirrors at the urinals.

51,Crystal P.,"Stockton, CA",97,17,11.0,3.0,2017-10-12,We took my oldest niece to BJ's last night for her 21st birthday. We didn't have to wait long since it was a Wednesday night. I repeatedly told the front person we have 12 people but they still put 2 tables together with 10 chairs. Our waitress was Jessica and she was friendly and attentive. She bought my niece her first birthday shot then we got our drinks and appetizers. I always like their appetizers. My fav were the wrapped avocado and artichoke dip. There were no small plates for the appetizers even though I asked for them. I ordered grilled chicken with veggies over rice pilaf. The rice was super salty so I couldn't eat my food. Everyone else had pasta and ribs so they ate theirs. The alcohol mixed drinks barely had any alcohols in them so it was disappointing. They were supposed to bring out the pizookie after we paid but they never did. Jessica said to go back next time and remind them. I don't know if we'll ever go back though. If I'm going to spend over $250 I'll rather go buy grocery and cook for the family and chill at home. Last night experience reminded me why I haven't gone to this place for years...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=20,2.92,2.62,2.712,,2.74

41,Cara H.,"San Ramon, CA",236,8,,2.0,2017-10-14,"We went in on a Friday evening before it started to get busy but we still were waiting 20 minutes to be seated at a table- but then after we were seated we waited another 20 minutes to even meet our waitress. At this point we were already ready to order but the waitress only wanted to take our drink order to start. We insisted we order and she eventually and reluctantly took our order. The drinks arrived, followed by my dinner' side- strange. Then our appetizer arrived. Then we got our dinners. We scarcely saw the waitress. Our waters weren't refilled- only when she brought our bill. We wanted a box for left overs but our waitress never reappeared and had to corner a busboy to help who was also very reluctant to help. We left cash as we had no hope that we would see our waitress again.  This is unfortunate a very typical and not even the worst of service that we have experienced at BJ's. Wrong orders are normalcy, waitresses are often scarce, long waits to be seated receive drinks and food.  The only redeeming quality is that the food is when you finally get it. Unless they get order wrong. In that case don't expect a prompt fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=20,3.04,2.62,2.704,,2.7880000000000003
35,Charles H.,"Stockton, CA",3,96,17.0,3.0,2017-10-17,"So came here because my 8 year old niece wanted to go for her birthday and the experience was quite underwhelming.  The food was pretty subpar.  We ordered combo pizza and the artichoke dip as appetizers and they were okay.  I personally had the bacon cheeseburger with a baked potato, which was a little too greasy and the baked potato was meh as well.  Other entrees we had included salmon, which was pretty well received, shrimp pita tacos which wasn't anything special, some more pizza, an avocado wrap and some kid's food.  The best part of the meal wasn't the food, but the berry beer my wife ordered that I drank most of, it was very good.  Service was pretty slow and the Asian hostess came to our table at the end of the night asking how we were gonna pay for our meal, which it turned out she had the wrong table, and didn't even bother apologizing and just walked away.  No skin off my back, I probably won't be coming back.  All 3 stars for the beer though, it was really that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton,3.12,2.63,2.704,,2.8260000000000005
22,Paul-James R.,"Stockton, CA",59,1,,4.0,2017-10-19,"Me and my girlfriend come here for dinner many times, mostly for the drinks and the pizookies.   To start off, sometimes the hostess(es) can be a bit hit or miss in terms of being greeted and feeling welcome as we've came in before with them talking to each other with their attention turned away from the entrance; it's not too much of an issue though as we haven't just been completely ignored.  However tonight the hostess was awesome (wish I caught the name on the way out) in both greeting us and also helping us with a server issue we had so just depends on who's working that particular day. Speaking of which, the service can also be a huge hit or a big miss as well depending on who you get.  Just to get straight to the point, I believe that their waiter Miguel should be reevaluated in his customer service as he is the first waiter I've had to both: not tip at all due to poor service and request a new server which I had just done tonight.  Our first time (and really only time) we had him as our server, he was slow and barely visited our table even though he seemed very attentive to other tables around ours.  I've had to bother our runners who brought our food instead for any needs such as just a simple refill of waters, which I hate doing since the runners aren't getting the tip of my check at all under my assumption so why should I bother them and not my actual server.  I wish I could list all the other negatives in his service but it was awhile ago and was lucky enough to not have him for the next few visits afterwards, but his name stuck with me and always comes to mind as to what I should avoid when I visit.   If you want an awesome server though, Kayla and Cara (spellings for both??) are names I try to keep in mind to know when I have a waitress I can count on.  If you get them, leave a generous tip.  James as well was very attentive tonight and I wouldn't mind having him again.  And when the food does get to you, I've no complaints at all.  So yeah, I'll keep coming when I need a beer and have a big appetite; their burgers (like all of them but I wish they still had wedges) and pizzas (California Supreme is the only one I've tried but also kinda hard for me to stray away from) are usually my go-to's with their steaks as well when I feel like paying a bit more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton,3.2,2.65,2.716,,2.87

I checked in with the hostess and apparently my name was not in the system.  They stated they were trying to seat groups who reserved 24 hours ago.  24 hours ago?  Lisa never mentioned 24 hours, she stated 30 minutes.  I requested for the manager, whose name is Marissa and relayed my dissatisfaction. To her credit, she rectified the situation and we were seated within 20 minutes as opposed to the 1 hour wait.  When seated, our server was cordial and helpful throughout the service.  The only issue is we waited 30 min for our food. That might be due to us having 10 people and they were busy.  Other than the reservation snafu and waiting on the food our experience and the food was decent.  Marissa claimed she would talk to Lisa about communicating the reservation protocol.  I hope that happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=40,3.28,2.68,2.748,,2.9200000000000004
