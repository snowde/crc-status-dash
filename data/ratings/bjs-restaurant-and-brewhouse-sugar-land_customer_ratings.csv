269,Tammie T.,"Houston, TX",133,101,426.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"I'll admit, I only go here to sit at the bar and have the desserts. Occasionally, I order a beer or two. Usually, the bar is packed but I only come with one friend so we manage to squeeze and extra chair near the end.  I've had better visits but the last time I went was a little bit disappointing. We ordered our beers and the pizookie trios and they took forever. We were sipping on our beer for around 30 minutes before the pizookies came out. We soon realized why it was in there for so long. First off, the presentation of these desserts always impressed me. They always looked so appetizing. We got the red velvet, cookies n' cream, and triple chocolate. What I remember about pizookies is that they come out the perfect amount of soft and gooey and this combination with the cold scoop of ice cream on top made a delicious rendezvous in your mouth. This was not the case on this visit, as almost all three of them were over-baked and hard. My friend and I literally had to shove our spoons into them at a 90 degree angle just to be able to dig a little big of cookie each attempt. This was a sad meal, but fortunately, I know that pizookies have seen better days and will probably return again in the future. On a side note, beer does not really go good with these desserts. It just seemed like the only appropriate thing to order while we sat at the bar and waited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=240,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.54,3.2800000000000002
213,John D.,"Missouri City, TX",163,644,107.0,1.0,2012-01-09,This place is consistent all right... consistently bad.  I can't understand why the line is out the door most nights. I've never had good service (on our last trip I told a manager to get our server some help - while he was a nice guy he was clearly in over his head.) Trying to get a refill on a drink or getting the right order out of the kitchen is more than their waitstaff can apparently handle. Food is mediocre. The beer is decent (although this is NOT a microbrewery; it's contracted private label stuff) but it's not worth the wait or aggravation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.404,3.2400000000000007
347,Cameron H.,"Houston, TX",160,348,,2.0,2012-02-11,"Just wanted to post an update. After seeing the absolutely ABYSMAL rating this place had from all here on Yelp(myself included), I took the liberty of e-mailing BJ's. I basically told them it's obvious that they don't care about anything. If they did, they'd be on here looking at these reviews. Any good restaurant manager will do that. It's a necessity nowadays. I told him that the ratings, along with the stories, are absolutely RIDICULOUS. He has apparently contacted the Sugar Land locations GM and assures me of further e-mails to let me know what will happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=340,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.504,3.2000000000000006
244,Trish D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,1.0,2012-02-19,"I've been to this location twice. The first time I went, service was slow and somewhat rude, but nothing to join Yelp and type up a review about. Our second visit, however... wow. Terrible dining experience. We walked in and immediately noticed an open table right up front. We checked in with the 4 people working up front (we had to wait for them to stop chatting to help us) and then waited for 15 minutes only to be seated at the table that had been empty since we walked in. The gentleman that seated us didn't offer to get our drink order, but rather abruptly turned and jogged back to the front to continue his conversation. 15 minutes later no one had taken our drink order and we were getting ready to just leave when our waitress walked by and informed us that she would be with us in ""2 minutes.""  Evidently I glared hard enough at her to get her moving, because less than 2 minutes later a different gentleman rushed over and took our drink and food order. Our drinks showed up 5 minutes later (although I wasn't able to get any sweetener from anyone until after our food finally came). The rest of the visit was just mediocre. I had the Ahi Tuna and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, both of which were decent. My husband had the Post Roast. The meat and potatoes were good, but none of the vegetables were cooked all the way. In fact, we were pretty sure they tossed a raw onion in the mix for some reason. We stared at it for a bit and laughed it off.  So... yeah. We won't be returning. There are plenty of other restaurants in the Sugar Land area that actually work hard at keeping their customers at least marginally satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=260,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.404,3.0800000000000005

I had a California flatbread pizza. It was sort of burnt on the edges. It had a bad burnt taste too. The ingredients weren't fresh, but it is a chain restaurant. We had artichoke dip which wasn't anything special. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were stale a little. The mozzarella sticks tasted like it was frozen. It was stringy when you pull it apart like what I expect mozzarella sticks to be like. My friends had sliders and a burger. They were both disappointed and just took only one bite Very disappointing meal. It was super overpriced.

The place wasn't empty but not packed either. We got seated immediately and order our drink and appetizer. The avocado eggrolls were pretty tasty and had generous heaps of avocado in them but I'm not a huge fan of avocado myself. I ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop from the Enlightened Menu (woohoo less calories but I look like a twig so I never watch what I eat). The pork chop was super delicious! It was moist, tender and the glaze really complimented it. It came with some yummy crunchy green beans and roasted potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry and didn't have much flavor. Only one of my potatoes had rosemary on it. The portion size was just right for me. I also tried my boyfriend's ribeye steak and it was pretty charred. It was a little disappointing. I was very satisfied with my entree but our waiter was one grumpy man that seemed like he didn't want to be there and our food took extremely long to come out :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=360,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.572,2.88
326,Chelsea S.,"Sugar Land, TX",46,78,154.0,5.0,2012-04-12,"I've pretty much loved this place ever since it opened in the area. Seeing it pop up in other areas around Houston is awesome too. BJ's opened when I wasn't of drinking age yet so I never got to experience their special beers till a few years later, but I pretty much fell in love with their crispy chicken sandwich and their pizookies. So much so that it became a favorite place of mine to eat around Sugar Land. When I would come home from college on the weekends, I'd always suggest to eat here with the family.  When I saw that one had opened in San Antonio just by randomly driving by, to say I was excited is an understatement. Friends at the time had never heard of the place or ever eaten there, so my enthusiasm for the restaurant was unfounded to them. But they found my loud vocal declaration, ""I love BJ's,"" in the middle of parking lot of a small Mexican restaurant amusing, while I realized a few seconds too late what else that implied. Yes, there were on-lookers, but you know what? I'm not ashamed!  Anyways, like I said I love the food here. Finally when I was of age I got to try one of their hand-crafted beers. The name of it escapes me, since I normally don't go there to drink but it was fruity, kind of like a berry taste and I do remember that it was good. Back to the food, my favorite thing to order here and which is always default is the crispy chicken sandwich. The combination of their fried chicken strips or tenderloins, honey mustard and the cheese garlic bread roll is pretty much what perfection tastes like. So good! Their potato wedges are also some of my favorite potato wedges I've ever had in life and that's not a sarcastic exaggeration at all, I genuinely really love those fries! I also love their deep dish pizza. One of my good friends and I come here often whenever we meet up since ironically there is also a BJ's in The Woodlands where she lives and our go-to order is always a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza. It's so good and never mind the fact that we are ALWAYS starving before we go here, but it's even better that the pizza is one of the most delicious things ever. Other items I've had here are exceptional also, I don't recall ever ordering something that I didn't like or was disappointed over except maybe their special or hand-crafted sodas. Their ""cream"" soda doesn't even really taste like a dreamsicle, but more like orange fanta with a slight ""cream"" after taste. Pretty nasty in my opinion, I'll just stick to the strawberry lemonade. Certainly doesn't negate all the positives about BJ's for me however. Definitely still a favorite of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=320,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.804,2.96
265,Felyn B.,"Houston, TX",27,78,12.0,2.0,2012-05-17,"I visited the restaurant yesterday as part of an employee outing.   The reasons for the 2 stars are as follows: the host was pretty courteous in suggesting a booth even though he understood that we wanted a table for our party, the service was kind of slow when we were ready to order, my order (Salmon Teriyaki) was good, but a bit over-seasoned.

228,Marco C.,"Austin, TX",135,258,38.0,2.0,2012-06-22,"I've always liked this place back in high school (4 years ago). I hadn't been here recently, so I didn't understand the low ratings.....until now.  After being seated, we told the waitress we needed a few more minutes to think through what we wanted to order. It took her 10 minutes to come back. BJ's was NOT busy at 10pm.  My friend and I ordered two beers, and it took 20-25 minutes for us to get them. Too long. BJs, were you guys busy brewing the beer? After paying, our table should've received $5 in change in total. We felt cheated, but we thought the money went to the tip. (None of us told her to keep the change.) Afterwards, the waitress took the receipt booklets cause we had finished with them, but then she brought the booklets back so we could tip. What? Where did all the money that you took from us go?  Later, the waitress told us that they don't get paid a lot and would appreciate tip. Now, I completely understand that, and I'm actually pretty generous when I tip, but when a) the service is ridiculously slow and b) you don't return our table's change, do you honestly expect us to tip more? Based on what we ordered, the $5 was already more than what was expected of us to tip. I wanted to be nice, but I couldn't sympathize.  Should be one star; keeping at two because I've had positive experiences in the past. The beer wasn't bad, and I enjoy the atmosphere. My friends and I still had a good time. However, based on the other reviews, it sounds like everything about this place has gone down hill over time.

The servers are great but not stellar. They're good about topping up drinks, updating you on the status of your meal and making sure the food is okay once you receive it. For an appetizer, the santa fe spring rolls are a great choice for sharing with another person. They come with 2 sauces, both are delicious.  As far as entrees goes, I love the pizza there so I usually stick to it. The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is absolutely amazing and never disappointing. A small can feed 2 people so keep that in mind. I've also tried the flatbread version of this pizza and it's just as good.  For dessert, a pazookie is a MUST.

The guys that came up with the idea of BJ's made it as inviting as any warm lodge on a snowy day. Nice interior with plenty of seating, great food/snacks, huge TV's with sports and even make their own beer!  Foods: Pizza- Great small pieces perfect for the HH, and just small enough to not easily get knocked out of your hands or make a mess. A Avacado egg rolls- While this is the same stuff served at multiple bars/grills in town, I'm sure I have shamed my Asian heritage for being too weak to resist this. A Beers- I had all of it, they have samplers and full sizes. Great stuff, you can really dial in on what you like. And it's the middle ones in-case anyone wants to buy me a few pints.

236,Rachel J.,"Victoria, TX",20,56,2.0,4.0,2012-07-30,"Totally a fan of BJ's Brewhouse. We love the food - it's not necessarily inventive, but it's well done. Comfort food, if you will. I know I certainly will. I love their loaded baked potatoes and their southern fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and onion straws. Oh, and the pizzas. And the wontons. And the pizookies, naturally. There's something for everyone - and there's a wide variety of brews to enjoy, if that's your jam.  We come here for dinner, which almost always means a wait for a table, but we recently came around 2:30 and had almost the whole place to ourselves. The service is okay to good during the day - our drinks were never empty (although they got close!) and our food was well-paced, from appetizers to the meal. We did have a lengthy wait for our pizookies, but maybe that was meant to be a sign we shouldn't be ordering cookies. ;)  At night, you'll wait a little longer for service, but I've not had an actual bad experience. I do, however, think that BJ's could step it up a bit with the service times, hence the missing star.

234,Lauren T.,"Houston, TX",41,124,7.0,2.0,2012-10-20,"This place is weird. For one, it's called ""BJ's."" It is an extremely bright bar (to the point that it hurts your eyes) and it is extremely quiet. It's like a library in there! We had a late dinner/snacks on a Friday night. While crowded, the decibel level must have been the lowest I have ever heard in a room full of drunk people. BJ's brews their own beer and makes their own sodas, so maybe it's something in the beverages that keep people calm and sedate. The decor is equally weird--industrial corrugated metal accents and booths upholstered with fabric from tapestry vests circa 1990. Hurts my brain! The night of our visit we waited over ten minutes to be given menus or a greeting, even though we were seated right by the hostess stand. The waitress kept mixing up who ordered what and all of the food was obviously frozen and reheated as it came out at all different intervals. I was near the kitchen and could hear the chorus of microwave beepers going off. It's like the food you get at TGI Friday's or Chili's--corporate, processed ""product"" that was likely driven there in an 18 wheeler. Like, you could buy it boxed up at the store and make it yourself at home.  The prices for everything are pretty outrageous for mediocre-at-best food. $11 for avocado egg rolls (bland--needed salt), $5 for four tiny squares of bruschetta that equaled one breadstick, bland but well-fried mozzarella sticks for $8, and stuffed mushrooms for $8 that were really small button mushroom caps. Kind of disappointing. Equally disappointing was the beer itself. One of my dining companions ordered a beer that tasted like it had sat in a metal tank for days. It was disgusting and had a foul smell. My hubby got the berry cider, which tasted pretty good. My beer was nothing to write home about--average at best.

As far as my mom's experience goes, she has met a few friends at BJs and they can't seem to get things together.  Anything from handing her the wrong food, the waiters leaving for long periods of time without giving out silverware, pouring the wrong drinks, forgetting to bring the check, giving her food to the wrong table and so on.  I just don't get why this place is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=300,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.5640000000000005,2.88

The person I was with got 'deep dish pizza'. They must not know what a deep dish pizza is because it was ALL DOUGH...very fluffy and light (and ok, fairly yummy) dough...with like 4 tiny pieces of topping and maybe a table spoon total of cheese (you could SEE the dough on top of the pizza due to lack of sauce/cheese).

Let me quantify, FOR Sugar Land, I'll take BJ's over Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden for a non-drive through dining experience. Everything fresh, ""Chef Mic"" microwave is not ""cooking"" my meal.   If you want your socks knocked off you're going to have to drive in to town, Montrose or the Heights.

254,Justin P.,"Houston, TX",67,11,8.0,3.0,2013-05-19,"An establishment that is fairly representative of American pub fare and culture. While there are certain items that fall off the mark, there are certainly others that exceed expectations. Overall, an enjoyable option for dining if one were to decide on a restaurant that serves all manners of American bar food. I have recently just started frequenting the BJ's chain so I cannot vouch for all the food options that they offer. They do, however, have some outstanding items on the menu. They also offer locally-made in-house soda (root beer and cream soda) along with varieties of craft beer. A word of caution though - the menu is quite large and expansive. You will feel a little overwhelmed if you are not craving anything in particular. Of the items I have tried, I was thoroughly impressed with the gourmet mac and cheese. The subtle adjustments that they have made with the cheese composition along with the addition of the right amount of bacon and bread crumbs is sublime. The Chicken Fried Steak is also noteworthy. It is properly executed with the right amount of breading and seasoning and the sawmill gravy that is paired with the steak has just the right amount of salt and pepper. The deep dish pizzas are also worthy of a try. They have the right balance of airiness and crunch and the quality of the toppings is excellent. The dough also has a distinct sweetness to it that generally lends well to the flavors and saltiness in the toppings. The burgers do leave something to  be desired. They are good but nothing exceptional. I wish they were better. I do appreciate the option of choosing either wedge-cut and frenched fries as I prefer my fries a little thicker. The in-house root beer and cream sodas are also worth a try. If you are a fan of either and can afford the extra calories, be sure to give it a go. Refills are also included. One thing that I do have an issue with is the pricing of some menu items. More often than not, I find myself questioning the value of the food that I have ordered. While the restaurant certainly isn't exorbitantly priced, I feel that some items are a lot more expensive than they should be. I also find the service in this specific location a little lacking. While bar service is impeccable, the table service does leave something to be desired. All in all, this restaurant chain is definitely worth a try. I will certainly be back if my buddies decide to come here for happy hour but otherwise, I would probably go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=260,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1480000000000006,3.0000000000000004

The place is big and OPEN. The bar is to the right, the seating area is in the middle, and there's a section to the left that can be reserved for private parties. The one minor note I'd like to add is that some of the chandeliers' cords block the televisions, so be sure to sit in the bar area if you want to watch a sports game. We sat in the middle section and our server was busy but visited our table frequently. We ordered the fried artichokes as an appetizer and yowza! They're delicious! It comes with an aoli dipping sauce that I recommend you use sparingly, but it's still yum. For our meal, I ordered the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. I had to use a fork to help eat up the veggies that fell onto the plate. It was great! The bread wasn't too soggy nor was it too crispy. The vegetables were not dried out and the pairing with the goat cheese- awesome. My fiance ordered the small deep dish pepperoni pizza. Hmm... not sure what to say here because I felt torn. My family is from Chicago so when I hear ""deep dish pizza"" I think of lots of meats, sauce, and cheeses. Sorry to say but BJ's Restaurant's deep dish pizza is mostly just extra bread.

I came here the other day and had a flight to catch and had exactly one hour and our waitress got us our drinks, appetizers, food, and dessert all in that time and even gave us plastic cups we could take for our drive to the airport. My usual items that I always order are sante fe egg rolls, buffalo chicken pizza, potato skin, their baked potato, their bruschetta, and their pizookies. All those items are AMAZING and will not disappoint you! Their pizookies are really just big cookies baked and served with ice cream, but they are to die for - simple, yet so good... not sure what they put in their cookies that make them so addicting. Even if I don't have time to eat here whenever I come, I make sure to stop by for just dessert.

We drove around for a while looking for a place and he said, how about BJ's? Why not? We ordered the fried artichoke for appetizer, and it was great in my opinion but Jason said my homemade lemon garlic butter sauce is better than the lemon garlic sauce it came with :) he may be just making up for forgetting the anniversary. I love artichokes but wasn't crazy about the thick crispy breading, so I won't order this appetizer again. For the main entree, our server recommended Tuscan Chicken Limone and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Jason's salmon was full of wonderful spices. My chicken Limone was very creamy and rich but not overwhelming. The artichoke mixed well with angel hair pasta in the lemony sauce, once you add sun dried tomatoes on top, it just doesn't get any better than that! Or does it? Yes, the chicken is actually the best part. Tender, juicy, thinly pounded and breaded, soaked in lemon goodness, each little bit is a little taste of heaven. During our meal, our funny and resourceful waiter Jacob brought a sample of his favorite beer Jeremiah Red for Jason. His report on this Irish style ale is tasty, rich and smooth. We were going to skip dessert tonight but Jacob said BJ's is famous for its pizookie and how can we past that up? We ordered white chocolate macadamian nut, raspberry white chocolate, and triple chocolate. The trio did not disappoint.

The only thing that I have found not good is the watermelon mojito.  Honestly, it just sux!  The flavoring is extremely artificial and gross, and the mojito is way too sweet and lacks alcohol *tsk tsk tsk*   Service is alright; the hostess is welcoming and friendly but our server is kinda slow, on a Sunday night while the restaurant is not busy at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=100,3.6,3.18,3.18,2.412,3.3480000000000008

217,Jenny L.,"Houston, TX",30,27,9.0,1.0,2013-10-04,"Me and my friends decided to come here to relax after the end of another work week. We really like the food especially the pizookies, too bad the service was subpar this evening.  We like getting our dessert first so me and my friend ordered a mini pizookie. We got them in a timely manner but when it came to our entree...not so much. We aren't the type to complain so we patiently wait. Thirty minutes go by, still no food and absolutely no attention from the waiter or management. Forty-five minutes go by, still no food and still no one came by to give an update on our order. We finally have to flag down the waiter, Emory, and he says he just spoke to the manager and our food should be on our way.  Finally after an hour, we get our food by the manager Stephen and I ask what happened to our order. He says he had no idea and barely found out of the situation. Really? I thought the waiter had informed him of the situation. So we flag down yet another manager, Rene, and ask him what happened to our order. He has no clue as well but said he would come back to let us know.  So we have our food but empty waters and no condiments. So I literally have to walk up to Rene who was standing at the hostess stand to make the request because everyone just stopped coming by our table.  So at this point we had our food an hour delayed, no attention from managers or the waiter, no explanation, no water, & no condiments. We were very agitated so I flagged Rene down to get an explanation. Remind you, he was supposed to come back with an explanation but he was too busy playing hostess instead of being a manager. He rather chose to ignore us like everyone else until we confronted him. He finally admits the the ticket was lost in the kitchen and that's why our food was so late coming out. I get it, mistakes happen but it's the way that they are handled that rectifies the situation. The fact that we were practically ignored is where the dissatisfaction in service came from. If they had come to our table 20 minutes after us not receiving our food and explained the situation, I would not be writing such a negative review right now. Unfortunately, they decided to ignore us and that was not acceptable.  BJ's as a company needs to learn how to train their employees on customer service.

We ordered Thai Wontons, Buffalo Wontons, flat bread pizza and Thai lettuce wraps. The buffalo wontons with the dipping sauce taste exactly like buffalo wings from Buffalo Wild Wings or any place else that has the traditional buffalo sauce. Thai wontons and Thai lettuce wraps were the business. A nice sweet sauce with just the right amount of spice. The wraps had shrimp that was cooked quite nicely. The flatbread wasn't anything to brag about and I wouldn't get it again. I think it needed more sauce. So next time maybe I'll try a deep dish or traditional pizza.

Once he was done, he took our orders w/ a smile & made great beer suggestion. I tried the Piranha, which is kind of a hoppy IPA. Pretty dang on good. The fact BJ's let's you have a sample of their specialty crafts is a bonus...in fact I think it's safe to say they encourage a trial run. Why let a customer order an entire pint, only to find they dislike it, then have to pour an entire serving down the drain??? Good marketing strategy IMO.  We also tried the Black & Blue Brewhouse Burger & also some of the corn & bacon fritters. The fritters were killer!!! The aioli sauce they come with has the perfect amount of spice. The burger was ok...but then again I'd just not too long ago had that burger from Stanton's so I may be giving an unfair comparison  :-) All in all I had a good experience at this location.

189,Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",359,584,614.0,2.0,2013-12-16,"Only been to BJ's twice and my verdict is that's it over-hyped--Yep you heard right!!!! What's my complaint?  Just sit tight while I summarize my not-so-dynamite-bite: Although seating before 7 on a Friday was no hassle, the wait staff was getting hammered!!!! Everywhere I looked, the staff was briskly going from table to table trying to compliment guests and get orders out. However, going to the wrong table with an order defeats that gesture! Could it be that they got the order wrong because he or she doesn't use a notepad?!  At least in my instance it was because I receive an incorrect order not once, but TWICE!   The first order omitted my  request to add Blackened Shrimp to my Angel Hair Toscana, which looked like baby food. Poorly presented on plate with globs of angel hair and a few pieces of tomato sprawled onto the plate with dashes of olive oil. Not appetizing at all. Although the server apologized for the omission, I learned from one of my friend's mamas that you don't eat ugly food--and that Toscana was U-G-L-Y it had no alibi to be eaten for the price, so I sent it back and downgraded my purchase to a simple BJ Burger  with Bacon that my friend had ordered. Her burger looked decent and the steak fries she allowed my eat to keep my stomach from growling had a nice crispy golden crust that I appreciated, but  once my plate arrived, I was not impressed. Once again, the presentation was off for me: the meat patty was sliding to one side with a pillow rather than a bed of lettuce peeking out from the side. Other veggies looked smooshed under the bun. At this point, I wished I had convinced my friend to go to Smashburger across the street versus this massacre of fine ingredients that were being ill presented on this particular evening. Despite the sub par impression of my plate, my stomach had other desires--and that was to eat, so I decided to keep the burger and taste it. Nonetheless, my server had neglected to write down my request for mustard and burger sauce on the side. I received the ""burger sauce"" which was simply a BJ version of Big Mac sauce that was an epic failure. Secondly, I received mayonnaise instead of mustard, which further delayed me from eating my burger. By the time we flagged down our server, my burger was not hot, but at this point, I didn't care to send another entree back. I dealt with it and decided that my tip would demonstrate my dissatisfaction.   Really was town on giving my server a tip with so many errors. I parted with one dollar for a near $12 purchase since the change from my transaction was not given back to me. Although I am finicky, I do tip when I dine out because I sympathize with server wages, BUT crappy and inconsistent wait service should not automatically receive a tip. When you're almost tempted to ask to adjacent table for condiments because you cannot get a waiter's attention, I think the waiter staff needs help pronto!  Until then, BJ's gets the thumbs down and a  better luck next time if I decide to give them another chance in the future. Maybe their special spirits is tops, but their service as restaurant is not!

TO DIE FOR.  I'm also slightly obsessed with soup in bread bowls... and BJ's tomato bisque in a sourdough bread bowl is absolutely drool worthy.  Lastly, I love love love places that will substitute meat. For you vegetarians out there, get the California burger and ask for a veggie patty instead. You won't regret it!

So I finally hung up, and called back. While I was on the line with them, my mom called, saying she's there and they don't have my order. MAYBE BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET TO ORDER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON HOLD. I was SO mad. And the worst part? They didn't even say sorry. Or give a discount. I mean NOTHING. So my mom had to sit there and wait for my food. Now for another horrible experience. I went there yesterday with a small group and ordered chicken wings, and two pizza with no chicken (it came with chicken) After 30 mins of waiting, the pizza came, with chicken on it. So then he took it back, and then 20 mins later brought one of the pizza back, but said he dropped the other pizza so they're making it. So we began to eat the first pizza. My wings were no where to be found, as the waiter was also no where to be found. We had no silverware so we had to get up and get some from the other table. Not once the whole time did we get a refill. We were complaining how thirsty we were. Then 20 mins later he brought my wings, but I told him (its been so long, and I ate the pizza that's here, so I'm not hungry anymore. We're all full now so cancel the other pizza that's still cooking, and take the wings back."" There's been so many other horrible experiences too but those are just a few. As for food, the pizza is really good. The avocado rolls are okay. The French fries are really thin but good.  The jalapeño burger is good but the meat is fatty and over burnt and thick.

BJ's turned out to be an excellent choice for both beer and food.  I stopped by here a few afternoons ago on the way home from work for a bite to eat and a drink.  Once I settled in at the bar with a menu and a clear view of the happy hour list on the wall I decided I wanted a burger and a hefeweizen.  The pizza menu is extensive here but I've had so much pizza recently that I just wasn't in the mood for more.  Some of the fish also sounded good, but again I've had my fill of fish recently.  I settled on a brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese, because frankly this little girl doesn't need a 1/2 pound of burger on top of fries and a pint of beer.  The hefeweizen was the harvest blend brewed by the restaurant served in a chilled pilsner glass.  I opted for the thin and crispy fries as a side to my burger. My food and drink were quite good without being great.  Highlights included fresh cooked bacon that wasn't overdone (something all to common in my experience), gooey cheddar cheese with bite, a fresh Parmesan crusted bun, fries that weren't under or over salted and meat that tasted excellent.  I do wish that the patty had held together a little better, it tended to break apart as I handled and ate it, and I think I'm going to skip the rabbit food if I get it again.  There was just too much lettuce and tomato on this burger.  I should have asked them to bring me some mustard along with the ketchup as well.  Thank God they don't try to put mayo on a burger though.  The beer had a nice flavor and went well with the burger.  It wasn't OMG nectar of the Gods good but I would definitely order it a second time.  My service was prompt, friendly and helpful.  The bartender was attentive and knowledgeable about her product, and had a kind word for a girl just out of a hard day at work.  The decor of the restaurant was pleasant, well maintained and attractive.  It was a tad noisy inside but it seems like most restaurants are these days. The best thing about BJs came at the end of my meal.  I'm talking about the check, and I'm talking about it because it was so small.  A satisfying burger and fries, with a quality microbrewed pint for less then $15 including tip, where else can I find that?  This place has value written all over it, and it is definitely on my list of restaurants worthy of a return visit.  Good food and beer at a great price in a classy looking environment is a winning combination in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=240,2.72,3.04,3.04,2.6719999999999997,2.9120000000000004

When I finally decided on what to get I was ordering a black and bleu burger and requested the Parmesan crusted bun they listed on their house burger.  Well he says I'll see if I can do that. They brought out out appetizer which was pretty good, it was interrupted about 2 minutes after with our entrees. A waitress asked if she could take the appetizer we just got out of our way... I had to remind her that she literally just set it on the table. She replied with an ""oh yeah"".  Well she set my ""burger"" down and it was cut up, charred and on a French roll.  I told our waiter it wasn't a Parmesan crusted roll, it was clearly a French roll. So he said something like wait let me see the menu, proceeded to look at it and said ""we don't have that"". So I say okay... He asked if I wanted a regular bun. About ten minutes later he comes back and sets this burger in front of me. This burger was un carefully pieced back together from the French roll mess they had previously brought me. I told him it was unacceptable and I didn't want it... Then, and only then did he offer to get it recooked.  I have never worked in a restaurant but I don't think I could ever serve that to someone..

What was really lacking here was the food. Honestly, I do not expect much from chain restaurants, but this BJ's set a new standard of low for me.  We decided to dine here for my friend's birthday dinner. The birthday girl ordered a vegetarian angel hair pasta, I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, and another friend ordered the crispy jalapeño burger. -The angel hair came out bland, mushy, and way over cooked. Sadly, there was also a piece of CHICKEN that my VEGETARIAN friend found in her pasta.  -The mahi-mahi tasted like old, microwaved fish, and the bed of rice it came over was excessively greasy. My friend initially thought the slab of fish was a piece of bread. That is how dry and over cooked the mahi-mahi was. Honestly, it was disgusting. I have never had a problem with this dish before at other locations. I even thought I was being safe by ordering it tonight, but I guess not.  -The burger was HUGE. Our friend said he enjoyed it. I sampled some of his crispy fries and thought they were pretty good! Thankfully, the waitress was nice enough to allow the birthday girl to replace her entree. Since burgers seemed like the only thing they could get right, she got a vegetarian burger instead. She said it was much better than her pasta.

Had to wave someone down to serve us, the greeters look and act miserable and like they hate customers, bacon burger was bland, chicken Parmesan was bland, food was cold, turkey/ham club wasn't prepared as requested (& then had to wait 15 minutes more when everyone else had finished eating), didn't bring the coffee/sweetener/box/or water refills, etc. that were repeatedly requested. When I explained to the manager, Steve, my upset at our horrible experience he produced a litany of excuses - short staff, cooks with car trouble, etc. and no apology or offer of any recompense to make up for their poor performance and myriad mistakes. I told him I didn't care, we chose there due to our wonderful experiences with the chain in FL and our experience tonight for a birthday was horrible and unacceptable. He then, finally, apologized. We then asked why the club sandwich was rang up on our ticket three times. He had not planned to take off even a discount at all until I told him this place was horrible in comparison and we were all disappointed. I certainly hope they get themselves together and actually hold themselves accountable for poor performance (& and not simply try to say ""too bad"" to the customer) - there are far too many other places for anyone to settle for what we experienced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=360,2.68,2.99,2.99,2.404,2.8660000000000005

Decided to give this place a visit since they seem to have a great following but ended up being rather dissapointed. Honestly, big name pizza chains are way better. I ordered their deep dish pizza. To start off, their deep dish is not a Chitown deep dish pizza where you get a relatively thin, buttery/flaky crust and loaded with toppings. BJ's deep dish is like a thick fluffy, white bread crust with some toppings layered over it. The crust lacked the bite and chew you'd expect pizza crusts from pretty much every other pizza place in the world to have. The toppings were pretty generic and lukewarm; edible but nothing special. To put it plainly, eating a BJ's deep dish pizza is like eating a Subway sandwich that's pretending to be a pizza and that's far from a compliment. Zero stars for their ""pizza"". Service was slow and unattentive.  The restaurant has a cool vibe. Spacious, with beer and lots of screens to watch sports on. One star for the cool vibes. Ended the meal with the pizookie trio sampler. The pizookies was pretty good. One more star. Two stars overall. Would only come back for pizookies and beer.

218,Maithili B.,"Houston, TX",175,73,93.0,3.0,2015-05-04,"Went here with my fam bam on a whim. The starters were perfect! We got the spinach artichoke dip and the mediterranean flat bread pizza. Both tasted deliciously unhealthy, I particularly liked the addition of goat cheese to the pizza.  For main course, I got the angel hair pasta with broccoli, sundried tomatoes and garlic. The pasta was completely lacking in taste. I felt like I was basically eating boiled pasta with some veggies thrown in. I used up half a jar of chili flakes to add flavor to the pasta if that's any indication of how bad it was. My aunt asked for two chicken tacos without any lettuce and she literally got two soft tortillas with just the chicken. There were no red onions, cilantro, tomatoes or any additional filling like the menu had promised. When we asked the waiter if he misunderstood, he said that the filling is prepared with lettuce beforehand, so that's why the tacos only contained chicken. We would have appreciated knowing  beforehand. For desserts, we got the chocolate chunk pizzokie and ohmygoodness, all of us were clamoring for it. It was a battleground with four spoons clashing for the chocolate chips.  Service-6/10. Initially our server was pretty fast but as the evening progressed, he took 15-20 minutes to come to our table. I wouldn't have been too frustrated if it wasn't for the fact that we called out to 4 or 5 servers, all of whom promised to get our server but never did anything.  Ambience-8/10. There were ants everywhere on the first table we were offered, which made me question the hygiene levels. However, we were given another table without any fuss pretty quickly. The rest of the restaurant is pretty cool. I liked that there were TVs everywhere showing different sports.

I've come here about five times over the past few months and each time has been SO disappointing. Horrible service and long waits for EVERYTHING. I understand that they're one of the more popular places in the Sugar Land area (especially since it's so close to Town Center and the mall), but goodness...if you're gonna make your guests wait so long for a table, at least give them good service. Servers always take around 10 minutes to come greet you and take your drink order. After that, it takes another 10-15 minutes just to get your drink (I ordered a water each time). The last time I went, I ordered a strawberry mojito and it took 20 minutes to come. I get that the bar can be a bit hectic but keep in mind that this was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't that packed. Then, as soon as our server drops our drinks off, they're gone. GONE. I always have to flag down my server just so I can put in my food order. So beware - it will take you approximately 20-30 minutes before you can actually order your food. Then after we were done eating and ready to go, the server was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes, she showed up and we asked her to split it since we were all paying separately. All we ordered were 3 waters, 3 drinks from the bar, and 2 desserts...yet it took forever for her to bring the checks to us, forever to pick up our checks after we put our cards/money in there, and forever for her to bring it back for us to sign. I don't suggest coming here if you're looking for a quick meal AT ALL. Now the food...their pizookies are absolutely DELICIOUS. I've tried almost every one and have loved them all! Their appetizers and main dishes are all pretty tasty too! Don't get the fried beignet though, it's not that great.

There are a few things I really enjoy about this restaurant: 1) the deep dish pizza, 2) the Pizookies (OMG salted caramel), and 3) the fairly interesting selection of house beers. All three of those things happen to be their signature items. As an added bonus, 4) the menu is about 500 pages long, so it's group friendly as far as selection goes. They offer a selection of perhaps 10 different beer types, so you can generally find something that pairs well with your meal. Get a flight to sample your favs. My husband loves to start with the avocado egg rolls, which are basically avocado bites fried in egg roll wrapping and served up with a dipping sauce. (Personally, I prefer the potato skins.) The deep dish pizzas are unlike others I've tried - they're less pie-like and more pillowy, which I adore. My favorite is the Pepperoni Extreme, which has sliced, diced, & julienned pepperonis. A small (6 slice) can definitely feed two people; order a medium (8 slice) and you'll be taking home leftovers. And fiiiiinally...the Pizookies. Usually I don't order dessert, much less a cookie, but this....this is different. The warm, gooey, caramelized-on-the-outside Pizookie is to die for. The salted caramel flavor is my absolute favorite, but the triple chocolate and white chocolate Macadamia come in close behind. You can get a free mini on your birthday, too! I've had other items, like the burger and the deep dish ravioli (which is more like a lasagna baked in a pie-like pan), and they're solid. But they'll not why I keep returning.

The ambience of the restaurant is great since it gives off a casual and comfortable, yet classy feel. There is a huge variety in the menu---ranging from various flat breads pizza, deep-dish pizzas, burgers, tacos, seafood, and salads. Last time I was at BJ's, I ordered their bison burger, fries and cheese sauce, and a chocolate chip Pizookie for dessert. Their bison burger was good (though I must say i've had better bison burgers at actual burger restaurants, but that is to be expected). Their fries and cheese sauce was also a nice side to share. The cheese on the fries also had some spice added to it, which was a plus. My favorite part of my visits to BJ's is the dessert! I absolutely enjoy their Pizookie--which is a ""hot, out of the oven, rich and delicious, gluten-free cookie topped with  vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish."" It sounds simple, but it's truly an amazing way to end the meal. I like how there are several cookies you can choose from. So far I've tried the chocolate chip cookie, and the cookies 'n' cream cookie and they were both great! The Pizookies vary in size---meaning you can get a small-sized Pizookie (good for 1 person) with 1 ice cream scoop, or you can get the larger-sized Pizookie (good for 2+) where the cookie is larger in radius and comes with 2 scoops of ice cream. If a group/party wants to go out to eat but some members of the group crave different types of food, I would suggest BJ's to them since the menu covers a wide-variety of food.

We figured this would be a great place to grab some drinks at the bar and utilize one of their many screens within the restaurant. I started off by ordering a drink, one thing I did not like off the bat is that they do not list the prices for cocktails on the menu, which I'm definitely not a fan of. I prefer to know how much my item is going to cost and not be blind sided when my check comes. I ordered the Tickled Pink because of how tasty it looked on the menu. When I received my drink it looked nothing like the picture! There was no garnish and the fruit that was supposed to be in the drink was left out. When I tasted the drink it was disgusting as well so I sent it back and ordered the Strawberry Splash. The description described it to be a frozen Pina colada like drink with strawberry purée. Again disappointment, while the appearance this time was much better the texture was a let down. There were chunks of huge pieces of ice throughout my drink as if it was not mixed well in the machine to have that smooth frozen drink consistency. Plus I could not taste any alcohol, definite waste of $9. Definitely not worth the money I payed. Onto the food, I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger with thin cut fries. It was honestly nothing to write home about, I have made better burgers at home. I did not like how greasy my burger patty was it tasted like grease when I bit into it.  I have eaten at several BJ's locations and this by far was the worst experience I have encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=60,3.36,3.12,3.048,2.7560000000000002,3.2160000000000006

The salad was excellent and was only 590 calories.  Everyone else ordered hamburgers. The talk of the table was the hickory brisket and bacon burger. They all raved about how good it was.

The other three large parties got their meals before us. One of the people in our group didn't even get their food and eventually the manager gave it to her to-go. It took 45 minutes for our cards to be processed. During this time the other three parties got their desserts and checks and left. Once we got the checks back we were STILL waiting on our dessert. We asked for it to be taken off of our checks. We wanted to go home. It took ANOTHER 30 MINUTES to get our checks back. They tried to appease us with small coupons for a free pazookie AFTER you but a $10 entree. Pathetic. The waiter was working hard, but towards the end I get like he just gave up trying for us. Especially after every other large party had left and the restaurant was nearly empty. I didn't even want to ask for a to go box in fear of how long that would take.

Our waiter name was Lawrence (Caucasian guy covered in tattoos). I'm not sure if he was having a hectic day, but he did not care for our table at all. When we ordered our food and drinks he acted as if we were all talking to him at one time. He will continue to say ""hold on , let me take everything down"".  This man never checked on our table to see if how our food was or to see if we needed anything else. Lawrence paid more attention to the table across from us. He would literally refill all their drinks quickly, constantly check on them. Maybe Lawrence wasn't in a good mood, because he would continuously walk past our table and give us a quick glimpse and did not say a word to us. My friend had to get the manager twice because we were not getting any assistance. Once the manger came to our table apologizing for her employee behavior. The manager was extremely nice she got all our tickets ready so that we can leave. Crazy thing is, Lawrence added extra drinks and food to our table bill. Once the manager was getting the ticket I have not received my food, at this point  it's been a whole hour. The manager was able to take my food off my ticket for the wait.

No worries. I next tried the Hopstorm IPA. Much much more of what I was thinking and looking for. I ordered the Avocado rolls, the Root beer ribs, and some peppered boneless wings. All were incredibly delicious. The beer and the food never bothered me about this place before. It was the service. This time I saw 2 managers and both of them were extremely polite and made themselves present which I feel sets a great example. My server John F. was also awesome in more ways that one.

Although reservations aren't allowed, they let us call 30 minutes prior to arrival to be added to the wait list. When we got here we waited barely 10 minutes! The place is packed with the weekend dinner rush so waiting 10 minutes is a win in my opinion. Our table was extremely sticky. Not a pleasant feeling.  It is good for large groups, lots of choices for everyone. Since the menu is endless, our waiter was helpful with recs. He was also attentive to refills for our drinks. I got the Chicken Parmesan per his recommendation. Substituted the broccoli for mixed vegetables. I was hoping it would at least be decent. I didn't finish the dish. It's extremely salty. I sampled other dishes (New Orleans Jambalaya and Clam Chowder). Both were also very salty. The fried calamari tasted old and over fried. With such an extensive menu from a chain restaurant, I expected quality would be subpar. Prices are pretty steep for the quality that you'll get. I mean it does tell you something when they give out promotions like ""$10 off $35"" deal.  They give free birthday pizookie. Best part of the meal! I've tried to replicate this at home cookie, but it's just not the same :(  There were a couple of pros (pizookie!) scattered throughout the experience so 3 stars from me.

The texture and appearance just looks like little flour bugs, but because I wanted to be healthy, I shrugged it off and went ahead and ordered it. Whatever they cooked the quinoa in, chicken broth or whatever, made me forget about my thoughts of eating tiny little bugs! It was so flavorful! I loved the flavor of the chicken and the mushroom, tomatoes and spinach as well. I think they should add more of the veggies though especially if it's considered an ""enLIGHTened"" favorite, but perhaps it's because I ordered the lunch portion. Seating was quick, even exactly at 12pm. Waitress was nice, checked up on us a few times - average service.

It's a high school homecoming night kind of place so try to avoid it when these high school students are prone to be there.  Went again a second time and the servers just stood around and stared at people walking in to be seated. The servers stood around and conversed with no worries about their patrons. Please have mercy on the adults at least, the high school students take that bs thinking it's on par with a steak house or something but we ain't them so please step up the management and learn how to run a real restaurant.

11,Natalie R.,"Pearland, TX",3,17,12.0,1.0,2017-06-22,"My experience last night at this location was terrible. My server was Alexsandra B (that's the name on the receipt, she never actually introduced herself).  Let me start by saying my friends and I attend this restaurant often. The location is convenient for all of us and the pizookie is usually what gets us in, and the food is usually good too.  We went to the restaurant to catch up with each other. Our server was friendly but every time we wanted another drink or an appetizer we had to flag her down. She would constantly go to the tables on both sides of our booth and we would try to catch her when she dashed by. We finally caught her again when we were ready to order our meal.  We must have waited close to 40 minutes for our food. Please keep in mind that it was after 10 on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't packed at all but somehow we continued to wait. Not once did the server come over to check on us, ask if anyone wanted another drink, or to give us an update on our food.  Finally one of the guys from the kitchen brings out our food. It was cold. Not cool, but actually cold. My friend ordered a pizza, she had to wait another 5 minutes for Alexsandra to bring her a plate. When my friend got the plate and grabbed a slice there was no gooey cheese coming up, her pizza was also cold. When the guy brought the pizza he brought it out with the pan carrier (that's used when the pizza is sizzling hot so they don't get burned) he could have just used his hands. This pan wasn't even warm. It seemed like the food was just sitting there in the back. If it's late night, and I assume you want to go home, wouldn't you get this food to the table asap? That's clearly not there logic.  Once again the server never came to check on how we were. We were annoyed by that point and my friend flagged her down for boxes and a pizookie. She paced around for a while, I believe at one point sitting at a booth on her phone. We got the check and soon left.  Fast forward to this morning, I woke up with diarrhea and vomiting everywhere. Haha! Guess who got food poisoning!  I'm beyond disappointed with my experience last night. Next time we good out I'll be sure to suggest a different restaurant. There are way to many awesome restaurants in this area, to settle for poor customer service and food that will get you sick. Please do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.4,3.41,3.152,2.9800000000000004,3.406

6,Nathan W.,"Austin, TX",325,64,143.0,4.0,2017-06-25,"If you've never had the pazookie, you haven't lived  Food: 3.5/5 There's a wide selection here. 75% of the time I go for the pizzas because they're great for sharing at a good price point. My dad always gets a chicken salad. Their chips and dip are a little disappointing, mainly because the chips are sometimes stale. But the deep dish pizzas are pretty solid. Crunch crust with a chewy, bready middle with plenty of toppings and Parmesan/chili flakes on the side. Can't go wrong with that.  If I was just eating their pazookies, it'd be 5/5. Those things are fresh and melt in your mouth. Chocolate chunk is your classic, but I really really love their monkey bread as well. It's AMAZING!!! Service: 4/5 Today we had a really awesome waiter, who I'm sorry I can't for the life of me remember his name. He was an older gentleman who calls himself the biggest clown in the restaurant, but he cracked jokes, made us feel welcome, and we loved him. Had a great experience! I don't think I've ever been disappointed with service. They're timely and attentive. Atmosphere: 4/5 It's clean, it feels a little classier than your typical dining experience with your darker ambience and wood furniture. There's a bar with sports on the tvs scattered around. A little something for everyone. Bathrooms: 3.5/5 Gendered communal bathrooms. Not dirty! Pretty standard, and they match the aesthetic of the restaurant. Price: 3/5 It depends what you get. I'll admit, a lot of their main dishes cost upwards of $12, which is a bit much for me. But like I said before, I always get the pizzas for sharing so I end up paying around $8-10 per meal. What's great is they always have a lot of deals going around (check their social media). Today we used a BOGO entree coupon from their Facebook as well as the Father's Day VIP card that gives 20% off every visit from when you pick it up on Father's Day to July 9. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I've been coming here more and more in the recent years, just because of their amazing deals.

Our server made our night much more memorable..friendly,energetic and on top of the game! no need to remind him of any of the multiple requests we had that he immediately provided....this doesn't happen often, especially on a Friday night.

Thanks to Brandon for his impeccable service and drive. This is the place for us from now on, also very reasonable, considering the quality of the food...I spoke to the Manager because is usually the person I look for when the experience falls short...they deserved the 5 stars...I would choose ten if available considering we were there on a Friday at 7:00 when the restaurants can't manage to deliver this kind of service......Kuddos!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=100,3.44,3.4,3.152,3.572,3.4160000000000004

So I express my non satisfaction with my server who was so kind about it. She calls the manager over and here's when I have an issue. I explained to the manager about my meal, he sits in my booth and begins to try and justify this shitty burger. ""Oh the batter must have fallen off"" ""oh this burger is just not my favorite"" ?????

After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were told the kitchen was backed up, but fortunately we were not ""hangry"" or in a rush. When my pizza finally arrived I noticed that the cheese was just barely melted on the top as I could still see shreds of it in certain spots. The crust also could have used a longer bake time since it looked pretty white and doughy. I guess they were rushing it, at least it still tasted good.

24,Misbah V.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,5.0,2017-11-01,"This is a great place to eat out especially on a game day. The staff is very friendly and service is quick. They also have a great bar. Their pizza is great and very fresh. The best part is the dessert which is the main reason for me going there. If you go there, getting a pazooki is a must!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=40,3.88,3.43,3.176,,3.6100000000000003
3,Diana A.,"Houston, TX",71,328,346.0,3.0,2017-11-11,Better experience today than previously. Ordered tomatoes with mozzarella & clam chowder soup. Both were good. It was not packed when we arrived at 11:30 am. There is plenty of parking near the front and also some spots get shade. Two person booths are comfortable. You can bring a light sweater if you get cold easily.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.8,3.41,3.172,,3.5660000000000003
2,Kristen U.,"Los Fresnos, TX",284,33,1.0,4.0,2017-11-24,"Was very satisfied with the food and the customer service was amazing. I ordered the California chicken club with sweet potato fries and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. My fiancé ordered a BBQ burger with fries. Both were extremely delicious. We also ordered a Cookies & Cream Pazookie, and it was HEAVENLY.  We left our server a large tip because he was excellent. The staff at the front were excellent as well.  Highly recommend this facility for all! It was a tad bit pricey, which is why I did 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall-- a wonderful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.76,3.4,3.18,,3.544
12,Alexa B.,"Missouri City, TX",323,7,,3.0,2017-12-10,So I haven't been to BJ in a while but I usually like the food. I think it's over priced for the quality though. Their pizzas are the best thing here. When I arrived I was given a dirty plate. Lol wat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.68,3.42,3.184,,3.5240000000000005

63,Bunny V.,"Houston, TX",6,26,11.0,2.0,2017-12-18,"We go to this restaurant a lot, knowing how bad the service is but I just love their thin pizzas. We came in after the lunch rush and more than half of the tables were empty. We order our drinks and they come without napkins, as coasters. Our pizza comes out from the deliver staff with no utensils or napkins. Our server walks by us just eating and dropped crumbs everywhere but never stops when we try to get her attention. I end up giving up and walking to the station where they keep napkins and plates and get my own items. I sit down and she must realize it and drops off 2 utensils. We never get drink refills. We have to ask for a check as we are sitting with empty drinks and an empty pizza tray. If you want decent service, this isn't the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=20,3.52,3.42,3.18,,3.4600000000000004
19,Caroline K.,"Sugar Land Town Square, Sugar Land, TX",154,1,,1.0,2017-12-28,If you're looking for a place with even close to OK service DO NOT COME HERE. Multiple times have had to get up and leave because it took longer than 15 minutes for anyone to even come to the table. This location SUCKS with service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.52,3.41,3.18,,3.454
68,Leslie C.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"The single reason I'm giving a one-star review is because of a server named Taylor who treated us with a shocking lack of professionalism. We love BJ's and know that the Pearland, Willowbrook, and League City locations are great. The food and the other staff at this location during this visit were also outstanding. But this young woman shouldn't be in a service position. She ignored us for as long as possible, glared and avoided speaking beyond what was absolutely necessary, and after we'd been waiting for quite a long time at the table, another server came and explained that he would be taking over for her. We had not been anything but friendly and polite, so we were baffled by this treatment, which was, trust me, nothing but rudeness. We'll certainly return, as we enjoy BJ's and have never had any other problem. But if we return to this location, I'm definitely going to request anyone BUT Taylor. You might want to do likewise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=20,3.52,3.41,3.172,,3.454
0,Gianna O.,"Sugar Land, TX",57,465,642.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"We have been here a few times now and each time the service has been very friendly and the food consistently good. It looks clean and the wait, with the exception of weekend nights, has never been very long.  The menu is pretty big and covers most food categories. On our latest visit, we began with fried cheese curds and spinach stuffed mushrooms. Both were quite good. I especially liked that the mushrooms contained artichokes as well as spinach. The cheese curds were soft and squeaky and very tasty. The drink I ordered was the Blood Orange Pom Sangria. The orange slice served on it was not a blood orange but it was still very good. The neat thing about this drink was it contained Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey which I had never had before. It was sweet with a bit of cinnamony heat and cooling citrus. I recommend this as a drink to try.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It's light but flavorful and is served with cheesy mashed potatoes, broccoli and a Chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Also ordered was the Spicy Pig Tavern Cut Pizza. It's like a thin flatbread and very crisp. This one has ham, applewood smoked bacon, pineapple and jalapeño. The other dish ordered was the Southern Comfort chicken sandwich which has crisp fried chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, sliced ham, alfredo sauce and a Dijon mayonnaise.  My extreme sweet tooth kind of demands dessert so I got the chocolate chunk cookie Pizookie, a sizable chocolate chunk cookie served in a round pan like a deep dish pizza and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Very enjoyable! The meal was good and we never felt rushed. We left quite full and satisfied.  If you don't want much of a wait make sure to get there from 5-5:30 PM or at least before 6PM on weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land,3.48,3.44,3.172,,3.4560000000000004
