192,Jen F.,"Dallas, TX",2,27,4.0,4.0,2012-01-09,"This has to be my favorite chain restaurant ever! Having only been twice before, after an amazing lunch experience yesterday, I can't believe that I forgot how good BJ's is. I had one of their flatbread pizza and salad lunch combos, which was very good and affordable ($7). The salad had a tasty vinaigrette dressing and the club pizza was crisp and perfectly seasoned. Also, the calamari was outstanding, as was my husband's jalapeno burger (which I managed to snag a bite of before it was devoured). Our waitress was incredibly sweet and refilled my sweet tea several times without missing a beat. But the absolute best part of the DAY was the cookies and cream pizookie we had for dessert. To call this thing a ""cookie"" would be a gross understatement. Think the texture of a perfectly cooked brownie, mixed with the taste of a not-too-chocolately cookie fresh from the oven, then add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a hint of cookies & cream, and that still won't do this dessert justice. I definitely recommend BJ's as an easy settlement to the endless ""Where should we go eat"" debate, as their menu easily accommodates a range of taste preferences (and vegetarians). But I would also (will also) swing by on those ""I just need a pick-me-up dessert"" days too.  Don't hold BJ's chain status against it. It really is a wonderful restaurant, by any standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=180,3.72,3.48,3.48,2.576,3.5760000000000005
191,Ted S.,"Austin, TX",2,29,,3.0,2012-01-10,"This is a good place to eat ""good"" food.  It's not fancy and some things I find questionable in popularity.  I was told the deep dish pizza was quite good but found it way too doughy.  The avocado eggrolls are really good though and so are the salads.  In my experience eating here, seven out of ten times I have experienced a good quality/value/atmosphere.  The other times not so much....but it's just a chain so my expectations aren't really too high. One thing that I did find really annoying is the policy on call ahead reservations.  My family arrived without reservations one busy evening and I was told that the wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine.  I expect a plus or minus of a bit, but when 30 minutes passed and I asked about our table, I was told that several parties that had called ahead had arrived and our place was taken, (at least four times) by these other parties.  Our wait time was about 50 min.  We never would have stayed had we known our wait time was over half an hour.  I think it best to either have a reservation policy or don't, but don't punish waiting customers by extending their wait times more than double the initial time estimate.  If it wasn't for the starving kid we would have left.  It's a good place but not much more than a 20 minute wait kind of good. The same night we had the long wait was one of the three times that was really poor in terms of both service and food.  It appears as though they can't handle busy.  If they aren't overly busy it's three stars and if are it's one to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=180,3.72,3.48,3.48,2.476,3.5760000000000005

185,Daniel M.,"Austin, TX",0,29,2.0,4.0,2012-01-30,"My wife and I will go there probably more than any other place if we are just looking to have a night out. Love the TVs they always have sports tuned in and if you sit in the bar area most of the time you can just walk in and sit. They do get very busy in a flash so not always. They also have a reservation number you can call if you want to make sure you have a seat when you arrive. Very polite and accommodating staff.  The last waiter we had seemed nice enough although maybe overwhelmed in the rush that arrived shortly after we did. I only say this because we had to flag him down more than once which I don't like to do...I understand getting busy but never forget about a customer! This is not the norm here but was worth mentioning. I love the selection of beers they have: lights, darks, exotics (or seasonal), They have always been informative when I wanted to try something new, explaining the favor and such.  The food is pretty good overall as well. My personal favorite is the Chicken Alfredo!! So good! This last time I got the Parmesan crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked really good, soft and moist with a lemon sauce that was perfect with it. The potatoes, while real, left something to be desired because they had no flavor...throw something in...cheese, butter, salt, anything. My wife really enjoys the lettuce wraps on their appetizer menu. The artichoke and spinach dip was awesome, a must try. I don't even like spinach and I enjoyed this dish.  The deserts should be world famous if they are not now. The P-zookie, oh wow I love this dessert so much. be warned it is great but very filling and rich. A warm chocolate chunk cookie on a warm pan with vanilla ice cream on top.  I will continue to enjoy this Restaurant and recommend it to others as well!

316,Eva G.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,1.0,2012-02-18,"I was recently extremely disappointed with my first attempt to visit your restaurant. My family came to Austin for the wknd & we hoped to treat them to your spot. I have a 2yr old & imn7 months pregnant so I hoped that arriving at 6 & being told we only had a 20 minute wait would make for a good experience. However, after waiting an hour and watching several large parties get seated before us because they called in, I asked to speak with a manager. His response to our situation was they are trying their best but we still needed to wait for 2 additional large parties to be seated. This is in addition to the hour we already spent waiting. If we were told upon arrival that our wait would have been so long we would've decided against it, but we foolishly waited w an infant & toddler thinking that we would be seated ""soon"". I'm terribly disgusted with this experience & will express my opinion online so other families might save themselves from miserable family evenings at your venue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=300,3.6,3.45,3.45,2.148,3.5100000000000002

Nice place.  I ordered one of their pasta dinners and the pasta was pretty raw. The noodles were stuck together and crunchy. They fixed it and brought out a new order after the other people at the table had finished their meal. Then I ordered a second beverage and ten minutes later the server came and said there was trouble with the pump and the beer was coming out too foamy and they had spent the last ten minutes trying to figure out what was wrong.   All I can say is my first experience didn't leavee with a good impression to want to return any time soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=320,3.56,3.45,3.45,2.3440000000000003,3.494

The fries that came with it (you have the option of thick or skinny, I had the skinny) were the best part of the meal, nice and crisp. People around me had pizzas which seemed satisfactory. I can't say this place is better than any Chili's/Applebees/TGIF type of establishment.

170,Claud Byron Y.,"Lenoir, NC",23,20,4.0,4.0,2012-05-09,"After having driven past this place a few times, and having my curiosity peaked, I looked at their website and found that they have one of my favorite items:  Micro-Brewery selections!   My Wife recommended that we stop by and I was all for it.   When we arrived, we were greeted very politely and professionally and shown to our Table. The setting was very clean, the noise level was very nice for the time we were there (Approx 1pm).   Our Servers name was Lisa and she was such a cutie.  What a wonderful personality and very friendly.  She kidded with us and helped us understand the specials and Beer of the Day selections.  She made us feel very welcome to be there. The food came out fresh, hot and plated well.  My Wife ordered one of the Personal Pizza's and it looked great, and tasted great also.  She enjoyed both the size (Not too big, not too small, Just right!), and the Flavor.  She also had one of the Peach Beverages and she mentioned that it tasted very good.   I ordered the Bacon and Bleu Burger with wedge fries and I couldn't have been happier with it.  The Angus beef was done to my liking and the flavor combination was great.  Sometimes you get a burger like this and they tend to put too much Bleu Cheese on it and it gets overpowered.  This wasn't the case.  It had just the right amount of cheese, and bacon to make it a very enjoyable burger. Again, what made our visit to BJ's so enjoyable was our Server.  Lisa was funny, cute, entertaining and knowledgeable.  Her smile was nice to see, and it was real, not just for our table, but all the time.   When we dine out, whether it is a fast food stop, or a more elegant dining experience, or anything between, it's always a joy and a pleasure to have a positive experience across the board.  For this, we want to thank all the Staff at the Brodie location for showing up with their A-Game and making our visit fun, positive and enjoyable.

312,Mindy P.,"Austin, TX",1,11,,1.0,2012-07-02,"The atmosphere was good and the PM porter beer was great. The service by our waiter was wonderful. However, the steak I ordered was not cooked as ordered. The manager brought the food out as the waiter was busy. I told her my steak was not cooked as ordered and that it needed to be cooked more. I like my steak medium-well or lightly pink in the middle. When it came out, it was bleeding on my mashed potatoes. She took the plate back to the kitchen and returned in less than 2 minutes. She started off by saying that the next time we come to Bj's, I should order my steak well done as they go by temperature. She then proceeded to say that the steak temperature was 148 and that is medium well but that she had them put it back on the grill for a minute. The correct temperature for a steak to be medium well is 155-165 per several websites and other cooks that I know. The waiter was appalled and said that he goes by color. There is nothing on the menu the doneness is determined by temperature. I assured that waiter that it was ok as it was not his fault. However, the manager and her attitude sucked.

286,Q J.,"Austin, TX",0,60,,1.0,2013-03-25,"I first visited this place a while ago. I honestly don't recall how things were except that their wedged potatoes were very greasy and salty. Went there for lunch again today with a group of people and I don't think I want to return, even though the French fries on some plates looked much better than the wedged potatoes. Service -- Laughable. Apparently another guy at a different table ordered the same item (half pizza with side salad). The kitchen screwed up and plated the whole pizza on one plate. And apparently the plate was set in front of the guy before the wait stuff realized the mistake and snatched it up again. Anyhow our waiter brought me the plate (with the whole pizza) and told me about the mistake (including the fact that it was rescued from in front of the other customer). He then proceeded to suggest he would half the pizza for us and bring me a side salad later. So as I watched he took the pizza plate to a table, slid half of the pizza onto an empty plate, and then? He brought me back the original pizza plate, half of which was occupied by the half pizza and the other half covered with crumbs and remains of the other half. It looked as if someone has eaten half of the pizza and handed me the leftover! Come on, what kind of restaurant does stuff like this? I understand mistakes happen, but at least he could have taken the pizza back to the kitchen and ask them to divide it and re-plate. I've never had a bizarre experience like this! Food -- I ordered a lunch special, a half roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread pizza and a side salad. The pizza barely had any very thinly sliced zucchini and was very lightly sprinkled with tiny bits of goat cheese. They used quite a lot of pesto to compensate for the lack of topping. So basically I got greasy flatbread and pesto. The side salad was as basic as it could get, bunch of wild greens with 2 very sad looking tomato wedges. The guy sitting next to me ordered a regular deep dish pizza, presumable lunch size. When they bought it to him I thought it was a joke. It literally looks like something from a kid's menu, actually smaller than the kid size pizza in many other places. For that one they seemed to use extra oil  soaked into the crust to make it up for the tiny size, so hopefully the guy didn't walk away from his lunch still hungry. Never going back there.

We decided to give this place another try and besides we were only going in for dessert and drinks. My family and I had finished a night of shopping and decided we wanted something sweet to wrap up the evening. First, I must say the bar area was hopping and the dining area pretty empty for 9:30pm. We were seated with only ONE menu and it took the server 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. When he finally graced us with his service we each ordered water and as I began to ask him a question about a sparkling strawberry bar drink he cut me off in mid sentence and said in a frustrated tone ""I'll be back, let me go get your waters!""  He returned another 6 minutes later ONLY to quickly drop the waters and run off before we could even make eye contact much less order anything! As my 6 year old daughter went to take a drink of her water she noticed lip stick on the rim of her glass and realized the glass was too heavy for her to pick up and slightly spilled some water on the table. She looked up at me and said ""Mom, why didn't he give me a kid cup with a lid?"" GREAT question!!! After another 3 minutes we decided we didn't want to give this guy a single cent of our money. From my observation, they pay more attention to their bar patrons than their dining patrons. So we jumped up and went next door where we ended our evening with satisfied bellies and great big smiles!

93,Ella D.,"Plano, TX",1323,419,1599.0,3.0,2013-08-12,"Eh. More like 2 1/2.  First, the rant: Service at the bar was egregiously slow. And the bartender we had has a habit of printing out your tab after EVERYTHING you order and putting it in a rocks glass right in front of you. We seriously thought we were being cut off and closed out after ordering a first round. We had to ask him what was going on and he said he does it to avoid discrepancies or confusion about tabs. Which we read as: I've had arguments in the past with customers about tabs and this is how I make sure you know what's on your tab at all times. Hint: this is uncomfortable and a bit rude - and unnecessary. He reprints the tab every time you make an order and puts it right back in front of you.  If you do it for yourself, then keep the tabs in your book or your apron so that if a customer has a question about what you've charged, then you can refer to it. But this is an extra step you're taking time to do that potentially makes customers uncomfortable (it's pushy and it makes the tab / money a focal point of the experience) when you're already weeded. Stop it.  That being said, the bar stools were probably 3/4 taken and the dining room was starting to bustle, but there was only one bartender who wasn't a pro at multi tasking to begin with. Now, the goods: I've never had their pizzas but the ones I saw coming out looked appetizing enough. We ordered just beverages and two appetizers - Chips and Salsa and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Of the two, I found the chips & salsa more remarkable. But to be fair, my friend loves the egg rolls and always orders them. I recommend ordering them with ranch dressing instead of the dipping sauce it comes with (which is very sweet) Now, that being said, I actually have to say their salsa is pretty darn good. A mini bottle (two pours) of Chandon is only about $8.75 and they have a decent wine and very nice beer selection.  They have a kid's menu which, for a sports bar that's leaning upscale, was unexpected to me. I've had lunch here in the past with my daughter who loves their pinwheel potatoes (their version of fries... and that's not what they're called, it's just how I remember them.) Also, if you order the chicken tenders, they're made fresh, not frozen and nuked... I know this because I once had to send them back as the centers were pink. The entire meal was replaced instantly and we were perfectly taken care of, so I had no problems with them and appreciate that they make these from scratch.  The big shout out I have for BJ's? Best damn Ranch Dressing I've had. I'm serious. I don't know why. In the past, we've asked for extra to take it home in ramekins.

The first time was for a business lunch, in which I ordered a turkey burger, which was grilled and came with fries and was a hefty portion size for around $10.The burger was very scrumptious and juicy no complaints here and the fries were hot and crispy. The service was good for a busy lunch rush. The second time was within the last 3 weeks with my family which include twin babies and some friends. I had the Rib-Eye steak which was a very tasty 14 oz steak I had medium well. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The service was good. They had enough space to accommodate my babies . The restaurant was busy and perhaps that contributed to the server forgetting the drink and dessert I ordered. However, I still enjoyed the experience, nothing like good company and good food to compensate for inconsistencies in service!

LOL  My family and I go here from time to time and I like this place. The Ambiance is nice right when you walk in. It has a modern wood feel to it. Also there are TV screens around the walls and bar area, but they are not overwhelming for others who do not wish to watch them. The beer selection is massive and they brew a lot of their own. I think I had the porter ale that was pretty damn good last time. Calamari appetizer is very good and tender (breading not too heavy). Their burgers are really good and I order them here a lot. They are flamebroiled and always come out tasty. I have also had the shrimp tacos that are good but not enough food if you ask me. On the down side: Menu is too big. Its hard to navigate the whole thing and seems like its all over the place. Also sometimes when busy our waiter has taken a bit longer than normal (as to be expected), but has happened to us a few times so had to mention. Lastly some items are way overpriced.

49,Deniz V.,"Austin, TX",96,577,274.0,4.0,2014-03-07,"Really probably a 3.5, but what the hell.  After all, they have beer and pizza, so they've got that going for them, which is nice. This place definitely feels like the Chain restaurant it is, but I will say, I love their buffalo chicken pizza which I've had maybe a half dozen times or so.  It's deep dish, which typically is not my favorite style, but they do a great job with it here.  The dough is really fluffy and soft on the inside and it has a nice lightly crusty exterior to it and tastes very fresh.  The toppings with celery, chicken and buffalo sauce drizzled on top really make it.   The only time I've ventured outside of the buffalo chicken pizza, I think was to get the avocado rolls appetizer which were pretty terrible.  It was basically a wonton wrapper stuffed with unseasoned avocado and then fried.  Overly creamy, and not seasoned or balanced in any way.  Just mushy and warm.    Their beers here are about average in terms of craft beers, but they are all very drinkable, with nothing so crazy that you have to just sip and don't really enjoy slinging back.  I'd definitely get the sampler flight to try them all and see what you like. Service is typically average.  I definitely enjoy the usual here, but can't really speak for anything else on the menu and at a place like this, I'm not really too interested in trying everything out anyway, as it's all pretty ordinary stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=60,3.44,3.31,3.31,2.352,3.362

I'll touch on my last experience which was very recent.  I ordered the balsamic chicken for take out, and what I got was a disaster. I got overcooked frozen chicken thrown on a plate with cold and uneatable mashed potatoes. (I don't know how you can mess up mashed potatoes) on the side was three or four pieces of soggy lettuce and some soggy cold onions. Zero ""crispy onion strings"" like it says on the menu. The worst part about it all was the heaping amount of sauce in, on, and around the food.  This was downright the worst $16 I have ever spent, and not my first bad experience with the food here. I'm not one to normally one to heavily criticize restaurants, but beware the food here has been very low quality in my personal experiences. I hope it has been better for others. But I will definitely not be coming back. REVIEW UPDATE: I was politefully contacted by the owner who reached out an apologized. Such a nice gesture that I decided to go back and see if I could have a different experience with this place. I did. I ordered the same dish and got an incredible clean hot and (fully loaded with crispy onion strings) version of the balsamic chicken.

117,Shani S.,"Austin, TX",438,514,442.0,1.0,2014-04-16,"So, we made reservations for a Friday evening.  We show up and let them know we are there (at 6:50) for our 7pm reservation. Let me preface this by saying that my aunt is handicapped and that standing for her is very hard.  Also, BJ's is packed with children running about.  Ok, back to my experience.  After letting the hostess know that we were there for our 7pm reservations, she tells us it will be about 30 minutes before they can seat us.   Uhhhhh  What? I ask her ""What is the point of a reservation if we still need to wait the 30 minutes to be seated?"" She doesn't even respond, merely rolls her eyes and walks away.  Awesome.  My aunt and uncle arrive.  There is no place for her to sit, as all the seating is taken up with other families waiting to be seated.  Maybe they had 6:30 reservations?.... I help my aunt over to what I am hoping might be a safe zone and stand with her and chat.  Well, I sucked at the whole protective barrier thing, as a small child comes running by and almost knocks her down.   I love kids, don't get me wrong... I don't like parents that can't teach their children to maintain a behavior suitable to situations.  This is isn't a park. Shaken, I help my aunt to a bar stool that my uncle has grabbed and we seat her quickly.  A man, whom I will assume was the manager, then stomps over and says ""You can't let her sit there!  This will not do.  Move that stool now!"" I explain what's happened to my aunt, that we're trying to help her, our reservation issue and he scowls at me and says ""Look, I said this won't do.  Move her.  Now."" ""Where would you have me put her?  Let me know if we can sit somewhere else and I'll get her there, sir.  I just want to make sure she's comfortable and safe."" We help my aunt up, move the chair.  I turn to ask him again where we should go and he has stomped off.  Nice.  I am totally in love with this joint so far.  Finally, we are seated at 7:38.  Awesome.  We are seated at a circular booth.   A waitress comes, takes drink orders and disappears.  About 30 minutes later, we get drinks.  The place is packed, I will say that.  Lots of families... lots of families.  My mother gets her wine, white, as well as my aunt.  My mom's white wine is warm.  We wait another 20 minutes of flagging down the waitress for her to come over.  She then argues with my mother about what the temperature of her wine is.  At this point, I hate this place and I want to leave.   The menu is overwhelming with a million different things to order.  It's like a Chili's or Cheddars. I chose the grilled chicken.  Oh, look, it's previously frozen, shaped chicken.  Yum. Let's just say, I will never return.  The people there are not so nice and the food is not so awesome, either.

Upon our first visit there last June, we had a terribly rude waitress, not sure of her name, but she was blonde and oblivious. Our pizookie came out completely raw (I love chewy cookies, but with this one- I'm talking warmed up cookie dough), so we sent it back. She brings us our check and takes the pizookie off of our tab...but not another pizookie like we had asked. I left a note on the receipt saying she had ignored us, and while we were waiting patiently for a pizookie from the to-go area, our waitress COMES UP TO ME like a girl in high school and tells me if I would have just ""confronted"" her, she would have solved the issue. No apology.  Fast forward to April, when we were in the neighborhood, were starving, and my boyfriend just wanted a burger. We go in, sit down, and after 10 minutes of waiting in an EMPTY restaurant, a familiar looking blonde girl comes over and awkwardly asks for our drink orders. We go ahead and order, and I try to be polite and friendly just in case it wasn't the same waitress. Even if it was, I would still have been kind, you know? Well, the next morning my boyfriend is missing his debit card. We call BJ's and the manager insists there are no cards with his name on it. Fishy, since we know for a fact we didn't drop it after coming home. A few days later, mysterious charges appear on his card- at the HEB on South Congress, the Whataburger off of Ben White, and Exxon gas station in the area- come on. If someone were to snatch it from our side of town, they probably would not have been trying to use a stolen debit card SURROUNDING THIS BJ'S. Who it could have been that stole the card there, we don't know. Absolutely AWFUL establishment. We'll be chewing out the manager shortly and writing a report to the company.

Both times I didn't receive happy hour prices. Tonight I requested my bill be adjusted and when he brought it back, only two of three items were corrected. Rather than wait another 10 minutes for the server to come back, I just paid and left - feeling ripped off since I'd gone there just for their specials. Why bother have a happy hour if the patron will leave less happy than when they came in?! Pros: Food is decent for a chain. Servers were always pleasant, just way too many tables. Clean environment. Good beer selection. Cons: 20 minutes from the time we sat down to even see a server is ridiculous. The food arrived before my drink order! Plates were never cleared from the table on any of my three visit. Messed up bills on two of my three visits. It shouldn't take 90 minutes for a beer and an appetizer on a Wednesday night.

I, however, always go for the soup/salad combo, with my soup being in a bread bowl. The first time I ordered it, they brought out my salad with my soup, about 10-15 minutes before my boyfriends entree. Even though I made it clear the soup was my entree. I asked 2 questions, (politely) 1. Why did my salad come out with my soup? And 2. Why did my entree come out before my boyfriends? The server apologized and said it was a mistake. I waited until my boyfriend got his food and then ate (amazing food of course)  The last time I got this soup/salad combo, last Sunday night (oct. 4th) the same thing happened. Maybe it's just their thing to send out one persons entree before the other, and with an appetizer ( the salad) however, since the first time my server told me it was a mistake, I kindly told the food runner "" oh I didn't know they would come out at the same time, I thought the salad would come out first!"" And the food runner was very snotty and said "" THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!"" And sped off. Such a jerk. Again, I waited to eat my food until my boyfriend got his. The server heard me talking about the situation and understood why I was confused and said he didn't know why the establishment did things that way. I honestly have never seen another place that doesn't 1. Serve the salad first and 2. Serve all the entrees together......although the server was nice, it took 10 minutes to get greeted, another 5 for drinks, and a very long time to get the bill.

Hostesses don't smile, look bored and like they hate their jobs. Servers are very inattentive and I often see them standing around chatting and flirting with each other.

A.

He then returns with a fork, no setting with napkin, just a fork, which wasn't exactly clean.   We finally order a few things to share , stuffed mushrooms , Brussels sprouts and lettuce wraps.  My friends husband order the deep dish ziti as well.  The food came out quickly enough only to find a very long blonde hair baked into the cheese on the ziti.  Needless to say, my appetite along with the person who ordered it , was completely gone.  Eventually, the manager came over And generically apologized to the wrong person in our party either way she offered a free dessert .   I've never been a huge fan of BJ's anyway, other than the pizookie, the food is salty and overpriced , but this experience has cured me from chains for good .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20,2.96,3.04,3.216,2.244,3.0080000000000005
18,Katie W.,"Austin, TX",4,27,10.0,1.0,2016-05-23,"Damn it!!! I used to love BJs so much! When I lived up north, the one on Mopac was my go-to for datenight, and for afterparty deliciousness. The avocado egg rolls were so addicting, it wasn't fair. Flash-forward to last night, I might as well have lit $40 on fire and flushed it down the toilet. I ordered avocado eggrolls, calamari, and a pulled pork sandwich for pick up. The calamari was chewy, bland, and soggy. The avocado in the avocado eggrolls was black and the wrapper was soggy.  Don't even get me started on the pulled pork sandwich. The meat tasted like it was cooked a week ago. In good faith, I tried smothering it in bbq sauce, but the rancidity was overpowering. It was just too far gone. Everything I ordered went in the trash.  In all honesty, I can overlook the sogginess of the calamari and eggrolls, because when you put hot food in an air-tight plastic container, it's going to steam. But the blackness of the avocado and the taste of that pulled pork will haunt me in my sleep forever.  I hate it when something that used to bring you so much joy goes so far south. I used to love BJs! DAMMIT!!!! (I can't say that without giggling just a little bit, but I'm still angry!)

84,Amanda B.,"Austin, TX",2,4,,1.0,2016-05-26,"This review is mostly for experience. I've been to just about all of the bjs in Austin.. But this one can't seem to get even close to good costumer service. NEVER ORDER TO GO!!! Unless you want to pay for things you don't even get. They have left things out of my order every time I have gotten food. But to last night. I came in to order because last time I did curb side and called it took them 20 min to bring me my ice cold food. I went in and waited for ever because some blond guy at check out couldn't get the lady in front of me checked out. Hers ended up being 50 flat and she didn't tip. So I went to check out and started looking through MY OWN ORDER instead of the employee verifying I have what I paid for. I kindly informed him he forgot my items and it's been consistent here. He did apologize and got me a soda while my boyfriend and I waited for them to fix our order. Again that I paid for. To come to check me out and put my food in the bag to tell me to ""have a nice day, not that's completely sarcastic I hope your day sucks"" in such a fake sarcastic voice, yea that's what an employee said. You want to know why?!! Cause the woman in front didn't tip. I left him like 10% tip on my receipt but instead of looking at the things he didn't finish he just automatically assumed that one was mine. I even tried to explain to him that receipt wasn't mine it was hers. He didn't even care to listen. I let it go because he didn't look fully there..I should have gotten a manager. So embarrassing there were people all around. By farrrr the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant industry. Will be talking negatively about this restaurant any time asked. Will not be coming back . And I'm writing a letter to the corporate office. You guys need to get your to go ordering fixed. And loose the assholes that you hire. Just cause that's the only job that they can get. They need more experience in costumer service. This guy wasn't new or anything cause he did chime to me well I hope that wasn't me who had messed it up before he started being rude.  If there was an option to rate no stars or even negative that's what I would truly be rating. Don't come here unless like I said you want to pay for things you don't even get, have cold food when you get it, be mistreated by staff, then be treated like you owe them something more just because they fixed your messed up order!!!! So ridiculous and could definitely express way more on how frustrated I am at this specific business. No wonder all the bjs are popping but this one hardly packs full. Unbelievable and will be spending my money else where. I've easily spent a few $100 here on prior orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=100,2.8,3.02,3.192,2.34,2.9320000000000004

11,Debbie T.,"Austin, TX",39,5,,3.0,2016-07-16,"I have never disliked this restaurant, but... I tried to order tacos on corn tortillas, because I cannot have wheat without risking getting sick, and they only had flour/corn mix.  In Austin, where there are high numbers of gluten free people? In Texas, where we have amazing homemade tortillas (flour and corn!)?  I ended up quickly picking a salad from the menu because I was clearly holding things up. I did not like it and did not eat.  By, the time the waiter came back, my companion was done with two bowls of soup, and I did not want to make him wait for a new order, so I ended up not eating dinner. Poorly played, BJs. You have to pay better attention. I do not tend to like chains, so we may call it done. And, we got our check from our waiter before all the food was out. WTH? Who does that?  I eat out a lot... high end, dives, and everything in between. I have literally never seen that. A clear unspoken message...""get out."". Of more importance than the minor disappointment over fish tacos that I really wanted, that was the message we got from the time we ordered drinks until we left. Are we holding you up?   The hosts were great. The waiter needs to smile, be helpful, and generally act like the customers are not an inconvenience. It was not crowded, they did not need to turn tables...and he still ushered us in and out like it was McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20,2.92,2.98,3.184,2.572,2.956

We waited for over 15 minutes and nobody came to even take our drink order. I walked over to the hostess stand to let her know and she could care less. She told us that we could sit in a different section. So, we moved to another section.  We sat down and noticed that a couple who were seated after us were greeted by the server and he took their drink order and didn't stop by our table.  At that point it was 1:22pm and still no service. We got up and told the hostess again that nobody came to the table and we wanted the manager and she said they were busy.

When it finally arrived one entree was missing.  The waiter didn't say a word so I assumed it was coming shortly.  15 minutes later I was finally able to flag down a waiter (not mine)  to go looking for it.   The manager agreed to comp my missing entree and it finally arrived.  Over cooked and looking like dog food.  I eat the edible parts and gave the waiter my credit card so we could get out of there.  When I received the credit slip they had added another entree to the order as well as taken one off.  So the manager had to come by again. At this point I expect something else to come off as a nice gesture but alas.  I guess he figures well never be back anyways.   I've never done this before but I ended up leaving no tip.  I'm sorry but if you deliver food to only two out of three people at a table you should have a bit more of a clue regarding what's going on.  If I'd seen the second waitress that actually did something I'd have tipped her...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=40,2.52,2.92,3.164,2.5000000000000004,2.7600000000000002

62,Bruce B.,"Austin, TX",4,39,7.0,2.0,2016-09-08,"Gets 2 stars only because the bar area is so cool and nice. I love the 4 tv's and the bar top is classy looking. That's about all I can say here that's good. Came here a couple months back for lunch and the server charged me the dinner price for the lunch special. When I mentioned it she said she could fix it, I told her not to worry about it because I KNOW that the first preauthorization for the first charge wont go away from my account until 4 or 5 days later which makes that money unavailable to me until then. She insisted that wouldn't happen, so like a dumb dumb I listen to her and she came back with the correct amount but sure enough I now have 2 charges for similar amounts on my card. It is extremely aggravating when I know I'm right and a server insists I am not, and I end up being right. I pull up my account on my phone to politely show her how credit card preauths work, and explained that just because you void a preauth it doesn't make it go away from my account immediately. This is why I wanted to just pay the overpriced incorrect amount because although it sucks to be overcharged, it sucks even more to be charged twice for a period of 5 business days. Then the server explains to me that she has had a rough week because a family member died and that she isn't all there this week. Awkward to tell a stranger. Came here today cuz coworker insisted cuz bday. I ordered fried chicken w gravy and mash. The gravy is not gravy, it's an oily type of sauce with a strong, unpleasant, and indescribable taste which covered everything and left that aftertaste after every bite of chicken and mash. Mash was a GIANT lump of dried mess. I asked server Kyle for some brown gravy to moisten that shit to make it edible (cuz hey I paid for it) but they didn't have brown gravy. I did not want anymore of the oily stuff they call their white gravy. So I just stopped eating all together. Kyle was very well-mannered server but when we tell you we just need an extra minute to decide on the menu don't leave us there for 10 minutes on our lunch break dude. Cmon. Place was empty (late lunch) and he was nowhere to be found most of the meal he spent a lot of time in the kitchen for some reason. Kyle charged my friend $4 for the soup when the menu said $1.50 as an add on for lunch. We showed Kyle and he said ""Sorry I never work lunches."" Kyle I don't think you work at all. Service ain't in your wheelhouse broseph. As I said before, very well-mannered but not a good server. Came here about a year ago as well to watch a ball game and the deep dish pizza was all bread in there, no toppings other than that first layer. Cool bar to have a beer and catch a game but not to eat. Menu looks so freakin good but when you get the plate it just sucks and only decent service I've had is when I sit in the bar section. Too many good places within throwing distance to eat for this kitchen to suck in its execution as much as it does. Doc's has great burgers and beer specials, Tarka Kitchen for some good Indian, and Carino's for some good pasta. Sucks to pay $15 at BJ's and still leave starving. None of that food is sitting well with my stomach either as I type this. Prob the mash cuz it was so dry it had to be old or frozen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=40,2.44,2.93,3.172,2.7280000000000006,2.734

BJs looks like it is trying to be a Cheesecake Factory, but maybe they should spend less money on the decor and more on the food. I got the fish and chips and clam chowder. The fish was clearly frozen fish. To make it worse, it was overcooked, dark brown (despite being called ""blonde"" fish and chips), and greasy. They gave very few fries, and the ones they gave me were limp, soggy, and also greasy. I ordered the clam chowder, which also was clearly not made fresh. The bowl was about the size of a cup. It was thick like paste and had very little clam. My boyfriend had a burger, which was nothing special. Everything was just bad. I guess we should have anticipated it wasn't going to be good when it was ready in just 15 minutes. Save $30 and buy yourself a box of Mrs Paul's and On-Cor Salisbury steaks at the grocery store.

69,andy c.,"Austin, TX",6,5,,1.0,2017-05-21,"Me and my family have been going to this location since it opened. Granted it's probably been about 6 months since we've eaten there,but we decided to get some take out tonight. Turns out this was the worst idea ever. The food was a pure disappointment. For starters,unripe avacados were used on my sandwich,this was a chicken club with really oily and greasy bread. The point of a club is to be a healthy option. Saturated fat isn't healthy at all. Then to add the fact they took away the option of wedge or thin fries,to only be replaced by a single fry option(which they were overdone and flavorless) I wanted wedge fries. I'm positive I'm not the only one unhappy with this change. My next complaint is the ""avocado egg rolls"". Egg rolls are supposed to be crispy. At least firm if nothing else. What we got was a soggy,greasy,brown avocado mess. I couldn't even finish the one I started. Then whoever the genius at corporate who decided avocado is going to pair up nice with a sweet soy dipping sauce was dead wrong. We hoped the sauce would help the failed frying attempt. Wrong. It only made it worse. Needless to say,that whole appetizer went straight to the trash. Then my wife's prime rib dip(which is fair sized sandwich) came with a 2 oz to go ramekin of au'jus. What we have normally received with this order in the past was at least 5oz Togo container of dip. The only thing we ordered that came anywhere close to acceptable,was the kids spaghetti(which was still a bit greasy for pasta sauce). But this should be expected to the fact it's pretty hard to mess up spaghetti. Also the kids apple juice was prepared way before our arrival,so all the ice had melted and it was a diluted mess. Luckily the girl at the Togo counter dumped it out and made a new one for us. So in all,I think it's safe for you to assume the conclusion that we won't ever eat there again. Since their obvious recent menu change and apparently a poor decision of a chef/executive chef who can't assure the highest quality food leaves their kitchen,then you can bet we won't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=40,3.12,3.07,3.144,,3.09
