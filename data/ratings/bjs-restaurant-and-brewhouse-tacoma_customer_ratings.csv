179,C P.,"Tacoma, WA",129,228,93.0,2.0,2012-01-09,"Well, gave this place another shot. I ordered the sausage/garlic deep dish pizza and the other one got a bleu burger. He specifically asked it medium rare.  Low and behold, food comes out and the burger is well done. Told the waitress that it was well done, she just said ""ok"" and went to the back. So neither one of us thought she went to the manager about the well done burger. One of the bartenders came over and I told him about it. He walks to the back and a manager walked up. She tells us that BJ's was going to comp the burger.  I'm glad that they comped the burger but seems every time we got there, something always goes wrong at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9520000000000004,3.5600000000000005

208,Kim P.,"Tacoma, WA",169,509,42.0,4.0,2012-01-30,"So people compare this place to the Cheesecake Factory and I can see why! First off would be the booklet of a menu they hand to you, GEEZ! It's actually pretty similiar and so is the options available inside.. Lots to choose from which gives the staff time to take care of the other plethora of customers. Yes, the restaurant is quite large and decently full as well, especially during peak hours! Service here is good, the restaurant is still pretty new to the area therefore, Tacoma has done a good job with not downing grading this joint, yet! The interior is dim and DAMN shuffle as you walk, I thought it was just me the first time I came but everyone has the same story about the floor here and how they damn near bit the dust and actually of few of my gals have, LMAO!!!! It's located adjacent to the mall so parking can be horrendous, so plan ahead.  The bar is pretty awesome, especially the HH menu and service.

The menu was chalk-full of tempting items, but I settled on one of their specialty pizzas, and my friend got a salad. Oh my gosh, that pizza was huge and oh so filling.

BJ's still provides great service and has the friendliest bar staff and wait staff. The food is alright, and the beer selection is broad and likely to please any palate.  But last time we went to BJ's for lunch, my salad was pretty alright, until I got under the top layer of nice lettuce.. The bottom of my salad was all old, brown, tiny pieces of lettuce as if I literally got the bottom of the barrel. Ewww. Also, they do not take reservations, but you can call ahead to get in line on the weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=220,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.0200000000000005,3.6800000000000006
176,Jay W.,"Tacoma, WA",8,41,1.0,2.0,2012-02-11,"Great food, but that's about it. The service is just terrible. The menu is overpriced. They rarely get your order right... as you can tell, I am not a fan of BJ's. We go here (unfortunately) because my girlfriend is a huge fan of their pizza (admittedly, I am too) but I still cringe every time she suggests it.  To start, I can think of at least 3 separate occasions where we asked for a high chair for our 2 year old and ended up sitting with him at the bench seat because they did not bring one. Not to mention we always seem to get 2-3 different people waiting on us per visit - seems a little bizarre.  Now the food - don't get me wrong, it's reallllllly good. The problem is that they rarely get things right. I'm not much of a finicky eater - just give me meat and cheese and im set - but my gf is allergic to things and only eats specific things (a waiter's nightmare, I know!) They, of course, don't seem to understand this concept. When we order a pizza WITH something added, we never get it - and have to request it a 2nd or 3rd time. When we order a pizza WITHOUT something, you can bet it's there.  On top of all this, it's astronomically priced. I believe we were told it was what, $6 to add chicken to a pizza? Seriously??? ... and that's if they even remember to put it on! On top of all this, I rarely ever get more than a single drink refill when I order refillable drinks instead of beers. All that, and I've never had a bill from there that was UNDER $50. WOW. What a rip-off.   My preferred way of eating BJ's pizza is from my home, in the left-overs box, when someone else paid for it.  Imagine how much pizza you could get at Cloverleaf or PSP for $50 - with the correct toppings - and less brain-dead service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=180,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.8880000000000003,3.5600000000000005

We ordered our meals and they came within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the chicken marsala and wasn't really impressed, but it was still worth eating. My boyfriend ordered a balsamic vinaigrette chicken meal and it was really good. Then we had dessert and left. All in all this place was nice. I liked the atmosphere and everyone that we came in contact with was really nice. Our waiter was a little weird, but super nice. The cost is a little more than we usually like to spend because there is normally three of us, but I would say it's worth it!

She informed us that they do not do reservations. She said we should call ahead and come in early. So we did and the 30 minutes she quoted us turned into 1 hour and 45 minutes. WTF??? We asked how come the time jumped so much? She informed us that they had taken a lot of reservations. Apparently you can make a reservation if you have 10 or more people. Thanks for the info dumb-ass we had a party of 12. Lucky for BJs the numbskull management some how was able to hire excellent servers to make up for their shortcomings. Our server was Kelly and she was fantastic. She made my beer sampler just how I wanted it ( this is usually against the rules) she got all the different bills right, made change, and dealt with us drunkards with a smile on her face.

I actually like the tuna tartare which is often difficult to get at a good establishment.  The tuna is not the greatest cut, but it's decent.  It does, however, have great acidity, sesame oil, yum and yum. The tomato, mozarella salad is pretty tasty, too.  I also liked the pork sliders, parmesan crusted chicken, pizza, and beignets are good.  Oh, don't forget this peach cocktail they have.  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=220,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.2800000000000002,3.5600000000000005

I can say their fish and chips were average at best, a somewhat thicker mushier crust with less fish than you would hope for.  Same goes for the calamari.  The presentation was very nice but it came out lukewarm and sort of soggy vs. fresh and popping.  Our server was excellent so no issues there.  A good food stop if you are at the Tacoma Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=200,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.8920000000000003,3.6800000000000006

Omg its been 6 months since the last time I had it, and when I got it, I just engulfed it. I'm not even kidding. So what the pizookie is a cookie, in this case I got the red velvet and there's no other flavor to go, but yes its a cookie with vanilla ice cream. You have no idea how good it is till you try it.

Well in that case, this particular outing, I ordered a Wildberry Mojito (first time trying one) and I ordered the Scampi Pasta which I have to say was amazingly delicious (: For my dad's birthday not too long ago, I made him shrimp linguine which almost tasted the same as yesterday's dinner (: Surprisingly, the pasta was not the usual ""over-done oily"" that I despise when wanting to order a pasta dish. I really liked the crumbly things sprinkled over my whole bowl of noodles. The two sticks of bread, I was not particularly fond of. My friends' ordered the Hawaiian Maui Maui which... was WAY SMALLER in portion than we had expected... of course pictures on a menu is deceiving at times. The Maui Maui fish was ... quite salty and I could barely taste the pineapple fried rice that had been buried underneath. My other friend had ordered the Salmon and Lobster special on one of the separate pamphlets tucked inside the menu. I think the salmon was a little well done for my taste. I would give 3 stars for my friends' dishes but I give it a 4 just because I liked my previous experience here and my mojito was good. Because I haven't tried a mojito before, I was expecting tons of minty flavor but got mostly sweetness out of it.

We had the deep fried avocado eggroll appetizers, which were in a word: weird. On the one hand it was an interesting application as avocado typically isn't served warm. But the sundried tomato and pinenuts didn't really add much to the dish. The dipping sauce was some sort of brown sugary concoction that I didn't recall seeing in the menu description. Didn't really pair well. For dinner I had the Angus Pot Roast sandwich, or rather that's what I order but I got the Angust Pot Roast dinner. Not a big deal but I was pretty clear in what I ordered. The meat and potatoes were great, but I recognize the meat as a pre-made product or something very similar to it, so no credit there. My main gripe was with the ""oven roasted vegetables"" that came with it. Not sure what they were thinking serving carrots that had sat on the line so long they got that chalky white surface appearance. Especially when it's paired with onion quarters that have been cooked so little they not only have no caramelization typical of oven roasting. But celery sticks that look more at home on a chicken wing appetizer. No kidding, they were just cut in thirds celery sticks that you dip into ranch in between shitty fried chicken. Both celery and onions were so under cooked and raw I had to borrow my girlfriends steak knife to cut the things. I'm not expecting much from what equates to a bar version of an Applebee's, not much at all really, it was in the area we were shopping and were starving.

Originally this review was going to be three stars due to the wait for a table, the fact that the portions of food were very small for the price, and the fact that they brought my mother-in-law the wrong dish (she ordered the fish and chips, but was brought the shrimp and chips instead), but once we sampled the fish and the fries from my mother-in-law's plate (once they brought it out) ... well... WOW.  The fish was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of batter and crispiness, and the fries were well-seasoned but not overly salty, and crispy.  All three of us agreed that it would be worth coming back just for the fish and chips, it was so amazing! I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, which was very tasty, but I wish that we'd ordered an appetizer or soup or salad as well, because it was very small.  However, it was packed full of flavor, and the fish itself was perfectly cooked. My husband tried the shrimp tacos, and he seemed to enjoy them immensely, though he said that the meal itself was not very filling, and it wouldn't be long before he was hungry again. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience, with good service, great beer, and good (though over-priced) food.  It would be worth it to visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=140,3.0,3.43,3.43,2.576,3.258

I used their online ordering website and it worked pretty well, easy to navigate and understand, no weird glitches - overall pretty good. My order automates the time at which my food is supposed to be ready (4:52pm). I arrive slightly late to pick up my food (4:55pm) and park, call the number listed on the sign. The phone rings and rings for so long that I'm starting to wonder if anyone is going to answer - I am almost ready to check and see if I misdialed when a hurried sounding server answers and puts me on hold abruptly. I sit on hold for some time (maybe five minutes?), then a woman picks up on the phone and says ""I'll be here in just a minute."" and then puts me back on hold for a few more. When she comes back she informs me that my order is not yet ready (now about ten minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready) but I'm willing to be unbothered by it, clearly they're extremely busy and we're all only human so whatev. I wait until the server brings the food out, she lists each item in the bag as she hands it to me saying ""the two entrees in this bag, one steak one burger"" and the appetizer and other miscellaneous things in the other. I take the bags, pay, leave. Arrive home and discover that the salad that comes with the $20 NY Strip Smothered in Bleu cheese & mushroom sauce is nowhere to be found. Then I discover that my ""smothered"" NY Strip is not smothered in anything at all and is sitting dry on top of my mashed potatoes. Frankly; $20 is a lot of money to pay for a dry unseasoned ungarnished steak with a single potato side dish. Normally I'd be willing to let something like this go because toppings are normally something I as a customer would add - but this dish was ADVERTISED as having the topping. It is pretty questionable that the cooks in the kitchen don't know how to prepare their own dishes.  Beyond that the experience was fine, food tasted alright (the food that I actually got anyway) - my husband had a burger with jalapenos on it and wedge fries that he really liked and my steak was alright and my potatoes were also okay. The stuffed mushroom appetizer we got as above average.  Not too sorry to say that we won't be coming back to this place.

Server stopped to confirm whether I wanted the pot roast sandwich or the pot roast dinner. Confirming I wanted the dinner, she left.  Eventually the salad arrived with tomatoes. Salad was good. Then dinner arrived... it was the pot roast sandwich! The server did stop by & noticed that it wasn't the dinner... she offered to take the sandwich & replace it with the dinner, I said no (because I was now hungry). The bill arrived, I figured that she would have adjusted it to the pot roast sandwich, but she still charged me for the dinner, so took out up to the front counter to be adjusted. Never did get the diet Pepsi, but wasn't charged for it either.

Semi homemade .  We had the 'new' deep dish fries which were - eh okay. The fries were very thin ( think shoestring potatoes) so they didn't hold much of the topping, which was beef and chilies . Also ordered calamari . Not the best but definitely not the worst .  We all had cocktails or beer. They really charge you for drinks . I do recommend the pear cider. I'm not a beer drinker and it was good , crisp, refreshing . I also enjoyed a house cocktail that's was good but not 9.50 good .  I ordered a BBQ chicken salad. For the price it was a lot of food , but the flavor a and textures weren't anything to write home about. My lettuce seemed limp, the vegetables were also old and the dressing was missing something . My husband had a deep dish pizza which was mostly just dough and not much in the topping department . When you think of a deep dish you think of almost a pie , stuffed high with all those toppings, cheese and sauce .... Not this ... Think lots of dough pressed into a deep dish pan and then lightly sauced and topped. The only "" deep dish"" was the physical dish itself. We have lived in Chicago ,so maybe we know good deep dish but I wouldn't recommend it .  Think they were skimping to save money. Another time I ordered the ahi salad and it was Very delicious . If you like ahi I would recommend that .  For dessert we heard pozukkis were a must and did the trio. They were delicious . Warm, soft cookies topped with ice cream .  Our waiter was great but it did take forever to get seated. We could see our table , empty and not cleaned for at least 15 min when we were told less then a 15 min wait . We ended up waiting 35 min .

My friend and I just got our bonuses, so we had a ""Treat yo' self Day"". We started with mimosas followed by other drinks and our appetizer of avocado egg rolls which were also amazing. The egg rolls had excellent flavor and the dipping sauce that was thick and dark was also a nice accompaniment. I don't really know what the sauce was though. Who'd a thunk though, avocado and egg roll together just perfect.  Then the main entrees came shortly after small conversations with our server. It was really a personalized experience even though she had several other tables that she was handling and also one of the big bosses was in town and had a whole table to himself just looking down on the parade of servers and hosts and patrons waltzing below.  My friend got fish tacos which basically she devoured in about 5 minutes because yet again they were amazing. I got a deep dish 9"" pizza with onions and olives. Yusssss gawd! Just perfect. I know I sound like a broken record but it was just almost too good to be true.

The meat was super thin and DRY. It was well, well done and had very little seasoning. It also feel apart and crumbled when I opened it up and touched it. There was no sauce whatsoever on the burger. Which doesn't even make sense because it comes with it and is clearly written in the description and lastly there were no onion straws even though it was printed on the box they packed my burger in. I'm so surprised at this carelessness and it just seems like whoever cooked this hates his or her job and is taking it out on the people. I ate about 5 bites total, not even half of it.

But please understand that sometimes a woman doesn't want to wear makeup, spray tan, do her hair and weighs 18lbs more as the my license indicates (thank you senior year, but I've been slowly losing and am going to grad school!!).

We used the bathroom again a little while later and still dirty and no soap. I was contacted by the manager and asked to email him.

70,Jasmine G.,"Seattle, WA",198,43,20.0,1.0,2015-10-11,"This was my third visit to the Tacoma BJs. My previous visits were awesome - food and service and was great! This time I was in a hurry so called in my order to go. This is where things went very, very badly. I asked for a personal sized cheese pizza worth bacon. She repeated my order back to me as a pizza with pepperoni. As someone who hates pepperoni I was dumbfounded and repeated back to her ""no pepperoni, just bacon."" She said okay, my total and that it would be 15-20 minutes. I arrived and went straight to the takeout counter where I stood for a solid 8-10 minutes as several waiters and waitresses went in and out. I could see my order sitting there getting cold so I went to the hostess to let her know I was waiting. She said ""okay"" and walked to the back and reappeared a few minutes later not acknowledging me or my food. About two minutes later a man appeared to give me my food and take care of the bill. He opened the box and the pizza had - you guessed it - pepperoni on top. I told him I had asked for bacon and the ordering story. I was in a hurry so I took the pizza as is. The guy said there was still bacon on top though. As I paid I opened the box again and didn't see any visible bacon and I asked the guy AGAIN if there was bacon on top - he assured me there was.  Fast forward to me eating the food, cold by then, and sure enough there wasn't any bacon on the thing at all and barely any pizza sauce. I checked the label on the box and all it said was pepperoni and the receipt only said pepperoni as well. The guy lied to my face about it because he also saw the label and receipt.  The food at BJs is awesome and the vibe is great, but I would highly recommend taking in the experience at a nearby location (Tukwila, etc) for better service where they don't lie to your face about their errors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=60,2.84,2.88,2.88,2.052,2.864
106,Anny T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,2.0,2015-10-21,"I come to this BJ's whenever I hit the Tacoma Mall for a little shopping. It's convenient because it's right outside of the mall. Anyways, all the times I have been to this BJ's I've had bad customer service. I've experienced so much better customer service at their other locations in WA. A few times coming here I've had bad service. Servers and hostesses that just have bad attitudes!!! I understand the restaurant business can be stressful, just like any other job (yes, I've worked at restaurants before, as a host, server then management), but when you're stress.. seriously don't let your customers know! Don't complain about having to serve a 6-top table, etc. Learn to do your job right, manage your time & routine, etc then you wouldn't be complaining so much and go w/ the flow. Recently, I went to have lunch w/ 2 of my friends. It was a little pass 11:00 AM (around the time they opened). There were two 2-top tables seated at the bar, 1 2-top table & a 4-top booth occupied where we were being sat. Not busy at all right??!  We were going to get seated at a table (between the 2-top & 4-top booth), however 1 of my friends had asked if we could be seated at a booth instead due to her having her 2 month old baby with her whom she was carrying. The host took a good 5 minutes to decide if it was okay for us to even move to the booth that was right next to the table we were going to be seated at & next to the 4-top booth that was already seated. Like it was even a struggle to literally move us a seat over??? 1. Didn't like the tone of her voice when she was taking our name down(as if we were going to be on a waiting list; never had anyone ask to have our names down when they weren't busy) & questioning my friend whether she even had a carseat for the child 2. Didn't like the fact she made it seem like a damn difficult situation to move us to the booth next to the table she was seated at. When she sat us to the booth, she was frustrated & said they only had 1 server on the floor. That's funny, because the the bar had a bartender, then there was a server serving the two 2-top booths up there. The 2-top booth across from us had their own server and the 4-top booth next to us had the same server as we did. My friends & I were sure she was speaking about us to the staff members surrounding the hostess stand because literally all of them turned around & looked right at our table, while her mouth was the only one moving. If she was, which yes we're assuming she was.. really? try not to make it so obvious & if you want it to be obvious, you mind as well say it to our faces?? Another thing that irritated us, but we weren't really sure if our server was being serious was, She came to take our order & we told her we weren't ready because we literally sat down. The thing that comes out of her mouth was ""Good, I'm very busy right now"". WTF?!! you're busy when there's only 5 tables in the whole restaurant seated, which you're not even serving all of them??! All my friends & I wondered was if these people are busy now when there's not even 10 tables seated at the whole restaurant, how are they when dinner hits?! More people were on the floor, which we saw a few staff members just standing around waiting to serve people. Like I said before, I've worked in the restaurant business before. If the hostess had a problem with us asking to sit at a booth (which, hello I know there's plenty of people that do that & it messes up your section of seating for servers) but why not just let the server who was suppose to get the next table know that you'll give them the next 2 tables to make up for it or something? Explain to them what happened. At least that's what I always did for a server. I really wish the employees at BJ's wore name tags just so I could pin out who were the ones making the company look bad VS putting fingers to everyone as a whole because problem workers should get the ding for their actions, not those who work hard & do their job right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=120,2.76,2.85,2.85,2.216,2.814

Due to me now eating alone my party ordered another beverage to hold them over while I eat my dinner.

The wait time, which the hostess said was a couple of minutes, was actually closer to 25 minutes, and an entire section of the restaurant (where we wound up eventually being seated), was open. The food was all underseasoned and overly greasy. The server took the time to specifically ask me if medium-well was acceptable for the cook on my burger, to which I said yes, but apparently medium-well means ""cook it to within an inch of its life, and make sure it's extra dry and crumbly.""

I don't think the lettuce had been dried properly. The ""herb-grilled chicken breast"" was way over-salted, and there was a tiny little pile of chopped bacon and a tiny pile of crumbled blue cheese sitting on the edge of the bowl.

She returned to our table a few minutes later to explain that the card had been denied. We explained again that the card number would need to be entered manually. She said that she couldn't do that but would ask her manager. The manager returned a few minutes later to tell us the card had been declined. We asked if she had entered it manually or had swiped it. She got defensive and said she had swiped it and that should be sufficient. We tried to explain again that the credit card company knew about the problem and was sending us another card, but in the meantime, entering this card manually would work. And it had worked just fine in the 3 days leading up to this meal. The manager then back-peddled and said she had punched the card in and that we now needed to pay for our meal by other means.

Hostess assumed we would be okay with a table. Once we got to the table we asked for a booth(sitting at a dinner table with booths around you is like putting you on display). The hostess goes on to say the booth(one out of many open) was not clean and that a busser would need to wipe it off. In my opinion the hostess could have been more forward thinking and could have walked a few steps and grab a rag considering the busser could have been busy. But I guess that was not her job so she didn't have to do it despite the fact I've seen many hostess wipe a table. We ended up sitting at the table. We are then greeted by the waitress who takes our drink order. I give her my ID and embarrassed me in front of my coworkers.

There are so many options and I've loved everyone I've had. Service is always great, in the bar or the restaurant.

6,Tiffani A.,"Tacoma, WA",12,112,99.0,5.0,2017-11-26,"Had dinner with my friend here last night! Our server Monique was very delightful. Bj's has a great variety of food... We started with house ceasar salad, shared pita nachos (new fav) as an appetizer, then my friend got a salmon with cherry glaze that was divine. I forgot the name of the salmon dish. Also from previous dining experiences, I also recommend their avacado egg rolls & spinach artichoke dip. Their flatbreads are also good here. Everyone is very friendly & helpful. Our appetizer came after the salmon entree & the manager came over to apologize which wasn't necessary but very nice & shows that they truly care about their customers. I definitely recommend this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.56,2.97,2.944,,3.2060000000000004
23,Linda W.,"Spanaway, WA",0,1,,2.0,2017-11-26,Been going to BJ for lunch have not been there in a while.  Ordered the shrimp scampi.  Poor Very expensive for what it was  no bread no salad  $19.95  pasta was tough not totally cooked.  Husband ordered the BJ hamburger.  The meat was burned around the edges along with the bun.  He tried to scrap off the burned part on the bun and only ended up eating the center part of the meat by itself. Will not be going back  for $36.00 total bill will go somewhere else,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma?start=20,3.6,2.94,2.948,,3.204

Calamari is all tentacles. Beer is mediocre and overpriced. Environment is meh. Side order of fries is tiny and expensive.

5,Dan B.,"Warren, MI",2,72,1.0,5.0,2017-12-12,"So, I'm here for work for a couple of days. We went to this mall and unsuccessfully tried one restaurant. Tonight, we tried BJs.  And we were all happy.  The service could not have been better. Caitlyn (spelling?) Was amazing and friendly.  I had the ribs. They weren't bad. I was full, and the taste was quote pleasing.  The tortilla soup was great, as well.  If you come to Tacoma Mall, come here to eat. The restaurant was nice and the food and service were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.6,2.94,2.948,,3.204
0,Chuck M.,"Silverdale, WA",2922,434,5224.0,4.0,2017-12-17,"BJ's Brewhouse appears to me to be one of those chain restaurants that really knows what the consumer wants when out dining. This restaurant really is one of the wife's favorite places to go...only because it is located so far away from our home do I not appreciate coming here. With that said...service is almost always prompt, and always cheerful. I do like eating here very much. I have tried many of the menu items...lately I've enjoyed the parmigiana crusted chicken, served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Routinely this dish comes with a lemon style gravy...the gravy is good, but I always ask to have the regular chicken gravy instead. Our food arrived promptly. I had the chicken tortilla soup as a starter. It arrived first, steaming hot and very yummy. This is a really tasty soup. Following was our entree...the wife really enjoyed her fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes and vegetables. She doesn't deviate from what she wants, this is it or she goes elsewhere. Me on the other hand, I try all kinds of foods...tonight I ordered the parmigiana crusted chicken, it was a large dish, excellent chicken...perfectly steamed broccoli, and very good mashed potatoes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.64,2.96,2.948,,3.232
3,Terry S.,"Raleigh, NC",91,19,2.0,3.0,2017-12-28,Called ahead for seating. Didn't matter - was still told 25-30 minutes upon arriving on a Thursday night at 8pm. Seated in about 10. Host staff was cold at best. BJ's Bloody Mary was good. Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa bowl was great except for the obvious lack of quinoa in the bowl. Should be renamed Shrimp rice bowl with Peruvian quinoa. Server (i believe his name was Ponce) was awesome and full of personality. Keep him around. Three Stars. Pluses were the taste of the food and the server. Minuses were the host staff and lack of quinoa in the quinoa bowl.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.56,2.94,2.944,,3.188
2,Amie A.,"Federal Way, WA",29,5,4.0,2.0,2018-01-01,"*sigh* another less than stellar experience.   I was willing to completely overlook the fact that the chili queso dip we ordered came without the chili.  Mistakes happen, so I moved on.  Then our entrees arrived and it was very clear that my sweet potato fries ( that I was charged  extra for because they are a premium side) had sat for quite a while and were barely warm.  My husbands regular fries, however, were hot and amazing.  My chicken sandwich had barely any honey mustard, but that was easily fixed.... although for a $15 sandwich i hopes for a little more care and attention to detail.  Still, not too big of a deal.    Here's what offended me, ruined the experience,  earned 2 stars and put BJ's on the list of places I'm not going to spend my money at......  I was maybe a quarter of the way through my meal when the server, who had been extremely inattentive the entire visit popped back up and asked us if we wanted dessert.  I typically finish my entree before thinking about that, so I found that a little odd.  When we declined, instead of making us feel comfortable to finish our meal, the server hands us the check.  With almost my entire meal untouched and each of us with a full beer.  We had every intention of ordering another drink, relaxing and enjoying our dinner.  Instead, we felt rushed and so finished quickly so as not to inconvenience them any further .  It's sad that In a restaurant that wasn't even half full they pressure their customers to get out as quickly as possible rather than taking great care of them.   Lesson learned, and I'll spend my money at businesses that value their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.52,2.95,2.936,,3.178
1,Glen B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,1.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"Terrible, service, host, waitress, manager. Rib eye steaks are better at the dollar store, much smaller but at least edible. Tryed to order beer, waitress had no clue, hard drink, a slow screw, not any clue, and of course a huge bar this size would be able to stock slow gin and orange juice, Not!. Ok what about amereto and coke, no just Pepsi, let try that. Just guess , ... , Ok now how about extra ranch on the side for the $15.00 salad. Sure 2oz. And none on the salad, so the word extra must mean something different to this place than extra. We tried to make the best of it, until getting the evil eye from the manager, for overstaying our allowed time slice, even though the 14 empty tables on our section and total lack of patrons, of course there might have been a party looking for waterfront seating, and our table had that puddle of water from the leaky ceiling right next to us. Oh yeah and the smiling staff, NOT. NOT ONE SINGLE SMILE PERIOD. Even the nice ""thanks for coming, come back to see us soon.""   ...not...hostess was way to busy for that, there were going to be customers come in so she had all attention on that possibility alone. Would we recommend this place to anyone, sure our worst enemies, forwarding a different message to them next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tacoma,3.48,2.92,2.924,,3.144
