BJ's is BJ's, wherever you go, some are better some are worst, but you know what to expect.  I have spent the last 4 weeks in Tallahassee, pretty much eating out every night. First I was very excited to try out what this town has to offer. Visited some of the highly rated restaurants on yelp. Maybe I had high expectations, but I left disappointed every time. I am sorry people of Tallahassee, but good old BJ's serve pretty good food comparing to many of the ""high end places"".  I suggest you try the Pork Chop, the Moroccan spiced salmon, the mahi mahi or the ahi salad. You won't be disappointed. Yes, the wait is long and service sucks most of the time, but if you sit at the bar you can cut the wait and get the bartender's attention whenever you need it.

The second time we went for lunch.  It was busy but we got in and pretty soon wished we hadn't.  The service was abysmal.  Every ten minutes or so someone would try to bring us some other table's order till eventually we got ours.  As this was happening our server was so busy grab-assing with her colleagues that she couldn't be bothered to re-fill our drinks even once.  That's inexcusable when you're charging $3 for a club soda. It took us about 15 minutes to get our waitress over and ask for the check.  Between our table and the service station she decided to chit-chat for awhile and check in on another table, then came back to us and realized she had forgotten to get our check.  She eventually brought it to us, and when we were reviewing it we noticed they charged us for a few things that we never ordered and never received.  It took another 15-20 minutes to get her back to the table.  She left to correct it, and came back about 15 minutes later (after much additional multitasking) to say that she needed to have the credit card again!  We finally told her to take the card, walk directly to the register, correct the f-ing ticket, and walk directly back.  If you're not doing the math, we were stuck there almost an additional hour after we were finished with our meal.  Needless to say, no math needed to calculate her tip.

I tried their amber Ale and didn't bother to finish it. They are also among  the most expensive in town for bottled beer. It was $6+ for Dos Equis, Heineken, Blue Moon, etc. The food was overpriced as well. My meal tasted like it came from frozen, prepackaged foods. My boyfriend had the brewhouse burger and said it tasted like ""the best steak and shake burger he'd ever had"" Only it was 3 times the price. The service was decent but I noticed that 3 tables around us had gotten up since we were seated and they stayed empty for over 10 minutes until after we left, even though there was still tons of people waiting outside to get a table.

I prefer the appetizer selections of shareables and small plates. Tasty, filling, and perfect for socializing. Tables can accommodate large groups which makes it a good spot to celebrate special events. In an effort to push/sell their own beers, wait staff are only educated on the brewhouse beers. You are left to learn on your own the large Belgium bottled beers.  Staff work in teams so it rather easy to get someone to help you get that extra napkins your server forgot to bring.

96,Fat G.,"Tallahassee, FL",8,75,,1.0,2014-01-21,"WOW! Having eaten a few times at BJ's in Gainesville, we watched with growing anticipation as the BJ's in Tally was abuilding.  Finally it opened, but we decided to let the store get its legs under it and iron out those ever present opening glitches. So last weekend off we went. We'd always had pizza and been okay with that, so we decided we needed to spread our wings and try something different. And before I get mail, I realize a burger and a chix sandwich aren't THAT different, I only meant for our BJ's visit. My partner opted for the """"NEW"" Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich; I opted for the Crispy Jalapeno Burger. That Parm crusted chicken arrived showily 'chef-sliced', that heavily angled cut apparently for drama. What me partner ended up with was a clearly cooked from frozen chix patty all on one half of the bread. Yes, one-half was completely devoid of the proffered protein. Small portion of chicken? Too much bread? I don;t care - but the bread and chicken ratio was way off. But that left one-half with chicken. How was that? Well, the way it was prepped and cut left the ingredients to fall out. Hmmm...too much mayo lube or the creamy garlic sauce? Well, that left it a knife and fork sandwich, and a pretty poor one at that.  But there's that Crispy Jalapeno Burger. Sounds absolutely wonderfully tasty to me. Presented with a small portion of friend jalapenos, pepper Jack, Chipotle mayo, ""Baja"" sauce, LTO, and cilantro. First bite - excellent char on the burger. Tasted great! But then there was something...chewy. Examine please. Well, how does one fry a jalapeno to the consistency of a tire plug? I went home and tried it without success. The jalapenos were certainly not crispy. Both sandwiches were ordered with 'crispy thin fried'. Thin? Check. Crispy? Not a one that either of us found. And very nearly not done. Service was okay, but nothing to write home about. Bottom line - not on the return to list, at least for a long time.

The restaurant is beautifully and tastefully decorated with quality pieces and a high-end finish. I was particularly impressed by the bathroom's appearance and cleanliness. It's the sort of place you could bring business clients, a date, or a family with a couple small children, and everyone would be happy.  Our waiter was very nice and polite. With kids in the group (2 kids under the age of 2), you quickly notice how long it takes for food to arrive, and everything came out very promptly.  Last but not least... The food! My side Caesar salad was simple but tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my deep dish Great White pizza. It essentially tasted like doughy breadsticks had a baby with chicken fettuccine alfredo. I ordered the small and was full after eating 3 of the 6 slices. I shared a slice or two with the rest of the table, and everyone thought it was really good, too.

I think the restaurant had a rough opening and reaped several bad reviews because of it. I think since then they have settled down and are now putting out good food and good service.  I had a burger which was very good. There wasn't a whole lot to say about it but it was good. My wife had some  kind of deep dish pizza which was also very good. They seem to specialize in pizza so that's probably a safe bet if you want to ensure that you get something good. Being a brew pub they have their own brews which were decent. A few of the special selections were a little better than the typical offerings but over all pretty good.  The one thing that really bothered me about this place was the menu. It was huge. It's about the size of the cheese cake factory's menu, which is way too big in my opinion. Cheese Cake Factory doesn't, in my opinion, deliver on all their menu items and I can't imagine this place does either. I know this place is a chain and they need to stay consistent, but you can't possible do, pizza, burgers, fish, pasta, BBQ and do them all well.  Overall I like this place.

85,Jennifer I.,"Tallahassee, FL",107,648,62.0,2.0,2014-06-01,"First, let me start off by saying that I would give the service at this restaurant 5 stars. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and very patient with our table (we had some people who needed extra time to decide on a dish). Also, the restaurant manager came by and asked us about the quality of our meal and offered to fix anything that wasn't good.  The food, however, is another story. We all ordered the house sirloin steak, with various side dishes. The side dishes were fine (mashed potatoes were good, the baked potato was....well, a baked potato, it's hard to screw that up, and the vegetables were good). The steaks, on the other hand, were not well cooked. I ordered my steak medium-rare, and it came out well-done. My friend ordered hers medium, and it came out as a hockey puck. When the manager offered to replace her hockey puck with a properly cooked steak, the steak that was brought out was rare.

However, it did take an hour+ to get food for a mostly empty place. Asked the waiter to lower the shades and after he did so, he took the orders of tables that came after us, and we had to get up and flag him down to take our order finally (20+ minutes to lower the blinds and return to take our order??). Food came without silverware, which took asking two separate waiters to get. For dessert, we had the triple ghirardelli pizookie, which was great, aside a very iron-y metal taste, which was either the silverware or tin it was served in, and it did not complement the chocolate well.

There was so much on there that I kept going back and forth on entrees, so they have a little something for everyone. I finally settled on the cream soda, calamari for an appetizer and lightly fried mahi mahi tacos for my entree. The cream soda was very tasty! The calamari was absolutely delicious! I've always had rubbery, hard to chew calamari but this absolutely melted in my mouth. The mahi mahi tacos were just as  yummy.  My son had the root beer float, which he loved so much that he decided to get another one and he didn't leave a drop in either cup! His appetizer was the mozzarella sticks and his entree was the root beer glazed wings. Yes, he was in a root beer mood today:-)  He loved all his food and even had enough leftovers to bring home.

The lady who brought our food pretty much dumped it down in front of us then disappeared, My husband had the deep dish pizza, he loved it. I on the other hand, had the fish and chips. My food was room temperate and the homemade tarter sauce was HORRIBLE. I've never tasted anything like it, I believe it was either old or was not kept at the appropriate temperature. I only took a few bites and I was done. Upon leaving the restaurant I became very very ill, and could barely make it to the Publix down street. I experienced this for most of the evening, losing all of the two bites I took of my dinner. I know that my dinner caused it because I had only eaten a salad and grapes the entire day before dining at BJs and I was fine all day prior to this. I believe one of the biggest issues is the size of the menu, it is too big. There is no way they are consistently keeping everything hot, cold, or fresh with a menu that size.

I would have preferred more broccoli, but it was a nice appetizer course.  I tried the half triple decker with wedge fries and my companion had a grilled ham and cheese with wedge fries. These coated and tasty potatoes are like tiny tater logs that we love to get at chicken shacks. Sandwich meats were excellent quality and piled high. The only thing I could think to add to my sandwich might be an option to add bacon; everything needs bacon. We left with happy, full bellies AND leftovers and change in our pockets. Excellent value!

It doesn't get better than a frosty mug of seriously good root beer.  BJ's is made with real sugar.  In addition to the root beer, they also have vanilla cream soda, orange cram soda and black cherry soda on draft.  AND they'll make any of them into a float upon request.  Giving into temptation occasionally can be a good thing, right? We shared the Root Beer Glazed Ribs to start.  They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was tasty.  They were gone in the blink of an eye.  Oh so tender meat and savory sauce.  Yes, please! BJ's Brewhouse Classic Tavern Cut Pizza is just the way we like it.  Thin crispy crust with flavorful tasty sauce.  It's topped with pepperoni, fresh mushroom and Italian sausage and BJ's 5 cheese blend.  Hot, fresh, crispy, cheesey goodness.  It ticked all our pizza-lovin' boxes.  WINNER The Pizookies will keep us coming back.  Time and time again.  We shared the Pizookie Trio this time:  Chocolate Chunk, Triple Chocolate with Ghiradelli and Peanut Butter.  Om nom nom nom.  I can't imagine ending a meal here without a Pizookie and I wouldn't question anyone starting a meal that way either.

I can say that for a chain, it is a little more of quality than others, so I will come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tallahassee?start=20,3.36,3.29,3.29,,3.318

3,William L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1531,321,1478.0,4.0,2017-10-14,"Conveniently located across from Governor's Square Mall, I had the opportunity to dine with friends one evening on a recent visit to Tallahassee.    Arriving right as Happy Hour was ending - 6:56 p.m. - Damien H was our server.  My two friends and I were quickly seated in the bar area.  2  ""Happy Hour"" Bacardi and Coke's for me, and a white peach Margarita for each of my friends.  Dinner was quickly ordered - 10 piece bone-in chicken wings and a large gourmet five neat pizza.   Pizza was great - and only cost $12.98 with the 50 percent off Happy Hour special.  Chicken wings were average in taste and were priced 50 percent off at $5.63.  Margarita's were a dollar off at $8.50 each and the Bacardi and Coke's were $4.00 each for Happy Hour.  I'm a cheap date.   Damien was a friendly and polite server, although busy.  From my vantage point, he seemed overworked, but he did make it back to our table several times during our visit.  Restaurant was busy, but seemingly well run.  The hostess quickly seated all guests immediately upon arrival.  Plenty of parking and central location on Apalachee Parkway, near downtown Tallahassee.  Restrooms were clean and well stocked.   I would stop at this particular BJ's Restaurant on a future visit to Tallahassee, but most certainly during Happy Hour for the great specials.

I have visited this location twice and its taken an hour to get food. The food was pretty good but the service is horrible. Both times the waitress have been missing in action.

Server arrives and tells her name and how to correctly pronounce it. Weird just weird! They only serve Pepsi products but server neglects to tell us they hand craft sodas too. Order appetizers it very disappointing. Bussel sprouts were burnt. The avocado egg rolls were entirely too mushy. These looked great in photos. We ordered our entrees later to avoid a food pile up. Guess what? Not 2 minutes after our appetizers comes our entrees. The expediter asks to take away our appetizers. I tell our server, using the correct pronunciation, and she states ""we are getting ready for the rush so we are hurrying food out"". Daughter's Smoked Turkey Dip was very good. My Pulled Pork Sandwich was just okay. Portion was large but if it isn't good who cares.

2,Dottie T.,"Tallahassee, FL",29,48,116.0,3.0,2017-12-09,We had a very nice lunch here. We wanted to go to brunch at a nearby café but there was no way we were waiting in the line that was there. So we decided to go to BJ's. The main thing I wanted from brunch was the Mimosa which I was easily able to get there. The food was very good however the appetizer came out with the main meal and that was highly disappointing. The appetizer we ordered was the flat bread nachos and I'll have to say it's probably the best flat bread I've ever had. Extremely delicious. I will most definitely be getting that the next time I go there. I also got a Nashville spicy chicken sandwich I believe it was called and it was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. I was worried because I've had something with the same name other places and it was awful. I got a Caesar side salad with it which was definitely overdressed and wilted. Don't order that. Brad got their new chicken sandwich that has the ham and cheese I believe and he loved it. I didn't try it so I can't comment. I can tell you I will most definitely be going there again and I would've given four stars if the appetizer had come out first and the salad hadn't been wilted.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tallahassee,3.48,3.28,3.28,,3.3600000000000003

Our mixed drinks were mixed perfectly. Overall the atmosphere was perfect for a family night out.

1,Brandi C.,"Tallahassee, FL",187,100,651.0,4.0,2017-12-14,"FOOD/DRINKS: I love the menu at BJ's because there is variety and I am pretty certain there is something for everyone. I love the variety of beer and I would have to say that the pizza is at the top of the list as far as favorites. The pizza is also 1/2 off on Monday's. There is a late night menu as well as happy hour specials. The bar area is pretty spacious; yet cozy and it would be a good place to watch a sporting event.   SERVICE: The service has been pretty good on most visits. I did have bad experience one night with a large party but that doesn't outweigh the positive service that I have received. On my last visit, our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. He answered all of our questions without hesitation and gave recommendations when we asked. He frequently checked on us and when the kitchen made my order wrong, he immediately took it back and apologized.   ATMOSPHERE: ""Upscale casual"". This restaurant is a nice size and has a bit of an intimate feel. Ok for groups.  LOCATION: Ample parking. Parking lot PROs- Food variety, happy hour specials and late night menu.

0,Marcy H.,"Tallahassee, FL",208,105,253.0,4.0,2018-01-10,"BJ's satisfies my embarrassing love of all things cozy and comforting in a way that other big chains never could.  As many others have mentioned it's a much better (albeit slightly pricier) alternative to other chains like Applebee's and Chili's. They brew a lot of their own beers and many of them are actually really good!  I came on a Saturday night at 7pm and they were completely slammed. We put our name down and went to Target to kill the 35 minutes the Maitre D' told us we'd have to wait. When we came back she sat us immediately. The place is huge which I feel like makes it difficult to manage effectively but they seem to do a pretty good job.  The menu is extensive, and I feel like I'm a prime victim of chronic indecisiveness; however the menu is very well organized and has a lot of very different items which makes it much easier to choose. I love that they have everything from super healthy to sinful gluttony and everything in between. Their kids menu is also awesome and allows you to pick various items for their meal.  The service was great (although a bit slow I imagine because the place is so huge and busy) and the food was scrumptious. My husband loved his burger, and I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with shrimp. That salad was a shocking flavor bomb and did not make me regret not ordering the fish and chips that my pregnancy cravings tried to hijack my brain to order. It was dusted with the blackening seasoning they use for the shrimp which was delicious and it was chock full of shrimpies, crispy tortilla strips, corn, beans and cheese. The dressing was delicious too (I asked for it on the side because I'm healthy like that).   My husband and I both really enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try the other 5 million menu items!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tallahassee,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
