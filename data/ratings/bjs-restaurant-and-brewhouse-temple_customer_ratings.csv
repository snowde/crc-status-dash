156,Megan R.,"Georgetown, TX",1,6,,5.0,2012-01-19,"I went here on my lunch break today.  Usually I don't venture into actual restaurants for lunch but it was payday, and hey, I wanted to treat myself.  And I was treated well.  Let's get down to business: Atmosphere: Very busy, very spacious restaurant.  That said, the only time I had to wait for anything was when I was being sat, which wasn't long.  I like the bar atmosphere quite a bit.  They have tons of tvs and an extensive beer list along with cocktails.  I sat in the dining room this time though. Service: Excellent! My server, Megan, was far and away the best I've had in some time, she sold me on a bunch of great items and knew the menu well.  She was prompt, polite, and courteous.  Very good.  I had a couple managers stop by briefly to ask how I liked everything as well. Food:  The lunch specials are fantastic! I walked in looking to get a sandwich and walked out having had an essentially 4 course meal for under 20 dollars.  They have new items that are ""snacks and bites"" which are pretty much mini appetizers.  I was eating alone, so these were perfect to start off.  I chose the ahi tuna, and it wasn't the paltry serving I was expecting.  It had a good 5-6 pieces of tuna and was accompanied by an asian slaw.  Usually slaws aren't my thing but I liked this one.  For my entree I went for the lunch special half sandwich and salad, specifically the Ty Cobb sandwich.  The salad was out first, and again a nice generous portion.  The sandwich also came with fries (you can choose wedges or thin and crispy. Me=wedges) which was also a nice surprise.  All of it was fresh and delectable.  The best part for me though is always the pizookie, and now they have mini personal ones!  The red velvet is to die for. Definitely check this place out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.2840000000000003,3.6400000000000006
142,Mitch W.,"Alvin, TX",0,11,,4.0,2012-03-19,"I'm in Temple a lot, and one of my wife and mine's favorite places is BJ's.  I'd say the only thing that keeps this from being 5-stars is the price.  They are expensive, but you have to know how to work it.  We have found that if you go during lunch, you get a much better value, and the portion sizes are still substantial.  We usually end up splitting the mini-pizza lunch which also includes a generous salad.  Since we both drink water, we get out of there for $10 including the tip.  I have never had a bad experience at BJ's, and it's always a place that we both look forward to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.152,3.6800000000000006

128,Naomi R.,"Flowery Branch, GA",2,3,1.0,2.0,2012-05-01,"I'll start with the actual layout. It is nicely set. My waitress was really nice; though we were done almost with our whole meal before she came by to pick up plates (at least that's what other places do). The price for the food is too much. I had 2 appetizers, a bar drink, and 3 kids menu items along with the kids cookie desert and ended up paying over 60 dollars. This is high for me when I've paid that or less and fed more people.

81,Roxy W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",155,444,1400.0,4.0,2012-06-24,"My husband and I came here for the first time today for lunch. It was a little busy around 1pm but I wasn't surprised since it's a Sunday. We ordered the root beer, sampler platter,  Thai chicken mango salad and the ahi poke. We enjoyed eating the ahi poke. The fish was fresh tasting and it is so far the only place so far I know in the area besides C & H that has ahi poke on their menu.  (The ahi poke is better here than at C & H). The price for the ahi poke appetizer is $9.95. The Thai mango chicken salad was priced at $10.95. It was  delicious and fresh tasting as well. They advertise this salad as being less than 575 calories. The ahi poke and the salad is definitely worth coming back for but not the sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer is priced at $16.95 and it came with avocado egg roll, southwestern spring roll, mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip. You could find these items at most American restaurants. I was disappointed with the avocado roll. Yelpers recommended this and I am not impressed at all. It is definitely not worth the price so I recommend NOT to get the sampler. The root beer was another recommendation by Yelpers and AGAIN I am not impressed. It was ok but it tasted like any ol' root beer.  My husband and I will definitely be back again for the ahi poke!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=80,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.2800000000000002,3.6400000000000006
125,Michael M.,"Warrenton, VA",5,105,1.0,1.0,2012-08-17,"This was my first stop on my Texas vacation.  I looked at their menu online and was excited to try the jalopeno burger.  I was seated promptly but it took 10-15 minutes before our waiter came to the table.  This was unexcuseable because it wasn't busy.  We didn't leave because I really wanted the burger.  Getting our food took around average time so no complaints there.  As for the food, everything on my burger seemed fresh but had no taste.  Nothing on it stood out.  I was expecting a kick from the fried jalopeno's but I got nothing.  That, on top of the slow service is why I give them 1 star.  PS- the waiter was friendly, just slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.0120000000000005,3.5600000000000005
123,Casey B.,"El Paso, TX",2,11,,1.0,2012-08-26,"Super disappointed. My husband and I went to a BJ's in san antonio and were in love with it, and when we found out there was one close to fort hood we were excited to go! We ordered the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, okay, kind of boring. The Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad was god awful. Rubbery mozzarella balls and tasteless tomatoes. I was hoping for smooth creamy mozzarella with yummy tomatoes like the one in San Antonio, but nope. Also, the balsamic reduction was wayyyy too thick. It stuck to the plate like glue, so I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered the Chicken Al La Fresca (the under 575 calories entree) and I was so disappointed. Chicken was flavorless, rice pilaf was so bland it tasted like plain white rice, and there was no arugula on mine, they put spinach on it instead. I didn't even eat it. My husband ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. That was the one good thing out of everything.  The manager came to talk to us and I expressed my disappointment. He asked if I wanted anything, I said no. Why would I want more gross food? I asked him to take it away. No refund, just a deal with it attitude. Will never be going here again.

151,Jim B.,"Belton, TX",1,26,,2.0,2012-11-02,As a frequent traveler  my expectations are typically set at a very reasonable level.  Having eaten at several other BJ's I was expecting above average service and food quality.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed by both at the Temple store.  I witnessed lackadaisical management and mediocre service and food.  I won't be heading back to this BJ's anytime soon.  The owners should take a hard look at their management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3360000000000003,3.5200000000000005

It is nice to rely on a clean bathroom, friendly service, a sensory overload for the kid and an easy in-and-out back to the highway.

The ""Kid's Menu"" has quite a few options and the staff interact nicely with her. We are clear upon being sat that we are there to eat and go and the staff try to accommodate, which is appreciated.

It was delicious, but I added some marinara sauce to it and it tasted even better (I just like to add marinara to everything). We also got the avocado rolls, but I didn't like them. It came with some oily sauce (soy maybe?) and the rolls were greasy. My fiance loved them though. The next time we got spinach and artichoke dip. It was great and it came with a lot of chips which is something many chains don't understand you need to eat dip with. That time we had the bbq chicken pizza. It was awesome, however the deep dish pizza isn't Chicago deep dish. I was kind of thrown off, but it's similar to pizza hut's pan pizza if that helps you understand. Their cookie desserts are AMAZING. And their cocktails are even better. Try the pomegranate sunset (or sunrise whatever its called) and the ""a drink like that.""

Wait staff seemed tense and rushed, maybe because of the large crowd? Anyways after half way through our meal the waitress chilled out a bit and was more relaxed. We started off with the potato skins covered in cheese and bacon, wasn't much cheese or bacon. I had to scrap up pieces that fell on the plate and put them on my potato wedge to make it worth eating. The flavor itself was good, I just wish they weren't so greedy with the cheese and bacon.  My fiancé ordered the texas style chicken fried steak which she enjoyed. Came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes , everything seemed fresh and tasty.  I had a small deep dish pizza with Italian sausage , bacon and pepperoni....Delicious! I finished all but two slices. My fiancé only fished a quarter of her CFS. She had a raspberry lemonade? And I had an orange twist which is a mixture of orange cream soda and some other fruity berry juices.

I got the patty melt with the wedge and thin fries (because someone else recommended those). It was good, but something I could get anywhere for cheaper than $10.  Overall, the food and service in general at this chain is good. I didn't get to try any of the beer or other drinks because I had to go back to work, but my friend definitely enjoyed his drinks.

You must go!  Lastly ask to sit in Melinda's section.  She's remarkable!  Also Steve, the manager, is extremely gracious.  The entire dining experience was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=20,2.6,3.54,3.54,,3.1640000000000006

13,Kenneth B.,"Harker Heights, TX",9,20,41.0,2.0,2017-07-08,I was not impressed by my experience at BJ's today. The service was horrendous and the food was not at all what we anticipated it to be. It took forever for the waiter to bring water to the table after requested and the refill on drinks took awhile as well. The beignet tasted more like a fried pancake than a beignet.

1,Terri K.,"Cameron, TX",0,15,1.0,2.0,2017-08-30,"I've been to several BJ's and this is one of the bottom rated. Maybe its because I come at the ""off hours"" in the afternoon. Wait staff is pretty good but the afternoon cooks seem to be off more often than not. The food is often over cooked. Today was not a good experience. Today I first ordered lemon peppered bone in wings and caeser side salad. After about 15 minutes I was told they were out of any bone in wings. So I reordered for fish and chips. After about another 20 minutes these were brought out and were more plastic than cooked fish. Way over done and lots of breading. One of the managers delivered it. After complaining and sending them back another manager said they cut off the waitress that was explaining when they saw the meal. I reordered a flat bread pizza appetizer.  They finally turned out close to right when it came out. I have been here several times in the mid afternoon and it seems the afternoon cooks need a bit more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple,2.88,3.52,3.52,,3.2640000000000002

I had eat at BJs in Waco before and ordered Pork Chops and they did not have them. Any how I asked for diet coke... nope Pepsi only. So I order a steak medium well. It arrives and cut into it and blood actually squirted from the steak like the heart was still beating. They bring another and I ask for hienz 57... don't have it... only A1. The steak was just okay. The asparagus was very tough. Mashed potatoes were good. There was no offer of any reduction in the price for all the problems.

I had their spicy chicken in soba noodles and my wife their bacon cheeseburger. My dish was very good.

The burger was below average. The kids burgers meat was half the size of the bun.
