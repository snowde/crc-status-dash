677,Aaron J.,"Redmond, WA",126,216,44.0,4.0,2012-01-07,"I guess I wouldn't be much of a Yelper if I didn't write about the time I bit into a small screw and bolt while eating a shrimp taco at BJ's. So why on God's green earth would I still give them three stars after I probably could have sued them for such a potentially dangerous mishap?  Here is my reasoning. I have eaten here maybe 20 times. Their service and food are always above average and are usually very good. I truly believe it was a freak accident that this occurred, and know that I can eat here the rest of my life and it will never happen again. They bought me my dinner and desert and were completely professional following up. I could have given them one star, but I still like BJ's, their beer, their service and their food. That's a testament to a good restaurant if a customer is willing to come back after potentially cracking a tooth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=700,3.12,3.11,3.11,2.7359999999999998,3.114

I.said I would never go to that location again ..but I did and ordered the great white pizza which is delicious and to my ""surprise"" the brought us the wrong pizza!! lol I told our waitress the order was wrong...she just took the pizza and left ..no apologies ..havent been to this location n probably will never.

The last time in particular.. we went to the bar since there was a wait for the dining room.  First mistake, we should have waited the 5-10 min. Took 10 min for someone to give us menus, etc. Got our drinks, decided on the Santa Fe Spring rolls - amazing stuff. Ordered our food - BJs fave personal pizza (during NFl games, its half off) and the spicy tomato sauce pasta with meatballs (we always order 2 things and share), and I ordered another mojito.   20 min later our food comes, no sign of our waitress and no sign of my mojito.  i cant eat pasta/pizza without peppers and cheese and I couldnt eat either one we sat there for 15 min waiting to flag someone down but no one came, our waitress was no where to be found and meanwhile my pizza was cold.  FINALLLLLLLLY she comes and says she'll bring some cheese & pepper, and my husband tells her the pizza is cold. so she throws it back in the oven. she admits she forgot all about my mojito 20 minutes after this whole fiasco i finally have my mojito and a burnt warmed up pizza. i understand no one is perfect but that would have been a good time to send over a manager, as we were pretty pissed. or at least comp. my mojito that i waited 40 min for...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=540,3.12,3.09,3.09,2.8280000000000003,3.102
672,Redondo B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,40,,1.0,2012-01-11,Went in on the morning of New Years day which was on a Sunday to watch the NFL football games. Very light crowd and a small group of people watching and my game wasn't on. I asked the bartender about the game I was looking for and he said my team is out of the playoff hunt and they aren't showing those games. Something like 14 televisions in the place with several not being watched and they couldn't put my game on one of them so I left... Went next door to Lazy Dog Cafe and what a different experience. Bartender saw me looking at the screens and asked me what game I was looking for. He went out of his way to find a television that he could put it on for me.  And they introduced themselves to me by name and personally took responsibility for me having a good experience which I did. I know my opinion is minor because BJ's usually gets crowded and apparently they know this because the service always sucks and the temperature there is always freezing. Forget BJ's and head on over to Lazy Dog and you will have a much better time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=700,3.04,3.08,3.08,2.436,3.0640000000000005

I enjoy deep dish pizza, if you don't, this is not for you. The service gets no stars. Over half the times I've been here they get something wrong.  One time they got my pizza wrong 3 times. Simple order; Medium pizza with meatballs, no tomatoes. First the bring out a pizza with peppers. Then they bring out a pizza with only pepperoni. Next they bring out a pizza with meatballs and tomatoes. 3 wrong order out of 3. By that time i was starving and just picked the tomatoes off and ate it. The manager came over and gave us free soup and a free pizookie for dessert. It was a nice gesture and appreciated but the service is always bad and the orders are always wrong. It can also get to be a very long wait for a table. I suggest calling ahead. They do not take reservations but they will put your name in on a call in.

I of course chose to grab a beer at BJ's.  The place beats the heck out of the depressing lounge area of the auto center and they have a good selection of craft beers. They had a belgian that I wasn't familiar with ""Maredsous 8"" Really good stuff.  The food on the other hand was pretty blah. I had the angus sliders. Pretty f-ink bland. The fries we're nice but the little burgers could have used some help. Meh, thats why I normally don't do the chains for food.  So in summation my little wet nosed puppies.

They got our bill wrong the first time around and we had to wait 10+ minutes to get it back even when we told them we were in a rush.

844,John P.,"Carson, CA",4,8,3.0,1.0,2012-02-08,"So far the worst BJ I've ever been to and I've been to the ones in OC. The service staff obviously could not count as well as the servers because they seated us(6 people) in such a small space and table that we had to complain and be moved into the patio. Untensils that was given to us was only for four and not six so we had to ask for that not to mention plates too they only had four, c'mon simple common sense... And then there's the drinks, our server is so confident he'll remember our order that he doesn't even write anything down. We asked for ice teas some water with lemon wedges and all we got was sprite and plain water without lemons. My mom was also treated offensively, we were ordering our appetizers and my mom wanted the lettuce wrap and the server said that it was her main meal. I mean seriously? Don't you know the definition of appetizers? So the best part was when all of our order came in and they have no room to put it in because they put us in a pretty shitty table seating and space and that is why they had to move us when we complained the best part was when the server asked us if we want help to move our food, lol seriously these people are so idiotic and offensive. Talked to the manager and we let them know how shitty their service was and are a disgrace to the restaurants franchise name.

I asked the person at the front where we were in line, and she just kept making excuses, and said there's only a few parties ahead.

492,Nicole B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,94,,2.0,2012-04-20,"I was holding off on reviewing this place simply because my coworkers and I frequent this place (at least 1-2x's per week) since we work so close and their lunch specials are cheap with a good amount of food, and I didn't want to give them a bad review. But after our experience today, I decided it's time for a review. First, their service has been horrible (at least to us). The servers that we have been getting, particularly this tall white guy with dark hair, have been unpleasant. He comes, takes our order, and disappears. We don't even get refills. We don't see him at all after he takes our order. He only comes 10 minutes after we're done with our food to give us the check. Also, we have had other unpleasant servers, who we literally have to track down in order to have her/him bring us a side of ranch or a refill. Second, the quality of their food over the last 3-5 months have sucked. We have sent back so many dishes. The meat is either undercooked, there is too much dressing in the salad, the fries are too oily and cold, etc. It makes me wonder if they have all new chefs? Third, the past three times that we have ordered appetizers (including today), our appetizers would come out at the same time as our food. Are you kidding me? We always send them back and tell them to take it off the bill. What's the point of an appetizer if we're gonna eat it with our main course? Fourth, the utensils are dirrrty!! They have food crusts all over them, and deep water stains. I wonder if they got a new dish washer. Fifth, we always order a pazooki. This time the cookie was literally attached to the pan. We could not scoop it up no matter how hard we tried. It tasted like crap. I am so surprised, because all it is is  a cookie and ice cream, so how can they mess it up?  Sixth, their service has been soooooooo slow. We order our food right away because we only have a 1.5 hours for our lunch break, but then it takes them a good 30-35 minutes to bring out our food. I wonder why they used to be quick with brining out our food in the past but now it takes them forever. Overall, I am really disappointed. I used to love BJ's and considered them one of my favorite restaurants to go to in the South Bay. However, things have started declining. After our experience today, we decided that we would not be going back there for a long while. Lazy Dog has just as cheap of a lunch menu with quick and better service.

I saw a group that got seated a couple of minutes before us, order lunch, get their food, eat and pay and leave while we were waiting. I think the wait person forgot to put in the order. We didn't order anything that would take too long to prepare.   I ordered the beef dip sandwich. Bread was dry and hard. The sandwich tasted like cardboard. Small size for price. The wedge fries don't taste like they're even made of potatoes.  This is the second time here and it is very cold inside. Feels good at first but sitting there so long my friends had to put on their jackets.  It seems that they don't care about the customer. There was a short wait but no one bothered to write names down to keep track of who came in first so that we could be seated in order. I can see this leading to angering a customer who comes in and watches other groups of the same size who come in after get seated first. I agree with one reviewer.

224,Ryan W.,"Torrance, CA",863,710,2912.0,4.0,2012-07-13,"The lunch specials really are a great deal! I've been coming to bjs for a while now and here's a rundown of the things that I've ordered previously.  Service: At times can be a little slow, but it depends what time you go. If there's a game on or a weekend night, you can be waiting for a 1-2 hours. **The take-out girl, Tiffany is a cutie patootie :)  Appetizers:      Avocado egg rolls: 4.5 stars. Holy crap these things are amazing! Consists of tons of avocado, cream cheese, onions, cilantro, pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes wrapped in a wanton wrapper and deep fried until golden brown. The thing that makes this appetizer so good is the sauce that they serve alongside. It's packed with flavor and goes so well with the crunch of the wanton wrapper and the soft, creamy texture of the avocado and cream cheese. Definitely try this out!       Calamari: 4 stars. Deep fried calamari that is lightly battered and served with a spicy marinara and a lemon garlic aioli. The calamari itself is very soft and the batter is very light. The sauces go perfectly with the flavor from the calamari. One of the better calamaris that I've had.       Spinach and artichoke dip: 3 stars. Definitely nothing special and I would Not order this again. The blend of cheese, artichokes, and spinach seemed very watery. Compared to other places it was less creamy and seemed to have more of a liquified texture.  Food:      Cajun pasta: 3.5 stars. Fettuccini noodles with blackened chicken, red peppers, red onions in a creamy tomato sauce. I thought the chicken was nicely cooked to keep it moist and flavorful. The creamy tomato sauce packed a punch when it came to flavor and it had a little hint of spiciness to it. I really likes this pasta.       New Orleans jambalaya: 4 stars. I've had jambalaya from many different places and this one is one of the better tasting jambalayas. It consists of shrimps, blackened chicken, chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes in a spicy sauce. The flavors hit you from so many different angles! This dish is packed with different meats and shrimps. Everything is cooked perfectly and it's all served on a bed of rice pilaf which makes the dish just absolutely delicious!       Shrimp scampi pasta: 2.5 stars. Angel hair pasta tossed in olive oil, garlic, butter, Roma tomatoes and lemon juice. Personally I thought they put in way too much lemon juice that it tasted like they put in lemonade without the sugar. Also the Roma tomatoes kind of masked all of the flavors along with the lemon juice. The thing that I love about the dish is the toast that is served alongside the pasta. Some of the most flavorful, crunchy cheese toasts that I've had. A+ on that!       Grilled mahi mahi tacos: 2.5 stars. Two grilled mahi mahi tacos with chipotle mayo, cabbage, onions and cilantro served with a creamy avocado sauce and a fire-roasted tomato sauce. I was a little disappointed with these tacos. It lacked the flavor that I expected it to have. The mahi mahi had no flavor at all and the little cabbage cole slaw that they put on top needed a pinch more salt and black pepper. The two salsas on the side also didn't pack enough heat the way I expected it to. The other disappointing thing was that the dish was just the two tacos by itself. I understand that this dish was part of the lunch special, but it could at least come with something else. I mean, at Wahoos you can actually get two fish tacos, rice and beans for a cheaper price... Dessert:     Pazookie: 4 stars. Obviously this is the thing that they are most known for. They have a great selection of different cookie flavors to please every pallet. They have chocolate chip, red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin walnut, cookies n' cream, or triple chocolate. Personally I like the cookies n' cream, red velvet or the regular chocolate chip the best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=260,3.36,3.27,3.27,3.056,3.306

We ordered drinks and browsed the menu to see what was new. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos (fried) and my fiance ordered the fish and chips, and we were both extremely happy with our orders. My tacos were cooked perfectly, with the cabbage and sauce being perfect, and his fish was DELICIOUS.The server was nice enough, but absent for most of the meal and wasn't good about checking up on refills and other side orders.

My ex and I used to come here all the time and split a medium deep dish pizza - half BJ's Favorite and half with meatball, pepperoni, and bacon. Sounds delicious, right? IT IS! I think we were only able to get 2 slices down each (on a good night), and then we'd have to take the rest home. For drinks,  I'd always go with a strawberry lemonade (which, by the way, is like 1928392819 calories of goodness), and he would get a beer. His favorite was Jeremiah Red, but he was often adventurous if they had a seasonal beer. And people, I don't care how much you've ordered, how full you are, you HAVE to get a pizookie. Go in the bathroom and make yourself heave if you have to make room. *laughs*  Oh man...*mouth waters*...seriously so f'ing sick good. It doesn't matter if you go with choco chip, peanut butter, Ghiradhelli choco, Oreo, or Macadamia nut...ALL of it is good. Shoot, try a pizookie trio and get three flavors with various flavors of ice cream on top. It's free on your birthday!  Quick tip: Do a ""call ahead"" when you're on your way. If your name is on the ""call ahead"" list, you get priority seating when you arrive. It has saved me many a night of anxiety and frustration, because the line (especially on the weekends) are just ridiculous.

The first was in the Huntington Beach Bjs where I had the worse Mohitoes on the planet-yes I've had them in Cuba so know what I am talking about. Anyhoo this second visit in Torrance for my bf birthday-he actually requested the place as he likes the pizza- was only a little better. Since the first visit was one star for their tasteless ""signature drink"" and this second visit was 3 stars I  will balance it out to two stars. Ahem-We went to the Torrance Bj's last Sat night at 645 pm. Parking was tough but free and security everywhere. The place was packed and the wait was told to be 45 min. Rather than wait my bf suggested we lurk in the bar for someone to leave as they serve the same food in there anyway so we did just that and scored a table immediately. I asked our waitress to wipe our table and she ignored me.  But she was busy so ok. That's cool. What is the real travesty is the pizza. My bf was raging about this places pizza as being the best in the world.  He ordered my fav toppings hoping I would agree. We got their special which was pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and tomato. It  had no toppings what to speak of. I mean 5 peperoni if that and the cheese was non existent. I must say though I enjoyed the crust immensely and since it was all crust that was a blessing. I also enjoyed my Malbec very much and the beer selection is indeed very good.  However, we went there for pizza and even my guy who loves this place was disappointed and it was his bday which really upset me.   After we finished our ""crust"" we noticed our neighbors got the exact same pizza and they had 3 times the toppings. We were pretty pissed seeing that. Since I had never had their crust that they try to pass off as pizza I did not know I had grounds to gripe but after seeing our neighbors pizza I was experiencing some mad pizza envy as did my birthday sweetie.  We  used up my gift card in full and proceeded to go see a movie next door, fb bday cheesecake at home. It was a super nice evening but BJ's food and service had nothing to do with it.

No call to me and the several times that I called them, they just kept stating that it would be out.

This is a usual and popular spot for our rep-sponsored happy hours after work.  Aside from all the giggles and smirks that come about when all my nurse friends say ""I love BJ's"", I can honestly say that we always have a great time and a great meal when we go here.  Drinks and appetizers are what we get... The perfectly breaded fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip with the warm and thin-crispy chips, the Italian-twist Ahi poke, and the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and the avocado egg rolls that *everybody* loves... It's great eats, all of it!!! Flatbread pizzas are a must, too!!! We have some fans of the goat cheese flatbread, and the Margherita flatbread disappears as soon as it hits the table!  The potato skin deals need to be eaten right away or the potato itself gets kinda tough to eat as it gets cold...   And the drinks!!! The Jeremiah Red is a favorite for the guys, as well as the Piranha. One of these times I'm gonna skip the cocktails and try one of the brews... There's the Brewhouse Blonde that I'd like to try. I tried the Coconut Mojito last night and it was delicious!!! Two of my girlfriends ordered this Spring-special cocktail and they enjoyed it, as well! Last night was definitely a Mojito night for the ladies.... Strawberry, white peach, pomegranate... One time we went we tried up all of the Martinis. Pomegranate was my favorite, and the lemon drop was an all around favorite.  Yes, this place gets mad crazy and packed, especially after 5pm. If you have a big party (10 or more) definitely make reservations ahead of time to secure a spot for your party! Last night was a last minute deal for all of us, but the staff did their best to accommodate us and we were able to get one of the patios and enjoy our time there before our 9:30pm cut off time (another party had reservations then...) Our other times there, arrangements were made ahead of time and our wait to clear tables and get everything situated wasn't very long. Oh, and there are plenty of heaters to keep you comfortably warm when out on the patios. We seem to always have great service when we're there, so I have no complaints with that...

Servers walked right by us to take orders for the newly seated tables next to us, but ignored us as we tried to get thier attention. On the third pass we stopped the waitress and mentioned our concern and her reply was that we were not her table. So out of three tables next to one another, we were in the wrong spot. She didn't offer to help us, just left us there. We waited for another 5 min and then decided to get up and leave. What the restaurant has transformed into over the past six months has been a gradual decline in service, food quality and helpful attitude by it's staff.

I tried the food on my neph's plate. It was awful, there was hardly any chicken. I saw mostly vegetables. If there was chicken I didn't see it was drowning in their terrible teriyaki sauce.  Jessica came by again and asked how the food was. We told her the teriyaki chicken was terrible, we weren't going to eat it, and we wished we had specified the fries to be put on the side. She shrugged and said, ""Yeahhh, it's not that good, but to be honest, that probably tastes even better than if you had it over rice."" Shrugged again and walked away. Soooo...she ended up taking away a full plate of untouched teriyaki chicken-covered fries. I didn't ask to return the plate because it's what the nephew ordered. and he's 18...if he wanted something else he should've said something. But at the same time, I really wanted our server to do something other than shrug and agree that the food sucks. Like really? Can you please take off that $14 charge perhaps?  Oh well.

The alcohol selection is incredibly expansive, including a wide variety of California and international beers, a nice selection of wives and a large collection of spirits. If the beer choices are too expansive, the staff is more than happy to give you reading samples, or if you'd rather make your own exploration, there is a beer-tasting item on the menu that offers one ounce samples of your choice of any four beers. They also offer a selection of cocktails and mocktails to suit even discriminating tastes. The food menu is huge and covers every facet of American cuisine. I like to judge based on the salads - a simple concept that can be mind-blowing if care and creativity are used. I selected the mango salad because it seemed exotic and strange to me - it ended up being amazing beyond comprehension. The mangoes  compliment tree fairly standard salad by offering a light sweetness that enriches the.flavor of the vinaigrette and the diced tomatoes. in fact, the salad really triples as an appetizer, entree and dessert.

If you're lucky to sit on the left-most aisle, consider yourself lucky! The central aisle, which we sat in most, is also serviced by well attentive servers.  The right-most aisle, we've probably sat in 5 times, and all of those times we had to wait over 10 minutes before our server would greet us, always had problems refilling our drinks and always had an issue with server checking up on us. Other than that, BJ's always hit the spot. If you dine here often like us, be sure to sign up for the Premiere Rewards program. We've redeemed two $25-off coupons already.

Of course, on weekends and game nights there are big crowds, but I've never had an issue. My parents are big fans of the pizzas - BJ's Classic Combo and Sweet Pig are really tasty. The Grilled Burger Melt is my favorite when I'm craving a good burger; but my usual here is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and Ahi Poke. They are both appetizers. but the two of them together makes for a great meal. I usually order the mac and cheese without the bread crumbs  because I find that its less dry and better tasting without it (and ask for some extra bacon pieces on the side! More bacon is always better!) The ahi poke is always really fresh with just the right amount of seasonings and has such great flavor. On my most recent visit, I ordered the ahi poke like normal, but instead of the mac and cheese, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and order something different: chicken wontons and spinach stuffed mushrooms. I wasn't happy. The chicken wontons (you only get three, which, even for an appetizer is rather small) were just not good. The chicken was really chewy and I didn't like how it tasted. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were okay, but the feta cheese was just too overwhelming. I won't order those again. But aside from my poor food choices, I've always had a nice dining experience here. The employees are all friendly and attentive.

353,Jonah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,2013-10-20,"I experienced what may possibly be the worst service I've EVER had at any restaurant I've ever been to at this location.  I had a party of four, in the evening.  We started with a waitress, who I unfortunately cannot remember her name (she was just fine, and in fact a pleasure).  We ordered five drinks, three beers, one liquor drink, and a sparkling lemonade.  I also asked if it would be possible to change one of the six televisions from a football game to a baseball game (Game 6 of the American League Championship series, Red Sox v. Tigers, an important game and one that honestly should have been on a tv already.)  About fifteen minutes after ordering our drinks, we placed our food order (two hamburgers, a steak, and a pizza).  At this time, our waitress informed us that she would be leaving for the evening, and we would be waited on by a young man named Obini.  Our waitress also told me that she had spoken to the manager, and they would be putting the baseball game on the tv presently.   This is where our visit suddenly took a sharp turn for the worst.  We waited another fifteen to twenty minutes before our first drinks arrived at our table.  Obini passed around the drinks, and when he came to me, he sat down my beer, and when I told him that the liquor drink was also mine, he seemed incredulous, and almost refused to give it to me (bearing in mind that it is not an uncommon practice for a grown man to order a beer and a liquor drink with dinner, especially in a bar type setting.)  The baseball game was still not on the television. About ten minutes later, our food was brought to our table, however one of our hamburgers had not even been put in to the kitchen.  Obini said ""That's not MY fault."" and left the table.  At least five minutes passed before he returned and said that he had placed the order in the kitchen.  The baseball game was still not on the television. At this point, my friend ordered a second beer.  At no point did Obini ask if anyone else at the table would like another drink, or a refill on the lemonade (at no point throughout the entire meal did he refill the lemonade.) About ten minutes later, the second hamburger came out, and no sort of apology was offered for it being later (I understand that it might not have been anyones fault, however this is a service industry and a simple apology can go a LONG way).  The baseball game was still not on the television. After finishing our meal, my friend ordered a third beer, at which time Obini said to him ""Are you driving? because you've already had four or five.""  In an incredibly condescending way.  I had also ordered a second beer (in addition to my liquor drink), and another in our group had ordered three drinks, as well.  The fourth member of our group had not ordered ANY alcohol at all, yet nobody else was subjected to his questioning.  Frankly, it was embarassing, especially considering Obini's protests were louder than anyone at our table.  The baseball game was still not on the television. I then asked to see a dessert menu, and Obini left for an inordinate amount of time before returning to take our dessert order.  One person in my group ordered her dessert, and then he walked away, and we had to shout after him to return and take the other THREE dessert orders. There was also a party of young men and women across from us, and I witnessed Obini not only TOUCH one of the UNDERAGE girls on her bare shoulder, but also stand so uncomfortably close to another that she physically moved away from him. He was RUDE, off putting, embarassing, and uppitty, and he alone made our experience so awful that it put a damper on my entire weekend.  I have never in my life seen any waitstaff so ill trained, and with so few manners working in an establishment that I otherwise frequent and enjoy.  And I missed the entire baseball game. UPDATE: I spoke with Scott montero, who is the general manager of this BJ's. He apologized and told me that he would send me a gift card, and to come back in and have another meal. One month passed and I had yet to receive any gift card from him. I sent an email and confirmed that he had my address correct.  Scott montero then told me that he would send the gift cards within the week (this is a month after he told me he had already sent them). Almost another full month later, I still have yet to receive them.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning to this restaurant, even if Scott montero were to actually send me a gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=420,3.08,3.31,3.176,2.468,3.218

But no employee acknowledged us nor told us where to stand to wait to be seated.  We wait patiently to be acknowledged and seated but then another party walks in through the other side of the lobby entrance. They get acknowledged and then escorted ahead of us to their table. So we walk over to that side. After standing there for a while, other people came in after us and were greeted promptly.  Since we were still waiting, we just walked out.

I actually expected I'd hate it - loud, boring chain right in the heart of a giant strip mall? No thanks.

And the service was indeed craptaculous - orders confused or forgotten until asked about, brought out slowly and at widely differing times, difficulty getting extra place settings, all the things you would expect of a place like this. That aside, though, I'll say this: the food was actually pretty good. I was not expecting that, but there you have it. I was expecting one step up in food quality from Denny's - it was several. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't complain about it to the same extent I did this time, either. Their steak was an excellent cut of steak and cooked perfectly; their mango salad was pretty tasty (even if it could have used a lot more mango in it), and their tomato bisque soup was actually one of the best I've tasted.

The beef dip is amazing and the horseradish and aus jus compliment it so well. Give it a shot if you haven't tried it yet.  I hear they make good pizzas, sandwiches and other varieties of food but I can't comment on those from a personal stand point.     BJs crafts their own brew and they have several tasty ones.  I recommend trying the beer sampler which gives you the opportunity to try about 8 of their craft beers. Some of Their seasonal beers are tasty as well.  The most recent one I tried was the pumpkin spice ale and it was very good.  A pizzookie is a must when you come here. Those things are so damn good.  My favorite is the Oreo pizzookie...simply outstanding! In conclusion, BJs is makes some good food and crafts some good brews.  One draw back is that the place gets crowded so depending on the time and day, trying to get a spot at the bar area is near impossible and the wait times can be hefty.

He seemed friendly enough, however three more groups of people proceeded to walk in behind us. He greeted all with the same generic greeting ""hi, party of 3? Step aside....party of 2, step aside..... Etc"" Never once got a name, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought he must have a good memory. Well, as the other hostess came up with an open table he proceeded to seat 2 other groups both party of 2s, that came in after us. Then looked at us and said, ""Oh , they are still cleaning your table"". Needless to say, it's a small thing to do, just greet and take a name so you don't lose track of who came in what order, but he failed to do this. Customers are loyal by the little gestures and respect, not the by the apologies afterward. Which never came. Luckily, we have experienced great service by this restaurant chain consistently, just not at this one unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=880,2.92,3.23,3.208,2.2800000000000002,3.106
891,Karen M.,"Lomita, CA",0,1,,2.0,2014-01-16,"Went here last night for my nephew's birthday.  Everything started out okay, drinks came quickly, waitress was friendly, and appetizers were good.  Then came the food. I didn't like my Black and Bleu burger, the chipotle sauce was strong and hot, way overpowering the flavor of anything else on the burger.  Well, that's okay, I guess I just ordered the wrong thing and I'll know better next time.  But my husband's pork chop and vegetable were COLD. He's not the type to send food back, but he did this time.  Of course by the time he got his meal back, we where all done eating.  And his pork chop was way over cooked (hey BJs, cold and undercooked are not the same thing).  I waitress was nice, but the service was about average.  Thank goodness we didn't have another waitress we enjoyed watching - she spent a large amount of her time flirting with a couple guys at a nearby table. Other people at our table were satisfied with their food, but we won't be back.

The last time it was my wife and son, it was horrible...We called to make a reservation, told on the phone there will be no wait.  When we got there it was a ten minute wait, totally not a big deal.  We got seated and few our son his dinner, as he wont eat the stuff on their menu, and we sat there.  He ate his entire dinner and no one came up to us.  I went to the front and asked if they had a record of when were were seated, we were there for over 20 min and not one person stopped at our table.  I let them know we were leaving and went to get my wife and son.  On the way out the Manager was at the front and blocked us off asking if there was an issue, I was very cordial in telling him that no one stopped at our table and when he asked who the server is I told him I do not know as everyone walked by.  He said if we sat down right now he would get us a waiter. I told him no need as my wife and I were very hungry and tired and were just going home...I called a few days later, not to complain, but to give feedback and let them know what happened.  The manger I talked to had no idea, and really didnt seem to interested, but offered a girft card to us to come back, and I told him that we probably were not coming back in again, he insisted on sending them anyway.  Gave him my address, never got anything (I will not hold this part to him as I dont know if he sent them or not, and if they got lost in the mail)    That was close to a year ago...last week some friends wanted to get together for dinner and  BJs was brought up...had my doubts, but majority rules... We got there a little late and the other couple was already there and had ordered drinks/appetizers...The waitress came up and brought water for us, didnt ask about appetizers...took our orders, and walked away.  the other couple finished their drinks and she took the glases and didnt ask if they wanted more. Our food was brought out by other staff...Everything looked good, couldnt eat it though as the first couple were the only ones with silverware....at this point we havent seen out waitress in about 15 min.  She came out a few minutes later and asked if everything was ok, and that she was going on break.  so we are eating and talking about the service and we are all really let down as if brought the meal down for us.  Our temp wiater who had his own tables though really picked it up for us, checked in every few minutes, asked questions, everything...Our son didnt eat his meal, and the guy took it off the bill, even though i said it was totally fine and not his fault, he still did that.  Then after were were done with desert, the waitress was back on and gave us the bill...The big debate shot up, what do we give for a tip...and how does it get split...we werent sure what the deal was so i took the bill with the money for it to the front... I talked to a hostess about paying and was told it has to be with the server, when I explained that i wanted to plait the tip, I was directed to the manager.  I explained that i did not want to give her much as we felt she didnt deserve it...he didnt really seem to be interested in what i had to say, and let me know that the original server gets the tip, when he took the bill from me he asked what was in it, and I told him strictly the bill only and i wanted to pay the other waiter..he walked over to our table area, and just gave it to the waiter and walked away from me, never talking to me about how to split the tip.....a little discouraging from my view.... I went to the next step, and asked our waited about how to tip him and if we were allowed to, he said yes.  I told him why we were tipping him and the differences in the service.  I also told him that i would be giving his tip to the manager and he could get it from him.   Walked up to the manager on the way out and handed it to him and told him there were two tips.   He took it, said have a good night and walked the other way.... Not asking that something be done on the bill, but at least take the couple minutes to talk to me as a customer....I usually give a second chance to places, but not really in this case....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=620,2.76,3.19,3.212,2.184,3.018

There are a lot of TVs mounted on the front wall of the bar, and lots more around the entire restaurant, all of which are tuned to ESPN or some other sports channels. I guess BJ's is a sports bar. I drank their house stout, which was dark brown and clearly smelled of chocolate and caramel. I first tasted the chocolate and sweetness of the caramel, then I got a bit of the smoky malts, and it finishes off somewhat bitter. It's a medium-to-thick body beer. Stouts should be foamy, with no more than two fingers of head, and have good looking lace, but their brew didn't. So, it leads me to think that the glass I had wasn't that clean, or the hops they used weren't fresh, or both.

141,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,3.0,2014-04-02,"Let me make one thing clear: the food at this BJ's is great. It's comparable to any other BJ's location (if not better -- this location definitely does not skimp on ice cream served with the Pizookies). The lower star rating for this location is for service. On the majority of the times that I've visited this BJ's, the service was usually poor. For example, on my most recent visit, the server didn't even give our party (five people) enough table settings until we asked (repeatedly for it). We constantly had to ask for water refills and extra napkins. Upon (finally) taking our orders, the server only took the order of half of our party (it was only appetizers) and disappeared for a long time before coming back to our table to take the remaining orders. Perhaps it was to already put in some of the appetizer orders? I'm not exactly sure. That being said, we were clearly not done ordering (we ALL ordered appetizers) and he just disappeared midway through the process! All that aside, the food from BJ's is great and I always take out of town guests to the eatery. Of course, BJ's is known for its deep dish pizzas, but the menu contains other hidden gems. Some of my favorites are listed below.  ""Gourmet Mac & Cheese"": This is one of my favorite mac & cheeses. It can serve as an appetizer or as a meal for one. This creamy blend of rotelle pasta is combined with chipotle, garlic and three cheeses. It's topped generously with bacon bits and seasoned breadcrumbs to create a toasted, golden-brown crust.  ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"": One of the pre-set flavors on the deep-dish pizza menu, the ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" is phenomenal. It includes applewood smoked bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, grilled garlic chicken, red onions, diced tomatoes and ranch dressing drizzled on top. I love deep dish pizzas and this one is completely covered with chicken pieces, cheese and ranch dressing. It's definitely a great savory blend. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"": If you're not in the mood for pizza, this is a good pasta option. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"" comprises angel hair pasta (one of my favorite types of pasta) and pieces of chicken sautéed with garlic and topped with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, freshly steamed baby spinach and soaked a lemon butter sauce. Two pieces of cheesy garlic bread also accompany this entrée.  ""Chocolate Chunk/Peanut Butter Pizookie"": Did you know that you can get half of one cookie flavor and half of another in ONE Pizookie? Just ask your server! My default dessert choice is a Pizookie with half ""Chocolate Chunk"" (a cookie generously loaded with milk chocolate chunks) and half ""Peanut Butter."" The Pizookie comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's best when the server brings the Pizookie warm (like fresh-out-of-the-oven warm). It'll be a race against time to keep up with the melting ice cream! ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": To my knowledge, this is the most recent addition to the Pizookie menu, and it's a great salty-sweet combo. While some of the Pizookies are on the sweeter side, this one's blend of flavors result in a moderately sweet dessert. This Pizookie features a caramel cookie with pretzel bites and dark and white chocolate chips. It's topped with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli Squares dark chocolate. On my most recent visit, I gave up my default dessert (see above) to try this new ""Salted Caramel"" option and I was not disappointed. The caramel cookie was soft and chewy, and I loved the texture of the chocolate chips and pretzel bites within. The cookie itself was hot (so the ice cream was melting at an incredibly fast rate), but it wws definitely fresh and the chocolate and caramel were just oozing all over.  ""Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie"": I only ordered this Pizookie once, but it was a delicious one ... chocoholics will surely be pleased with this choice. This Pizookie includes a rich, chocolate cookie with the distinct taste of Oreos. It's topped with three (small) scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. I especially loved the dark chocolate cookie served in this dessert ... it's moist, rich and simply to die for.  All in all, BJ's provides delicious American cuisine, and when there are specials (especially the lunch ones), the prices are reasonable. I like the eatery itself well enough, and the Pizookie desserts (every one that I've tried so far) are phenomenal. But if you're looking for stellar service, this location isn't the best one to visit. You'll have better luck at other locations like the Culver City or Brea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180,2.48,2.99,3.148,2.508,2.7860000000000005
223,Tiffany T.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",512,101,449.0,4.0,2014-04-04,"I'm sure everyone is familiar with BJ's since the first one actually opened  up here in Orange County, California in 1978. Bj's operates several microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's handcrafted beers throughout the chain. (Which is why you can't find then anywhere else expect at BJ's.) BJ's is also credited with creating the ""Pizookie"", a fresh baked cookie (white chocolate and macadamia nut, chocolate chip and many other flavors), with vanilla ice cream, served in a pizza style pan. The first few times I have tried BJ's two years ago (in Newport Beach) I wasn't impressed at all. The food was so-so and it wasn't anything worth remembering. When I had the opportunity to try the BJ's in Torrance I automatically changed my mind. The food here is actually quite delicious. I can tell that they changed the menu quite drastically from just a simple Chicago style pizza joint to an all-round American bar and good eats restaurant. Which included more than just  pizza. They also have flatbreads, pastas, burgers, salads, and creative new appetizers. My personal favorites are: Calfornia Club Flatbread Really warm and crispy with grilled chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzerella cheese, roasted garlic aioli and diced avocados. (Really my FAVORITE dish here!) $9.75 Crispy Fried Artichokes Served with a lemon garlic aioli sauce. (If you like artichokes this is a must!) $4.50   Mini-Bruschetta Grilled focaccia bread topped with melted provolone and a blend of fresh Roma and sun-dried tomatoes, onions, basil and fire-roasted red bell peppers. (The mini bruschetta has a nice crunch in the bite along with the fresh tomatoes and basil finish.) $3.50 Tips: BJ's also has a Premier Rewards program that  earns you 1 point for every $1 you spend at BJ's. 75 points - You get $5 off your meal. 100 points - You get a free Pizookie 150 points - You get $10 off your meal. 350 points - You get $25 off your meal.  Pros: -Closes around 12 midnight! (Great place to grab a late night snack!) -They brew their own beer and they have their own root beer! (Which I think is awesome it actually tastes like root beer and its made fresh.) -The BJ's flatbreads are out of this world! (One of the best I have tried.) -This place is reasonably priced for the quality of food that is given. (The wedge salad here tastes better than the one a Flemings and it about 1/3 of the price.)   Cons: -This place can get quite loud and busy on Friday nights and  weekends. -I ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and overall the dish was soggy and oily. (The only appetizer that I didn't enjoy at BJ's.) -The menu changes quite frequently so when you come back a week later your favorite dish might not be there anymore.

There is always a wait of about 30 minutes or longer to get a table, even for two. Both times I have been sat in a booth (not a big deal) but when the booths are extremely small and your fat, it is hard to try and squeeze in there. I felt like I looked like a I had a mushroom top on the tabletop. The waiter Cory had finally come up after several minutes and just looked at me with a weird look which was more like ""how the heck did he get in that booth, he looks hideous!""  He took my order and was pretty curt. Whenever he would come he would give his weird look and would slam my food or drinks on the table. He wouldn't ask how things were and didn't say anything but put the stuff down on the corner and walk away. On my way back to the car I saw one of the waiters that had just walked out for his break at his car smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. He saw me approaching and turned around to try and hide it but it was too late I already saw it. This is what any customer wants to know is that the staff are outside smoking and drinking on their breaks so they can take extra good care of me when they return. I really want to give this place a higher score...if it was just on the food I would give them four stars as it is pretty darn good. I especially like the Parmesan Chicken and the Low Fat menu. I hope that if I decide to return that I get better service.

It was a Monday night and it was close to 10pm so everything was closed or closing. We headed towards the mall and noticed there were a few restaurants still open. I've never been to a Lazy Dog Cafe and after the way things ended up I wasn't in the mood to gamble the last decision of my day. Since I've been to Bj's many times in different cities I thought I'd win this bet. WRONG. Our server came to greet us, she seemed sweet and took our drink order. She asked if we wanted to start with an appetizer and I thought why not..Avocado Egg Rolls it is! When she brought the appetizer she didn't not bring any plates which made it hard to share so we used napkins. I asked for plates. Just as she dropped off the plates and walked away our entrees arrived. We had not more than a few bites of our appetizers and felt rushed. Oh well I was hoping to get back to the hotel sooner anyway. My girlfriend ordered the Lemon Chicken Pasta and I had another pasta dish that came with olive oil but requested to have cream sauce instead. BTW the person who dropped off the entrees was very short with us, she dropped the food and left. She didn't not ask if we needed anything or if everything looked ok. She must have been a runner/expo I hope not a manager. On to the food. My pasta was angel hair so its easy to overcook, its was mushy and dry. The blackened chicken was dry and tasted like it was made at the beginning of dinner service. My girlfriends entree was the same mushy, pastey and had an overwhelming lemon taste. Our drinks were not refilled throughout the meal and I finally had to ask after positioning my glass at the end of the table. Meanwhile there where 2 bussers at the table next to ours watching soccer while pretending to bus it for 10 minutes. Although our server was nice she didn't seem to be fully engaged in taking care of us. This is probably due to the time of night and Im sure she was juggling side work and trying to squeeze in her tables in between. We presented a credit card as our form of payment but I did hear her ask the table next to us if they needed change. To me that is another sign of rushing or inexperience to assume all of the cash in the guest check holder was hers for the taking. My rating was based on this experience NOT the chain of restaurants.

Considering BJ's used to be a restaurant I really enjoyed coming to, I was SOO disappointed with my recent visit. My party ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetizer to share. The avocados were creamy, but there was really not much else in the rolls.  I didn't taste any sun-dried tomatoes or red onions. Did they forget the pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices? I think the only thing that was listed in the description that was actually on the plate was some cilantro sprinkled on top and the tamarind sauce. I would not get these again. I added a Caesar salad to my entrée, so that came out first. A white, all iceberg lettuce salad. Some of the lettuce was brown and wilted, and there was barely any dressing. There was no taste, and I definitely felt like I wasted my $2.95 to add it to my entrée.  Since they did away with my absolute favorite, Angel Hair Toscana, I was forced to choose another menu item, hoping to get something else that was similar. When I read the description for the Angel Hair Classico, the item they supposedly replaced it with, it just wasn't cutting it for me. So, I decided on the Tuscan Chicken Limone. The chicken was dry. There were two measly clumps of spinach on the side.  Really? THAT is supposed to be my ""fresh steamed baby spinach""?! ( ) Not to mention the garlic bread was hard as a rock. The portions were decently large, but to me it's more about quantity than quality here. I considered giving only 1 star, but the Handcrafted Root Beer was really good.

I never have a problem with the food- I think it's very good. I enjoy the pizza here, and while I realize that true Chicago natives will roll their eyes at their ""deep-dish,"" I still think it's quite good. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. I really like the touch of roasted tomato on top, and I actually don't even like tomatoes. I think the crust is nice and soft with good thickness and crunch along the edges. Come at happy hour and the mini-sized ones are at a really reasonable price. I also quite enjoy the beer selection here. Their house brews are all good, and I think their red is a nice one with a good but not too harsh bite to it.

255,Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",416,445,268.0,3.0,2014-06-24,"So we returned this year for an early birthday party for my boyfriend.. this was a little messier than usual.  I had made the reservation a few days earlier, the earliest they could seat a table of 14 was at 8:00pm--so we took a late dinner reservation.  About 7:30pm we found out our group would be 20 people.. I called and asked if it would be possible to accommodate the add-ons.  I spoke with the manager, Eric, who said yes.  They were seating us in the open seating area and would put the table of 6 nearby (which was fine with me).   Upon arrival, my sister had checked us in already.. so we waited outside.  Wasn't much of a wait that by 8:15pm we were seated in a side room.. which was fine, I was told the table next to it had been there for 1:15 hour and it was up to us to wait.  They made it sound like they were leaving soon..  At this point maybe 15 of our party had arrived, but by 8:30pm everyone was there, standing room for the latecomers.  AND the table of 6 hadn't even gotten their dinner yet--in fact they didn't get it until 8:30pm, we saw them get served.. what the heck?!  I know they'd been there for over an hour, but that was a big failure to tell us that they hadn't even been served their food yet. Eventually the OTHER side room with a group cleared out and we were moved, this was probably 9:15pm.  This was a very very very very long dinner.  Cory, who ended up being our final waiter in that room that night, and he was a gem.  Very patient with us, checked up on us, kept our cups filled.   The pizza.. I don't know who cut it.  We would have slices anywhere from 1"" wide to 4"" wide, and some were stubby.. terrible job with the slicing.  Some of the pizzas had portions that had no filling towards the edge, and were just great puffs of bread.  And the deep dish, albeit deep--was either not cooked enough or just came out floppy.  We would lift a slice and it would literally fall apart just trying to get on the spatula.  I do not know what was going on the kitchen that night.  No one complained, everyone was starving, but still. We didn't end up out of the place til almost 11pm.  We ordered 11 mini pizookies at 10:15pm and it took 30 minutes to get to us.. it was so.. long.. our friends joked if they were making the cookie dough from scratch. I like you BJs, but this was messy.  If you couldn't accommodate the changes, we would have moved the group of 6 elsewhere, just be honest.  Your server was great, your food was mediocre at best that night, and the kitchen was slow.  Ay yi yi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=280,2.96,2.81,3.072,3.0200000000000005,2.87

184,Scott Z.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1682,590,347.0,3.0,2014-07-03,"I'm going to say the jury is out for me on BJ's...one visit isn't terribly representative of a place unless it is great or horrible, and BJ's was just...just...okay for me. We came here prior to seeing a movie at the Del Amo multiplex.  There is ample parking whether you chose the structures, or the adjacent lots.  No worries there.  There is also over a dozen other eateries within walking distance, so if one place is jumping, it seems the other places work overflow pretty well. BJ's does have a pretty big menu...I got a salmon salad, my lady got a pasta dish.  Meh, they were okay, but not something super memorable.  While there seemed to be other items on the menu (pizzas, sandwiches, and salads) most of the menu is really high in calories.  I only saw 1/2 a page of lighter choices, and that's disappointing.   Although if you really wanted to sin, BJ's is known for their signature dessert, the Pizookie.  Which happens to be a pan sized cookie, served hot with ice cream and toppings.  Sort of like a cookie sundae or a hip-slapping, ass-popping, gut-bumping, rush of sugar that makes you go mmmmmhhmmmmm.  Seemed like everyone around us ordered one...or two!  Oh, America...land of the free and home of the morbidly obese.  Now I'm not saying I wouldn't try one, just make sure to share it with 84 of my closest friends.  With that much sugar (after a pretty fatty meal mind you) you could easily choke a donkey. Now, because we were in a rush to make our movie, we were able to get bar seating even though there was a 35 min wait.  Winner! The hostesses, and all were very very nice...the bar staff moved quickly and also did everything they could to make the experience worthwhile. I tried one of their in-house brewed beers, an amber, and it was ok...it was not a big production high-end beer...but it was beer.  It will eventually get you drunk, and no matter what it will assist you in making poor decisions.  Beer...it's probably how a lot of us got here.

This is just your typical American cuisine chain that really does not do anything that special, but rather just has a little bit of everything. Going to any American restaurant is a little hard considering that I tend to eat fairly healthy, except when it comes to pizookie's, so I do appreciate that they have a ""skinny"" menu. So I came with a huge group, 25, and luckily was able to get a reservation. We were seated immediately any had two main servers.  I skipped on the appetizers because there was nothing healthy that seemed appetizing really. For my entree I wen't for the mahi mahi which was listed at 420 calories. At 13 bucks I expected at the least a little pepper or salt, but this was literally the most bland piece of fish I have ever had. I had to ask for a the siracha and lots of it. The bed of rice and veggies that the fish sat atop of was bland as well except for the pineapple that it came with. This was literally 13 bucks of crap on a plate. Never again will I ever order this and neither should you! BJ's I would never come back if it not were for the pizookie's which are absolutely god sent. Then again it is pretty difficult to mess up a fresh baked cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely delicious, unlike the previous dish which was gross.  I know service can be difficult considering how busy BJ's normally is; I'm not exactly sure why to be honest. For twenty five people though we should be first priority considering you get the biggest freiking tip from us. We were only attended to when it came to getting our dishes, and any time after that we did not seem them once. What a shame, they deserved the most minimal tip, but of course with such a big party we didn't have a choice but to tip big.

Bf had also ordered me a strawberry pina colada mixture of some sort.  Not bad at all.  I had to mix it up, otherwise there were a few sips that were quite sweet. Food-wise, definitely enjoyed the mozzarella sticks.  Crunchy, good amount of cheese, and marinara sauce was good.  Fresh parmesan on top didn't cause an issue, either :)   Bf absolutely LOVED his ham/bacon/turkey sandwich.  He said it had the perfect balance of crisp/crunch of the grilled panini-style bread, and that the turkey/ham/bacon combination meshed well with the cheese and the overall flavor.  I think he said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had... @_@;; For me, the Santa Fe salad was good.  Fresh ingredients and good size.  Was hoping for more spice, but the chicken with cayenne pepper wasn't bad at all. The service was very polite, but there were times when it felt like it was a little slow. Felt like a standard BJ's, but the doors are awesome!

Normally I wouldn't leave a bad review for restaurant service because I get it, sometimes you just have a bad day and it is what it is; but at this particular location I've had 3 separate incidents where the waiter was for lack of better words...AWFUL. One can only assume that there is bad or lacking management in place?  My most recent incident was just last week. I got stuck with some waiter who must have judged me right off the bat. It was just me and my young 4 year old son. We were on a mommy and me lunch date. I don't know if he just saw us and thought automatically that I was going to leave a lousy tip or what....he blew me off multiple times, I called for him as he walked by and he just kept walking. I ordered some appetizers, my meal and my son's meal and then a meal to go for my husband. He only brought out my appetizers and put in my meal and my husbands as ""to go"" when I made it clear I only wanted ""one to go"".  He was just beyond a hot mess. I clearly was so frustrated that a young lady, she must have been a supervisor or asst. manager spotted me and came to my rescue. I handed her my card and paid for my tab. I just wanted out of there. He had the audacity to come back after I paid and brought me my check. HA! I paid already , just please get me my boxes.  I normally leave $20 tips no matter what the bill...but I made it clear by writing on the receipt ""Worst service EVER"" and left him a $10 tip only so he could see that if thats how much he got as a half assed server how much more would I have tipped if I had actually been happy. It's sad...I don't know why service is lacking at this location. They have decent food so it's a shame that I will be avoiding this place like the plague.

I've been to this restaurant too many times to the count, and the food is always pretty good. But tonight we were lucky enough to come across a server who was so kind, so caring and attentive that I had to write a review just on him (which I've never done before). Joe approached us like we were the important people in the room, treating us with the utmost kindness and respect. It threw us off immediately, usually servers here are just okay. Joe was so sweet and different, he genuinely cared about us and even went out of his way to get us the best deals possible. Such a stand up employee and person. On top of his wonderful attitude, he was prompt, on top of things even though his section was full and he doted on us without missing a beat. BJ's, I hope you are treating your server right, because you are lucky to have someone who is such a needle in a haystack. In all my years of visiting restaurants, I've never come across anyone like Joe. I sincerely recommend you give him a token of appreciation because this guy goes way above and beyond what a server needs to or gets PAID to.

The ambience was the same as everywhere, clean, calming music, and not very busy at all. Thats why I am bothered with the way this BJ's was scored.  So I sit down at a booth at the bar tell my host there would be two more people joining . As My waiter goes to bring the extra  menus my nose begins to bleed probably from my lack of food cuz I was really hungry!  So I asked for some napkins. The waiter comes back with only TWO NAPKINs. Really!?!? Ok Maybe they have to keep their inventory real tight. I can understand.  After a few minutes he returns with my beer and doesn't comeback to check if I was ready so I got up towards the bar pretending that I did not know how the ordering went about. Obviously I did if I wanted to order from the bar tender I would've sat at the bar. Fortunately for this establishment ""the manager"" (he never introduced himself as the manager, or wore a name tag but he was wearing a light green button up shirt) stopped me from speaking to the bartender and requested the waiter to take my order.  I ordered an Alfredo Fettucini (with no chicken) pasta and salad lunch special and an order of avocado egg rolls- My favorite!  Ten minutes later the avocado egg rolls arrive and they look funny?!?! They were super burnt and still served them on my plate! I was quite surprised with this because I was not even that busy at the bar section. Really BJ's?!? I call ""the manager"" and he stopped me from finishing my statement and reordered my because of how burnt the egg rolls were.  A little rude but I liked his ""call to action"".  So I pretty much got all of my food at the same time... Whatever I was hungry. My avocado egg rolls were now delicious! The mozzarella salad was great and when they brought my Fettucini Alfredo IT HAD CHICKEN!!! What is this like Strike 4!?!  Really BJ's in Carson I just remembered that the last time I came to this same location my order was just as bad with mistakes and mishaps. Last time I received my order as I walked out the door because of how many times they had to fix my order.

Came here with a large group (15) from work, which in retrospect was a mistake.  We had a reservation, which they told us we did not at first.  When we asked if we they could still accomodate us, they reluctantly said yes and then we got a little attitude.  Then they realized they did have a reservation and were actually just unprepared.  They offered us two options, one of which broke us up (which shouldn't have even been an option) and the other which was across a few smaller tables.  After being left to stare at the tables, we started moving then ourselves, which they eventually helped us set up, didn't give us enough seats (about 12).  We again had to take it into our own hands and make our room to seat the other 3. We were in a good mood from the prior event, so we were still optimistic it was the right choice.  The service from the waitress was prompt but with an attitude the whole time, especially to the person who eventually was taking the check.  He remained polite to her but was not happy.   We ordered a good amount of food, and when we ran out of room on the tables, we asked her to take empty plates that had been sitting there, which annoyed her. The food was pretty good and so was the beer.  The servings were a but small so we had to place a second round. Sliders - tender and pretty tasty Mozzarella sticks - pretty good Wings - pretty good Pizza - ok, but typical for Southern Cali.  More.chicago deep dish style Spinach Dip - pretty typical I forgot what else we got, but nothing to really write home about. For beer, their Red was really good, their stout tasted a bit flat, and a few people really liked their Blond Ale. Overall, probably ok place if you are at the mall and want to sit down with a couple buddies to watch the game.  Food is typical bar food that tastes like something you would buy in bulk at Sam's Club and warm up in oven.  Servings are pretty small and beer is pretty good because they have their own selection.  I doubt I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=220,3.12,2.93,3.076,2.8560000000000003,3.0060000000000002

151,Amber L.,"San Pedro, CA",573,330,7124.0,4.0,2015-01-24,"Each time I've come to BJ's, it has been a pretty good experience. I'd have to say that the worst was some months back when I called to make a reservation and the hostess took the reservation and confirmed the time of 7pm. Here's the problem...we get to the restaurant in time for our reservation and the hostess tells us that they don't take reservations. I told her that we called and made a reservation. Surprisingly she admitted to being the one that I talked to. She said it wasn't a reservation, but just being put on the wait list. Well even though I was pissed about that, I figured I could go ahead and wait a little bit, but when she told me that the current wait was at least 45 minutes, My irritation finally surfaced. I told her that she should have told me that they don't take reservations when I called. She should have explained this wait list crap. When someone calls requesting a reservation, their expecting exactly that. To my surprise, she apologized and put us as next to be seated. That was the last time that I came, but I figured I'd give it another shot. Fast forward to last night, some coworkers and I went for dinner and drinks. We were immediately seated and served by Chazz! He was absolutely awesome! He was patient with us, because we did take awhile before we ordered appetizers because we were so busy talking and he helped us with our drink orders. Most of us ordered beers, but me and another friend ordered ciders. She got a cider and beer mix and I couldn't decide, so Chazz told me that he could bring me samples of the ciders on tap. That was awesome, because I had no idea that you could sample it first. He brought me a sample of the berry and pear ciders. Both were really good, but I chose the berry. Here's the other thing...I'm not a big drinker, especially with beer, but Chazz told me that they have small glasses that are the size of the cider samples that he brought out to me, only their filled up. Perfect! And they were around $2.00 for that small glass.  We orderes various appetizers: The hot and spicy chicken wings that come with a side of wing sauce and ranch dressing. They were good, but the problem is that in the picture, they are completely coated with wing sauce. When we got them, they were bare, with light drizzles of wing sauce, so all of us were trying to coat our wings with that little side of sauce. #irritating! The small starter salad: The Golden Beet and Arugula Salad is made with diced golden beets, arugula, and red onions tossed in a strawberry goat cheese vinaigrette and topped with goat cheese, toasted almonds, and dried cranberries. I can tell you that I am one person who hates beets, but because I know that their really good for you, I make myself eat them or have it in a smoothie (a la Whole Foods). This salad however surprised us all! It was freakin delicious!!! It was a small one-person salad, but we all took some bites of it. After eating the golden beets, I now know that it's red beets that I don't like, because the golden ones were mild and delicious!  The crispy fried artichokes were lightly breaded and fried artichoke hearts sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with lemon garlic aioli. They were okay...kind of small, not the biggest amount of flavor, but I'd probably try them again. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were also an okay dish. They are mushrooms filled with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and topped with a lemon pesto sauce. They probably would have been better if the mushrooms were bigger. These were literally bite sized, so you didn't necessarily taste all of the ingredients that are supposed to be in it.  The corn fritters with bacon aioli were little balls made with jack and cheddar cheeses and jalapeños, breaded and lightly fried. They serve it with tangy bacon aioli, smoked bacon, corn and green onions. Another okay dish, but I think I need to try it again.  As Daniel W said, BJs is located at Del Amo Mall where there's plenty to do. It's on the outside of the mall with a movie theatre and bowling alley upstairs. If you get there early enough, you can all shop in some of the outside stores. And whatever you do, don't forget to get a pizookie for dessert at the end of your meal...hell, even first! My favorite is the triple chocolate Ghirardelli!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180,3.32,3.15,3.096,2.448,3.218

The beer is excellent and the food is okay, but neither of these make up for the extremely slow service.  We ordered as soon as our waiter (finally) came over.  It took about 20 minutes before our drinks came and about 35-40 for the food.  Then, it took about 15 minutes after we were done eating to track down our waiter to get the check, plus another 10 for him to bring it.  Another friend who was there at the same time, waited 45 minutes to even order.   The small appetizer salads are quite good (but small is the key word). The ahi poke was kind of tasteless this time, though it has been good in the past.  My daughter really liked the spaghetti with marinara and my husband said the small veggie deep dish pizza was good as well.  I like that they have calories on the menu, but there is almost nothing the least bit healthy or under 1,000 calories.  I will say again that the beer is very good, so if you want to just sit at the bar and drink beer, the service is probably better and the beer is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=500,3.4,3.12,3.072,2.2800000000000002,3.2320000000000007

The reason for the 1 stars is for attitude and what I would say would be a health code violation of some sort regarding food. I am not a food professional so I could be wrong, but what I do possess is common sense. Our table received some of the avocado egg role which the server just plopped down and walked away without so much as a ""enjoy"", ""heres your food"" or even a ""kiss my ass"" would have sufficed. But no, we get just food put down and we tried to get his attention ""excuse me excuse me"" to no avail. So we waited while we looked around for our original server Katrina to come by so we could tell her that this was not our order. It took about 5 minutes to find someone, all the while the appetizer just sitting at our table. We finally saw our server and she realized it was not ours and basically took the appetizer and gave it to the right table which was next to ours. At this point I was completely appalled. I am not a food service professional nor have I ever worked in the food service industry BUT as a customer if I knew that my dish was sitting at someone else's table for longer than a minute and then transferred to my table you bet your sweet ass I would be completely livid. We did not touch the appetizer or do anything to it, but the fact that she was very nonchalant about it and didn't think twice to just move it over leads me to believe that this has happened more than once and the chances of all guests not touching what was put in front of them on accident are slim to none. She gave a dish that could have been tampered with to another table knowing full well it had been sitting at our table first. I am stilled appalled and when I told my other friends about it too, they were also appalled. I for one will not return to this particular BJs because who knows where my foods been since it was out from the kitchen. Not to mention the service sucks. I wouldn't go so far to say that our waitress was rude but you could tell she was having a bad day or maybe she just doesn't like her job but nonetheless service/friendliness NOT TO MENTION CLEANLINESS are issues that should be addressed.

Okay, well since we had reservations shouldn't we just get the first available table?? 45 minutes later, same hostess said okay they were cleaning the table.

He only offered more bread or perhaps a dessert. Very poor customer service. I wasn't looking to get my meal comp'd but after ruining my meal, it would seem appropriate that the manager of this establishment take adequate measures to amend this situation--more than assuring that it wasn't hair, but a long piece of lint from their towels.

Items I took bites of: * Ahi Poke Appetizer had a lovely plating!  I wasn't all that impressed with the ahi poke, but it was okay.  The pieces of ahi were a little larger than I like, they were good sized chunks!  The little wonton triangles were cool in the presentation, however, I didn't really need to eat them with the poke. * Clam Chowder was super creamy and thick, New England style.  It had noticeable clam bits in it.  I really appreciate that the soup came out nice and hot. * Chicken Lettuce Wraps were tasty!  I do have a favorite place to get them from, but this was something I'd order again from here.  I think the Sesame Soy Sauce didn't complement the wrap, but I did like the Chinese Mustard! * 16 oz Bone-In New York Steak - steak with choice of 2 sides, we chose roasted asparagus & steamed green beans.  We ordered the steak medium rare, but for some reason, it was overly chewy!  The initial flavor of the steak was really great, but then the steak left a lot to be desired after having to really chew it.  The asparagus was super stringy and too much effort to eat, so we notified the server and he asked us what other side we wanted.  Nice job!!  The green beans were okay, nothing special, but some crispy bacon bits might have added an extra level of flavor to them. * White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes were brought out as a replacement for our asparagus.  Thank you!  And I must add that these are excellent in flavor and texture!   These items I either barely tasted or didn't taste: * Barbeque Pulled Pork Sandwich - pork tossed in their smoked BBQ Ranch Sauce and topped with crispy onion strings * BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter - a pulled pork slider and a spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin seasoned fries, & coleslaw * Soup & Salad Combo (Caesar Salad & Chicken Tortilla Soup) - they don't offer the UNLIMITED combo on the weekends.  I thought the soup was too acidic for my liking.  I did pick out some of the avocado pieces along with the tortilla strips.  The server poured the soup on top of the accompanying toppings as soon as he was in front of us.  That was pretty cool!  I like the lime wedge which is speared so you can grab it easily.  (   ) * Carnitas Fries sans Cilantro - shredded pork with roasted green chili sauce and a mixture of jack and cheddar cheese which is topped with freshly chopped onions.  The plating of this is unique, it comes in a metal pan.

471,Cerene C.,"Carson, CA",0,12,3.0,2.0,2015-04-08,"First off, me and my bf have been here a couple of times because of their pizookie. I love thie place. But one unfortunate thing happened. Me and my bf decided to eat here today for some good food and pizookie at around 3:45pm. It wasn't packed and we got a seat as soon as we got there. So all is good. We ordered our food. My boyfriend got the salmon and I got the southern chicken. Then we waited  and waited some more. We saw people who came after us got their food.  Then after an hour (more or less) of waiting, the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait. He said that the salmon accidentally got served to another table. He offered us free soup (we got the tomato soup) and it was good.  Food wise, there's really no complains. What annoys me the most was our server (she's a blond one, I forgot her name). Never did she update us about our food while we were waiting for so long. When we got our order, never did she apologize for the long wait. And when we were almost done eating, she went to us with the check already before asking us if we want some dessert. We told her we wanted the pizookie so she took back the check and left. We got our pizookie (triple chocolate) and it looked so good. A few minutes after we got the pizookie, she came back with the check again and said 'no rush, it's for your convenience'. So we just put our card while we continued eating. She rushed to get our card then came back for the receipt. We were not even halfway the pizookie yet (my bf and i were just sharing) so we didn't sign the check yet. Then she went back again to go get the receipt and we told her we haven't signed yet. A few minutes later she went back and we haven't signed it yet again. So I told my bf just to sign it to get it over with. It's just an unpleasant experience because it felt like she was rushing us. It wasn't our fault in the first place that we were there so long. It was the ""swapped salmon's"" fault. She even just came to us once to ask how we were doing and it looked like she didn't want to be there. To the manager who came to our table to apologize and offered us free soup, thank you so much. You are professional and you seems to care for your customers greatly. To that blonde woman who unfortunately was our server for the day, I hope that you don't rush every customers that you serve. Learn to smile genuinely. Learn to care about your customers. Learn ""customer service"". We weren't going to tip you but we still did. That doesn't mean you deserve it. You ruined what could've been a pleasant experience for me and my bf. It looked like you didn't even want to be there in the first place. I got news for you girl, there's plenty of people dying to be in your place right now. And I'm sure that they're going to do a better job than you.

I had to send them both back and ended up going with a Sam Adams --- so much for the micro brews.  The deep dish pizza tasted frozen and was super doughy. Even with 5-6 toppings, it was tasteless until we added a ton of cracked red pepper and/or hot sauce.  None of the toppings are fresh -- the sausage is basically the same as Pizza Hut or Dominos.  The only reason I'm giving 2-stars instead of one is because of the Pazookie. I suppose it's hard to mess up a giant cookie with ice-cream.

FOOD / DRINKS The food is pretty good. It isn't super oily compared to other American restaurants and I like how there is variety. Also, I think there is a healthier menu? For my entree, I usually get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken or the House Top Sirloin. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken comes with two big pieces of chicken and two chosen sides. Because I don't like the sides, I always ask if I can substitute them and they have no problem doing so. The chicken is really tender and not dry at all although sometimes it does come a little burnt. For the House Top Sirloin, it comes with the steak and two sides of your choice. Personally, it is way too fatty and oily for me, but I still love how it tastes. Both come is great portions and you will be extremely full.  I think the Cream Soda / Orange Cream Soda or Root Bear is a must try. It is actually really good and I almost never drink soda. It's not too sweet and it is definitely worth it. When I'm not feeling that, I get the Fresh-squeezed Strawberry Lemonade. This drink is really sweet but nonetheless, it tastes delicious. SERVICE The wait here can get pretty long because it is at Del Amo Fashion Center and it's usually busy all the time. Typically, you'll have to wait around 30-40 minutes dinner time. I would get there early if I were you. But the place really is a hit or miss. I've had times where my food was brought out so quick, I barely finished my appetizer. And other times where I waited for a good 15-20 minutes before it came. It really just depends on the waiter you get I guess. The Cream Sodas/Orange Cream Sodas/Root Beer comes from the bar so it takes awhile for it to come. If you want a refill, grab the waiter halfway through your glass. PARKING The horror. Parking here is almost impossible on the weekends and even dinner time weekdays. I hate coming to this location because I know I'm going to have to circle the parking lot a million years before finding a spot. I know I could park at the structure near Buffalo Wild Wings, but the walk will be so far and I wouldn't say I'm lazy but it's just too far. The spots here are also really small so if you drive a big car, you might have a hard time. Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan. I think their food is pretty good and it's of good value.

This time I went in for dinner and sat at the bar and it was very clean.  Food/Drinks: I ordered a Jeremiah Red and a Caesar salad to start. There were a little too many croutons in my salad for me, but it was still pretty good. I also ordered a Buffalo Chicken pizza, Tavern-cut style. I feel like the ingredients were all centered and weren't as many on the edges of the pizza. When it came to pulling the side slices, it was a basically cheese flatbread. Service: We were instantly greeted by a bartender. She brought our drinks right away and was very diligent. She placed a napkin and utensil setups in front of us. The food runners were also very polite and thorough. They brought everything that we needed such as share plates and ranch when we asked for it. Because there was a birthday, the bartender ordered a birthday Pazookie for us. It came out in decent time, but as I was taking bites, I noticed it was under cooked. And it was definitely confirmed the next morning if you catch my drift. Overall Experience: I always go to BJ's for a Buffalo Chicken pizza and a beer. This was the first time I tried the pizza as Tavern-cut style. I would just prefer if they spread the ingredients out a little better. And I hope they get better about cookie their Pazookie more thoroughly.  I'll come back whenever I need my fix for this pizza again minus the Pazookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180,2.84,2.99,3.004,2.572,2.9299999999999997

140,Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,593,546.0,2.0,2015-06-18,"Overview: This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is an upscale American restaurant that serves a variety of popular entrees such as steak, fish, pork chops, and both deep dish and flatbread pizza. Everything here feels generic, likely due to the breadth of the menu, and I feel like there's not really a ""signature"" dish even though on their menu many items say ""signature"" in the title. Yes, this is the home of the pizookie (large cookie with ice cream) but really... it's not that special. Expect to pay about $20 a person here with an entree, beer, and a shared dessert. The Establishment: Located in a beautiful outdoor mall in west Torrance with lots of parking lots surrounding the shops. Next to a P.F. Chang's along with assorted upscale department stores. Dimly lit, and decorated with upscale materials. No problems here. The Service: The chefs are quite quick, my server was ridiculously efficient in processing the bill, but I did notice a bit of ""attitude"" and impersonal behavior (looking away from you as they take your order) here. The Food: Here's why BJ's gets 2 stars. Let's use the pizza an example because it's the last item I ordered here and it's fresh in my mind. As of June, 2015, you'll pay $25 for a 14"" deep dish ""BJ's Favorite"" which is equivalent to any other pizza joint's ""the works"" or ""supreme."" What I received was lower quality than any Pizza Hut pizza I've had in the past 5 years. Spongy, stingy on the ingredients, uneven spread, hardly any cheese... why didn't I just pay half the price for a better pizza at my local take-out pizza chain?? I took a photo below of the nicest section of the pizza, but trust me, 1-2 slices were sparsely topped and the layer of cheese is quite thin (in my opinion). I must admit I've only been to BJ's about 3 times in the past and have tried their burger, their pizookie, one of their beers, and a pasta dish, and every time they've been more bland than the equivalent dish at a ""specialty"" place that concentrated on one genre of food. With such a wide menu, I understand why BJ's jack of all trades is a master of none. Conclusions: This BJ's is in a wonderful location and is decorated well, but it serves very middle-of-the-road food at inflated prices. I hope that in the future, the franchise owners chose to slim down their menu and concentrate on perfecting a few choice dishes rather than try to appease every potential customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180,2.72,2.95,2.996,2.3760000000000003,2.8580000000000005

It was so bland I tried to enjoy it. I asked our server for more parmesan cheese but never received it. I used more salt than I care too and ate about 1/3 because I was so hungry. My daughters shrimp scampi also had the top ramen noodle effect. They must pre cook the pasta and use it as needed. It was very soggy on its way out.

He was the most pleasant, attentive, knowledgeable and amazing server I have had at a restaurant in a long time.  He made excellent beer selection suggestions and always kept us updated on how our orders were progressing.  This made the wait for the food seem like nothing. The beers were great (I had an Amber Oasis and the rest of the table ordered Jeremiah Reds).  A pint was about $5.75 for most beers, but they also offered pitchers.   The food itself was average, nothing too spectacular.  We started with calamari for an appetizer, and it was JUST enough for 2 people.  I definitely wouldn't recommend just one order for a larger party.  For the main course I ordered a 9"" ""sweet pig"" deep dish pizza.  The crust was excellent, not too saucy, and good amount of toppings.  HOWEVER, the price was ridiculous coming in at over $10.  Another person ordered the salmon, and it seemed pretty average.  The vegetables looked like the kind you buy frozen and then steam, the salmon was grilled (but nothing significant), and the price was your average Uncle Ben's rice. We finished with a pizookie which never disappoints, but again, not really shareable beyond 2 people. Overall, for a calamari appetizer, two small pizzas, three beers, a salmon dinner and a pizookie the bill came out to $90.  I'm deducting one star because for $100, I feel like the food quality and portions could've been a lot better.   The only reason I'd probably come back is for Happy Hour or something where the food is cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=420,2.84,2.91,2.928,3.12,2.8819999999999997

I had to flag him down any time we needed something - and since I got only get his attention twice, we did not have the meal we wanted. for example I ordered fish and chips and was not given malt vinegar, no problem usually unless your waiter doesn't come by for another 30 minutes, so i went without. likewise, we would have ordered another round or 2 of drinks, but we're not given the opportunity.  We were beginning to think that Moses was just a bad waiter, but then another couple was sat across from us. Mind you, I am in a lesbian interracial relationship and the couple across from us was white and heterosexual. Moses paid them 100000000 times more attention - so much so it was hard to miss. He even squatted down at their table to tell them any specials and all of that. They were sat, fed, paid and gone and he whole time Moses ignored us completely.

Thought it would be great to hit up something casual, quick and a bit on the ""chain"" side of dining in the South Bay. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this to happen. Now we're not one to loose patience too easily, thankfully. We are also very much at ease with mistakes and some levels of just bad business. But, when management just doesn't care and has that attitude of ""well, it is what it is. Can't help you"", especially when you're more than kind and patient! I gotta warn my friends!  So, I ordered one of the BJ Stouts, my wife ordered a nice glass of Le Creme wine. My Stout shows up in a nice tall beer glass. The wine? In a nice short wine carafe but with a wide mouthed flute styled beer glass! WHAT? So, we ask our more than helpful and clearly frustrated water, ""are you out of wine glasses?"" He responds, ""yeah, don't know why but we only have a few today"". Everyone is ordering wine and we don't have wine glasses. Ok, well clearly something was up and it suddenly turned into a ""principle"" matter. So, being my wife's husband, I chose not to drink my beer and wait till a wine glass showed up. Clearly our waiter was frustrated as we weren't the only ones in this position. I stepped up to the bar and asked the bar back if they had any to help out our waiter, she too said nope don't have any. REALLY? Are we acting spoiled or are we amazed that a chain establishment doesn't have enough wine glasses? Really? Pretty amazed to say the least! The manager must of walked by 10 times, Looked right at us and our drinks could clearly see we weren't happy and didn't even ask or say a word. Well, we made the effort and spoke MR. ERIC FLORES the manager about this wine glass issue. HIs demeanor? Couldn't care less and knew that if we left unhappy, someone else would sit where we were. He basically said, ""yeah, don't know what happened or why we don't have any wine glasses. Oh well, maybe they broke or something last night"". Couldn't give a damn about the customers! I sat there and just stared at him and didn't say a word. He then walked away. No, apology. Or, ""Oh, we'll take your beer and wine off the tab. No, let me see what I can do"". Nothing.  Maybe it's a bit  petty cause they did have a beer glass at least?  However, if there was even a thread of courtesy to us as the ""CUSTOMER""... we would have been ok. I think my wife would have had the wine in the tall flute style beer glass. However, the attitude that manager threw mixed with his I don't care about you demeanor was out of control! Food was par, our waiter was clearly overwhelmed. Hate to say this, ""we will not be returning to this BJ's"". Oh, after the brussels and pizza and moments before the check arrived... a wine glass showed up and they actually did take the $3.47 off the bill for the glass of wine.

Drinks come fast and are amazing, sadly the cheese sticks were out almost the same time it took to make the drinks, and were cold. It took another 5 minutes of trying to get someone's attention to get the plate replaced with the same food just reheated.  We are halfway through our drinks and are trying to get someone's attention (again) for some water or a coke, the whole time our server flops our food on the table or seems disinterested in our visit it's off putting.

134,Brian S.,"North Tustin, CA",250,366,881.0,2.0,2015-10-11,"Been here 4 or 5 times, most of those were in the bar, a couple were in the dining room. Usually service is not bad, especially in the bar.  Food and beer are decent, as anyone who's been to BJ's before is probably familiar with.  The dining room is another matter.  Today (10/10) went for a family birthday gathering with 4 adults and 2 kids which was not very good.... Called ahead to get on the ""priority seating"" list which really means nothing.  All that it means is that if you get there and check in at the same time as another party of 4 that didn't call ahead, you'll be one ahead of them on the list.  They told us it would be 20 minutes when they handed me the pager, which then took 50 minutes.  I don't mind a few extra minutes while a table is cleared, but that was pretty rough. We were then seated and it took a little while for someone to bring our drinks.   Appetizers came out a reasonable time after, but both were below average in quality and appearance, which was surprising, because I dine at BJ's at a regular basis and I know what to expect.  Also didn't look anything like the menu. Ordered our entrees while waiting for appetizers.  Food took a while, but then came out and tasted pretty good and was reasonably hot.  Was definitely a notch above the mediocre appetizers.   However, wait staff refilled drinks once and acted like we were troubling them to get anything (water, sugar for tea).  Also took about 15 minutes to clear dirty plates. Near the end of the meal, brought wrong dessert 15 minutes after ordering.  After informing them, it took another 10 minutes to bring the right dessert. The worst part came as we were getting ready to leave.  It turns out halfway through our dinner, the table was cleared of 4 (unused) appetizer plates.  There was a birthday card (unopened) with a gift card inside which was a white envelope leaning against these plates.  Somehow, the plates and the envelope were swooped away at the same time.  Nobody noticed because we were busy trying to eat our food, have a conversation, and control two small kids.  But when we all got up to leave, we were surprised we didn't see it anymore, and nobody had grabbed it.  I was the last one to get up, reached back to pick up my wallet off the table and that was the only thing there.  5 minutes later, I realized nobody had the card, went back and there was no sign of the it anywhere - spoke to hostess, and all but the waiter said they didn't see it.  He said he'd noticed it earlier, but not later in the meal.  I talked to my family and we were all in disbelief and frantically trying to remember who saw it last, which was fruitless.  After attempting to get further clarification there was nobody else left to speak to in the restaurant, so I then left.  Essentially, all evidence suggests a worker picked it up with the plates and threw it away, or (worse) actually decided to keep it for themselves. Won't be back unfortunately, not just because of this incident but the food and service also.  Worst part is there wasn't even anybody to complain to or find out what was going on.  I was tempted to call the police, but out of sheer luck was able to resolve the issue on my own outside of the restaurant.  Will not recommend this location to anyone, as the wait here was horrendous (and got even worse after we arrived) and service / food just as questionable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=200,3.32,2.98,2.948,2.3120000000000003,3.116

We arrived at 6:30 and he let them know we were there... we got called up at 7:15 and before we got seated someone who looked, but didn't act at all like a manager informed us that we had a 2 hour time limit from the time of our reservation....wait what? first of all....why were we not told about a time limit when we made the reservation? second of all.. from the time of our reservation? which was 7 and we were there but you didn't even call us up until 7:15...but you're timing us from 7? that's insane.

During happy hour you get a dollar off beer, great deals on appetizers and cocktails (during evening hours I think 9-close/ and during football games) I usually just dine on appetizers while at the bar. One of my favorites is The great beginnings (an appetizer platter) if you are looking to try a few of their different appetizers I would suggest this one. It can easily serve 4 people.

The New York steak was, without exaggeration, smaller than a dollar bill and clearly had been cut down by the chef. It was also a cheap cut, very very dry with a gritty consistency. The ribeye was dry too, even though I asked for it medium. The naan bread was like those refrigerator biscuits you pop open with a knife handle.

This is a great place to grab a bite or a drink before or after a visit to Del Amo Fashion Center. My wife and I have been coming to BJs for lunch or dinner pretty often recently. It had been a while since we had been, but then we had a great time and kept coming back. Usually we will get one of BJs many awesome house beers, the sriracha brussels sprouts, santa fe spring rolls, the ahi poke, and the queso dip. All of these items are delicious and affordable. We often aim for happy hour or Tuesdays since it is happy hour all day then. We also love the PB smores pizookie. Talk about a sugar rush. The service is always attentive and friendly, and the restaurant is usually hopping with people.

Got here at 7, mostly everyone orders, 30 minutes later, still no drinks.  (We had a large group have our holiday dinner here tonight, 20 people in total. The waitress has either never served this many people because the service was horrendous, or she was completely overbooked on tables. Either way, terrible and management should be aware.) After 30 minutes of waiting for drinks, mine finally arrived, last. She seemed more concered with pushing ""pre drink orders"" to make sure drinks kept flowing and telling us how wasted she got on fireball the night before. If she spent as much time making sure we had our drinks and our food on time and less time on making friends, this review may have actually been decent.  4 appetizer plates, all cold and disgusting. Nothing else to say about that.  Most entrees came before soups and salads.  She made excuse after excuse instead of just making things happen. They comped some things out, which they should've done if they were reputable.  Still, I will never ever eat here again.

242,Mike B.,"Torrance, CA",1,6,2.0,1.0,2015-12-27,"This one star review is very generous. We had a party of 6 adults and 1 toddler. The wait quoted was reasonable, but they went 35 minutes past the estimated time because there was a specific area / table they wanted to seat is at. That's ridiculous. There were other tables free and clear that would have accommodated our group.  Our waitress started us off nice but had to leave for an ""emergency"". We were fine with switching service staff, but the new staff did nothing to make us feel comfortable.  I was never offered another beer nor were any of the water glasses refilled (and that was all a couple of adults ordered to drink).  When it was time to pay, the waiter skipped by us and didn't pick up the bill.  It was 40 minutes before our bill was picked up and processed for signature, that included waiting on a pizookie to-go. I can't believe the manager didn't catch all that was not happening with our group. It was like we were invisible to the service staff.  We definitely didn't feel welcome here and we won't be coming back.   You might expect poor service towards a rowdy group (which doesn't make it acceptable), but we were calm, lo-key, adults and there were only 2 alcoholic drinks on our table. I know serving others can be difficult, but not serving is unacceptable.   A big ""thank you"" should be given to the family sitting in the booth across from us. They shared their ketchup bottle with us because we couldn't get a service member to bring 1 for our table (isn't ketchup standard with burger and fries?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=280,2.72,2.88,2.916,2.6600000000000006,2.8160000000000003

116,Steve N.,"Torrance, CA",955,942,1365.0,4.0,2015-12-31,"BJ's is always a nice place to stop in while walking through the Del Amo Mall in Torrance. There are definitely many options to choose from as you're walking through the outside area, but BJ's won't disappoint! You have your choice of sitting outside on the patio or inside where there are several booths and small seats in their bar area. This location is along the Del Amo mall on the Carson side right across from the Vegas seafood buffet. The wife and I come here at night after work to order some food and a flight of beers. If you like deep dish style pizzas, they serve a variety of different pizzas with sizes and toppings of your choice. The one thing I do suggest is to save some room for dessert, as they serve a warm cookie pizza (what they deem a ""pizookie"") with a scoop of vanilla/chocolate ice cream.

104,Scott S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",706,555,1887.0,3.0,2016-01-03,"The review I would give this restaurant is pretty much the same review that I would give to any BJ's location around the L.A., OC area. It is a large, well-designed space made up of a lot of booths and some tables. The food is as expected -- just like all the other BJ's. It is pizza based restaurant and is pretty good. In fact, I'm am a big fan of the various pizzas at BJ's. They do have other offerings but pizza is their primary focus and it has been my experience that is always the best choice when you eat here. They also have a nice selection of beers which, of course, go well with pizza.  As is the case with all BJ's the staff here is nice and friendly. How good your service will be is highly dependent upon who your server is.  Just like all the other BJ's this place can get very-very crowded.  When it is, expect a very loud and chaotic atmosphere. So, the best time to go is on the off hours.  In terms of food, this location offers a breakfast menu. The breakfast dishes are mostly pizza styled entrees. Which is the best way to go. They do have traditional Americana style breakfast; i.e.: eggs, bacon, and pancakes, but the one time I ordered this, my eggs arrived supremely cold. Not good! So, my suggestion is to stay with what BJ's does best, pizza style food.  This BJ's is right off of two large outdoor parking lots in the outdoor section of the Del Amo Fashions Center, so though these too can get full and crowded, parking is generally not too much of an issue.  Overall, BJ's is BJ's, eat here if you want some good pizza and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=60,2.84,2.86,2.956,2.8280000000000003,2.852

I had left my brand new drivers license at home by mistake, but had my old one on me. I showed it, it clearly verified my age. That's the only purpose of checking the ID and trusted at 36 there's no way I look under age in any way. When the waitress told me ""I can't take this"" with no further explanation my younger sister, who was with me insisted she check with the manager. This was even more upsetting. The manager, Scott Montero, refused to come over and speak with me. So I suppose that he looked at the 3 minorities at the table and assumed we'd be trouble, wussed-out and sent the waitress back to us without any reason just ""no."" From that time on I guess the waitress was scared or something, so she wouldn't come over to deliver any of our food, she sent someone else to bring our appetizers and to refill our water. Her service was terrible. But, but when it came time to pay they accepted my credit card. So a 2 month expired Driver's License is not acceptable to purchase a lousy sangria, the most light-weight drink on the menu, but it is ok for a credit card purchase. Because I'm obviously an under age criminal trying to score drinks at stupid BJ's in Torrance...(I hope you can detect the sarcasm) I don't curse but ""F"" you Scott Montero and both waitresses involved that day!

I had a movie to catch later that night so we got here about 2.5 hours early. There were lots of restaurant to choose from but I decided to go to bjs because I had only been once before for a work party and wanted to give it a shot. We were quoted a 25 min wait time and I guess they just call out your name which is a very stupid system, anyways 25 mins goes by and we check in with the hostess who then tells us it's actually going to be an additional 25-30mins. It was annoying but I know that kind of thing can happen so we waited and finally got shown to our table where our server stops by to tell us she will be with us shortly. About 5 mins goes by and she comes back to first check in with her other tables and offer desserts before even taking our drink order. After she finished with everyone else she finally came by to take our order. The salad I ordered came out before our 2 waters did which is ridiculous. After I finish my salad the drinks then come out and then our food. My bf got the chicken club sandwich and I tried a bite. In that one bite I got something that may have been a chicken bone stuck in the roof on my mouth causing it to bleed and it was really painful and hard to get out. At this point I'm pissed but decide to not say anything to management because I was in a rush and just didn't want to deal with it. Jasmine then took over while our server was on break and I really appreciated her sincerity on how slow the service was that night, she was really sweet and at least explained to us that things were running a little bit behind that night without us even complaining or anything. By the time we needed our check our server seemed really busy so we asked another server who told us he couldn't help us and to ask our server to get it... I then saw the manager and called him over for our check. He was nice but didn't ask how everything was or anything which I feel like is a managers responsibility. All around a terrible experience. No teamwork in the restaurant, felt like we were the last priority, got hurt, and had a terrible time. Complete waste of money coming here. Very unprofessional on all parts.

278,Anne B.,"Torrance, CA",6,38,16.0,3.0,2016-03-04,"In moments like these, I really wish I would leave half star reviews. (3.5 stars) Anyways, I've been here multiple times, usually for birthdays or dinner after a movie. I've noticed that every time I come here the prices keep getting higher. A large pizza is $26 now and the big pizookie platter is $22 now. I miss the days before price hikes... The wait time will be at least 30 minutes on a Friday night, but today the buzzer they gave us was really odd. It went off so my party went up to get our table, but then they said that it was an accident. So they gave us a new buzzer (which we later found out didn't work) and they ended up just calling us up since our buzzer wasn't buzzing. So when we went up to finally be seating they told us the table wasn't clean yet.. Then why did they even call us?! Besides the odd beginning, our server was very attentive and friendly.. even though he forgot to even tell us his name lol. As for the food, the pizza is usually good! We had the deep dish BBQ chicken today and it was pretty good but could have used more BBQ and could have been cooked a bit longer because it was a bit soggy. Their menu is very extensive with everything from burgers to pasta to salads to sandwiches to fish and tacos... you name it. But you can never go to BJ's without getting a pizookie (the only thing that makes me come back here)! The cookies and cream flavor is my personal favorite, it's a chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream and an Oreo mousse. There are also a few other desserts on the menu, the strawberry beignet looked really good as well! Overall, it's a very busy and loud place, but it works for a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=320,3.12,3.04,3.008,2.348,3.0720000000000005

616,Crystal D.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",107,6,,1.0,2016-03-06,"Where to begin..first we were told two days ago that we can't make a reservation for a party of 5 but to call ahead on that same day..fine I called and let the hostess know that it's was for 5, 4 adult and a baby and that we needed a high chair. We got there and checked in and waited about 15 minutes or so even though they said 10 which is fine but then they ended up taking us to an elevated booth..I told the hostess that I let them know I needed a high chair prior to arrival..it was ok because they had another booth almost ready for us. We got sat with menus and no utensils. Sat there for about 10-15 minutes before waitress came to take our drink orders. Interestingly enough she made sure to stop by and pick up the previous check book right away but never said hi or I'll be right with you..we order a pitcher of beer and two glasses of wine and also my 16 month olds meal and or appetizers. Drinks took forever to come as she said she was waiting for the bartenders. Servers name I believe was Ginger. Well drink orders finally came but only wine and the glasses of water that my in laws asked for with their wine. Still no beer..few minutes later we got the beer then the appetizers..got the fried calamari which was just ok and the sliders appetizers..well we all were surprised when there was only two sliders and the menu said 4. So the server finally came back and we told her we thought the sliders came with four and her response was ""oh I'm not sure if it does..let me check for you"" already bad that the server doesn't even know the menu..but also I asked where my baby's dinner was. She said ""oh yes"" basically saying she forgot.. In between that my father in law ordered a soup for his dinner and it came out right after the appetizer with not even enough time to take a bite of the apps. She ""found out"" about the sliders and said "" oh I'm sorry the kitchen accidentally sent out a kids meal sliders and that they will get our other two out right away."" Well a few minutes later my babies food came out and then shortly after our dinners came out. Followed by the dinners the other two cheeseburger sliders came out but without cheese or lettuce or tomato or the pickles it was supposed to come with..server didn't come to check how everything was but to just introduce her co worker because she was going on break..new server asked if we were plans my in law asked for the cheese and tomatoes and lettuce that was supposed to come with the sliders..he quickly said ok and they proceeded to be next tables to introduce still almost done with most of our food the slice of cheese and piece of lettuce arrived nothing else and he just dropped it then left. No pickles, no tomatoes and not a word. Well the baby was already getting restless as her food was late and she was just getting tired so we were waiting forever for any plates to be cleared and asked for boxes..when we asked for 2 boxes still none of the plates were cleared and we waited almost 15 minutes for boxes..but it made sure to drop the check as soon as he brought them over and never asked if we wanted anything else dessert or anything mind you it was my boyfriends birthday dinner..well my father in law was already upset as were we and he just put the card in and my mother in law actually had to place it in the servers hand as he was walking by or who knows how long we would've had to wait to get it processed..when he brought it back I decided to look over the bill to see if I could find out what really happened as I am a PIC at a restaurant.. Basically a manager. Didn't see much on the check but the fact that we were charged for the cheese even though it was supposed to be included with our sliders..as we were leaving my in laws decided that they wanted to speak to manager because of all the terrible service and the extra charge and the fact that no one stopped by our table after the slider incident..well we were up front waiting to speak to a manager and about 10 minutes later both managers are at the hostess desk and the hostesses tell the woman manager that we would like to speak to them and the. She proceeded to get this nasty look on her face and rolled her eyes as she walked up to my in laws..unaware that I could see her face before she walked up to them as we were standing separately because of the stairs..sad that all around nothing was done but an insincere apology.. Terrible experience and sad that we came for a birthday celebration..you should really work on customer service and make sure there is teamwork and managers need to stop by every table no matter what but especially if there was an issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=620,3.16,3.04,3.008,2.02,3.0880000000000005

This past visit, on a Friday night, was below adequate. The wait was about 45 minutes for 8 people at 6. They had a malfunction with their buzzers, so we ended up waiting about 10 more minutes than we should have. Our service was below average as well. The waiter did not even introduce himself, and he didn't know the prices on some of the items. He was slow with water refills, which left us thirsty for portions of the meal. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip which was just adequate. It lacked any real flavor. My meal was $11.25, while others were on the higher side. It seems as if every time I come here the prices rise. I came here for a birthday, and they didn't even sing happy birthday to my friend on her 18th birthday. We did order a huge pizzookie platter which was delicious.

Flavors were good. Ingredients weren't soggy. The pieces of chicken were huge. About the size of the square outlet piece of an iPhone charger. Pretty basic salad but was satisfying.

529,Michelle G.,"San Pedro, CA",36,8,15.0,1.0,2016-03-14,"I booked my daughter's first birthday party here back in January for Sunday, March 13. I was told I was the only reservation for 30 for that date, so I would be given the larger outdoor patio. Sold! We were thrilled BJ'S at Del Amo could accommodate. The manager I set things up with, Scott, helped me tour the space and assisted in setting up the most expensive buffet menu for my party of 30. We would be paying close to $30 per person with the extras I requested.  On my way to my party on Sunday at 2:09pm, I was called by the manager on duty that day, Jennifer, who told me that ""instead of the patio your party will be seated inside."" This. Was. Just. The. Beginning.  The girls working at the front desk all need new jobs. My background is in organizational leadership and I train people, much like these employees, how to properly treat customers like they actually mean something to a business. **I have never seen or experienced such attitude from girls at the hostess position** every single one of them working at that location on 3/13/16 from 2-4pm needs to be addressed.  They all wore the ugliest, sour faces, and each one had an attitude to match. The receptionist at 2pm was rude to my sister when she asked about my reservation. They were rude to me when I asked for a glass of water for my thirsty baby. They were rude to my husband when he asked about what the heck happened to our private patio. They were rude to my mother in law when she arrived to the mess of my daughter's first birthday party and began speaking to her like she could not speak English. Fired. The manager straight out lied to my face when I asked what happened to my reserved patio. She told me that ""99% of the time, large parties are specifically assigned the large patio. Your party is just the 1%."" She went on saying that Scott had not told her my party would be on the patio. But over the phone, at 2:09pm, she told me my party would be moving from outside to the inside dining room. Sounds like she did have an idea after all and was trying to cover up their mistake... I spoke with Scott on Friday, 3/11/15 around 12:30pm to finalize my buffet menu. He assured me everything will be taken care of. Come Sunday, minutes before party guests arrive, a large party is seated where my party is supposed to be. They did not have a reservation.  The staff was making a long table for my party in the main dining room, an experience that is completely not what I signed up for. Luckily, there was a smaller patio that was clearing up that could kind of accommodate my needs. Even still, the staff that was helping clean and set up the area gave us attitude when he was WIPING DOWN THE TABLES. Unacceptable. YOUR COMPANY IS THE ONE THAT SCREWED UP. My other kids had to sit outside with my sister at a separate table because they could not all fit in the space, missing out on the party. The ONLY good thing about our experience at BJ's on the day of my event was our server. I forgot his name because he obviously didn't piss me off. He made sure my party had everything we needed.  When you don't put proper customer service training as a high standard, it shows in every element of your business. You need someone to go in and completely retrain your staff on how to treat paying customers with respect.  At the end of the day, the world kept turning, but I will not be returning to this BJ's. I don't want to relive the stress of my baby's 1st birthday. Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=160,2.96,2.95,2.992,2.244,2.9539999999999997

119,Jayson M.,"Hawthorne, CA",392,90,82.0,1.0,2016-05-23,"Came here for a late night snack since I just landed back from a long flight. Called at 11 regarding last calls which was 5 minutes before closing time. The employee on the phone was nice and she seemed well informed of their policy. Got there around 1115ish and asked for a table of two after waiting about 5 mins for someone to approach us. A man and woman walked up and told us the bar area was open, but we didn't want to sit at the bar so we asked if we can sit at a table. He then ignored our request and said the bar area is open? My friend and I was confused. We told them we called earlier. The guy proceeded to tell us the dining area is closed at 11, and the bar area is only open up until last call. Then he looked at the girl and they started to whisper something to each other and the girl looked confused. It was pretty awkward for us standing there while they whispered to eachother. I feel like the girl wanted to seat us in the dining area, but the guy didn't. I didn't want to make it a bigger issue than it was so I just decided to sit at the bar area to find an open table and to our convenience, all the tables were dirty, but he called someone over to clean it pretty quickly. seated and ordered right away with Raymond. He didn't seem too enthusiastic while taking us. We got the two for $25 deal which consisted of a pizza, pizookie, and soup or salad for us both. We asked to just make everything at the same time and just to bring out whatever came out first because we knew it was late. Raymond didn't really understand and kind of gave an attitude saying ""can I bring out the soup and salad first?"" And I kept repeating myself and he kept repeating himself lol. After the whole ordeal he understood. I just didn't want him to wait on us finishing our pizza to start making the pizookie since it was already 1130 and they close at 12.  Everything was fine except my Caesar salad. It was funny because there was literally only ONE crouton on my salad. (Refer to my picture) I was literally so baffled at how there can only be ONE crouton. And this was literally the cherry on top of everything that has unfolded so far. I was discouraged to eat it, but I just landed from a long flight and just ignored it. I was going to ask for some more croutons, but no one came around until the pizza and pizookie came out which came out at the same time which was perfect. At this point I just wanted to get out of there which I asked for the check when the pizza came. I paid right away, and tipped 40% of the bill just for my memorable bad experience.  Raymond peeped the tip amount after returning with a Togo box for the pizza. We could tell his mood changed and seemed a little more happy to serve us which he then offered another refill of lemonade lol. Don't wanna get into that. But yea left the establishment and looked around to see that we were not the last customer there. Yay. ANYWAYS! I wanted to inquire to management about what their policy was regarding their dining area hours for future reference, but I came to a conclusion that I just shouldn't come anymore. I was a server part time and understood everything that was going on. I would never treat customers any different even if they came in one minute before last calls.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to give this restaurant a chance after the first and second time, but this is the final straw.  The first time I went here, my food took forever and when I finally received my pasta, it was so cold I didn't even eat it. The second time, service took forever as well (and no the restaurant was not busy). Finally, this 3rd and final time was he absolute worst.  At first we thought it would be a good time, and our appetizers rolled out quick but they tasted really shitty. The calamari was a little cold and the avocado egg rolls tasted sour. Then we put in an order for food at 10pm. Then 10:45 rolled around and we still haven't received our food. The two girls sitting next to us ordered two small pazookies the same time we placed our orders and they haven't received their food either. They began to get frustrated just as us. Once they noticed how pissed we were, they began to try to help us. So they brought out our two padinas but they didn't bring out fries with it because it wasn't ready for some reason. I mean, how long does it take to make fries??  Not to mention they didn't even bring out the pizza yet.  It was so bad that I will never come here again nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. I will actually tell everyone I know to not go here.

Today I tried something different: SEARED AHI SALAD: Baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avacado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions tossed with rice wine vinaigrette - I was quite impressed with their salad. The dressing was good and the seared ahi was okay too. But the salad's around $15 and I don't usually spend that much on salad. (The only reason why I tried it this time was because I had a BOGO entree coupon.) DEEP DISH ZITI: Penne layered with housemade meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, Marinara and Italian herbs, finished with BJ's signature five cheese blend. Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. - Very cheesy, the way I like it. But not something I would want to pay $15 for again. The waitress today was very friendly. I was ready to leave great reviews about their service, but everything was TOO SLOW! It was lunch time, meaning, there are a good number of customers but the seats are not filled.

WHAT? How can you advertise curbside? Decided to pull up in red zone, called the restaurant to discover they had no record of my order... Even though I had an email confirmation. I gave them the conf#, only to find out they can't use the number to pull up the order. That makes no sense! So, after listening to the Manager blame technology or operator error (me) I said clearly the error is not mine.. I have the conf#.  She offered to expedite my order so I placed the order for the deep dish my son wanted and one of their famous root beers. I live 20 minutes away and was only there bc my son really wanted BJs.  She then told me there are 3 designated parking spots in the lot (NOT curbside), when I kindly told her there are cars parked that haven't moved in the now 10 minutes, she told me to pull into the red zone. Hmmmm I waited and waited. Observed that the 3 spots never turned over AND a delivery man came out and hopped in his car, which was parked in a handicap space. SHAME ON HIM! I guess he felt his time was more important than someone's need for handicap parking.  Finally, 40 minutes After I first arrived, my pizza was brought out to me. I asked about the root beer and she told me they were out. WHAt? Why didn't they tell me that on the phone as I idled in the red zone? Their housemade root beer is delicious... How could they be out at 6:44 on a Saturday night? At last, I paid my bill before I lost my cool. NO concession was made for my lost order, the 40 EXTRA minutes I had to wait or for the lack of root beer. No discount, no coupon, no here's a free cookie.... NOTHING!  Why do you offer online ordering if it doesn't work? Why do you offer curbside when there is no such thing available? And why would you make a gesture that my time mattered and you want me to return some day. Btw, if someone orders something on the phone and you are out? TELL THEM... Don't wait til the very end.

I walked in and was not greeted by anyone, I had to approach someone to be seated. but because I asked about happy hour they pointed me to the bar area, so I walked over there.

I asked about happy hour again because I was unsure of it and she said no because it starts at 10, and its been 10 LOL. She told me its half off appetizers and pizza. So I order 2 appetizers to go. I got my bill and put my card in the cup. When I got the receipt back to sign and tip it was more than what I was expected.

I was welcomed by a lady in the front who informed me that half my party had to be present before we actually got seated. Unfortunately the lady who actually seated us looked and sounded less than happy to do so. But it was okay, fortunately our server for that night, Jeremiah, was great. He was super friendly and I felt very comfortable around him. (4 stars) I ordered the siracha and queso dip and chips as an appetizer for me and my friends. The chips were good, nothing amazing. However the dip was disappointing because it merely seemed like melted cheese with a bit of green onions mixed in. There was no siracha!  (2 stars) As for the food, I ordered a seared ahi salad. The ahi was clearly not seasoned well enough and it lacked flavor. Also, only a third of my plate was lined with ahi and I really wish I got more (2 stars). The avocado in the salad was a good balance to the very acidic, and probably too acidic, greens and dressing (3 stars). In conclusion the food was average, nothing too special. I did however enjoy my server very much which was probably the only reason I'm giving the place a 3 star.

Sat at curbside calling the number on the sign repeatedly. After about ten minutes, I remembered I had the app and ordered online.

Explained to Kiana that I had been sitting outside for the second time and no one was picking up the curbside line. This b**ch pauses for a minute then tells me it's probably because the other girl was making food in the back. Really smart ass?! If so, it's sad to say that there's ONE person making food, bringing it to cars, and answering the phone!! Luckily, the baby was in the car asleep because I would've been inside ready to snatch her up!  Anyhow, I got my cookie. The young lady was nice when she came out.

My boyfriend & I were told it will be a 15 minute wait for a table so we waited. When the time came, we head to be seated until the lady seating us, told us to stop because our table wasn't ready because it was still dirty, she then just headed to the front as if nothing happened. The lady just left us mid aisle with no instructions except for ""stop"" so what were we suppose to do when our table was still dirty & we were just standing there? My feet were killing me from shopping all day so I sat down. We waited a good 10 minutes at the dirty table until the manager noticed all the dishes to the side and it was just my boyfriend & I talking. She then got a bit mad and asked us what happened. As we tried to explain our story, she said to point out the lady who seated us so she can tell her what she did wrong and how she could fix it. We looked after the manager left as she approached the lady who had seated us and she acted as if she did not know what we were taking about. As if we seated ourselves. Let me remind you I waited that 15 minutes to be seated! The manager then came back & asked if we seated ourselves but we tried explaining the lady just left us with a dirty table. The manager YET did not really believe us and told us it was ""okay if you seated yourself"" but we DID NOT. I was so disappointed at how the lady acted as if she did not even know who we were and how she ""did not"" seat us. I was left speechless. Later, our waiter brought us our drinks which were the wrong ones but we did not say anything. He later went home & introduced us to a new waiter who then forgot to put our discount TWICE on our check.

Funny thing was, I kept seeing her over the next 30 minutes on the floor. They dropped off appetizer and never came back to check if I needed anything. They never checked on our drinks.

After he took our drinks he came back and asked what I would like to order and I said I'd like to get the deep dish 'Great White' pizza and then he responds by saying ""You're so racist"" and my thought was like okay thats not really funny because clearly I'm a Hispanic female and you're African American and I know what racism feels like. But I just did a fake laugh and let it go. But then Mr. Duane comes out with my pizza and says to me in front of my friend ""Here's the pizza for the Trump supporter"" and walks away. Wow! I could not believe that came out of his mouth! how offensive is that to say to someone? Especially because I don't even know this guy, who made this guy a waiter?!

We give the plate back asking for new ones and yet we received no apologies and she just says ""ok"" and walks away. Our appetizer, fried calamari, first comes out. But it isn't hot. It's room temperature with a few calamari just in our dipping sauce. Then, Our pizza comes out. But once again it isn't hot, it's room temperature and the pizza wasn't cut so my friend and I struggled to cut through the cooled down pizza.

My daughter got the Golden Beet and Arugula salad.  She loved the freshness and quality of the salad.  My wife usually orders that salad and loves it too. My wife and I shared the Garlic Chicken and Pesto Tavern Cut pizza.  I was disappointed in the pizza because only two slices (the ones in the middle) had any sort of toppings and freshness to them.  The rest of the slices were dry and minimal toppings.  The crust was dry and crunchy which was not tasty.  I prefer thin crust to thick crust when it comes to pizza but when you order these tavern cut pizzas it seems like you will only get two slices of pizza that have the toppings on them and can actually enjoy. The service was a bit slow too.  When we sat down in the bar area it took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and ask if we wanted anything.   Love the bar area.  Plenty of tv's with different college football games on.  That was enjoyable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=60,2.12,2.59,2.812,2.284,2.402

(Reservations are for larger parties, but they will ""put your name down"" if you call ahead of time). On the plus side you can order drinks at the bar while you wait and they have some booths to sit at around the entrance. You should expect a dimly lit bustling atmosphere with the occasional slow service, but at least you have lots of time to find what you want through their delicious menu items. [   ]  BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza: $26.50 5/5 Safety Rating I'm pretty open minded when it comes to deep dish and pan crust pizza and I thought this was a pretty safe pick. BJ's Favorite in particular is one of their more popular ones so it must be doing something right. Eat it with people. Maybe 2-5 others to be safe (if you're alone it's okay, you can always take it to go friend). [   ] Brisket Burger: $12.95  4/5 Safety Rating Could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce, but maybe you like it that way. It was as if they reached the perfect ratio of sauce to burger, then passed it by a bit. It was quite filling and made me feel okay about spending $12.95 on it.

Our server was ok; however, our food not so much. We ordered 1 large BBQ chicken pizza and specifically asked for it to be half BBQ / half pepperoni with added pepperoncini's and a salad. We received our food about 20mins later and as I'm eating, there's 2 FREAKING blonde strand of hair in my food (my hair is BLACK)!!!! Grossed out at this point I immediately called the waiter over and showed him what I had found, he took the pizza back and thinking about it I don't recall him ever apologizing for it. Before walking off our server did informed us he would be going on break and another person would be waiting on us. While waiting for our food, this time it took much longer than before, I would've thought since the mistake was on THEIR end they'd rush the order but apparently not.   Our food finally comes out and the order is not the same as our initial order PLUS the pizza looked DRY!! Dry meaning as if it had been sitting back there for a while, which could of happened because like I said, this time it did take much longer for us to get our food! Upon our food arrive we expected to receive our the same order we initially order the first time; however, we RECEIVED a full BBQ chicken pizza with NO pepperoncini's! At this point we were annoyed, irritated and a bit impatient with your staff. What was supposed to be 30min lunch had taken well over an hour; our plans were to catch a movie afterwards but due to the screw ups and waiting games WE MISSED OUR MOVIE!  I did mention to our waitress that our order was incorrect BUT I told her we weren't looking to be here any longer then we had too, so we ended up keeping the order! The mix up and screw ups was just horrible and unfortunately this wasn't the end.  Lastly, we ordered a Pizookie and I specially asked for half chocolate chip and half Oreo.. They still couldn't get it right!!! We received a half WHITE chocolate and Oreo instead of WHAT I ASKED FOR!!! I just couldn't take anymore and was so over it, the miscommunication was beyond me.

This is the second time I have dined at this specific location; the first time being an OK experience with long wait times for our food in a low peak hour.  The second time being an awful experience. We had a server who was new, which we were completely understanding. However, we waited about 30 minutes for food at 10 p.m on a wed night. Prior to ordering our food we asked if there was happy hour and were told no. Found out aftermath that that was a lie. After the 30 minute wait, our server told us our food had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes for a to-go order. Our food had to be remade again. Once we got our food, there was hair in it. Two hairs to be precise. Called the manager and the manager comped one of the meals but not the whole dinner. This could have been dealt with differently but we appreciated what we got.  I ordered the fish tacos and she offered to make me another fish taco to go. I accepted and not took an additional 20 minutes. The manager actually came back to our table to ask if that fish taco arrived and we smiled and Shook our heads. She didn't brought it out herself. Long story short, the way that BJ's has been to us the couple times we have been to the specific location we will not be back. The service is terrible. Food was good, just like the hair.

You get to select 3 flavors from their selection (salt caramel, chocolate chunk, peanut butter smores, etc) and comes in a fairly decent size for the price. However, the cookie was too sweet and the texture wasn't consistent. Some parts of the cookie were hard and some were gooey. In addition, table service wasn't on par for what we paid at the restaurant. The waiter rarely comes by and never checked in on us to see how we were doing. When we asked for our check, the waiter just gave us a crumpled receipt from his pocket (no folder to put in cash/credit card what so ever). At the end of our stay we had to stand up and go to the cashier to pay for our dessert.

The food didn't taste so good to me there. So I said to myself, maybe I'll go to my local one here at Del Amo mall and maybe the food will taste better when I'm well rested and relaxed and in a happy mood. So I went with my parents and other family members that Xmas and the food was the same--average and especially over-priced. I ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was almost $34 dollars!!!! And it wasn't even good, it was like those horrible pan pizzas you get at Pizza Hut. It didn't even look like a large, it looked like a medium. I can get a better pizza and large too with 3 toppings at Domino's for $8 only and only 2 bucks for extra toppings. At this horrible restaurant, only cheese is free and anything above it is almost $5 for extra toppings.

Hubbers got his brewski as well (forgot what he got.)  Whoa, their food menu is extensive! It took us a few minutes to read through everything!  We agreed to start our meals with their honey sriracha Brussel sprouts and spinach stuffed mushrooms.  The only teenee issue I have with the Brussel sprouts, really, is that a couple of them weren't cooked through - still edible, though. The honey sriracha wasn't overpowering and the seasoning was nearly perfect. I didn't really get a good taste of the spinach with the mushrooms. The pesto sauce came off a bit strong but didn't really do any overpowering. We really liked this also.  I had the lunch portion spaghetti and meatballs while Hubbers got the fish and chips with the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  The spaghetti and meatballs were nothing to scream about. It was average, the typical spaghetti you get from mediocre Italian restaurants. I should have asked for fresh grated mozzarella and black pepper because that might have made a difference. It was okay, though.  Hubbers enjoyed his fish and chips. The salad is pretty much a caprese. We shared it and the key to that entire thing was the balsamic vinegar dressing. I could have had that as a meal!  Service was above mediocre level. Nothing to complain about on that department.  We noticed their ""MOVIE AND A MEAL"" ad.

I'm not asking for my food to be piping hot. But it'd be nice to be able to eat the food while it's somewhat hot. The server sucked as well. He never checked to see how the food was.

They have a Thursday special for $18.95 for a full rack of ribs. It includes a salad, two sides and a mini pizookie for desert.  There was plenty of food for two of us.  We selected a baked potato and asparagus for the sides.  Even the baked potato was delicious.  It tasted fresh-baked and creamy, and it was large.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection.  For our salad, we chose the house salad with a very flavorful strawberry vinaigrette.  There are other salads to chose from.  For our mini pizookie, we selected the chocolate chunk pizookie with chocolate chip ice cream.  OMG!!  So good. I had a pizookie at BJ's for the first time a couple days ago, but this was my first full meal there.

The waiter came a few minutes after we were seated and asked if we wanted something to drink. We said yes, my wife ordered Diet Coke and I ordered flavored ice tea. My wife then said the waiter, ""we're here for the prime rib special"". Is it still available? His reply was "" I'm not sure, I'll go ask"". He then left. After about 10mins, he returned but not to inform us about the availability, but to get the order from the table next to us. I assumed he would tell us after he took their order but that didn't happen. He just went back. Wow, no drink and no update. After another 10min, he returned and asked us if we had decided on what we wanted for drinks? REALLY? You took 20mins to forget our drinks and NOT to let us know if the prime rib is still available?!!!

The topper was for desert we ordered the mini pizzookie  since we accumulated enough points for a free one. He said great and took off. 10 mins later he came back and asked,"" Do you guys leave enough room for some desert?"" Are you kidding me???? You totally forgot we ordered a mini pizzookie? Oh yea.

132,Ms. B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,3.0,1.0,2017-04-29,It's upsetting when you see employees on their phones and not seating when there's a full lobby and empty tables. They past my quote time and I even reserved a table online. I finally get seated I didn't get serviced until 15 mins later. I finally got my food ordered and my entrees came out first before my appetizers. I asked the waitress how come my entrees came out first. She checks in the kitchen and comes out 7 mins later our appetizers. She apologized but then when we ate the food it was broader line warm to cold. It's just disappointing when they have this much staff and they are delivering cold food to paying customers when it expected to be hot. Later one of the food runner drops over calm Chowder at our table and we didn't even order it. The management really needs to train their employees getting wrong tables. They probably gave my food to another table. This is by far the worse I've experienced at the establishment. I came here for the pizookie but I feared by the time it came to me the ice cream would have melted or I would get it when the store closed. My advice don't come here during rushes. The waitress tried to fix it by comping out appetizers which I appreciated but then when our bill came there was added stuff. I told the waitress this was not what we ordered and again she apologized and gave us the correct bill. When we paid she came and apologized again and rang up the wrong table.

The wait was about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, very clean and there are tables for large and small parties.  The restaurant is not well lit so I had problems reading the menu.  Increasing the lighting would be beneficial for many.   Food: I decided to order the gluten free pizza. It was difficult because there was so much on the menu to choose from.  One family member ordered the bbq wings and the other ordered the deep dish pizza.  The pizza was excellent, the crust was thin and the cheese tasted great.   Service: Our server was extremely nice and very attentive.  He made sure our drinks were filled and made recommendations since it was my first time visiting.   Overall the food was good.  I will visit again during my next trip to LA.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=20,2.68,2.58,2.78,2.6399999999999997,2.62

Everything started off very positive. Once we were seated our waitress came to the table to take our orders and she was very dry and didn't appear to be very friendly. Still not a problem. Once we were done placing orders the waitress whose name is Toni snatched the menu out of my hand. I still didn't stay anything. Once our appetizers was served Toni brought a new waitress over by the name of Anissa and said she was going on break. She was wonderful and turned the experience around quickly. I watched Toni serve food to other table, but she was supposed to be on a break. I thought it was odd. At some point she did eventually go on a break. Once her break ended she never came back to our table. I watched how interacted with her other tables. She was very friendly with her customers and each time that she passed our table she gave us nasty looks. Once our check came we paid our bill and tipped Anissa. We thanked Anissa for her wonderful service. Before we left the restaurant we decided to speak with the manager to let her know about Toni's behavior. We spoke with Christina and she assured that she would talk to her. We were still finishing dessert when Toni walked past our table and called us B*****s. I had to make sure that I wasn't imagining things. I wasn't because 4 other people saw the same thing including my 11 year old. I said someone better go get the manager because we are about to have a serious issue. Toni walked passed our table again and flipped the bird to us. Again we have our children present who is witnessing this behavior. I completely lost my cool and was about to flip over the entire table because at this point I am livid. Christina the manager walks over to my table and I explain what has happened. I can tell that she was not pleased to hear what her waitress has done. Christina then went to talk to Toni and she stormed out of her job. Christina gave me a courtesy card to come in for another visit in addition to giving me information for the GM of that location. Christina was very professional and I appreciate her hospitality and trying to rectify the issue at hand. I am never the type to mess with anyone's livelihood, but that was just ridiculous.

This restaurant is a brewery too that's one of the reasons we love to frequent this place, I love their handcrafted brews like berry cider, piranha, Jeremiah red and stout. Also the Chicago style deep dish pizzas are just too delicious and they even have gluten free choices. Extensive menus with yummy small plates and light items are perfect for light meals, pizzas, burgers and wings are great for watching sports. Other favorites are Sriracha brussel sprouts, tuna poke, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, jumbo spaghetti with meatballs, jambalaya and super salad with blackened salmon. They have Happy hour Monday - Friday from 3-7pm, Sunday- Thursday from 10- close at bar dining area, Tuesdays half off wines on glasses and bottles. Don't forget about the pizookies that's one of the best desserts out there. And they make very strong and refreshing Grey Goose martinis that I love to have as my non sweet ""desserts""!  Absolutely our favorite go to chain restaurant in the neighborhood, can't beat the food and drinks at both prices and portions! They sell their own canned brews at the restaurant ""to go"" area that we like to grab a few to take home after our meals here or whenever we do take outs, it's quite convenient for a beer lover like me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance,2.64,2.68,2.736,2.612,2.664

I could see the manager of the restaurant holding court across the aisle from me on a table with about 4 servers crowding around her. She seemed to hold up Josh for quite a while and then reminded him to come check all the customers he'd just acquired.  I'm glad that I could see that three-quarters of the meal had already happened when Steven left and I had grabbed a few bucks out of my purse to hand him some cash. All the cash I had was only $3 but I wanted him to not miss out on a tip. After that it took kind of a long time to get my iced tea refilled, get a to go container. and cash out my check.

It's an upscale place for a fair price. My favorite dish is the Lemon Thyme Chicken $12, lunch menu. It comes with brown rice and Brussels sprouts and grilled chicken. Absolutely deelish.

31,Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32.0,1.0,2017-09-22,"Well, unfortunately, BJ's lack of QA has reared its ugly head again.  After experiencing the best experience ever at a BJ's in Montebello, we just experienced one of the worst. The hostesses were pre-occupied with gossip vs. patrons.  We actually stood there and observed two hostesses converse about their private lives while we are literally three feet away wanting to get seated.  Finally, they took notice of a line building up and we finally got seated.  Rule one, keep your personal life at home and do not bring it to work.  Seriously. Once seated we ordered our appetizer.  Needless to say, it was not cooked all the way through.  How can you not cook mushrooms thoroughly.  One of the simplest things to do.  Needless to say, our waitress was clueless when we asked her to take them back for fresh ones and could not understand wy we would want a fresh batch.  I told her, feel it, it is stone cold. Needless to say, we got the good old fashioned roll of the eyes thrown our way.  She did not say a word and took the dish.  Someone else brought out a new dish and no words were spoken.  It was like the show' Westworld'  all robots but these robots are not thinking about the client and the client experience. We got our salads at the same time we got our food when we distinctly asked for the salads before the meal.  Very disappointed as our food was getting stone cold as we had our salads. So, our waitress never came back to give more water or ask if we wanted a refill on our beverages.  AWOL.  All I can say is that the food was not edible as it was stone cold.   We asked them for the Prime Rib sandwich a certain way.  It was not even listened to, as it came the way it would normally.  We waited for the waitress to make the orders right, however, she was staying away at a bigger table and we were just forgotten about in the corner booth. Needless to say, this location failed at all levels.  First impressions were a zero, the waitress was a zero and the food was a zero.  All of this could have easily been avoided if people just did their job.  Nothing fancy, just do your job and who knows how it would have turned out. We wanted to take advantage of Pizookie special, however, our waitress was AWOL and we did not want to waste any more time in a place that did not care about us this day.  Get Montebello to train your staff, Kristian in Montebello knows how to be an AWESOME server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance,2.4,2.65,2.664,2.212,2.55

When I got my burger, besides being cold (if it was taken out at the appropriate time, it would be somewhat warm--we live five minutes away), it was burnt. Charcoal.

They probably could do a better job of making sure their guests are 100% happy with the food and service, before the guests leave the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance,2.72,2.63,2.62,,2.6660000000000004
