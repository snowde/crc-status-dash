I love the chopped salad (I get it with romaine, though ... because I like to tell myself it's more nutritious). The artichoke dip and the pear cider were yum, too. But the portions were smaller than I remembered (it's been awhile so I can't say if it was bad luck or if that's how it is now).

(-) - red velvet pizookie I always wondered why all the other restaurants are so empty for dinner, it's cause everyone is at BJ's! Both times I came here for dinner there were tons of people (but still plenty of tables so no wait) 1st time here I got the Santa Fe salad which was amazing! I was scarred from the shitty salad I got at Chili's so I was expecting the worst but it turned out to be extremely delicious. Everything was fresh and the chicken tasted great, loved the seasoning.  2nd time I got some kind of steak with a side of vegetables. Steak was surprisingly good, and at a decent price. Vegetables tasted slightly undercooked and overly buttery. We also ordered a red velvet pizookie which was a huge disappointment. Definitely not as good as I remember it when I had it a few years ago, did it always taste so cookie dough-y? Would have liked it to be firmer.

My favorite is the Chicken Parmesan. All their appetizers are good. Right now, I'm in love with their wings! I think it was 10 wings for 10 bucks but well worth it.

118,Jean B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,,2.0,2012-08-22,"We ate here on a whim for an early dinner.  I've had BJ's before in another city and it was good.  Unfortunately, today's meal was mediocre at best.  We were seated after a short wait, which wouldn't have been bad, except that there were plenty of open tables.  Our waitress was decent, but not helpful when the food didn't turn out good. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, and the manager even came out and told us he knew it was taking a while, but didn't offer anything to address the issue, such as a small appetizer, salad or even just bread.  Even the kids in the booth behind us, screaming for their food, didn't tip them off that they should do something to help all the customers. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and it was underwhelming.  It had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, the cooked spinach was dried out on top and when I showed it to the waitress, she just brought out a new plate of UNCOOKED spinach.  The pasta was also dried out from sitting too long. My companion ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was fried to the point of being chewy and tough.  The ""white cheddar mashed potatoes"" tasted as if they were made from an instant mix. Finally we ordered a the Red Velvet Pizzookie.  The cookie tasted more like raw cake batter with a few white chocolate chips.  The ice cream was bland.  We ended up not even eating half of it. Despite all the issues with the food, which they were clearly aware of, they didn't offer any discount or compensation, so we ended up paying over $50 for a boring and tasteless dinner.  We will definitely not being coming back here for any meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=140,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.6320000000000006,3.0800000000000005

I'm not really one to try new places but my family can be rather picky so we chose this place because of their huge array of choices. I definitely should have looked at the reviews on here before coming. The waiting time between ordering and receiving food was absolutely, unbelievably bad. After reading the reviews here I guess it must be a common problem but I was astonished it took nearly TWO hours to be seated, order, receive the food and then order and receive a small dessert. There is definitely a huge disconnect between the kitchen and the waiters; although our waiter was very friendly and almost a little too outgoing after the 5th ""Oh, it'll be a few more minutes!"" it gets old. Oh, and sorry BJ's, but  it does NOT take more than half an hour to put two cookies in a metal pan, heat them up, and put some ice cream on top of them. When we had received our food it was sub-par at best; hamburgers and their buns were overcooked, angel hair pasta was a ball of dough (God bless my family who ate it, I tried it and nearly spit it out) because it was overcooked, the chicken burnt in spots, etc. I could go on but I was so disappointed with this place we had to talk to the manager and explain that there really is no excuse for this kind of service. Whatever manager was working that night definitely went out of his way though since he refunded my entire party of six's meals, all drinks, and two appetizers. Because of that I'm bumping this place up to two-stars but honestly it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time.

I honestly haven't any idea if they had to wait as when we arrived they had mostly killed the appetizers. Which, DaFuq is with serving a horseradish sauce with lettuce wraps sure they call it a spicy mustard sauce but who are you fooling it isn't even yellow? There also were some fried artichoke hearts which were good but in the lower third of fried artichoke bits I have managed to shove in my mouth throughout my travels. The sauce was like someone mixed 1 part lemon juice to 2-3 parts ranch... but the super overcooked piece of fried calamari hiding amongst the crispy plant matter was a real wake up to my pallet. Its flavor really complimented its bicycle inner tube-esque texture. Now I will never claim to never eat animal bits but, Jesus Tap Dancing Christ there are only TWO vegetarian options and absolutely no viable vegan options. Your choices are a veggie pizza or some pasta with a very mediocre red sauce.  So I finally decided on a turkey club after I realized everyones hunger filled eyes were digging into me after the 5th lap thru the menu looking for something that I would both  eat and try to enjoy. The turkey club was a middle of the road club sandwich that would have been worse had I not added avocado. There is way too much bacon and turkey to get any kind of balance of flavors. The skinny fries were fine. Special lady friend at least found a scallop tomato asparagus dish that didn't have any red flags of allergy warnings (deathly allergic to quinoa) when it arrived it was fine not horrible not exceptional just fine. However it was along the lines of thats it?. Mom and Dad both got the honey crisp salads, apparently this is their go to dish at this place.

He mentioned it as more of an afterthought to Clinton as he liked the dish it just wasn't very hot. Clinton had the manager come over and between Clinton and the manager they more than made everything right by bringing free dessert to try.

115,Kate H.,"Tucson, AZ",69,10,,5.0,2014-05-17,"Atmosphere: A Food: A Service: A+ This was my family's first time eating at a BJ's.  My 5-year-old got a certificate from his school that was good for a free kid's meal, so we decided to check it out. What other reviewers have said about this being Cheesecake Factory-esque is true, except that it feels a lot more laid back.  The lunch menu looked pretty solid, but we were there on a Saturday, so no lunch for us! My husband and I and our two kids had a great meal.  Service was phenomenal, despite the fact that we were seated next to a large party who arrived just a bit before we did (usually death for service).  For example, my husband got the bottomless homemade root beer but mentioned to the waiter that he'd want a cream soda for the next round.  Fast forward 15 minutes when he was nearing the bottom of his mug, and the waiter brought over a fresh mug and was setting it down on the table pretty much at the exact moment that he finished! Our kids' food arrived a couple of minutes before ours, which I always love.  It wasn't like 5 minutes before, it was really probably about 90 seconds--just enough time to get them both set up with ketchup and get the crayons and kids menus gathered up so that we were ready to dig straight into our food when it arrived.  (Speaking of which--from the time we placed our order to the time the food arrived?  About ten minutes.  Nice work, kitchen!) But the best part was when, near the end of the meal, we presented the manager with our son's coupon.  He (our son) was so darn excited about it, and the manager brought him a little BJ's pin to wear, told him how great it was, and then comp'd not only his meal, but also his brother's, and a dessert for the table!  My son was so proud of himself coming out of that restaurant that he could not stop showing off his new pin the whole drive home.  As we were getting ready to leave, the waiter came back with to-go cups filled with another round of their homemade sodas. The food was yummy, the atmosphere was fun, but the little thoughtful extras like having the manager personally congratulate my son for his big achievement (he's a developmentally delayed child who met several language goals at school this year), the kids' food, the refills, the to-go cups, and comping not just the one kid's meal, but two (plus a dessert!) left me so impressed I pretty much came straight home to crank out this review.  We will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=140,3.32,3.11,3.11,3.0280000000000005,3.194

Their menu is broad and vast.  Some items better than others.  For instance: - The steaks, though slightly salty (which I like) are really decent and lean - The chili, which many people seem to like, I thought could use some spices and more flavor - The bread bowls are a great concept and good value but, again, take some of the salt from the steak and put it in your soups and chili - The homemade sodas are a big hit, I think these are the coolest (literally, served in an icy mug) - The pazookies are tremendous - I think it's worth it just coming for dessert to get a homemade soda and a pazookie The service is a mixed bag.  I've had good 2/3ds of the time, but when it's bad, it is cardboard and forgetful.  When it's good, it is timely and friendly.

BJs isn't the only wide variety of beers on tap and updated sports bar decor, but indeed it is a very conveniently placed restaurant allowing the most food deprived individuals to get their meals and drinks served fast. The down side of 4 stars is my Sriracha chicken mac and cheese didn't pack as much heat as it probably should have, it was lightly portioned for a dinner Hardy meal, and the service was mediocre- but for a fast place to eat at 10pm after a long day BJs is an easy go-to.

Why just the other day I was in the middle of s conversation that had to do with whatever it is I'm ranting about.  And a young woman who I love dearly commented that she'd rather go to a Denny's than Prep and Pastry .  She knows that she will enjoy the American Slam (or whatever) at the former while she just doesn't know what she'll end up with at the latter.  Not her fault.  She will still have a positive dining experience.  But had she driven a little further, waited in line a little longer and taken a chance.....she may have had the meal of her life!

Understaffing...or B.  just not moving people through at the HOST station.  To clarify, I AM TYPICALLY a lay down and VERY patient customer, and having been in the ""biz"" even yesterday I was as well.  We had to seat ourselves, and ASK for a booth to be cleaned.  Then, we sat down, and when the server came over to say hello, the woman I was with asked her to wipe off the table, as the dishes had been removed ONLY.   She ""grumped about it, and came back and wiped it down.  That was the beginning of the end of our experience.  I had to ask about any specials.  Nothing was explained.  She was rude, and paid ZERO attention to us.  We ordered drinks, and 3 appetizers to share as they were HALF OFF due to the NFL game.  That part was AWESOME!  We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls, a Sausage & Cheese Mini deep dish, and the Rootbeer glazed wings.  Wings were good, but WAY overcooked.  I like them crispy, but that should be a question that the servers asks.

Truthfully the driest piece of fish I've had to date. I would've sent it back but I already had to send back one of my drinks. I ordered ""sangria"" without reading the menu and noting that they put fireball and cinnamon stick in theirs' (not a cinnamon fan at all). The bartender was very understanding and I ordered a replacement drink which wasn't great, but it was drinkable.  We finished the meal with a monkey bread pizookie (it was Tuesday so $3 pizookie night) and it was also dry and overcooked. Between the two of us we maybe got half of it down...

Overall I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  Tonight was a miss.  I had tomato bisque, and shrimp  and asparagus penne.  I was pleased that bj's is putting calorie counts on the menu, and then totally puzzled.  A ""bowl"" of soup that's about 10 spoonfuls spread on a shallow plate is 560 calories, while a plate of pasta enough for two, plus a roll, has 730?  Yes, the soup was greasy - in a really, really tasty way, I have to admit -  but if 560 calories is correct, I was basically drinking oil with some tomato sauce mixed in; normal tomato soup is about 150 calories a cup.  That might be right, I could actually see flecks of oil separating from the soup, but I bet it could have been made with a bit more flavor and less fat, for $7 is should have been.  OTOH, the penne was ridiculously under-estimated, there was at least half a pound of pasta on that plate, I'd estimate 1000 calories, maybe more, not including the sauce or the roll.   In addition to being unable to rely on the nutritional information given, the penne was seriously bleh.  It was overcooked, there was a soggy rogue crouton hiding in it, and when I pay $16.50 for a plate of ""shrimp pasta"", I'd like to see more than five. My husband had the ribs and was unimpressed - again, it's hit or miss, the last time they were very good\, this time dry and not meaty.  And his tortilla soup had a big lump of potato in it - not horrible, but not supposed to be there either. Finally, our friends had a coupon for a free meal that the waiter forgot to add in, and it took nearly 20 minutes to get it sorted out and corrected.  My take-away:  don't go on a busy night, don't count on the calorie count, and (from another visit) definitely don't order take-away, the portions are smaller and inconsistent, and the food may be sitting there for hours or not ready when you arrive, regardless of lead time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=40,3.6,3.38,3.38,,3.4680000000000004

Soup came out quickly, but everything else was slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2,3.44,3.34,3.34,,3.3800000000000003
23,Heather L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,3.0,2017-09-07,"Went to eat tonight and had the server Olivia. We ordered three apps only. Apps got delivered by food runners and we continued to not see our server for an actual hour. My friend ran out of tea and when our server came by she grabbed the tea to refill returned and she did not come to check us out the rest of the night. We watched her check out her other two tables on the other side and waved, I ended up having to catch her for our check which also took her another 12 minutes to return to us. The food was great but service was lacking. Disappointing because this was my first time I did not enjoy my entire experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=40,3.44,3.32,3.32,,3.3680000000000003
16,Tammy S.,"Tucson, AZ",4,7,2.0,5.0,2017-09-15,"Amazing service and delicious food. Our waitress, Jade, was spectacular. We asked for a recommendation and, yep, her suggestion of the BBQ brisket burger was spot on. We shared the burger and left full and happy. Personally, we think BJ's has the Tucson Red Robin beat. We will be returning for more of the same soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2,3.52,3.32,3.32,,3.4000000000000004
2,Jamie Y.,"Tucson, AZ",49,58,25.0,5.0,2017-09-24,"Came to BJs for a friend's birthday with a group of 6.  The menu selection is phenomenal and so is the beer!  Tommy was our waiter and he recommended for me to try the Sonoran White Chocolate beer and their Amber. Both were delicious! And Tommy was a great waiter. We ended up calling him Big-T!  Our group was filled with laughter and probably a little noisy. But it was Sunday night football and not very crowded after we arrived.  We got a bunch of appetizers and one giant, deep dish pizza with pepperoni and bacon. Avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, wings, spinach-artichoke dip, and pot stickers. Others also got some soup, tacos, and chili. We were all stuffed. We wanted to make it to dessert but we didn't haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2,3.56,3.32,3.32,,3.4160000000000004
1,Diane P.,"Tucson, AZ",5,13,28.0,1.0,2017-10-24,"I would seriously give the Broadway location a zero if it was possible! We had the worst service and food on a Monday at lunch with friends. The server had no clue that dirty dishes should be cleared when refills of salad and soup were delivered, the glasses of soda were intentionally left at the end of the table and refills were ignored....service was slow and she only had one other table of 5 in our area. If she had other tables on the other side of the restaurant, that is just plain mismanagement. The waitress was annoying on the verge of rude, she corrected my husband several times when he asked questions and had an unpleasant attitude. A few members of our party asked to make slight changes to their orders, apparently that makes their handheld ordering system upset. She seemed very perturbed that she had to go to the kitchen to correct it. If it causes that much of an issue...maybe it's not the right system. If she thought she was being funny or making jokes, she missed the mark.  We called and had a chat with the floor manager later in the afternoon. We told him about the bad service and the unsatisfactory food. He did admit that all of the soups are very thick and for the most part, spicy. Not much chicken could be found in the the chicken tortilla soup and the chili was mostly beans. He also apologized for the lackluster service and offered a gift card. We went to retrieve the gift card, to use it at the other location on North Oracle (our favorite location.)  When we arrived the next day, 3 very nosy hostesses all wanted to know what was going on when we asked for the gift card. The floor manager was busy and kept us waiting over 15 minutes. The manager finally arrived and was able to open the office door (the floor manager had locked her keys in the office) and get the gift card for us.  North Oracle has a better management style. We have never had an issue there....it's worth the drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2,3.52,3.28,3.28,,3.3760000000000003
43,Mike V.,"Alto, MI",0,1,,5.0,2017-11-11,"We went to BJ's for the first time. BJ's was celebrating Veterans day on Friday & Saturday. BJ's offered $12.95 off your meal. The Happy hour is 3 to 7 Mon.-Fri. & all day Sun. Drink prices very reasonable & 1/2 off apps. Beth was our server & she really took her time with us & we really like that no ""feed ya & street ya here"". The Menu is a Book anything & everything. Beth gave us a lot of suggestions, after about an hour we finally decided on what to get.  I had the Pork-chops they were delicious, my Wife had the mini deep dish Pizza, we shared each others dish & there was plenty of left-overs. We sat in the Bar area by the Kitchen & watched the Servers running back & forth with these wonderful plates of food. First time in a long time we were very impressed with a restaurant. We will be back Sun for the NFL package. BJ's will be our go to place while snowbirding in Tucson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=20,3.56,3.28,3.28,,3.3920000000000003
6,Kevin L.,"Tucson, AZ",6,80,2.0,5.0,2017-12-12,"I had a large catering order for a company party and I was very impressed with the way the Saturday (Dec 9th) team handled it. A few days prior to that, I was given some confusing information so I was a bit worried about how things might turn out. The morning manager that day was very knowledgeable and got my order in quickly and reassured me that the order will be processed correctly. On pick up, the two gentlemen at the carryout station (Edgar and another friendly guy) were nice, professional, and very efficient. They showed what teamwork and leadership is all about. They also helped me carry many items to my car. Above all, this is in the midst of a very busy Saturday night.

3,Alex C.,"Tucson, AZ",38,113,90.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"I honestly don't understand the big attraction of this place. Maybe it's the meat or the sports games playing on big TVs? Neither things appeal to me. They have a novel of a menu and only one item clearly marked vegan, which came in a bread bowl with the top heavily buttered. My friend got a steak well done but it was pretty pink. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was so super oily it felt like taking a half shot of oil in every bite. The sweet potato fries were barely lukewarm when they arrived. The beer selection was subpar. They did have Dragoon IPA thankfully. Honestly if you want a place like this the Yard House is a few minutes away with awesome vegan options and an amazing assortment of beer. Sadly, the work Christmas party picked this place. On the upside, my food was free! Even free food though will not have me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2,3.44,3.26,3.224,,3.3320000000000003
