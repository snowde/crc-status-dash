I wouldn't mind coming here for a football game to do some beer tasting, but as for the food, I think its just average. Not superb but not completely distasteful.  Our service is usually always good which is nice. Honestly when you give me a huge restaurant with a menu that takes me an hour to get through, I usually shy away. The menu is so big and the portions are huge, so if that's for you, this place may be a 5. For me however, it brings my ratings down.

This last time in, service was terrible.  We received some of our drinks right away.  Half of our waters were missing and they brought the wrong beer.  Twenty minutes later our waiter decided to take our order. Twenty more minutes later waiter decided to ask if we want more drinks.  After saying yes, he does not clear the emptys.  This annoys me.  If you have a free hand, take the empty glass.  Ten minutes later says sorry the appetizer is running behind will be soon.  Another ten minutes pass.  Time check, been here an hour and the appetizer is finally coming out.  Ten minutes later food arrives.   For the price and quality of this chain, it is not worth spending close to two hours for a week night dinner.   And they did not even comp the appetizer.  Done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7280000000000006,3.2400000000000007

Lets face it no one likes to be the debby downer. For one entree, and a third of a dessert plus tip I payed $17... Eh... Is all I can say, by no means was the food bad, but for the portion size, and the overall quality I'd rather take my change somewhere else. One thing that they can boast are their pizookies. Those little chocolate chip cookies (which come in varying flavors) serves as a throne that the ice cream sits on and it melts away both in your mouth and on the cookies, and sometimes on your face as you shovel it in as fast as you can.

The waiter seemed in over his head and did not know what he was doing. our waters were constantly unattended , the appetizer took 45 minutes to get to the table. The people next to us got there meals before we even got our appetizer and they were seated after us. The server also screwed up the specials, drink specials, the bills, and what drinks we ordered.

I can get over it. I ordered a Bud, the waitress really wanted me to get one of their beers almost to the point of annoying. The food was pretty lame and took almost 25 min between app and entree... that's a heck of a fire time.  We had some fried articokes or something to start. So boring I can barely rememeber them.  I had a Jalapeno burger and so did my buddies dad, a new item of theirs apparently.  My buddies dad had to send his back cause the meat was actually raw! Cold! and mine was scortched... uh weird!  His mods were all wrong too.  The manager was acutally first to the table for checkbacks and she handled the whole thing well except it took almost 20 min to get another burger at MR... should of been a priority back there.  We took it togo.  My buddies mom and him got lettace cups that they described as ""obnoxious"" and ""way better at PF Changs!""  The waitress said sorry and ""enjoy what you can.""...

94,Jay J.,"Somerville, MA",154,282,26.0,3.0,2012-11-13,"Coming to Tucson for a few months on and off, I was excited to find that the area has quite a few breweries and brewpubs. My doctor hasn't diagnosed it yet, but I'm positive I have OCD when it comes to visiting such establishments, especially ones that I have not been to before. All the symptoms are there, I swear. After some quick internetting, BJ's came up as a contender. Since I was already nearby that night, I decided it was due time to check this place out. While parking I couldn't help but notice how big the building was and how many cars were parked in the lot. Walking in is a bit overwhelming, in a massive sports-bar kind of way. The place reminds me of a Chili's or Applebee's in its design.  I bellied up to the bar during a NFL game with Team A and Team B playing on the big screen and ordered my first beer, the Tatonka stout. It was spicy, sweet, and delicious. Not having had lunch that day, I quickly ordered some food to fight off the immediate buzz it gave me. Being as ravenous and carnivorous as I was, I ordered the five meat hand tossed pizza on the bartendress' recommendation as well as the mac and cheese with crush Cheez-Its on top and ham inside. Both were duly inhaled and I settled on my next beer choice, the seasonal IPA. Slightly dry, it was fruity and balanced. How good was it? I drank it all. Overall, the the beers were tasty and the food was decent. The service was excellent as well. My only gripe is that the place is not my kind of joint being a really large sports-bar with a massive menu. I found out while I was there that it was a chain, which explains the menu with pictures in it. Would I go back? Maybe. But first I have to burn through this list of other brewpubs in Tucson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0520000000000005,3.2400000000000007

The restaurant was relatively empty. We stood in the lobby area for a good 3 minutes before someone noticed and seated us. We did not get our menus until another while has passed. But I can count the clock all I want. The main point is, the restaurant was slow, there was no reason why the service has to mirror the rate of which customers are coming.

Not pretty. We had studied the menu and asked to order drinks and food at once, which couldn't be done because another table ahead of us was waiting to order their food. So drinks first. Then the kids' meals (a nice gesture, but then they were done eating before we even started).  I ordered the Mediterranean pasta, which was supposed to include Kalamata olives and capers (not a one on the plate) and sun dried tomatoes (two pieces). No bread served with the pasta; doesn't that seem odd? Don't count on taking anything home either. Portions aren't that large.

93,John D.,"Tucson, AZ",25,60,3.0,4.0,2013-03-13,"This is not the kind of place you want to venture into on a Friday or Saturday night and expect to be seated and served quickly. If you want to give BJs a shot--and you should!--try to go during the week when it's a little less hectic. Otherwise it's going to be a miserable experience that isn't worth the wait.  Okay, so this isn't starting off as a very complimentary review, but I swear it's getting there. If you're heading into any kind of chain restaurant like this one you have to temper your expectations. You've been to a restaurant like this before and it was good enough to come back to but it's not going to be your first choice if someone is looking for a real ""taste of Tucson.""  You know how this goes:  You start with getting an alcoholic beverage because you notice they make their own beer. It's almost $7 a glass but you don't drink all the time so why not live a little? You order the Snakebite and before you can figure out how the two different beers stay out of each other's way inside the glass, you've already drank half of it. Now you have to order. There's so many choices on the menus--burgers, sandwiches, pasta, pizza--that instead of sending the waiter away for ""one more minute"" for the twelfth time you just order a burger that has jalapenos on it. Burgers are delicious, you say, and jalapenos on burgers are even better. The appetizer you forgot your ordered arrives fairly quickly and it's fried artichokes. They're delicious because come on, they're fried. By the time the burger arrives you're so far into your first (and only) pint that you consume the whole thing and then think about how good it was afterward. You tip the waiter more than you probably would have normally--but he was attentive and awesome and deserves it--and head on your way.  In short, BJs delivers if that's the kind of establishment you're looking for. Just don't go looking for it on a Friday night and expect to be in and out within a reasonable amount of time. Go on the weekday and enjoy yourself more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.248,3.2400000000000007

It hit me, I always drove by this restaurant and told myself I would try it one day! First thing that caught my eye was the beautiful building which is pretty eye catching! Well whoever designed this place did a good job because it worked at catching someone's attention!  To begin with I started my appetizer with their ""Thai shrimp lettuce wraps""....one word...mouthgasm! I'm a Thai guy myself and so my standards for Thai style and food are pretty high, however I must say I was quite impressed! The plate consisted of 4 lettuce leafs each with diced grilled shrimps, carrots, onions and mango salsa. You get this delicious taste of the slightly sweet glazed sauce with a hint of spice in it, in which all us Thai people love spice! Only complaint would be I wish I had more, just because it was so good but I knew this is just the appetizer! So calm yourself down Roger, let's make it to the main dish!  After several debates with my stomach I decided to not order another appetizer dish, instead I went ahead and ordered a deep dish ""Mediterranean Pizza"". Why Pizza you ask? Well from hearing from family and friends, I've heard they made pretty good pizza and I still search for the best pizza  in town. The Mediterranean pizza consisted of grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Mouth watering? Yes! It was pretty darn tasty! The taste of the sun-dried tomatoes just nearly knocked me off my seat and I swear I didn't have a drink!  Overall I was satisfied, impressed here.

The beer is better than average, after all it a brewery! I love the seasonal blends, lightswitch and hefe.

59,Dieu C.,"Tucson, AZ",345,198,155.0,5.0,2013-08-30,"What is good? Everything. Both food & service. You can never go wrong with BJ's. I have always been a firm believer that you should generally stick to ordering only what a restaurant is known for, such as getting pizza (instead of pasta) at a pizzeria or pho (instead of a rice dish) at a pho restaurant. BJ's is well known for their deep dish pizzas and brewing their own beer.  The last thing I would want to do is to offend anyone, but who orders steak at BJ's? If you ask me, it is quite uncommon. My little sister, being the steak novice that she was, decided to order ribeye despite my dissuasions.  No one hates being wrong more than I do...and boy was I in for a surprise! Who ended up eating most of the steak and came back the next two days for ribeye? ME.  Call me crazy, but I like the ribeye here way more than Morton's. It is tender, juicy, well marinated, and a mouthful of yummy. Anddd you get it for the bargain price of twenty bucks! My other most recent discovery at BJ's was their gourmet mac n cheese under the Small Bites section. BEST THING EVER. The mac n cheese is extra cheesy, has large bacon pieces throughout, and Goldfish chip crumbs baked on top to add an extra crunch kick.

Still, I know with me working most of the day and leaving them at the hotel to play, they need something that is fun to eat.  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse fills the bill. The place is large and bustling.  Mixed group of people at dinner time, with the happy hour folks mingling around the bar, and those of us in for a meal scattered around either along the bright windows, or deeper inside where it feels cool and dark.  While fairly typical of the latest variant of the modern roadhouse, it does it very well.  I get to drink a few interesting local craft beers, and my son gets his favorite drink of all time - root beer.  Once he tasted it he was mellow the rest of the night.  I took a sip. Smooth, light, sweet, and chill.  It was okay that he had nearly a pitcher of it.  He would remember it for a lifetime. BJ's seemed to be about pizza and beer, and we saw no reason to stray far from their wheelhouse on the first visit.  2010 was our first sit down, and I still remember the deep dish pies as overwhelmingly thick and overloaded with terrific flavor and texture.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza was enough for 6 people, and the Flatbread Roasted Veggie and Goat Cheese a crispy, glorious treat.  We ordered both of these for the 3 of us, and ended up taking most of it back to the hotel for the next day. The following visit, we had a simpler design; one Flatbread Pizza, One Crispy Jalapeno Burger, Wedge Salad and Gourmet Mac & Cheese for the young man.  All very good, and less to take back with us.  We were a happy clan, especially after trying a Pizookie, their signature dessert.  If you love cookie dough, this is for you - baked cookie dough topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and a square of Dark Chocolate.  It is one delicious hot mess.   Sitting back here on the East Coast as I write this, I can still recall the total satisfaction from the experiences at BJ's.  It makes me dream of returning next year for more of the same pleasures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.3440000000000003,3.4800000000000004

The asparagus still had the hard (end) tips not broken off. The plate needed more color. I got the fish and chips which I only at half of. The batter was tasteless and didn't stick to the fish.

33,Jinny H.,"San Antonio, TX",76,164,460.0,5.0,2015-09-19,"I went to BJ's to watch the football game with a few of my friends. We knew that other places, like Applebee's or any other restaurant on campus (ex. Frog and Firkin) would be super crowded, so we sought out another place that wouldn't be too packed. I'm glad that we chose to go to BJ's. It wasn't crowded at all and we could focus on the game and have conversations without having to shout. We sat in the bar area, so there were lots of TV screens. The bar atmosphere was awesome as well, with the bottles organized in a very neat manner.  The service and the management here was amazing. The server checked in quite often, and was very attentive. When I walked into the restaurant, a waiter immediately asked me if I was looking for a group of people, and walked me to them. Although there was a good amount of people within the restaurant, he made sure to make us feel cared for. I had one of the best services that I've experienced. I got a cider and a salad, both of which were delicious. The cider wasn't strong at all; it was fruity and sweet, just the way that I wanted it. I believe it's one of the more popular kinds of cider that they have, and I can see why. I would recommend it. As for the salad, I got the Asian salad with the dressing on the side. The salad was huge - I couldn't finish it all, but I enjoyed every bite of it.  Lastly, I want to comment on the restaurant's cleanliness. I know that I sometimes take restaurants and their level of cleanliness for granted, but I've gone to some restaurants where their service and food is fine, but their restaurant is unclean. BJ's was spotless, both in the restaurant and in the bathroom. I was impressed, actually, by how clean it was. So... 5 stars pretty much sums this place up.

I ate the mashed potatoes because they're simply amazing but the chicken went back barely touched.

The calamari was delicious and did not last very long. The addition of putting lemon juice on top of it really made the dish and produced an addictive appetizer. Definitely a favorite here.  I wasn't expecting my parmesan chicken to be so huge. The potatoes were delicious, steamed broccoli was pretty standard, but I absolutely did not have room for all the chicken. Not a complaint, just pure observation here. The chicken itself was decent. I loved the crust, just didn't have room after all the calamari, potatoes and broccoli I ate. Good stuff.  Our waitress was attentive and met all our needs. I was a bit shocked at the price of the tab, but I was paying for five people as a treat to my family - a new level of ""adulting"" that I'm evidently not quite ready to take up.  Our wait was a bit long, and we had to wait outside because there were several other parties waiting. Luckily, the Tucson winter wasn't too bad, but two small benches seem silly in a busy restaurant to accommodate demand. My biggest complaint would be how dark the facility was. Although I had no problems, my dad couldn't read the menu and I chuckled when I saw another table take out their flashlight feature on their cell phones to read. If we weren't the only table who thought of it, I think it needs to be addressed. The lighting is dark and intimate, but the tube-shaped lights limit visibility to anybody outside the sphere of light offered by your current fixtures. The menu is also overwhelmingly large. My only suggestion would be to perhaps have a separate drink menu from the food menu, so we're not flipping through what can only be described as a 15-page menu back and forth to make a decision. I know this is beyond this location's capabilities, but it's just a suggestion for corporate.  Great food, good service. I've been here before and will likely come again.

29,Claryssa A.,"Tucson, AZ",14,14,26.0,2.0,2017-04-27,"Just last night I came to celebrate a sister's birthday. We were a pretty large group for the most part. The waitress did a wonderful job accomodating for our large party and she was the only one tending to us. We waited a while to order waiting for the rest of the group to show up. Once we were ready  I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad. I've had it many times before. And it's one of my favorite light dishes there. We waited about 30 mins for our meal which seems reasonable for a big party. The #1 thing that really turned me off was when I recieved my food. The Ahi was clearly old and I said something about it to make it very clear I was unsatisfied. The manager assisting with handing out the food assured me that it was ""definitely fresh"". I played along with it but it was clearly not the best looking. I started eating my salad i tasted my first bit of ahi and immediately spit it out in front of everyone. I was right it was old. It was slimmy and absolutely unacceptable. I was baffled that the cook even released that dish as the Ahi was very bad. I asked the waitress if she could bring me actual fresh Ahi. She did. I got the fresh serving of Ahi and I was even more stunned to see the difference just enforced my thoughts that I was served bad fish. That is what really ticked me off. How could you send something like that out to a customer? And then to tell them its fresh? I showed the waitress the difference and even she agreed that it looked gross but still tried to defend the manager saying it wasn't his falt.  In my eyes it is very much a fault and  you should know this food better than I do and if it doesn't look right it shouldn't be served to a customer. I really didnt want to make such a huge scene as we were there to celebrate a birthday and I was not about to ruin that moment but the food was disgusting. Even though I recieved a fresh serving of ahi after that one bite of the old slimmy ahi I was grossed out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=20,3.36,3.57,3.57,,3.486

I asked that he'd make sure with the kitchen that they were and I expressed my reasoning behind asking, but he reassured me that he already knew they were all beef... so I ordered that meal. I went online to check the menu before ordering food two days ago when I went in to grab lunch and came across the spaghetti and meatballs with it saying the meatballs are beef AND Italian sausage.

23,Ali M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,2.0,2017-07-12,"Popped in on a weekday afternoon, husband and I were both off early, and it was just before 4:00pm. Figured we could grab a quick happy hour snack/early dinner. We sat ourselves in the cocktail area after talking to the hostess.  Now I know sitting in a bar/cocktail area can lend to iffy experiences, but this cocktail area appeared to be very well staffed. The restaurant was not busy, though it did start to pick up slightly around 5:00.  Things seemed to be kind of off from the start, I chalked it up to the group a couple tables down from us that seemed to perhaps be employees? (all were in street clothes) but various ""working"" employees seemed to keep visiting the table for extended periods of time. Including someone who looked ""managerial"" though I never saw him again after the group left.  It was very noticeable the amount of tables who at various times were looking around for their servers... Everything just seemed to take way too long with our server. After we sat, I got up to use the restroom, came back and waited a few more minutes before we were greeted/drink order taken...so that is what, at the very least 5 minutes? Then it took about 5-10 minutes for the drinks (two waters) to arrive and our food order to be taken.  The food came in a standard amount of time for a selection of appetizers (which is all we ordered, what with it being happy hour), but then we didn't really see our server again. He would walk by, and not refill our empty beverages, and stop to talk to the table of what I think may have been employees, but we had to stop other servers twice to ask for water. (lots of ice in the glasses) I think he checked in once while we were eating, to his credit.  The group left about midway through our time, but alas their absence didn't improve the service... After we had finished and had been sitting for awhile, he stopped by and asked if we wanted a pazookie. We declined, and then proceeded to wait about 10-15 minutes before the bill was dropped off. After waiting another 10 minutes (I was keeping time at this point because what the hell.) we got up and asked the hostess and the server chatting with the hostess, if they could run the card. The server went to find ours and our server brought the receipt back to the hostess stand...apologizing saying he didn't see the card ready in the bill holder...but I'm assuming that's because he was chatting away at the end of the bar with another server.  He proceeded to blatantly watch me as I went to sign the receipt, so I went ahead and asked if he was going to watch and he said ""oh no, I'm just waiting to take it back""...so glad he decided to start being on top of it at that particular moment...when it really counts... The food is mediocre and very standard, so you would think a chain like this would hold something like service to a higher standard...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson?start=20,3.28,3.59,3.59,,3.466
