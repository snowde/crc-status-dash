530,Trisha F.,"Kent, WA",5,12,5.0,4.0,2012-01-27,My husband and I love coming here. On this lovely night we decided to share a plate of the Texas chicken fried steak :( :( DON'T EVER order this EVER!! Unless you love salt. Maybe it was a bad night for Mr. Chef because he couldn't even pull off steamed veggies without it tasting like pure salt... This made me very sad. Now for the bright side..... Our waitress Madeline was absolutely AMAZING! The cutest little thing with a great personality and very attentive. They took our steak off of bill and gave me a much needed and refreshing salad on the house. Soo with that said we still are fans of this place but will NEVER order that again and u shouldn't either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520,3.36,3.11,3.11,2.7039999999999997,3.21

379,Chris L.,"Seattle, WA",104,62,126.0,2.0,2012-02-11,"Bj's is like Red Robin with better alcohol. It's the kind of place parents love because they can have a halfway decent meal (or a large number of cocktails) while their kiddos throw stuff and color (although I have two words for you, parents: kaiten sushi. Perseverance, too, although that's now three words. I trained the kiddo on good food early and now he requires crayon-pack-and-kids-menu fix only infrequently). The food? Meh. Notable was their inability to serve any food without dousing it in sugar, from the glaze on the steak to the syrupy chicken lettuce wrap filling. Steak was overly gristly and well under mid rare: better than overdone, but still, it's steak - it ain't that hard to not do wrong. Our server was helpful and tried to be attentive even though he was deep in the weeds. The runner that brought our plates never took any dirty ones away, leaving that to the already-overworked server.  If you are at Southcenter with kiddos and have already given up, go ahead and eat here. Everyone else - these are not the sliders you are looking for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=360,3.28,3.1,3.1,2.504,3.1720000000000006

The first time I was meeting a friend.  I ordered one of their own beers.  It was disappointing.  I feel like if you're advertising yourself as a brewhouse, you should brew decent beer.  I got a fried buffalo chicken wonton plate for $3 or so and it was delicious.  My friend showed up and we got some avocado egg rolls.  They were ok, but nothing impressive.  The pizzas we both ordered were mediocre, but not worth what I paid for them at all.  The server was clearly rushed and brought my dining companion the wrong drink.  We sat there for a bit (it was a weekday afternoon and they weren't very busy) and the server abandoned us shortly after we finished our food, dropping off the bill and letting us know she was leaving.   I came back again the other day with another friend.  This time I was smart and did not order BJ's brand beer.  We got an appetizer plate that had a sampling of items.  We replaced the spring rolls with extra mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were lukewarm and the dipping marinara sauce was overly sweet.  There was also avocado egg rolls again which were ok.  The other item on the plate was spinach dip, which my friend mostly ate, but the chips for dipping were super salty.  The server working the bar that day was better, which was nice, but it still wasn't that great of service. Overall, for how expensive this place is, I'm not a fan.  I feel like if I'm paying $20 for an appetizer platter it should be impressive.  If I'm paying a lot for a pizza, it shouldn't taste like I cooked it out of the freezer myself.  I've definitely experienced better probably won't be stopping in anytime soon again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=200,3.28,3.11,3.11,2.568,3.178

But BJ's is known for their brew, so that's why a lot of the time that I do come here, one of the guys always wants beer. This place is big, but not huge. sometimes, the tables are close together where people often stare at you, and/or it's SUPER LOUD. But our server was great. I love having good jokes with the waiter and he was just that... he was funny & played along with our jokes. He was actually good. He told jokes, checked in often, and was friendly. Didn't go out of his way for things, but honestly he was a damn good waiter.  I can't remember which drink I got. It was some kind of Sangria that was supposed to be made by one of the BJ's workers. But it was SO weak. It's supposed to be one of the ""stronger"" drinks but it was whack! I tasted some wine, but that was it. NOT strong at all. It was more fruity than anything. I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered their wonton and mini bruschetta. I actually really enjoyed their wontons & bread. It was small, worth the cheap prices and tasty. I also tasted the stuffed mushrooms which were sooo goood! I enjoyed that. I've had their tomato and cheese salad, I think. And that was good too. Normally, I always get the chicken fried steak here. I think it's good, but not the best. At times, dry & bland, but the gravy makes it taste all better.  I rate this place 3/5 stars because of the food, overall. I mean, they have good brew but other drinks suck. And their small bites were good.  I'll keep coming back... or not.

526,Carollynn Z.,"Poulsbo, WA",17,8,6.0,1.0,2012-04-13,"I would give it a 0.5 if I could but the lowest available is 1. This is the second worst restaurant experience I have ever had; a close second to my worst restaurant experience where the waiter was on drugs and the chef was drunk. At least the food was good at BJ's when it finally got to use 1 1/2 hours later and the waiter was nice just totally overwhelmed. We were with a large group and had a reservation. The restaurant knew that our party would have 40 to 50 people. We had one waiter with a little bit of extra help. It took about 90 minutes to get our food, and another 90 minutes before we got our bills. Some people in our party were there for 3 1/2 hours total.  Although the waiter seemed totally inept, I think it was more to do with procedures, training and inefficiencies. The protocols for taking orders and getting our checks seemed very cumbersome and not user friendly to the wait staff. Here are some other things that seemed due to poor training and management issues: 1. There were a lot of waiters around but our large group only had the one waiter and a little help from some other waiters at times. Poor planning for a large group. 2. Waiters were scurrying back and forth from the kitchen/bar with only one or two dishes. They never seemed to carry more than one order at a time. 3. Combine number 2 with the fact that we were in a very long room with only one door at one end, the wait staff had to make a long trek from wherever they had to go to get food and drink to tables at the far end of the room. Those waiters spent 85% of their time walking and 15% of their time actually helping the diners. 4. Several of us at the table did not have utensils or napkins. One of us asked a passing waiter, not our own waiter, to get us all some forks, napkins, etc. The waiter came back with only one set for 7 people. We had to request service for the rest of us and it took another trip to make that happen.  5. We sat for at least 30 minutes before we even got water. And another 30 minutes before we got our drinks.  6. When the checks finally got to us, there were multiple mistakes and an automatic 17% gratuity added in.  The only good thing was that the food was hot and tasty when it got too us. Or maybe we were so hungry by that time we would have eaten anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520,3.16,3.07,3.07,2.5960000000000005,3.106

I'm pretty sure it's a 1.99 mega-can of off-brand chili from the Cash&Carry.

427,Jo A.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,5,2.0,5.0,2012-05-10,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse 'had me at hello.'  Here's the story, my husband and I, tired from shopping at Southcenter Mall, decided to try BJ's before driving home.  We entered the crowded restaurant, and were seated almost immediately.  The hostess took us to a large booth (the only one available) and we sat down. She said our server, Michael, would be with us shortly and left us alone.  Ten minutes passed, and no one came by.  We looked at the menu, talked about what we would order, and waited another five minutes.  Finally, Michael came over and asked us how long had we been waiting?   I said, ""About twenty minutes. (I tacked on five minutes for 'wait trauma').  He apologized profusely and said that they would do something about that.   I said no problem, it wasn't a big deal.  But he said it is a big deal and we'll do something about it. Michael couldn't have been nicer as he explained the menu.  We decided on the Avocado Egg Rolls and Housemade Italian Mini Meatballs for appetizers. For dinner, we ordered the barbequed pulled pork. I went to the restroom, and when I returned our appetizers were there.  They were delicious!  The wontons were crispy, and the blend of avocado, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle pepper and spices in the wrap couldn't have been better.  Next, I sampled the mini meatballs tossed in Marsala marinara sauce and it too, was delicious.  While we were waiting for our dinner, a man came over and said he heard that we had a long wait time; he was sorry for that and wanted to make it up to us by comping our appetizers.  I immediately calculated that would be around $15.00 taken off our bill.  We thanked the man (the manager?) and when he left, I said I thought that kind of service had gone the way of the Dodo bird. Our pulled pork sandwich came and I was not disappointed in that either: Their special sauce was tasty as well as their signature coleslaw. After we had eaten, Michael asked if we ""saved room"" for dessert. Yes, we had---we had 'saved' the price of two appetizers.  We ordered one Apple Berry Burst Crumble that was touted as being a delicious blend of apples and berries with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. When the Apple berry Burst Crumble arrived, Michael set it down, asked us if we wanted anything else and thanked us for coming.  We told him how much we enjoyed our food and he gave us the bill and left. The dessert was---how many times can I write delicious?---well, whose counting?  It was delicious. When we go up to leave we knew that we would return and it wouldn't be just when we were shopping in the mall;  BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse would be a destination all by itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440,3.12,3.06,3.06,3.0920000000000005,3.0840000000000005

Now I know how Gordon Ramsey feels during episodes of Kitchen Nightmare, we may see BJ's there soon enough. I've actually been here a couple of times when they first opened and remember the food was at the level of Cheesecake factory and they do have yummy sodas like the Orange Twist, etc. However, came here yesterday to celebrate Father's Day with my parents, and boy was it just plain awful. The Food: Full Rack of Ribs with Salad & Baked Potato  - The ribs were so dry and not well cooked that I could barely cut the ribs with a  steak knife. Asked for some BBQ sauce but the taste was too off, also way too salty. Basic salad with some croutons (Like what you would get from a salad kit from Safeway) and just got a regular baked potato, no butter, etc. Turkey Club with Thin Fries It was like eating a salt-lick, nuff said... Medium Sweet Pig Pizza: This was the worst of the worst, even way below the standards of Pizza Hut or Dominoes. It was essentially 98% dough, 2% cheese and toppings. There were barely any toppings for a $20 pizza, some small dobs of tomato sauce, very thinly sliced pieces of ham and bits of pineapple. It was like eating a very oily, greasy piece of bread, just plain horrible. The Service: They were not busy but a bit too slow, waited 15 minutes to get BBQ sauce for my dry ribs. we only got one re-fill. Still left a 15% tip because it will be the last cent BJ's will ever get from me. Overall, they need to remove the restaurant out of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse...

We ended up getting two appetizers, an entree, and dessert without breaking the bank. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, I enjoyed the fact that they weren't just stuffed with parmesan cheese and salt. The mac n cheese was dang tasty too, the addition of chunks of bacon certainly helped.  We also got the buffalo chicken pizza, which as one reviewer said wasn't particularly overflowing with toppings compared to how much bread there was. Still, it was good, tasted like wings on a pizza. And who doesn't love things smothered with ranch dressing.  We finished the meal with a red velvet ""pizookie"", their sort of signature pizza-cookie dessert thing. Oh God. It. Was. Heavenly. Gobs of vanilla ice cream melting over a hot pan of red velvet cookie with cream cheese frosting bits? Yes please.

Great menu and excellent tastes all-around. Their menu has a flash of comfort food mixed with select Italian entrees, gourmet burgers and a specialty dessert that has me looking at my car keys and planning my trip.  The bar area is a great place for men and women alike but because this BJ's is attached to Southcenter, it becomes a hideaway of sorts. Every devoted husband starts losing focus after our wives stare and tries on the same shoe for longer than 15 minutes. Honestly, just buy it and move on. Anyways, BJ's has its own brewed beers and flat screens which means we can escape the shopping madness, watch a couple games, try some seasonal beers and enjoy some appetizers.

All of them were really good and I would order them again. The reason it gets 3 stars (a low 3, mind you) is for the service, which was horrible.

We'll wait. 20 minutes later they finally sat us. 30 seconds after sitting down, the waitress asked if we were ready. The menu here is like a book, so we asked for more time. We didn't see her or our drinks for what seemed like forever. Finally, she came back to take our order and when she brought my salad, I had no silverware with which to eat it. I tried to flag down a different waiter, since she was nowhere to be seen, and was blatantly ignored. I finally caught someone's attention and managed to get silverware, but c'mon. Really?? The other thing which was annoying and turned me off to the experience was when she brought us our drink refills. She brought them to the table and left them, leaving empty handed. So all our empty glasses sat on the table with us the whole meal. By the time we left, there were 5 empty glasses on the table... There were only 2 of us present.  At one point she even cleared our plates, reaching over the glasses, and still didn't take them.  Next time, I'll just order takeout.

371,Meri D.,"Seattle, WA",30,90,,2.0,2012-11-08,"Meh, meh, meh... I've been to this place a handful of times, and I always leave wondering why I chose BJ's in the first place.  Oh yeah now I remember...I've got friends who have the misfortune of living south of Seattle, so when we want to get together, we generally choose to meet in the Southcenter vicinity. Most of the restaurants around there, besides being chains, either don't offer happy hour or end their HH before 7 pm. Hence, we always find ourselves at BJ's. BJ's isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. Their beers aren't memorable, and neither is the food. The last time I was there with a girl friend of mine, we got awkwardly hit on by some weirdo. Did BJ's become a meat market for the south end without me getting the memo? It just feels so contrived for that sort of thing, but then I looked around and realized we may have been the last to know. This is obviously not BJ's fault, but being practically ignored by the servers and waiting 35 minutes for shrimp lettuce wraps IS their issue. Oh, and since when does $1 off drinks and $2 off overpriced appetizers constitute happy hour specials? I guess I've just been spoiled living in Seattle within walking distance to some amazing places. Anyways, I wish someone would recommend a good local place that has reasonable happy hour times to meet friends south of Seattle.

On top of that slowness (granted one item was a well done steak, so that takes a while) three of the four dishes were cold, the one that wasn't cold was the steak, likely because it took the longest to prepare so the other three sat under an inadequate heat lamp.

Went here last night and ordered some beer appetizers to start off...After waiting 25 minutes for some brushcetta we asked about our beers and she had totally forgotten. Whatever, she's just a little flustered maybe even though it wasn't that busy. We then order our meals and it literally takes 50 minutes till she comes and apologizes for the wait and gives us a free small caesar salad. The couple next to us had been sitting for 15 minutes and hadn't even received any menus, so they left.  A few minutes later they bring out my deep dish medium pizza - which, by the way isn't even deep dish anymore it is essentially pan pizza...they don't even use the black pans anymore. I told her that I ordered a deep dish and not a hand tossed and she said that is just how they make their pizzas now and had no idea why so essentially it's just a lot of dry fluffy dough. Then, I realize the pizza is completely the wrong order with none of the toppings I asked for. By the time I finally get my pizza my friends are done with their food so it's pretty pointless now...yet again, another issue - they didn't put sauce on it! I asked my waitress and she brought me a rameken of marina to dip my pizza in I guess? It tasted like DiGiorno frozen pizza and marinara sauce, and she brought it to me COLD! Pizza with no sauce and cold marinara to dip it in? Gross. I had my friends try and they agreed it was terrible. I've had their deep dish pizzas when they used to make them the good way but I will NEVER be going back with my family or friends and will tell everyone I know to steer away from this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440,2.84,3.0,3.0,2.18,2.9360000000000004

The service is half-assed better than previous visits, but only because they're more persistent  - not because they're actually providing good service.  A friend ordered a glass of wine and the waitress came back with a beer.  She had an attitude about it too.  ""What, is beer not okay?""  Seriously?!  Here's an idea: Maybe you should bring the patrons what they ask for, and not what you think they should have.  Or maybe, just maybe, because you screwed up, you should offer to give the guy the beer and hurry off to get him the wine he ordered.  Just saying.  If it wasn't for the fact that we had a big group and she was guaranteed a tip, I would've taken that beer straight out of her tip. And left her nothing. But really, the service wasn't the biggest issue.  The problem would have been the food poisoning that both my husband and I got.  Nothing like hugging the porcelain bowl all night long.  Thankfully, our infant son was in another room and can sleep through the night, because there was no way either one of us was in good enough condition to tend to him. How do I know it was my dinner that gave me the food poisoning?  Because it's the only meal both of us had eaten together in 2 days.   Yes, no more BJ's for me.  Bad service and food poisoning in one visit would be the final straw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=320,2.72,2.94,2.94,2.372,2.8520000000000003

Cucina! and Bahama Breeze), I consider myself pretty understanding with delays and wait time, esp if the food is worth it.  Especially in the Southcenter area, how many times can you do Olive Garden, Red Robin or Applebees?!  I find it interesting that patrons will wait for over 30 minutes and not say anything rt away for fear of someone 'ruining' their food. Honestly I return to BJs for their PIZOOKIE'S and Snacks and Small Bites.  The Cookie's and Cream Pizookie is so good!  And the Red Velvet was tasty, too!  You can even do the Trio and select 3 different pizookies.  Their small bites are like happy hr selections available anytime.  New $2.95 BRATWURST SLIDERS were excellent!  Try the wontons or the fresh mozz and tomato salad, too. As for the subpar service, I can only speak for myself but whether I sat in the bar with a friend or dined in with my nephew and nieces, we have had nothing but pretty good service.  Especially when I brought my nephew and nieces, our server was friendly and engaged them (which I appreciate).  I would probably come more often if the Happy hour value was more competitive!!!  Just $2 off for HH apps?!  Why not half off?

The one I most often order is supposed to be toasted, and when they brought it out the bread was disgustingly stale, sopping wet with dressing, and not toasted. They are close to where I work, and if it were not for convenience, I would never go there again. Also, I hate calling a restaurant that offers to go and curbside service who never answer their phones. Today when I called, it took calling four times and 20 minutes to get them to answer.

There was a good chance that I would've ordered it as well. Also surprising that they have a small plates and bites section on the menu with most item under $5 if you're not that hungry or just don't want to spend much $$$. I ordered the BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger which was pretty good. I also ordered the thick cut fries (jojo's) that came with it instead of the shoestring ones and they were good as well.

510,John J.,"Bellevue, WA",43,47,,1.0,2013-03-24,"Went here for my son's birthday.  It's been his favorite place to go for his birthday for years.  Tonight: How disappointing. The place was fairly busy as we arrived, though that busyness tapered off after about an hour.  The booth where we sat was our customary booth - things were really looking good for us as we settled in, ordered our apps and drinks, and watched some March Madness coverage. Things began to fall apart when the appetizers arrived and we realized that no appetizer plates had been brought out.  We asked for them, and the young gent bounced off as if eager to get them for us.  We gnoshed on our teasers for about 5 minutes before we noticed he'd not returned.  Irony:  As my son finished the last potato skin, our server showed up with 5 plates... which she absent-mindedly set next to the three empty appetizer plates - unable to recognize that they were no longer needed. Order taken, we sat and watched our games a bit longer.  The server returned and placed my side salad directly in front of me.  Asked if I needed anything else, and sauntered off before I could point out that I had no silverware.  Raised index fingers and excuse mes didn't stop the next 5 servers who passed by.  One of them eventually stopped, looked at my table, then kept on going as if unable to recognize that a) I really needed help, and b) that something was missing.  Another stood in the server station watching me as I looked to my plate full or Caesar Salad and began picking at it with my bare fingers.  He, like the others, disappeared without fixing the problem.  Eventually, our flight attendant/server returned and asked if all was well... as if my still full plate of salad wasn't indication enough... and I asked politely for a roll of silverware.  She said, ""Sure thing!""  And poofed again.  10 minutes passed.  A short Hispanic woman walked by with a tray full of silverware and started loading up the empty tables with fresh settings.  I had to go and try, through her broken English, to explain that I needed 5 settings worth.  Just as I got the rolls I required and returned to my table, the server appeared with 5 more rolls of silverware and a comment, ""Oh?  Decided not to eat it with your fingers?  Glad you got that sorted out."" And took off again. As I predicted, the food arrived moments after my first hunger-driven bite of now wilted and soggy salad.  Drink refills were slow to follow.  We ended up staying nearly 2 hours to finish our meal and get out.  Note:  Our formerly absent server was anxious to bring our check, make sure we paid our bill quickly, and attentive to ensure we cleared out quickly so she could get the table ready for someone new. Side notes:   - The manager was standing in the station next to our table as we complained about the service.  He heard me, looked up, frowned, and then stalked off.  No apology.  No attempt to make it right.  And nothing taken off the check. - We mentioned my son's birthday to the server.  No mention was made of his special occasion the rest of the meal.  When presented with our check, we were offered the ""upsell"" on dessert, but not the complimentary birthday comp that usually is a no-brainer at BJ's.  My son was actually angry that she'd forgotten - asked me not to make a big deal about it though. - The bathrooms were filthy.  Clearly they had not been attended to in hours. - As I walked out, I took note of the light fixtures.  All of them had caked on dust bunnies on the tops... especially on the cables hanging them from the ceilings.  This had me questioning the cleanliness of the entire restaurant. We've decided we won't be returning to the Tukwila restaurant any time soon.  We may try one of their other locations, because we like the food and the hand-crafted root beer.  But for now, Tukwila is a no-go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=500,2.8,2.99,2.99,2.148,2.9139999999999997
325,Razel M.,"Seattle, WA",149,256,44.0,2.0,2013-03-25,"I've never really had a problem with BJ's. I mean sure, it's a chain restaurant, and they don't really have a specialty aside from their beer. But it was the kind of place you could go for fairly decent food where everyone would find something they liked. And there are pizookies, of course. My experience today kinda ruined all that for me. We went for a coworker's birthday lunch. Usually for these things, 1.5 hours is enough. Well, not at BJ's. Long story short, we waited so long for our food that some of us had to ask for it boxed up because we had meetings to go to. Thank goodness I had a small (non amazing) bruschetta appetizer to tide me over until my meeting ended. Then I ate my food and was even more upset because what the hell, it wasn't worth the wait. I had got the Tuscan Limone Chicken pasta, which was supposed to have a lemon butter sauce. There was no lemon in the sauce -- and the pasta was overcooked, and seemed that they had rushed it so much that they didn't even drain it properly. My sauce was watery with a very slight hint of butter. One of my coworkers ended up with the same watery pasta, so she ended up eating the shrimp off her scampi and tossing the rest. I hate when I pay so much for food that I can cook better at home. I hate when I pay for food that leaves me so unsatisfied I end up searching high and low the rest of the afternoon for other food that would erase the literal bad taste in my mouth and make me feel satiated.  And, as someone who works in the service industry, I hate when service-oriented places like restaurants don't take responsibility. The rest of our party had ended up waiting hella long for their bills to come out and were told, ""Oh sorry, it's because you asked for separate checks."" No word of apology about the food taking hella time to come out, no apology for the state of the food when it came, and tried to pass on the blame to the customer. That was the last straw for me. Because of pizookies (which, oh, I didn't even have time to eat today), and the good root beer, and previous okay experiences, BJ's gets to keep 2 stars.

He actually slammed the door to the kitchen (I saw, because we were seated near the bar).  Once we finally placed our food order, he was visibly displeased and my date felt guilty and ordered an extra drink to compensate which seemed silly but whatever. It's BJ's. I'm sorry if you aren't making enough in tips. Mall restaurants tend not to pay that great; especially not when you're a jerk. So anyhow. You get the idea.

591,Denise D.,"Seattle, WA",0,93,,3.0,2013-04-07,"The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because we actually had a really decent waitress. Now let's start at the beginning: gone is the time/era where young people employed and in a working environment actually convey a greeting and manners. This was surely in effect with the hostess located behind the front counter (this is the person who greets people) and this was also in effect for the other hostess (this is the person who takes you to your table) who led us to our table. Hostess number 1, neither observed nor spoke to us being in the restaurant for at least 5 minutes. She was heavily engrossed in her computer system. A quick, hi there how are you and I'll be with you in a few moments would have been really nice. Yeah...that didn't happen. Hostess #2 had zero personality and conveyed this. She led us to the outer area, which was empty but which had a huge ladder in place; it wasn't the most welcome of atmospheres/environment and we didn't care for the area. Actually all of the restaurant was empty since it was open only for a little whilte. We did not like this area and asked if we could be moved inside. She did not care for this request and simply said ok and walked back inside. Wow, if it was just me and not my husband and myself, I would have walked all of the way out. We also observed another couple come in with the same young lady and while you tried to seat them in the same area, they weren't having it either and she was just as friendly with them. First impressions are huge and these 2 young ladies are doing a huge disservice to this restaurant with their personalities or lack of. Enter our waitress, very nice, very helpful. My husband ordered the asian wrap and the house made rootbeer. I ordered the turkey club and a side of avocado with iced tea. The drinks came promptly. The rootbeer was heavy with vanilla and that's a shame because it took away from the flavor of rootbeer. The time for us to receive our meals, considering the emptiness of the restaurant was about 15 to 20 minutes. After almost finishing, our waitress asked if we would like dessert. My husband ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Ok the wait for this 20 minutes plus. This is the 2nd time for us coming into this place. The first time was a long time ago, it wasn't so great but we thought we'd give it a try, to see if maybe it had improved.Well.....ok not much. Food is ok, nothing to say at a later date...hey remember that really good meal we had at BJ's? Nope not happening. The people working here....management, you have some work to do.

BJ's was never good to me :( literally the only thing I enjoy here is the root beer float and calamari. from time to time the pizookie can be my sweet tooth craving fix, their appetizers are better than the actual meals... other than that, their entrees are tasteless to me. Their scampi pasta was like plain pasta tossed in w some veggies, sprinkled some green things and topped it off w a couple shrimp and bread sticks... all of that, yet I still feel like I ate just plain pasta. Other time I came here, I had a pizza. It was the BJ's fave or something... it was first on the menu and I was disappointed. It was such a soft pizza like I'm eating straight up dough.

The food was always great and even when it was busy, I never use to wait over 30 minutes for my meal. Recently it's changed. I had dinner here last night and would have say it was the worse experience I have had here. It was busy so I knew the service was going to be slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow. As my friend and I got our table, we ordered 2 small plates first to start off the night. As we sat, 3 other couples came and were seated around us. Tell me why they got their appetizers before my friend and I got ours? Oh because our waiter hardly ever came to check on us.  Though our waiter was nice and friendly, we felt as though we weren't given any attention at all. We finally ordered our meals and got our small plates which were good. Now the wait begins. The three couples that got seated way after us all recieved their food. My friend and I looked at each other and was like ""wtffffff?"" and of course our waiter saw what happened. We were going to tell him to cancel our meals because we had other plans but he rushed back out with our plates and told us ""sorry to have made you wait. THe deep fried onions that goes on your plate is still being cooked right now and I will bring it out once it's done."" Deep fried onions?? Ain't that the first and fastest thing to be cooked on the chicken balsalmic dish? I ordered the Tuscan chicken limone and I have to say, my dish just didn't taste right. Plus you can tell that it's been sitting under the heater for some time because the sauce had dried up on the plate and on my pasta. I had it sent back and replaced with the chicken alfredo. I can totally tell that my waiter was getting annoyed of me. Maybe I should have said something like ""IT'S BEEN ALMOST AN HOUR AND WE'RE STILL WAITING ON OUR FOOD."" When I receieved my dish, many of the noodles were still hard! I pretty much lost my appetite and took all of it to go.  I may be venting too much about my meal but if you're going to serve and cater to the customers, do it right. I didn't want to be the annoying rude customers so I bit my tongue, paid for the meals and left.

I suspect it's because we often eat here on the way home from the airport; I work in my company's Washington, DC, office one week out of every six to eight weeks, and given that there's nothing gluten-free offered on the plane, I'm usually tired AND starving when I get to baggage claim. We are usually hitting BJ's after the dinner rush since my plane lands at 9:30 pm Friday nights. That means we avoid the usual very long waits for a table most of the time, but we've come often enough at dinnertime for me to testify to the waits... ugly. Go shopping! I am a big fan of the giant stuffed baked potatoes (butter, bacon, and cheddar cheese only for me). I also like the balsamic-glazed chicken. My husband likes most of it but tends to stick to their giant salads. My son keeps trying the tiny corndogs and keeps not liking them LOL though he does like the smiley-face fries.  ALL of their french fry options have gluten. Be aware. Service is often half-assed here. We've had long waits for food, mistakes on food, and even mistakes on beverages. That costs them a half to a solid star for me... I'll give them the fourth star now because everything's been correct the last two times we've been. The chain is opening a branch in Redmond soon and since that's much closer to us, I suspect our days of driving to Tukwila to eat here are over, though we probably will continue to do the late-Friday thing when I get home from DC. By the way, the desserts we've had here have all been disappointing and too expensive. Stick to the root beer (it's got sugar) and go get ice cream or frozen yogurt in the mall.

423,Jules H.,"Seattle, WA",2,26,1.0,1.0,2013-05-16,"Blech, there's a reason I've never gone into BJs and today solidified why. My visiting Midwestern coworkers didn't get enough to eat at Blue C and wanted to get these cookie-pizza dessert things down the way at BJs. Sure I'll go with and have a drink but I actually consider sushi a dinner.  We get in the lobby (which had a foul odor) and ask for a table for 5. It's only 5:30 on a Thurs shouldn't be a problem. Well someone will be right with you says the surly and stoned looking hostess that looked like she rolled out of bed and had to come to work. Waitress took a group of 2 to our intended table. Hostess loudly vents her frustration ""She was supposed to take the 5!!"" Nice communication.  Get to our table and ordered some drinks. Our waitress was cold, unfriendly and about 16 years old. My colleague asks about an off menu item she normally orders back east. Waitress repeatedly argues she's never heard of such a thing and you can order these three giant things instead to make up that smaller dish. Ummmm if you still serve the parts why not make up the mixed basket? We put in our orders, a mixture of appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  I head to the restroom and finally discover why the whole restaurant has a funk of dirty restroom smell. There's puke on the floor outside the women's room. Classy. Appetite lost.  Return and find my colleague had asked the manager about the off menu dish. Manager admits she didn't know it and neither did the line cooks but if one did on another day they'd gladly make it, but they don't know what it is. Ok well that was a more appropriate answer, waitress hope you took notes! After an unusually long amount of time the food shows up. All of it. At once. The appetizer that should have come long before my colleague's main dish. Colleague's main dish totally screwed up (she requested no chicken, whole chicken breast on top), other colleague's not-off menu replacement appetizer, and third colleague's dessert. Colleague #1 sent back the appetizer since she couldn't actually eat it with her main dish already there. Colleague #2 had to wait until all of this was gone to order dessert. Colleague #3 finished his dessert. All very odd timing. Why did our waitress not ask about timing of the courses?  Do you want the appetizer with the meal or before? Is a standard question.  If I wasn't enjoying myself hanging out with the colleagues I see once a year in person I would have run away from the stink of this restaurant. Seriously the lobby of your establishment shouldn't smell of sewer. There should not be puke on the floor. Happy hour is longer than the other establishments at the mall but now I know why! No adult with standards would actually want to eat there!! Save your money.

First of all the decor is nice and has a good modern feel to the whole establishment with the proper lighting. Second the food is really nice and tasty, My gf and I decided to share two appetizers for our meal since we weren't too hungry and it was an adequate amount for the both of us. We ordered the California Club flat bread pizza and also got their traditional chicken wings. The flat bread was some of the best I have ever had and it had many toppings. The wings was great with a spicy hot sauce for dipping which I enjoyed. The both of us also ordered their hand crafted sodas which were way better than your traditional sodas. Service could have been better as our waitress was busy with quite a few other tables and we had to wait awhile to place our food orders. Otherwise service was decent for the rest of our meal with them refilling our waters and checking up on us.  One other weird fact was that we were told that they had run out of burgers for the night since a couple people in our group had ordered them. What kind of restaurant chain runs out of burgers?? LOL.

It was a pile of not-crisp romaine, with the rest of the vegetables  chopped beyond recognition and spread around the edge of the plate as an afterthought. The dressing was not good- it tasted like low end bottled vinaigrette. It was not a $10 entree salad by any stretch.  My BF ordered steamed vegetables, which came slathered in butter. When he asked for them to be made without butter, he was told there was no butter on them. When I explained he just wanted them steamed- no butter, or olive oil, or whatever it was, they denied there being any added oils, though it was obvious that there was grease on the plate.

A tad ridiculous. it took an hour for our entrees to come out. Let alone the server forgot to take an order for one of the members in our party, but yet his order managed to come out first. The server and manager apologized an hour after our food wasnt on the table besides a few appetizers (fortunately, we ordered those). they said that they were expediting our food order ahead of everyone else, but yet there was another party of 8 that still managed to get their entrees before us and they were seated substantially later. They said free desserts on the house but that took at least another 30 minutes and once again people who ordered after us received their dessert before us. A person ordered a ""classic baked potato and salad"" but they gave him a classic cheeseburger. We had to repeatly ask for condiments like Ketchup/sriracha. The bills were divided incorrectly and she had to double check on drink orders. It seemed that the whole restaurant was dysfunctional from the server, kitchen, and management.

We had ridiculous waits between seeing our server, our food was mediocre at best when it finally showed (we could barely get our deep dish pizza out of the pan and it was half burned) plus it took a solid 30 minutes for our pizookie to show up. It had obviously been made fresh at the end of that 30 minutes, so where was our original pizookie? And why did it take 20 minutes after we gave our server our pizookie order for her to check and see if we had gotten it? Obviously not, because it wasn't sitting in front of us!!! And apparently their software just crashed so we also have to sit here and wait for our check. To be honest, I'm not feeling the love tonight.

First of all we were seated outside, which would normally be fine, except 1) it is literally right next to the parking lot and besides the cars who like to bump their tunes loud enough to make the table vibrate, there is some kind of disturbing sewer type smell that wafts in every once in a while which is not very appetizing, and 2) we were seated right next to a huge table of about 15 screaming junior high school girls whose parents were (smartly) seated at another huge table next to them (but not quite as close as we were).  We couldn't hear each other unless we were yelling over all the noise.  You may think I'm just talking about the noise you expect when you go into a Red Robin, but, believe me, this was Red Robin times 20. Our waitress, unfortunately, was also their waitress, and was much more occupied with keeping up with all of them than getting our drinks and food and checking on us.  We ordered our drinks right away, but did not get them for about 20 minutes.  We had gotten water and dinner salads before our drinks ever arrived.  The waitress did tell us a couple of times that she was just waiting on the bar, and they were backed up, but seriously!!  Once we finally got the drinks, she never checked on us to see if we wanted refills, but honestly we had decided not to get them anyway cause we couldn't take another half hour of screaming teenagers. The food was so-so.  I liked the flavor of my Tuscan Chicken Limone, but when it arrived, the grease pool swimming in the cream sauce was a bit disturbing.  My husband got the Jambalaya, and said it was just alright as well.  Our waitress did check with us once to see if our food was okay, but managed to do this as she was serving and clearing the other table, and was clearly just looking for the nod and nothing else.  Did she not notice the bone dry beer glass that had been sitting on the table for at least 15 minutes? We did have somewhere to be, but could not get our waitress or find her for at least 20 minutes (and our credit card was sitting at the end of the table as a bit of a clue), so had to flag down another server.  She took our card and said ""no worries,"" but then our waitress magically showed up about 5 minutes later with our bill.  We had to tell her that we'd given the card to another server, so then she had to go find it.  Finally the manager (I think) came over with our bill and card, and apologized about the service.  I talked to her a bit, and was nice, but let her know what happened.  Gee it was nice she came over to apologize for something she didn't do, but when she handed us the bill, it was still FULL price.  She didn't even comp us a drink or a freaking side salad. I am not unsympathetic to the waitress having to handle such a huge table, but honestly they should have gotten someone else to handle the smaller tables.  I'm pretty sure we won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=460,2.64,2.85,2.85,2.6000000000000005,2.766

The two beers I tried, the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA.  Both beers lacked anything memorable.  The Nutty Brewnette is supposed to be a brown ale but lacked any significant hints of the nutty flavor described.  The Hopstorm IPA was just not ""hoppy"" as I like IPAs to be. For dinner, I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger.  I was average at best.  The meat was obviously frozen and then thawed which caused the burger to lack any juiciness.  The jalapeños were those tangy ones that sit in a jar of vinegar instead of being spicy like you'd notice in fresh ones.  It is nothing to rave about. As for the service, I really wish owners would stress how much of a difference a smile can (or lack of one) can make.  Our server was either tired or grumpy or both.  She lacked the attention to detail required to notice that there were four of us and only two sets of utensils.  She didn't know anything about the restaurant's participation in the Washington Beer Lovers club.  The only time she was somewhat friendly was when she dropped the check off.

Wasn't too impressed with it but it's price and taste and portion is very reasonable. Lastly their flat bread. We always try to try a different flat bread we come and at different restaurants, we are a huge fan of flat bread however this time we weren't too impressed with their blue cheese steak flatbread, their flat bread is good but the California flat bread they offer is better than the steak one in my opinion. That is because the blue cheese overpowers everything. If you love blue cheese then this is the flat bread for you.

Put my hand down on the booth bench and a (small) shard of glass went into my finger!  OUCH!  They gave us a new booth, a bandaid & about half way through our eats, a manager came over & apologized & offered to pay for my meal.  I  was glad he did that because I was beginning to wonder WTF - - I mean, I was BLEEDING! I ordered an appetizer called Frito Nachos & it was pretty much what it sounds like: nachos made with Fritos. Too much cheese & too little Fritos & chili made about half of it too soupy to eat. But at that point it was free, so what the hey. I also had a scrumptious ""No Guilt Cosmo"" to drink that  was so good I wondered if they used the sugar ingredients instead of the sugar-free. It was good though & I didn't ask if it was really ""Guilt Free"" because we had other problems of a service nature by that time.  My son ordered a sandwich & asked to substitute a Ceasar salad for the house salad that came with it. The server said sure & a Ceasar salad arrived in short order. When they brought out his sandwich a while later, there sat a house salad along side it. The server apologized & said he was getting both salads.  Awesome, right? Not one to look a gift salad in the mouth, he asked for some honey mustard dressing to go with it.   In the mean time, my husband's sandwich arrived along with steak fries. He asked the server if she could bring him some tarter sauce for his fries when she brought out the dressing for our son.  So we dug in, more or less. Problem was neither the dressing or tarter sauce arrived. My husband, who was already annoyed about his wife being wounded by the shard of glass was not happy. The server finally stopped by to see how we were doing, and he reminded her about the missing condiments. She apologized and went to get them. We thought that was where she was going but it wasn't a quick trip.  By the time she came back, he had eaten a lot of the naked fries. She asked him if he would like more fries that would be ""warm"" to have with the tarter sauce (so she realized the fries were probably cold by this time) but he declined. He was, like I said, annoyed.  Not our best trip to BJ's. This location is probably off our go-to list for now, but we will still go to the Puyallup & Tacoma locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=360,2.8,2.78,2.92,2.504,2.788

I brought up the fact they told me the last time I ate there and there were no large groups and I told them I saw a lot of empty tables. We were eventually seated and I really don't know what the issue in seating us was considering all the tables along the wall were empty and to me it looked like there still was plenty of seating. Unfortunately, the group of 16 was seated in the tables next to me and my friend.  I can only describe them as very loud and obnoxious women who must not have ever eaten in a restaurant or their parents didn't have the common sense to teach them how to act in a restaurant as well as dress appropriately.  They shouted to each other and everything they saw like a ""OH WOW"".  They were so loud my friend and I had a hard time talking.   In all my visits to BJs, the one thing I have found irritating is that the server never asks if we'd like anything else before they bring our check.  We always get our check when we plan on ordering more food, dessert or another drink.  My friends and I have  yet to come out with only one check.  Usually multiple checks.  One time my friend came out with at least nine checks because each time she ordered something, the server would close out her check.  I usually come out with two and one time I came out with three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=380,2.8,2.79,2.92,2.636,2.7939999999999996

Since it was a Tuesday night, the place was not that busy. When we walked in, nobody was there to seat us and their phone was ringing. We waited nearly 10 minutes. And still nobody came to the front to seat us. We had to walk up to an employee and asked to be seated. Really?

Not only did we have to asked be seated, the waiter then brings us around a corner and seated us literally next to a really rowdy group. I looked around and the whole row behind me was empty. I really didn't understand why she couldn't seat us a few tables back where my boyfriend and I can actually have a conversation.

It made me uncomfortable and was hoping our waitress will come along soon so we can asked to be moved to a more private seat.  But she took a very long time and I lost my appetite by then, and asked for the check after our drinks. She had asked what was wrong and I told her that the rowdy group's conversation was really disturbing and made both of us uncomfortable.

We ended up ordering from the regular menu but it took about 15 mins until our waiter came to take our order. We finally got our food at 10pm and both of our entrées were lukewarm to cold. The waiter didn't bring out one of my side dishes so I had to ask but it also came cold so he had it remade. Granted, he did offer to make us fresh entrées as well, but we already waited 45 minutes for our food so we ate what we had. (And we HATE eating cold food, especially when we are paying almost $20 each for it.)   I ordered the parm chicken which had good flavor but it was cold and felt like I was eating leftovers.  My friend ordered a well done steak which was SUPER dry and hard.  It looked like the lung of a someone that's been smoking cigarettes for 80 years.  (I know you're going to think it's because she ordered it well-done, but we know how a properly cooked steak should be and this wasn't it.)  She even specifically told the waiter she didn't want it burned on the outside and have it be like cardboard.  She just wanted no pink in the middle. (She didn't request this in a snobby, picky-eater way.  She very politely explained what she meant.) The waiter sent the manager over and he apologized for forgetting the side dish and later had the waiter offer us a free dessert after our meal. We surprisingly declined because it was almost 11pm.  We would've preferred even a partial credit to our check or a gift card with a note, ""I'm sorry we suck at service like we usually do but come back again and experience our sucky service with hot food the next time around.)  ...but that didn't happen. The bar was only half full and the main dining room only had about 8 people by the time our food came.

Then all of a sudden, an employee comes rushing to our table and asks us how we ended up at this table because apparently, this table and the one next to it was reserved for another party that would be there soon. They asked us if we could move to another table and we did. Not going to lie, it was a bit embarrassing. However, our waitress was really friendly. We just didn't see much of her that night since it was really busy. We got our food 20 minutes later but some of us got pasta and couldn't eat because we didn't have forks. So that was another 5 minutes. Food was fine - nothing mind blowing.  Also, to get the discount movie ticket for amc, you don't just give them your bjs receipt. Make sure you ask you waiter about this & they're supposed to give you a gold movie ticket. Unfortunately, we couldn't get them because I didn't know. But after our movie, we came back for free pizzookies & that was yummy.  The food is fine and the waiters are nice but things can get a little hectic when it's busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=220,2.88,2.85,2.896,2.472,2.862

The double deluxe falls apart pretty fast and isn't worth the effort (maybe the pizza would be a good option).

I got the chicken bacon ranch pizza which was good but kind of soggy cause ranch was drenched on top.. We also ordered the cajun pasta off the regular menu. It was okay.

Which I was fine with as I was starving and the thought of going back out to the mall to find something else and possibly wait any longer sounded terrible. I give my name and wait...and wait. Fast forward to 25 minutes later and they are calling a name, which sounds like mine but is not. I go up and speak with the hostess who has written my name down incorrectly and presumably was seating other people before our party because of this. Slightly annoyed but willing to just get a beer and call it a wash, we sit down. We order drinks and wait...a long time. Having been a server I could tell she had too many tables and was sympathetic to this.  Then, I am proceeded to be given the most watered down beer I have ever had in my life. Thinking this was a fluke I ordered samples of their other BJs beers..stout..red you name it which too were watered down...crazy!! Then I order a mens room on my dime because I have had that many mens rooms and theres no way you can screw that up. I was wrong. So. Watered. Down.  I could go into the food situation but I really have no more energy mentally or emotionally to accurately describe the level of dissatisfaction I felt while dining here.

But ok, maybe they're short-handed.  And clearly the nice hostess had the day off, since we got the snarky, kind of rude hostess. After about half an hour or so they seated us. Did they seat us at one of the empty tables? No, they took us to their porch, which was like 700 degrees and tried to put us literally next to a woman with a baby.  I don't mind babies, everyone was a baby, but I do mind being asked to sit *literally* on top of the baby's diaper bag. I was like ""uh, can we sit there?"" which was like 3 feet away and the lady rewarded me with a massive sigh. So we're sitting in this super noisy porch, which is 700 degrees and my fat bald head is under a heat lamp, so I'm like ""can we sit inside?"" And she's like ""you'll have to wait longer"" and I'm like ""what about those empty tables I am looking at with my rapidly-getting-less-satisfied eyes?"" And she walks away without saying anything. Literally.  So already, what the fuck. So I'm sitting there all mad, and my wife is getting mad because I'm mad (when I get mad, she gets mad at me, because she has a higher threshold for being treated like shit by a b-grade chain restaurant hostess) and my son is like ""I'm taking notes for therapy later"" -- he didn't say that, he just was instagramming really intently, but I could tell from his body language. I'm looking at the long and uninspired menu and finally, fifteen minutes later, just as the waitress approaches I'm like ""fuck this let's go"" So we get up. The waitress was like ""whoa, what's wrong"" which was pretty cool, and I was like ""this seating arrangement is not working,"" and she's like ""if you want to wait longer you can sit inside"" and I""m like ""what about those actual empty tables I am looking at right now with my never-going-to-enter-this-fucked-up-establishment-again eyes?""  And again, I don't even know how this is possible, but it's a pretty good trick, she refuses to acknowledge that there are 10+ empty tables mere feet away from us, So we left and went to Joey's next door, which I thought was going to be crazy expensive but actually was probably only 20% more.

We got drinks in a decent amount of time then ordered our steaks. Finished our first round of drinks, started on our second, food still not out. So we're both sitting there real curious what happened to our medium rare and medium steaks since at this point it's been 25 minutes when we ask what's up with our food, new bartender says she'll have our bartender go check on it since she just came on.  Our bartender said they were platting our food up now. A few minutes our steaks came out.  My fork had some dried food that survived the dishwasher on it, I stated such, was offered no new silverware, cut into steak, it was fine. Taste wise, Eehhhh but we were starving as we both had just got off work. So we are our food. Bartender let us know she was getting off and would be closing out with us. Sure, we will close out.  Here's my issue. I work in the service industry, was wearing my work clothes when I came in. When you let my drink be empty for 5 minutes before you ask if we want another, no no. My food taking 35 minutes, especially since it was a medium and a medium rare steak, uhm... No again. No apologies were offered at all or any explanation, which would have made it acceptable. On top of that, letting me know you're closing me out, nope. Should've asked me and given me the option, which I would've closed out anyway like we were told to do, letting me know that's what you're doing, not okay.

68,Gentle V.,"Seattle, WA",60,190,521.0,2.0,2015-02-14,"Overall, BJs is an average restaurant and will do if you're in a real bind. I give it a 2.5/3 star Yelp rating.  This place reminds me of The Ram, Claim Jumper, or other chain restaurants. I've been here a couple of times, but most recently for a Thursday Happy Hour. My friend and I needed drinks before we watched a movie at AMC, and we thought BJs might be the place. **ORDER LIST DETAILS (on the HH menu): --Chicken Potstickers ($5-$6): Four small, steamed potstickers and a pile of shredded carrots as garnish. The potsticker had a good, meaty flavor profile, but the carrots seemed unnecessary on the plate. --California Chicken flatbread ($4): Two small squared pizzas that were a slight step up from a frozen appetizer purchased at a supermarket. --BJ and Strawberry Mojito (~$4):  Too sweet --Lemon Drop Martini ($5): Too bitter, with none of the sweet tartness needed to make this drink soar. There was no sense of balance between the lemon and vodka. Other considerations: PROS: - Convenient location in Southcenter Mall with easy parking options - Happy Hour is Mon - Thurs until 7 PM and it's relatively cheap ($4-$7/ item) CONS: -Food was edible, but the quality could have been better. - Bar area is not big in size, so you have to wait for a table sometimes when it's crowded. - There wasn't anything unique about my experience here, which is too bad.   - Customer service is hit or miss, but more of a miss overall.

Also she knew what appetizers we ordered (from the bar that hadn't come yet) and said that they would be coming shortly.   My food was great I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich (I'm on the hunt for the perfect on that I don't have to make) and I must say it was great the pork was tender and the bread was really soft and delightful.

The only time I ever go here is for group celebrations, not because of the food, but because they can accomodate for large gatherings.  In my opinion, the food here is waaay too greasy, but then again you get what you pay for. The burger buns look like somebody slathered tablespoons of oil on them; it leaves residue on your fingers when you're holding onto your burger. The fries are never as hot as the burger, or the other way around. The pastas, or pizzas for me is always a safe choice when dining. My favorites would have to be the Cajun Pasta and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. They also have their pizookies down to the tee. You can order any one of them and it would taste delish.  Unless you're craving for a pizookie, I would suggest dining elsewhere to make your time worthwhile.

Their drinks, on the other hand, are great! Tasty flavored mojitos and really strong margaritas (I had to ask for extra limes just to finish mine)! If you're a fan of fruity alcohol or hard cider, DEFINITELY try the berry burst cider. It's my favorite drink on tap at BJ's! They also have a bunch of mixed beer/cider drinks which i enjoy trying. So far I like the jerry (something) cider. I recently tried their pear cider mixed with an amber ale and its a new favorite.  pizookies are also fun! Anything is good a la mode.

My husband got a pizza, I got a french dip, one of our dinner partners got a salad, and the other dinner partner got nachos. OK, let's size this up: salad is quick and easy, nachos are quick and easy, french dip is quick and easy, and pizza takes a while. Considering that the pizza should have been the hold-up, my husband's pizza was dry and less than fresh. The bread on my french dip was sweet, which galled me every time I took a bite of what should be an entirely savory sandwich. They left off the cheese ... of everything. Not only did my swiss and roast beef french dip have no swiss, the nachos were almost devoid of cheese. Again, nachos devoid of cheese. No beans, no meat, no cheese. Just salsa, sour cream, and olives. The salad got a good review, however. Good for them. They stuck some meat on some lettuce and didn't screw it up. Sure, we could have sent stuff back, but that would have tacked on another hour.

When we show up & let her know we called she then informed us that 'your name only stays on the list for 20 minutes'. Would have been nice if the gal on the phone told us about that. So we waited about 15 minutes. When we go to order someone in my party wanted to leave off some things on his burger. And she got confused and started making jokes about what he wanted. Sorry but it's your job to accommodate guests, not pick on them. Food was mediocre. Kinda greasy. Bland. My pizza tasted like a mini 'pizza hut' pizza I could get for $5 at Target. Side sauces we got were really watered down. Didn't get drink refills. Asked for a cup of ice 3 times before it got to the table. Everyone seems frazzled and too busy to take care of you.

The restaurant does have a separate entrance for take out pick up so it makes picking up your meal very fast and easy. This time around I got the Barbacoa chicken with a side caesar salad. The chicken was tasty and good but a rather small portion with two smaller pieces. The caesar was good, which I have had restaurants give very small portions and crappy side salads when they are to go. This side salad was a good portion size and rather good.

The restaurant is large and the entire thing is set up like a sports bar but there are two definitive areas. The family dining area and the bar. The staff has always been super friendly and very attentive at every BJ's we've gone to and the food is superb.  From the appetizers to the entrees and dessert. They may be a brewery first and foremost but they know how to hire some chefs! Some of the best calamari appetizers we've had anywhere and if you visit during happy hour, you can load up on multiple appetizers to share and get to sample everything.  They do brew their own beer and I have tried a lot of them but if you don't like anything they make, they do offer a few other brews which is a nice contrast to other brew pubs that only serve what they make.  I've ordered a lot of different items here from their pizza to ribs to steak. I love their rib eye with a loaded baked potato but sometimes, they get steaks with a very high fat content. I like a well marbled steak but near 50% fat is a little too much so I have to try other menu items on occasion to avoid that happening.  The place is friendly and inviting and there are TV's all over the place so that you can watch whatever sporting event is on at any given time and they don't charge an arm and a leg so you won't walk out feeling like you've been robbed.  I will remain a BJ's fan for as long as they keep up the good work.

Once we put in our order it took about 45 minutes to get our food and my pasta came out with the wrong type of pasta. Our waitress came by and mentioned that the manager will come by and see us since we mentioned to her that our order took forever. 10 minutes pass and the manager (Michael) finally comes by.

Besides wanting to drag the butch out by her hair, I was ready to rearrange the entire restaurant. I was furious. Our food arrived shortly after the manager arrived. It was luke warm and cold! It sat for more than 20 minutes, as I stuck my finger down the middle of the burger.  Look, I get it. Servers assume when a young family with 2 kids comes in, they might not tip very well. It was clearly obvious, as an older couple arrived after us, and finished their meals before ours arrived. Needless to say, I am a great tipper, and I always take care of our servers when they give good service. I even gave our server a $5 tip, even though we never touched our food, and left starving. Dinner for me was Taco Bell. At least they can pump out a hot gut rot meal in less than 2 minutes out of a drive thru. My suggestion? Avoid BJ's, especially if you have kids. Perhaps next time, this location can make us drink out of separate water fountains, and utilize restrooms to segregate the poor families from the elegant tippers.

191,Jami B.,"Federal Way, WA",6,9,,2.0,2016-02-14,"So this review is both based on service and food. Let's start with the good. I was looking for a pizza place other than domino's or pizza Hut or the other standard places. We had heard the pizza here was great. Went online and placed our order. The process was quick and easy and we choose to pick up.our food at 11:15. The pizza itself was AMAZING!!! My partner is definitely a pizza aficionado and she adored it. We got the pepperoni extreme. The sauce was great! We also adored the julienned pepperonis. They were great. What made it for us though was the dough. It was soft and ligjt. Sometimes with deep dish you get hard and crusty dough. Definitely not the case here. It's going to be our go to pizza place now!! If this review was only on food, you would have a five star review.  The service was were there this place needs big time work. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a place that was open late. The website said nothing about it being only available to a certain time. Let us do everything and never gave us any notices about takeout being closed. Get to the place and the hostess takes 7 - 9 minutes to even come up front and acknowledge I'm there. Have about 5 servers go by and just give me nasty looks and not ask if I need anything. Finally the lady comes up. When I tell her I'm there for takeout she gets SUPER NASTY! First words out of here mouth are, in a nasty, nasty tone, our takeout closes at ten. Don't place orders after that. I explain that   here and I had no clue and the website didn't advise me so. She then says well don't   again, not jokingly. Then takes her another about 15 mins to.find my order and ring me up. If she would.have just went and got my order and POLITELY mentioned they closed take out at 10, would have been totally satisified. Will I be back?

We weren't incredibly hungry so we opted for sharing. Our cousin and I decided to share a ""make your own"" flat pizza. It was basically a large pita. We asked for it with mozzarella, black olives, and pepperoni. I also asked for sauce because apparently in Washington that's not a given (something we realized after eating at several places during our visit!) The pizza was good enough. It was a bit under cooked so I did miss the crisp it could have had. There was also a bit more grease than I would have liked. We actually ended up ordering a second one since we expected it to be filling enough for the two of us but it wasn't. The second one was crispier but tasted like it used different cheeses and the toppings were more sparse. My husband got the spring rolls and brussel sprouts with siracha sauce as his dinner. He seemed to enjoy both as the sprouts were gone in a matter of  minutes and he polished off his spring rolls later in the night before boarding the plane!

I tried their Nutty Brewnette and while I found it drinkable the beer was not filtered which caused the flavors to overlap. I got a half California sandwich with the avocado and house salad. It was delightful and exactly what I was looking for. The cucumbers in the salad were diced which added originality and something different to a pretty bland dish.

267,Danny -.,"Renton, WA",0,13,,2.0,2016-03-15,"I go to BJs fairly often and love their food, but this location is slowly turning me off the brand. The BJs chain has awesome food, and this location is no different, but my last 3 times at this location, the service has been brutal, and the food has become seemingly more and more disappointing.  I'm only going to mention my most recent visit, as it left me with a bad taste after years of loving this place. I went with my friend and we met at that restaurant fairly late at night. When we arrived, I'd say there were maybe 9 tables with about 20 patrons total so by no means was it busy. We walk in and there is no one at the host station. We contemplate sitting in the bar area to seat ourselves, but neither of us are fans of the bar areas at restaurants. So we wait what felt like an eternity, but was really about 7 minutes before a girl finally notices that we exist. She walks up to us, doesn't say anything, and just kind of glares at us expecting us to say something. A fairly sour greeting I should say. We ask for a table and her reply is ""ok, let me find you one."" She walks away to the basically empty restaurant, comes back after 2 minutes and says ""follow me."" Finally, we are seated. So we sit there looking over the menus, and I see a couple servers walking by us multiple times. We wait... And wait... And about another 10 minutes go by and finally a server who walked by us multiple times and definitely saw us there comes up for our drink order. We tell him we are ready to order (as we are already tired of waiting around) and he says ok hold on. He walks away, comes back after a few minutes (no drinks in hand) and takes our orders. After taking our order, he comes back with drinks finally a couple minutes later.  So as if it wasn't bad enough, it only gets worse from here. We noticed a table near us with two people who looked bored out of their minds. They hadn't eaten yet clearly, and at one point our server walked by and they stopped him and asked how much longer it would be for the food as they have been waiting over 30 minutes. Upon hearing that conversation I realized we really probably just should have walked away when no host came up at the start.  So more than 40 minutes goes by and no food. Finally our server runs over, drops off our food, and starts walking away without saying a word. We needed refills and had no silverware or napkins so I have to uncomfortably loudly yell for him to come back. He quickly brings us napkins, however he seemed to clearly forget the refills as we never saw him again until after we finished our food. Speaking of the food, as always, it was delicious, which is why my review is a 2 star instead of 1 star, HOWEVER, the portions of food are significantly smaller than in the past, which is another thing that's disappointing. Usually I'm so full I can't decide if I can stomach a Pizookie after. This time, I was still starving after finishing my food, but so sick of waiting and this awful service that I just decided to pay my bill and leave and grab a milkshake at McDonald's for dessert.  Anyway, there's my review. I genuinely hope BJs management goes on Yelp and reads reviews and can use this to better train their staff and better serve their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=260,2.88,2.88,2.864,2.568,2.88

We had a classic deep dish pizza - it had a great, soft dough, which I liked. The Santa Fe egg rolls, which we kind of picked on whim, were also quite good.

195,B B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,138,23.0,3.0,2016-04-15,"I've been to BJs in Portland a few times and to this location twice. Same beer. This location is very nicely decorated, music isn't real loud, so that's nice. I don't want my experience to sound like a concert hall. The beer selection is pretty fair. Didn't count the taps though. They had 11 core beers and probably about a dozen guest taps. I found a few I liked. I glanced at the food menu, but didn't order anything since I wasn't hungry. The food prices are definitely those of a nice restaurant. In other words, don't come here expecting to spend under $10 on a plate. There might be some, but the majority of things I looked at were at least that much. Most items were more. Usually I have wraps, sandwiches, or mushroom swiss burgers. They did not have anything I wanted. While they had burgers, it was clear their focus is pizza. I found the beer to be somewhat expensive. A few for $5.95, most were $6.25, which I think is high considering beer is *cheap* to make. The only beers I will spend that much on are German or Belgians from their origin. All of these were standard beers. Place was clean, ages were all over the place. I would say mostly 30s and 40s. Most people were dressed business casual, but it was only about 7 at night, not late, so I wasn't expecting the late night party crowd. Two ladies were bartenders. I didn't catch their names. A young blonde girl with a pony tail and a black girl. The blonde rushed me a little, seemed more interested in getting me a beer than samples, although she did so without incident. If I'm spending over $6 on a beer, you bet I want to know what I'm drinking. I'm not just going to pick something to have a drink. I don't work that way. The black girl was alright, a little more serious, not so much playful. She offered another drink, but I was done at that point. I would go back if I was with someone and we wanted a nice place to go, but I probably wouldn't go back by myself. The beer is a little pricey for me considering nothing was spectacular. Not sure if I would have dinner there since nothing on the menu jumped out at me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180,2.88,2.96,2.868,2.8920000000000003,2.928

The deep dish ravioli wasn't pleasant. The cheese in the ravioli was so dry I finished my water with 4 bites of the ravioli. Which I should've conserved. Because my waiter never stopped by the table to check on my group for drinks or questions. So basically the whole group was sharing water at this point.  To top off the meal. We got our checks and we paid it in three ways because we were a party of 6 that were paired up. Anyways, he repeated the meals to us so he could split it. But when we got the checks it was all sorts of messed up besides one check. We then let the waiter know, and he ""fixed"" it. Or we thought. He still billed me for my friends dessert. I didn't want anymore problems so I just paid his dessert.  Thought it was the end, but it wasn't. The one couple that has the correct receipt paid theirs. And found out they paid $40 less than they were supposed to. They thought they were blessed, until the other couple paid theirs, and found out that they paid the first couple's bill.

160,Clara S.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-08-29,"It takes A LOT for me to write a bad review, I usually opt to just not return to the restaurant. I've been to BJ's a good amount of times at different locations and a proud rewards customer. Six of us went for dinner at 7pm on a Monday and were seated at the outside dinning area. It was not very busy as a little less than half of the restaurant was filled. After taking our drink orders (5 drinks) the waitress came back in a few minutes to take our dinner orders. We ordered 6 entrees and 1 appetizer. When the waitress came back with our drinks we asked her if she could get someone to tell the constructions workers who decided to smoke in front of the restaurant to move. She looked at us and said ""oh."" And then she walked away with our orders. The construction guys never moved nor were they told to move by any staff member and they came back to smoke in the same area once more during our dinner. Our dinner came more than 60 minutes after we put in our order, including the appetizer! I think that defeats the point of an appetizer...I had a stuff mushroom as it was my friend that ordered it, it was lukewarm. The waitress came back to tell us twice our food was being ""plated/almost ready."" When our entrees FINALLY came out more than an hour later (this is not exaggerated, I started timing once it passed 40 or so minutes) my two friends who had fries, had cold fries. We were all too hungry to send it back. After our table decided to get pazookies hoping it wouldn't take as long...we were wrong...our pazookies took 30 minutes! We only ordered 3 of them.  I watched the other tables, there was a party of 7 and a party of 10 that all came after my table and they all had their food in what seemed like a timely manner. 4 other tables with a party of about 4 came, ate, and left all within the timeframe our table of 6 was still there...I honestly didn't get it.  I went to the front as we left to take a picture with my friends who I haven't seen in a long time and to also see if I could speak to someone about our experience this evening. There was no staff member to be found! We stood at the front for 10 minutes, looked around and gave up because honestly I got so tired of waiting. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.

We were with two people who had dined here before so they were able to recommend some awesome dishes. We ordered two flights of beer, two specialty drinks, and two deep dish pizzas to share. This place is very family friendly, we have a 7 month old, and it was nice to feel like she wasn't a burden, There was even conversation surrounding her. I cannot stress enough how wonderful it is to have your child recognized and welcomed in a restaurant, kudos to our server who made us feel like we could dine there.  My flight included a beer they no longer had and another server asked me what I would like instead (after bringing the other five I ordered) I thought this was awesome,they took the responsibility upon them to make sure I had what I needed.

178,Lindsey M.,"Renton, WA",40,9,1.0,3.0,2016-09-16,"I'll start by saying that my 3 star rating is strictly for the food quality/price. I can't speak for the service as a whole, as my first time at this location was about a week ago and we had a horrible server. The only thing that saved our visit this evening for our 4 year anniversary was our server, Sojin. If reviews were based solely on one staff member, I would be giving 5 stars. Actually, the only reason I'm writing a review is to recognize him. Being as I have been a server/bartender for over 15 years myself, I pick up almost instantly if the service is going to be good or bad. As soon as he greeted us I knew we would be taken care of. Awesome and REAL personality, proper timing, prompt on orders, refills, clearing, and checking up on us and his entire section. Now, the food is definitely a different story. Although the menu is quite large, most of the food is less than mediocre and over priced. I ordered a steak tonight, medium temperature, that came out more than well done-it was hard as a rock. Cold mashed potatoes and shriveled up asparagus. I was hesitant to allow the guy delivering the food to make me a new one as we had already waited 45 minutes and a steak is not a fast re-cook item but he walked away and made that decision anyway. It's fine, I get it, stuff happens and I understand that more than the usual guest. Where they really lost me was bringing me another well done steak 20 minutes later. By this point (I'm 9 months pregnant) I really didn't give a damn and ate it anyway. Pretty sad when a cook, whom I assume is at least somewhat experienced, can't even get a re-cook item close to correct.    Thank you, Sojin, for making our night less irritating all around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=80,2.88,2.89,2.904,2.38,2.886

This is just a formality, they don't actually cook burgers to order, so I was not surprised when my burger came out far over cooked, fully dry well-done with no hint of pink. This sucks, but it should not surprise you, as it should be obvious that BJ's doesn't have real chefs custom-grilling food in the back.  If you like flashy decorations, $7 beers, and extremely over-sweetened margaritas, you'll love it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=80,2.6,2.86,2.9,2.504,2.7560000000000002

We are greeted as soon as we come in. The time spent getting seated, ordering, getting our food, servers checking on us and time allowed to eat, enjoy and chat with friends and then wrapping things up have all been just fine! I never felt rushed, I never had to look for someone. It is a standard ""American fare"" with burgers, fish, salads, soups pastas etc. so no surprises there. I like that they do switch the menu around so I see some usual dishes and then I see some seasonal or new ones.  The menu is a ""book"". Tonight I lost my place! There are some ""lighter"" dishes which is good and plenty of appetizers which are pretty large in portion and can be a meal too if you add soup or salad.  it's a brewhouse so lots of beers but also glad they have cocktails, wines and sangrias to choose from as I am not a big fan of beer (yeh....ok....I am not...)  I think the quality of the food is good for the price.  The price is about average in comparison to similar restaurants though I think there are little more ""healthier"" and have more vegetarian dishes to choose from  compared to like Rams or Red Robins.  I shall be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180,2.72,2.86,2.896,2.8000000000000003,2.8040000000000003

I'm a very understanding and forgiving person especially because I've been in the industry for 10 years. I know how things work and why some delays may happen at times and how to recover from them. I always give service workers the benefit of the doubt. The host team and manager at the host desk deserved none because even when their joke of a ""reservation system"" is so flawed, no one apologized for the inadequate way they handle reservations, acknowledged us for the loooong wait we endured just to get a table or even thanked us for being so patient. We had already been waiting so long that we decided to just commit to eating here rather than finding a new spot. For what it's worth, the host team was just a handful of (seemingly inexperienced) young girls doing what they're told to do (I've been there) but they turned to a clueless manager who still was unable to address any of our concerns appropriately or effectively for help. The only redeeming quality was our server Desmond who was very attentive and genuine. He did everything right as his role as our server. EVERYONE ELSE from the host team to management to the expo and the kitchen staff failed us. I understand some things the server has no control over so we took care of him because he apologized profusely, and took steps in trying his best to correct the situation.

One of the best things about BJs and gluten is that they do their cookie desserts gluten free! Such a treat!  The atmosphere of this restaurant stays true to others in this chain. Lots of the classic big booths on the sides and tables in the middle of the rooms. I enjoy the low lighting, brick, and interesting artwork they always are designed with. I was greeted and shown to a seat on a not so busy weekday afternoon. My server came over right away and wasn't sure what I could have on the menu. The manager came over and was very helpful. Their list of official gluten free items is actually rather limited. The manager was great about seeing if her kitchen could accommodate other menu items I was interested in by simply leaving out an ingredient that would then make it gf.   I went with the southwest chicken salad which had a nice kick to it and wasn't unbelievable but overall was a pretty solid salad. Then I moved on to the star of the show, their gf pizookie covered with ice cream ... sooo delicious. Probably due to their limited menu I won't be having dinner at a BJs too often, but it's definitely my dessert scene! Food came out quickly and there was plenty of food.

The manager i spoke with was very friendly and helpful with the information I needed. When I hung up the phone I told my coworker that I could not wait to do a Yelp review of them becauseof his friendliness and because I love BJ's. Sadly that is not how this is review is going to go... My order was to be delivered between 11:15 - 11:30 and at exactly 11:23 am I recieved a call from ROTR that my order was going to be late because the restauarant was backed up and they were running behind. Strange, because they open at 11 and when I spoke with the manager at 10:30, he mentioned nothing about them being behind, he said they were working on my order.... So what happened???  The portions were inconsistant, salmon was WAY over cooked and the vegetables were dry and blah looking. Overall an incredibly lackluster experience which impacts me because the order was placed for a professional meeting and needed professional execution which I was unable to provide because of BJ's service perfomance.

Someone ordered a full rack of ribs that came with cheesy potatoes and they said they were juicy and falling off the bone good. Another got a Mediterranean deep dish pizza and thought it was really good. Someone else ordered a steak and it was cooked perfectly. And, finally, someone ordered the sliders with fries, which were disappointing and not very good. If you usually request tartar sauce with your fries you might want to skip it here.

You can get any burger with a delicious veggie patty, which is not a Boca brand patty. They have cauliflower tacos off of the lighter menu, and they are phenomenal! I only wish you had the option of getting three tacos instead of two, because man, they are good.  -BEST side salad available at any chain restaurant. It has a variety of fresh greens, croutons, and thinly sliced parmesan. Even their balsamic vinaigrette is amazing. When you get a side salad at Red Robin, it is crouton-less and has wilted iceberg lettuce. It is so much easier to eat healthier when the healthy options are this satisfying.  -Excellent non alcoholic beverages, especially their in-house root beer.  -We came here for my birthday, and I got a monkey-bread Pizooki (sp?). It was kind of like a Cinnabon a la mode. Definitely worth the splurge.  Keep up the good work, BJs! I am sad that they got rid of the super thin crispy fries, but that is my only qualm.

70,R R.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,2.0,2017-07-08,"Went in on a Friday night around 10. It wasn't that busy and we were able to find a table in the bar area right away. It took about 5 minutes to get a server to come to us and basically throw menus on the table as he rushed away. We were ready for at least some drinks...maybe ask if we want drinks before walking away? When the server finally came back around we ordered drinks, an appetizer, and meals. They were out of the beer I wanted so I ordered something else. Drinks came out and they were cold and really good. Our meals came before the appetizer, though. They asked us if we still wanted it, we said yes, and they said they would take it off our bill...no big deal it happens. But we finished our meals and still no appetizer!! We ordered a second round of drinks and the server brought me what I originally had ordered (what he said they were out of) which was a nice gesture because I really did want to try that beer. The server kept apologizing about the appetizer and we told him we didn't want it anymore (the point of an appetizer is to enjoy it over drinks while you wait for dinner). Anyway the appetizer finally came out and we sent it back. They asked us if we wanted to take it home but we had a movie to catch. Checks came out and there was an additional 20% off for the inconvenience which is greatly appreciated. However, I had 3 beers on my check and I only ordered 2! At that time we were in a hurry to get out of there. When we finally got the server's attention he seemed bothered at the situation. Excuse me, but it's not our fault you can't review your checks before dropping them off at your table. We hadn't been to BJ's in a while and this experience didn't make me miss it. The food we did get to eat was very good....still wishing I had my appetizer though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=120,2.68,2.81,2.904,1.864,2.758

Bartender didn't write down a thing. When the salad came out there qwas no shrimp on the salad. I told the Bartender she said it would be righr out. I had to ask for the salt an pepper. When the lettuce wraps arrived I reminded the bartender that I still did not have the shrimp. She said it was coming an I would not be charged. I finished the salad and the lettuce wraps still no shrimp. The bartender asked if she could remove my dishes and I reminded her I never received my shrimp. She asked if I still wanted them.

He didn't send it back because let's be honest, they would have put it under a heat lamp.  It took another 20 minutes for the rest of our food so not only did my husband have to wait after he was done eating for our food to come out, but he also had to wait until we were all done eating.  The server checked on us right after we got our food and then would walk past our table several times not even to refill our drinks.  I saw the manager check on several tables, but would literally walk past ours without so much as any acknowledgement.  The server honestly didn't deserve the less than 15% tip I left.   It is important to note that it was NOT a busy evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=80,2.44,2.76,2.888,1.8280000000000003,2.632

I loved it so much I joined the loyalty program.  I thought that they had great drinks, delightful service, and some of the most delicious pizza.  These days though that is in the past.  The greeters have no interest in making eye contact with guests and often just tell me to go to the bar instead of offering me a table even when it's not busy. The service is very hit and miss with most of the time being pretty terrible.  The menu is constantly changing. Every time I find something that I really like it I often see it removed next time I visit. Their deep dish pizzas which were once delicious are now often with very few toppings and cook too long.   Let me give you a recent example. I brought my mother here from out of town.  As usual the greeter at the front told us to go sit in the bar. We found a small table and sat there and waited for 10 minutes before anyone talked with us.   Our waitress never made eye contact with my mother the entire time.  She would not listen to my mother and often times I would have to order on behalf of my mother so that  she can get a drink refill. She never refilled her water without asking. She never checked on our table.  We often just saw her standing by the bar talking to the bartender. When the food came out it was all right. Wasn't really the highlight of my mothers trip. My mother was very offended and shocked about how she was treated as she had never been treated this way at any restaurant before.   It is very disappointing to see how BJ's has evolved over the years.

First, my meal came out at the same time as our appetizer. So after finishing the appetizer, my meal was cold so I only ate half of it. No one asked how my meal was. Then, my sisters meal was soggy. We had to ask for them to refill our waters more than once. Then, our bill was messed up twice so they had to fix it. After I gave them my card, they said it was scratched so it wouldn't work. I didn't have another form of payment, so I asked the manager if he could just type in the card numbers in the computer. He said he normally could but because of the type of card I had it could be fraudulent. So my sister had to pay for my meal. Not sure what he would have done if I was on my own and that was my only form of payment?? Then we waited 45 minutes for my sisters dessert to come out, and had to ask twice if it was still coming.

Thirty minutes later, we are still waiting. There is an empty room, towards the back, with barely anyone in there. Finally we get called, and as we sit down, we find out that they called the wrong name and we have to get up and go back to the lobby. My son was near tears, he was so hungry and frustrated. I did my best to be nice and not too annoyed. Forty-five minutes in, we are told that the table they are waiting on is just finishing dessert and paying their check. Any minute now. We inquire if there are any other tables, we are told no. Just that one. My 15 month old is starting to lose it and they bring her a plate of food - a roll and some fruit. One hour later, we are still. waiting. I get up and tell the hostess that myself, my husband and our two kids are leaving as we have been waiting over an hour for a table, and still nothing. She is very apologetic, but I'm beyond caring as my kids are starving and tired, and we have put up with this situation for longer than we should have.  My cousins decided to stay and wait for a table of four. I understand it was a Saturday, a busy time, but the fact that they didn't offer us any sort of compensation, that there was only ONE table for our group, I found that really hard to believe.

He was professional, courteous and just an all around cool dude.  He made sure we got our food and drinks promptly and when he discovered that we had the wrong drink made (by a different bartender) he immediately corrected it after apologizing sincerely. Great service! My wife and I would come back just for him! Next time you're here at the bar, ask for Joey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila,2.6,2.76,2.836,,2.696
10,Aisha A.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-20,"We came to BJ's around 3:30 or 4:00. We ordered our food at 4:30. The service was absolutely slow & terrible. We waited for our food for up to an hour& some of us had to wait longer. We had kids & they were complaining about how hungry they were. WE SPENT 4 HOURS!!!! One of my family members complained & the manger was very loud & immature. She made excuses & she kept screaming ""what do you want me to do?"". She said the services was slow cause of football, but we came an hour before football. She kept making excuses. As a manger you are suppose to be professional & own up to your mistake & apology to the customer. The customer is always right. I love BJ's but this is the worst BJ's ever. I recommend BJ's but not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40,2.44,2.74,2.824,,2.62

Once we finally sat down, we waited another hour for our food to actually arrive. I don't know if the food here is worth a two hour wait, but it was really good. I had a burger, which was decent. However, the desert is to die for. I had one of the pizza cookies with ice cream and oh my gosh it was heaven in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila,2.56,2.77,2.828,,2.686

No dressing on my salad which I specified 2 extra under the special requests section at time of check out . And after getting back to the office which is 2 min away my food has been cold  and burned like it had been waiting for 20 or so min! Probably won't order curbside again! This was horrible ! Talked to Jennifer the manager which was so helpful and solved the problem!

Not only was the food not the least bit satisfaction my server Crane S. Could not have been any Ruder when I tried to explain to him what was wrong with my meal he threw his hands on the air and said I will get my manager.

55,Val K.,"Kent, WA",0,20,3.0,4.0,2017-12-17,"We had a company Christmas party in their patio section that was reserved just for us. There were heaters to keep us warm, and it was nice because it was away from the main area at the restaurant so our party could have some privacy and be as loud as we wanted. We had the buffet style dinner since there were about 20 of us. All of the food was delicious and was just about ready for us when all of us had arrived. The Caesar salad was fresh, the deep dish pizzas were sooo good, and my favorite was the crusted chicken Parmesan that was so Delicious. The servers were great even though all of us had our own alcohol tab. You could tell they have been around a few large parties before. All in all, not a bad spot to have a larger group dinner. I was pleasantly surprised .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila,2.76,2.74,2.824,,2.748
147,Denise A.,"Shelton, WA",0,3,4.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"My friend had taken me here last night for the first time and I was very excited. But for some reason , some of the staff weren't so great. There was someone  cleaning the revolving door at the entrance so it took us a minute to figure out  if the place was still open or not since there were not many people inside .  It was about 10pm when we got there so we thought "" hm weird , thought they opened till midnight "". But my friend all of the sudden saw customers inside still eating , so he figured  they were still open. We were in the middle of still deciding wether to come in or not when the staff who was cleaning the door  glared at us then gave us the "" shrug"" almost like she was upset. It was so weird . Then I saw her say something to the hostess then they both glared at us . My friend and I were so confused because at this point it was just really awkward . So when we finally went through the revolving door  and were inside the restaurant , we kindly tried to explain to her why we were looking inside from the outside because we thought they were closed. But she went on and gave us an attitude saying "" YEAH WE ARE STILL OPEN"" not even making eye contact as she proceeded to clean the door Again.  So we kinda just smiled and walked up to hostess feeling even more weird . When we got up to the hostess , it was just a very weird vibe. You know when you're in a place and people treat you crappy and make you feel u wanted  ? Yes, it felt like that . My friend and I were so confused at this point because we couldn't figure out what we did wrong for them to treat us this way right on the spot. We didn't get a "" welcome or a Hi Hello there"". But at this point we didn't really care anymore because our expectations were already low. So my friend  told her table for two please . Then She told us "" if you're over 21(which we are) , u guys can sit at the bar. Go straight and it'll be on ur left hand side "" in the most unwelcoming approach ever  . So we just didn't say anything and followed what she told us to do. When we finally sat down , my friend and I finally discussed about the whole situation. We were still very confused, there was no need for those unwelcoming Rude vibes we got  when we walked in. But thankfully our server was sooo KINDD. She was very very pleasant , gosh I wish I remembered her name. She made up for all those BS. So I thank her very much! So for all the people planning on going here after 10pm, goooodddd luck lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=60,2.8,2.74,2.824,,2.7640000000000002

40,Krystin T.,"Seattle, WA",101,400,,3.0,2017-12-30,"My husband and I ended up meeting a friend here not long ago. We'd been trying to go somewhere else but that place was a 45-mimute wait, so we ended up ar BJ's because it's always a good standby.  I actually find the food tasty, which it seems some other reviewers don't. I've never had anything I thought was bad; this time I had the basic burger with a veggie patty + cheese. It and the accompanying fries were great. My husband had the fried chicken salad and seemed to enjoy it. Our friend ordered the hot wings and complained that they were not, in fact, hot. We also shared some cheese curds which were fine to me but as our friend pointed out, they weren't hot and melty like they are at some places. My main issue, if you can call it that, was the service. Our server was pleasant but nothing made it to us especially quickly. My husband and our friend also ordered calimari which just...never came. I had to ask twice for water and condiments. Appetizers (the cheese curds) came out after our entrees. Nothing horrendous but just not the most amazing service one could have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila,2.88,2.78,2.836,,2.82

47,Kellen W.,"Cheney, WA",104,55,38.0,4.0,2018-01-07,"Through all my experiences here, overall the food is good but the service can be hit or miss. If you have never been to a BJ's, it is a much classier and higher quality restaurant than something like Red Robbin, but I wouldn't think of it as a high class restaurant. Being a Brewhouse, they have their own beers available - and from what I've had they are all pretty good, nothing I would complain about. They have a pretty wide range of food available on their menu, everything from burgers, sandwiches, salads, Mediterranean tacos, and chicken rice pilaf. With the range of food there is definitely something for everybody, and they do have a lighter portion of the menu. We have enjoyed visiting during their lunch hours because of their specials and lunch combos. And of course, it's pretty hard to beat their dessert. If you have never had a pizzookie before, it's something you must try. It's a large, slightly undercooked cookie of your choice, served in a pan and topped with ice cream. Probably one of my favorite desserts of all time. We have had some problems in the past with their service. I don't think it has to do with how busy they are, because we have had servers even at lunch where it can be hard just to find them and get water filled among other things. However that hasn't stopped us from going back, and it's something that easy to pick because of their wide menu selection. The biggest downside to their restaurant is that it's at the South Center mall, so parking can be a real pain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila,2.92,2.77,2.828,,2.83
