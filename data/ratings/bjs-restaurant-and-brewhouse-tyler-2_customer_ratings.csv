The next afternoon, I was back in Tyler and nursing a severe ""headache"" and ""sour stomach.""  Remembering my friend's CFS, I thought, ""That is just what I need.""  And it was.  The double patty was filling, and the meat inside was tender.  The crust could have been seasoned a bit more, but there was salt and pepper on the table.  And the cream gravy was very good.  Only complaint was that the mixed vegetables were frozen, but I didn't come back for the mixed vegetables.  And no beer this time!!!

They just tasted like fried avocados that came with an extremely sugary sauce.  The beer was not too bad. The nutty brown had a great flavor profile and the Irish red was smooth and delicious.  I had a gluten free pizza. Kudos to the crust for being pretty edible. I know it's hard to do, but the sauce wasn't very good and they forgot to put roasted garlic on.  The service could use some work. Christopher was trying, but doesn't quite understand the steps of service. This could be a lack of training on the restaurants part, which I fully understand. Let alone the large gaps in time between table visits, we had empty glasses and plates sitting around and after he came to ask us if the food was alright I had to prompt him as he walked away to take the empty glasses and things to free up space.

5,Eric T.,"Fort Worth, TX",687,815,2089.0,3.0,2015-07-11,"I've heard about the BJ's chain for quite some time, so I decided that during my brief trip into Tyler, I would try it out. In trying this brand for the first time, I left the location neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed. It was sort of a ""meh"" experience.  THE GOOD: Customer service was really good. The hostess informed me that she would seat me with her best server, of which I agreed that the server was cool & attentive, for the most part. There was one moment where it took her nearly 8 minutes to bring me a glass of ice water due to me biting into a pepper, yet I let it go when I noticed that she had a large table of 8 guests that required 8 drinks + my water on a tray. Yes, I was empathetic toward her current situation. The decor of BJ's was nice. Certainly a place that I would bring my wife to, considering that the artwork looked really good, in addition to the color scheme throughout the venue. Not your typical bar restaurant, that's for sure. THE SO-SO: I'm a major IPA draft brew drinker, and I know a good one when I taste it. The IPA that I had on this evening was so-so: hoppy, yes. But the expected bite: not the best, yet not terrible either. It just didn't leave me excited to order another one. If I like a brew, I usually order 2-3. For tonight, it was one, which is a rarity for me. To top that off, I also enjoy Hefeweizen brews (thank you, Gordon Biersch), which is a German wheat-type of brew. To say the least, the Hefeweizen served at this location was not very good. In fact, it totally sucked. I was grateful for my server in giving me a sample of it first. I couldn't even finish half of the sample, considering that I felt a headache coming on. Yeah, that bad. I'm pretty sure the little man in the freezer had an off-day when it came to tapping the beer kegs today. SMH. The entree of the California flat bread was not bad. I was hungry, so I was not terribly picky about it. But one thing that I noticed was that the flat bread was more chewy as opposed to crunchy. Flat breads usually have a texture to that of a saltine cracker. This flat bread tasted more like a Domino's Pizza thin-crust pizza that was left on the kitchen's heat lamp for 15 minutes. I appreciated the server for not charging me for avocado slices on my flat bread, yet even with that, I thought that it was ""meh."" But again, I was hungry, and didn't have that ""I need a Snickers Bar moment"" by being overly too critical. Altogether, I would have to give either this BJs or another one a second try to have a full appreciation of what they offer. For this evening, it wasn't the best, yet not the worst either. It was just ""meh.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.468,3.2000000000000006

But the dipping sauce was sugary greatness, so we ate those, while watching other tables of very casually dressed individuals get down on various sundays and cheesecakes.  This is a place where I hope no one eats too often...
