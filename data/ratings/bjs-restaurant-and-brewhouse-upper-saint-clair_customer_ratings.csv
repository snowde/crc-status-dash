24,Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",355,771,3128.0,3.0,2016-08-09,"For those of you tired of going to the North Hills BJ's has now opened a second location on the grounds of the South Hills Village mall near Jared's. When I arrived I was greeted warmly and i got to meet the manager. The place was wide open so I could seat either at their craft draft bar or at a table. I opted for a table. The waitress and her assistance went over their points program where you install their mobile app you get VIP treatment. According to the brochure the app allows you to get on their preferred waitlist, order ahead of time, receive special offers, pay directly from the app, and earn points. Since they just opened on 8-8-16 I was told that if I download their app I was entitled to a free mini pizooke which is really a type of warmed cookie covered by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So I did this and created an account. They explained to me their history and then told me they were especially known for their pizza and craft brewery.  I decided to order a lunch special which they call lemon thyme chicken. It comes on a bed of rice and some vegetables including tomatoes and brussel sprouts. They even give you a tablespoon along with your regular utensils. When I got it I noticed it was lukewarm so I had it sent back and got a whole new entree. It was very good and quite filling. The place has free Wi Fi but for some reason I was having a little difficulty with it. Nevertheless I ordered my pizooke where you have a choice a caramel cookie, chocolate chip or peanut butter and covered with ice cream. Since it was a mini it was a generous portion size for me and more than enough. The cookie literally melted in your mouth since it was heated. The ice cream is your standard vanilla. Nothing overly exciting about it. They do have an extensive menu and a listing of all the craft beers on the wall for you to choose from.I do like the fact that they offer more of a variety than a competeter in the mall. I also noticed as I was leaving the place was filling up fairly quickly. It may be because they are new but they do offer some variation to what this mall needs in terms of restaurants. I was grateful for a new place to go next time I visit. Please note that it is not located in the mall itself but towards the right side in the parking lot. I would imagine it is similar to the one currently open in McCandless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
85,Jason H.,"Bethel Park, PA",1,31,,1.0,2016-08-13,"I have heard good things but unfortunately, after waiting for an hour we left hungry.  I did call ahead seating and arrived 10 minutes later to let the hostess know we arrived.  She said it would be 15 minutes.  After a half hour, I was told 15 more minutes, 20 minutes later I was told another 15 minutes.  At this point we had a one year old and a four year old that needed dinner and left for Primanti's.   The frustrating part is that it was not overly crowded and everyone else was getting seated.  I am convinced the hostess did not mark us down as having arrived until the second time I talked to her.  It was nice that they brought around samples (which were amazing), but there are definitely some bugs to be worked out of the process.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=60,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

84,Rugger W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,45,,2.0,2016-08-21,"We have been here twice since the restaurant opened.  There were high points and low points to each visit.  On the positive side, the pizzas (both thin and thick) are quite good in our opinion.  On both occasions, we had brussel sprouts that were nice too.  Unfortunately, there were some drawbacks.  On the first visit, multiple beers were unavailable due to temperature issues.  It's great that they want to maintain standards, but it was nonetheless disappointing since it is a brewhouse and a driving factor to try their establishment.  What a let down.   While on the first visit, our exceptional server (Marissa) mentioned their app which included a waitlist feature.  I downloaded and utilized it for the second trip.  When our info. was entered at 6:28, the app indicated an approximate 40 minute wait.  My wife and I proceeded to check in as instructed with the hostess at approx. 6:55 and were told that we would be seated in approximately 20 minutes.  This, of course, seemed reasonable - especially hearing the party in front of us (also a group of two) were quoted an 80 minute wait time.  Long story short, the waitlist app feature was worthless.  We were not seated until after 8:00.  In fact, the couple in front of us with a quoted wait time of 80 minutes had a table before us! While the food was good, the front of the house management - specifically related to the waitlist - was below expectations.  I don't know if we will or will not frequent the establishment in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=60,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

First off, the atmosphere is very nice and it has a nice casual feel to it. They have a huge menu of food options! I got the Mediterranean chicken pita and it was delicious. The potato skins are so good! Usually, I just take the cheese, bacon, scallions, etc off the top and skip the potato. At BJ's they double crisp the potatoes....AMAZING! The pizookie is incredible! If you're on a diet, it's totally worth breaking it for day! The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean establishment! I definitely will be returning! I love how close it is as well!

89,Tom M.,"Canonsburg, PA",1,19,,2.0,2016-09-01,"Went here earlier this week and it was okay. Not great...okay. Prices are reasonable. Service (particularly the bar) was a bit slow and maybe you can chalk that up to being new. I had the Jambalaya which would have been good except it was terribly over spices. I like spicy....this was terribly overspiced. My companion had the shrimp and penne which he said was okay. Again, not great or good....ok.  On the positive the wine prices were pretty good especially by the bottle....and some good IPA's.  Very open place which makes it very loud.

111,Jordan J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,11,,2.0,2016-09-01,"I have never eaten at a BJs, and was especially excited for their Deep Dish, since Pittsburgh is known for their local Pizza, but has very few Deep Dish options. Online takeout was fast and easy. That was about the end of the positives. After reading reviews, I ordered a medium Deep Dish with Extra sauce because I read it can be dry. They either forgot the extra sauce or the original has none. It was no more than a dab of tomato sauce on each slice. It also had very little cheese. What was left tasted like a dry, flavorless Pizza Hut Pan. I've been to Chicago/NYC several times, and this is no way a traditional Deep Dish by any means. It shouldn't even be labeled as such. Burgh's Pizza makes a Deep Dish that is far superior and is a short drive away. Disappointed.

With this location being new they may just have a few kinks to work out, but both times we have gone we waited at least 15 minutes before being acknowledged by waitstaff and taking our drink order. I watched a few tables near us actually get up and leave. Also both times are appetizers came out after our meals. I am not going to write BJs off just yet because as I said earlier the food is good and the food and drink menu is huge!

Waited over an hour and 45 minutes and still no table ready.

The server was very attentive.  My friend ordered the Ahi tuna Salad and said it was really good as well.   The bad was the beer. Now I will admit I'm more critical than most with beer since I'm more of a beer nerd.  I was excited to try their home brews but those every was terrible especially the Porter.  None of them had any taste.  The Porter literally tasted like colored water.  One of the only times I can remember not being able to finish a beer. It was quite disappointing since this was a brew house.  I will go back and try it again as maybe the problem will be fixed as they just opened up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=40,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

93,Nicole B.,"Hollywood, CA",3,31,141.0,3.0,2016-09-09,"Great layout, tasty looking menu, creative drinks, friendly staff, but but needs just a little fine tuning on operation. Bj's has been open at this location for aprox a month and I think it will be extremely popular once they're rolling. Experience: We received prompt seating at 4pm in a nice, large booth facing all of the sports games (which was perfect). Our server was friendly and sweet. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and soup salad combos. We requested our food to be ""coursed"": app first, then salad, then soup after salad so that the soup wouldn't get cold while we were eating everything else (this has happened to me before and so I was specific about it). *This didn't happen.  The app came out extremely hot and so we had to wait for it to cool. We didn't mind that, but then our soup and salads arrived together....and we weren't finished with the app and the soup was warm, not hot, which meant it went cold by the time we were finished with our salads...which is why I asked for it to be timed out. Nobody wants to eat cold clam chowder. The timing of the food was disappointing. *Side note: They need to check the silverware before wrapping it. Food: The artichoke app was slightly briny but ok. House salad was delicious with fresh greens and veggies and I really like the balsamic dressing (ask for it on the side). The Caesar salad was way over dressed. I'm not exaggerating, we didn't finish it. The clam chowder had nice flavor and we would order it again. However, I would want it to be a good temp instead of warm to cold. *Tip: No bread, crackers, or anything served with it, so you may want to order it in a bread bowl if you're looking for that. The Smores Pizookie came out perfect. I like that they offer a Pizookie Trio so that you can try more than one kind if you choose.  They have daily deals and the servers should offer those when giving you the menu's. It makes you wonder if the staff gets to do menu tasting so that they can let you know what's their favorites are or what's popu We'll be back because we see the potential and know they just opened and it takes time to perfect things. I am detailed in this review in hopes that they will make adjustments because I really like the place. Not to be harsh. I would give it 3 1/2 stars and my relative said 3 stars.  Another user wrote that if you check in on Yelp that you get a free Pizookie or App...I checked in, but didn't get that notification/ offer...disappointing :(.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=60,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

112,Marilou R.,"Tybee Island, GA",0,3,,1.0,2016-09-20,"One star is generous for this place. It was new and clean. That's where it ends. Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and left mid meal. I had to ask 2 other waiters to find my soup order. Even though menu is extensive we had the basics. Caesar salad was made with ice burg (who does that?) the clam chowder was pastie and overly salted. The signature ""new sandwich"" was simply a variety of meat on soggy bread. No flavor and dry. Very underwhelmed. Lastly, after our original waitress left, we were pretty much on our own & even had to request to pay our check.

I know that's not what you think someone would recommend from a pizza place, but the chicken in it is so well prepared and the dressing and mandarin orange slices make it pretty perfect. The salad and pizookie were still wonderful, as was the rest of the food our party ordered. I'm sure their pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers are all still really good here. If it were closer, I'm sure I'd go more frequently.  The cider they make was very good, as were the beers ordered in our party.  There's no sign that faces the street, but BJ's is the red building up and to the left of Bonefish as you're looking at the buildings from 19.

56,Alexis Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,52,8.0,1.0,2016-10-27,"First Visit:  Good and bad!  First the good: Food was delicious, servers were very nice and bubbly. We ordered the ribs (had a good bit of meat on them, and good sauce), the pasta with blackened chicken (very flavorful), baked potatoes (cooked well and came with sour cream, butter, scallions). Many options for everyone on the menu and even some options I haven't seen at other restaurants before!  Second the bad: The servers did not check on us much, the food took about 45 minutes to come out once we finally got to order, which shouldn't have taken that long because we came after the dinner rush to avoid that specifically. The app you can download gives you good rewards but only if you pay using the app, which we would never put our card info in to an app. The rewards should be for any regular paying customer.. Not happy about that.  Would recommend! Food was worth it& menu selection was great.  Second Visit:  Wait was not long. The beers were good but service was bad. This is the second time the service has been crappy. The waitress never checked in, she would disappear when asked for something. Had to wait about 20 minutes every time we wanted ranch, beer, anything really. My brisket burger came without the burger the first time, looked great though and the waitress let me keep the brisket sand which. When she brought out my actual sandwich, I was confused as to what was on the burger. The brisket looked nothing like what was on the previous sandwich and was actually gross looking, they were not the same brisket. I ended up scraping it off my sandwich and using the other brisket. We will be back because of beer and to try other food selections, but don't expect good service here apparently!  Third Visit:  Three strikes and you're out, won't be returning. My experiences seem to get worse each time, we have given this place three tries now. Wait was long, which is fine. Finally got seated and waited forever for anyone to come to our table. Our waitress was a blonde and very unprofessional and not experienced at all. She took forever to bring even our waters out. The service is always horrible and they are not nice either.. usually the food is alright, but I was very disappointed with my fatty burger. She charged our bill all wrong and split it wrong as well. She brought the wrong beer out after saying one was available and then told us we were wrong about her saying that and that she never said it was available. She got extremely defensive and was rude about it.  Don't recommend.. I'm all for giving places lots of patience and multiple tries, but this place has failed me every time I come.

Some of the Pros: - Excellent beer selection. - A Variety of items to choose from on the menu. - Reasonably priced. - Large seating area. - Friendly staff (that I dealt with) Some Cons: - With this being a new location and new staff, they seemed to be still learning the menu and drinks. (Should know both fully before completely opening). - Music selection while eating was poor.  Other than that it was a great experience. I got the brisket burger and it was really good with alot of flavor and their endless fries (I do not eat fries often) are really good, but they are salty. We also got the Sriracha queso with chips and let me tell you, that for $5.XX it was well worth it for 2 people and they have endless chips also. The queso was very good and just a hint of spice.

We've gone a few times because we really enjoy the food, however the service is always so horrible. We recently went to the BJs in the South Hills and I was interested in seeing if our experience would be different. It wasn't. The service was super slow and inattentive. We never got our appetizer. Had to ask for a refill from the bar several times and soft drinks/water cups ran dry without refills. They brought out the wrong flavor boneless wings, then charged us for both when we asked to keep the mistake wings since they would just be wasted anyway. We asked to speak with a manager after the waitress told us she wasn't allowed to take it off the bill, and the manager was very short with us. She did take the charge off our bill, but you could tell she just didn't want to deal with us. As a chain restaurant, you'd think they'd have the management and service down pat, but that just isn't the case with BJs. We've now been to two of these restaurants and both had the same poor service. Since this has been our experience across two restaurants and perhaps 6 visits, this issue is a management issue, not a server issue. They are either too short staffed for the number of tables they have or aren't giving their servers adequate training.

I ordered the grilled rather than the blackened salmon, but it was charred and was like eating  salmon  taxidermy.

46,Andrew Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,2016-12-27,"Wow! I moved out of Bethel Park a few years ago and came back into town to visit for the holidays. At my dad's recommendation, we checked this place out. Boy we're we disappointed! Let me count the ways: - Shortly after we received our drinks, as we were looking through the menu, my stepmother spilled a little bit of her drink. When she asked the waitress for a napkin, motioning towards the few drops that had spilled on her menu, the waitress declined to bring them, saying that it was no big deal. So my stepmother sat there with a wet lap.  - When our appetizer (chips with sriracha cheese) came, the cheese was so cold that there was a layer congealed on the top. Since we'd still not been brought napkins or silverware or plates, we ate it hunched over the middle of the table.  - My dad is lactose intolerant, and he even had a brief conversation with the waitress in which she explained that she didn't eat cheese either. As such, he ordered his burger with no cheese. But even despite this conversation his burger arrived covered in cheddar. The runner (notably NOT our waitress, who at this point we had not seen in some time) apologized and said that they would have a new one out in a few minutes. When we finally caught the waitress, she told us that she had pressed the wrong button on the screen. - I ordered the vegetarian pita, and the pita was so dry that it broke into tiny pieces as soon as I picked it up. So that became a fork meal. - My stepmother's mushroom salad came with no dressing whatsoever. Her burger was cold and the fries were burnt to the consistency of potato chips--and no warmer! - My stepmother and I were completely finished eating by the time my dad got his burger, and yet all of the plates remained on our table until shortly before the waitress brought the check. It was at this point that she asked how everything was, and I explained a few of our issues. - When she finally brought the check, the waitress engaged us in a long conversation (by far the most time she had spent at our table all night) about how she had to make her car payments, etc.--clearly to ""suck up"" and try to recoup some of her tip. She also told us that she had removed the pita and chips from the bill...but in reviewing it I discovered that she had even mixed that up, and in fact she'd removed the chips and the salad. Better than nothing, I guess! I absolutely understand that kitchens get busy and people make mistakes, but the fact that literally every dish we received was problematic strikes me as a little overboard. Despite this fact, because my dad and stepmother are great people, we tipped 20%. But I can say with certainty that none of us will visit this place again. Although I doubt that matters much, because BJ's is very clearly a quantity-over-quality type of establishment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.8200000000000003,2.72

Finalllllly I went online and noticed you could reserve a spot from online IFFFF you signed up for rewards program. (all of this just to reserve a spot lol) The website gives you no est. time so we eventually went there. They had no info of us even reserving a spot. lol what a fail. The wait was an hour, so we headed over to South Hills Village to shop & browse while we waited. we decided on drinks and apps. I went with the avocado eggrolls. They were fabulous! Gosh I wish I had their recipe. My bf went with wings. You get 10 wings for about $10.50. not the best deal but whatever. You can also choose boneless (1lb for same price). We went with the buffalo sauce. The wings were excellent.  Since I signed up online for rewards program, I was given a free pizookie, which is a dessert such as cookie, brownie or monkey bread in a dish with ice cream. I went with monkey bread and it was delicious.  For drinks, we went with a mojito. It was very fresh and tasted great. Our server was Chelsea and she did an ok job. The atmosphere was cool and food was good. We will be back for sure.. maybe even the North Hills location (McCandless Crossing) Their rewards program gives you 1 point for every dollar spent (before taxes and tip of course). For signing up you get a free pizookie. At 75 pts you get $5 off food and eventually prizes are $10 and $25 off of food. If you plan on eating here more than once, might as well sign up for rewards.

61,Manuel T.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,4,,1.0,2017-02-25,"This was the 4th time we've been to BJ's and this place continues to disappoint.  Previous visits have been passable or just so-so.  Tonight can only be called terrible.   Here's why... First, there is an exceedingly long wait just to get seated.  Tonight took about an hour and a half and using their app to get a place in line is useless.  The BJ's app only puts your name on a list at the door but does not secure a spot in the queue as does restaurant's that use the NoWait app. The long wait might be understandable if BJ's was a unique place to go but it's not.  There are several craft brew places that serve food around the South Hills with new ones opening all the time.  There are a lot of choices available out here offering the same repertoire of food and drink. Secondly, the time it takes to get your food after ordering is ridiculously long.  Our order wasn't complicated.  We didn't order appetizers or adult beverages, only the entrees.  It took approximately 45 minutes to get an order of Fish Tacos and Fish and Chips.  The waiter was apologetic about the delay and sent the manager to the table.  We hadn't complained about the wait but the waiter realized it was excessive.  Maybe chewing the ice cubes from our drinks while tapping our fingers on the table was a clue? When our food did arrive, it was lukewarm at best.  The wilted lettuce garnish leads me to believe it had sat under a warming lamp for a while.  I was highly unimpressed.  To make up for the delay in getting served, we were offered a comp dessert, their ""Pizookie.""  We weren't expecting that and thanked them.   And we started waiting AGAIN! Finally, after waiting another 15 minutes for the ""Pizookies"" to arrive, and they never did, we got up and left.  I don't get how it takes that long to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie.  I guess I'll never find anything out. Thankfully, we could pay the check electronically.  I would not have wanted to see how long it took to get our bill but I'm sure that is the one thing you'll get quickly. So with the long delays in getting your food, it's no wonder why it takes so long just to get seated.  These delays essentially blew the rest of the evening as we were there much longer than we could have imagined for what was ""bar food"" where the quality is concerned.   We won't be going back and if you are on a schedule, as going to dinner and a movie, go somewhere else or you'll be really late...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9480000000000004,3.3600000000000003

There is typically a wait since most shoppers are stopping in on their way through the mall. There is an extensive menu so the good news is that you'll find something for even the pickiest of eaters. Best part - kids get a cup of fruit and garlic roll for free. We have gone 2-3 times and, each time, I feel my sodium intake has gone through the roof. The food is incredibly salty! If you're used to food cooked with a lot of salt, you probably won't mind. But if you're someone who steers away from a high-sodium diet, you'll probably feel it.  I probably won't actively go to BJs again, and if I do I'll stick to a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.1760000000000006,3.2400000000000007
22,Cara G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,76,55.0,1.0,2017-02-28,"Really - this should have 1.5 stars, but I can't figure out how to make that happen.  Wow, I thought this place had a ton of potential, but it didn't deliver at all. Almost everything that could go wrong did. Orders were wrong or missing altogether, completely inattentive servers, non-existent manager, long wait for everything!  They don't take reservations. So our very large table (family event) had to wait a while (hour). No big deal. We got drinks at the bar and all was well.  The wait was the most pleasant portion of the meal. I liked the cider - crisp and just a little sweet, but very drinkable.  It is the only thing that would round this up to 1.5... When we were finally seated, someone came over and got our drinks.  We waited a while longer and finally were able to place our orders for appetizers and the rest of our food - and a request for napkins & silverware.  Following another long wait, the apps came.  Our ""queso"" dip (really just nacho cheese) wasn't very warm and neither were the chips, but it was fine and at this point, we were so hungry it didn't matter (it had been about an hour wait to sit down).  We still didn't have napkins or silverware and had to flag down multiple servers in our attempts to get these essentials. They finally bring those out after the salads (and our 4 request/reminder).  Now came another long wait (hour)... eventually, runners started bringing out our food, one by one.  Almost everyone had their food (except for one of my cousins - more about that later) and had started eating.  I flipped open my veggie burger.  And there is bacon on it.  I've been a vegetarian for about 3 years now and definitely didn't order bacon with my veggie burger.  I did however order avocado, which I never received.  I decided to eat a fry since I obviously was going to need to talk to someone about my burger - the fries are cold. My cousin next to me had ordered fries as well, but didn't get them at all - so I shared my giant portion of fries with him.  I never received any condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc) nor was I able to ask for these as the servers appeared to be actively avoiding our table.  After waiting and being ignored by multiple members of the wait staff, I decide to make a bad decision and try to remove the bacon from my burger - so off goes the cheese as it has melted together - and I hope that's enough to keep me from getting sick (I'm a vegetarian for health reasons).   Across the table from me, my cousin (who I mention before) ended up waiting 40 minutes for his food after the rest of the table received theirs.  That only appeared because we finally were able to flag down our waitress.  I was able to mention my issue with the bacon to her - her reaction was that it wasn't that big of a deal (vague ""oh, I'm sorry"" was all I originally got), but eventually decided the right thing to do would be to comp my meal.  They did offer to make me another one, but I just didn't want to wait another 45 minutes or so, since the first one took so long!   I never was able to speak with a manager nor was one offered (to be fair, I didn't explicitly ask for one either). I just wanted to be done. It's a shame - my family only gets together about once a month and we spent most of the time talking about how bad the service was at this location of BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-upper-saint-clair?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.0440000000000005,3.1600000000000006

That says a lot because she never says that, so it has that going for it. I had the brewhouse burger. I was kinda miffed because I failed to notice that it didn't come with cheese.

The waitresses and managers were very polite. We had several managers check on us throughout our time there. They have a pretty big menu, so it was hard to decide what to order. I opted for the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. It comes with meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had them hold the meatballs on mine.

Finally, I had the opportunity and I would say for the food and experience I had, it was literally ""A-OK"". Why?  My friends were waiting for me when I arrived. The waiter was quick to notice my arrival and instantly came over to ask for my drink order. He proceeded to ask if we were ready to order and of course, I needed some time to decide what my dinner was going to be. Well, it took him another 20-25 minutes to return and ask a second time. This was the case all night. The waiter was very nice but the service was slow and the place wasn't as busy (especially with a Pens game on) as my friends are used to (who are regulars).  Despite being advised to try the Chicken Tortilla Soup from a friend, I took the advice of the waiter and tried the Broccoli Cheddar Soup, pairing it with a Caesar Salad for the soup/salad combo. I can say that this soup is not something I will order again. The color alone was off-putting and it was lacking broccoli and excessive with cheese. The salad was heavily dressed but for a Caesar, I am satisfied with that. My friend offered me a slice of the pepperoni supreme and I took him up on it - thick, bubbly, and tasty! I would definitely try pizza again (especially with their Monday night deal). This place contains adequate seating with booths, tables, and a nice sized bar. TVs are located on every wall, making it easy to check the score of the game at any point. I thought that the atmosphere was quite loud, especially if it wasn't as full as it typically is. There is adequate parking in front of the restaurant and more can be found in the shopping center if need be.  I truly believe I can have a better experience when I return to BJ's. There are so many options on the menu, including beer that they brew themselves, and I am willing to try other items they offer.

30,Erik H.,"Washington, PA",2,45,99.0,3.0,2017-07-31,"Friday night we hit up BJ's Brew House. Sometimes you just need a beer. We arrived around 6PM and put our name in. We were told it would be about an hour wait. No problem. We headed to the bar and ended up standing and having a beer until a seat had opened up at the bar. We ended up just staying at the bar and eating as we were both hungry and generally just wanted to unwind. I had the Tatonka Stout which was a really nice beer. BJ's brews a pretty solid dark beer that's actually not overly bitter, but still has some flavor.  For an appetizer we shared some of the boneless wings. Theirs are actually pretty good and not over cooked. Sometimes restaurants just fry the life out of them.  By then we were on our second round of beers, and I had their other dark beer the the Nutty Brewnette which is pretty damn refreshing for a dark ale.  We ended up sharing a medium BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Everything on the pizza was great. Crust tasted good, veggies were fresh, wasn't greasy at all, but it was dry. Dry as a bone. It was desperately in need of some sauce. It wasn't as good as the pizza we'd had there when they first opened, but it was okay. We ended up having another drink and headed home after that. Would I return to BJ's for a drink and food? Sure. We had a good time. I'd just make sure I asked for a little extra sauce on the pizza next time.

Now I think it will be a long time before either of us returns. Granted it was busy Sat. night. They  brought her drink 5 mins before mine. The runners brought her salad but totally the wrong the for me and I had to wait for them to bring out my salad and fries. Fries were borderline warm and hard and I had to wait for the mayo I asked for, By the time I got that they were a loss.  The waitress had a good excuse for not bringing the mayo tho as she was so busy fixing our salad orders.  I ordered a santa-fe salad with dressing on the side as I have food allergies. The salad came an unlisted seasoning powder all over the salad. I had to send it back. It was also missing the avocado and had very little cheese.  I was already a little peeved as I could not eat any of meat add ons and they insisted on charging full price. I had them bring the meat separate so that my friend could add it to her salad and it's a good thing they did. Her salad was missing the chicken that was to be on it. She ordered the asian chopped salad that was not chopped. Along with missing chicken, it also was missing almonds, mandarin oranges and dressing! Close to 2 hrs and a talk with the manager resulted in new salads, (mine still had very little cheese or avocado) and new fries which were not much better hot as they were greasy and had a funny coating on them.  As a side note: I disliked the ambiance.

20,Matt B.,"Washington, PA",5,34,,5.0,2017-08-24,"I'm not a giant fan of chains, especially places like this where it is always busy and everyone is either frazzled or waiting for food. But the staff at the SHV BJ's Brewhouse keep things under control with ease and calmness. We've been to the location countless times before and there is rarely an issue. My favorite is the California chicken club sandwich, but the deep-dish pizza is always quite good, especially when it's half off on Mondays. But this place has a giant menu. Very little of it is health food, but you sort of know that when you walk in. They have lots of great beer on tap and even house-made sodas. Their signature dessert, the pizookie is also worth a look. I got a free one for signing up for their loyalty program and haven't looked back since. The reason I chose to leave a review today is because there was a problem with our order. A friend and I had some substitutions. Manager Audrey  came out and immediately made things right and held a conversation with us like we'd all been friends for years. The bill was properly adjusted and our replacement food was out in no time. Because of Audrey's friendly and professional attitude, we didn't even mind waiting a little longer. Props also go out to waitress Tawnya, who handled the situation calmly and professionally too.  It's a 5-star review because I've been to many restaurants where when a problem occurs, the staff handles everything in a lousy way. But the people at this BJ's want you to walk out happy.

She was attentive and answered my million questions I had about the food.  The beers are always Ok here. I am not amazed by any that I've had. For an appetizer we had chicken pot stickers which were yummy because typically those are hard to find. Almost all the appetizers here will run you about $9-$11 dollars which is pretty crazy for a small appetizer. For dinner I had the turkey dip. So good! Again this is not something you typically see.

It's part of the rewards programs perks that you can gift some of your points to another person. There are many websites, and groups where people share their rewards with others. I am part of many such groups.  I had gone to this establishment, and cashed in many of my gifted points on 6 different occasions without issue.  On the last trip, the manager shamed my son for cashing in loyalty points rather than paying him in cash for the order. He then cancelled my sons loyalty account, as well as mine, and my husbands.  The manager felt that since WE didn't earn the points, he had the right to take them away. He didn't. Those points were EARNED by many other people across the US who were kind enough to share them.  By deleting the points, he was saying that the hundreds of dollars these people had been spending to earn those points didn't matter.  I see what he did as theft.  He took EARNED points (used like gift cards) that weren't his, and three them away.

They have a ""preferred waitlist"" that serves basically no function. You put your name on a virtual list using their app, yet it essentially does nothing. Multiple times I've gone with my family for dinner and we've had to just leave because of the wait. The app will give you an estimated wait time, but the time doesn't actually start until you get to the restaurant - which makes no sense. It's really a shame because the wide assortment of food and great beers would have me eating there a few times per week - if I could get in. So my best advice?
