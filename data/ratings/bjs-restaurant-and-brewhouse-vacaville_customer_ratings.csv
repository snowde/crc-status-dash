After telling our waitress we were in a rush, she said she'd do her best to get our order right away. I got a turkey burger with fries and my cousin got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The turkey burger was very juicy and topped with lots of avocado.  My cousin's BBQ pulled pork sandwich was a little salty, and the BBQ sauce wasn't sweet enough to complement the pork. Although the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was disappointing, their homemade orange cream soda was great!

Had great service this last visit, one of the 1st times we had a server that was on top our drinks and gave us updates on our food order. I would give five starts but the manager was kind of a prick. I was ordering my meal (we had a party of five) and as I was ordering a bus boy ran by and nailed the side of my head, so hard that I had to stop ordering and re gather my self, the waitress was very understanding but the bus boy was like ""oops and just keep running"" totally an asshole move. I got up and went to the bathroom to gather myself and put a bit of water in my hair so I did look like I just woke up. The manager was outside the bathroom and I waited patiently for him and he would just look up and then look down, so I finally just walked and said ""you are the manager right?"" and of course he said yes, I told him what happen and said that I know you are busy but that was unacceptable, I wasn't even asking for anything free just an ""I'm sorry or I'll talk to him or who was it please point them out"".  But he was just like ""ok,ok,ok"", like I was bugging him. Just another middle aged, balding, over weight restaurant chain manager. It is sad, because again I wasn't causing a scene or asking for anything free, and he was a total prick. I will discontinue visiting the restaurant, which is also sad due to them building a new on in my home town (only about 30 miles away) as we speak and I routinely take my 25 employees out to lunch, at least twice a week if not more, and BJ's will not be on that list once it opens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=580,3.16,3.34,3.34,2.572,3.2680000000000007

341,Lena K.,"Petaluma, CA",27,7,,2.0,2012-03-18,"I have been to this restaurant twice since moving to Davis, CA.  My first visit was satisfactory, but not great.  The restaurant was really cold throughout the meal, even though we weren't seated by the door.  The server was friendly and I liked that they give you free tastes of beer before you decide to buy one.  Their Oktoberfest beer was nice, not much to it though.  I ordered a personal deep dish pizza and it was fine, typical sports bar/brewery fare. The send time I visited the restaurant was for my friends birthday.  We were waiting for a few people when we first sat down so I think the wait staff was not expecting to serve us right away.  However, when we were ready to order drinks it was difficult to find our server.  After ordering drinks we waited even longer for the server to come to our table so we could order our food.  This was a different server but friendly enough.  The food came fairly quickly and everything was correct. I ordered a deep dish pizza again, the meat one, on whole wheat.  It was pretty good, but again, typical sports bar fare.  I tried the seasonal Abbey brew and it was very watery, so I shared the Jeremiah Red with my friend, which was better.  My friend received the complimentary birthday Pizookie, which was tasty and a nice touch, and some other people in our party ordered dessert.  One dessert was brought out quickly but another one was forgotten.  We sat at the table for probably 10 minutes before we were able to flag down someone and have the dessert brought out.  Finally our server came by to give the check and offered to split the checks, a nice touch also. Lastly, I brought home some of the deep dish pizza and noticed that the box says ""still the best pizza"" on the side.  Sorry BJ's, but have you heard of Old Chicago Pizza in Petaluma (sonoma county)?  That is by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever had and I think you can learn something from them as far as pizza goes. Bottom line: friendly wait staff, average american pizza, watery to ""alright"" beer, cold temperature, often slow service, wouldn't chose this restaurant for my birthday celebration even if the pizookie is tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=380,3.0,3.31,3.31,2.248,3.186

My GF and I only came to have a pizookie as dessert.  First impression was that our hostess was really weird and awkward. Our server was slow. She seemed overwelmed which is why it took us almost 45 minutes to get our pizookie and pay. As you might see, it wasn't very impressive. I don't know if I'd come here for a meal but it's rare for me to be in Vacaville. In general, BJ's has decent food and it's really just hit or miss when it comes to the service.

511,Patricia C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,2012-04-24,"By far this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. My friends and I frequent BJ's often and after the experience from yesterday I can honestly say I have my doubts of this place.  At approximately 1pm on 4/12 we arrive to BJ's (group of 4) we asked to be seated at a booth, the lady that was seating us rolled her eyes to the other hostess. Okay, we didn't say anything, I'm sure our request was an inconvenience. We get seated and order our drinks and appetizers. We wait and finally get our ice teas and they are brought without lemon or sugar. We ask and wait again. Our appetizer platter is brought to our table and the person who brought it asks if we need plates (irrelevant question to ask when a group of 4 people are sharing a large appetizer platter.) Our lunch plates our served to us and the person just walked away...we didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup or anything else. We try to get our servers attention but she ignored us (I understand that you can get busy but we were pretty much neglected) finally we flag another person down and ask for ketchup and mustard...by that time some of our food had got cold, our drinks were not refilled and our server had not bothered to check on us.  The bill is brought and we paid and still left a reasonable tip of 25% (we understand people have bad days). As we were getting up to leave and walking towards the door the waitress shouts ""Ladies you didn't pay your bill"" I have never had anything like that happen to me ever!! We kindly go back to the table where she is (she was at our table) and show her we did pay the bill. She did not even apologize, just turned and walked away. I have never been so humiliated in public like I was yesterday at BJ's in Vacaville. We ask to speak to a manager (because at this point...your establishment should know how bad we as paying customers were treated.) The manager pretty much just replied ""OK"" and said it was probably all a misunderstanding but didn't even seem sincere. I really am not one to complain but I feel the need to let you know how we were treated. I am hoping you take this feedback seriously and bring it to your staff's attention as I would not want this to happen to another customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=580,2.72,3.27,3.27,2.2760000000000002,3.05

We started off with avocado egg rolls - amazing!!  I'm not usually a fan of warm avocado, but these rolls were to die for.  The sweet-sour dipping sauce was perfect.   Then hubby and I shared the Santa Fe salad, his portion with grilled chicken, mine with blackened salmon.  More avocado, tangy dressing, yummy chicken and fish.  The  salmon portion was huge;  I took it to work for breakfast. He had the house-made black cherry soda (yummy, but sweet) and I had the Jeremiah Red beer.  Excellent beer, not bitter. All in all a pretty good restaurant experience.  Service was a bit slow, which was acknowledged; I knocked a star off my review. We'll definitely stop in again and I'll probably just have the ribs.  The watermelon/feta salad looked so good, but there was just no room. Parking can be problematic and I bet the weekends can be a zoo.  They have house-brewed root beer and cream soda, along with lots of other non-alcoholic drinks for the teetotalers out there.

Finally the waiter came back to the table to see if we needed anything, and I explained that we never got our soup and that been waiting for a refill as well. He said he would go get a refill and said nothing about the soup. This is when it got even more worse. after another 15 minute wait, the waiter shows up to the table with one refill, not two, but one refill. and then sets down our soup.

It lacked a lot of watermelon. And the feta cheese was VERY salty. I took a bunch of the salty cheese off my salad. Gross! At least the vinaigrette was tasty. The Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread also did not look that great like in the picture on the menu. I mean, I know food often does not look like the picture, but come on! There was barely any goat cheese on my pizza. :( It didn't have much in the way of roasted veggies either... But it did have a lot of basil pesto sauce on top. But holy moly! The Pizookie was so GOOD! Warm chocolate chunk cookie with cool ice cream? That was the best part of dinner! I'll only come back for a Pizookie. It was so amazingly delicious!

Overall the food was good so definitely 3 stars there.  It's nothing special, typical chain restaurant.  Good for lunch specials and happy hours but skip for dinner and cross your fingers you're there on a night when servers are on their A-game.  Plenty of better chain options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=360,2.68,3.16,3.16,3.0520000000000005,2.9680000000000004

The bar tenders were fast even on this really busy evening. My only complaint is they were out of buzzers the night we went, so we put our name on the list went to the bar to have a drink, and then they 'said' they called our name over the loud speaker but when we didn't hear they gave our table away. We finally went to check on what was taking so long to be sat and found out they gave the table to someone else. They quickly found us new seating, so all was fine, but there has to be a better way to let people in the bar know they're table is ready. We started with the chips and salsa, which were meh... I'm a fan of fresh pico de gallo style salsa and this was a more smokey cooked kind of salsa. I probably wouldn't order it again. I had the BBQ chicken salad on the servers recommendation and loved it! I don't know how they season the chicken but it was delicious, and the salad had the perfect ratio of chicken, to lettuce, to extras, to dressing. It was delicious to the last bite!

First, they forgot one of our order of fries. Then I realized they'd forgotten my coleslaw and returned again.  For my trouble, they offered me a drink. But I had already ordered two ginormous (really, do we all need that much soda??) drinks, so that was useless. And it costs them, what, 5 cents? I was, well, insulted by this paltry attempt to give me a ""good customer experience.""  The pork sandwich was simply pulled pork on a soggy bun. I think it was supposed to have other stuff on it.

255,Kim T.,"Sacramento, CA",32,270,,1.0,2013-05-30,"I usually don't mind coming to BJ's with a larger group of people or for an appetizer--there's tons to choose from, something for each kind of diet or drink preference. The food is pretty good and consistent at all the locations usually. They have a nice selection of small plates so you can try a few things. Their beers have improved quite a bit from maybe 5 years back but it's sad that the staff isn't more in the know about the basics of their beers. We made reservations for our large group and showed up 5 minutes early, that's when they informed us there was no reservation. We had called the reservation in more than 24 hours in advance. They weren't apologetic about it at all and the funny thing was that this was the SECOND time this has happened at this location for our large group reservation. Not a huge deal as far as getting a table, only about a ten minute wait. We waited on a few people in our group so we waited a few minutes to order. If we knew it would be another half an hour before anyone asked us about ordering again, we wouldn't have waited. Our server seemed to vanish into the back each time she left our table.  By the time our server took our order, the lunch rush was gone and our server was still never anywhere to be found. She was very friendly when she did show up and was on the ball to drop our tab off, but that's it. Our drinks took forever to receive, we waited almost an hour for food and were at BJ's for two hours because of how slow everything was. If there was some issue going on in the kitchen, communication would have been all we required. Instead, we were left for very long periods of time and even the guy who looked like he was probably the manager was walking around and never said anything to our table (or any others for that matter) or asked how things were going. We were all searching for our server so we had to have looked like maybe we required some attention. As this visit was frustrating for everyone, we will definitely find another spot for our work gathering next time. With so many options out there, it really is crucial to have servers who are on their game or at least honest enough to share that there might be a delay. There was no reason that today's lunch should have turned out to be one of the worst from the time we walked in the door.

My boyfriend got the Half Sandwich Half Soup lunch special: Clam Chowder soup and Grilled Chicken Club sandwich with Crispy Thin fries.  We were satisfied with everything. They bring out a bowl of tortilla chips and avocado for the soup first and then pour the rest of the Chicken Tortilla soup into the bowl. I really liked that because the tortilla chips were crunchy for as long as possible. Great touch! The Caesar salad was good. Big portions for both....I couldn't ask for refills even though they were unlimited :( I was so full! My boyfriend's sandwich and soup were good. The Clam Chowder is surprisingly delicious! It's a creamy but light soup and I actually prefer that over thick and heavy clam chowders. The sandwich was great.

Oh, and before they brought us our food they brought us someone else's food...geez, what was wrong with this place last night? Okay anyways, since I'm a much slower eater, I didn't finish my meal until after my friends did. We all ordered our dessert (I ordered like five minutes after they did) and it came after 20 minutes...except they didn't bring mine. My friends finished their dessert (because there was ice cream on it, they couldn't wait for me) and we were waiting another ten minutes before mine came.

It's 3 stars because although this time was an epic fail, usually things are pretty damn good on other visits.  My meal was late. I mean really late. Another's meal was even later, and wrong. Twice! Another's meal was supposed to be mild and came out spicy. Our server was doing her very best to wrangle the situation in between us and the kitchen. She was a gem. The kitchen, however, needs to be fired. Seriously. As an aside, we've never had a bad time there before, so I know this was just an anomaly. Well, more like a cataclysm. Oddly enough, I'm pretty amicable about dining out, having worked in fast food and other restaurants before. I know how much work goes into a service. But today... It kept getting later and later and later. Finally my food arrived, but the diner across from me was still waiting. And all she ordered was a stupid calzone. When it arrived, it was wrong. Sent it back. Waited another 25 minutes and it finally arrived after everyone else was finished. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN! She called the server over and said ""I'm done"" and handed it to her. Meanwhile, another's soup was too spicy after she asked for mild. The server was frustrated too, but she was very attentive and concerned. Also the manager came by and apologized. Here's where I shocked myself: I spoke up. I mean, REALLY spoke up. Like I said, I usually don't make waves, but today was ridiculous. My opinionated outburst even prompted a very pleased response from my significant other, since I never do that. Usually it's her job. I guess I was paying more attention than we both thought. That and the fact that I wanted to bring bit up to the staff before they forgot. Anyway, the manager came back and apologized profusely, admitted they failed today, comped our entire bill (except alcohol), and gave out about 10 gift cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=320,3.32,3.07,3.276,2.476,3.17

Yes, it's always packed, and the parking is horrible because it's in the same lot as a Chevy's and I think a Red Robin, but the food is great for the price.  We called ahead and asked if they had a corkage fee if we brought our own bottle of wine. They said it was $7 but when we arrived, we had to wait 20 or so minutes at the bar and the bartender corked it for us for free (maybe because we also ordered one mixed drink? not sure). Lovely! They are currently doing a special 2 for $20 deal in which you get a salad or soup each for two people, a medium pizza to share (ANY of their pizzas!), and any pizookie to share for dessert. I love this deal. Ive gone twice so far since they started promoting it and hope I can go again before it ends. You dont need a coupon, and I believe they stop it somewhere around Nov 13th or so.

My old friends and I always go here for get-togethers on the weekends or just to catch up with each other and eat pizookies!  Pizookies, pizza, and beer are definitely the must-haves at this restaurant. Before you even decide on what entree you want, make sure to save a menu and not eat too much to the point where you're too full for dessert.. cause believe me, you'll totally regret it when you see other tables around you indulging in all the different types of pizookies. From red velvet, to raspberry white chocolate almond, to Ghiradelli's triple chocolate, to even gluten-free chocolate chip! Okay, but forreal besides pizookies, BJ's offers a wide variety of options for appetizers and entrees. Almost so many that it's hard to decide.  Our favorite appetizers to order are the fried calamari and the avocado egg rolls. If you can't choose, try out their sampler appetizer (avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, and mozzarella sticks)! As for the main meal, if you're with a group, a good choice would be trying out one of their pizzas like the classic great white (chicken alfredo) or the bbq chicken. They also let you order half of one and half of another type if there's two toppings that you want, instead of having to order 2 pizzas which is great. There are also flatbread pizza appetizers, delicious burgers, and lots of low-calorie 'enlightened' options that are still quite flavorful such as the bbq bison burger and hawaiian mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice.

There is a dining room to the left and a bar area to the right of the entrance as at any other BJs I've been to.

We are at 3 stars now. Eventually I settled for Arrogant Bastard as any  of the other brews they had on tap were not appealing and I tried all BJs own beers in the past anyway.  The funny thing was the service staff is so misinformed about the ""BREWHOUSE"" menu that they don't even know what is on tap.

The fish and chips and french fries were definitely fried in old oil that imparted a bitter after-taste to an extremely greasy and bland tasting fish. The absence of flavor extended to the burgers and fettuccini alfredo. The alfredo was a boring and clumpy mess. This was a disaster and definitely a waste of our time and money.

590,Jennifer R.,"Vacaville, CA",1,11,,1.0,2014-03-22,"If I could give this a 0 star rating I would, unfortunately,   doesn't have that option.   DON'T GO TO THE BJ'S IN VACAVILLE, CA!!! The BJ's in Vacaville, Ca is way too overcrowded, and not enough staff on hand to serve customers.  I only went to the BJ's in Vacaville twice when I used to live there, and on both accounts, I had the worst experiences with customer service and fine dining.   The first time I went was back in 2008.  I ordered a giant baked potato meal and a side salad with blue cheese dressing.  When the salad arrived, I got a vinaigrette dressing instead of blue cheese.  I told the waiter that I asked for blue cheese dressing.  He took my salad back to the kitchen and returned 3 to 5 minutes later with my salad.  I took a bite, and could taste blue cheese dressing mixed with the vinaigrette that was on there from before.  Just awful!  Didn't even have the decency of giving me a whole new salad, but made matters worse by combining two completely different tasting salad dressings.  Just awful!  When my baked potato came, it wasn't even light and fluffy when I carved into it.  It was clumpy and chalky; like as if someone warmed it up in a microwave, and didn't put it in long enough. I waited a full year before I gathered up enough courage to go back to BJ's.  I thought, ""Well, it's been a year... Maybe the management and staff has changed during this time.""  I was wrong! In 2009 I went with my boyfriend at the time.  We opened the door to the front, and there was a female staff member on the phone with a customer.  She didn't acknowledge our presents by giving us a nod letting us know that she'll be right with us.  Nothing.  She was on the phone for nearly 10 minutes.  Then after her conversation, she hung her phone up and left the podium to talk to someone that was waiting in a chair by the door.  She seemed like she knew the person or was friends with that person, because she conversed with that individual for another 5 minutes.  So far, me and my boyfriend were waiting for almost 15 minutes at the front door with no acknowledgment that we wanted to eat at their restaurant! After the front desk lady was done conversing with the person in the chair by the door, she left in a hurry to the main dinning room.   At this point my boyfriend and I were like WTF?  Is this really happening?  She didn't acknowledge us, didn't take down a name, didn't ask us how many in our party, didn't tell us that it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, didn't even say sorry for the wait how may I help you?  Basic common courtesy 101.  She just zoomed down the hallway to the main dining part of the restaurant, and no one came back to fill in for her absence at the front podium.   My boyfriend and I waited an additional 5 minutes for someone to come back to the front podium to help us out, but nobody showed up! My boyfriend and I waited 20 minutes up at the front with NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT that we wanted a table to eat at.  NOTHING!  Usually, a person that waits that long at the front gets a buzzing coaster that would have gone off by that time!  We said screw this, and left! I talked to a guy from work that lives in the Vacaville area about a week ago (this is March 2014.  Present day time.) about my two experiences with the BJ's in Vacaville, and he said that it's pretty much the same as it was when you were there 5 years ago.  He told me that when he was there last, the waiters and waitresses never came by to refill their table's glasses. And you know what, it took me 3 MORE years from that crappy service that I had at the one in Vacaville to even want to go to another BJ's!  When the one in the Arden Fair Mall opened up in Sacramento, Ca. I got up the courage to go to that one and try it out.  And you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME!  So then I decided to try the one in Roseville, Ca. and you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME AS WELL!  So, it's not the chain that's the problem, it's the BJ's that's in Vacaville that's the problem!   My advice to the BJ's that run the corporate office:  Fire the manager and staff working at the one in Vacaville!  They don't know what customer service is if you threw it in their face!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=340,2.56,3.01,3.184,2.7880000000000003,2.8299999999999996

I like that they offer a healthy menu, but let's be honest here, you aren't here for the baked salmon....you are here for the avocado egg rolls, the deep dish pizza, and the beer. They brew their own beer, root beer and cream soda! One of my favorite drinks from the bar is the Irish Root Beer. It's life changing hahaha. Their menu is constantly changing and adding fun, seasonal offerings. It's really hard to get to the main menu because the appetizers are so good.  Today, we tried the watermelon mojito, the carne asada fries, and the fritos nachos from the seasonal menu. The mojito was too sweet, but had fresh watermelon in it, which was nice. The asada fries were our favorite and I hope they make it to the regular menu forever. The fritos nachos were good, but I thought it could have used a little bit more chips for all the toppings, as well as a lot less sour cream on top. We also had their Tatonka stout which is a little sweeter and toastier than a Guinness. Their Berry Burst Cider is excellent and refreshing. It's gluten free for those that need to watch out for that like me. BJs also offers gluten free pizza and an entire gluten free menu. The pizza is one of the better gluten free pizzas I've had, as long as the crust is crispy and not undercooked. The pizookie is the real reason everyone comes here. They are all amazing and they even have a gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. Save room for it!!!! Service is almost always great.

If you send it back, it's not going to get better, my advice is to order something basic like a burger.  Difference is okay as long as the basic flavors are still there. 2) When using the take out, the person on taking the order has a most difficult time.  This was not always the case, see one of my previous reviews.  In the past 6-8 months it takes 5-10 minutes to get it ordered. 3) The online ordering menu DOES NOT have all the dishes, so unless you know the menu, you wont get all items.   ADITIONALLY, the web design has changed and has become VERY difficult to navigate.   A AEARCH FUNCTION would be extremely helpful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=200,3.4,3.16,3.196,2.6960000000000006,3.2560000000000007

We were being taken out to dinner and the person wanted Outback Steakhouse but we assured them that BJs would be better.  Everyone was disappointed and we paid over $100 for the food. Our first waitress seemed highly distracted in which we later discovered that she was due to go home in about thirty minutes. Our second waitress was great. The food was bland and lacked flavor (i.e spinach and artichoke dip and peach and pecan cobbler), the loaded mashed potatoes were not loaded only had cheese and the waitress had to bring the other things to actually make it loaded from bacon and sour cream to chives, the ribs were dry and the roasted brussels sprouts were extremely hard.  Now why would the salads which should come with the meals come by itself and before the appetizers? Is that normal? Well it happened. The other dishes (i.e buffalo wings) and drinks were ok.  We ordered two desserts and was disappointed with them as well as stated above.  We profusely apologized for choosing BJs over Outback but still hope that this was merely a fluke.

When the waitress proceeded to take their order I flagged her down and asked her if she would take our order and get us some water. Her response to me was that it wasn't her section. When she came back with the other tables waters and spoke to her again and she begrudgingly took our order. We had been sitting for 20 MINUTES at this point.

When I originally arrived I was greeted warmly and directed to take a seat in the cocktail lounge since I was a single diner. After retrieving my own menu, I ordered a beer and began to page through the vast menu. I ordered a flatbread and corn fritter appetizer. The corn fritter was burned and had with very little aioli. The flatbread was as expected. The shame is truly the service. The place was adequately staffed for a Wed night but the servers can't get their act together. After two different servers asked me within a minute of each other if I was ready to order when I clearly just sat down you would think they would take my order when ready.

The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini.

A few in our party got there prior to 6PM and so our wait time was only about 25 minutes: not to bad.

Amanda was our main server ""excellent"" and all the employees that assisted along with her did a wonderful job in getting our drink orders & food to the table in a timely manner. Only one complaint that was had was a Porter beer that was forgotten & that same patron had a meal with room temp ( kinda cold) fries. That was quickly made up for by bringing her beer out promptly & a side order of fresh hot fries! BJ's Restaurants & Brew House's have so much of a variety of food to choose from on their menu & service at all the locations we've been to- has always been great. Seems they know how to train their service staff well too! BTW- would have given them 5 stars, but with the ""call ahead"" situation & the hospitality member ( male) we spoke with -not explaining to us their reservation policy/ requirements ( parties up to 6?) was super confusing!! Also, by ""he"" not handling or wanting to work with our request, that's why we rated it a 4.

We traveled 20 miles specifically for this restaurant. Before we left I uploaded and used their app to get ""priority seating"". By the apps approximation our table would be ready in 40 minutes (Friday evening, so that's fine). We left in time to arrive 5 minutes before that time. When we got there, I was told it would be another 25 minutes.  And we would be in line with everyone else (non-app users). It turned out to be an additional 40 minutes. So, the app was useless and I had to remind the hostess we were there at least two times. Which stressed me out.  So, we are finally seated and I tell a manager(?) what happened and he seemed sympathetic but said it's their computer program and WiFi. He did nothing to make the situation better. When our server came by she said she'd be right back. She was back 15 minutes later and asked us if we needed anything else - because she thought we were done eating!!!! Once she realized what happened she apologized and took our orders. I ordered a steak, with a Caesar salad. My husband ordered a burger. The food took another 15 minutes. The salad came out first. Then literally 2 minutes later our food came out. I let the server know our salad just arrived and she said sorry and left. What?! My rib-eye was undercooked on one side and medium well on the other. It was incredibly tough to cut. The roasted asparagus was impossible to eat because the ends were like wood. The whole experience was awful. And no one would help us make the situation better. I don't yell at staff, but maybe I should start. Because being calm but direct got me nowhere with this uncaring staff and their careless attitude. I will not be going back to this location.

87,Gary R.,"Sausalito, CA",42,8,2.0,2.0,2015-07-27,"We arrived at about 6 pm on a Monday evening . We had to work our way up to the host/hostess stand as the restaurant was about 50 percent full but the staff was unable to keep up with the crowd arriving after work and so there was about a two minute wait for a table even though there were many tables clearly empty and ready for everyone waiting.  We told the hostess we would just sit at the bar, since we didn't want to wait.  When we walked to the bar it was about 80 percent full, but there were no seats available. The seats that were not occupied by paying customers were occupied by purses and people's legs, like at a busy airport terminal. The staff seemed to make no effort to accommodate new guests, even after we complained to the hostess.  We were seated at a table on the wall opposite the bar, on the other side of the restaurant. Our table was about eight inches from the table next to us. It felt like we were at a Japanese steakhouse.  When our server arrived we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. We ordered two happy hour drinks but we were informed that happy hour was only in the bar area.  That is GARBAGE!  How can a restaurant charge more for the exact same drink just because you are sitting a couple feet too far from a half full unseatable bar area.  We expressed our frustration and we were told many customers say the same thing. Our appetizer was offered to the wrong table. Thankfully they said it wasn't theirs, so we eventually got it.  Our food arrived and after being auctioned off at the table it was very flavorful, albeit over cooked and dry.  We ordered wine and as it was delivered our server was apparently friends with people at the table next to us. So, after a minute of catching up, we got our server's proper attention. I really had wanted this to be a great experience. With the happy hour and the 'enlightened' menu, this could have been a regular restaurant for us. Unfortunately, this was a huge miss.  If we had seen a manager in our section, visiting tables and interacting with customers, instead of standing by the entrance to the kitchen or leaning against the hostess stand, maybe we could have addressed our concerns.

We were a party of 6 and were sat in a large booth. Seat immediately which was nice.  Our server took our drink order and offered us if we wanted any appetizers and we declined since the meals looked pretty big.  I chose to have two appetizers for my meal one was a fairly new item that they were promoting was Brussels sprouts sautéed in honey with Sriracha cream sauce and the Bacon Mac n Cheese. My hubby chose the shrimp scampi pasta. And our companions chose a Blue cheese burger, fried artichoke hearts, pulled BBQ pork sandwich and a cheeseburger.  First off my Brussel sprouts were amazing just the right amount of sauté and sauce on them not too spicy. The Mac n Cheese was the twisty noodles it was served in a small dish since it was an appetizer portion that came with two pieces of toast, which was too much carbs. The Mac n Cheese was flavorful with bacon but not creamy by any means. My husband said his shrimp dish was very good and it was a very large portion.

We ordered wings and then we ordered a Lagunitas IPA and a glass of water (my husband switched to water since he was annoyed at the beer).  This was the third ""flat"" beer they served us! So my husband asked to see the duty manager - he checked the beers and confirmed that the CO2 was off for the Red Ale and the Lagunitas - and he said the Temple of Stone keg was off and he was going to call the distributor in the morning.  He replaced the Lagunitas with one poured with the correctly adjusted CO2 - but this place is far from a ""brew house"" since we ended up being served three out of three beers with the wrong level of CO2 and in poorly washed glassware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=160,3.56,3.33,3.16,2.6000000000000005,3.422

Wait staff has always been very friendly, accommodating, and appropriately attentive. So far I've had the Asian Chicken Salad which was very good (from what I remember). It was large and very filling.  It had all the right proportions of greens, meats, extras - and the dressing was very nice. Yesterday I ordered the Fish 'n Chips. And I will say they are very good.  The dish came with probably 4 pieces of fish which was a nice plump white fish perfectly cooked. The batter was crispy and thin (the way I like it).  It was, however, salty and that could have been the tartar sauce - which I wasn't a big fan of since they tried to ""doctor"" it up.  Keep it simple folks!  I was impressed that it was served with Malt Vinegar - is there any other way to eat fish 'n chips?  Seriously??  The fries were wedge cut potatoes and very good! I would have like to have a small side of coleslaw - but the dish doesn't come with it - hmmm. Everyone at our table got something slightly different and it all looked good.  From the soup in the sourdough bread bowl, the artisan pizza, the fettuccine Alfredo, and burgers!  We also ordered a combination sample appetizer and it was very good.  There was some sort of avocado egg rolls (my favorite), hot artichoke dip, chips, breaded cheese sticks, and ? something else.  Everyone loved it!

So we got service and she took my drink order and said she'd come back for my food order. She brought my drinks fast and took our order, that was the last thing that went right.  I order coffee, no spoon to stir my coffee, common sense, right? So I asked for a spoon and we waited, 10 mins later no spoon, She comes back and it's been 10 mins more and no spoon and no silverware. WOW right? Nope, she comes back 10 mins later to say she will see where our order is, 10 mins later it finally comes. She puts it down and leaves. Guess what? No silverware. So I have eaten already and ordered dessert ( Not that good) and my friend ordered a stake med/well, well we got med/rare and we were not happy. Did I mention it took another 5 to bring silverware. By the time she brought the silverware she just asks me do I need a spoon for coffee.  Now, we are mad and ask for the manager and got a supervisor. And he was pleasant, but didn't offer ANY suggestions on how to rectify the issue. My friend was pissed and I was not having any of it. I said I'll pay for the drinks and my dessert and we left.

Also, I did find an onion on my slice I was eating. Overall, the quality was good and I feel the management did make a sincere effort to correct the problem. And they did ask me to check it before I left (I had curbside, it was dark outside and I did not have time to wait for a new one). Still not five stars because of the inaccuracies, but we'll call this one even.

I ordered the salmon with quinoa. I have had the dish 3-4 times since it was added to the menu. The fish was over cooked, the aparagus were chopped stems with two tips included in the bowl, yuck! The portion was comparable to the lunch size serving and quinoa was lacking flavor. The other dish we ordered was the ribeye steak. It should have been cooked medium , warm pink center!? But was basically rare. They offered to take the dishes back, fill it with another order, ect. The waitress told me they go through cooks all the time. Oh, so that's why there is so much inconsistency when it comes to the food!!!! This was not even a busy Friday night....or maybe the word is out that the Friday night cooks can't cook.

225,Richard B.,"Sacramento, CA",66,119,206.0,5.0,2016-01-18,"Came here on a Saturday evening, bjs was pretty packed. There was a wait for tables about 10-20 minutes and 10-15 people waiting in the take out order section. It was completely full. Me and my girlfriend luckily found a spot in the bar section and were able to get service in less than 3 minutes. BJs is an extremely versatile restaurant. It's great for watching sports, they have 5 large (60inch+) top quality  tvs in their bar area alone. Then there are more tvs dispersed throughout the restaurant to the point where you can view a TV from any point in the restaurant. BJs is also great for families, friends, groups, or just a bro lookin to grab a brew, very versatile, anybody and everybody comes here. The selection of food here is deep. They got steaks, burgers, salads, pasta, just to name a few. The menu is like 20 pages no lie... Eh maybe a tiny bit exaggerated. Let's talk about some of the go to items. Appetizers = fried calamari, fried to perfection and comes with ranch and marinara sauce that makes for a great starter.  The bbq brisket burger was extremely delicious, if you like bbq burgers, you'll love that. And for the rest of their extensive menu, i would say it's all above average, which is a compliment in my book. PIZOOOKIEEEEE!!!! If you have never heard of the bjs pizookie, somethin must be wrong you. This ice cream cookie combo will make your mouth melt. Top 3 pizookies according to my statistics are A) Original, chocolate chip cookie + vanilla ice cream, no you're boring. B) Salted Caramel, salted caramel is trending in life. C) Ghirardelli Triple chocolate. Moral of the story: pizookie is life. The service at this BJs was top notch. Taylor was our waiter and he's extremely friendly and attentive. There are two types of service, there's ""what do you want?"" and there's ""how can I help you?"" The service here was the latter, I'm impressed.

It has been a while since we last visited, figured it was time to catch up and ""talk story."" This is the first time I've been to this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse since moving from SoCal/South Orange County. I used to frequent their Lake Forest location @ the Laguna Hills Mall quite often, good times, and service was always great. Met NB just around 4:45pm, there were a few open spots in the bar area which is on a, ""First come, first serve,"" basis. Not to mention it's the Happy Hour ""Fun Zone!"" (i.e. - Only the bar area qualifies for the HH Specials) - ""Well, hell... 'Twist my arm, again."" Happy Hour Specials -  The bar had no open stools so NB and I grabbed a table directly across from it.  Photo -  We looked over the drink menu and I thumbed through it looking for something I saw the other week @ Buffalo Wild Wings, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer."" (5.9% alcohol)  Patrice our waitress, stellar. She was very friendly, good energy, upbeat, and trés helpful... 'Not to mention, patient. NB was split between the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls, two very tempting appetizers. Like me, NB is from Hawaii, I added, ""DO NOT expect it to be like da kine we get back on da aina, the poke here is haolified, dressed up with extra sh'tuff... Kinda like a hooker on Kuhio Avenue."" (Well, at least that's what I've heard... Oh, and Business avenue too.) So, the Avocado Egg Roll Appetizers it was! Me, pizza of course! 'Unless there's sushi, then it's sushi... 'AND pizza!! If they could find a way to make a pizza/sushi fusion dish, that would be awesome! They could call it ""P'ushi!"" I could eat p'ushi all night... 'And it's always good the next morning too! The mini deep dish pizzas are  1/2 off for Happy Hour, great deal. I decided on the Gourmet Five Meat Pizza w/added jalapeños & garlic, for good measure.  Patrice stopped by our table to take our drink orders as NB and I were deciding on what to eat. I asked her if BJ's carried, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer?"" Unfortunately, as I presumed, the answer was no... 'BUT they did have BJ's very own, ""Irish Root Beer."" Menu -  'With a description like that, I was sold! Shortly after placing our order, Patrice came by and apologized but she was being moved to cover another section of the bar and that Zahs was going to be covering our table. I have to admit, a part of me was bummed to see Patrice go, she rocked!  The order: Avocado Egg Rolls (HH Price: $8.95) - Okay; good portions Photo -  Mini Gourmet 5 Meat Deep Dish Pizza (HH Price: $6.63) - Tasty; generous toppings; good HH value Photo -  Irish Root Beers x2 (HH Price: $7.50 x2) - Hot damn!; great; good HH value Photo -  Grand total w/tip: $40 Overall, the food was good. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed in the Avocado Egg Roll appetizers. I was hoping for more than oversized, meatless taquitos. However, in this case the guacamole IS the filling. I know it's a crowd favorite but I just found it to be okay. NB, on the other hand, kinda dug it. (Shrugs) I expected nice size chunks of avocado, not this mushy, green purée.  Photo -  Now, for the $$, the HH Special on BJ's mini pizzas are pretty hard to beat. I prefer my food to have a bit of kick, added jalapeños and garlic, please... 'No linguicia on the menu, not too many places carry Portuguese Sausage. I requested extra sauce as well but do no think it found its way on the pizza, not a deal breaker. I enjoyed the pizza much more than the appetizer. Photo -  Now, the Irish Root Beer was pretty damn awesome!... It could've used a tad more Jameson, Baileys, and Butterscotch Schnapps but nonetheless it was DEEE'LICIOUS! After a couple of sips, I told NB to wait a moment before finishing the drink. I was able to flag down Zahs, ""May I have two shots of bar cream?"" Irish Root Beer + One shot of bar cream = One fine adult root beer float (For the kid in all of us!)

234,Evan A.,"Benicia, CA",531,77,424.0,4.0,2016-02-25,"I had been to BJ's before, but this was my first time eating at this location. From what I had remembered, BJ's has always only been mediocre. I was never going to BJ's for anything other than a pizookie. Maybe they changed their menu or I had just been ordering the wrong thing, cause everything I had this time was pretty exceptional. We were there as a party of 5 on a Tuesday evening around 6:30PM. It was surprisingly pretty busy, but we were seated within 5-10 mins. Just enough time for us to grab a quick drink at the bar! We ordered some avocado eggrolls and mozarella sticks to start with. Both were absolutely delicious! The avocado was super fresh and creamy, and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing! Some of us were even dipping our cheese sticks in it! The cheese sticks were also fryed to perfection. Very cheesy and just enough cruchy. Pretty much everything I could ask for when it comes to mozarella sticks. For my entree I decided to go with the deep dish baked ziti. They could have done a little better on this, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. I would have liked maybe a little bit more cheese, but they did really well with the penne noodles and the various meats (pepperoni, sausage, etc) they threw in with it. There were also some random spaghetti noodles in the dish which was kind of weird, but I don't feel like it altered the flavor of the dish in anyway. I also ordered the honey sriracha brussel sprouts. Fried brussel sprouts with a creamy honey sriracha sauce?! What more could you ask for?? The best part was the crunchyness of the brussel sprouts dipped in the sauce which was just the right amount of sweet and spicy! They could have used a little more sauce either in the dish or on the side, but I would still definitely order these again! For dessert we shared a pizookie sampler with a chocolate chunk, peanut butter, and salted caramel pizookie. They took a little while to bring these out after we ordered them due to the kitchen being slammed with lots of pizzas and pizookies according to our waitress. We were so excited when they finally came, we dug in right away. They were all good, but the salted caramel one was definitely my favorite! It would have been nice if they noted that there were chocolate chips with the salted caramel one, cause I might have just ordered my own! I wanted the salted caramel one but was also craving chocolate, so since I didn't know the salted caramel one came with chocolate, I agreed to share the sampler to guarantee me some chocolate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=60,3.36,3.32,3.244,3.12,3.3360000000000003

She did not communicate with us that the oven was down and that's why it took so long. We could have just passed on the pizookis!  Visit #2  We got seated right away in a hidden away table... the next 15 minutes we saw about 10 waiters and none of them even acknowledged us. Who knows where our waitress was??? Also this was on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. Finally we decided to just get up and leave... we got much better service at outback steak house!

I made the mistake of trying ""deep dish"" pizza here as Mondays?  Likely because ALL of them are 1/2 price!  Woo-Hoo!  Oh, no.  Wait.  I had to have that offer triple verified and approved by a manager before honored?!!  Better read this first. I called at 11:05AM and the order time on my receipt says 11:08AM.  I ordered the Bacon Chicken Ranch and a BJ's Favorite, both well done.  The host said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I gave them a little extra, due to ordering well done?  I got out of there, after waiting and paying a bit after 12 noon.   The chain is notorious for wait times.  Maybe they had to call Corporate to see if they were really 1/2 off/!! The cashier and few staff I met were chipper and friendly early into their work day on a slow Monday late morning.  Precious little parking which I guess was because all the staff took it. These pizzas are OBVIOUSLY PAN pizzas and nowhere NEAR  ""deep dish;"" FAIL!  One pizza was cooked well done, the other, absolutely NOT.  On both, the toppings started 2+"" in toward the center and the edges were rounded.  Deep dish, if anything folks.  You DO make food for a living, right?   The cheese on the underdone pizza, of course, was smarmy.  The dough on both were s.o.g.g.y., but much more, of course, on the under cooked one.   Toppings?  Folks, if you're going to LIST toppings, include them in a large enough amount to identify them.  It's like were afraid someone was going to be allergic to the non-meat toppings (onions, green peppers, tomatoes, etc), so they put only a 1/2 teaspoon of them on.  The pepperoni was wafer thin and NOT overwhelmingly tangy, so it is definitely a money saving measure.  The Italian sausage and seasoned chicken is frozen pizza grade [Ha!  You thought I was going to say ""quality?""!].  The small amount of seasoned tomatoes are simply strained from bruschetta , with the good oil/seasonings likely going into some other dish on the menu. The chicken was diced in hard bits...can we say left over makin's from the previous night?   The bacon was authentic, fried and diced up....not from a bag of Hormels/Costco Bacon bits and not dehydrated.  The few points earned are quickly lost by the complete absence of the touted hand-made house meatballs. I KNEW I'd done been had, when I braced me muscular arms for the heft of two, LARGE DEEP DISH pizzas and the boxes almost hit the ceiling, they were so... light...like, just lifting cardboard!

The calamari was pretty standard, no big deal, I always appreciate that they offer the marinara or the Ranch-ish dressing, nomm.  I recommend the sourdough bread bowl, because so far, every BJ's I have gone to has NOT let me down! Always a great flavor of some garlic and the right amount of savor. The clam chowder was yummy, not overly salty and just the right amount as well to fit into the bowl. It was filled with lots of seafood goodies, so at least they didn't skimp out! :)  The jambalaya was kind of a miss, overly spiced and needed a little more rice pilaf to balance out the KICK IN THE FACE flavor.

The waitress was trying her best to help but couldn't keep up with the various tables she was tending. If they were understaffed I'm sure they would understand if they were under payed by the customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=120,2.24,3.02,3.096,2.2800000000000002,2.708

We told her no and then it took awhile for her to bring our check AND did not clear our table.  We had 2 empty bowls and 2 plates the ENTIRE time.   What annoyed me the most was that she smiled and acted like she did a great job.  Not once did she apologized for taking too long, and not clarifying the unlimited soup/salads.

608,A G.,"Vacaville, CA",1,39,,1.0,2017-01-30,"My husband chose BJ's to celebrate his birthday with our family. We arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately which was great. We told the hostess at the front counter and the gentleman that seated us that it was my husband's birthday and we also told the waiter when we were placing the order.  The waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away and our meal orders five minutes later. He brought our drinks quickly and then that's pretty much the end of any kind of attentive service. Our drinks were dry most of the time and we had to keep flagging him down to get him to refill them. One of the times I asked for a refill and he came back 20 minutes later and asked us if we wanted any more drinks and I had to remind him of my original request. This was the least of the problem. It was 50 minutes later and they brought my husband's side salad but no appetizers had shown up so I asked him to look into it. Another 10 minutes passed and the appetizers showed up. The calamari was overcooked and the chicken potstickers were flat out cold. He apologized and said he would have them redo them. We were there for over an hour before our dinner showed up. I had ordered a Cobb salad and took one bite and the lettuce was so limp and soggy it was slimy. I sent that back and asked them to take it off the bill. An hour and a half after we were seated, two waiters showed up with all three of our appetizers again but looked at the table and asked if we had already had our appetizers. I explained that we had sent back the potstickers but at this late hour I would like them removed from the bill. At 645 we placed orders for Pizookies thinking we would get ahead of the game. At 7:15 another server showed up with another order of calamari. Are you kidding me? At 7:20 dessert showed up. The cookies are much thinner than I remember and it was like mining for cookies trying to get them out of the pan. Still delicious but much skimpier. The entire dinner took over two hours for four of us. As I watched my husband order dessert, I realized that there had been no acknowledgment of his birthday nor anything done about it. They told me at the door leaving that normally they do a small pizooki. It wouldn't have done any good to say anything at that point because our server was pretty much nonexistent throughout the meal unless we flagged him down. It wasn't until I was reviewing the bill that we realized the french fries my son ordered were never delivered either.  My kids love the dessert but my husband and I will be hard-pressed to return to this restaurant. It was a complete disappointment. I came home and had to look for something for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=160,2.12,2.95,3.084,2.404,2.6180000000000003
114,Michelle R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,14,,1.0,2017-02-02,"I am not one to complain or have high expectations at chain restaurants and I have resisted writing a review as I prefer to give places the benefit of the doubt, but the last time we went will BE the last time. We have been going here for years but finally reached our breaking point with the service. It has without fail, been terrible service with every waiter/waitress we have had over the last year or so. Things that happen every time:  -Dirty silverware -Food always comes either all at once (appetizers and entrees) or out of order (main dish then salad/appetizers) -Waiters/Waitresses always rush you to order and leave -They never take away any dirty dishes to help clear the table Now for some details on our last visit: As per usual, our waiter rushed us but we expected that. He had very long hair that was in his face the whole time and not pinned back like women have to have. We ordered an appetizer and each a main dish. The waiter came out and told us that the main dish will be coming out before the appetizer.  He then brings out our food. I had ordered no aioli (allergy reason only) and avocado on the side (to share with the person I was there with). I touched my sandwich and then realized there was no avocado on the side. I asked him for the avocado on the side, so he TAKES MY SANDWICH away from me and says he grabbed the wrong one AFTER I TOUCHED IT (so sorry for whoever he gave it to! yuck!). About 5-7 minutes later he tells me they made my new one with aioli - normally I wouldn't care but like I said, it's a severe allergy issue for me. So I waited another 10 minutes (about 15-20 minutes total) and my sandwich finally came.  Meanwhile, the person I was with had already finished his food. He had asked for ketchup in the midst of everything, but the water brought him a completely empty one (amazed he didn't notice how light the bottle was). Our appetizer dishes were never taken from the table and our water was never topped off.  The waiter DID offer us a complimentary pizookie - which was nice - but it took another 20 minutes to come out and was so incredibly burnt that we couldn't eat it. It was black on the bottom and completely rock hard on the top.  After receiving little to no attention from our waiter, I finally asked someone else for our check so we could leave - we were there (just the two of us) for 2 hours. It was unreal.  In addition, the fire alarm went off while we were there and that went on for quite some time. No explanation or anything was given to the people dining there...it was very strange.

We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. When the hostess took us to our table, she picked up a highchair on the way for our 1 year old that was covered in broccoli from the last child that used it...she walked away before I could ask her to wipe it down. I mean, shouldn't it be MANDATORY that the highchairs are scrubbed after each child uses it?? Those things get filthy after one use! Anyway, no one even acknowledged us for over 20 minutes as we sat there. I finally waved down a random person, who happened to be Mona, who's section was clear on the other side of the restaurant, but offered to wait on us anyway! She was on top of everything, very friendly, & even had her manager take off our appetizer for our inconvenience. Her service definitely deserves 5 stars, but I'm rating the entire restaurant as a whole. The food was mediocre (except for the potstickers, they are always delicious!) & expensive.

I called BJ's to check the call ahead seating wait - we were told 30 minutes and put our name on. When we got there (within the 30 min) we were told it would be another 30 minutes.... so what's the point of call ahead seating?? Luckily, a table opened up in the bar area and we took that (no waiting for bar).  My food was good (Parmesan crusted chicken), my husband ordered a steak and it was flavorless. Our waitress forgot to apply a coupon we had, but we brushed it off because we knew she was busy. We returned the next week with a friend and the whole experience was bad.  When our hostess sat us, I asked her what the happy hour hours were. She informed us we couldn't order happy hour in the main dining area, only in the bar area. I said that's fine, but I'd like to know the hours. She says, ""Well I'm under 21 so I don't know.""  .............. WHAT????? You work here, it's your job to know that. That's the dumbest answer I've ever heard. When our waitress came I asked her what the happy hours were, she said she didn't know. Again, I was stunned at people not knowing their job. I asked her to find out so she goes over to the bar area and comes back to let us know. Do the employees really not know what they're doing, or are they trained to say ""I don't know"" so people are discouraged from walking up to the bar and bringing it to the table for the happy hour price? (We also tried to sit in the bar area to get happy hour price but no tables were open.)  Throughout our time there, the waitress wasn't attentive, she kept disappearing, we had to always ask for our drinks to be refilled, and everything took a long time, we were there for quite a while. My food came out over cooked.  I asked the waitress if that was standard (I knew it wasn't). She responds with, well it really just depends on who the cook is each night.  I sent it back and when she brought it back, it wasn't right again. The manager came over to speak with me and I asked if there was a standard way to cook things. He told me the food gets prepped earlier in the day and maybe it's gotten messed up by now. I told him I won't order that item again (Parmesan crusted chicken) because I don't want to play the guessing game of how it's going to come out.

Salad was way over dressed and the ribs seemed to be spicier than last time. Once the kids were done it seemed he wanted to clear plates so I asked for a box. He brought a box and our check. Didn't ask about dessert, which we wanted. He just seemed too busy the whole service. I think it's a good chain but they complicate their own service with a huge menu and too many tables per server.

Overall the restaurant is always busy. The tables and restrooms are usually clean. Depending on how busy the place is, the wait can be between 5-30 minutes. Service for the most part is average, which is why I only gave 3 stars. The staff and servers are friendly, but the level of service can fluctuate everytime.  Now to the food. Usually go with their soup and salad combo. The chicken tortilla soup is probably my favorite thing here. I tried their seared ahi tuna salad. The ingredients are good, but their ginger soy vinaigrette is hit or miss. The last time I tried it, it was way too salty. Stuffed mushroom appetizer is good but not mind blowing, and I've also had their wedge salad which was good.  I'm sure I'll be back at BJ's again.

We had been previously and I tend to give BJs a solid three stars.  On this day, they were particularly busy, probably due to it being end of the school year/grad season. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait and we didn't wait nearly that long, which was great. Until we waited for what felt like forever after being seated.  We were there for at least 10 minutes before our server was able to get to us. In his defense, he seemed to be juggling a lot of tables, including at least one big 12+ group. We waited another 10 minutes or so for our iced tea and lemonade.  Then we waited some more...  And some more...  30+ minutes later our server, who we hadn't seen since we ordered, finally pops by to let us know that my grilled shrimp tacos were taken to the wrong table by mistake. He said that they were redoing my dish right then and it shouldn't be much longer. Another 15 minutes pass and our dishes finally arrived.  Right as we started to finally eat, a manager came by to check on us. She was super apologetic and offered a free pizookie to try to make it up to us. A nice gesture, although I didn't really want her to stick around and chat because we were quite hungry at that point. The food itself was alright. Unfortunately, it seemed that my mom's burger and fries spent some time under a heat lamp waiting on the take two of my food.  We did take them up on the free pizookie offer, and got a mini salted caramel. Unfortunately, it lacked the salted caramel flavor and half the cookie stuck to the little pan.

My Mediterranean pizza, which is one of my favorite items, was cold! My parents ordered the pancake combo. We've ordered that entree in the past and have enjoyed it every time. We're used to their fluffy, delicious pancakes! Today, however, the pancakes were so thin and my mom's bacon was overcooked. The manager even stopped by our table to give his apologizes, and they gave us a free churro dessert (which was the only redeeming food we had).

I ordered a unlimited soup and salad.  It arrived at 11:45am.  Every table was looking around and talking out loud questioning the service and wait time.  The tortilla soup was room temperature (which made me nervous).  It was covered in chips-- I asked for NO chips on top. I had to scoop them off to a napkin and after five or six spoonfuls the soup was gone.  I ordered a refill and that one arrived with no chips, and with avocado, cilantro, and cheese on top and was piping hot.  Who got the first one together? The server who realized we'd been waiting for ever?  The table beside had already given the server a hard time and I saw another getting ready.  We wanted to just pay, leave, and go home and eat something.  It's so obvious where BJ's goes wrong and lacks inefficiency.  Sometimes you get a good server and sometimes you don't.  A good management team would rectify that.

44,David R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,18,,2.0,2017-07-31,"Eating at BJ's in Vacaville can be summed up in Elisabeth Kübler-Ross's 5 Stages of Grief. Denial - ""BJ's will be better this time"" ""The service last time was a fluke, no way will be there for 3 hours again!"" ""The hour and half wait it took my server to bring my check last time wasn't so bad"", ""They have a $10 off coupon on their app!"". At this point you have convinced your friends/family to go to Bj's. Anger - It's happened again, you gave BJ's the benefit of the doubt, now you've been there for 3 hours. Your Friends and Family are angry at you because ""YOU WERE THE ONE WANTED TO GO TO BJ'S!"", and ""This is why we don't come here anymore"". Bargaining - The guilt of choosing BJ's for Dinner makes you lose your appetite at this point, your friends hate you, your wife wants to divorce you, your 7 year old Daughter wants to move out. You try and win them over by offering a Pizookie or telling them ""We won't come here anymore""(even though we both know it's a lie.), ""You can choose where we eat next time, just stop hating me!"". Depression - Everyone hates you because you brought them to a 21st century concentration camp known as BJ's. Your dinner party is ignoring you as they sit staring into their phones at the table. Now that your server has cashed you out, the shackles have been lifted you're free to leave. Tonight you will sleep cold, and lonely for you have chose poorly.

I'm not a fan of most cheeses, one of which is cheddar, I had never tried white cheddar so I asked her if there was any way of just making the mashed potatoes without the cheese. She went the extra mile when she told me they were really good and couldn't taste the cheese much and asked if I wanted a sample before I ordered. Personally I've never really been given a sample of food at a restaurant so I pictured a spoonful of it. To my surprise she brought it in a small bowl and I loved them! I thought it was so sweet of her to let me try it before I committed! She was super attentive!

I don't know what happened to this place but I am never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=40,2.36,2.57,2.908,,2.4859999999999998
17,Patricia C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,6,1.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"So what started to be the WORST DINNER ever turned out to be the best THANKS TO BREEANN !! GOOD SAVE GIRL!!! Because of your super positive vibe and quick response to us being unattended for almost 20 minutes !!! Yeah you read it right 20 minutes!! Without anyone saying hello , have you been helped etc. I did approach the general manager and was almost about to FLIP MY LID when Frank walked me back to my table in disbelief assuring me he would take care of us. BREEANN stepped In took our order and we were eating in 15 minutes !! Honestly if it wasn't for Frank and Breeanns professionalism we had oils have  left. We need more people like this",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville,2.4,2.58,2.92,,2.508
10,Juliette M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,26,5.0,1.0,2017-12-16,"(let me just say if you are going to eat here , your going to have to wait at least an hour for you food busy or not, it's ridiculous ) I've been coming here for a while and honestly it gets worse and worse each visit. Tonight was probably the worse because of our rude stuck up waitress. Her negative vibe just made the night awkward for me and my guests. Not only was our waitress bad but the food took MORE then an hour to arrive we were in that restaurant for 2 hours! When we were trying to get our check to leave the waitress was no where in sight. I think this is that last time I will be eating here. Food is ok",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville,2.4,2.57,2.92,,2.502
15,Matt T.,"Vacaville, CA",0,20,13.0,1.0,2017-12-23,Terrible service! Be prepared to wait at lest 45 minutes for an appetizer you probably won't get until your actual main dish comes out. Poorly supervised.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville,2.28,2.55,2.908,,2.442

3,Samantha L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,4,,4.0,2018-01-09,"My husband and I each ordered a dinner meal. Mine came out before his, and we waited 20+ minutes before asking where his food was, thinking maybe since it was busy that it was just taking a while. My drink also sat without a refill during this time.The waiter forgot to put my husband's order in the computer. 40 minutes after putting our initial order in, we still didn't have his meal. We decided to just pack my food up and take it as a loss, but the manager came over and offered to comp our meals. The wait was frustrating, but it was handled well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville,2.44,2.56,2.896,,2.512
