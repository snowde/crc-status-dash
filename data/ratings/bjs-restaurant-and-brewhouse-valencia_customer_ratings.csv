409,Justin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",564,31,8.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"BJ's is BJ's. The Pizookies are great, the pizzas and salads always deliver and everything else on the menue is hit or miss.  I got their limited ""Black & Bleu"" burger and it definitely fit the title. Heavily charred meat and what seemed like an ice cream scoop of bleu cheese on it. I ate half and took the other half home. The fries were cold upon receiving them at our table, too. It was a busy night (big crossover crowding from the mall) but that wasn't an excuse for our waiter to give us bare minimum service. He's human, I get it. But he was forgetful. I caught him looking over at our empty table about 20 minutes after we put in our order and watched him run back into the kitchen to immediately emerge with our dishes.  It was a good night, though! The pizooke, as always, wrapped things up perfectly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=400,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.284,2.64

Thank goodness we ordered some appetizers. We were doted upon with water and drink service, but I was STARVING by the time the food came out. Service wasn't particularly friendly either. The dark beer wasn't stout enough, and oddly sweet too boot. I liked the berry cider, but it's a total girl drink- like martinellis crossed with fruit punch. I like the buffalo wings, and the pizza never fails. The food is unexciting but reliable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=380,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.184,2.52
520,Scott W.,"Londonderry, NH",0,33,,1.0,2012-01-09,After 3 years we deceided to give them another chance. Sorry we did the food and service have not improved actually worse? Seated right away took are drink order and appetizer. Had the artichoke hearts were very good. Then placed our order and waited and  waited finally the soups came out but no spoons she then asked if we wanted more drinks and left to get our spoons and we waited and waitedshe finally came back but forgot the spoons by the time she came with spoons my soup was coll and my wifes was cold and the cheese ball was still sort of frozen. Then halfway through the soups our meals came the beans were cold and no one could be found our serverkept disappering. Then the busboy came to clear off a table next to ours and dropped a napkin on the floor and while looking straight at us he kicked the dirty napkin under the table. The food is hit and miss not terrible but not great and the service is still terrible.  The manager came over and took the soup and tacos off the bill we appreciated this but it was done so automticly that you know this is a routine thing and they just truly do not care. Terrible service and they just seemed to be resigned to the fact that service can never be improved we will never go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=520,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.084,2.52

372,Abby L.,"Carson, CA",348,8,81.0,2.0,2012-01-29,"No matter how many times I have gotten HORRIBLE service here, I keep coming back! I don't know if it's out of convenience or I'm addicted to pizookies, BUT after last night... NEVER again. 1 star for service... but I'll bump it up one more star because pizookies have never failed me. Here is a letter I wrote to their corporate office that sums up what happened: ------- To Whom It May Concern: I am writing, not to complain about our dining experience-- in fact, it was the best service we have had at the Valencia establishment in a while. Our server named Miko was attentive and helpful, and QUICK. Despite it being a Saturday night, and busy, and packed, we have no complaints about the food or service. However, I do have some concerns about the ""front"" of the house with the young gentleman and other employees who stand in the front, and who is in charge of passing out pagers and the waiting list. While I understand that it is a Saturday night, he should not say the average ""wait time"" is 20-30 minutes when clearly, almost every party waits close to an hour. Be up front and honest about ""wait times"" because it can really change a customer's night, especially when they have things planned. Furthermore, my biggest complaint is that we arrived before other larger parties (of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 people)-- and note: it was just my boyfriend and myself. These larger parties were given priority to get seated before us. When we asked the employees in charge of the wait list why these people who came AFTER us were being seated first, they told us they wanted to maximize table space, and were just waiting for a smaller table of ""2"" to open up. Frustrated, we continued to wait while others were seated before us. This is unacceptable, because I believed that the ""wait list"" was on a first come-first serve basis. This location's strategy to maximize ""table space"" was frustrating and humiliating to watch as we sat and waited... and waited... and waited, while others were given priority over us. Lastly, upon arriving at our small ""table for 2"" to eat, other patrons in the restaurant that were only a party of 2 were being seated at tables meant for 4 people, or booths-- a complete opposite of what the front of the house/management had told us about ""waiting for a table for 2"". I often come to Valencia to visit my boyfriend, and we choose BJ's to eat at because we like the food, and try to overlook the bad service or experiences, but after last night, we will no longer go to this specific establishment in Valencia, or even promote the ""positive"" qualities the Valencia location has to offer to our friends and families who often come to this restaurant. Please address how management ""manages"" things, because we feel it was very unprofessional, and a horrible experience for myself, and possibly other customers who dined last night. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=360,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.184,2.44

Last time there I had barbecue chicken deep dish pizza. Excellent! Very satisfying. We finished off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie for dessert.  I have always had decent service at this location. It does take time to get the food out to you at times. Order a salad or appetizer if you are starving.

I prefer the bar section for quick service while watching a game. I really like the small bites menu so you can feel like you're not over indulging too much.

276,Sarah S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",88,46,13.0,2.0,2012-03-10,"Let me start by saying that the food is great, which is the only reason I gave them any stars at all.  If I was scoring on service alone I would given the lowest score possible.  I've eaten at BJ's in Santa Clarita enough times to say that the service is consistently horrible.  I've finally come to the conclusion that even though the food is fantastic it's not worth eating there because of the service.  I've gone on a busy Saturday night and on a weekday during lunch.  It doesn't matter when you go, the bad service is consistent.  I feel that it is safe to say that BJ's in Santa Clarita has the worst service at any restaurant in Santa Clarita, or anywhere for that matter.  I want to note that this is specific to Santa Clarita because the one in Burbank has great service.   The waiters/waitresses and managers are typically unfriendly and on occasion rude.  I can't think of a time where they've brought my food out in a timely manner.  Every time I've gone there someone in my party's food is not delivered with everyone else's.  I've been served cold food numerous times or the wrong order.  Usually they don't refill your drinks.  The bartenders are usually friendly; however it's impossible to order anything even when you are sitting right in front of them.  I could go on and on.  I am surprised that corporate hasn't come in and regulated on management to fix their service problem. On the upside, the food is great.  Pizzoki's are probably the best dessert ever, their deep dish pizza has a really great flavor, their skinny french fries are yummy, and they have healthy options.  I think you're safe ordering anything off the menu and you won't be disappointed (with the food that is and as long as it is hot).   I suggest going to BJ's in Burbank if you want to try the food and going someplace else around the mall for location.  The Tilted Kilt is less than a block from BJ's and they have great service and food.  Lazy Dog (other side of the mall) has a similar atmosphere to BJ's with great food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=260,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.152,2.48

You'll still get the happy hour discount"" Well, they took forever to ask for our order and when it was time to pay, they wouldn't let us take the happy hour discount because we ordered past 7.

Normally, I've noticed waitresses rather flirt than take orders.  This one did both well ;).  Didn't think I'd find any good low-calorie food other than salad, and being Catholic, I wasn't supposed to eat meat on Friday.  Surprisingly, I found a vegetarian mini-pizza.  It satisfied both requirements and it tasted good.  We split a pitcher of Jeremiah Red.  It's my favorite beer, great flavor and strong too.  There are some pretty big HDTVs (60"") all over the restaurant so you can watch the game from anywhere you're seated.  Also noticed girls in heels and dresses like they were going out to a club or something.  I guess BJ's is all they got in Awesometown brah.  This is the only reason I am taking a star off.  It's the opposite direction from my nightlife scene.  A good experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=500,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.384,2.64

I ordered the 1/2 buffalo chicken 1/2 parm' nuggets and a side of wedge fries. The wedge fries were delicious, the chicken was cold. You could tell it sat in the window while she was running frantically back and fourth to tables. I served tables for 3 years, she wasn't efficient AT ALL.  Took me three attempts to get a refill on my beer. Then when she found out the food was cold she didn't even say anything but, ""Well, do you still want it?"" No? Wtf? Why would I want cold chicken. I mean, yes, I still want to eat chicken, but not that hypothermia chicken.  It was a mess, my friend and I opted out of dinner because she just made us both uncomfortable.

431,Cathy W.,"Riverside, CA",58,14,22.0,3.0,2013-03-03,"My daughter works inside the restaurant industry as a server. I get to hear and see the inside perspective of what my daughter, and servers experience everyday inside the restaurant, that many customers are not aware of.  One of the biggest issues servers face, is proper gratuity from their tables.  Servers get paid minimum wage, but after taxes are taken out each week on their pay check, servers receive roughly $2.13 an hour. The server loves a party of 10 or more, since this means one thing to them, gratuity.   Recently Corporate at the restaurant of BJ's, (a well known establishment) decided to take away the built in gratuity of 17% for parties of 10 or more. This happened because there had been complaints that the gratuity is taxed as part of the food bill by the State of California.  Understandable the customer would be upset over this right?  Why should they pay tax on their tip?  So say a table has a $600 check, which is common with a table of 10, with %17 built in they have a gratuity of $102. This is a $10 per person tip because they spent $60 each on their meal, (alcohol is usually involved). If they have to pay tax on this check, it would amount to $8 extra.   Here is the point:   My daughter who is a server, since the removal of this 17% built in gratuity, should have received $114 last night on a check, but only received $14.50.  She also would have received $145 on the party before that, instead she received a crinkled up $5 bill. Working from 4:00 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. at night, she made $19.50 gratuity on sales of $1,300... If you do the math, over her entire evening she received 0.015% tips. A server has to tip out their bar, food runners, and bus boys 2% of their sales, and since gratuity has been taken away, my daughter can't even properly tip out her colleges let alone make any money herself. To top it off, for taxes, servers are required to claim a minimum of 12% of their sales each night at clock out, in order to be taken out of their paycheck for taxes, 12% of her sales would have been $156, not the $19.50 she received in gratuity. So who does gratuity really protect? The server, without the added in gratuity for parties works at the rate of a sweatshop worker. Last night coming home, my daughter stated ""We are servers, not servants.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=420,2.64,2.54,2.54,2.0600000000000005,2.58

I generally pay cash, and this time I didn't have enough singles to leave my usual 20%, which would have been $4. Our server wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't so upset that I wouldn't leave 20%. I put $30 in the folder, and when it came back, there was two $5's inside,instead of the $9.66 there should have been. Rather than risk getting a lower tip, our server just ate the change, and tried to force me to leave a 25% tip. As I said, he wasn't good enough for that. Well, in this case, he got somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%, since between us, we had three singles. I won that one, but I should never have been forced to do it in the first place.

491,Lily T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,3,,2.0,2013-07-22,"Worst service in Valencia. As a server myself, I always try to give fellow waitstaff the benefit of the doubt. I understand there can be nights that are overwhelming and understaffed, kitchen problems, bar problems, etc. However, every time I come here, it always seems to take 10 minutes before I'm greeted... And if you're sitting in the bar, walk out and save yourself the irritation. Food is decent, but It isn't worth the poor service. We were looking to grab a quick bite before a movie last night, so we saw an open high top table at the bar. We sat down and were not acknowledged for nearly 15 minutes. The first employee at our table only dropped menus, and then we waited a few more minutes before they eventually bussed the dirty table. Finally, a server came by, lacking any personality or motivation to be there, took our drink and food order as we'd been ready for a while at this point. I had ordered a soup with my meal which never came out, and we finally received our entry within about 45 minutes since being approached. What's worse is seeing your server just leaning against the bar and mingling with other waitstaff. The server simply took our order and that was it. Didn't check on how we were doing and didn't ask about the food, which was also mediocre. With restaurants closing everyday, you'd think service of all things would be a priority to keep people coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=480,2.36,2.49,2.49,2.152,2.438
419,Lynda F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,35,4.0,2.0,2013-07-23,"Do they check their Yelp feedback? It doesn't look like it. The service ranges from ok to just plain bad.   I called in an order for lunch and went in for pickup.  I was tight on time so was, admittedly, a little anxious.  The 3 people at the host stand were chatting while the 2 people handling to-go orders were on the phone. So I wait since the host stand people don't do anything other than host, apparently. One of the to-go people gets off the phone and finally greets me. I ask for the order and tell him that I am tight on time. Apparently he can get my food but not ring it up so I wait again for his to-go partner to finish the phone call. She does and tells me that she'll be right back to help me. I am waiting again.  Food is finally paid for but not handed to me so I have to reach back almost behind the register for the drink. The 'ringer' seemed more like I was bothering her by having come in than anything. No greeting, no smile, no 'have a nice day' - nothing other than 'sign the top and keep the bottom.'  Wow - moving huh? Having 4-5 people around the area and feeling completely unwelcome is not ok. I like the food but the service just sucks. If it was the first time, I'd probably not have added my 2c here but it's not. Come on BJ's - get your act together. I may give it one more shot but it will be a while so today's lovely experience fades a bit. If its not better then,I'm done.

316,Greg H.,"Castaic, CA",0,11,2.0,3.0,2013-07-29,"Are you interested in waiting for a table for over an hour? Are you interested in waiting another hour to get your food after ordering? Are you interested in waiting 20 min per round of beer/drink from an understaffed bar? Well, then welcome to BJ's. Always packed, always slow.  If you have kids with you, prepare for banishment in their outdoor/indoor seating area that adds 15-20 min to the times above.  The food is very good and there in lies the problem.  People want a nice place to hang out with family and friends.  BJs offers a nice atmosphere, good food, good drinks, and very poor service.  They KNOW you will wait.  The waiters/waitresses are clearly overworked and have too many tables.  This does not matter to BJ's management  (which is a Where's Waldo of someone over 25). Nor does complaining to the manager about slow service and/or slow food delivery. I used to think it was because when the place was packed the food came out slower. No. We went at about 25% capacity and the food preparation was actually slower. (Side note: Even though there were plenty of seats inside on this particular visit, we were still banished to the indoor/outdoor seating area). This is a great place to watch a sporting event, the crowd really gets into the game.  The bar area could be larger for this reason, but they have space issues. Food is good and the prices are OK, but not fantastic.  Drinks are good when you can actually get them.  Plan ahead if you are there to have a couple of cocktails with your food and watch the game. Order ahead of time from your server when you actually see them, which is rare. I have gotten accustomed to just flagging down ANY server to fulfill my requests. I have gotten better service using this method, although I am aware that I might actually be contributing to the very issues that I have with the service. Maybe someone is doing that to MY server and that is why I never see them? We usually eat here as a family (date nights are reserved for more intimate locals).  So, if you have kids, you know that going out with your kids is like a ticking time bomb.  The older they get, the more time you have before that bomb goes off, but there is a time limit to their patience/attention span and your sanity.   Here are some tips: They offer call ahead service. It places you on the waiting list. Use this.  The number is (661) 288-1299.  It is not a reservation, so call before you leave to go. You still have to check in. This saves you about half the normal wait time. Do not assume you will see your server on a regular basis. Order drinks and appetizers as soon as they greet you.  This will make the inevitable wait for more drinks and your entrée much more bearable. Ask for your check as soon as you can and know you are done.  I have had 30 min go by before I saw my server back with my credit card before I could leave.  Apparently they take their break times pretty serious there. If you go with kids (5 and younger) order their food IMMEDIATELY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=300,2.24,2.49,2.49,2.348,2.3900000000000006

Been coming here for a few years now, and I really don't know why I keep going. This review is based on my most recent experience...my sister and I ordered a few appetizers to share instead of individual meals. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Margherita flatbread and the fried artichokes. The waitress, first off, was very unfriendly and was RUSHING the entire time. It was Sunday evening, I guess it was kind of busy, but it wasn't that busy. She was flying around the place and it was making me nervous. She wasn't attentive at all, either. She asked us if we wanted a certain appetizer first, and we said yes please...Then, a waiter brings everything out at once. I don't understand...why ask if we want something a specific way and then not do it? Also, this might just be my little pet peeve, but it bothers me that when they bring the food out, they just stand there staring at you waiting for you to move EVERYTHING out of the way on the table. They don't help at all, either. I mean, we didn't have a bunch of crap on the table to begin with. Maybe that's just me...but anyways, the meal was fine. Waitress asked us if we were doing ok and by the time we were able to respond she was already at the other side of the room. I probably won't come back, it's really not worth it.

I was hankering for a good pizza so we got a large BJ special and really it was no better than frozen. Maybe worse as it was obvious it had set for awhile before being brought to us as it was almost cold. Had I been paying for the pizza I would have sent it back as most of the toppings were also undercooked.  Lastly I had valeted my car.

He was not friendly, had no smile and made it seem like he was annoyed by the questions we were asking, regarding the menu items and how they were prepared. We ordered root beers, because we heard that they were great! We were so disappointed when we got them, they were flat,no fizz and warm. We told the server and he said ""well that's how it comes out"" We asked if this is how it always tastes and he said "" I don't know, what else do you want?"" We asked for Arnold Palmer's and he said that they had no more Lemonade. Really?? Okay, we finally said, ""Just bring us cokes"" We ordered chips and Salsa as an appetizer, it took another 15 minutes for him to bring stale chips and runny salsa. We again complained and he rolled his eyes and said, ""if you don't like it, what else do you want?"" We were starving, so we said ""Just leave them"" We all ordered or main dishes and after another 55 minutes, our food out. During those 40 minutes, we had to keep flagging him down, so he could refill our drinks. Each time he came over he gave this annoying sign and half cracked smile, as if we were bothering him! When our food  finally came out, it was okay, nothing to get excited about. We again had to flag our waiter down in the middle of eating, so he could refill our drinks. He never bothered to ask us if we wanted dessert and brought us the check. We told him that we wanted to get 7 of the pizza cookies with ice cream.

That said, the waiter (when he finally returned) took off the dessert at my request, but never offered an apology, acting more like this was standard operating procedure.

We have photos.. it's dough.  We played with it, we made a video and i think someone posted it.. ill post photos if people want to see them. and my triple chocolate pazookie was cookie dough still.. but it was ok.

Their avocado rolls, thin fries, and pizookies are also on my list of favorite BJ food items. Their drinks here are always pretty bomb and strong too. If you're not into their specialty brewed beers, try their Berry Cider!  I've never really had a problem with any of the servers here, but I'm friends with a lot of waitresses (not here but elsewhere) so I always try to be understanding and patient.  My dad loves coming to BJ's whenever we meet up in town for lunch or dinner, so I will most definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=200,2.48,2.41,2.41,2.32,2.438

242,Jeff S.,"Artesia, CA",587,18,76.0,1.0,2014-07-18,"The food was fine, similar quality to other BJs Restaurants, but the service here is unbelievably slow.  I have been here three times for lunch and every single time, the service has been absolutely terrible. The first time I went with a group of coworkers on our lunch break, which is about one hour, a fairly reasonable amount of time for us to order and get our food. It took a while for the waiter to come even get our drinks, then after we finished ordering, we waited about 25 minutes before asking where our food was. We got some of our food in another 10 to 15 minutes, then the waiter told us he didn't know where the rest of our food was and he would make sure they get started on cooking it right away. This was already past 45 minutes into our lunch break and we had to get back for a meeting. They ended up charging us for the food that did arrive, but we couldn't wait for them to get us our food. We had to leave someone there to pick up the rest of our food, which was on the house (as it should have been), and which they packaged to go. Turns out, it took them another 25 minutes to get all the food out and packed. Ridiculous, but we hoped it was just a freak day. The next time I went during lunch, we ordered our drinks right away, then waited 15 minutes for the drinks to come out and to order. We ordered our food finally, but the food did not come out for 30 minutes. All we ordered were a couple of salads, one small pizza, one burger, and one jambalaya. The pizza and burger weren't even that hot. Needless to say, since it was past 45 minutes, we were only able to eat a couple of bites before we had to leave. It took forever for our waiter to come give us our check, collect our check, and we got refills just once throughout the whole experience. The third and final time I came here for lunch, my coworkers and I decided to order ahead online to save time. We ordered one salad and one large pizza and one strawberry lemonade. We arrived when we said we would, were seated, and the waiter told us that if we ordered online, the food would start to cook as soon as we arrived and should be out soon, within 15 minutes. We thought that this would be a great experience that would redeem the previous two experiences.  We were so wrong. It took the waiter 15 minutes to get us waters and my one strawberry lemonade. Then it took another extra 15 minutes for the pizza to come out, not piping hot. In total, it took over 30 minutes from when we sat down for the food, which we had ordered online, to come to our table, not even hot.  We luckily had enough time to eat our fill of the food, and even managed to get one refill on the strawberry lemonade, which came out faster than the original strawberry lemonade did.  I asked for the check, but it was taking a long time (eventually took him 10 minutes to get the check to me), so I decided to pay online and tip low for the excruciatingly slow service. I asked also for a box for the left over food and that also took 10 minutes to come out.  All in all, I barely got back in time, and my coworkers and I vowed never to go back to that BJs ever again. Also, I must mention the cleanliness of the utensils. This was mentioned in another review here, but I wanted to reiterate that diners at this BJ's location should CHECK YOUR UTENSILS BEFORE EATING. Luckily, I checked my utensils, and found that the fork was filthy, with crusted food left behind from something. I went through three DIRTY sets of utensils before finally finding one set that was clean. I took pictures of one of them, which I will try to upload onto Yelp. It was disgusting, and really made me doubt the cleanliness of the set of utensils I was using, even though they looked clean. WATCH OUT! It breaks my heart that this BJs is so bad. I suspect it might be that they are understaffed or the waiters are undertrained. It's also possible that the layout of the restaurant is such that it takes a long time for them to get to customers, but I guarantee that we were not the only customers who were not happy. During my third visit, I saw the people at a table next to me send back two dishes they had just received.  I personally love pizza and BJs, but I will never come back to this BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=240,2.36,2.39,2.39,1.8600000000000003,2.378

I've been to the Burbank and Woodland hills locations and I find the bartending much better, so it's isolated to this location.  Also, the vastness of the space (with the addition of the enclosed patio now) makes service problematic.  I don't blame the servers for this.  What they need is an additional ""service bar"" for the servers in another area.  Right now they are walking 100 plus feet through a crowd and then standing in line at a jammed bar.  It just doesn't work.  Try getting a drink on the patio on a Sunday night--easily 20 minutes!

We ordered 10 boneless wings, artichoke dip, and a flatbread pizza. We waited for a very long time like almost a half hour for our appetizer, FOR APPETIZERS PEOPLE! So besides the poor customer service, you have to wait a long time for food.  One the food came, I was shocked to see that our wings were tiny in size, like one of the ""ten"" pieces was the size of a nickel, no joke. The artichoke dip was bland, nothing special, and the flatbread pizza was mediocre at best. We didn't get offered refills on our beer until we were done eating. At this point I was done with this place. Management needs to step it up and learn how to train their staff to be a bit more friendly and lively. I will not be returning at all.

All kidding aside, this BJ's in the Westfield Valencia Town Center has been a go-to spot for many Princess Cruises employees not only because of the 10% employee discount, but it was conveniently close to the offices, the food was generally good, and for those days when a game was on after work we'd hit up the happy hour. On this particular day, a good colleague and friend took me out for lunch on my penultimate day with the company. Having gone here numerous times during my tenure with the company, unfortunately, I chose a not-so-exemplary experience: Oktoberfest Seasonal Beer ($5.95) - Light, clean, crispy and a nice color. However, the marketer in me wished it was served in its promotional Oktoberfest glass for better branding of this limited brew. Not a hard concept, people; do you need me as a consultant!?    Lunch Special: BJ's Classic One Topping Pizza & Salad ($6.75) - Touted as their signature deep dish pizza (I ordered sausage), the presentation reminded me of the Pizza Hut high school lunches I had decades ago - FAIL! And, it seemed flattened and actually tasted like the frozen variety - DOUBLE FAIL!   The side salad was fine and had the right amount of Italian dressing; it served its purpose of the greenery I sorely needed in my diet.    Service - The place wasn't packed like it usually was so we were seated immediately inside with two views for the both of us. We were waited on by a nice gentleman who generally was diligent with us: we got our drinks quickly, water glasses which were regualrly filled, food arrived within 10 minutes, and he checked in on us. Only nit-picky knock was that we had to ask for the check (trust me, if we didn't have to go back to work we could've hung out for hours). Easy peasy. Parking (free) - You're in the mall so plenty of spaces. There were some out-front parking but those usually got snagged quickly. Our office was in walking distance so no issues for us. Just walk it, people! Atmosphere, décor, ambience - Your basic big-box quasi open-air werehouse-style building with high exposed industrial ceilings and plenty of windows and glass walls that allowed natual lighting in easily; in the evening the electic lights were turned on. There was a decent-sized full bar, the inside dining area was spacious and massive with both cushioned booths and standard tables while the front outside dining area was partially covered with outdoor furniture and heating lamps when appropriate. There were some promotional items that hung from the walls...stuff you'd expect in a sports bar. There were bucco TVs while background music also played. Attire - Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops if I weren't at work. Overall, BJ's in Valencia has been good to me over the years with their nicely-priced lunch specials, beer and cider selection, ample seating and the occasional attractive female worker. Historically, the service would be slower than I'd like if I ""needed"" to get back to the office. Ultimately, it was still all about the Pizookie and the Berry Burst cider - their hallmark menu items. I found fairly good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total paid experience for my share was around $14.00 before discount and tip). Although my colleague paid for me (thanks Martin!), they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX! 3.5 STARS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=100,2.52,2.4,2.4,2.668,2.448

It was easily the best guarantee for a fun time. There were cool patrons, cool staff and great food. Then it got corporate and I stopped coming. All the staff changed. Customer service plummeted. Managers were too suit and tie, not enough khakis & polos, if you know what I mean. Food, however, was always pretty good. We decided to give it another shot on Veteran's Day, simply because they were one of many local restaurants offering something free to veterans. I think that is totally awesome and well deserved, even if it is something very small like this. I am extremely pro-America and pro-troops, but I digress. Anyway, BJs offered a free plate up to a $9 value. I've always known the pizza here is amazing but I asked our server if it was worth trying a new, different entree (thyme chicken) or just order a new pizza (Bacon Chicken Ranch) I haven't had before. He recommended the pizza so I ordered a mini (individual pizza, 4 slices). It had tomatoes, Bacon, chicken, red onions and cheese with ranch dressing drizzled on top. We also had the Fritos nachos (complementary, but not so good) and chicken tortilla soup. Soup was very good and, as usual, the pizza was excellent. I'm glad our server made that call. He provided excellent, friendly service and was very patient and engaging with our daughter too. I can't remember his name but he was a young guy with the most unexpected, deep voice ever. That should narrow it down. Nice work dude. However, I can't say the same about the rest of the experience. The menus were sticky (gross) and there were dirty cloth napkins underneath our table.

The menus were also not clean and even the silverware was not clean.  Ugh. They didn't have kids menu's for some reason, but they did make horrible paper copies of it that were so dark that it was illegible. How anyone would have the gall to actually hand that out as a menu is beyond me.   The food came out (chicken tenders, corn dogs, fries and a mini pepperoni pizza) and looked like it had come from the frozen food from the section in the grocery store you never buy from.  It was bland and tasteless just like all the employees.  I noticed no one ever smiled.   The is my last time coming here.  Awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=220,2.24,2.37,2.37,2.5000000000000004,2.3180000000000005

It probably took 15-20 minutes for the waitress to come greet us and take our drink order in the bar. And another 5 minutes for the drinks to come out. I had the new lasagna dish which was pretty good, but I didn't care for the weird, crispy  garlic bread. It was just hard to enjoy because we felt pretty ignored, and the place was not packed. We had to ask again for some things that weren't brought out the first time. The thing that upset me the most was that the waitress kept calling me ""hon"" and ""honey"" which I find very patronizing. It was especially embarrassing because I was with my boss and co-workers and she only said this to me. I am younger than my co-workers, but not that much younger (I'm 32).

From what I've seen the wait seems to be shorter for couples since there are more of those tables. My husband orders the salmon fish dish which he loves. If you have any issues with the service just let a hostess or waiter known and from my experience they react right away. I highly recommend this place. I also really LOVE their mozzarella appetizer.

The last few times I've been to this particular location service and food have been lacking. Went on Sunday (2/8) for a family dinner. Here is a list of things that went wrong: *Did not receive any utensils or napkins - even after our appetizer arrived. *A pitcher of beer took about 10min. *Had to finally ask for napkins and utensils after our main course arrived. *Husbands steak was very chewy. He didn't even finish it. Told the waiter and he said they had been having a problem with it all day.... So maybe suggest we order something else??? Says he's going to speak to his manager and took forever. Finally after about 15 min he comes back and says they will offer free dessert. The kid wants dessert so we get the dessert. And that takes about another 15min to arrive. Its a ice cream and a cookie, I know it doesn't take that long, we've had them before. Its not that busy on a Sunday night. *Service was slow and it wasn't that busy. *Our server was a male. A female server came by and picked up our check and disappeared with my card for about 20 minutes! I finally went up to the host and asked if they could help. But of course they couldn't because I had no idea who took the check! When she finally returned and I questioned her she said she had already given it to our server.... Ok, so where is he so that I can sign and get out of here!? She says he working with a large party... ok, fine... since I don't really have a choice in the matter. We spent more than 2 hours here and we shouldn't have spent more than an hour. We didn't order complicated meals, We didn't take forever ordering. We didn't sit and talk endlessly once our food was done... Well we did but only because we were waiting for our dessert and then the check and then for them to come back with the final bill...

The moment we walked in the service was terrible. My boyfriend and I came in at 9pm, after rush with not a lot of tables filled. We were told it would be a 5 minute wait. As we were waiting, another group of 2 came and were given buzzers and were sat before us. I went back to the counter to make sure that they knew we were there and after 5 more minutes we were finally sat. Sheena was our first server and she was awful. She came and introduced herself and took our drink and appetizer orders. After 10 minutes, another server brought us our drinks and took our food order. Did not catch this one's name, but she was a little better than Sheena, or so we thought. After 30 minutes, we finally got our appetizers with no follow up from our servers. While eating our appetizers, Sheena brought us our food and dropped it off and walked away without even saying anything - and I mean dropped, not set it down. As we finished our appetizers, I realized that my salad did not have a fork, and we had no silverware or napkins. It took 10 minutes of us just sitting and looking around for the second server to come and ask us what was wrong, and then she took 5 more minutes to give it to us. Also at this time, my drink needed a refill. She said she would get it. After 5 minutes, she came and said she was working on it. After 15 minutes, I finally got it. We were almost done eating when our second server came and asked us if we wanted dessert, and I responded that we didn't know yet.. That was the last time we saw our server. We finished eating, and waited 20 minutes for a check that never came. I finally went up to the take out place and asked if we could pay there.

I would recommend management does some serious evaluations on their staff. Out of the 20 years I have lived in Santa Clarita I have only met ONE server at BJ's that gave me good service. Why do I keep coming here you ask? The bar is nice, the food is good, and they are one of the few places out here open late. Let me tell you about my experiences.. The last time I visited BJ's my waitress came up to the table, did not even introduce herself, and with a sassy attitude said ""What do you want to drink?"" I wanted to be like ""Hi nice to meet you too..."" incredibly rude. When we ordered (40 minutes later I might add) My significant other asked the waitress what kind of salad dressings they had. She chuckled and responded with ""A lot."" that is it. She never went on to list dressings for him! After this experience one of my good friend's told me that she had a similar occurrence and came on yelp to write a review. Well, one of the server's I'm assuming, messaged her off yelp telling her how horrible of a person she was for writing a bad review and how she did not have a life. This is where people come to express their opinions on places and guess what BJ's...you guys have been horrible. If you read the other reviews on here you will see that there are very few ones that would make anyone confident in dining at this place.

He had such a bad attitude right from the start. Anyways, I had received an email saying that I had enough points on my rewards card to get a free pizookie. I asked him if he was able to confirm if that was correct. He looked annoyed at me and said ""I'm pretty sure you have to buy something in order to get the pizookie but I'll check"" (we had ordered waters to drink).  I then see him telling a different waiter to check the points and Victor/Hector never bothered to come back. About five minutes later, a waiter by the name of William O. came to our table and confirmed that I had enough points to get the pizookie. He asked us what kind we wanted and placed our order. Although he didn't really check up on us much, he was way better than the other guy because he was nice and very polite and actually had a good attitude.

It was a busy night so we understood not a big deal.. The only thing meh about my experience was they ran out of vanilla ice cream for the pizzokie so they offered us chocolate ice cream instead. we thought that wouldnt be bad but NOPE! if BJ's runs out of vanilla ice cream and they said they'll give you chocolate ice cream instead, do NOT order it (unless you loveeeeee sweet stuff!)

Matter fact she didn't even say her name she said fallow me please. She takes us to this small table which is for 4 people, we look at her all of us and said are you serious? Or your making a mistake their is no way on earth we could fit 6 people on this small circle table with all the foods and drinks we are going to be ordering.

He instructed the host to seat them first. We were eventually seated by another host but learned that there would be one additional member of our party and needed a larger table. Fernando came over and rudely replied ""Well how many are there?"" which ended up being a party of 6. I guess my plans can never change and bring additional guests to BJ's so not to inconvenience the management. After finishing lunch, 2 of my party went into the bar while the rest went shopping. I'm surprised that I visited a place twice in one day when initially treated so rudely.

339,Marianne A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,58,,2.0,2015-10-27,"From the business - written on Yelp page - BJ's specialties ""... A team that lives to make sure you walk away happy.  To us, going out is sacred. We're on a mission to deliver a great time in a place that's as welcoming as the people who work here. With our roots in the fast-paced, quality-conscious world of Southern California, we believe that your experience at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse should always exceed your expectations -and always be worth going out for."" Saturday afternoon 10/24/15 about 3:15pm and we were trying to get in and out before a movie across the street. The restaurant was not even remotely busy. There was almost nobody eating in the bar seating area either so we grabbed a booth and then watched and waited while a group of waitstaff hung around and talked to each other at the far end of the bar. There was a waiter circulating around between a couple of high tops but neither he nor anybody else ever looked in our direction. Thought about leaving but as uncrowded as it was, we thought chances were good of getting in and out in time so we stayed. Finally, after at least fifteen minutes, waiter Kyle 830 wandered over. No ""thanks for waiting"" or ""sorry for the wait"" - he dropped two menus off and asked if we wanted a sample of pumpkin ale. We said no thanks, ordered drinks. Kyle came back with my diet pepsi and dropped two sets of silverware/napkins on the table - said nothing, and walked away again. Nothing like ""I'll be right back to take your order""- just disappeared. He finally returned with Tim's drink from the bar after carrying it around for a few minutes while he was taking a check to a different table and checking on another- set it down and walked away from us again, STILL not having taken our food order or saying he would be back in a minute or whatever. We watched him take dirty plates away from another table, take a check to a different table . . . easily ten or more minutes before I finally caught his eye from a distance and sort of raised an eyebrow and smiled at him. He still didn't come over- and when he finally did, it was just totally weird to have someone walk up with a pad and pen and just look at us and smirk at us, write down our order, say ok and walk away. He brought out our food and dropped it off, still aloof- never approached us after that and wouldn't even look in our direction -not for refills, not to ask if everything was ok, nothing- even though he was at the booth right next to ours and the high top right near us several times. Glasses were empty, we had finished eating and had stacked our plates and he was nowhere in sight. He finally came back to ask if we wanted dessert but still didn't offer refills. We didn't want dessert because not really enough time before movie plus which by then we just wanted to get out of there. We asked for the check and he brought it and set it down without a word- took awhile to return to pick it up without a word- took longer than it should've to run the card and bring the check back- then he just set it down and walked away again. No thanks for coming in or have a good afternoon- just totally frosty, going through the motions. Kyle, you would've gotten double the tip if you had been remotely friendly to us. We tip 20% on the total including tax for just routine (even slow) service with nothing extra or special- and then throw an extra $1 or sometimes $2 on top of that when the waitstaff adds to the experience and makes it fun. This was the first time we've ever even considered leaving nothing at all. We left you $4 on $34 only because our orders came out correctly- that was the one single thing you did well. The low tip wasn't because of all of the waiting to order drinks and then food, it wasn't even that we didn't get refills because you weren't around- it's that you were so unfriendly and almost pretentious during our every single interaction with you, right from the start and all the way through.  Although it wasn't jamming and crowded, we still knew we weren't your only table and didn't give you any attitude at all, even for the wait when you first came over to us. We always try to think if someone might be having a rough day and were trying to be chilled and nice. It didn't seem like you were shy because you were talking and laughing with customers at other tables, also checking in on them without being flagged down. It was like you wanted us to go away- you showed almost open hostility towards us and neither of us can figure out why. Yeah, I absolutely sniffed out loud at the end when you just set the card and check down, turned around and walked away- I don't think we've ever had anyone just set a check down, turn their back and walk away without a thanks or have a good night or whatever. I see from other reviews that our experience with this certain waiter wasn't just a one-off occurrence. Far more choices for eating out besides BJ's.

223,C R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,13,1.0,1.0,2015-11-08,"BJs is a restaurant that traditionally caters to large and small groups alike. Tonight was a gathering of three families after a cheerleading performance - we were a party of 10. Unfortunately, this outing became what I am calling the tale of the ""Table of Fail"". This was the trifecta of food, drink and service fail. It begins by being seated without menus, napkins and utensils. Iced tea served without sweeteners. Drinks ordered from the bar that were never delivered (cause was that our waitress was new and didn't know to enter bar orders into their system). When the drinks finally arrived, after 45 minutes, they tasted terrible. Lack of follow up left the table without soft drink refills for an eternity. Food orders arrived after an unusually long wait, but not all at once. Orders arrived in 4 waves and some orders were incomplete. Fries delivered on only one kids meal, while the other kids had to wait longer for theirs. No ketchup on the table and none brought with the fries. Three guests ordered deep dish pizzas, none of them had more than a mere suggestion of pizza sauce on them, rendering them dry and tasteless. Of the 10 meals ordered, only 2 of them were correct and edible. At one point, one of our party actively got up from the table to find a manager to clue him in on the activities at the ""Table of Fail"". Fernando the manager pledged to address the issues, but the service actually worsened after his intervention. Later, when we got him to the table, he proceeded to throw the waitress under the bus by saying she did not alert him to how bad things were going at our table. We reminded him that we told him personally how bad it was. It took a few minutes of vigorous debate for Fernando to just erase the bill entirely.  It's over 2 hours of our lives we'd like to get back. Going forward, BJs will be cast to the lowest level of regard for another visit. Advice to others is to severely lower their expectations of food, drink and service levels. Allow for an eternity.

After 40 minutes of waiting for food, we asked a server (not ours) what was going on with the kitchen because we heard him apologize to at least 3 tables around us for the long wait and brought them complimentary pizookies to eat while they continued to wait for their dinners. He said the restaurant is busy, understaffed and only had one Manager on duty. (We didn't quite understand how the number of Managers on Duty was relevant unless that meant with no Manager in the kitchen, the kitchen couldn't make a pizza within an hour.) He said he would check on our food and 20 minutes later never came back with an update. During this time, our server also said he would check on our food and never came back.  After 75 minutes with no food on the table (not even the kids' mac n cheese!) our party of 6 walked out of the restaurant.  I will never go back to the Valencia location regardless of how much my son begs me to.  We are looking forward to celebrating his birthday dinner properly, with excellent service and reasonable cook times, tomorrow night at our ""usual location"" in Laguna Hills.  The Manager and entire kitchen staff on duty last night should be fired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=320,2.2,2.67,2.528,2.052,2.482

150,Ryan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,192,17.0,2.0,2015-11-30,"The food was fine - it tasted like any other BJ's. The service was very poor though. We had a large group that came in for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Trying to book the group was a pain since we got multiple directions on what to do. We initially called and were told we needed to come in to speak with the manager. We live 45 minutes away so we planned an evening to come down for dinner, and get everything booked. Once we were seated we brought up the reservation and had to bounce around a few clueless people until a manager came over and told us we just had to call and could do everything over the phone. The night we came in the food and drinks were taken care of, but there were multiple other issues. The food was setup buffet style and our guests told they could go serve themselves, but several dishes on the buffet table were missing utensils. We had to ask several people until someone finally brought the tools needed. Since it was a rehearsal dinner there was one point where someone was attempting to make a speech. The only person standing and was holding a paper she was reading from. This was the moment one of the waitresses chose to ask the speaker (mid speech) where she should drop off two sodas. I don't know why she expected the person standing to know who ordered a couple of sodas, and why she felt she had to stop a person clearly in the middle of a speech as opposed to anyone else around. It was absolutely rude. At one point a full glass of ice water spilled all over the floor in between two tables. Our server was standing right there, watched it happen, asked if everyone was okay, and then disappeared. I ended up having to go to the server station and taking a handful of cloth napkins to lay on the floor because our server never same back with a towel, or any offer of assistance for us dry the floor. I know it was a big group, and accommodating for time or accuracy I am fully understanding of. The issues we had demonstrated a lack of coordination and consideration for our group which was extremely irritating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=140,2.2,2.74,2.54,2.248,2.524

It was about $48 for a pint of beer, a strawberry lemonade, 2 small pizzas and a ahi poke appetizer. Our server was extremely nice and quick.

We sat down and put our drink orders in and when she brought them over she managed to spill one of the drinks on the table. She didn't even bother to apologize, just smirked and walked away. We figured it happens so we left that alone.   Then we put our food orders in and waited for what felt like forever. After an hour of waiting for our meals I asked her nicely if she could check in the food to see when it would be coming and her repose ""duh well they have to cook it."" followed by a sarcastic giggle. Hm, ooookay. Another 20 minutes goes by and the people that came after us have all gotten their food and left. When we finally received the food not only was it cold all the wings were undercooked. An hour and twenty minute wait and the food wasn't fully prepared?    We were all annoyed at that point and decided that we would just order pazookies to go but of course our lovely waitress was no where to be found. So we called for another server and asked if he could send her over. Another 10 minutes goes by and she finally appears, we put the orders in hoping they would be prepared quicker than the food. While waiting we see her speaking with a few of the other waitresses and she was pointing at us and giggling.. I'm sorry but that is something you just don't do. After being there for 2 1/2 hours and having to deal with such horrible service, we got our pazookies, paid for the cold- uncooked food and left..

So with our permission he took the rest of our order out to us sans the burger. This was after he came several times more before to check up on us. After another 5-10 mins the burger came out and it was fresh and hot off the grill!

The waitress thought me calling from my cell was funny, and had the front desk operator Hector bring us the items we requested.  During our dinner one of the waitresses spilled an entire cocktail on one of our guests. Then came over with a napkin and tried to clean him with a smile on her face. Not apologetic what so ever.  Throughout the night our conversations were interrupted several times due to waiters asking us if we ordered certain food items that we never ordered. It seems that the waiters & waitresses don't know which table ordered what and they walk around with dishes asking every table whose food is who.  It took another 45 minutes to receive our check.

I love that the cookie bases are crunchy on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. The cold ice cream scoops pair nicely with the warm cookies, in the process melting the ice cream and creating a creamy ""sauce."" It sounds like a very simple dish but it tastes amazing. As for the savory food, I've tried some dishes like the burgers and the steak but they all seem rather average, though the portions are quite big. When I dine at a restaurant, I'd rather eat something that tastes like something I can't get at a fast food joint or something that I can't make for myself at home.

Aug. 13th, my husband and I decided to try BJ's AGAIN, for dinner.We thought after the last time about 8-9 months ago, maybe things would change. Wishful thinking, no changed, just worse than the last visit. Our waitress, I believe her name is Danielle, was quite busy, but she tried. We ordered a very simple meal, my husband asked for a Turkey Burger, with only tomato, raw onion only, and dry, I ordered a simple Wedge Salad, with Ranch Dressing, tomato, and bacon. Well, now after waiting, 25 minutes to get a table, we waited  almost 40 minutes for our food. She did tell us after awhile, that they were very busy. Well we finally got our order, and it was not good at all. My husband's Turkey Burger, was  very dried out, with an awful dry roll, no tomato, and my wedge salad, had a drop of dressing, could not find the bacon, and it was on a plate, that when I tried to cut it up, was falling off the plate. We asked the waitress to please bring some more dressing and bacon, and tomatoes for my husbands burger, what does she do, goes and take an order from a nearby table of 4. We were able to flag down the Manager on duty, did not get his name, kinda tall stocky man, told him our problem, he went got the plate, dressing and a ramekin with practically raw bacon. Told our server, manage did not return, and we told the waitress , she said do not worry about it, and we did not get a bill.

My children and I waited about 15 minutes- definitely more than the standard wait time during busy service (at the time of arrival it was semi-busy but not slammed)- not one staff member acknowledged our table. I counted at least a dozen different team members that passed by our table- including a man who may have been the manager on duty- and no one said hello or I'll be with you in a few minutes or anything (let alone drink orders)! I purposely waited what I believed was 15 minutes to see if we would be acknowledged and of course, we were not. At this point we walked out and dined elsewhere. BJ'a has the advantage as one of the limited franchised family restaurants in Santa Clarita so I can see why they continue to stand- it certainly isn't successful for its service and high quality of food (unless food has improved in the last year- had an unfortunate experience with their food too).

Okay, fine. But continuing to walk by our table without another word after our party had assembled completely, menus closed, ready to order? Come on man!  The server quickly rushed through the order taking process, and that's where it went downhill. One of our guests asked if happy hour also included the dining room, and the server said, ""no, it applies to the bar only"". Understood, just thought we would check. But then he added, ""you're more than welcome to all move to the bar if there's room but I don't know how long you'd have to wait for people to get up. And that's fine if you want to do that, because I'm not really feeling this today.""  You're ""not really feeling this today""?!? The comment left our table of hospitality professionals baffled.

People ought to be able to complete their meal in an hour and a half, instead we sat there hungry with nothing to show for. EXTREMELY UNHAPPY with my service here. I will not be returning to this location, will likely not return to any BJ's franchise ever, and I'll make sure to tell all my friends in the valley what a horrible restaurant this is.

It's something very close to our hearts since we used to frequent the Burbank location when we used to live in SFV.  But, there are differences at this particular location that we really like. The crowd is a much mature, less rowdy and more classy people than the one in Burbank. We also never had a problem finding a seat by the bar, and eventhough they can get really busy in the weekends, we've never had to wait long for a table. Parking is never a big hassle and the waitstaff are much more pleasant and classier.  At the many times I've been here, I've only had one not so pleasant experience with the service, so that is a good thing I suppose. They have daily specials, like $10 burgers on Wednesdays, $18.99 for a whole slab of ribs plus 2 sides and mini pizookie, etc. Most of the items in the menu are delicious, just the Sante Fe salad was disappointing. They have many options for eats and drinks that it's hard to decide at times but my usuals are the avocado rolls, any of the pizzas and the spritzers.

61,Bryan J.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-04,"Hello. Posting a horrible experience that my family had at BJ's (with one positive note). My wife, kids and mom (party of 5) arrived at BJ's at about 6:50PM last night. We needed to wait 30 minutes to get a table which wasn't a big deal considering it was a Saturday night. When we sat down the waitress was fairly prompt to come over to take our drink orders. We also order an appetizer (their app sampler).  The drinks finally arrived after 5 minutes. Still - no big deal at waiting on the drinks as we assumed they must be busy (although it seemed like there was a lot of empty tables). After about 20 minutes, we still had not received our appetizer. The waitress informed us that it should be out momentarily. A few minutes after that - they brought me my small bites Mac and cheese. I explained that I asked for it to come out with my main meal. They apologized and took it back. Still...no appetizers.  After 30 minutes, the appetizers came out. The waitress explained that they had a problem with the avocado roll which caused the delay. We started eating the appetizer - the avocado roll was nice and hot but everything else was Luke warm to cold.  After about 10 minutes of getting our appetizer our main food came out. Naturally we were only about 1/2 done eating our cold appetizer.  The main meal was ok and seemed to have been cooked as ordered. HOWEVER - remember the Mac and cheese? Well that didn't come out with the order. I asked the waitress about it and she said that she would check into it. She came back 10 minutes later and said that the Mac and cheese would be out in just 2 minutes longer. She noticed that my water was empty (duh - we'd been there for about an hour at this point) and said that she would get more water for me. They never came around to fill my water. However - someone did come to my son who had about 25% of his glass full of sprite and filled HIS glass with water. I informed the waitress that he was drinking sprite and she went to get him another glass of sprite. After about 10 more minutes my Mac and cheese came out. At this point I had already finished my meal so I was so i told the waitress that it was too late and to send the manager over to me. The manager arrived and I went through the list of issues and he agreed it was not very good service so he comped the meal. We got up and left. I was so upset by the experience that we did not leave any tip for the waitress. Something about me - even when service is bad I ALWAYS leave 10% tip but my standard tip is 20% - I say this to give you an idea of how bad the service and food was. This was my first visit to BJ's. while the manager tried to make it right - I don't know if I am willing to give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=60,2.12,2.3,2.552,2.052,2.2279999999999998

136,P D.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,33,,1.0,2017-06-07,"Normally I wait a couple days before writing a review to let my feelings settle, but not this time.   Tonight, we came to BJ's with family and friends to celebrate a graduation.  We were seated at approximately 6:40 PM and drink orders taken.  Ten minutes later server returns, with no drinks and takes our orders.  Twenty minutes later, still no drinks, so we ask, server say nothing and disappears for ten minutes, finally returning with our drinks.  Over an hour passes and still no food.  One member of our party asks our server when we will get our food and he replies, ""you'll get it when it comes out"".  Unbelievable.  Over ninety minutes pass when our food finally arrives, one person with our group ordered a small pizza, she never got it.  Every time we asked our server where her pizza is, he replied that it was still in the oven.  For 90 minutes?? The server said they ran out of small pizzas, so they gave her a large and charged her for a medium!  She ended up paying more for something she didn't want in the first place.   The son (he's 5) of another one our friends had macaroni and cheese, he was the last person to receive his dinner, one hour and forty five minutes later.  When we asked our server, he mumbled something about a mix up in the kitchen.  How can you mess up mac and cheese? In addition to the extremely long wait for our food, our server never bothered to refill any of our drinks.  I had ice tea, which was warm, plus he never bothered to bring sugar.  We asked for water twice, 15 minutes later it arrived.  Plus, we asked our server for silverware, he never brought it, we had to flag down another server to get it for us plus he left the menus on the table the entire time we were there.  Couple the atrocious service with the extremely long wait for our food and we had one of the worst dining experiences we've had in a long time.  I understand being a server is a difficult job, but this service was so bad, I didn't think twice about not leaving a tip.

The area was beautiful, right near the Westfield Mall and in a gorgeous neighborhood. We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated in 10 minutes when they told us it would 30. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and everything was going great. I ordered the sriracha boneless wings and we could have used a drink refill during this time, but we didn't get one. Then the entrees started to role out, they brought my wife's, both of my kids and then the waitress comes back 5 minutes later to check if everything was OK, and noticed she never brought me my Baked Zitti. About 5 minutes after that the manager tells me the ""chef"" said it was coming right out. Another 5 minutes pass and the waitress offers me a soup, and at this point my family is almost done eating the meal they practically let get cold while waiting to eat with me. Once my  penne pasta with some cheese and light sauce (virtually no flavor or meat) arrives, I was well passed caring about being at this restaurant. Once they screwed up my food, our waitress was M.I.A. on giving anyone at our table service. Whether it was embarrassment or not caring she never came around. I had to hunt her down for the check, the manager never tried to make up for bringing my food out after my whole family finished their food so I left her a smaller than average tip that she didn't deserve and then we headed somewhere else for dessert.

I can swear with the best of 'em. But since my kids were at the next table, I would have thought that they would have toned it down. Alas, alcohol does impair judgement.

Today was our first time visiting this location since we just happened to be at the mall and got hungry. The food we ordered was fantastic. However, I'm giving this location two stars because the service here was terrible. I've never experienced this before in any of the other BJ's I've visited. I don't want to put the waiter on blast because maybe he was having an off-day or perhaps he was dealing with difficult customers (who knows)...but let's call him M. M greeted us nicely as soon as we sat down, he asked for our drinks. We quickly received our drinks and then he asked for our order. We weren't ready yet so he left to give us more time. Fine right? Well, he gave us too much time...we were waiting patiently for him to assist us however he was nowhere to be seen. Every time we needed M - he was either nowhere to be seen OR helping out other customers and quickly leaving. I tried raising my hand to get his attention (I didn't want to have to do that, but we've been waiting for too long). When that didn't work, I  stood up to try to get his attention! & when that didn't work, I would finally ask another waiter/waitress for what we wanted. To give you an idea, we waited about 30 mins to order our food and another 30 mins after eating to ask for our check. The restaurant wasn't even busy and in my opinion, it was over staffed. Ridiculous. The employees were unprofessional by walking together and huddling over by the registers/corners to gossip. I really don't want to hear about so and so's girlfriend being rude through text and what they did for the weekend -- while I'm trying to eat dinner with my family. We heard most of their conversations than our own. It's upsetting that while we needed assistance from M, there was literally a group of 5-6 employees hanging out in front of us laughing and talking.

He also doesn't know what an iron is or if he doesn't want to iron his shirt then he should take it to the dry cleaners.  -4 Stars (yes this means minus as well)- the wait time. I checked the bar because I didn't want to use a table for my party of one. It was full so I waited. They said 10-15 minutes and it was 22 minutes. I am not complaining about that. My issue is that there were more than 5 tables and more than 5 booths available when my wait time started. That is not including 4 tables outside and many many tables inside the garage door area. (I later found out that the tables in the garage area were reserved for a very large party). There were always a dozen or more parties in line before me and as I left while there were always 10+ tables clean and clear sitting for extended periods of time. When I was seated I got a booth that was available the entire time and 3 of the other bothers were still empty and 4 of the other tables were still empty.

I just left kaiser urgent care and was told that both my girlfriend and I have food poising which came from here because all we ate yesterday was BJs, we had saved our appetite thinking we were going to get a great meal but that did not happen. First off, we were given the wrong drink the waiter ended up bringing us the correct one but did not apologize for the error. Smh no customer service. It took about 20 mins just to order our appetizer and alcohol, I thought that was way too long, we got the meatballs which were pretty good and strawberry splash and pumpkin ale both were good. 30 mins later he came to take our order (mind you the waiter never gave us his name) we ordered the brisket bacon burger and parmesan crusted chicken. Now here is where I probably should of sent the food back or complained which was my fault because I didn't we already waited over an hour just to eat and we were starving, well the burger and bacon were under cooked burger was medium when we asked for well done and the bacon was soft and soggy no crisp what so ever. The parmesan crusted chicken was cold and really over cooked extremely dry and lacked flavor it really fooled us because the food was platted nicely. The quality lacked tremendously. We also decided to order the trio pizooki, the monkey bread was burned and dry, the cookies n creme and chocolate chunk were good. They were the best part of our meal. Overall, would not recommend or return to this resturant. We ended up waisting 70$ for a meal that caused food poising. Smh. We will just continue to go to the cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia?start=60,1.96,2.16,2.428,2.308,2.08

5,Derek D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",139,1,,5.0,2017-11-24,"I'm about to get one of my front teeth pulled, but that's beside the point... In the late 1990's, during the development of this particular establishment, a precious metal more valuable than gold and more powerful than kryptonite was unearthed. Unaware of the inherent power of this precious element, the modest construction workers discarded the stone into a nearby California brush fire, ultimately kilning the rock into a glowing molten mass. Five years later, the Pepsi Cola company filmed a commercial starring William H. Macy on location at Six Flags Magic Mountain... It is said that Mr. William Macy rediscovered these precious stones himself during an interval of spiritual enlightenment and molded the rock into the plates and bowls they use specifically at this BJ's restaurant to this day. Legit?? I think so... But I'll leave that decision up to you. The servers and bartenders at this BJ's continue to carry on the legacy of William H. Macy, and will gladly engage themselves in casual conversation of his personal history if you ask them. I frequent this restaurant often to be reminded of this. Tip: Before you leave, look towards the palm tree on your left. Jesus will see you and give you a wink of approval. Once you tip your hat towards the North star, you will see fireworks on the horizon. That's when you know the coast is clear. Your Pizookie will be waiting for you in the dirty fish tank when you get home.  Hurry up... They're onto us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valencia,2.44,2.26,2.4,,2.332

The waiter, for some reason, kept acting like we weren't together and took our drink and food orders separately - which yep, meant one table was halfway done before the other table got their food. 3) You may be thinking that maybe he didn't know we were together? Nope, both tables made sure to tell him that it was my cousins birthday and when the second table told him he said, ""yeah I heard"" and then never brought the free pizookie out.  4) My $17 seared tuna salad, which came out last after everyone else's food, was obviously pre-seared and put in the fridge...because it was ice cold all the way through.

51,Chad C.,"Glendale, CA",30,3,,2.0,2017-11-29,"Hello, we visited BJ's on Sunday 11/27/17, and the service was really bad. We did the call ahead seating and were seated right after arriving. The table we were placed had direct A/C air on it and very low lighting, forcing us to use our phone lights to see the menus. Our waitress was servicing the neighboring tables and did not greet us. We flagged her down to ask about the air and possibly adjusting the A/C. She said she would check and then asked for our drink order. She told us a particular tea was hot (which we wanted) which it turned out was wrong as it came out on ice. She then walked away and vanished. Then 15 minutes went by and she did not return nor deliver our drinks. I walked to the hostess and told them we were not getting any service and they said they would take care of it. A few minutes after, a new waitress came by and asked if she could take our order for food. We said we had not received our drinks yet. She said sorry and took our drink order. Then she walked away and the 1st server arrived at our table and said, ""I thought you all had left"", as though that was the reason she never returned with our drinks. We said all we did was moved to the table next to us which had much better light and no direct A/C. After that, my wife went to talk to the manager. We then saw the manager talking to his staff. He stopped by our table and said sorry for the slow service as they were under staffed. We replied saying the server said she thought we had left just we only moved one table over. So that was not true but he decided to ignore that point. He said he was taking care of things for us. So we got our corrected drinks and food just the sweet potato fries were cold, the wings were supposed to have sauce just they had dry rub seasoning on them. The wait staff obviously needs to know the menus better and take care of their customers better. Also was surprised that the manager did not return after to make sure everything was good. Bad management. He did pay for our desert and removed the fries and wings from the bill.

Not a big order not a hard order right ? So after about 20min i start to get a little irritated as all we revived thus far was our drinks no appetizers!!! Mind you again it's dead in here no busy at all. The server comes by asking us is ""we were okay"". I tell her no at this point we been here about 30min with no appetizers.
