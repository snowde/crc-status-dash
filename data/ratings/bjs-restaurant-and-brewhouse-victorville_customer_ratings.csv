124,Erin B.,"Hesperia, CA",98,30,4.0,5.0,2016-02-21,"HUGE TIP: Download the BJs Mobile app and become a member prior to going! You'll get to skip the outrageous wait time using it and many more benefits!!! So excited we were able to try our newest local BJs!  I asked my husband tonight if he wanted to go try out BJs and he was a little hesitant cause it being a Saturday night on the week it opened he new it was going to be packed. I told him to download the BJs app on his phone and check out about their preferred waiting list I've been hearing all about. He did and was able to put our name in from the mobile app. It said the wait was at an hour. Perfect time to drop off our daughter and get there. We arrived a few minutes before our checkin time and the staff did tell us for FUTURE REFERENCE- if we are to put our name in with the app we have to be there to checkin at 30 minutes prior to expected being called or you automatically get booted from the system (so take note) but he was more than happy to add us back in our place on the list which was awesome cause the wait was, not joking, 4 hours! So we waited about 15 minutes after checking in which wasn't bad at all. We were pretty happy! I also love how they page you via text message when your table is ready- no wonder why there wasn't 4 hours worth of waiting people in the waiting area. We were seated and greeted by our waitress. I believe her name was Tara. She was super nice and very helpful with her suggestions. She recommended for me a non alcoholic half strawberry lemonade and half Sierra Mist which was sooooooo delicious and my husband expanded his horizon by ordering a new beer she recommended. The food was also very delicious. Was a little wait to receive our entrees but I ordered salmon and it was very busy so we didn't mind a little delay. At the end we were so stuffed and satisfied and even paid our bill using the awesome BJs mobile app we downloaded prior to getting there. Very awesome and impressive! Anyways our first overall experience here was an amazing one and we look forward to being BJ members and returning... Hopefully we won't be so full next time so we can order an appealing pizookie!

We were definitely not disappointed. The pizza is just as good if not better than down the hill. The only downfall was it was very busy and the wait what kind of long for food. But that's to be expected since it just opened up. The service was good and the people were very nice.

Today is my first time at the Victorville location i get here and i was greeted very nicely when i tell the employee at the front that i already ordered my food no one had an idea how to look up my name or seating she then called another employee which didnt know either she then called the general manager which didnt know either. Finally the girl who helped me at first found a way to do it. A waiter then seated us and gave us menus and asked if we wanted something to drink i said i PREORDERED my food and drinks already he said ok and he would see where our food was i waited they were out of strawberry lemonade i ordered a pineapple juice for myself and they brought me a kids size when i had just told my waitress it was a big size for myself i am still sitting here im pretty sure they know im upset because the manager came without me even asking her to come. I also asked for avocado egg rolls they did not have them either my daughter ordered mini corn dogs they gave her grilled cheese sandwhich i will never come here again and continue to dine at the montebello location that has exceptional service with a great staff,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville?start=260,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

242,Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,372,181.0,3.0,2016-02-24,"NOTE: An up-the-hill 3 is more like a down-the-hill 2. I have not been to a BJs (phrasing) since my one and only visit in 2003 to the one in Westwood with classmates at UCLA. I remember the pizza being not real Chicago deep dish (not that I care as I am a NY/Brooklyn pizza snob) and not very good, but enjoying the pizookie (though it was too sweet) the table was sharing. Hostess and servers were all very nice. Moe (no relation to Szyslak, and probably not a 'mo, though I'm of course not judgin' if he is) was friendly and nice, especially since it took us so long to get through the bible of a menu and pick something. He was attentive and quick throughout our meal, and (managers take note!) was the best part of our visit. The food was not that great. The best things we had were the housemade sodas (favorites being root beer and black cherry) and the avocado egg rolls. We could see coming back just for that. The entrees were weak and made me afraid to try other items if/when we come back. We had fish and chips and parmesan crusted chicken. Fish had too much breading, with such small pieces of fish inside that even though the first bite was moist and delicious they quickly dried out by the time we started the 2nd or 3rd piece. Shoestring french fries were only okay, though dousing them with malt vinegar always helps. The chicken sounded like something that would have been delicious at Cheesecake Factory but was just overly salty and had no depth of flavor. Mashed potatoes tasted like the kind from a box, dry and not very buttery. I had to dig into the middle to get some that wasn't hardened. We ordered a pizookie trio consisting of peanut butter, triple chocolate, and salted caramel. The caramel was the best, though I was not sure I found any of the advertised ""pretzel bites"" in it (I think I may have but it just tasted like chocolate chunks with salt in them). Peanut butter was marred by whole peanuts that made it hard to eat (though YMMV if you like whole nuts). Triple chocolate was too rich. All three were way too sweet (as expected) and we left over half of each. It was apparently happy hour and we were pleasantly surprised to see our appetizer was $2 off. We left a 25% tip. The basketball game on during our visit has no bearing on this review but I am noting it here. As foodies it was of particular interest to us that one of the teams competing was that of the CIA (Culinary Institute of America). We saw clips of the players cooking, and the fans in the stands had a banner that read ""Yes, Chef!"""" (a phrase that kitchen staff often have to say to the head chef).

He made sure our food was made to how we wanted, he even had one of our pizzas remade because he wasn't satisfied with what he would've brought out, he made more green tea for us when there wasn't any, and he had the best attitude!

The food was pretty good, compared to the ones down the hill. The waitress was really nice and our food was brought out really fast. My Newcastle was delicious, and I want to go back to try the bar out.  I think anything below a 4 star review is a little dramatic.

WOW.  The manager Todd answered, I let him know no one ever acknowledged us.  He said he was very sorry, and that the employees are still trying to figure things out.  I told him how there were several employees standing around that could have helped us.  Then he said, ""oh, uh, we were having a shift change.""  Okay.  I thought, good excuse.  WOW. Red Robin sat us within in 3 minutes, and took our drink order under one minute of sitting down.  As soon as we received our drinks, we placed our food order.  Our food was delivered to our table within 12 minutes.  BIG DIFFERENCE of service between the horrible experience at BJs and great one at Red Robin.  The server at Red Robin was very nice and sincere in his work too!!  Food was plated perfectly, flavor was amazing, and temperature was great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville?start=200,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.2760000000000002,3.3200000000000003

Second time around today was not so good. Food was great though, can't complain about that. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or what. Some things were out of her control I understand. However other things weren't. Our pepsi's were flat and when we requested a change of soda, she hesitated before bringing us new ones. Then our food all came out except our pizza, which 3 of us were sharing, took about 30 minutes to come out. 20 min into it she came to apologize and explain that the waiter that was bringing it out dropped it and so they were making us a new one. 10 min later pizza came out and I was still suspecting whether it was the dropped one or not because it was so fast. We asked her for paper towels and a wet towel because my daughter had ordered ribs.  She forgot and we had to ask her again, when we asked her she said she only had paper towels but no wet towels. Something she could have told us the first time around. She refilled 2 drinks for others expect mine. We ordered a dessert that took about 15 minutes to come out and then we waiting about another 10 for the check. When the check came she had charged us two pizzas, when we only had ordered one. To change the check it took 10 minutes. Our check was about $100 bucks and she's lucky we gave her $5 bucks tip.

Asked to put the game on to the waitress...I guess she checked but did not come back. So, asked someone else and the manager came back and said they don't have that channel. Darn it!

265,La Shawn G.,"Victorville, CA",6,8,,1.0,2016-03-24,"I'm am up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning writing you to express how sad I am about my families experience last night at your Victorville's Resturant. I want to start off saying that last night was a very special night for my family and we planned to end it at BJs to share a meal with close friends and family. Mind you we just moved here about 9 months ago from Temecula. That team there including management has always made us feel welcomed and appreciated, if there was a problem right away the management would take care of it. So just FYI I give that store a 10/10. Back to the issue at hand, March 23, 2016 our party of 20 walked into BJs excited to have some drinks and to dig into a great meal. My family and I already knew what we where going to order because we had our all time favorites dishes on our minds including my 10 and 11 year old child. We even had a 14 year old friend visiting from Temecula so she knows how BJs service is usually. The two servers greeted us promptly with awesome smiles on their faces so we were under the impression that the whole night was going to be a success. To our disappointment for my family of 5 plus our visiting friend it was a disaster. The female server which I'm sorry I can't recall her name took our drink order and didn't even come back until our friends were on to their refills of their strawberry lemonades. My husband and I didn't even get our two waters that we ordered. I think the bartender brought us our two beers. By this time the friendly and very attentive male server Edgar was taking our friends orders. My family and I sat and waited and waited until I flagged a very nice host down to ask if he could please get our server for us. And he did, she was over at another table that got there I think after us taking there order and didn't even come back to our table to acknowledged that she didn't take our order or even give us the courtesy to let us know but she turned this over to Edgar. We stopped Edgar and he took our order and said, ""I'm sorry she got really busy and asked me to take your order."" By this time our friends received half their appetizers. And 5 to 10 minutes late to receive their meals. My husband and I told a male manager what hand took place and to cancel our orders because our friends were done eating and ready to go home by that time which was 9:20ish. To be totally honest it felt like he didn't really care and he said he would cancel it but that wasn't enough for me because I thought to myself where can we find a place to feed our 10&11 year old this late at night? So I asked for the other manager she was female and very apologetic. She said ""I told the kitchen to get right on it wait they should've beat me out here, wasn't your food the burger and the ribs?"" We said no, I don't even know if our food ever even got ordered. We said could we have our check please and they gave it to us it was $13.18 and we tipped Edgar $10 because we know that if you would've started off being our server he would did great. The female Manager offered to make some food for us to go and we said no thank you and she brought us a gift card of $25 for the next time and gave the girls two desserts but my husband said he doesn't want ever go to the Victorville one the again. If we go to BJs we will go back to the Temecula one. We ended up taking our sleepy children through the drive thru of In and Out. Obviously, this is still affecting me that I'm up early in the morning writing to corporate. I know this was a eye full but thanks for taking the time to read it. Please express to Edgar M server number 401 and the male host that they did a great job.  And if I would consider ever going back I would ask for his section. And express to management of Victorville to please make sure that not one more family experience that kind of servers again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville?start=260,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.084,3.0000000000000004

Instead of having them fix the order because I was in a hurry I just asked for a side of buffalo sauce for the wings.

211,Steven O.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,18,1.0,2.0,2016-05-05,"As a family that goes out to eat at least 3 days per week, I thought I would try the new BJ's in Victorville. On my first visit my mind was blown as I walked in the door, the restaurant is open and airy, the booths very, very, comfortable, the bar inviting, and the staff top notch and really friendly. I wish I could say the same about the food (I tried). The first time we came I ordered the ribs and mashed potatoes. The ribs were not tender and the mashed, cold. The salad was good as was the iced tea. My wife ordered the salmon, she loved it. I decided to give BJ's one more try, thinking all restaurants might have a bad day or two right? So we went again, my wife got the Salmon, she loved it again, our friend got the Fish and Chips, she adored it, i thought i would try the Sirloin Steak/baked potato/caesar salad. Once again my meal was not good at all, I have had better steaks at Denny's! The steak was small, tough as a shoe and the baked potato very cold. The caesar salad was good as was the ice tea. I tried the fish and chips and it was really good. So my advice to you is stay away from meat stuff, the ribs, steaks, hamburgers are not worthy. My son said ""Dad this restaurant is known for it's beer and pizza"" so you should not complain. Well I have never tried the beer and pizza so maybe he is right, but if you are going to put other choices on the menu, they should be top notch right or at least kind of good? I mean when is the last time the manager ordered a steak from his own restaurant? i have to say the waitress warned me about the steak, I should have listened, or if she knows it's not good, then maybe management should make some changes right? Because if she knows, then they know (if they are good leaders) I will not go back. The wait time is very long for dinner, and if you don't use the App to call in, you will sit there a long time watching folks walk in and get a table really quick, kind of makes you a little angry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville?start=240,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.088,2.52

With that being said this location had great service and food from whah I expect of BJs. My friend and I came for dinner and our 45 minute wait was drastically cut down to less than 5 minutes. Our server was great and even let my friend order lunch items even though it was dinner time.

Everyone loved their food. From the seafood tacos, chicken Alfredo, burgers, chicken strips to the salmon - it was all great! Although I previously complained that their menu was huge, it appears that they can cook that menu well. They have a huge selection of beers and soda. The place is very big inside and they can seat a lot of people in there. I recommend you join their reward program. After you do that you can put yourself on their preferred seating list. This lets you put up to 6 people in line so when you get there your wait is not that long, because this place can get insanely busy. You can even place your order ahead of time so as soon as the hostess seats you the kitchen will immediately fire your order Lastly, before we left Krissy brought my father-in-law and I, a father's day glass and a 20% off coupon, even though father's day was today.

When we first arrived I noticed that the parking lot was full with no open spots close by. I wasn't surprised because it's a new restaurant! I was able to find a spot on the dirt hill no problem because I have a truck and wanted to park there!!! The restaurant is located near a hotel that's sharing the parking so it's to be expected.  No worries, I can walk a few more feet to get some good food.  The restaurant was packed but we were greeted with smiles and plesentries from the hosts. Our wait time was about 3 min. I see other reviews complaining about the wait time. If you don't want to wait then try eating at home or don't show up at the same time everyone else is going out to dinner. My wife and I arrived around 8:30. It's that simple... Anyways, we ordered our steak and ribs dinners. The ""wait time"" for our food was normal. When my wife's steak showed up she found a hair near it on the plate. The waitress was right there and saw the hair too, so they both decided it would be best to replace that steak for a new one. We know this kind of stuff happens because we are all human and it has happened at my house too. The food was replaced with fresh food so we moved on. We had steak, ribs, chicken w/bacon, shrimp, mashed patatoes, salad, and greens. Our food was outstanding, never better, like my tastbuds were in heaven with every bite good. Honestly, I was not expecting anything from BJ's  because of the hair incident because her food was replaced and the staff apologized more than once. Things happen, no worries was our thoughts on the matter. However, the floor management made an effort to stop by more than once to check on us, give us a gift card for our next visit, and a free desert with our dinner. And for that I salute you.

I had a Pizookie, which is a warm baked cookie in a pan with vanilla ice cream (I recommend the macadamia nut one) If you can't decide get the trio and pick three that sound good to you. My husband had a burger medium well. He asked for cheese but it didn't come to the table with cheese he didn't say anything because he was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. For the appetizer we had stuffed mushrooms they all came in very different sizes ok whatever not mushrooms are created equal I guess. Mushrooms had too much creamy cilantro sauce on them it over powered the dish. It was supposed to be stuffed with spinach but I tasted more fillers than anything.

149,Brandi W.,"Victorville, CA",22,6,4.0,1.0,2016-08-10,"1 star specifically based on the way the manager Javier (I think) treated me tonight! I've NEVER felt so disrespected in my life! I LOVE BJ'S Resturant anywhere I go! I eat there so much my family gets sick of it  because I'm addicted to certain dishes!  Anyway I was over the top excited when this location opened and I'm literally there ALL the time including opening day so unfortunately I may experience issues more often than others like food not cooked correctly, incorrect dishes sent to my table, my gift card balance applied to someone else's bill ( to find out when I'm having lunch another day and it was at a zero balance; I had to pay cash) I had corporate investigate where my money went it took two days but they compensated me well for their mistake, my app points being negative & not increasing etc. Tonight I encountered a mgr that I dealt with a couple times. I had an ""internal"" issue because tonight I didn't feel comfortable with my waitress, felt ignored ( when she walked right past my table) got up to add to my order when her and that mgr was standing at the register & I was upset! I proceeded to make a comment about adding to my order, being ignored, and wanting to switch waitresses ( never done before) and instead he walked away from the register off to the side and told me he doesn't have any other seating ( um a lie) and he wasn't going to change my waitress but he will take my add on! He said you seem to have a ""problem"" every time you come here and if it was me I wouldn't keep coming back! I told him I don't come here for you or the people I'm here because I ""love"" the food! Btw 99% of the issues are an internal training issue but  I've also had great experiences with other mgrs and waitresses so it's for you to get it right not for me to never come back here! He told me that he was offended that I didn't want to be served by his waitress and what if I was told that a waitress didn't want to be served by a customer (btw she didn't say that he was just being condescending) I told him then it's your job as the mgr to remove your employee from the situation just like its his job to remove the waitress if I don't feel comfortable with her serving my food! I told him he can't force me to be served by someone that I no longer feel comfortable with and she's serving my food he doesn't get to make that decision! He told me he wasn't going to move me! I told him your not listening I never asked to be moved I want the waitress to be removed! Then I proceeded to get him straight and breakdown all the problems that I had since opening day and how I'm a very frequent customer and unlike others who won't complain or tell you it's okay I'm going to let you know because your collecting my money and it's not okay! It went on and on too long for this comment! Then he proceeded to say well I'll take your add on what do you want? I told him but seconds later I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE I didn't want his service. By that time what my husband ordered was already coming out! He brought it to the table asked us to taste the wings if they were cooked well enough & I said I won't and I don't trust you serving my food & I'm not eating any! He said so you don't want the wings I just ordered for you I said no you made me feel so uncomfortable that I don't trust your service! He said well let me go tell the cook! 5 minutes later he sent the wings out with another mgr and he was with him to ask if we still wanted the wings or take them to go? I said I want no part of it! So sat there and only had lemonade! Btw I forgot to mention he finally sent another waitress in between that and she was nice! But this visit was a NIGHTMARE because of him! I've had issues there but the mgr Alley and another Mgr handled it like professionals and had some great waiters and waitresses! There's been times that Ive eaten at BJS 3x a week so my face is easily noticed and if I have an issue its their job to make it right and I'm gonna let it be known! The WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD ANYWHERE! This comment can't do the experience justice! I will be calling corporate tomorrow! I don't want ANYTHING from them as compensation they need to give this guy a training lesson in etiquette, customer service, and management! He said his personal opinion is the people run the Resturant and if it was him he wouldn't come back! Told me he will give me a different waitress this time! Wow!

94,Mary J.,"Seattle, WA",411,169,230.0,1.0,2016-08-15,"BJ's is a brewery chain, found in many states. The thing I love about BJ's food is the taste, wide selection and large portions. My favorite is the avocado egg rolls. The sweet sauce that it comes with complements the rolls well. Most times, I just go to BJ's for the avocado egg rolls. I used to go for the baked potatoes- they're loaded, gigantic and amazing. Unfortunately, this particular BJ's location gets 1 star mainly because the service was poor. Not that we got any attitude from the staff, but they just kept getting things wrong repeatedly, the wait was long for sauce, and some of the servers/ waiters looked pretty complacent at times (walking around ignoring customers) on a fairly busy night. Our server seemed like a nice guy, but you could tell that other servers weren't really listening or the communication was really poor overall between the staff. It was a Wednesday Night, I went with a party of 5, and the place was packed. My cousin ordered her chowder in a bread bowl. It arrived in a regular bowl. She had to flag down several waiters/ servers for her order in the bread bowl. Took forever to get a servers attention, each time taking 10-15 minutes of waiting and following up. The rest of us were finishing our meals and servers had brought my cousin's clam chowder soup in a regular bowl incorrectly THREE TIMES before they finally brought it in a bread bowl. It was pretty upsetting for my cousin.  There was no discount and they still made my cousin pay full price for the meal. They lost a customer for life. Also, when I asked for more sweet sauce for the avocado egg rolls, they brought me SOY SAUCE. I gave up after that. Get it together, BJ's of Victorville.

When I asked her about the mistake on our check she stated "" you only get one bazookie for free"" I felt so mislead and manipulated I felt like she just wanted a higher percentage for her Tip by having a higher bill. I asked her why she told us it was free? She didn't have an answer she said "" I meant just one"" . What a rip off and what a set up.

Extremely slow and inattentive service even though we (party of 6) came in well before the dinner rush. We had 3 different servers. The meals took quite long time and when they arrived half were cold. We had to ask for water and beverage refills. We were told the pizookies were delayed because a server dropped all of them. So, finally the check...it took over 45 minutes to get right. We were told the 1st server did not do the check right when she took our orders, which we understood, but why did we have to wait almost an hour to close out our checks? Even after we helped get the check right by lettering (A-B-C) which meals go together, it still took several attempts to get it right. The manager said the 1st server had been on shift since the morning and that the chef will need to do better, but didn't seem to understand that it was not just that.  We explained the entire 3-hour experience was horrible and unacceptable. The manager gave us coupons for complimentary pizookies.

We waited at the table for about 10 minutes looking over the menu before our server came to the table to introduce herself and get our drink and appetizer order. It was another 15 minutes before getting our drinks and appetizer. By then we were beyond ready to order so we placed our order when our drinks were brought the the table. Overall the ambience is like any other BJs. It's relaxing and laid back. The service was extremely SLOW. There were long intervals before seeing our server. At last our food was brought out in increments.  We had to wait a few minutes before even being able to eat our food because we had to wait for the server to return to ask for silverware. Seemed like two meals came out at a time (we were a party of six) My son ordered a soup as his entree and watched us eat half of our food before he got his broccoli cheddar soup. Overall, the service is SLOW and a bit on the inefficient side. The place is clean and the food is good but seems as if the service is lacking.

185,Angie O.,"Phelan, CA",70,47,30.0,1.0,2016-12-04,"If I could give no stars I would. On Friday night I placed on order online for food. Right after placing the order the waitress called to confirm my order. We arrived at 6pm which was the time it told us to be there. When the food came to us a pizza was missing. After the waitress looked at the bill she realized she did miss it after me telling her several times. So we waited with part our order while she got the other pizza ordered. While waiting we decided to eat our cheese pizza with half pepperoni. I opened the box and it literally had only half cheese, the other half only had pepperoni! (I even confirmed my order on the phone with her previously). So when she comes back out to bring us our other pizza (20minutes later) I have her take back the cheese pizza to get it right and she brings me 2 stupid coupons for free kids meals and a free poozie which I thought was insulting. Another 20 minutes go by and a different lady brings us the cheese but now it's the wrong size & it was cold and hard! I told the new lady who supposily was the manager Krissy just to refund us the difference and will keep these because now after waiting 45 minutes my little ones were crying and hungry. Another 5 minutes goes by and our original waitress comes out to complete our bill which we paid over $75 for! By now all of our food was cold. Here's the kicker... so I was so flustered that we drove away without getting our change for the difference so I call and speak TO THE MANAGER Krissy who says ""don't worry I will email you a gift card that will be more that substantial to feed your entire family next time you come in"" this is a quote directly from her. So the next day no gift card so I call and speak to her and she tells me it has to be approved by the general manager and then will be emailed. So right now (another day later) I get a call from a manager named Jose who says their system isn't working and wants to mail me a $25 gift card. I told him what Krissy had said about a substantial amount.... so he says I'll call you back which he did and said ok we will send you $50. Wow what a slap in the face Krissy, after wasting our time and messing up our order and us wasting our money on cold food, you should be ashamed of yourself BJs!  Update... The Real general manager from BJs called me,his name was Mike. He was very nice and very apologetic and right away told me he was going to credit us back our bill, which he did. He said he will work with the staff on issues like these and how to prevent and avoid them. Honestly I would have never written this review if they would of done what was right in the first place and comp our meal. It was wasted anyways.

When the food finally came -- actually it didn't all come out at once, five out the six orders came out then maybe 10 minutes later the final time (Soup) came out -- we could not eat since we were not given utensils or napkins. We also did not get crayons with the kids menus.

120,Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27.0,5.0,2016-12-09,"Great Experience became even better because of their employees Honesty! I'm a frequent BJ's visitor and from previous reviews you will see it's always a Hit or Miss... Never have I given a BJ's location a perfect 5 until now and it's all because of their service and in the end Honesty! As we were driving back from Las Vegas me and my wife decided to stop at this local BJ's in Victorville as we were in the mood for some wings and their flat bread pizza!! From the beginning the hostess was attentive and prompt as we walked in and gave us our options of waiting for 15-25 minutes for seating or taking an open seat at the bar area... we were tired so decided to have a seat at a table in the bar area so we could just sit down relax and order our food. I'll be honest I've learned not expect a lot from the service at BJ's restaurants based on previous experiences but I gotta say I was surprised, CJ our waiter was courteous, attentive and had a great big smile and personality every time he came to check on us and it was always at the right time. We had been driving all day so I didn't notice I still had my glasses on my head, when I realized this I set them down on the table to relax. Soon after the wings and pizza came out. They put the tray for the pizza over my glasses so I didn't notice they were under the tray throughout the night and completely forgot about them. CJ was awesome and so were all the waiters and employees as they all smiled and asked if we needed anything every time their was an opportunity. The food as always was great and ambience was awesome even though they were packed! (Normally the times I've been to a BJ's and they're packed like this, the service tends to go down hill as they are completely understaffed which in this case and in this restaurant they weren't) I proceeded to do a mobile check out and pay my bill while CJ was catering to other tables. He then asked us when he came by afterwards would you like desert, hang out or your bill? I said we already paid online. Oh perfect he said mobile checkout got it! Then hang out as long as you wish and if you need anything i'll still be here for you guys!!!! With a big genuine smile....not a fake it till you make it smile! Dinner was so smooth and great that when we left I didn't notice I left my glasses which I had just purchased that morning and was hesitant to buy in case I lost them sometime in the near future but I said ok I won't lose these so I bought them. Once I realized 20 minutes afterwards I had left them I immediately called the manager Cassidy (who even thru my angry tirade at first was genuinely carrying and nice) to let her know I had left them. She let me know that no one had found them and would call me back if they turned up.... Ill be honest at first I thought I had just got jacked from one of their bus boys or even CJ and was getting lip service from the manager now about not finding them or caring. So I gave her my phone number as she requested from me and my name and promised if they turned up that she would call me. Sayonara I thought they'll never turn up I almost even told her don't worry about it and didn't give her my number as I was so upset but did anyway.... Well I gotta say I wish I could take all my negative thoughts back and truly feel bad for not thinking their were still good honest people in the world and especially for thinking that CJ would have taken my glasses because 15 minutes later Cassidy called me back to tell me they had found them and wanted to know how she could get them back to me as timely as possible.... I felt as small as I ever have in my life at that moment! ALL BJ's NEED TO TAKE A LESSON OR TWO FROM THIS LOCATION! Awesome food, Awesome Service but most of all AWESOME STAFF AND PEOPLE!

172,Terry W.,"Ontario, CA",0,9,3.0,1.0,2016-12-13,"Yuck! I took my sister here thinking it was a nice restaurant. I don't even understand the menu. Why would someone go to a restaurant for pizza when there so many good pizza places around? But if you don't order the pizza you're going to be out of luck getting anything decent to eat. I ordered the fish and chips; could've done better with Vandecamps from the grocery store. The fish was thin preformed patties and the shoestring potatoes were just cheap frozen potatoes and they were very poorly cooked. Completely unappetizing. Honestly I cannot even figure how this place can stay in business. It must be the alcohol people go here and drink and then the food doesn't matter. After an hour we stood up to leave and suddenly our food came. We complained to the waiter about the wait; he got a blank look on his face, turned on his heel and walked away without saying a word. He did not apologize or even acknowledge that we had spoken. However he did get the manager who came over and discounted our meal. She said that they were shortstaffed because of a school fundraiser. While I understand that what I can't forgive them is that no one came to our table for almost an hour to explain to us what was going on. We couldn't even get the attention of a server. my sister ordered a pasta dish that was also disgusting.

132,Y T.,"Victorville, CA",0,11,,2.0,2016-12-21,"We went to the BJ's in Victorville to celebrate 2 friends birthday on a Tuesday night.  We had a party of 11, therefore we had to wait to be seated. OMG, we could not believe that it took over an hour to be seated.  Luckily we hadn't seen some of them in a while and we were catching up.   When we were finally seated, because of our parties size the hostess told us that we would  be assigned 2 waitresses.  It seems like they gave us the rudest, most sarcastic waitresses that that they have.  Only one of them ended up taking our drink orders.  First she said that she was going to just take our drink orders but, she came back around and also took our food orders.  She also told us because of the size of the party that we would have to put all of our food and drinks on one bill or we could have up to 4 bills for our table. Other restaurants can separate the bills, why can't BJ's? Back to our service.  The 2nd waitress did help bring the drinks out.  Almost everyone received their drink orders, well except me and one other person.  I only asked for water with lemons. When I finally got my water it was so full of lemons.  Maybe they thought I wanted to make my own lemonade! I wanted extra lemons, but that was rude and ridiculous. Our original waitress had to leave because it was the end of her shift.  I was so glad she had to leave.  The relief waitress was much nicer.  I don't know what happened to the other rude waitress.  Maybe it was the end of her shift as well.

61,Harley C.,"Victorville, CA",0,22,3.0,5.0,2017-01-05,"So I should start out by mentioning that this review is slightly biased by the fact that I work at a neighboring restaurant, so perhaps I'm slightly more forgiving than other reviewers. But overall the experience was 5 stars. It probably helped that I called ahead and it was just for two. The call ahead system is excellent. We were even sat early despite the fact it was Saturday night and it was packed. Cozy 2 top table for just my wife and I. I've heard from others that the quality of your experience is dependent on your server. Ours was fine. Unfortunately I don't remember her name. Not overly attentive but she didn't ignore us either.  Now the food and drink: my wife ordered something fruity I don't remember what it was but she liked it. I got a house IPA. It's decent but they have better ones. No matter what you can't beat having a place in the high desert with an actual decent beer selection. We ordered pizza. It's a pizza joint. Get a pizza. Came out in a timely fashion and was delicious as I expected. Their pizza is quality. For dessert we got the lemon white chocolate pizza. That's where I knocked a star off. It was kinda disappointing. Tasted good but was doughy in the middle and hard on the edges.  Overall in my opinion people are being a little hard on this location in their reviews. It's new. Of course there's gonna be issues. New restaurants always struggle for a bit til they weed out the weak staff. Give them a chance if you want some decent pizza and beer.  Update: this is a regular spot for my wife and I now. As well as coworkers. Drinks are good. Happy hour is awesome.

With the deals(Mother's Day special)  and coupons (free appetizer when you buy a meal over 10$),  I got my whole order for 29$! What a deal right?! The food was AMAZING!

I see a lot of reviews that basically says this BJ's location ain't shit, and MAYBE it might be true on the ""Dine-In"" part, but I did make an order on the to-go side because it was packed as hell and we wanted to get back to our side of the world (because you know, Victorville really is another world up there LOL)  However, I would definitely eat there because the food is great.  The service from ""Zachari M"" (very cool white boy! Yes, I can say white boy because I am half white LOL)  He was amazing! very patient, and so nice.  We had a few issues with my gift card, and he got the really awesome Mexican manager to fix it all up (You know us Mexicans have the answers / ability to fix anything) and it was an estimated 30 min wait but they got me in and out in less than 15 mins tops.  For the complainers that swear they're going to die because of waiting to get their food, my suggestion is order the boneless buffalo wings and calm down, lol. You'll be alright. You are not yourself when you're hungry.  As I was waiting in the to-go part of the restaurant, I really noticed it wasn't as bad as everyone says. The place is clean, has a great staff, and the food is worth the money. So, I will definitely be coming back to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville,3.0,3.23,3.23,2.9960000000000004,3.138

90,H C W.,"Adelanto, CA",267,137,144.0,1.0,2017-09-04,Definitely disappointed with last visit. One of my favorites is the baby backs ribs. Visited in the day of the special. I had the soup and it was great. Took the rest of the meal home for a disappointing late afternoon. First before I left I was overcharged and didn't realize until after up mobile pay and the check was brought to the table. Had to wait for dinner to be delivered 10-15 mins then had to wait 10+ mins for the pazookie and then more time for the waitress to checkout error on check. Gave up and just left.  When I settle down ready to eat the ribs it was what I my taste buds prepared. Fatty and very little meat. No bbq sauce and just bland. Not giving up on BJ's just probably this one.

Server was already standing around talking to much every trip she took talking to co workers bad service. Asked for manager I asked to be comped for my meal and said best she could is half on the steak and potato. Wife was ready to go so I didn't ask for GM wish I did. I work at red lobster and what I got from BJ's was horrible 4Th st in ontario bj always get good service and food.

The first server was really friendly and she put in complementary fruit and garlic knots for the kids and she took our order. We specifically asked for the spinach and artichoke dip and wings before our pizza. In 5 minutes the pizza was out and then after the appetizers. She apologized but that was no big deal. Then she said she was leaving and another young lady was going to take care of us. Yet she never left even when we left so idk. We ordered 3 pizookies and after I did the mobile pay and they never mentioned she was going to give us a complementary pizookie for what had happened before. So then she told us she would be right back and give us a coupon. We waited 15 minutes. A free pizookie is not worth that much of a wait and we ended up just leaving. Overall the staff is friendly but not trustworthy of what they say. Food was a 3 stars. Pizza  was great but the spinach dip the cheese was burned and the wings were overly seasoned. Not the best experience for a BJs.

When Elijah took our original order we had requested a side of ranch dressing come with the meal. Elijah checked on us as we were halfway through our meal and I had to remind him we never received our side of ranch. Overall, not a big deal.  The only negative part of this visit was that our empty dishes sat on our table for about 15 minutes. Several servers walked by our table and other tables without clearing them. I saw one server look directly at our dirty dishes, that I had stacked neatly for them at the end of my table, and they walked right on by. It's not just at BJ's - I see this a lot at other restaurants too. Management should do a better job of instilling the ""team concept"" in their employees. I waited tables when I was a kid and if we walked by any other server's tables we helped out and cleared them, or if you're walking by a table with a pot of coffee in your hand or a pitcher of tea...take care of the customer.

So rude so rude. First off my friend had ordered a beer and she slams the beer on the table and says don't know who ordered this and walks away with the worst attitude she made faces when we asked for things it got so bad to the point another young lady came to bring us some drinks I asked if she would please be our waitress because the lady that was serving us was so rude. She said okay and took care of us for the rest of the night she was lovely she had glasses. Sweet heart. At one point I look up and our old waiter was making faces and looking directly at us like she was speaking about us. SO RUDE.

Bottomline fresh sauce on cold food is a bummer, the pizookie coupons expired in June 2017 and Elijas was a trooper for having to do all this stuff that wasn't even his fault probably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville,3.32,3.14,3.088,,3.2120000000000006

It would've been a perfect visit to one of our favorite restaurants if it wasn't for the state of their bathroom.  Women's room. Second stall. Pee in the toilet for the entire duration of our almost 2 hours there, never once did an employee go in to clean it. I had almost 3 glasses of water so I got up to use the restroom twice and let me tell you I dreaded every moment of it. The smell was absolutely disgusting.  I expected better from you, BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville,3.48,3.19,3.096,,3.306

26,Richard G.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,1.0,2018-01-07,"One year ago I gave this location 5 stars. Sad to say I am dropping them down to a 1 stars because of the last few visits have been a major let down. Tonight we found 5 out 11 of our knives had hard food on them, long hair in the horse radish, the server dropped a drink on one of us. The A1 sauce that they provided us with was empty. My daughter even sent back her food and didn't get the chance to eat with the family because she was really disgusted with the restaurant.  I hope this location can fix you issues. Our family really loves coming here but after this I dont believe we will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville,3.36,3.14,3.092,,3.2280000000000006

21,Cindii J.,"Glendale, CA",2,44,1.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"I am very big at supporting our local community, I like eating here and support high dessert however this BJ's location has really left me with a horrible impression on both customer service and quality food service.  I am usually dine out 3 times per week, I don't do drive thru food so I rely on these type of restaurants to feed my family of 5 (including myself). I spend about $500 a week and which. If I'm going to spend $100+ per visit I expect a good hot meal.  -First of all, as I pulled up to curb side to go, I called them and it took them 17 minutes to come out to my car, they brought receipt for me to sign and made me wait 12 more minutes for my food. We were helped by a gentleman named Elias,  -Second, By the time I got home, my food was cold! I looked like it had been sitting for a while, I only live 5-6 Minutes away, this doesn't happen when I order from outback, Olive Garden, chili's etc (all next to each other or across the street).  -And third, the FOOD WAS HORRIBLE, NOT GOOD at all. The spaghetti was very dry and not enough sauce to cover the bottom of spaghetti. The blackened salmon was NOT blackened - it was pretty dry and not flavored. The asparagus penne sauce was mediocre - maybe if it was warm it would be good but again we got COLD FOOD. Garlic Parmesan wings were completely dry, as if hey forgot the sauce, the clam chowder soup was so thick as if we got the last of the bottom of their pot looked like jello. Cesar salads were good, I guess besucase it was also cold.  Very disappointed, from this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville,3.04,3.13,3.076,,3.094

Food and draft beers are great but the service is ok.  Visited VV BJ's three separate occasions and it's like the DMV out front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-victorville?start=20,3.12,3.11,3.072,,3.114
