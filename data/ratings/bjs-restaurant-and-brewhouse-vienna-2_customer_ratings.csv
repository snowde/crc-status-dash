183,Antonio M.,"Washington, DC",342,401,727.0,3.0,2013-10-25,"Nice huge open area. The bar has an immense tower of booze with probably one if the BIGGEST TVs I've ever seen! The staff are all friendly, attentive and well polished for such a new establishment. We had the calamari which was tasty and perfectly cooked. My entree was a creole tilapia. Which had a tasty fish covered in a sauce made of caper and olives. The fish was perfectly cooked although I didn't care for the sauce. The salt of the capers along with the bitter vinegar of the olives overpowered the entire dish. I preferred the fish on its own. My coworker had the chicken sandwich which came with a generous serving of Fred potato wedges. See pic  The service was spot on and very attentive. I was a bit surprised that their beer is not brewed in house but at some other location. I was really hoping to get some fresh brews here in the TyCo area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=180,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

We got the buffalo deep dish pizza, sesame chicken salad and the egg rolls. The portion here are pretty big. I liked the egg roll and the salad. Not the biggest fan of the deep dish. The crust is not crispy at all and it has too much breading. I had the pumpkin beer which I liked. The waiters were very nice and attentive. I'm looking forward to learn about their happy hour menu!

312,Michelle D.,"New Rochelle, NY",99,31,5.0,4.0,2013-10-31,"We came here for the soft opening of this BJ's in which there was a set menu and the dinner was free with the exception of drinks. I have been to many of the bjs restaurants in California and Vegas and have to say the service and food are usually the same across the board. If you have never been here which would be most people in this area since it's brand new, I 100% recommend it. The restaurant itself is the perfect place to watch sports games or to just hang out with friends. For a restaurant and brew house with games on... There aren't many places that can compare to the food and drinks and desert in that type of atmosphere. They usually have some sort of happy hour deals which with so many businesses around the area it really is perfect for after work drinks and food. Some of my personal favorite menu items.. The chicken wings appetizer, chicken potstickers,  baked potatoes and of course the pizookie! If you've never had one you must... I'm not sure if it's because this restaurant is brand new or what but the pizookie I had here the other night was probably the best one I've had. Definitely try it out if you haven't.. They've got a pretty diverse food and drink menu and just all around solid place to hang out with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=340,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

I tried the calamari & it was good, but average. I ordered the fish & chips(with wedge fries) and it was a large serving size. Fish was a bit over fried, but the fries were delicious. I also tried the bacon & cheddar burger. It had a great taste & good presentation. I had to send it back because it was undercooked. For dessert, I tried the hot cookie with ice cream (the Pizookie) & it was yummy!! This place has a very large (with ample seating) oval shaped bar in the center of the brewhouse! I love the decor.

I made a reservation and when we got there the place was fully packed. Huge tv's in the bar area (plus for going on a Sunday) they also have a couple tv's around the restaurant.  My friend and I are gluten free, so they had a separate gluten free menu (which I appreciate). Our server was wonderful and helped out patiently with the gluten free orders.    I got the blackened salmon salad, my salmon was cooked to perfection. Crisp around the edges and soft/tender in the middle. Loaded with plenty of delicious veggies and huge slices of fresh avocado to finish it off.    One of the girls got a gluten free pizza (with no cheese) but loaded it up with other toppings like chicken, mushrooms, onions, olives. She said her pizza was delicious.  Overall a great experience and Ill def be returning back.

159,Amanda M.,"Washington, DC",894,603,2931.0,2.0,2013-11-04,"When you first walk in you gotta love the bar - nice setup plus huge TV.  I'd definitely come here to chill and watch a game at the bar.   Now onto the food.... Make Your Own Deep Dish Pizza - so this is what I came for.  The dough was a tad bit undercooked and instead of a crispy hot crust I got a lukewarm doughy crust.  What's funny is that they brought the stand and then brought the pizza out with tongs and said it was very hot and when I looked there was no steam coming off the pizza and when I touched the pan it was lukewarm at best.  They basically could've carried it out on the palm of their hand.   Piranha® Pale Ale Chili and Cheese Potato  - this was the only potato listed on the menu.  The servers could not locate any other potatoes.  The potato was very plain and the chili was straight out of the can.  There were no green onions and the sour cream came later after eating about 1/3 of it.  The combo came with a salad that we barely touched - it seemed like an afterthought. The Corn Fritters was all dough and no corn.  Corn is super cheap - come on now!  Put some in there - don't call it a corn fritter with only 1 or 2 kernels of corns in each fritter. The Pizookie® Trio had undercooked cookies so tasted like raw dough so they all tasted the same even though we got red velvet, cookies n cream and triple chocolate. I did the beer sampler which allowed me to select 4 mini beers which were $6.95.  I loved that I was able to try different ones and would definitely come back again. And our server was very attentive. GOOD: Atmosphere, great beer and attentive service. BAD: The food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=80,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

Both were good, and the prices were good too. It's a large open area, so you don't feel cramped. Service was excellent, almost too much so. We must have had eight different people come by our table at various points. The problem was, many of them asked the same questions that we had already answered. I'm looking forward to going back and testing out the rest of the menu. Their beer menu is one of the best in tysons (not saying much), and much better than the crap lagers at Gordon Biersch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=220,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007
68,Jane T.,"Vienna, VA",31,5,4.0,4.0,2013-11-05,"I heard about BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse through a colleague of mine and how they were doing a week-long soft opening which included free food. Unfortunately, I heard it last minute and wasn't able to get a reservation in but I decided to go this past weekend. The location is easy to get to, just across from Tysons Corner mall off Leesburg Pike where Bertucci's used to be. Parking was a breeze and was easy to find. It was a cold evening, so it was nice that we could take the elevators from the garage straight to the restaurant. The restaurant is nice and open with lots of big screen TV's for you sports fanatics. We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess and was seated in a nice booth close to the bar. I don't drink beer, but my friend decided to order the eight glass beer sampler ($13) which was a great way to try out their handcrafted beers. In addition, we ordered two appetizers, the corn fritters (served with a bacon aioli) and ""EXXXXtra Hot' boneless wings. The corn fritters were good. Very soft, light, and fluffy. The boneless wings, however, were mediocre at best. They weren't very spicy (given my high tolerance for spicy food) and were dry, as in there was no sauce except for the ranch dipping sauce. Still tasty, but I probably wouldn't order those again. As for the entrees, we ordered the Grilled Burger Melt and Balsamic Glazed Chicken. I didn't get to taste the burger, but the Balsamic Glazed Chicken was simply delicious! It came with cheddar mashed potatoes, field greens, caramelized onions, crispy onion strings, and the glazed chicken. I definitely recommend if you want something on the semi-lighter side. Overall I had a great experience. The staff was super friendly, food was good, and the restaurant had a relaxed atmosphere. We didn't get to try their infamous ""Pizookies"", but we will definitely be going back to try that and more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=140,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

We received extremely friendly service (best I can recall --- welcomed by 3 people, great server, said bye/thanks by 4 people) but more importantly their beer and food were very good. We got the avocado rolls (awesome), Mediterranean deep dish pizza (really good), and club sandwich (average but good). My beer sampler was for the IPA (awesome/tasty/great hops), stout (heavy strong taste), robust porter (not very robust), nutty brown (good but tame).  We are looking forward to going back for dessert.

227,Vivian L.,"Potomac, MD",12,31,16.0,4.0,2013-11-10,"Yay!  They are finally open!  I've been to the BJ's in Westwood, CA and Laguna, CA, and was pleasantly surprised to see that they were opening up one in Tyson's Corner, VA.    Given that they have only just opened up, I was impressed with how smoothly the restaurant was running already.  Our food came out quickly, our ice teas were topped off several times, and our server Corey was very cordial and friendly. We ordered the avocado spring rolls as the appetizer (as suggested by Corey) and they were YUM-O!  For entree, we had the  Cobb salad and hand-tossed BJ's favorite pizza, which is basically a supreme pizza with the works.  I've only had the deep dish pizzas in the past, so this was something new.  It was delicious!  I don't know how they do it, but the hand-tossed pizza had a really thin crunchy layer at the bottom of the crust that was so good. BJ's is famous for their pizookie (ie pizza-cookie) desserts, which is a hot cookie baked in a pizza pan topped with ice cream.  So good!  But I was stuffed this time already from all the food.  Their portions are big btw so gotta plan accordingly next time to make it to the pizookie. Will definitely be back!  And judging by how busy this place was when we stopped by, people know already that it's good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=240,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

He would give me a beer my friend ordered. Even before we got our beers, it practically mission impossible.. Our server came back more than 3 times to refresh his memory on what we ordered, and still the beers came out incorrectly.  It basically took forever to get anything, and get anything right.

The service was great, we were greeted by a hostess as soon as we walked in the door and seated at a table within 5 min. Our waiter was very attentive, taking our order, refilling our drinks quickly etc The menu was large with a lot of good options, including a page of lighter entrees. I was only looking at desserts, we just stopped in for dessert and coffee before a movie, but all the food going to the tables around us looked delicious. We got pizookies that were amazing!! And it was very affordable, 2 coffees (with free refills) and 2 pizookies were only $11. The design/layout is really cool as well. They have their beer labels on the walls and cool artwork, the bar area is incredible with a huge TV. I liked that even though they had huge TVs the noise wasn't too much and I could still sit at a table and have a conversation.

217,Lucky D.,"Manassas, VA",0,95,28.0,3.0,2013-11-14,"Today I decided to venture out for lunch and try one of the new places in town.  Having heard about this brand from friends in the restaurant business and learning that is a successful competitor of CPK on the West Coast, I was curious. The place is vast and classy. The decor is retro-modern if that makes sense. Clean lines with modern finishes The ceilings are high, light fixtures large and fitting the immense space.  The host stand is unimpressive and subdued. Almost like an oversight by the design team. One large sunken dining room, easily to overlook from the bar area. As most modern creations, the kitchen is visible, separated by a wall of glass. The entire establishment is bathed in natural light, as both exterior walls are glass, allowing the sun to shine in.  I find that to be a rarity these days. Often windows are tightly covered with blinds, places so dark, one has to wonder if they don't want you to see what they are serving. As new as the place is, the regional manager still roaming the place, coaching and guiding the management team, the staff worked smoothly and calmly, instilling confidence in their service. I am impressed with how fast the place got up and running efficiently. Strangely enough, a manager did not visit to follow up on food or service.  The bar is large, in the corner of the restaurant. A few dozen different beers on tap. The variety interesting and plentiful for any beer lover.  Anyone familiar with Cheesecake Factory knows their extreme menu size. BJ's also believes more is better, offering a selection so large, it is overwhelming and difficult to navigate. One cannot be good at everything and today was a good example of that. Although the items very prepared quickly, memorable is not a word I would choose to describe them. The Corn Fritters looked appetizing but were nothing else but fried dough balls, similar to a hush-puppy. Four to an order, served on top of a sauce that is alike in appearance and flavor to a 1000 island dressing, sprinkled with real bacon bits.  Meatball pizza was prepared well and looked appetizing. Topped with chunks of ground beef, a far stretch from a meatball. Not what I expected, but perhaps the most flavorful of all dishes today. As far as pizza goes, it was a valid attempt to provide a quality product, but its just pizza. It only get so good. Parmesan Chicken, also well executed. Perfectly crusted and fried golden brown, looking just like the picture. Flavor fell flat, the entire dish was utterly bland.  I will probably stop in again, try something else on the menu and enjoy another one of their great selection of eclectic drafts. The atmosphere was pleasant enough to go back. Should the food not improve in flavor however, I will not return. In closing I'd say, try the place. Its a concept new to the area, the unknown and unfamiliar makes it exciting, but it's the food that gets you coming back, which at this point, I cannot recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=220,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

Tip: Go to the bottom level, you'll find plenty of spaces and beat the chaos. -Love the open concept. Nice decor inside. Spacious yet still inviting. *Cons* -Hopefully this won't be a con once they're fully open and in the swing of things, but man did they hover! We couldn't have a private conversation if our lived depended on it! -The server kept rearranging things on our table, flipping our menus, moving the salt and pepper shakers around, and this was happening while we were in the middle of dining. It was really odd. I think she has OCD. I may or may not have flipped the menu right back to the page I was previously on as soon as she walked away. Take that! -Mediocre food. I ordered the pepperoni lover's mini pizza, and man was it mini. It was small than the tostino's you used to get back in college. Sadly, it was pretty flavorless too. There was plenty of pepperoni, but it wasn't seasoned at all. The hubs had a bison burger, and it was super tiny. He like the fries alright though. -They make their sodas in house by hand, and when i asked the server to explain it to me- she had no clue what made them different from a regular ole Dr. Pepper (mmmm Dr. Pepper).

I had the sampler, and the only difference in the four was the color; otherwise they tasted pretty much the same. Sweet, bland and no hop flavor. These are beers brewed for the Bud crowd who think they're getting something unique. And there wasn't much of a selection of non-BJ's beers. My family was happy with their entrees, which looked good. But I had the ""deep dish"" pizza, and it was a huge disappointment. It was simply a regular pizza with a very thick, doughy crust. This is not Chicago-style pizza, this is carbo loading.

Taco Bell and a 40 from 7-11 would have been the more cost effective and satisfying choice. The staff was friendly enough and I liked our waiter, hence an extra star.  First off, I will preface by saying some consider me a beer snob. The 'Hopstorm IPA' arrived quickly and upon first sip and I immediately wrinkled my nose. There was an odd stale taste to it and I begrudgingly drank it.  Next came the Santa Fe egg rolls. While the portion was generous, I couldn't help but think I've gotten better from Safeway's frozen aisle. Nothing jumped out and the dipping sauces were meh at best. After that we were presented with the jambalaya. It was OK. A bit soupy and uninspired but otherwise edible.  Thinking perhaps the IPA was a fluke, I ordered the 'Tatonka stout'. It was one of the worst beers I've ever had and I'm a fan of Imperial Stouts. It was disgustingly sweet and again, some odd off-kilter malt flavor. I suffered through it and my palate is cursing me still as I type this.  On the plus side, the prices were reasonable and the portions were generous. I doubt I'd ever go there again however.

I'm a New Yorker and prefer a thin crust. I was willing to give it a try though because she had frequented the restaurant when living on the West Coast and was a fan.  Parking was underground and free with easy access to the restaurant and a reprieve from the wet and cold weather outdoors.  I was expecting beer and pizza but was pleasantly surprised that it offered much, much more. We were greeted by very friendly staff and our server was also friendly with a good sense of humor.  The space was wide open and covered from stem to stern with large screen HD televisions showing football games from DC and about a half dozen other cities.  Large windows provided a glimpse of the heavy snowflakes coming down in Fairfax. Outlets were conveniently located on the side of every other booth which made charging my cell phone's battery very efficient. The menu has something for everyone: soup, salad, burgers, pasta and pizza, including low-calorie and gluten free options.  I started with the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup on this cold, wintry, slushy weather day and was very pleased with the rich, creamy flavor. Highly recommended. L requested the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which despite its excellent presentation, was more brothy (less creamy) than expected. For the entrée, I had the half rack of Baby Back Ribs which was so tender that the meat fell off the bone easily. L's Parmesan Crusted Chicken in the Chardonnay butter sauce was crispy and well-flavored with a great sauce and good mashed potatoes.  For dessert, we shared the Pizookie. In the inimitable words of our beloved Cookie Monster: Coooooooookie!  Nuf said.

Bartender told me that on game days they turn up the sound on the main game.  Beer selection was outstanding: about 8 home brews, and another 20 or so outstanding commercial/national brands. If you're a beer drinker, you'll be happy with the selections. Bartender let me try 4 beers, of which I selected two. Both were excellent (Brewhouse Blonde and Piranha Pale Ale). I also had the fish tacos (Mahi Mahi) which were excellent. Came with a guacamole-like sauce and a tangy sauce, both of which were excellent. Service was outstanding.

It seems that the preparation of the chicken wings last time was a ""rookie mistake"" because our server told us that the chicken wings are supposed to be prepared with a light drizzle of ranch and buffalo sauce on the nicely fried exterior of the wings. I was definitely glad to hear that! The entrees seemed to fair much better as well. You're not going to get Michelin quality food, but you will get food that tastes good and is executed cleanly.  I hope BJs continues to improve, as the interior of the restaurant is stunning. It is a wonderful place to have a drink (Jeremiah Red), grab a bite, and watch a game.

First time I came with a few people to grab lunch. It was during happy hour so the pricier lagers were $4. My friend had a couple (Tatonka Stout and the Nutty Brewnette) and he said they were both incredible. I personally couldn't try them because I was under 21 at the time but in a few weeks I will definitely be popping in here to have one. The food during this visit was amazing. We had the Crispy Jalapeño Burger, the Grilled Burger Melt, and the California Burger and they were all cooked exactly how each of us wanted them. Our waiter saw to that. Excellent service.  That service was received the second time I went, this time with a very large party. When a couple extra guests showed up unexpectedly, I knew that it would be inconvenient and they would probably have to sit at a separate table. Our waiter was happy to add another table to our already large party. The food was magnificent then too. The atmosphere is very spacious, and familiar to other higher scale American restaurants like Sweetwater Tavern and Cheesecake Factory. Their sports bar is big and a focus point of the establishment.

One star for immediate seating which is infrequent in the Tyson's area. But now I know why. The other star is for the atmosphere. A nice bar area with a dining room with ample room in booth seating. Our server quickly walked by as my boss wanted to ask a question about the menu. She replied that she didn't have time. A few minutes later, she came back and asked for our drinks. I asked her a question on the lunch menu about the lunch salad and soup combo but she didn't know what was in the salads. I had to look through the menu for the other section that had the description. I ordered the tortilla soup (can you tell I love this soup?) and BBQ chicken chopped salad with the dressing on the side. The soup came out with chicken, tortilla chips, and avocado in the bowl and a separate pourer (looks like a creamer) that contained the broth with corn. The food runner poured the broth into the bowl before serving. I thought it was odd for a casual dining establishment. First bite/sip...cold!! Cold soup on a freezing day or any other day is definitely a no no! Okay moving on, maybe the salad will be better. The lunch portion salad had the dressing on it. I prefer to have my way on how much dressing which is why I ask for it on the side most of the time. The salad was okay...nothing spectacular- iceberg lettuce, few chicken chunks, avocado, tortilla chip shreds, corn, black beans, and tomatoes. My boss had the shrimp tacos- two sorry looking tacos on corn tortillas with a few tortilla chips on the side. The guacamole side looked like green mayo- where were the avocado chunks, onion, cilantro? Our server pretty much ignored us again when we asked for drink refills. She did come back to tell us about their club program. "" No thanks"" we said.

348,Jennifer Z.,"Centreville, VA",30,17,,2.0,2014-02-03,"I had been hoping to get a chance to try this place since I saw it open a few months back. It seemed like a competitive alternative to many of the places in and around Tyson's mall which I feel like I've made the rounds on time and again. Unfortunately, BJ's will not be making it's way onto any short list of places to go for food or drink.  The setup is promising: The interior and decor is very nice, with TVs mounted along the bar and an open floor plan that is very inviting as you walk in. Being new, it was remarkably clean, which I certainly appreciated. The menus are definitely worth noting, as the pictures of the food encourage you to salivate at the options. Sadly the pictures don't translate over to taste. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference in taste between an entree here or from Applebee's, except for maybe the price. I got the Bison Burger, which did not standout in any way. The meat was not very compact and had the consistency of a frozen Turkey patty. My date had a Chicken entree, which was thin, rubbery, and very bland. Again, I'd equate the entree to something frozen you could find at a grocery store. For drinks we got the 8 beer sample to try. I commend the variety, but there was nothing particularly alluring about the beers, and they certainly won't be enough to draw me back.  One thing that I would like to rave for a moment about was the service, which I would actually give 5 stars for. The waitress was engaging, the service was quick, and everyone there was very friendly. Overall, I'd say that you if you just wanted a nice, alternative atmosphere to watch a sporting event, this would be a welcoming spot.

Yes, we should have sent them back but we were all grumpy and just wanted to get dinner over with at this point.

I choose to have the sauce on the side just in case I didn't like it.  The Brewmommy sauce was tasty saltiness.  My friend didn't like it and thought that it had no character just salty.  I on the other hand love salt so I did enjoy it.  We asked what was in there and it is made with Dijon mustard, and BJ's secret spices.  I forgot the rest of it. :( The burger looked like it was hand made and it is served on a nice soft parmesan bun.  I liked the bun which was perfect for the burger not to overwhelm it.  It is served with grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.   The burger was yummy and I loved the crispy thin fries which was nicely seasoned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.572,3.1600000000000006

My simple Caesar salad took ages and when I got it, it consisted mostly of chunks of the core of some swanky iceberg lettuce. I had it sent back and my entree came before another salad did, and the server told me it'd be awhile for the salad. How does it take forever to compose a Caesar salad?! My wife's barbecue chicken salad was a far cry from the same dish as it's served at other BJ's locations. The whole thing was just off and didn't taste that great. I'm not sure what the problem is. BJ's, I love you and stand by you, but you need to have some more senior staff from California come out there and help tighten things up a bit.

I was sooo amazed at this fact.  I had many a dinner at the BJ's in Westwood Village during college and it has so much nostalgic value for me.  I had my 21st birthday dinner at BJ's several years ago and have visited countless times for their famed pizookies.  Even though I don't like beer, I've even tried their beer sampler.  BJ's is close to my heart and though the BJ's in Tysons Corner (McLean, VA) was not exactly the same as the Westwood one (and had quite a different layout, as it was flatter), it was still a great experience.  My boyfriend and I visited this past Monday, since I've been talking about wanting to visit this place ever since I found out it existed.  The Cali girl inside of me was so happy to try this place, even though we drove through snow to get here.  I ordered one of their famed pizzas - the Buffalo Chicken (individual sized), which came with diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in hot and spicy buffalo sauce, drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce.  The pizza was absolutely delicious and was a big enough portion that I had leftovers for the next day.  My bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed it. I also ordered a couple drinks - their Pomegranate Sunset (""Stoli Razberi Vodka | PAMA Pomegranate Liqueur | BJ's Fresh Squeezed Lemonade | Orange Juice | Monin Pomegranate"") and the BJ's Mojito (""BACARDI Limón Rum | BJ's Signature Mojito Mix | Muddled Fresh Mint | Club Soda"").  Both were excellent! My bf, per usual, ordered beer.  But BJ's, a microbrewery, is known for their beers, so I think he got the more authentic BJ's experience of the two of us. For dessert, my bf ordered the pizookie and LOVED it.  It's nice they have a mini-size option because we were stuffed at that point.  Unfortunately for the chocolate-hater that I am, I couldn't really have a pizookie (they only had chocolate options), so I opted for the equally-appealing BJ's baked beignet (bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream).

250,Lynda D.,"Alexandria, VA",0,23,,5.0,2014-03-24,"BJ's is one of our favorite restaurants/brew pubs in the USA!  When traveling out west, if it is in the vicinity of where we are, we seek them out knowing that the experience will be a good one.  We have been to their locations in El Paso, Texas, Reno, Nevada and Fresno, CA.  Their beers are great, their food is Cali style pub food (delicious, healthy and pairs well with their beers), the interiors are nice/upscale/comfortable/clean and the staff are usually friendly/professional/accomodating.  And, the quality of the place is consistent in each location (at least the ones that we have been to).  The new Tysons location meets all of these standards. When I found out that one had opened up here, I could not contain my excitement.  The initial exchange with my husband was pretty funny.  It went something like this...  I said excitedly ""Honey, a new BJ's opened up in Tysons Corners!""  He looked at me with a blank stare and said ""so what, there is a BJ's warehouse club here in Alexandria, why are you excited that another one just opened up in Tysons?""  I said, ""No - BJ's""  still no reaction... Then, I said, ""You know, BJ's Brewpub!""   Then, after a pause and a ""what?"", he understood and was just as happy as I was. We have been to the Tysons location a few times and like it very much.  Its location is easy to get to, it has convenient free parking in a covered lot shared with Nordstrom Rack and it is NOT in the mall. Only con is that it is not located closer to where we live.

Beer/booze (have you read some of my other reviews?): They not only have their own brews, which are offered at a great price for their happy hour specials, but they have multiple other beers and ciders on tap for those that aren't up to trying the house beers.  They also have a full bar to make cocktails or straight drinks. 2. Food: tasty pub fare.  I have yet to try their deep dish pizza, which looks quite tasty.  It's not gormet, but hits the spot when pared with beer.  The half size, reduced price happy hour apps are worth it too. 3. Space/service: this place doesn't look big, but offers a lot of space.  The bar gets pretty crowded during happy hour/Friday night, so you may need a table.  If so, the service isn't too bad.  They move as fast as they can, but could staff the bar with a little more since people are there to drink or watch what is one of the largest television screens I've seen up to this point in my life.

The bartender, Sam, who started our evening off was very friendly and attentive despite there being a full bar that Friday night. My group ordered a number of different appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, stuffed artichokes, flat bread pizza, buffalo deep dish pizza, and wings. Everything was delicious, but notably the crust on the deep dish pizza was flaky on the outside and the perfect softness on the inside.  The hand crafted beers were also good, I stuck to the Heffiweizen and had no complaints. Others ordered their different varieties and also enjoyed them as well.  The only thing which brought my experience down was at the end of Sam's shift, there was a bartender change and when I went to close my tab I told him my name and he handed me someone else's credit card. This was a bit scary, as that could've been my own card given away to some stranger. Also, when we were there, three  of our group wanted to sit at the tables to eat so as they were eating, 2 of us sat with them to keep them company (not for an extended period of time either, just to pop in and say hi). We were rudely approached by the waitress at their table who said ""order with me or order at the bar. if u order at the bar, u can't sit here."" It was said in a very distasteful manner, and it's not like my friends were NOT ordering food and drink from her and taking up table space for no reason.

This place located in Tysons Corner area (across from tyson 1, same building with nordstrom rack). We came here right before dinner, so the restaurant was packed. I love this place because there were a lot of TV to catch up on sports while you have dinner with your friends or love ones. The bar was crowded and all tables were also full. We got two people booth table and it was near the TV so I was happy with that.  The service was definitely above average for a busy friday night for them. The waiter for our table always come back to check on us and make sure we have enough attention from him. He made us feel welcome even though he was running around and helped the tables that weren't even for him. That is the kind of service needs recognition. The food quality was okay, I wouldn't say it is the best but its a little above average. I ordered pasta ( I believe) and the type of chicken I ordered ran out, so the manager for that night came out to apologized and ask if it was okay to substitute with something. I didn't mind any substitution.

We came back the next day and it was pretty quiet, so I assumed I just came at a bad time. Our waitress was very friendly and she was very knowledgeable about the beers. She said later that it was her first flight solo, which I wouldn't have guessed had she not told me.  We got to taste some beers. I don't like beer in general, but there were a few I actually enjoyed. I really liked the hand made sodas. I got to try the black cherry, orange, root beer and cream soda.  My kids ordered from the kids menu. It was fine. I will say that the kids burger was hand pressed which was good and she said the bun was really good. They put the lettuce, tomato and pickles on the side, which is nice, so that my kid didn't have to pick them off. If you want cheese, be sure to ask for it, because it came without. I got the thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which were really good and my husband got the fish and chips which he liked. The big winner here was the dessert. We tried 4 types of the pizookie, which is a deep dish cookie with a scoop of ice cream. The peanut butter was okay. It tasted like Subway's peanut butter cookie. The triple chocolate was fine. My kids and husband really liked that one. The chocolate chunk was good, but I really liked the salted caramel. It was a hot mess in the best way possible. It was chocolate chip cookie batter and had chocolate and white chips. There was caramel and pretzel chunks. Overall, it was a good experience.

261,Mike C.,"Fairfax, VA",2,1,,2.0,2014-06-17,"I went for the US World Cup game, which one could expect would be a busy night.  Well, the management didn't expect for it. First time visiting this place, and I was impressed with the size, the number of TVs, the beer selection and extensive menu.  I was, however, less-than-impressed with the service.  After waiting about 10 minutes while the distracted host/hostess eventually responded to the line at the desk to take names and hand out buzzers, I was told that a table for two would take 15 minutes (even though I saw 3 open).  I waited at the bar area to watch the game.  The bar was busy, but I only had to wait about 5-6 minutes to get a drink.  About 45 minutes later, my 15-minute table was ready.  (Ironically, one of the ones which I saw was empty when I walked in...). I sat down where the waiter (who seemed flustered and distracted all night) immediately told me that the bar and the kitchen were both backed up and I should order quickly.  I ordered a beer, and then didn't see him again for 7 minutes.  I ordered a water and a pizza at that time, hoping to get either before long.  The water took 5 minutes.  The pizza took about 40.  That original beer I ordered?  About 50 (even though the waiter told me three times that he went to find it and it didn't exist).  My friend showed up at that time, when it took him about 10 minutes to get a beer.  He put in a food order immediately to hopefully get served before the end of the match.  After finishing those beers, we ordered another (again, hopefully to arrive before the end of the match) and asked how long it would take for our food to be ready.  That's when the waiter, again flustered, swore to us and admitted to never putting in the order.   We finished those beers and left.  This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review like this. I thought the beer selection was good.  The ambiance was nice (although, loud inside even with no TV audio) and the food looked appetizing.  However, the lack of attention paid to the patrons by both the host staff and the wait staff was appalling.  I'm considering going back, when it won't be crowded, to see if it gets better.  If it doesn't, I'll update this post and reduce the rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=260,3.4,3.08,3.08,2.216,3.2080000000000006

A bunch of coworkers and I thought this would be a great place for us to go during lunch and after work. We thought wrong. Our first visit was AWFUL. The staff was inattentive, rude, forgetful, and honestly, non-existent. On top of that the food we had was disgusting. We vowed never to go back. I even wrote a complaint on the site and never heard back from anyone. Not even an ""I'm sorry you had such a bad experience."" Today, I tried again. i convinced a coworker to try it again with me, give it the benefit of the doubt, thinking perhaps they had really done some work and become much better since all this time had passed. I was wrong.  I will say, the waiter I had today was very good. That was the only good part about my experience. He was very attentive and helpful.  Sadly thought, this waiter isn't enough to make me go back ever again. The food was just terrible and over priced. How do you mess up a salad? I paid $10.00 for the BJ Cobb which was ALL lettuce. I REALLY wish I were exaggerating, I really do. Oh! Sorry, I forgot the 3 chunks of really disgusting processed turkey that I actually spit back out (something I have actually never done before, ever) and the extremely watered down dressing.  There is a reason why this place is EMPTY during prime Tyson's Corner Lunch hour....There are so many restaurants in the area where I can get excellent food and service for the same price, I have no intention to return to BJ's again.

It's a smooth and tasty drinking beer.  Their food is probably typical American fare. I split the bacon ranch deep-dish pizza with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. The salad was tasty, light and well balanced flavors. The pizza was pretty good, very filling but made perfect leftovers for lunch the next day.  What made me give BJ's 4 stars was the service.

We actually planned ahead before visiting and decided to take advantage of the ""Call Ahead Waiting"" advertised on their website. I called the restaurant, 703.356.7305, and followed the prompts. ""For Call Ahead Waiting for parties of 1-6 people, Press 2."" No problem, I was connected to (I assume) the front desk. After their perfunctory greeting, I informed them I was calling ahead to get on the waiting list. ""How many?"" she asked. ""Three."" This is where things took a turn.  ""Oh, I'm sorry. We can only do reservations for 6+."" No, no, I explained. I'm on my way and want to get on the waiting list. She told me in various ways that they don't do that for fewer than 6+ and they could not guarantee we'd get a table. I told her in various ways that I wasn't making reservations, but calling to get added to the wait list. It was Friday evening, so I assumed there was one. She could have told me there wasn't a wait, but instead it required serious effort to get her to grudgingly take my name and ask for an estimate of when we'd arrive. We arrived, were seated, and looked at our menus - at least after we were forced to specifically request a child's menu for our 3-year old. We ordered a a BJ's Hand-Tossed Pizza (BJ's Favorite w/Artichoke Hearts), a salad (Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad), and a child's meal (Grilled Chicken Pasta). The salad was disappointing, but not awful. The pizza, however, was just wrong. On the first try they delivered a pizza with the toppings sliding off one side - and it was missing the artichoke hearts. We sent it back. The second pizza had the required toppings and they weren't falling off the pizza, but the crust was hard. Not quite burned, but overcooked, without a discernible flavor, no texture other than hard, AND light on the toppings. If this had been our first pizza at BJ's, it would have been our last - and probably our last visit. (If you get the pizza, get the Signature Deep Dish. The Hand-Tossed is crap.) There were other little things, like our waiter never coming to refill our water (we were also drinking beer, but an empty water glass is an empty water glass) but nothing was nearly as disappointing as the food. Other visits have been better (not great, but better), but this one will take some time to recover from. Maybe we'll be back for a deep dish pizza. Maybe we'll be back for a burger.

There are good but unobtrusive TVs.  If you're looking for a good Happy Hour place, come here. However, I was here for dinner.  Nothing was wrong with the seating (a nice little table by the window near the bar -- they had lots of booths in the adjacent large area that also looked comfy). Nothing was wrong with the service.  But the food...ghastly! I ordered the corn fritters appetizer (four fritters for $3.95). Comes on a small sauce plate. Texture was ok, but pretty tasteless, even though there were tiny real bacon bits in the sauce. I tried the bowl of chili ($6.60).  This was a bowl with not a lot in it, volume-wise, or any otherwise. Completely liquid: apparently dishwater with a tiny bit of ketchup mixed in. No beans or chiles, just two or three microscopic pieces of ground beef that seemed to have accidentally fallen into the bowl. The dish was adorned with a teaspoon of sour cream. I ordered the California Burger ($11.25).  This is an avocado and green chili burger on sourdough with swiss. The hamburger had that awful mealy texture - cheap beef that has been cooked improperly.  I spit it out, it was so unbelievably gross. I ate the tiny slices of avocado on the bread (which was soggy) as my entree. If I had gone to McDonalds I would have gotten a MUCH better burger. If I opened a can of Hormel chili, that would have been MUCH better. The food here is a bad joke. Easily the worst meal I've (tried) to eat in years. I would have sent it back, but I got the overall definite impression that this was really the best they could do.

Decided to come back because of those previous visits.  Sadly this visit wasn't as pleasing as the last. Having experience in the restaurant business you always know that the seat by the bathroom or kitchen door is the last spot a host would put a party if you had other seats in the section available. We were seated next to the bathroom/kitchen door AND next to where all the servers were socializing and folding napkins and forks. Not to mention the fact that host and server were not very friendly. As soon as they finished taking down orders they just plopped to the table beside us to continue socializing. We could hear every single word. And of course our food came out wrong.

Then we ordered and our food arrived before our water did which was very strange. One of my co-workers ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich which came out in about 2 minutes. The waiter said the sandwich was already made for another table and was made incorrectly. It felt very awkward.  Our waiter acted very much like he didnt care much about the quality of food or service. The manager came to out table 4 different times and was apologetic each time but did nothing to fix anything. She just kept saying she was sorry but didnt make any efforts to correct any wrong-doings. We ordered dessert with 20 minutes left before we had to leave to get back to work. The dessert took 20 minutes to come out and we asked for it to go because we were going to be late. They brought it out on a plate like normal. We then asked for them to just bring the check which took at least 10 minutes. The manager then said she wanted to make things better and to wait. We said we didnt have time too but she asked us too. So we sat and she went away and after a few minutes she brought us coupons for free dessert which we indicated we didnt want.  Such a terrible experience all around.

Then our waitress broke off the cork in our bottle of wine which caused a 20-minute delay and brought us sweetened iced teas instead of the unsweetened ones we requested.

I came here with some friends, 5 to be exact, to watch Monday Night Football. It was relatively busy but nothing that should warrant the staff to be overwhelmed by any means. We all sat at the bar and did all of our ordering from there. Things started out fine, we got our initial beers/drinks and started to settle in. By the time we wanted to get our 2nd rounds, the server was no where in sight for at least 10 minutes. OK. No biggie. He finally comes back around and we get our orders in. The drinks came one at a time, slowly, in fact one of them never even got his drink. We decided to move to the other side of the bar in hopes that we would be more visible. His son was there and he ordered food, it arrived and he said he tasted great, some pasta and chicken dish. The rest of us ordered wings and the particular flavor we ordered was not what we got, so the kitchen mixed up, not a big deal, we still ate it, this flavor was mediocre at best. Another friend proceeded to celebrate our evening by ordered us all a round of shots, he ordered them from what appeared to be the bar manager (not sure to be honest), 40 minutes later they never arrived. At this point I was fed up. Too many little things end up becoming a big thing when you add it all up. When we brought all of this to what I believed to be the bar manager's attention, she brought us out the incorrectly ordered wings as we are ready to leave and then provided us with a complementary birthday dessert (FYI: it was also a birthday for one of us) and when we asked for additional spoons, they never came either. Really? Although they tried to make up for the multiple mis-steps that accumulated along the way, it was too little too late. I will NEVER go back. I can't speak for my friends, but I am fairly certain they agree with my sentiment. Service needs to be done right the first time around, playing make-up after the fact is a path down a dark road. We ended up leaving before the first game ended and went across the street to what became a much better experience... read my review of Paladar if you want. On a side note, the bar manager insisted that they were the best place to watch football in the general vicinity, as if there wasn't another bar within spitting distance. Oh how wrong you were. About the 2nd star. The dessert was pretty damn delicious. I really wish their chef and pastry chef leave BJ's and join a more customer service conscience restaurant really soon, when you do let me know so I can stop by and say hi.

While the food is decent, the service we had for ten people at lunch today was terrible., even though we gave the restaurant a week's notice that we were coming. I had planned for an enjoyable afternoon to celebrate the milestones of three of my colleagues, but having lunch here and having to put up with the terrible service put a damper on everyone's afternoon. By the end, everyone at the table was complaining and I was embarrassed and apologetic to them for making the reservation and wasting their time. We had to plead with the wait staff to take the drink orders at our table. Then it took forever for the drinks to come and we gave up asking for refills. One of the managers did give us waters and refills after we complained. She said one of her servers had an accident and they were short staffed and unprepared for the Friday lunch crowd. Not a good reason to me given the size of the restaurant. Good service should not be based on the absence of one server.  Our meals finally came out 1.5 hours later, and not all at the same time.  My meal never came until I complained. When it did come, they forgot the side salad I requested. Same w another coworker. We were forced to eat our colleagues' fries while we waited. Another co worker never got his appetizer but gave up asking. It took even more time to get our checks.  By the end of the meal, we had spent 2.5 hours at the place, time we don't have to waste when we are all trying to get back to work.  BJs did give myself and a coworker of mine our meal for free, and took ten percent everyone else's order, but the damage was done. We never did get a decent apology. An afternoon of celebration turned into one of frustration, anger, and disappointment for all.  BJs needs to hire more staff and better train them if it wants to stay open. All of agreed to never recommend it to others. I meant to plan an afternoon to boost morale, but the service here killed it.

Not Chicago but still awesome.   What really turned me off from the place was the service. It was mediocre at best. Firstly, we were seated immediately which was nice. The hostess who seated us was very friendly. We had a nice two person booth. Would have liked a bigger booth but we didn't mind.  Then it basically went downhill from there. It was almost 15 minutes before anyone even came by for our orders. After waiting for almost 15 minutes, one guy comes along, tells us our server will be along in a bit and takes our drink orders. I get a beer and my friend gets some goofy mocktail. The drinks never come though. It's almost 10 minutes later when our server comes along to take the food order.  We order the pizza and tell her we already ordered our drinks. She tells us the guy forgot what we ordered but she can take it again. My thought at this point is if he forgot, why didn't he come back and ask again.   Anyway, food comes out really fast. Either it was already prepared or some magic happened. But it was good. No complaints in the food. Halfway through the meal, our server comes back to ask if we're doing alright. We ask for a coke and a water. That never comes.

The menu gave us a ton of choices and I really wanted everything on the menu. Our server read my mind as I asked him what his favorite app and entree were, and he said the exact same things I was thinking of getting: The Frito Nachos and the Jalapeno Burger!  The beer list gave a good range and the beer was actually very good. Drinks and apps came out really quickly, which is good since our 2:00 pm reservation had me starving by the time we got there. For apps, we ordered the highly recommended Frito Nachos, Carnitas Fries and the Fried Calamari. The apps itself were a little under portioned (or maybe I was just starving), but they were good. Not great, but I was very pleased. Now here are the bad parts. By the time we finished our appetizers and first round of beers, we noticed that our waiter went missing. Also, he never took our orders for our entrees!!! It's quite noticeable if a table of 16 has their heads popping up, looking around for our waiter. I think someone mentioned something as he came rushing out to take our order.  I got the Jalapeno Burger. I love cheeseburgers, but it's not often I can get one that is flame grilled. I was stoked, but knew to get it Rare as most of the juices in a flame grilled burger actually fall off into the grill. This doesn't happen when you cook on a flat top, but then again, you don't get that flame grilled taste. We had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food since our orders were taken well after we finished our appetizers. Not a great way to manage our hunger! All the food came out at once...except for my cousin's pizza, which arrived 5-10 minutes later (smh). Excitedly cut my burger in half to devour it and automatically noticed it was well done. I ordered rare and it came out well done. It was dry, not juicy. But I was so hungry that I didn't care. The burger was ok. I've had better at Burger King. I'm sure it would have been better if it was cooked the way I wanted to. But for the waiter to suggest this is the best item on the menu is a great disappointment. My other cousin ordered the Top Sirloin. That was also well done. Tough and hard as a brick. She sent it back, but had to wait another 10-15 minutes for her new steak to come out.  I left after 2 hours, most of it was waiting, and the food was just mediocre at best. The rest of the party stayed for desserts. Please save your time and money and go somewhere else.

It was sat lunch time and they were loud and literally screaming at the TV(game) none of the managers or supervisors did anything about it. It was obvious other guests were disturbed because everyone would look at them. The manager should have politely told them to turn it down a bit. The waiter was def creepy but besides that he asked how everything was , I replied not great but were done so he said ok I'll be back with your check?  I asked for the manager to explain to her the situation and told her we are not looking for free food but just wanted her know the situation. She handled it very well and professional and offered courtesy cards to come back.  We will not be back...and after we left I looked at the menu again to see an ingredient I wasn't sure about in my salad, to my surprise I noticed I never got the chicken in the chicken salad... So we paid for a meal that we didn't even get...

I had the following: Drink: 8 beer tasters - My favorite is Jeremy Red Appetizer: Garlic parmesan wings - decent but I can't eat more than 2 of these... Salad: BBQ chicken chopped salad - awesome as always! My cousin had the Sante Fe salad which is almost just as good. Pizza: Deep-dish 1/2 BJ's Favorite & 1/2 Spicy Hawaiian - soooo good! The bread is so sticky and chewy. I love the fact that these pizzas are individually baked fresh with each order.  Usually, I would have a pizooki to finish the meal, but I was way too full this time around to get one. Had I gotten a pizooki, I would've gotten 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 oatmeal (assuming they still do 1/2s like they used to back in the days).

96,Dawn C.,"Reston, VA",53,56,,2.0,2015-04-14,"First of all, the extra star is for pretty good gluten-free pizza with a wide range of toppings to choose from. So I'd say if you want a beer and a GF pizza after work and don't care about atmosphere or any of the other critiques in this review, this is your place to go. HOWEVER, everything else about this place is so one star it's silly. If this was out in Ashburn, I could maybe forgive most of the flaws, but this is prime real estate in Tyson's Corner! I went for a happy hour, arrived just a little after 5pm. The bar was PACKED. The high ceilings and large space means it's LOUD (just FYI, I know there's not much they can do about that). There were about half as many servers doing happy hour as they needed, and they were all extremely surly. As in come over, grumble ""What do you want to drink?"" and then get pissy when the members of my party who had literally just walked up didn't immediately know what they wanted. I had a server get pissy at me because I asked for a water refill, from the pitcher that was right next to her, that I was going to get myself but then decided I should ask first. There were multiple pissed off servers acting like it was *so insanely inconvenient* that they had to walk through people standing around and talking... at happy hour... in a bar. ALSO, if you're going to go here for a happy hour, ONLY GO IF YOU TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING WITH. Their ticket system prints everything for a party up on one big huge ticket so it would be exceptionally easy for someone in your party to slip out without paying, leaving you footing the bill. The drinks are a total and complete joke, unless you like Bacardi and flavored Stoli. Reminds me of the stuff we used to drink in college when we wanted to feel high-class. Just bottom of the barrel, cheap cheap stuff.  This place is trying to be a high-class Applebee's, and doing a piss poor job of it. There's about a hundred other, better service better quality better food choices in Tyson's Corner to go to for happy hour.

I ordered the BJ's Favorite mini even though the crust was perfect, the toppings seemed to have just been sprinkled on top and did not get baked in with the cheese. The BF ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and both of our pizza were a bit dry due to lack of sauce. We might need to ask for extra sauce next time!

271,Stephanie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",7,1,,1.0,2015-06-03,"I don't usually write reviews, but this particular dining experience was an exception. I have been going to BJ's for years and have eaten at many BJs restaurants back in California. It's one of my favorite places to go for pizza, pizookies and a good time. When I heard that a BJ's Restaurant was opening in the Virginia area, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, this particular BJs has left me disappointed with the service and the quality of the food several times, and after my most recent visit, I will not be returning. My friends and I walked into BJs on a Saturday afternoon ready to watch the NCAA playoffs, eat a good meal and just have a good time. There was no wait, but we initially sat ourselves in the self-seating area. After a few minutes, we decided that it did not offer a good view of the TV screens, so we asked to be moved to the main seating area. A waitress escorted us to an empty booth in the main restaurant and said she would get our server. We asked her if it was okay that we sit there, and she said that she had spoken to the hostess who said it was fine. Two minutes later, our new server shows up and basically scolds us for ""seating ourselves in what is clearly not a self-serve area."" Not only does he scold us, he proceeds to lecture us about how restaurants work and that you need to check in with the hostess and wait to be seated. We tried explaining the situation to him, but he would not listen. He proceeded to give us attitude saying that he had been saving this particular table plus one other for his friends. We immediately offered to move to another table, but instead he told us to stay and that he would ""let it slide,"" although he was very visibly angry and even mentioned that he was ""upset with the other server for seating us there."" My friends and I had never felt so uncomfortable or unwanted at a restaurant before. After staying for 15 minutes and ordering a pitcher of beer, we decided to get the check and just leave. On our way out, we briefly mentioned the incident to the restaurant manager who casually apologized, but seemed completely unconcerned with what his server had done. I have never seen such unprofessional behavior or received such poor service at a restaurant, or anywhere for that matter, before.

82,Matt G.,"Brick Township, NJ",66,258,3.0,3.0,2015-06-10,"As Yelp describes three stars, this place falls squarely into the ""A-OK"" territory.  Not bad, not great, but an OK option to eat at if you're in the area. The atmosphere here is your fairly standard sports bar, with a *very* slight bistro / pub touch.  There's a brewery on premises that churns out a fairly decent selection of brews (more on that later) for you to imbibe, and prices are fairly average for the area.  A few friends local to the area told me that BJ's specialty is pizza, although being from New Jersey, I knew that was a tree I didn't want to go barking up, so I opted for a burger, extra rare. First things first - the service is what really knocks points off, here.  It took *forever* to get anything, be it refills on drinks, more beers, or even salads.  One friend ordered a pizza with olives, and was told nearly 35 minutes later that the kitchen was out, and they could make him something else.  Really? You waited until most of our food was out of the kitchen before telling us this?  The poor guy had to sit there watching us all eat, until his own food finally came out. What should have been a quick meal of pizzas, burgers and beers (not the most complex things, folks), ended up taking ~2 hours, when all was said and done.  My burger was more medium-well than rare, which I figured would happen, since it took so long to exit the kitchen.  The beers were pretty decent, although nothing really stunning.  Still, they redeem themselves a bit in that department, since there was plenty of styles to pick from. Would I go back?  Eh, maybe.  The food wasn't bad, and the beers are a nice addition, but slow service and poor communication kind of soured the whole experience.  With so many options in the area, including several other breweries / brewpubs, I'll probably end up elsewhere if I'm down in the area.  Still, an OK option if you're in a pinch, and want a menu that will have something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=120,3.0,2.86,2.86,3.2120000000000006,2.9160000000000004

She also knew the menu well and was patient with our table when we couldn't decide what to get. There is a lot of options for drinks and food, which of course forced me to take wayy longer than necessary to choose. It is in a great location right next to Nordstrom Rack (for all the shopoholics to go to post a great meal) and near Tyson's Corner. We had calamari for the appetizer and it was average - nothing special about it. I ordered the fried chicken which was really good. I love their mashed potatoes and gravy. The fried chicken was perfect although I do wish there was more chicken for it...even though I had to bring home leftovers. It was extremely crispy and tasted so good. My brother in law ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I have had before and that is pretty good too. My sister ordered the burger which she claims is top burgers she has had.  Of course, we had to order pizookies at the end. We decided on the white chocolate macadamia and the cookies and cream. Both were so good and come with ice cream on top. This place is a must try.

BJ's Brews (Jeremiah red is my boyfriend's favorite) 3. BJ's Pizookies (variety of warm, gooey cookie skillets with ice cream - TRY IT) Majority of the menu is however is mediocre. Menu is too big for them to really focus on making the food spectacular (similar to Cheesecake factory). But at least you have A LOT of CHOICES.  Our favorite deep dish pizza is the Pepperoni EXTREME... peps 3 ways... sliced, diced and julienned. Buffalo chicken pizza is delish as well. They'll also let you order half one pizza and half another which is perfect for when you can't decide! We always sit at the bar area & enjoy some brews with our pizza. Lots of TVs for football in fall (& beer specials for GOOD QUALITY BEER!) We've been lucky to have very attentive service every visit.  For a while we parked in the nearby parking garage around the corner making it a cold walk in the winter.  After eating at BJ's like 10 times, we JUST figured out about the convenient & free parking garage underneath the restaurant (we felt like idiots!).

I ordered the Jeremiah Red and my date ordered the Piranah Pale Ale. We were both impressed with the flavors of our beers. Very impressed. We also ordered mojitos. She ordered the strawberry and I ordered the regular. Again, the work at the bar was impressive. Very good drinks that were very well made. For the appetizer, we ordered the calamari. We love the fact that both rings and regular fried squid were served. The ring were cooked perfectly, the squid, however, were way over-cooked.  For the entrees, my date ordered the Chicken Barbacos and I ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli. First, I made the mistake of not ordering what my date ordered. That was the best low-calorie chiken I have ever eaten. My second mistake was ordering a good ravioli. The quantity in the deep dish really required me to consider how in the hell I was getting back to the hotel without requiring a crane.  The sauce was a.little too sweet for me, and that is saying a lot. For dessert, we ordered the strawberry bingnet.  My date is more of a chicolate fan, but did enjoy this sinful little dessert.

We all ordered from the lunch special menu (because honestly, why not), and the food was pretty good. I got a Piranha Brew Chili and Cheese potato which was around $10, and it tasted fairly good. It was by no means disappointing, rather just standard American baked potato. Nothing too special. My other friends overwhelmingly got chicken tenders and fries, and they were also good. Between all of us, we shared a couple pitchers of BJ's Berry Burst Cider, and it was quite tasty. It was predominately flavored with blackberry/raspberry/wildberry so it was a bit tart but just the right amount of sweet. I am a sucker for cider however, so maybe that's just me, but all my other friends quite enjoyed it as well. One of us got a burger with fries (forgot what kind) and man, his dish looked -colossal-. Maybe it was the size of the burger or the sheer amount of fries he received with his dish, but he ended up having to get a to-go box. We ran into a slight hiccup with our check because of the pitcher split between us and some wrong change given for cash orders, but it was otherwise resolved fairly quickly and they didn't give us too much grief over it. Other places might have been a little difficult depending on the service, but we got it done pretty quickly.

I really wish the experience had gone better and I could update this review with more stars but that is not how the event went.  We were seated at 1914 next to a long table full of 10-13 year old boys, probably the loudest part of the restaurant. There seemed to be other two seater tables that were available and I should have asked to be seated somewhere else but there seemed to be no recognition by the staff of seating couples away from the commotion that boys that age naturally engage create. One of the parents even came over from the other side of the kids table and said half jokingly that we could yell at them when they got too loud. They did get too loud but we did not yell.  The reception by the person at the front desk and the person that seated us was close to indifference.  It was 5 minutes before Emily stopped by our table to tell us she would be with us soon. She returned 3 minutes later and took our order. We got our drinks at 1925. My ice tea glass spent a lot of time empty and a second glass was brought at 1944 but I ate most of the meal with no drink. Our food arrived at 1941. We had the sliders and wedge fries. We both liked the fries and the sliders were okay.  Our server, Emily, was pleasant.  There was no clearing of glasses or dishes throughout the meal. My first empty ice glass stayed on the table for the entire meal. I had a clear view of 4 other tables and saw the same pattern.

156,Ron M.,"Annandale, VA",0,56,7.0,4.0,2016-01-12,"Went with wifey for a deep dish pizza and a full rack of ribs for lunch. No wait. The prices are a little higher than the average restaurant of its kind, but probably in line with the area (Tysons).  The food itself was good. The pizza was excellent according to my wife - flavorful, and the crust / pesto ingredient combo was crispy on the outside and moist/soft on the inside. The olives and pesto were really good ingredients and she really loved it. The tough part is that for a 14"" deep dish it was $25, which is pretty pricey. I don't know that it's worth a $10 premium over what a comparable pizza would cost at Pizza Hut, though my wife was pretty convinced that the ingredients were better quality. I had the rack of ribs, with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. The sides were just okay. The potatoes weren't lumpy but a bit dry. The brussel sprouts seemed to be a meager amount at first, but when I lifted up the rack about half of the sprouts were underneath. The sprouts themselves had a little balsamic on them; they were roasted and weren't bad, but not great. The ribs themselves were pretty tender; the bone would get pulled out with a gentle pull. They weren't falling apart tender, but the tradeoff was that the glaze had made a lovely crust that was quite delicious. Restaurant seems relatively new and in very good condition. Lots of large TVs everywhere, though you can't necessarily hear them. Very large open spacious area with clear sight lines to many TVs. Bathroom was clean and well kept. I tend to like bathrooms where I can exit without touching anything; here, they have a Dyson airblade and paper towels but the trashcan isn't near the door, so you may have to touch the door to exit. Justin W. was our server. He was excellent - having been to a lot of local competitors like Coastal Flats, Founding Farmers, and Chef Geoff's, his service was better than all of them, including our happy hour favorite, Chef Geoff's.

We came here to watch a football game and have some good deep dish pizza. It took several minutes to locate our server. When he finally arrived, he has zero energy. Seriously, if you don't want to work there, you really shouldn't or they should pay you better. We ordered apps which came out very late and ordered 2 pizzas. The pizzas came out underdone and had to be sent back. The server told us 10 min. 40 min later, two new pizzas which weren't as we asked and still underdone. We were in all seriousness the only people eating food at this point as they were empty so the question arises as to why such a delay? The manager came out to explain there was only 1 chef and he got backed up. But with who?? Nobody else is dining in your facility except for a handful of people eating fries at the bar. We couldn't find our server again and had to get another gentleman to help us. Our waiter came to us and said, ""I'm just the waiter, not the cook"". Uh...ok.  We looked up your reviews and it's pretty much a generalized opinion that there are major flaws at this location. It's a shame though.

A co-worker and I came to this establishment for the first time. We wanted to drink custom brewed beer and bourbon and were greeted with a less than interested bar staff. Maybe we should have sat at a table - maybe we should have known our place - but this particular day we were just in need of a couple of happy hour beers and appetizers and somehow this was a difficult task. First - it was our first time at BJ's and the bar staff was less than accommodating to acknowledge this. It was before 5:30p with a bar half full but still me and my colleague were forced to wait. When we did order food - we sat for almost an hour and our bartender never acknowledged our wait or even asked if we were in need of assistance. Our first beer is empty- and we still wait. We chose to request service from another bartender to request our second drink and to see if our appetizers were coming. 5 tables arrived after us and received food and we still waited - no bartender inquired to our needs. I asked bar staff, wait staff, and servers to look into our food - NO RESPONSE. I then cancelled my order as this is a happy hour not dinner - and dinner time is fast approaching. My colleague and I finished our drinks and proceeded to cash out. I placed my credit card - she was waiting to finish hers to place hers. Without warning the bartender swiped my card for the entire balance - no one stated ""are you ready"" or ""you all set"" as I saw others at the bar were acknowledged. No biggie - 4 drinks - I will take it. All I have to say is - I deserve to be acknowledged and to be respected and to be served. Today, I cannot say I was any of these things. Some may have received amazing service but today my colleague and I did not. I noted on my bill that ""I will never come here again EVER!"" These words I mean and I will stay true to. I was a server in college and am fully aware of good service - this was the worst service I have received in my entire LIFE. Maybe I was not the customer they wanted but I know I would be the best they ever had.

The shrimp entree was fine and had good flavor but came with the most pathetic Caesar salad -- limp lettuce and two croutons. To top it all off the machine for credit cards was broken that day and made it difficult to pay, for which the waitress was not apologetic for.

I look forward to trying other food at this restaurant. Service was fantastic.  Even though there were about 20 of us, she took care of everything promptly, but also did bother us too many times and just let us sit and enjoy during our meeting time.

Met a friend here the other night. They got here first and sat. I arrived 10 minutes later. I got to the table and started to talk to my friend and it seemed like a while passed by without even a hint of a server coming to us once.. My friend saw the confused look on my face and she said yeah, been sitting here 30 minutes and not one person has come to our table. Not to say hello, not to say be right back, not to even offer us a glass of water... I got up to talk to the people at the host station and when I said we have been sitting for 20-30 minute and one one person has come to our table. In a snotty attitude the host pointed behind me and said well the server is there now..  I got back to the table, we ordered drink and soon after drinks came. We talked that it stunk it took so long for the waiter to come to us but now that he came, hopefully the rest of the night will be fine.  The server came back with our drinks and at that point we were ready to order and ordered our food. It took about an average amount of time for our food to come to us, We started to eat our dinner and ran out of drinks. We watched for 10 minutes our server helping other tables and not coming to us. Finally I raised my hand and got his attention and asked for mor drinks and i.e. said sure...  I am not joking when I say this.. 20. yes T W E N T Y minutes passed, No drinks. We tried to get the attention of any server to see if we could have our drinks, one bartender who we got his attention, signaled like he would help us but nope.... Waited and waited and waited some more. Finally the waiter looked in our direction and we asked him for our drinks were ordered 20 minutes ago. And with us not having anything to drink. We sat there looking at our food, not wanting to eat without a drink. So guess what, by the time we got some more to drink, our food was cold.. But with the slow service we had, if we would have complained it would have been easter before we got any acknowledgement of our issues. When there server came back with our drinks, my daughter who was with us wanted a desert and I made sure I ordered it then because I know wit would be 20-30 minutes before we got his attention again. He would come to other tables he was serving, talk to them, help them, then walk away, He would go back in the kitchen and stay back there for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Hello. If your eating for something to be prepared, instead of lolly gaggling in the kitchen how about you go to your other tables and help them.  The waiter seemed like a nice person.  I blame the problem on this...  MANAGEMENT. or shall I say MIS-MANAGMENT!!!!! Managers should be walking around the restaurant and checking in on customer, see how things are and if we needed anything.

It's truly a party in your mouth! Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If comfort food's your thing, it's worth mentioning that this place has 5 different grilled cheese sammies. I love the bacon, avocado and havarti version and it pairs well with the chili! Yumm-o and fantastic when rain or snow come to town.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,2.36,2.98,2.964,2.612,2.732

On May 15, 2016, for the third time, we brought a large group of guests to BJs to try and have an enjoyable celebration for my fiancee's graduation. At some point during the meal, a server spilled iced tea on my future-mother-in-law's cocktail dress, drenching her; the rest of the meal was not enjoyable as a result, and she did not bring a change of clothes, and was forced to fly back to Boston, still soaked. I get it, it happens. I don't hold anything against the server. It was an innocent mistake, but how BJs has chosen to resolve it - or not - is what really grinds my gears. The restaurant referred us to their ""Risk Management"" team in California to get the dry cleaning paid for - ""Michelle Hayden"" was assigned to our case. Ms. Hayden proceeded to ask for pedantic documentation, including a copy of the dry cleaning bill, some arbitrary forms BJs invented to make fixing this issue a pain in the rear, and a legal release form that only an attorney could understand. Ultimately, the dry cleaning did NOT remove the stain, so we've asked for replacement value for the dress. It's just a $50 dress from TJMaxx, not a big deal. It is to BJs, though! They still refuse to accept responsibility and demand pictures of the stain not coming out (the dry cleaner through the dress away at our request) and the original receipt from when the dress was purchased (years ago). It's looking like this matter will end up having to go to Fairfax Small Claims Court because BJs simply does not want to own up to their mistake and make us whole. We're talking about $65 here, which is one dinner check, and they're attempting to make us go through all these unnecessary hoops and requiring excessive documentation to get it - their goal is probably to frustrate the crap out of us enough to never have to pay up! Very unethical and disappointing. It's not like we're claiming a Vera Wang dress and asking for $1,000 in reimbursement. Because of their total lack of business ethics, we will not be back.

It took them almost 30-35 minutes to bring entrees, which made us even more annoyed! Then when the entrees came out, my order was wrong. I told him a small pizza, they bring out a mini. So now I'm waiting another 15 minutes for a damn pizza. My fiance and mom got the brisket and bacon burger and both burgers come out extra well done with extra charcoal on the bottom, it was burnt! It was hard to even eat with the bacon on it because the smell and flavor of the burnt patty was so strong. I told my fiance to send it back but he knew it would have taken another 20 minutes and he was already hangry (hungry and angry). When I asked for a refill, it took our server another 10 mins for my sweet tea to come out, which I'm sitting there with no drink for 10 minutes.  Overall, the whole experience was an absolute disappointment. Was there only 1 chef in the back?? It really takes 30 mins to make 2 burgers, meatballs and spaghetti and chicken pizza?? Either there was only 1 chef or all of those cooks were slow. Might I add the restaurant wasn't even busy, only the bar area was but not dining area. I honestly could not believe we paid $100 for this disappointing food and crappy service. Angelo only had a few tables maybe 3-4 because there were a few other waiters there. If you can't handle a few tables, then the restaurant business isn't for you. BJ's need to teach their employees better customer service and how to not be on your phone for 10 minutes when you have guests waiting. And maybe the cooks need to learn how to cook correctly and NOT burn the food before serving customers. Just get a George Foreman grill if you don't know how to cook a patty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,2.32,2.97,2.92,2.212,2.71

For my entree I got the New Orleans Jambalaya, which I would say was fair, and not extraordinary.  I would say that what made it not so appealing was that the dish was far too salty, as I was chugging water to compensate.  I wish there was more of a cajun taste to dish instead of pure sodium.  The dessert was the highlight of the mean as I got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie.  Man, I love me some cookies and ice cream and this dessert was exactly what I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth.  You get a nice warm cookie topped with a scoop of chocolate Ice cream, and on top of it, you get a nice drizzle and I think extra chocolate chips.  Great dessert, but I want to try all of the pizookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,2.44,2.98,2.928,2.6399999999999997,2.7640000000000002

Here are my recommendations on what's worth ordering and what to skip. - Cocktails: SKIP. Alabama cocktail and Whiskey Sour were a bit too sugary. Don't expect to get artisanal cocktails.  - BJ's Berry Cider - Worth it. On the sweet side, but enjoyed the cider and brewed in-house. - Crispy brussel sprouts - Worth it. Nice and crispy, but not greasy.  - Avocado egg rolls - SKIP.  Not my favorite, too many avocados were stuffed inside. - Mini Deep Dish Pizza - SKIP.  Just not that tasty, a notch below Pizza Hut. - Pizookies - Worth it. BEST part of the meal, you can't go wrong with any of the flavors, they even do 1/2 and 1/2. My favorite are chocolate chunk, followed by triple chocolate, and monkey bread.  Non-Happy Hour Food Worth Ordering - Turmeric Roasted Cauliflower: Great flavor with lentils, nuts, and spices. - Salads: Salads at a sports bar? They are surprisingly quite tasty. I got a summer brussel sprouts salad with blueberries, nuts, and goat cheese. Overall, I recommend doing a blend of happy hour and non-happy items to get the most value from your meal. Next time I come here, I know exactly what I'll get it: BJ's Berry Cider, brussel sprouts, Turmeric Roasted Cauliflowe, and a salad (to make up for the rest of the meal), and of course PIZOOKIE.

33,Allie J.,"Fairfax, VA",79,43,71.0,2.0,2017-08-13,"My fiancé and I went here for dinner before going to a concert at Wolf Trap. I had only been to a BJ's brew house once before, and that was for a soft opening so they had a limited amount of choices.  When we walked in, there were three people at the hostess stand, and when I told them we had a party of two, they stared at us for a solid 10 seconds before acknowledging us or before they started to walk us to a table. It was as if we were being an inconvenience by deciding to dine there.  Our waitress dropped off our menus, took our drink order then came back, ""you ready to order yet??"". She didn't ask if we had any questions about the text book sized menu, didn't explain any happy hour specials, and when I said I was going to look at the drink menu, she didn't follow up with asking if I wanted a beer/cocktail.  We didn't see her again until our food came; I had a club sandwich and my fiancé had baked ziti. The food was served warm and delicious! Their French fries are the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Our waitress was nowhere to be found throughout our meal, a woman who was obviously dressed as the manager walked by our table several times and saw our empty glasses, but never came over to offer a refill. After finishing our meal and waiting for the waitress to come back, she didn't ask how our food was but rather said ""ready for the check?"".   At this point I was ready to just pay and leave, but we decided to have one of their famous pizookies. We got half salted caramel and half cookies and cream. Holy cookie deliciousness! Our waitress dropped off the dessert as well as the check. When we finished, she came over and paid our check at the table (one of my favorite features of BJ's; you see the transaction and your card never leaves your table). In the time she paid our check, the waitress didn't speak a single syllable. Then she walked away; no ""enjoy your evening"", no ""we hope you come back"", nothing.  Unfortunately, I had to lower my rating due to their poor customer service, but the food was very good! I plan to visit other BJ's brewhouses in hopes of more friendly employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2?start=20,2.68,2.73,2.928,,2.71

Though, I've heard the Mediterranean pita tacos are good from family and friends. It's a decent price and is convenient since it's right near Tysons Corner mall.

American style pub, variety of eats and drinks, classic rock/cool tunes. Still a cool gig, perhaps lacking a bit of originality is all. Parking in the underground garage with an elevator that has a BJs button. Much appreciated for the parking tards, like myself.  They have a nice selection of wines actually, not just a standard KJ Chardonnay. Don't normally see Hess Select on the list so that was nice. Generous pours. I ended up getting the tuna poke app, which had a lot of abundant, fresh sushi-grade tuna. Overall, lots of working folk here, business lunches, happy hours. Kind of the standard gig over in Tysons.

2,Melissa M.,"Blacksburg, VA",169,20,9.0,4.0,2017-12-09,"I love brewery/restaurant combos so I was really excited to try BJs. They have quite a variety of in house beers along with guest/outside beers. Their food is ""American"", but takes inspiration from other cuisines. I couldn't choose because they have such a variety: Salads, burgers, chicken, fish, steak, flatbreads, deep dish pizza. The list goes on.  I got a flight and a pint. The flight was worth it, in my opinion, especially because they have so many beers. The bar area includes booths so if you like to hit happy hour it is a comfy place to do that with great prices on their house crafted beer. The food all sounded so amazing. My boyfriend called his dish ""chicken amazingness"" while BJs called it ""Parmesan Crusted Chicken"". And the taste really was amazing. However, the plating of this dish was disappointing to say the least. He had a huge helping of food and they made it look like nothing by stacking the chicken on top of his sides. This also resulted in some of the crusting coming off, which my boyfriend didn't mind, but a good restaurant would avoid doing. I originally ordered the ""Lemon Thyme Chicken"", but it came out basically as a rice soup because there was so much sauce. I then switched my order to the Blackened Alaskan Salmon and was not disappointed. The sauce was great and the salmon was cooked well.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend the beer, but would likely go back for appetizers or more simple dishes as the kitchen staff seems a little careless. Additionally the wait staff was extremely attentive and understanding!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,3.16,2.78,2.932,,2.9320000000000004

My favorite was the Brunette from the Dark Side flight. Overall, pretty good food and beer, unfortunately I cannot give this place a higher rating because of the poor service that I received.  My friend had made a reservation for 20 people, and I understand it was a large table, and they would be busy. Our flights came out fast and my friends pizookie came out in a couple minutes. But the nachos and the fries took an hour. The two of us were not getting a full meal because we had to leave the party a little early. I had to flag down our server an hour in to check on the status of my nachos (which I'd expect to come out quick because it was an appetizer!). When he came back he told me it had come out 3 times and no one claimed it. I don't know where they were calling this but I did not hear this at all! And we were not that loud! They must have not even bothered to walk around the table--I sat at the center! I did hear them call once for nachos (and some cauliflower) but it was for someone who was not even at our table. My server said they threw it away and it would take another ten minutes for it come out. And he told me that next time I should listen more carefully (!!!???). I was not at the bar, I was sitting at a table, and this seemed like a sit down restaurant where I should not have to be chasing down my food. We also asked about the fries and received an ""Oh yeah"" and it came out immediately, no apology.  And all this time, we asked for water 5 times to several different servers and never received it. It was not so much a big deal for me because I had beer, but my friend who was not drinking really wanted it. With all the problems we were having and the fact we had to leave soon, we gave up on the water. I know it was a large table but we had a reservation, management should have staffed appropriately for a busy night, and I feel water is something that should be offered as you walk around the tables and see some people do not have water or their glasses are empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,3.0,2.74,2.92,,2.8440000000000003

It's a great place to watch a game, but if it's a big game, get there early or make a reservation, or it will be hard to get seated.  The menu is large, varied, Americana. Always something for everyone on this type of menu. I specifically like the pot stickers, rib appetizer, and nacho flatbread. Pizookies, their version of skillet cookie dessert, which come in many flavors... Yummy!! Definitely get it! The staff is friendly and helpful. They don't always know the answer, but they go and ask. We like the rewards system and the technology they use. We have the BJs app on our phones. When you arrive at the host stand you scan your rewards number in. Then your server already knows you are a rewards member and can see what rewards you have available to use that visit. Redeeming rewards is super easy and the server will do it before bringing your check if you ask.  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons. Usually they make mistakes. I haven't gone down to 3 stars because the staff is really accommodating and the food is very tasty. Even if they have to fix mistakes, which should not happen, the food you get is really good. The other thing is the cocktails are not always made with fresh ingredients. I do not like when any restaurant uses something like Rose's lime juice, or any other mixer with preservatives, instead of fresh limes. I am a mojito person and I do not want a mojito made with a mixer, or something preserved with sulfites. Note: if you have a sulfite allergy, as I do, you cannot have the ginger beer they use here. It has sulfites. On two different occasions when asking about fresh lime juice versus rose's (or the like) I got two different answers. So double check if you have dietary issues.  We will return again and again, and I would recommend to friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vienna-2,3.2,2.79,2.912,,2.9540000000000006
