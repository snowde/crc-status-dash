She (and I) love the pizza, it's always fun to hear her specify ""cheese only"" to the waitstaff who are always friendly. Drinks are good as you'd expect at a place like this, my wife loves their Mojitos while I like sampling different beers. Other favorites are the Jambalaya, Meatloaf, shredded pork sandwiches, onion strings, and thin cut fries. Nice relaxing place though there is often a wait.

190,Amanda H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",13,5,,2.0,2012-05-07,"So after a funeral, around 25 of us decided to stop in for lunch to visit and enjoy a great meal (or so we'd hoped)...alas, that was not to be the case. This is a review of the experience had by my husband, our 13-year old son and myself.   My husband ordered a beer...waitress came back and said they didn't have it. This happened 4 times. Finally, my husband opened the beer menu and asked the waitress to tell her what they did have. She pointed to a long page of beer names and said that they only had the first beer listed on the page.  She mentioned quite a few of BJ's microbrews and some of the more 'routine' beers.  He finally found one they had in stock.  Then, I ordered a frozen margarita. it was half melted and pretty gross. I asked my husband if he wanted it... he took a sip and said it was too gross to drink. I then ordered an unsweetened tea. I had to ask 2 people over 10min for the tea. They finally brought me a sweet tea. I sent it back and said it needs to be unsweet. (I'm not diabetic but I try to avoid sugar when I can and Splenda works just as well as sugar for tea)...so she brings the correct tea and our appetizer. It also took about 40 minutes and asking 3 people for our son to get his Sierra Mist.  Now the appetizer:   We wanted something simple and ordered chips/salsa.  The salsa was pretty good. It had fire roasted tomatoes and a very good flavor. The chips were a mix of blue corn tortilla, red and white tortilla chips. They were not greasy and very flavorful, but too few. It made our $5.95 appetizer look sparse.   All the food came out in an appropriate time for a group of our size. Now, I will say that of the 20 people at our table, almost everyone had something wrong with their meal. My husband ordered jambalaya. He said it good but a small size for a $15.95 meal. I ordered a baked potato with the basics...cheese, bacon, sour cream, butter and chives. I had to pay $1.95 extra for the bacon and cheese. The baked potato was very dry and tasted old. I'm not sure how else to describe the flavor. The toppings were sparse (especially when I had to pay extra). The brought out a side dish with what appeared to be sour cream with the chives on top. So I loaded my fork with potato and dipped it in the 'sour cream' and chives then took the bite...it was only then did I learn that I'd just taken a huge bite of butter with chives on it. All I can say is ""ewww""...I didn't eat anymore after that. My son ordered a cheese pizza. It also had fire roasted tomatoes on top. It was cheese bread (no sauce) with tomatoes sprinkled on top. The majority of the pizza was crust. It was poorly prepared and (I think) $14.95. When a 13-year old boy won't eat a pizza, you know something isn't right. :-)  There were other issues as well:  I couldn't get a refill on my tea, was unable to get a to go tea, my son never got his drink refilled.  Oh, on a side note...this restaurant would not let us make a reservation, even with such a large group. To read this, I'm sure you're thinking that I complain a lot, but let me assure you, my husband and I are very easy-going people.  We enjoy friendly interactions with the wait staff, aren't overly picky about minor food issues and rarely every complain to a manager (I can think of 3 time in the past year, including this outing).  That being said, some things warrant speaking with the store manager and when that doesn't bring desired results, going to the next level manager.  This is one of those times.  Let me explain (the short version): When it was time to pay, my husband put his credit card in the folder and gave it to the waitress.  Three other groups at the table paid with cards.  About 20 minutes later, the waitress walked over to my husband and loudly told him that his credit card was declined.  While she handed my husband the folder, she held up another folder and asked loudly, ""who is Charles ...""  My husband said that was him and she handed him the second folder.  We then realized, she'd given us someone else's credit card (the one that had been declined).  They'd put our bill with the wrong card and someone else's bill with our card.  (Are you confused yet?)  We take our credit card safety very seriously.  We have close friends who have been the victims of identity theft.  They had excellent credit history...now, after the theft, they've filed for bankruptcy and are struggling to rebuild their credit.  We spoke with the manager, who completely blew us off.  He didn't care to listen to our concerns and asked us if we'd ""be happy"" with a $20 dollar BJ's gift card.  He handed it to my husband before he could answer.  I guarantee the gift card is useless.  We will not be returning to BJ's anywhere.  We feel that it's average food for above average prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.6000000000000005,3.2800000000000002

I mean really cold.  It was about 1/5 full of people.  Bad sign.  It took 15 minutes for our waiter to arrive. It took another ten for the water to get there.  I don't know why it took so long.  He only had a three table section.  The girl who ran our food practically threw the plates at us.   I had the chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables.  She had the mahi tacos.  Both were horrible.  Her tortillas were stale.  My steak was soggy and dry. The gravy was runny and there wasn't enough of it.  The mashed potatoes were hard.  One more time, hard, yes hard.  How do you do that? It was almost like they were powdered.  The ""steamed"" vegetables had liquid running all over the plate desperately trying to soften the potatoes.  (Which actually kinda worked.)  The liquid residue means that the veggies were microwaved in a plastic bag and then cut open to be poured on the plate.  You are supposed to drain the liquid first.  Someone didn't bother to.   This place is horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=140,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.5640000000000005,3.3200000000000003
191,Kristie E.,"Webster, TX",4,17,16.0,4.0,2013-01-02,Great brew house to try some non cookie-cutter beers.  The service is usually pretty good and the food.....very good. One of my favorite things on the menu is there chicken wontons and both the sauces (thai and buffalo) are tasty. Everything I've tried there is so good. Their menu is really expansive so I had to start pulling choices out of a baggie blindly so that I'm not tempted to get the same thing everytime. I definitely recommend this place if you don't mind spending a little more than usual. Very casual and relaxed place with a little fancier decor.

Their pizza is deep-dish style: very doughy and usually very light on the sauce.  I prefer thin-crust pizza, so I usually go for one of their flatbread appetizer pizzas as my meal.  They run about $10.  I've had the roasted veggie and goat cheese and the California BLT-style one.  The goat cheese and veggie was better, but both were very light on toppings.  there were maybe about 8 tiny chunks of avocado on my BLT pizza.  very disappointing. The best things about BJ's are their in-house microbrew beers, which are pretty good, and their p'zookies--a cookie baked in a mini pizza pan and topped with ice cream.  really, that's all I come here for.  all of the other food is kind of meh. and the prices are always surprisingly high....we got the appetizer flat bread pizza, a chicken marsala, a p'zookie and split an app of spinach artichoke dip...and the bill was $38!  Not a great value, especially considering our meals didn't come with soup or salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8600000000000003,3.1600000000000006
129,Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",36,173,2.0,4.0,2013-05-10,My wife and I were out running errands last night (Thursday) and realized we hadn't stopped for dinner. It was 10pm. Started looking for a place to eat that was not fast food. All of the restaurants close at 10. Our first three choices were already closed. The only option left was BJ's. It would be nice if more places than Chili's and IHOP stayed open past 10:00 on weeknights. just my opinion.  Ok moving on- ended up at BJ's in Webster. We have been to the one in Pearland numerous times so we are accustomed to the high prices for average food. I am a coke zero drinker and when I asked if they had coke zero I was told no. I said ok I will take a diet coke then. I was told Diet Pepsi was as close as I was going to get. I ended up with Diet Pepsi and it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I ordered the deep dish pizza and I know it takes time to cook. We were not in a hurry and I would rather it come out hot and overcooked rather than just barely done and luke warm. I ordered Pepperoni and Onion. what came out was Pepperoni and bacon. I took a slice off and started eating it. Realizing that it was not my pizza I sent it back. The waiter picked up the pizza and took it away. I was left wondering what they did with it since it had already been served. Anyway there was nothing wrong with my wife's order so she enjoyed her calzone why I sat and watched her eat.  The waiter admitted he put it in wrong and the correct pizza would be right out. For the price of their food I expect it right the first time. To give our server credit he was very busy with numerous tables.  Once the pizza came out my wife was almost finished with her dinner so I had two slices and I was done.  When the bill came it was $70!! the server forgot to take off the incorrect pizza. I guess I wouldn't have been irritated if would have been apologetic.  Anyway got correct bill and we were on our way. The visit could have been smoother but at that time of night you have very little options on where to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=120,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9600000000000004,3.2000000000000006

126,A. S.,"Houston, TX",58,119,14.0,3.0,2013-05-27,"BJ's is like a mini- Cheesecake Factory in terms of the ridiculous amount of items on their menu, and you have to know what to get or you'll be smack in the middle of ""meh"" city. Think upscale Chili's fare (with bonus pizza!) The pizza is the best thing about this place. With the wide availability of good craft beer in the area, the need for a sub-par brew pub is nil, but then again BJ's is a monster chain to be reckoned with. The beers range from middle-of-the-road to just plain mundane and all the way back to so-so. I like that they added the ""small bites"" section of the menu to beef up their (often) scant entrees. The size of the appetizers is almost laughable. We've had nearly every appetizer, from avocado egg rolls to calamari to buffalo wings and while boyfriend claims the wings are ""boss"", I can't say they amount to much above what we could get cheaper elsewhere. Six TINY wings on a plate, that'll be $9 please.  The servers are rarely friendly, the hostesses often aloof and busy toiling in teenage angst, and the food is always sluggish getting out of the kitchen. Sit in the bar area, get really good happy hour pricing/specials. If you don't sit in the bar, they won't tell you that happy hour prices do not apply. Enjoy your $60 tab for two!

Wife and I sat at the full service bar for drinks and appetizers, and to watch game 5 of the NBA finals. After asking for drinks without being offered any, and having to ask for menus and flagging down one of the two bartenders to put in our order, our apps were served. We had the ahi poste, which was really good, and the black and bleu flat bread pizza, which was also put together really well.  The food was good, the service was lacking. For a self proclaimed ""Brewhouse,"" neither of the bartenders knew how to properly pour a craft beer. The IPA was super foamy, and no attempt was made to remedy the discrepancy. The stout was poured haphazardly from the tap and splashed into the glass, and the head looked as if someone had shaken a soapy glass of soda. On four or five different occasions, floor servers brought back drinks from dining room customers who were not satisfied with their drinks.  No management interaction, coupled with bartenders who kept their backs to the customers in order to watch the game instead of paying attention to their patrons brings this review down significantly. Decent plates and a better than average selection of beer is their only saving grace.

74,Dean H.,"Hurricane, UT",0,27,,5.0,2013-12-01,"BJ's BREWHOUSE A NICE SURPRISE! OK, so we picked BJ's Brewhouse, in Webster, TX, because we were desperate. We had just checked into our hotel across the street (Thursday, 11/14/13) after a twenty-three hour, two-day drive from Vegas, and we were famished.  The parking lot was packed so we figured ""Twenty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong.""  Right? Right!  BJ's proved a very pleasant surprise (it was our first time there).  No actual Frenchmen were spotted. We requested a seat as far from the madding crowds as possible, and were given a corner booth next to the kitchen, away from the giant TV screen on which droned some football game.  Perfect.  We couldn't escape the overall din of a packed house with TVs everywhere, but hunger drove us to examine the menu and ignore the din. Presently we were proffered drinks, and soon thereafter along came our very personable and capable waitress, Cheyenne.  We asked her advice on menu choices, asked several detailed questions, requested 2-3 alterations and additions, and Cheyenne was off to put in our order. I took her recommendation and ordered a pint of her personal favourite brewsky, the Jeremiah Red (light, a bit sweet, not overpowering), and followed it with the Angus burger melt on sourdough.  My wife went for the fried artichoke appetizer and a heaping bowl of chicken noodle comfort soup.  All dishes came out exactly as ordered, and tasted great. The ambiance was ""upscale brewhouse"" with leather booths ringing the room and tables scattered throughout.  The crowd was largely young and hip, with the exception of us two old farts in the corner. Yes, we'd go back again.  Yes, we'd ask for the delightful Cheyenne.  Yes, I'd have another Jeremiah Red.  No, we'd skip going on a Thursday night, if we could avoid it.  Gets a bit rowdy for our tastes.  Might be just right for yours.

And lots of other alcohol - wine, sangria, mojitos, martinis, etc.  The food is pretty good. I like their lighter menu. My favorite item is the mahi or shrimp tacos, which you can get grilled or fried and they come with chips and salsa. Pretty good and under 1,000 calories (most things on the menu ARE NOT).  They're known for the pazookie (sp?) which is a warm cookie and ice cream and which is, of course, amazing.  Overall, I like BJ's well enough.

There hasn't been an occasion for it to come up in recent years so maybe this had been fixed, but they used to have a very rigid seating system.  If you didn't want to sit where they dictated it became a BIG deal and sometimes they refused to let you choose a location of your preference until you asked for the manager.  Edited 7/18/14 to add: On our trip tonight we did their corn fritter appetizer and the Roast Beef Dip.  You have to look carefully to find any corn in the corn fritters.  The roast beef dip was good but not exceptional.  The horseradish needed some zip.  If they hadn't said it was horseradish I would have thought it was cream sauce.   Added on 2/24/2016: We haven't been here since the last update in 2014,  We had the avocado egg rolls.  They're still good and I had my weekly martini which is a little pricey here, $7.50 I think and not generous.  Oh yes, they don't brew any beer here.  I know, I know, it's called a brewhouse but  those giant tanks are just ornaments.  Added on 6/24/2017: Back again.  My martini is still to expensive and skimpy.  You can see we come here regularly -- about once a year.  Tonight it was a good experience.  Our waiter had a trainee and both were pleasant and responsive.  With some trepidation we ordered the DEEP DISH ZITI.  It turned out to be excellent.  And we had their salted caramel Pizookie.  O my god, best thing short of an orgasm.

The service was slow, however, unless each large group calls ahead, events like this can't truly be planned for in advance. The huge disappointment was the server who brought the wrong non alcoholic drink to my friends who eat there quite a bit. My friend explained to the server that her drink was not correct. The server responded it was basically the same. I had to contain my laughter because this is exactly the type of instance the managers at BJ's probably don't envision for employee if the month.This coupled with forgetting to enter our dessert order at the end of the meal made this a very laughable experience.  My second visit was this past Friday evening.

My BF and I visited the restaurant on Sunday around 1 to catch a few games and eat. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and wings (food was excellent as always). The issue is when we were closing our tab: I typically don't review the bill and just know if it's about $30, it's about right. Well I know my BF only had 2 beers and yet there were 3 on there, an extra $4.00 charge. The bartender saw us questioning each other and said ""oh, I added an extra beer, just incase you wanted another but I can take it off if you are done""... Ummm HELL NO! Do not charge us for something WE DID NOT get! Now I wonder how many times we have paid for stuff we did not receive and so should everyone else.

By the time all of us were done, we sat for 10-15 more minutes with a table full of dishes and glasses. No action.

I have a couple of favorites: Mahi Mahi tacos and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  The fish tacos are SO flavorful. I get the fish grilled and it is flaky with great taste. The meal comes with chips and salsa, but I don't even care about that since the tacos are so good. The chicken is to die for! You get two thin cut breasts with excellent breading. They top it with sun dried tomatoes and basil plus this lemon cream sauce that you'll want to drink, it is so good! The chicken comes with broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. This meal may not be low carb, but it is worth it. There is enough food that I always end up taking some home for later. Another favorite is the fish and chips. The fish is not overly greasy and they always cook it just right. Also, if you ask, they will bring you malt vinegar.  I am not a beer drinker, but I love their house-made root beer.

56,Arturo R.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",46,8,9.0,3.0,2015-06-13,Food was pretty tasty. The service was ok. Not exceptional but I can see how if you don't keep the waiter in check they will get away from you. I read a lot about the avocado egg rolls and tried them. They were good the sauce was great but they were pretty mushy and once cold not appetizing.  My biggest complaint was I ordered two Red Buffalos one was perfect but the second was totally wrong. The waiter asked if I had a problem with it and I said I didn't think it was a Red Buffalo. He took it back to the bar and the bar tender claimed it was a Red Buffalo and that it was just cloudy.  Now I have been drinking Back and Tans for many years and various Black and something combinations. The beer they brought me just didn't measure up. So after letting it settle for several minutes it still didn't look right and the taste was definitely WRONG. I finally sent it back and the manager got involved although he and the bar tender maintained it was a Red Buffalo. Claiming it was due to a barrel change.  I'm sorry it can't be true. I changed my order to a Dark Castle and it was perfect. Needless to say I will probably be back. But if your into beer as I am and that's the reason I wanted to try this place. Don't let them try to pull the proverbial wool over your eyes and serve you something you didn't order. Especially since we ordered Hefeweizen but got a Blonde.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=60,2.6,3.02,3.02,3.1160000000000005,2.8520000000000003

Felt bad the waitress kept asking if we were ready to order but if you have 120 items with description to each, it's going to take some time to decide. A good reason to come here is the fact there is so much variety. In house brewed beer but opted for a shiner bock. Ordered the Santa Fe Spring Rolls thinking they were like the Chili's southwestern egg rolls. Nope, not at all alike. These are smaller in size, good, but not what I expected. I think there's 10 halves to an order. Also had the lunch Southern Fried Chicken. It's one breaded chicken breast over a heap of mashed potatoes surrounded by corn with cream gravy on top.

Yeah, no thanks, we would like to sit over here.  I ordered a burger with a wedge salad. I asked what came on the salad, the waiter told me, only he left it it would be covered in tomatoes. I am deathly allergic. They brought another one with out the tomatoes, but with a long black hair!! I didn't know that could still happen in 2015, but there it was. The salad went back.

Even though the place was empty, the food took absurdly long to arrive. When the food finally did come, my youngest son's food was missing. That took another five minutes. So all in all, about 35 minutes for freaking kids chicken tenders and fries. The order of mozzarella sticks had a napkin between them and the plate. I assume this is to catch some of the grease. Except when you pull one up from the plate, now your mozzarella stick has paper napkin all over it. I snagged a piece of my wife's pizza. Very underwhelming with a gummy crust.

Servers on the other hand are making sure many costumes don't return. Both waiters and waitresses are always rushing you, they are very cold when it comes to welcome you as a costumer, there have been many times when I have to ask for things 2-3 times & they don't even say ""sorry"" for forgetting. Look at the tables, seats, & floors...they are dirty!!! all the time. But this one is the worst and it happened twice. Waiter cleaned the floor with rags, put them underneath arm, wiped his hand on the side of his pants and grabbed my check to be paid..I can only see cross contamination there. A couple of days later, I called the manager and explained what happen. He said they'll address that asap. Guess what!! I went this past weekend and the same thing!! Dirty booths, dirty chairs, dirty floors, waitress was close to mean, and I could see her grabbing three glasses with one hand from the inside. I wonder if they go and wash their hands before handing out the next meal. Enough!!! They make me feel like my money has to be given...no! It has to be earned! Response: I did called the manager right after 1st event. We spoke about this issue and he said ""thank you for your feedback"" and he also said he'd talk to them. Since me and husband like the food, we went again the following week to find that nothing changed and that's why I have written about it for the second time. That's why I wrote my review because I already called and see no improvement. Thx So we went again during June for both husband's birthday and Father's Day and a couple of times this past week (1st week of August) just because I love the fried asparagus. I'd like to suggest the asparagus (all the fried ones and, grilled and steamed) to be cut shorter as the base of the steam is always hard to eat (very fibrous)  Also, maybe the meat can be more marinated as it's coming out very hard and not much flavor when I asked for it ""well done"".

They have made some changes to their menu but they still have a great variety of  food and beverage options. We didn't order any appetizers but the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts and the Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus caught my eye. They added a bunch of cocktails to the menu. My friend and I both had the Hendricks Cucumber Lemonade. It was so good and refreshing!  For dinner I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was really delicious! It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The side dishes were awesome, but unfortunately they only put four broccoli florets on the plate. I thought maybe there were more hiding under the chicken or mashed potatoes, but there weren't. That was disappointing because it was really good. Of course the portion of chicken and mashed potatoes were massive, especially compared to the broccoli. I of course had to have a Pizookie for dessert. They added a few new flavors, but I opted for chocolate chunk because you can't go wrong. It was really good, but it was stuck to the skillet. We eventually had to ask for a knife to help scrape it off the bottom. My friend had the beignet and it was hard to cut through as well. The outside was really crispy and good but you still needed a knife to break through it because the spoon wasn't doing a very good job. I was expecting a traditional beiginet. This looked more like some sort of circular pastry thing with berries and whipped cream. No powdered sugar. It wasn't even that doughy. It was good, just different that the traditional beignet that I was expecting.  The wait staff was awesome and professional.

Clearly their added quantity of items led to a decrease in quality. The pizza was ICE COLD. The cheese was hard not stringy, and the crust was soggy. Even the pan was cold to the touch, indicating the pizza had been out of the oven for at least 30 minutes. Considering the large group of 20 seated, we likely received an extra from their party.

My wife, son, and I came in early Friday evening.  We wanted to beat the rush to get to a movie.  We arrived around 6:00 PM and beat the rush.  Literally 10 minutes later, there was a wait.  We were quickly seated and the service was spot on.  Drinks were ordered and brought to us.  Speaking of drinks, they have really good lemonade.  I ordered the Root Beer Wings as an appetizer.  My wife ordered a pizza so she and I could split it.  My son ordered one of the burgers with no onions and no mayo.  Yes, we realize this wasn't our healthiest meal of the week.  Our server specifically asked if we wanted the appetizer before the meal or with the rest of the food.  I asked if them to bring it before the meal.   We didn't wait too long for the food.  However, my son received his burger with onions and mayo.  The manager was one of the people that helped deliver our food.  She noticed the onions and said, ""Oh, I see this has onions on it.  Is that OK?""  He said it was ok simply because it wasn't smothered in them and we were going to a movie so he would just take them off.  When he took the top bun off, he also noticed the burger had mayo.  He ended up sending it back and waiting for another one.  Magically, it was prepared correctly in about 2 minutes (literally).  Our server stated it was already ready but the person serving the food (remember the manager?) had grabbed the wrong burger.  He apologized.  The pizza was on a thin crust and tasted pretty good.  A thin crust pizza at BJ's is really thin but that is the way we like it so it was fine.  My wife ended up taking some of it home to eat as lunch the next day.  If you notice, I did not mention the wings yet.  That is because I did not get them yet.  I was supposed to get them before the meal.  It was an appetizer.  We got them after the rest of the food.  I've never had their Root Beer Wings so I didn't really know what to expect.  The sauce is the same texture as a BBQ sauce.  Simply, it is a BBQ sauce with a root beer flavor.  I liked it ok but won't rush back to order it again.  We ended up eating a free dessert because of all of the mix-ups. Bottom Line:  Food is average and the staff needs to pay better attention to their orders upon delivery to the table.  It may be a couple more years before I go back again.  Bon appétit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.12,3.15,3.15,,3.138
38,Ana G.,"Houston, TX",4,1,,1.0,2017-08-24,"What drew me to this location was the fact that they described their deep dish pizza as a ""Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza""!! However I ended up paying $27.25 for a pan pizza. When I asked the waitress who brought my food to curbside if it was the right pizza, she insisted they only had two pizzas so it had to be a deep dish. If your advertising deep dish then it should be deep dish. I was not satified at all with this false advertisement!! Laziness is not acceptable either. If the waitress didnt want to walk back to correct order she should of just canceled everything and told the truth instead of just say it was right when the picture of the pizza looks nothing close to what i got!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=20,2.96,3.14,3.14,,3.0680000000000005

17,Benny Jas. B.,"Friendswood, TX",16,16,,3.0,2017-09-17,"Here's a wonderfully designed and tastefully themed sports-bar-style facility - appears to be well kept, but also a little empty.  The menu includes a great helping of American fare (burgers & fries, etc.), with a sizable section for great pizzas, and an oversized/full bar!  The pricing scenario seems a bit higher than other restaurants of this type - almost 15% to 30% more than you might expect to pay, but the food is good, and if you've got that kind of money you would like to hang out there with drinking buddies, watching sports and galavanting.  Probably, this price gouge is the reason the place seems so empty.  But, when you got the cash you can practically have this place all to your semi-private party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.04,3.15,3.15,,3.106
24,Karen Y.,"Houston, TX",168,187,119.0,2.0,2017-09-23,"I wasn't going to write this review at first, since BJ's IS a chain restaurant that you normally wouldn't expect anything too far over mediocre for, but my most recent experience here inspired me to post my thoughts. Before this, I had always seen BJ's as a pretty solid place to eat with family or friends. This time, however, the food was the worst I've ever tasted from BJ's. I ordered the clam chowder and caesar salad combo, which was a big mistake in itself. It was somehow the worst chowder and salad I've ever had at a restaurant, which is not surprising because this isn't a particularly healthy or seafood-y restaurant. The waiter was really courteous but barely seemed to pay attention to our table, besides bringing us food and the occasional water refill. He didn't even clear our dinner plates before bringing out our pizookies. The pizookies were the only redeeming part of the meal, but then again, pizookies are really hard to mess up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=20,2.96,3.13,3.13,,3.062
16,Nicolette M.,"Webster, TX",200,23,,3.0,2017-10-03,"There's a lot of convenience that comes with this place. You can order it online and pick it up or dine in. I've done both. Service is friendly enough and the food is consistent each time. Once I've ordered a hamburger where the seasoning was so over done that it was actually crunchy. I nearly felt sick and couldn't finish the food. Other times the food has been fine. It's a hit or miss kind of place so I'll go there if I have to. It's not something I crave, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,2.96,3.14,3.14,,3.0680000000000005

Not an easy task to pull off any day, any time. But they did it with flying colors. I want to single out our server, Brian. Brian took on our very 'challenging' family and sailed through the lunch like a real pro. There wasn't a hiccup the entire visit and the family were all very pleased with their food and especially the service by Brian. Large parties are extremely difficult but he handled it like it was a table for 2. Brian, this is a real talent and to do so very naturally and with ease that allows the diner to relax and enjoy their experience. This is true hospitality.  Thank you to Brian and the staff at BJ's Webster",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.2,3.22,3.22,,3.2120000000000006

The club sandwiches are also great.  Service is  usually great once you get to a table.  But be prepared for a wait to get a table.  The place is crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.28,3.23,3.23,,3.25
1,Scott B.,"Houston, TX",2,7,,4.0,2018-01-05,"I arrived at 530 pm on a Friday hoping to catch happy hour prices and get ahead of the dinner rush.  Easily found a seat at a high top table in the bar area. The atmosphere is fine (granite tabletops, brick walls, high ceilings), music is not too loud, and there are 6 TVs behind the bar tuned to all the usual sports channels. Noise level is high enough already that I can imagine it might be a bit much at peak times. Decided to order 2 selections from the Happy Hour menu: Dark Horse Cabernet, $5, normal price $7.75 Avocado Egg Rolls, $6, normal price $10.95 Wine is unexceptional but perfectly fine for the  price.  There are 6 egg rolls on the plate, enough for 2 people. They are deep fried and hot with a very sweet dipping sauce. Calories are super-high so watch out. But avocados are  healthy fats, right? Overall I am going to rate this place pretty high. Why? Because it is better than just about  any other comparable place. I have been here many times and have been going out to eat in Houston since the 80s, so I have pretty much tried them all. The menu is huge (24 pages!) and has calorie counts for everything so anyone should be able to find something they like. Prices are reasonable.  Higher than Chili's and lower than       PF Changs. The usual downside of going to BJs is that it is very popular at peak times and staff has a hard time keeping up. Bottom line I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly better than Fridays, Chili's, Marie Callendar (are they still around?), BWW, Hooters and it's imitators. Maybe on par with Brickhouse and a step below Houston's (told you I have been to them all). Now I am am going to dig into a seared Ahi salad ($15.50, big enough for two), relax, and contemplate my new hobby as a restaurant critic on Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.24,3.25,3.25,,3.246
0,John D.,"La Marque, TX",59,176,288.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"Excuse my use of slang, but it was a minute between tonight and the last time I hit up BJ's. The last time I paid a visit was give or take three years ago. I came here earlier with my nephew, who'll return to college in San Antonio in a few days. We were fortunate to have Vanessa as our waitress; she sat us in front of a TV that was showing NFL Network. In my book, it's a plus to watch some tube -- especially sports -- while eating and drinking. We began with the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler consisting of boneless buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls. The item was big enough to feed two people. We were close to stuffed by the time our main meals arrived. I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was accompanied by an ample serving of fries. Not like it matters, but for some reason, I forgot to douse the fries with ketchup. Good thing they were tasty without the Heinz. I really enjoyed the sandwich. Simply put, it can best be described as a sizable piece of fried chicken nicely coated with a variety of seasoning and spices in between a bun. The pickles gave the fowl a solid sour kick. I managed to finish it despite being full from the appetizers. As for the rating, BJ's actually scores a 4.5. The restroom could be maintained better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2,3.32,3.24,3.24,,3.2720000000000007
