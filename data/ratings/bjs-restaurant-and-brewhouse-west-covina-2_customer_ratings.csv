594,Tommy K.,"Covina, CA",7,6,,3.0,2012-01-02,"We visited this location on New Years Eve, simply because we'd gone there last New Years Eve and it was so good. What a difference a year makes. We got there at 6pm and were seated right away. Service was good.  I ordered the Pot Roast with Roasted Vegetables. The roast was tender just like the menu said it would be, it would have been great if the gravy that covered the meat didn't have so much salt. There's no reason for anything to have that much salt. The dinner came with 'roasted' vegetables, Celery, onion and carrots, none of which were completely cooked. The carrots were ugly looking, with lots of white lines in them.

616,Oliver H.,"Irvine, CA",42,10,,1.0,2012-01-19,"This place has the worst service.... Came here on a thursday night, and was told that I would wait 10 to 15 minutes. More than 30 minutes has passed, and I decided to go ask the hostess what was taking so long. First thing the hostess says is we called you why weren't you here. Then in her bitchy attitude she expresses to me that probably the paging system is broken. Without ever apologizing for the extremely long wait, she starts to question that i wasn't in the room waiting, and that it is entirely my fault that. Then we are lead to a table, then again the second hostess realizes that the table wasn't even cleaned. Then another 10 minute wait, until I express my dissatisfaction to the first hostess, and she starts blaming me again for the wait.   The food here is nothing spectacular, rather overpriced affair. I would much prefer yardhouse, lazy dog, cheese cake or other similar institutions. Bj's serioulsy needs to improve their service.

524,Alan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,132,64.0,2.0,2012-01-29,"I'm preaching similar reviews that give this particular chain 2-3 stars.   If you don't mind long waits and slow service, then this place is for you.   Let's start with the positives - the atmosphere is pretty much the same as any BJ's.  I've been to the Glendale and Montebello chains for lunch and never had any issues.  I came to this one last night (for the first time) with a group of 15.  Although we called in advanced, we still had to wait for 45 minutes.    I expected waiting since we had a large group and this was a peak Saturday night time. (8pm)  At around the 30 minute wait mark, I overhead the manager tell the person who controlled the front desk to let the party of 8 and 6 go ahead of our group.  I was ready to tell our group to walk over to Islands restaurant which I saw from the distance.  I don't like to complain to the front desk person/greeter or whatever you call them.  I was polite but she must be having a bad evening.  She gave excuses such as: ""well you should call days in advance if you have large party"" ""10 more minutes....""  (repeatedly) The worst excuse for the long wait was: ""you didn't tell me your entire party was here.  Ok, now we can put you in the queue"" (or words to that effect)  My friend was more assertive with the manager and eventually we got were seated.  By the ways, the gal/greeter who manned the front gave me this bitchy look and said, ""next time you should phone several days in advanced""  (Ok, I guess this place isn't good for impomptu dinners) The food is consistently okay (as with the rest of chain).   The pizza was delicious as usual.  Since we had a large party, we had two servers.  We  ordered our food as soon as we were seated.  Since we were waiting in the lobby, we tried to make sure we knew what to order since we were hungry.  I was fortunate to be at the end of the table which had quicker delivery of the food.  The other end had the slow service.  They got their pizza and calzone AFTER we finished ours.   (Yes, we passed some of our food to them.  How much longer?  About 40 minutes!  Yes!  Again, one person in our party assertively spoke to the manager who said dessert on the house.   Hence, my rating goes from two stars to three stars.  Geez Louis, we could have ordered a pizza and had it delivered quicker.  One of my buddies was tempted to that at the 20 minute wait period.  If we did that, the waiter probably would have spit in our food. I don't believe the bad service was intentional.  I simply believe they can't handle the peak times. So my advice to you if you go at Saturday/Friday night and if you have a large party:   - expect 1.5 hours  - split up your party - I don't think the servers are happy to work in a demanding environment - if you are in rush, skip this restaurant and find a nearby restaurant. The place is probably a 3 star if we did not have to wait and given the run around. If you have a large group of 10 or more, this place is a 2 stars.   A two-stars in Yelp implies ""I've experienced better""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=520,3.0,3.25,3.25,2.9840000000000004,3.15

She gave us our bill when half my families food was still on their plate.  We hadn't even ordered desert or been asked if we wanted any. I put the bill down on the table, waiting for our desert.  She proceeded to stop by and attempt to pick it up three times.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you pay once you've concluded your meal, right?  This happened to me at Montebello BJ's but nowhere near as bad as this. This also happened in Burbank, but the server was extremely nice and said not to worry about it until we were absolutely done. And he kept his word and never bothered us.

I had been there like 5 years ago and had bad service and haven't been back till tonight. When I called to make reservations they put it down at the wrong time and my brother called to do the same not knowing I already did and they never wrote it down. So tonight a drink was spilt on my niece, my nephew and I didn't get our breadsticks, my other niece never got her steak (we asked and it was dropped on the floor so they had to make a new one and never thought to let us know...they eneded up having to give it to her to go and her baked potatoe got cold waiting. poor girl only ate a salad) I had to clean off the tables for the pies that i had to ask for them to bring a couple of times to be brought then get handed all the packs of forks to pass out too (since I'm so good at ""working"" there) OH BTW!!! did I mention that while i was cleaning, the waiters were standing around texting laughing and talking like 5 feet away, and when the guy decided to get off his butt to clean the table off (which I was almost done doing for him) he told my boyfriend that I should apply!!!! WTH?!?!?! How about just doing your job?! So much for my brother having a great dinner. Oh well... won't be going back. The manager did try to help but as he is helping us on one side they were still messing up on the other side. We had to just suck it up and get out of there because there was no way the manager could keep fixing the staffs problems. We probably should have got our whole meal free. However not even that would make any of our party of 17 go back. The 1 star is only because of the manager trying to help.

They have happy hour special drinks either by the bottle or in a pitcher.  The food is good, and the service is awesome.  All the waiters/waitresses are very friendly.  They constantly check up on you to make sure all is fine. I've ordered pasta, and sandwiches here before.  The prices are decent at around $10.00 for lunch specials, and probably about $15.00 for regular entrees.  My pasta was tasty with enough flavor... and my sandwich (half) was a turkey cobb which comes with your choice of soup and fries or potato wedges.  I chose their Tortilla soup which was delicious.  It was hot and spicy with enough kick to it.  It was so good that I had to ask for seconds which (they don't offer) I had to order another one. The turkey cobb was fresh.  The half sandwich was large enough to be a whole.   The food came out after a decent amount of time waiting.  The place is clean, and there is an abundant amount of seating for everybody.  Well, sometimes there is still a wait depending on the time of arrival.   I really like the ambiance of the restaurant.  I felt comfortable and relaxed sitting inside.  They had LCD TVs hanging which is awesome for happy hour and sporting events.

They also have excellent appetizers and food for watching sporting events on their many LCD TVs.   This is my first time here at BJ's in Covina. It's also the busiest that I've visited and we were fortunate to get seated immediately. Because its located in a large shopping lot, there's plenty of available parking.   What I like about BJ's is that they have great variety and selection of handcrafted beers. You can even combine the different varieties of beers into glass or pitcher (half and half) to create an more unique delicious flavor. Make sure to try it on your next visit to BJ's. My favorites are the Harvest Hefeweizen and Nutty Brewnette ale, so smooth, lightly sweet and refreshing. Prices weren't to bad $5.50 pint and $16 pitcher.  For appetizers, we ordered avocado egg roll, calamari and ahi poke which were all tasty and satisfyingly good.  Since we were already starting to get full from the beer and appetizers we ordered the black and bleu flat bread pizzas and BBQ chicken salad. Good portions, healthy and very delicious. Service is usually pretty decent, but today was exceptionally above and beyond its norm. They accidentally made a mistake on one of my orders and I informed the waitress. A few minutes later the manager came out, apologize for the order and hand delivered my correct order in person. Wow! That's great customer service and worth 4 stars. We were to full for dessert and the chocolate chip pizookie with double scoops of ice cream is to die for here.

It felt as though we were being rushed out. I tried to look for a manager or someone I could talk to, but there was no one around.  Other gripes that were expressed at our table was the lack of music throughout the restaurant.  Its not a deal breaker for me as I don't like loud music, but some music would have been nice.   In the end we all left dissatisfied and wondered why were treated this way.  BJ's has lost my business for good.  The Applebees in Azusa has much better service and it's a place in my opinion a notch below BJ's.  A say notch below because I feel BJ's is a tad more upscale compared to Chilli's, Friday's and Applebees, but they proved to me that is not the case in terms of service.  I was wondering if this would have been different if we were seated in the bar area and not the restaurant, but I am not willing to find out.  I would avoid this place.  There are far too many locations in this area that are more deserving of your business. Ill keep it working class at Applebee's where I always get great service and a great atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=580,3.2,3.31,3.31,2.536,3.266

This is a place you can either come dressed up or stay casual. There are a lot of college students who get dressed up and go to BJ's, but then there are a lot of people who don't dress up. If you are looking for a fun place, I would give this a try. If there's a wait, it will usually go by fairly quickly.

I joined several friends for lunch on a lazy Thursday afternoon. The noon rush was over and the place was generally empty as several severs were clustered chatting. We were seated and the usual colorful menus were given to us with a drink order asked before we had been seated ten seconds. The waitress/server appeared bored and distant and thankfully said she would return, a minute later she returned to ""take your order."" We finally ordered drinks and she pointed out the lunch specials indicating her favorites. Most notable was the flat bread with salad and the half baked potato. The flatbread was burned on the edges, dry and lacked any imagination, with its adjoining salad that lacked any significant amount of dressing. The uncooked half baked potato was drenched in some sort of chili sauce covered with sour cream and onions. The waitress/server did not return to check on whether there was any problem with the order and efforts to summon here revealed that she had left and no one knew who had replaced her. The saving grace was our conversation in seeing old friends and renewing old ties. Our party did not consume much of the food and the dishes were set aside to continue our conversation.  A person in our party physically had to find a server to bring the check and when she arrived she merely placed it on the table and left with no word regarding our food. The check was paid and she finally noticed little of the food had been consumed asking if we wanted doggie bags. We told her the food was horrible and were upset that no one attended to us, she curtly apologized and left.

They had a gluten free menu for the flatmate to delve into. Always a plus when he can eat normal meals with the rest of civilization.  Now... the best part: the pizookies. I've frequently heard of these magical mystical dishes ever since my arrival in Cali 3 months ago, but haven't had the honor of trying one before this night. Now I shall actively seek them out. BJ's had a great variety of them, which was daunting but exciting. Get a few different ones for the table, you won't be disappointed... however the gluten free flatmate might be, since they aren't GFree.

We were seated at a booth but it was to tight so the waitress put together several tables to accommodate our party. The decor and openness of this BJ's is really eye appealing and the bar is cool looking. Menu at BJ's is large  but they list the calories which I actually think is beneficial.  I ordered the Thai mango chicken avocado salad and it was yummy and tasty - about half the calories of some to the other salads but delish. The service was spot on and I was surprised BJ's didn't tack on a automatic gratuity to the tab since it was a larger party. The total came out to just under $200.00 and everyone enjoyed the food.  I would definitely come back again to BJ's for a business luncheon or personal  meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=240,2.96,3.26,3.26,2.9280000000000004,3.14

So I will say that I really enjoy this brewhouse. They have a great selection of beers on tap and my two favorites are the blonde and heff. This is a great spot for happy hour. I order the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken potstickers, lettuce wraps, ahi tuna, stuffed mushrooms, and fried artichokes. Wow...I come here A LOT! Sometimes, the service is a bit slow, but the food is great. My favorite pizza is the spinach and artichoke pizza with the full crust (not thin crust). I'm no vegetarian, but I sure do love this pizza! It melts in your mouth! And I thought only M&Ms did that... Lastly, try and save room for a delicious white chocolate pizookie. I'm always in a group where they look at me all crazy when I want to order one. I mean yes, we just stuffed ourselves with appetizers, pizza, and beer...but it's so worth it!

They were not that busy, but for some reason, our food took forever to come out--even after the large party that was seated 15 minutes after us. We flagged down the manager who apologized and said she would check on the food. Came out with everything but my son's fries and, again, apologized profusely. We started to eat but noticed everything was not hot--basically, like it had been sitting in the kitchen and they forgot to serve it. Our son ordered the mac and cheese--it was nearly room temp. Same with my husband's pizza and my fish tacos. A few minutes later, the fries came out. They were hot, of course--I suspect they made a fresh batch since fries don't keep well or warm up well. The manager could see our disgusted faces and asked if everything was okay. We asked if our food was just sitting in the kitchen and she said no, they just made them and came out of the kitchen (BOLD. FACE. LIE.) Needless to say, we didn't finish our food. As a consolation, they comped our drinks and gave us a free dessert. It was the least they could do. We will likely be back because it's convenient and, as I said, the food is consistent (when served immediately!!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=680,3.08,3.24,3.24,2.54,3.1760000000000006

I normally get the pizza which, even though I always get it, I don't think it's that great. Ate there last night and decided to try something different. BIG MISTAKE! I asked the waitress what else is good and she suggested the Jambalaya.  I did not really enjoy that dish at all. It had a monotonous taste and I was sick of eating it by the 2nd bite, but I do not like to waste food, especially food that costs me like $16 bucks so I just kept on chowing down on it. My friend ordered the garlic butter linguini pasta and her dish was worse than mine! I had a bite of her pasta and that was the most bland plain pasta I've ever eaten. Literally tastes like pasta tossed with some butter and some tomatoes sprinkled in. The chicken that topped it was good but pasta was soooooo incredibly bland. I literally took 1 small bite and would not eat anymore.  Good for us happy hour kicked in since it was 10pm. We ordered some buffalo wings and lucky for us they accidently sent us a full order instead of the half order your supposed to get for happy hr.  Service was great. We got a girl named Tera? and she was pretty awesome! We commend you on providing us with a great dining experience. Got myself a bday pizookie and I was in sweet, ice creamy, fatness heaven!

The manager's name is Cynthia.  She looked at the cockroach leg and said she guarantees there are no cockroaches and has never seen one in the kitchen.  The cockroach leg had joints and the little spiky hairs and was really gross. I can't believe she discredited the roach leg I fished out of my drink! She compensated my food, my drink and appetizer, but still charged me for both my daughter's drinks and food. They were both drinking cream soda too which I asked them to stop drinking. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

Last time I went, I invited my best friend for a quick drink and maybe some food if we felt like it. We were seated in a table for 4. I dont understand why they'd place us in a massive table in the middle of the floor when there were smaller ones around and empty small booths for two people. Anyway our first server, first server. . . , greeted us and was nice. She got our drinks out promptly. Then later brought another server explained to us that she had other things to do and that the woman next to her would be our new server. We looked at her and the woman just stood there with theeee most unfriendliest place..almost rolling her eyes..!!! Me and my friend were like omg did you just see that?! Anyway so this woman was our new server and said hi and walked away not asking us if we needed anything..which we did!! we were ready to order food. It took her, i timed it!! , 20 minutes to walk by..not to check on us..but walk by, when we caught her attention and was like yes?? i asked if i could order a pasta dish and she said yes. another 20 mins later she brings out my pasta scampi which was 1, burnt from the top..im talking about BLACK breadcrumbs and cheese soo burnt it was brown and all stuck together, fine. I let that slip by and totally peeled off the top burnt layer. When i started eating my food i noticed the ""angel hair"" pasta was all cut up!! Now if you know anything about pasta you know theyre long strands like spaghetti. This was mushy choppy 3 inch pieces of pasta! My friend and I were so surprised how awful it looked! Like throw up! I decided to just get a box to go and we decided to just leave. A bus boy had to ask us if we needed our check!! It was awful! Then another guy, idk who he was, dropped off our check. I mean seriously? We probably saw about 5 different people assisting us that night. No consistency. We also noticed they moved a family to a new table and started cleaning their table as if saying ""were closing soon..we gotta clear this section of the restaurant"" it was around 1045 pm. It was horrible! the people literally grabbed their plates and walked with them to another table near us! They didn't look too happy!!! When we finally left our paid check.

571,Danielle A.,"Denver, CO",224,82,3.0,2.0,2013-09-18,"Came into BJ's last night for a friends birthday dinner. Got there on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty so we were able to get a table right away. We were seated and a server came over right away to get our drink orders, also has another guy with her but doesnt introduce and say ""He is training"" or anything.  We got our drinks but were not asked if we wanted to try any of the beers or alcohol. No upselling here. We all ordered and received our food. We got stuffed mushrooms, moroccan chicken, and moroccan salmon, and a southwest salad. All of these items were from the 500 and under menu. Dont be fooled, it may be half the calories because it is certainly less than half the portion but for full prices. My chicken ended up coming out as salmon so I just ate it because although the restaurant was fairly empty, we waited about 30 minutes for our food. The salad was so pathetic and small, think about 2 cups of lettuce and a couple slices of avocado. The stuffed mushrooms (which is an appetizer) would not have been enough for the table, it was like a snack (think edamame). My couscous was cold and I was still hungry after my meal yet it came out to a whopping $13. I don't mind paying for good food but it was cold and the portions were actually upsetting.  It was my friends birthday so she got a pizzookie and we were amazed that the server said, ""we ran out of vanilla ice cream"", I mean did the pope run out of Bibles? Seriously! So we go a trio and had to get all chocolate, despite Baskin Robbins, neighborhood walmart, and Albertsons being in the same parking lot. When we got the dessert the ice cream was already almost melted and completely covering the cookie and the cookie was not warm. The chocolate ice cream was way to much. As we are about to take a bite of our dessert our neighboring table gets their dessert and.............. they got vanilla ice-cream. We told the waitress we really wanted vanilla and she said, ""yah I know, they just got it, sorry"". Okay? So we finished our dessert. The manager came over and said ""how was everything?"" and I said kind of a disappointment because we didnt have the dessert the way we normally like it he then said ""oh bummer, yah we just ran out of it"". Then he literally tossed 2 giftcards on the table and said ""these have anywhere between 5-500 dollars on it for your next visit"", well there were four of us at the table. So I proceeded to say, ""well for the inconvenience can we all get one? We did have luke warm meals and no ice-cream"" then he said something so ridiculous for a manager that I am offended.  He said, ""Well did you have separate checks?  I said, ""well we could but we wanted it to be easier for the server"", He said, ""WOW FEISTY"", then threw two more at the table and walked away. WALKED AWAY!!!!! I guess the manager is new and his name is Manny. I was so shocked that he had talked to me that way and that he had such an issue with giving us 2 extra cards. Especially because if we came back on 4 different instances with different or more friends wouldnt that end up being more money for this branch? Just saying.  The food here has really gone down and the service was terrible. I was appalled at the way we were spoken too and by a manager no less. Really disappointed with this location. I think we were really treated unfairly. It really wasnt so much the vanilla ice cream but more the service and quality of care and food we had received up until that point.

527,Ricardo G.,"West Covina, CA",31,25,,2.0,2013-09-19,"Love the food here at Bj's and it is definitely the only thing that keeps me coming. With that said, the service is usually pretty bad. The other night that I went was no different. I can't remember the name of the waitress that helped us but she is probably in her 40s-50s, white, and the past couple of times that we have been there she has served us in the bar late at night. The first time, I wanted to try a different beer so I asked her opinion about the Tatonka Stout, and she said that it was great, that she really loved it and that I should try it out.  So I took her advice and tried it out.  Now, I'm no newb to dark beers, but really, that beer was kinda gross.  Gross to the point where I only drank half and just left the rest.  But!  That is not the upsetting part because I wanted to try something new and I knew that there was a possibility that I would not like and that would absolutely not be the waitresses fault.  So the next time we go, we got put in her section again.  She asked what I would have and I said I would think about it because last time I tried the Tatonka Stout and it wasn't very good, and she replies ""oh yeah, the tatonka stout has a really weird taste, I wouldn't recommend it!""  So I just laughed to myself and I'm thinking - what a dick, you know? So I order some other drink, a raspberry type soda or something because I was thirsty as hell and I wanted something with refills.  So she brings it, and it is actually very good and as many times I asked for a refill she just wouldn't bring it.  I saw her come to the tables next to me and bring them refills and every time she came by me she said that she would be right back with my refill.  Haha it wasn't until we were literally about to walk out, we had already paid and everything that she finally brought me the refill, and again I'm left thinking - what a dick!  If it was a busy day I would be a little more sympathetic, but both times were during the week and the place was not packed like it gets on weekends.

Well that was the worst decision that we made. Our waiter Ramon comes over and greets us. Asks if we would like to start w our drinks, I ask what sodas do u carry and his reply ""Pepsi products"". I say hmmmm ok so thays Pepsi and uhhhh? I say this because I'm not an advit soda drinker more like water drinker. I felt his response was soooo wrong to a customer. Ramon rarely checked on our table, my aunt had to flag him down to get more hot water n lemon (she was sick). She finally just asked for a kettle of hot water this way we dont have to worry about Ramon ignoring our table.  It was sooooo sad because my aunt and I always base our decision for a tip and how great of a tip on the first 7-10 minutes of ther server catering to us. Ramon seemed more interested in his larger group tables, but lil did he know I am a great tipper bcus I understand their line of work.

Only round 2 took a little longer. No terrible yet but definitely lost that 5th Star. Again conversations continued and again lost track of time.    Then we noticed we were getting Really hungry and there was no food in sight, and neither was our waiter. We checked the time and as it turned out and hour and a half had elapsed, 4th Star lost. What's the deal? Where's the food?  Not only did I almost have to stand on the table  in order to wave down our waiter, 3rd Star lost, but when he finally decided to grace us with his presence he explained to us that he had ""forgotten to push the SEND button on our food order.""

If you read my previous review, you know I did not have the best of experiences. But I decided I wanted to go back today for lunch and try it out. As soon as I walked through the door, I was greeted with a cheerful ""Hello, welcome to BJ's"" by a smiling hostess (blonde, long pony-tail). We made small talk for a bit, and I asked if Emy, my amazing server from before, was working - and she was! I said I'd wait however long I needed to for her section, and was told there would be no wait at all. I was handed off to another girl who seats people, and she took me to my table, chatting with me on the way. I passed Emy on the way to my table and she greeted me with a big smile and said, ""Hello Mr. Olsen!"". Ok, now that is service. I was officially impressed. When she came over, she asked me how I was doing, and even remembered my order from last time, down to my drink. Again, clearly impressed. I ordered the lunch BBQ platter (pork slider and bbq chicken with wedge fries), and it was wonderful. Throughout the entire lunch, Emy checked in on me, and even remembered things we had talked about my last time in.  I decided to indulge and have the pizookie (pizza-cookie) - white macadamia nut. So delicious, I can't believe I have never tried this before! I realize I was quite harsh in my last review - and while I feel it was well deserved, I also believe when a company makes a conscientious effort to fix a situation, they deserve to be recognized.  I had a chance to meet with Cynthia, the manager I interacted with last time. We talked, and laughed, and she seemed genuinely interested in my experience at her restaurant today. Will I be back? Absolutely.

It's also in a huge lot by the Burlington's and stuff so take your pick!  We got in on monday evening and there was no wait. They also seated us before our entire party was there which made me sooooooooo happy. The population of looking like they've settled couples and high school children made the interior even more suburby which I again, love. Our waiter looked like he was a junior in high school and  was an attentive, try hard server.  I practiced some self control and ordered the chicken a la fresca without bell peppers and it was actually kind of delightful. Granted, I was absolutely starving but I finished the whole plate. The items on their menu are pretty horrible for you though so watch out, and I would try to stay with the healthier menu if possible. We were there for a bday so they brought out a mini pizookie for the bday boy, and we got our own, which was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS. Just for that pizookie they deserve 5 stars.

We get there just as they were opening, and I was starving.  The place has a gordon biersch type atmosphere, with a nice size bar section and an equal size dining area.  Our server Nicole was great, although my cousin knew exactly what she was getting.  Nicole helped me by recommending there deep dish pizza.  Let me just stop right here, after taking that first bite I had to say that this was the best pizza that I've ever had.  I consider myself a pizza guy and pretty much have had it all, but this was super delicious.  The bread was fluffy and not to doughy, the toppings were just right, even the bell peppers were chopped into little pieces, the italian sausage and pepperoni were right on spot.  Everything blended so well I was in heaven.  I was starving when I came in and even with all that I just described up top I could only finish half the pizza.   My cousin had the jambalaya which was her favorite.  I had a taste and the flavor was spot on.  Very spicy too much for me. I also on the recommendation from a friend had a beer from there brewery called Jeremiah's Red.  Was excellent and I couldn't even bring myself to try another beer. Finally if you come to BJ's for nothing else you need to order a Pizooki.  Now you may be wondering what that is.  Well firstly its a desert!  Next is where the awesome is.  Imagine a huge fresh baked cookie the size of a small pizza, made to order from about 3 different types of cookies you can even do half and half, and this is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Thats right LEGEN - wait for it - DARY!  Yup thats all that needs to be said it was epic and can't wait for another excuse to go to Cali and eat at BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=300,2.64,2.85,2.85,2.58,2.766

Our appetizers came out first. No drinks yet.  We then realized we had no utensils or napkins to eat with.    Kind of hard to eat Clam Chowder soup without a spoon.   We alert our waitress and it was another ten minutes before she came back,  with our drinks and utensils.   Our main entrées came out about fifteen minutes later.   Drink refills were non existent.  I only had water too.   My Ahi Tuna salad was a bit dry,  so I asked for more vinaigrette.   What was brought to me was some sort of olive oil mix.   It didn't even taste like the vinaigrette that was on the salad. Needless to say we were done with our meals fairly quick.   We ordered a meal off the kids menu to take home and a dessert.   I joked when we ordered it at the end of our meal that it would take half an hour to get to us.   Sure enough it did.   A manager came and did her rounds..

I had experienced mediocre service here before, but last week was out of control. After being seated, the ""waitress"" stopped by and said she would be right with us.  We were then visited by 4 different people helping with drinks, food orders, and serving. I had to seek out a completely different waitress to get a plate for my pizza and silverware because no body bothered to bring those out either. After about 30 minutes and consuming all of our beers, we thought we might order another glass, but no one ever came back to the table. We had to get up to ask the hostess to get a manager so we could even get our bill. After leaving my credit card with the bill the same ""waitress"" comes by to pick it up, after about an hour passed from her initial hello.  During the entire sitting, we saw the same ""waitress"" skip over our table and the neighbors next to us. The neighbors also complained and said they'd never be back. The manager tried swaying us with a couple pizookie coupons which offended me and made me even more disgusted with the place. Thanks so much for the coupons! That made everything SO much better! Me thinks not. I would have been much happier with a discount on the shitty service instead of trying to persuade me to come back which I have no intention of doing.

To make matters worse it took them a while to get our desert  as well, even though you will think they would at least get that to us in a timely manner. Very disappointed. Recommendation to the management: Your servers should be aware of their table better- they should able to tell that the food is delayed and fix the problem before it arouses- a manager should be walking between tables and checking if everything is on time- something acknowledging customer helps and prevent mistakes to happen and most important is a smile.

Somehow, he was overlooked.  Also the pizza for the 7 year old arrived about 15 minutes ahead of anyone else's meal. Luckily I had some crackers to occupy my toddler, otherwise we probably would have had to leave.  I will add that all food and drink drop-off were done by other servers, not our initial waiter.

Last night was my 33rd birthday, and I decided to have dinner here with my parent, my brother, my girlfriend, and her family. This was a Tuesday night at around 8pm. This isn't a busy night or time so I figured for a party of 8 this would work out quite well. I have been to this BJs countless times with my family and friends, so this led to my choice. Last night was the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant ever. Our party was sat and we waited upwards of 20 minutes. Then once our orders were taken the food took nearly 90 minutes before it was served. During that time our waiter came to the table twice. He was rushed, non-attentive, and overall a bad server. Finally the food came out, after two people in my party left because of the service, and most of the table wasn't even hungry any longer. Most of the table simply boxed the food. My brother, who also happens to be a food service employee, went to speak to the manager and explain the situation and received a cold and standard response that any automated life form might give. This was embarassing to me and my party.  Then the manager had the audacity to come to the table, after my girlfriend had paid the check, and said sorry and that he felt bad. He then offered a $25 gift card, which wasn't even 10% of the check. It was obvious by his tone and his general demeanor that he could careless.  I wanted to thank BJ's for ruining my 33rd birthday and wasting my girlfriend's money. I will never go to this BJ's again, eventhough it is less than a mile away from my house.

We ordered an appetizer, which came out promptly, however we were not given any plates. We waited and finally our server walked by and I asked for plates. About 10 minutes later we asked a different server walking by if we could have plates. We had to ask a 3rd server if we were expected to eat off the tables or would it be too much to get plates. The appetizer was cold by the time we got plates.  We ordered the house Blonde beer. After ordering a 2nd beer, the server brought a different kind saying they were out of the blonde. We asked for a bottled beer instead and he brought out something we didn't order, saying they were changing all beers. A gentleman in a blue shirt, appeared to be a manager, walked by and checked to see how things were. We explained that the service was very slow and we were waiting for awhile for our drinks. He said he would check and let us know but he did not return. Our server (Christopher) eventually returned with the bottled beer that we ordered. Christopher never asked if we wanted a glass, so my friend asked for one. He returned with the cold glass about 15 minutes later.  The food was good (even the cold appetizer) but service is bad.

I continue to tell him the points are for the PIZOOKIE and the beignet is just being added to the bill AND HE STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND! I have never had a problem using my points before until I met JULIO! Even after all that we still only ended up with the the baked beignet and it was just DISGUSTING!

Last night I went with a party of 6 we went and sat in the bar area because it didn't seem too crowded. We started out with one waiter who was attentive and got our orders quickly, drinks served quickly, it was going pretty good! He came up to us about 15 minutes in and said since it was a slow they were sending him home. No problem, waiters get switched all the time for no reason. Our new waitress came to our table about 2 times and after 40 minutes of waiting with out receiving our food I finally asked. If our original waiter got sent home early for it being slow, it shouldn't have taken so long for our food. Our food ended up coming out right after I asked, but 3 of the 6 orders were messed up. It was really disappointing. Normally BJs service is great! Last night was just a let down. Not sure we will be back to that location.

So after that we order our food, and I got the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My order did not meet my expectations, as it was very bland, especially the pineapple fried rice that came with it. Very little rice, and generally flavorless except for the pineapple bits. The fish was bland as well. I think it's pretty funny how they gave a teensy bit of sriracha sauce on the side. It seemed like they were attempting a design but it ended up looking like a mess.

Some of the people at my office wanted to throw a baby shower for one of our coworkers.  Since our conference room at the office was under renovation, we needed to find another venue to have the lunch.  Since we work near several restaurants, we decided to see if we can have it at one of them. We went to BJs and spoke to the general manager, Will a week prior to the event.  We explained to him what we were planning and asked him if they would be able to accommodate that.  We also explained to him that this was a work event and asked if we would be able to get split bills to make it easier for everyone.  Since they no longer automatically added tip to large parties, it really wouldn't make a difference.  He assured me that it was no problem and recommended that we pre-order everyone's food so that they would already know the name of the person, their food order, their drink order, and any special food requests they had ahead of time.  I thought this was a brilliant idea and agreed that this would make the process smooth and efficient.  He was really friendly and we felt at ease after speaking with him. We had 25 people RSVP to the shower and so we typed out everyone's orders and made sure to personally bring the print out to BJ's just in case they had any questions. Our party was scheduled for Thursday @ 11:30am and we brought the print out to BJs on Wednesday.  We asked for Will and gave him the print out to look over and see if the info we had was sufficient for what they needed.  He had a couple questions that were easily remedied and we were set to go.  He even complimented the fact that we had all info so organized and easy to follow. He indicated that they would have the food ready to go that day and we wouldn't have to waste time trying to order and they would have the checks all ready to go with each person's order and name on it so it would be easy on them and on us when it came time to pay the bill.  He even said he would be there the day of our event. The food and wait staff were all decent and we all got our orders in a timely manner.  However, when it came time for the bill.  The waitress said she didn't know anything about the split checks and that it would take time for them to do it.  We even spoke with the assistant manager, Cynthia that day and she was aware of the printout I had given Will.  She even commented that it was so well organized.  We asked to speak with her and instead of apologizing for not having the bills ready as promised by Will.  She said it was a hassle to do split checks and that their computer systems can't handle it and that's why it'll take longer. We asked if we could speak with Will since he was the one we had been dealing with and was informed by one employee that he wasn't working and that he was in the kitchen by another employee. We ended up waiting a good 30min for the bill and most of our party ended up leaving since we were all there during our lunch break and it was already well past our lunch.  The rest of the people that stayed had to deal with everyone's checks.  They also ended up charging some people incorrectly and were billed ""dinner"" prices when we all ordered lunch portions. It was past 2pm by the time we finished paying everyone's bills.  We had been looking forward to a relaxing lunch and instead, we left irritated and angry.  I was especially irritated because we were the ones going around getting everyone's orders the day before and making sure everything was as complete as possible.   We have a large office and many of us order food from BJs.  After this experience, I don't think I will ever go again.  I had always been really happy with the food from BJs, but after this, even the food can't win back my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=160,2.92,2.66,3.04,2.244,2.7640000000000002

We arrived about 15 mins later and only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated. This BJ's is pretty busy on a Sunday night. Our server was so friendly and managed to keep his composure with it being so busy. He did a really great job. My only complaint was that my order was a tad wrong. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and received the Buffalo Chicken pizza. No biggie. Also, their beer is so good. My friend wanted to order a Snakebite with the berry blast instead of Pear. Our waiter said no problem and made the switch. Turned out to be the best fruity beer ever haha I tried the Magic Hat #9. Really great light and flavorful beer. Besides that, I do want to make mention that the table next to us was so rude to the staff here and made a huge  ordeal about nothing. After the customers being there for about 15 mins, complained to the manager about how they had been there for a half hour and that the service was horrible. Pretty much telling the manager they wont be coming back anymore because they have had to wait a long time the last time they were there. The manager apologized plus totally took care of their meals and drinks. I have to say that these customers were so rude that after the manager told them it would be free, they had the audacity to order a free dessert as well. My friend and I assumed that those customers wouldn't leave a tip so we tipped for them and left a note to the server saying good luck and that he had been doing a great job :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=600,3.0,2.67,3.044,2.6399999999999997,2.8020000000000005

I had to call her over to fill my drink, she than filled mine and left my Moms below ice level. I noticed our neighbors at the table closeby getting much better service for obvious reasons, they were a larger party. Our order finally arrives and the chicken in my tacos was stale (hard as a rock) and appeared to have been sitting over night. I than asked for a manager and got Will the GM. He said a lot of nice things and apologizes and turned us over to a new server. After another 10 mins I get a new plate. After eating we requested our check from John our new server who  than disappeared. We had no choice but to revert back to the original waitress who delivered the check. It included the stale chicken plate. I than asked for a business card some other guy who was another manager and Will both showed up and Will said our meal was paid for (my cc was already ran I'll update if I get a credit so far nada).

We were seated around 6:45pm, took us a while to order then finally did. It was my friends 21st birthday so we wanted that evening to be special. So we ordered a little bit before 7, food and drinks, and we didn't get our food until 7:45pm. Then I didn't get my martini until 8pm.  Instead of having a special night for my friends birthday it ended up a night were we had to look for our waitress and continue to wait for everything that we ordered.  To top it off I gave the waitress my reward number and yet I didn't get any points for that evening.

The food was great but the one little issue was a broken plate ... It's an obvious the kitchen manager isn't doing his job correctly and his staff doesn't give a ?hit. That plate had to switched through more then one person and nobody noticed a broken place if I was the manger I would have a sit down with the staff and put them in check. There's no reason for this to happen. The kid that picked up the plate after when I was done with it noticed it and I told him let your manager know .. He didn't I walked up to the manger on my way out and showed him a picture I took of the plate he seemed shocked that this plate made it this far.

They are also known for their pizza.  The pizza dough is soft yet the edges has some crisp to them.  It's not like a hard crust on the edge, so you can definitely eat it even those who usually don't eat the crust.  The pizza is not greasy.  Their flatbread and thin crusts are also very good.  I've never had the deep dish as I think the regular pizza has enough dough.  My family's fave is the classic combo hand-tossed pizza.  It's almost a meat lovers with mushrooms.  They definitely have an extensive pizza menu. I've never tried their steak or seafood but my family says they like the food in general.  They have a big bar area, lots of TVs and a big space.  Definitely great for watching sports and celebrating birthdays, etc. I can see why the service can be deemed inconsistent as not all servers are alike.  Luckily, the times I've been here, the servers I've had were great: friendly, attentive, knew the menu.  There was no wait the last time we went for Christmas Eve, but other times there is a long wait esp during the summer and game nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=220,2.36,2.69,2.924,2.576,2.558

I ordered a ribeye medium rare.  In parts, it was medium, other parts were medium well, and it was dry.  It also could use a bit of salt, but a guy with a tray had taken all the salts and peppers off all the tables right after we sat down.  We asked our waitress for the salt, but it never showed up, so I ate my steak as it was.  My husband had the angel hair pasta with blackened chicken, and he liked it.  I tried it, and found it very bland overall, but I also bit into a large chunk of something very crunchy (no idea what it was) that had a very unpleasant taste. My daughter ordered the kid's 6"" deep dish cheese pizza.  She refused to eat it when it came out, but I made her take a couple of bites.  She said it wasn't pizza, and I must say I agree.  It wasn't deep dish pizza either.  It was just puffy cheesy bread with a tiny bit of sauce on it.  Our waitress did bring by a box for the pizza without us requesting it, trying to be helpful, saying that she was sure our daughter would want to take it home.  We told her our daughter didn't like it, refused to eat it even, but our waitress did nothing about it, just dropped off the check that she'd brought with the box.  So we just ended up paying $5.25 for it anyway and left the whole pizza behind.  Very disappointed with the level of service AND the food.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=680,2.56,2.78,2.92,2.18,2.692

127,Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717.0,4.0,2015-01-18,"Came by this BJ's last Thursday around 11:40 pm to pick up a to go order. For it being a weekday, this place was pretty busy. The size of this restaurant location is bigger than the other BJ's around the area (Arcadia, City of Industry, Montebello). When I came to pick up my order, my food was just about ready for me to pick up (I made the order on line). This is what I ordered: Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I have had this salad a few times already at other locations and am a big fan of it. Can't go wrong with the flavors and textures in this salad. The dried cranberries add a different texture and sweetness to this salad, along with the red grapes. The candied pecans and toasted pepitas give this salad another layer of flavor and crunch. The cooked Brussels sprouts also help to create another layer of texture to this salad and the kale is a nice dark green leafy to round out this hearty salad. It's nice that the dressing automatically comes on the side so that your salad doesn't get soggy before you arrive (this is also healthier so you don't over do the dressing in your salad).  Asian Chopped Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I liked this salad with the mandarin oranges adding a bit of sweetness. I wished this salad was made with the dark green leafys though. There is plenty of chicken in this salad, but perhaps a bit too much of the crispy wonton strips. I would probably ask them to give me half the amount they use if I was to order this again.  Full Rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs, $21.95 prior to tax- This entree comes with 2 signature sides and so I picked the steamed green beans & seasoned vegetables. Both were cooked well and tasted great. But the ribs itself was a little dry. Although I got a little container of barbecue sauce, which was a nice flavor, it still wasn't a saving grace to those ribs. What a shame, especially at this price point. Sweet Pig Deep Dish Pizza, Large 14 inch ($20.05 prior to tax)- My husband and I were a little disappointed with this pizza because it was just too bread-y (if that can even be a word...). I wished the bread/ dough itself was seasoned because it was rather plain. The pizza itself was also on the salty side (but that's understandable since this pizza has ham and cheese). I thought BJ's is know for their pizzas (besides their beers) and so I was surprised that this pizza was a let down. I don't think I would order this or a pizza again in the future.  Service was very friendly when we arrived and picked up our pizza. The two employees helping us moved quick and efficiently.  By the way, this restaurant location is located in the same plaza as Walmart (neighborhood market), DSW and Petsmart.

We stood there for about 5 minutes looking around for someone to help us making eye contact multiple times with a man sitting at one of the tables in the bar who later turned out the be a host. He left the table, approached us and told us to take a seat anywhere in the bar, and went back to his table. No welcome or any sign of being a host. So we pick a table near other people so we would be noticed right away. Another 10 minutes pass and we're sitting at our table waiting for someone to check on us for drinks and to give us menus.

The hostess was polite but for some reason would not look at me in the eye and insisted on speaking with my sister even though I was doing the talking. I don't know what that was about. Maybe she thought we were a couple & didn't want my sister to think she was flirting with me? I don't know but in any case it was not professional and made my sister & I uncomfortable. Our waitress's name was Marlena she was slow and lacked any sense of urgency, professionalism or service. I saw her chit-chatting with fellow employees and other patrons before, during and after our meal while disregarding my table and her other tables. I had to get her attention twice while she was wasting time and chatting with a man at another table and showing him pictures of her children on her phone. When I finally got her attention she seemed annoyed & brought us a refill of the wrong beverage. Anyway I'm usually a big tipper & feel bad when I leave without tipping even if the service was subpar. This time I gladly left 0 tip with no regret! It will be a very long time before I even consider giving this place another chance.

We visited on a busy Saturday night and were informed there was a 30 minute wait. We didn't mind waiting but when we were seated we noticed how many empty tables there were, which made us wonder why they had us waiting outside for so long. Maybe there weren't enough waiters available to serve all the tables but I would expect a popular place like BJ's to be fully staffed on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very nice and attentive when taking our orders and checked up on us frequently. However, the food took nearly an hour to come out after we placed our orders. We felt bad asking our waitress where our food was because she seemed SO busy running from table to table. I ordered the new honey-Sriracha brussel sprouts, a burger, and fries. My friends ordered a pizza and a pazookie.  When the food  finally arrived at our table, it was just alright. I struggled to find another adjective to describe the food but really that is the best way to sum up both the food and our entire experience at BJ's that night: Alright. The brussel sprouts were too salty and overcooked. The burger & fries were meh. The pizza seemed like it had been sitting out a little longer than it should have been. The one thing that was delicious was, of course, the pazookie because pizza-size cookies with ice cream on top are one of the greatest inventions in the modern-day world.  Yum.

He gave us menus but in the meantime another gentlemen who had been very busy came over to help us. My mother ordered a goose island and I got BJs peach beer.

This place is so good that you'll even catch their employees staying after their shifts to enjoy a nice meal or a cold drink by the bar. Parking: This location is placed in a shopping center so theres plenty of free parking nearby.  Service: Excellent! Good customer service skills.

We had just gotten back from a long day at the beach so we were hungry! My boyfriend and I got their calamari, artichoke spinach dip, clam chowder soup in the bread bowl, a mini deep dish Mediterranean pizza w/jalapeños and pineapples. The calamari was just what I was expecting (calamari and not fried onions or leftover fried pieces), the dip tasted freshly made (went great with the freshly made tortilla chips), biggest bread bowl of soup i've ever seen (it also stayed hot the whole time we were there) and the mini deep dish pizza was only $6 for unlimited toppings!

Now I have always enjoyed my food i.e. the taste and the appearance of it, but inevitably something was wrong with my order.  This is the second time I have ordered something that was not quite right.  The first time a couple months ago I ordered a mango salad, it came it looked nice and as I ate it, I realized something was not quite right...bingo!!!, no mango! what? they forgot to put in the mango, told  my waiter, he handled it and the actual manager delivered a new salad properly made and apologized. Ok fine, that was that.  Well, today I ordered the mahi tacos, as usual looked good, but such a miniscule amount of mahi I could hardly find it in there, (and I know that's what I'm paying for). I brought it to the waiters attention, and of course they gave me a whole new order with still such a teeny tiny bit of mahi inside, I believe that is just the way they serve them because I checked my 2nd one from the 2nd order and it was just a bit there too. Anyway, I'm saying this to say I wouldn't order that if you're looking for mahi, because the taco consisted mainly of the fish taco slaw/salad which was quite tasty, but the fish is the star of the show if you ask me.  All in all, I'll probably go back there and get my usual pizza and as long as they keep giving me a second order every time they mess up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=520,2.24,2.86,2.736,2.668,2.612

My family and I arrived at BJ's right before the dinner rush walked in, at 6:40pm, and waited 15 minutes or less to get seated.  A few minutes later, our waitress came to get our drink orders. We told her we were ready to order: 1 small bbq chicken pizza, 1 side Caesar salad, 1 beer, 1 root beer, and waters. Our drinks came right away. While waiting for our food, my husband began feeding our 1 year old daughter. Not too long after, the family sitting in the booth adjacent to us (who got there after us) got their appetizers. And then so did the booth on the other side of us.  My husband had to ask the waitress for his salad. It arrived after that, but it was the size of an entree and hardly had any dressing. He could barely eat it because it was so dry.   By 7:20, the same family who go their appetizers had moved on to their entrees and here we were sitting with a dry salad and all out of baby food. The place was packed and people who weren't even there when we arrived were eating. The whole time our waitress kept checking up on our table and telling us the food would be out shortly. Well...after 35 minutes of waiting, my husband stood up and spoke to a manager and told her our situation. Of course, the pizza came while my husband was with the supervisor.  I told the waitress I didn't want the pizza anymore and also complained about the salad. Instead of apologizing, she told me she saw my husband was speaking with her supervisor so she would leave the pizza here for now. Also, that she heard my husband order a Caesar entree, not a side salad. The only apology we got from our waitress was after the manager had stepped in. The manager comped our meal and we took it home. We were out the door around 7:40pm (1 hour after arrival) angry and hungry. How good or bad your experience here goes really depends on your server.

So today being Saturday I knew it was going to be busy so I decided to do the take-out service BJ's has. I ordered a large pizza so when I got to the take-out area to pay I used my credit card, but my card has been having issues so it was not swiping properly. I ask the girl who was helping me out if she could type it in manually instead of continuously swiping so she asked this chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if she can do that, he abruptly answered ""if it doesn't swipe it doesn't work"" in a pretty rude manner. I then took out my second card and was having the same issue so I told them ""why don't you use the receipt paper and then slide it"" and wa lah after 20 attempts it worked, I wanted to tell them ""if they put in a little effort you might have a successful outcome"" but I just kept my mouth shut. I wait, get my pizza and when she hands it to me the bottom of the box has melted cheese and also on the top, I just wanted to get out of there so I asked the same chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if I can get a bag for my pizza and he then replied with ""No we don't have bags for that!"" I then got a little ticked off and told them ""well can you guys at least clean the box!"" They did so but when I got home to eat the pizza it seemed as if Stevie wonder cut it himself and passed the cooked pizza to Ray Charles to box it up.

222,Abhie C.,"Covina, CA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-05-20,"My first and mostlikely my last visit in this restaurant. Friday night we went there and we were on the waiting list, had to wait for 25 mins. No biggie for us, we waited until we were seated.  Seated, ordered a pasta entree and my husband ordered a burger with thin sliced fries on the side.  Drinks came in right after.  Ten minutes later the waitress just kept checking up if we doing fine. Typical but we appreciate this gesture.  Twenty minutes later, same thing, but this time she's trying to assure us that the food is coming soon.  Thirty minutes and still no food.  Forty minutes later, no food still.  Pushing to fifty minutes to maybe an hour, this time we are already getting upset. The nearby tables are almost gone and empty, and yet we still have no food. We had to call a nearby waiter to ask what happened to our food. He went ahead and also called a manager in our table.  All this times, I guarantee you, we were calm. A little bit upset but we were okay. We just want the damn food to come. Now the manager came and approached us, he apologized and offered a free dessert and a discount for the inconvenience. And we were ok we that, we appreciate the gesture. Soon after talking to him, our food came. But unfortunately, they got my husband's order wrong. They gave him wedge fries that looked horribly over fried, what he ordered were thin slices fry. How frustrating, now the manager again approached us and asked if everything is okay. And i said, that the order was wrong. He apologized and then went off to get us the right one.  To be fair though, my husband said that the burger actually tasted good. My pasta, not so much unfortunately :( Now at this point we were done eating and kindly asked for the ""complimentary"" dessert, it came fast and it was really delicious. We werent even done eating it, and the bill was already given to us. Funny how fast they gave the bill but they took an hour to get us our food. Checking the bill and all that, we noticed that they were charging us of the supposedly ""free"" (apology dessert), we then had to call the manager, yet again, for the 4th or 5th time to correct it. As you can already imagine, this is probably the one of the worst experience one can encounter. It was just a disaster.

166,Danielle S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4,58,28.0,4.0,2016-05-21,"I apologize for the extremely long review in advance!  But something has to be said.  My boyfriend and I came to dinner tonight at the BJs at the Eastland center.  The restaurant was packed which is to be expected for a Friday night.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive even though he was extremely busy running around everywhere.  The reason I took off a star is because when the server (different from our waiter) brought us our food she had a hard time fitting my bfs plate on the table because his appetizer was in the way (he ordered potato skins and they come on a really long plate; also we were sitting at a small booth for two). She finally made it work and when she walked away she made an extremely rude and insensitive comment.  At first we kind of brushed the comment off and tried to enjoy our food. Then, the more time passed and the more we thought about it, the more it upset us. We chose to go to BJs over 3 Vinos for dinner, and had every intention of enjoying a nice dinner after a long week. We make that choice just to have our night ruined by a rude server.  Eventually we asked to speak to the manager.  At first the assistant manager came to our table and when we told him what happened he went to get his supervisor. A few minutes later the restaurant manager came to our table and apologized for the incident, let us know our meal was ""taken care of"" and encouraged us to call him directly if we had any other concerns.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the way the manager Louis handled the situation. He apologized so many times and did so much for us that I even started to feel bad for saying anything.  We had ordered dessert to go (we  pizookies!) and boxed up over half of our entrees and both of our appetizers because we lost our appetites. Louis comped our entire meal including the to-go desserts, AND brought us dessert to enjoy before we left.  While we were waiting for our to-go desserts the server and executive chef came to our table to apologize for the comment.  This was going to be our last time at this BJs but after being taken care of so well by Louis I will make sure we return.  Neither of us expected the sincerity we received from Louis, the server, and the executive chef OR for anything (let alone our entire meal) to be on the house. We really just wanted to bring it to their attention and from the way Louis reacted it seemed as thought this was not the first time this server had an incident like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=180,2.24,2.78,2.744,2.48,2.564

Empty glasses and empty appetizer plates were left at our table for 45 minutes. Multiple servers and runners came to our table to drop food off but not one bothered to pick up a single dish. We ended up just moving the empties over to the empty space on the table connected to ours. (Picture included) 3. A bug in one of the drinks and the server said ""oh you don't like floaties?"" No sorrys or apologies, just said to move it over to the empty space next to our table and he brought out another.  4. We ordered 3 pizzas for our table. One came out warm. One semi warm and one completely wrong. Our pizza came out with olives and chicken, both of which were not ordered. It felt as if the waiter was confused as to why we would be complaining about getting extra toppings, not even considering that my girlfriend is allergic to olives.  5. We sent the pizza back to be remade since there was no way for my girlfriend to eat it.

He had trouble getting down orders and even the simplest request. His presence was very hallow since he seemed completely disinterested in helping us in away.  Anytime we asked or question something regarding our order he would say rudely, ""wait. Give me a minute."" Or ""can you let me finish this first?""  Clearly he wasn't ready or trained well enough to handle 15/20 people and when it came to delivering the birthday boy's Pazookie, Frank simply slammed it in front of him and we had no idea he had even brought it until after we saw that it was hiding somewhere in the center of the table. We sang happy birthday and asked for pictures and his response was, ""eh, I don't know. Wait. Hold on.""  At which point we didn't care to ask for anymore help knowing that he really didn't want to help us and he clearly had somewhere else better to be.  He made the dinner feel like nothing special and treated us as if we were last table of the night and we were keeping him from going home.

She has bright red hair and had her hair 1/2 up 1/2 down (hope no one gets red hair in there food). She was very rude to my girlfriend. She asked for water with lemon and Brittany  rolled her eyes at her. She did end up ordering a mimosa later. But because we sat in the bar and didn't order drinks right away Brittany looked mad. We ordered  avocado egg rolls. They are amazing the young Mexican man that dropped it off was very nice and even smiled. (The first one we saw all day) Brittany never came by to see how we were doing. We had to ask another server to get her so we could order. She came up to us still seemed like she was mad and didn't want to be at work. We ordered a large bj favorite. The pizza was good. We then saw Brittany walk by and heard her talking to another server about someone very rude to do that with guest all around that can hear her. She had time to walk around and no time to get us a refill or ask if we needed anything. She finally came by and I asked if I could talk to a manager. She never got one because they never came. So if I come back I will make sure I don't have her. 3 stars for food 1 for Brittany. If you don't want to work don't have a job and I'm sure talking about people isn't allowed at work. I hope whoever she was talking about doesn't find out because nothing was nice.

I should have known it was going to be interesting when our server had to keep asking what we ordered. He had a notepad in his hand but never wrote anything down. We ordered an appetizer and requested it to come out first. My girlfriend ordered a sandwich that came with a soup. I ordered a small pizza. I also ordered a house beer. After some conversation, my girlfriends soup came to the table. We mentioned to the server (who was different than the one who took our order) that we had ordered an appetizer. He said it was on the way. Finally our appetizer was ready. Next came my pizza. After eating a slice or 2, I completely forgot about my beer that never came. It had been at least 15 minutes at this point. I searched around for our server and couldn't locate him. I even pondered walking to the bar and ordering it myself (which would have been faster). Eventually our server brought my beer. Moments later, one of the managers came to our table to notify us that my girlfriends order had been given to another table, they were re-making her order, and offered to take the appetizer off the bill. We accepted and appreciated the heads up, though it was a big inconvenience as I was almost done with my meal. Our server brought out my girlfriends meal and she immediately noticed it was made wrong. She took a bite then realized it wasn't what she ordered. We waved down the server and he looked at it and even he said it wasn't correct. After finally a third attempt, they brought out the correct order but my girlfriend had already lost her appetite and I was disappointed at the terrible service. I asked to speak to the manager. We spoke to another manager, Luis (or Louis) and explained to him our terrible experience. He did the right thing and offered to cover our entire meal, except for the $4 beer (the one that took 15-20 mins). Well, we ended up leaving them $5 and probably won't be returning to this location.

I went on a Thursday of course. Since these specials started, I've been to BJ's 3 times for the Thu special. It's a REALLY good deal because regularly, the 1/2 rack is about $18 and you don't get that extra salad or pizookie so it's a REALLY good idea to take advantage and the ribs are so omaagghh delicious.  I also like their BJ's favorite pizza - you really can't go wrong with that. I'm also a big fan of wings and I've ordered their bone-in wings each time I came for the rib special as an app and after 3 times (I was in doubt I guess), I can say that I don't think I really like them.

Hahaha.  Tonight, Mr GM decided to take me here for dinner on date night.  Was he trying to send me a message deciding on this establishment?  Well rest assure, it was definitely lost in translation! Hahaha It was such a busy Tuesday night on Thanksgiving week.  Needless to say,  it was super loud and very difficult to hear each other.  Then I thought,  he did this on purpose so he could sit hip to hip with me in our booth.   Which we did.  Besides, there was no way to hear each other had we stayed across from one another.  And yes, I know it's a bar with multiple flat screens...as with any other BJs, like the one I frequent at City of industry merely for drinks. Anyway, on to the review... The BAD- Not date-friendly atmosphere. Great with if I was with friends who wouldn't mind almost screaming to have a conversation..  the aesthetics were just horrible! Service, although courteous, was extremely slow AF!   Slow to get our drink and food orders.  About 30 minutes.  That's just to order.  There were more irritating delays- I ordered a glass of Cab.  He originally ordered a Moscow mule, although not on the menu,  our server said they will do it for him.  Only to return 20 minutes later to say they ran out of ginger beer.  So he decided on piña cold which he couldn't even drink because the sweetness took over the entire drink.  I honestly thought it was a virgin drink.  So then he decided on a glass of Merlot.  Took another 30 minutes for that.  SmH.  The GOOD- We ordered and shared, their seasoned rare tuna salad and spinach artichoke dip.  The seasoned, seared rare ahi tuna came fully dressed with greens and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette, served with avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, wasabi for a kick, and strips of wonton  and scallions.   3/5 stars. Their spinach and artichoke dip bumped this review to a solid 3 stars! It was absolutely delish IMO.  Rich and creamy with good chunks of artichokes and spinach with the right amount of flavoring & consistency,  topped with parmesean cheese made for a great dip with tortilla chips! 5/5 stars! I'd definitely return for this dip alone!!!

The manager named ""Louis"" was courteous and very accommodating. He apologized to us for the long delay as they were very busy, especially on a Saturday afternoon, and that they do their best to help make our food perfect. Needless to say, very classy of him to do that for us. If this happened in your typical Asian restaurants, an initiation of apology or any kind of conversations are very less likely to happen. He brought me a ketchup and barbeque sauce at the same time. Good service on their end. Food: My steak was perfect as promised. Medium-rare and sizzling, man it was tasty. My two sides were mashed potatoes and seasonal fries, bomb. We ordered the pizookie after and that came out kinda quick! It was yummy. My favorite part of many feasting meals are probably the desserts haha. When we got the bill, we gave them a 100 and waited for our change.

We chose to come to the West Covina BJ's as it was one of very few places that were going to be open at dinner time on December 24th that would have a suitable selection for my boyfriend (he's a vegetarian).  The moment we walked in, the smell that accosted us was horrific. It reeked of urine - almost as if someone had peed all over the rugs in the entryway, someone peed at the door, the floors were mopped with a dirty mop from the bathroom... I don't know - but it was strong and I almost wanted to leave based solely on that. But we stood by the desk waiting for the hostess to not only help us but acknowledge us (it took about 2 minutes for her to even look in our direction - no exaggeration on the time).  Our waiter was very good and attentive - I wish I'd have gotten his name because he was the only positive part of the evening. The BF ordered a custom pizza and I ordered the ribeye. The plate and subsequent replacement plates were filthy - fingerprints, grease, caked on food - the waiter was genuinely embarrassed about this. And no, the cutlery didn't fair much better as the BF needed a replacement set on those, too.  When the food finally arrived after what I'd consider a longer than normal wait time, especially based on what we ordered, it looked pretty good. My BF remarked that the pizza was very tasty and well made. My steak however left quite a lot to be desired: I ordered it at mid-rare and it bordered more on rare but that wasn't much of an issue for me. What I DID take issue with was the amount of un-rendered fat left on the steak and the gristle. For a ""prime"" cut of meat, I was very surprised and not in the good way. I cut it in half and was able to get a couple of bites in - it tasted okay, it was just very bland and underwhelming - but as I tried to cut my third bite, I hit some gristle and I hacked and sawed trying to cut around it and mauled at a good portion of the steak before conceding (and never managing to get my knife through it). I hate, HATE to send food back but for a dish at a premium price that I couldn't enjoy, I decided it needed to go back. I ordered a pizza in its place and after a considerable wait period again, it arrived and was decent. The manager checked in on us and again, the waiter was very good to us. I ate a little less than 2 pieces of the pizza before asking for boxes since my BF was long done. We'd been at the restaurant for about 2 hours at that point and were 100% ready to leave.  We will never be back to this location. Ever. We will drive further if we ever consider BJ's again and that's a big ""if."" This place needs its manager to get a fire under her ass about quality and maybe have the health department come in to check the cleanliness.

We flagged her down 50 minutes later to check on our food and asked us what our order was and then comes back out and tells us it was her fault she never put our order in. Then asks us if we want to wait another 20 minutes for our food? What question is that to a guest who has already been waiting. She wasn't genuine on her apology and seemed to use the business as an excuse for her mistake. If it is too busy and you can't keep up then ask your co workers for help or where is your manager supporting you if you're still training? I am a general manager in a restaurant and you own up to your mistakes. The manager she brought over to us simply just said she had no excuses for our wait and what happened and I even told her she should ensure she is staffed properly to keep up with their business unless you want to continue having these experiences with other people she gave us a 25 dollar gift card not comping the meal we used it to pay for our bill.

After waiting for a table for 2, we were finally seated and had to wait another 20 minutes before a waitress finally noticed us and took our drink orders. We watched people seated after us be helped first. She was nice and the meal was good but then after she brought us the check she was nowhere to be seen again. We had already been at the restaurant for a good two hours and just wanted to get out of there. Eventually we went up to the front wondering if maybe we were supposed to pay our bill there and the hostess just told us we have to go back to our table and pay with our server. We told her we'd been sitting there forever and couldn't find her and the hostess just said sorry. We went back to our table and sat there some more, clearly irritated, before a bus boy finally noticed and went to swipe our card real fast. We could have very easily just walked out without paying since no one was even paying attention to us. Don't leave customers waiting to pay the bill for over 30 minutes.

284,Martina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-01-05,"Came to BJ's to have our usual BJ's specialty pizza and their delicious beginners appetizer, this was our first time at this particular location in West Covina, hate to say that it was a very disappointing dinner and visit. The mozzarella sticks, boneless wings, and pizza where cold when they brought it to our table! We told the gentleman who brought us our food that the sticks where cold and he graciously brought a new order of cheese sticks which we where grateful for however, even then the cheese sticks where not warm enough to where the cheese was melted. Solid cheese is not what is expected in a mozzarella cheese sticks order. We also then realized our wings where just as cold and mentioned it to our waiter for the second time. Discarding the cheese sticks we then told him we didn't want a new order, we just would like him to take them and re-heat them. Of course he did but. Sad to say when he brought them back 4 minutes later they still weren't hot enough. We then just decided to ask for a box and take the remaining pieces home and just heat it and home and call it a day. We didn't make a big deal over it, it was obvious we weren't getting anywhere after waiting 45 min to get seated and having to take our food back two time we just were not in the mood. So we sucked it up and just left.

And we always order a nutty brunette house beer. It was flat. I told the waitress that the beer was flat and she said that the brew master  had said that it was fine and that they don't know where we usually go and that they are the only ones that brew their own beer. Well I think if a customer is complaining that the beer is flat, it is obiously flat. San Bernardino, Moreno Valley and victor villes bj's has been the best bj'S so far, in my opinion.

Typically there was nothing special about the place, but also nothing really to complain about, so I never bothered to leave a review until now. My mom and I were a bit hungry, so we went to eat lunch at BJ's around 3/4. There weren't very many people at the time, aside from the bar area that held it's usual beer-drinking football-watchers. There was the occasional loud cheer or angry grumble, but my mother and I didn't care too much. Even though the dining areas were close to empty, we were asked to wait about five to ten minutes. We weren't in a hurry, so we didn't care too much about this either. When they did come to seat us, they placed us in the back of the restaurant, far from the football watchers, which was considerate. But didn't really do much to lower the volume of their cheers with us still being in the same large room. We sat down, and I was quick to notice two other families in the same area. One which were nearing the end of their meal, and the other had recently sat down as well, but had drinks in front of them. We were informed that a waiter would be with us shortly, and low and behold- no one came. 5 minutes passed, then 10, then 15. Multiple times we tried to flag down a waiter, only to either go unnoticed or ignored. The only employee who seemed to walk by our section was a busboy who seemed very intent on cleaning the same ""recently vacated"" table. We tried to flag him down as well, but to no avail. In the end, about 15 minutes had passed with no one coming by to even ask us for our drink orders. My mother and I decided we didn't need to waste our time there anymore.

The last two times I was here I ordered a pizza with extra cheese. Each time there was bald spots on my pizza. Maybe each time they got extra confused with light? It made me feel as if there was a cheese shortage right now? Another recession? I'm also not impressed when the waiter takes your order and not writing it down!!!! It's annoying to me!

The entire time we just kept hearing the girl employees gossip and talk about their nails and the males asking each other ""How'd 32 tip you?"" Very unprofessional. The hostess also walked around while texting on her phone and servers were fooling around a good amount of the time.  As for the food I was also not impressed. The portobello mushroom salad we got looked like there was little to no effort put into making it. The goat cheese was not spread out at all, they just threw on two or three giant balls of it clumped together and huge splices of portobello mushrooms laying on the top. Calamari is usually my go-to here, but their portion is very inconsistent every time. I will say they give a good-sized portion of mozzarella cheese sticks though. We also ordered the guac and bacon burger, but sad to say, in-n-out burger is even better than this.

Wow what a shame to be calling that deluxe or a burger in the same name. Shame. My burger had ONE piece of ""bacon"" (looked like fried cheese, tasted like feet) my bread was soggy from the pickles because the burger was made up of pickles and lettuce. I asked for it well done and it looked like it was cooked for 5 min. Your fries suck. They always have. Can't argue with that but at least make an effort. The stuffed mushrooms were ok.  The pizookies are lies just a regular cookie and I will NEVER order those again.

Wh an we were seated our drink and appitizer order was taken in a timely manner. After our appetizer was brought out our server came to take our order. That was the end kf the good servicr. We waited an hour to get our food! When it came out our food was cold. My husband's pizza came in the oven pan that it is cooked in which was COLD to the touch. My mother in laws food was cold and my food had a hair in it. (See picture below). When we got our food we hadn't seen our server for about 30 min. I saw him in another section while we were waiting for our food but then he disappeared. When we realized all of the issues with our food we looked for him and after about 10 minutes he appeared. I told him that there was hair in my food and he took the plate and said he'd get a manager. After about 10 minutes someone brought me a new plate of food which I did not ask for or want. About 10 minutes after that a manager finally came over and apologized. She said that she had been trying to make her way to our table. My husband told her that all of the food was cold when it was brought out and that there was a hair in my food. He didn't eat any of his pizza. She offered to remake it but we had already been there for almost 2hrs at this point (not counting the time we waited for the table) and were not in the mood to eat their food anymore. She removed the two uneaten entrees from our bill and took 50% off our lemonades, appetizer and my mother in laws food. Obviously this had been a horrible experience and we will not be back for dinner at this location.  Previous review: I get the lunch special to-go a lot from this location. It's close to work and I order on the app so that it is ready by the time I get there. It's a pretty good deal for the quality of the food you get especially compared to everything else close by. I get the half chicken club lunch special and it comes with thin cut fires (yum!) or wedges and soup or salad. The broccoli cheddar soup and chicken tortilla soup are both really good! The only thing I would say is to check your order before you leave.

First, my family eats here a lot and have found both the food and service to be consistently high quality.  On one occasion when I mentioned that the asparagus was tough, the server got a manager who came and spoke to me. This turned out to be positive experience. I honestly felt like the manager appreciated receiving my feedback.  I tried the Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl this week and it was awesome!  It's on the Enlightened Menu so it's a healthier choice. You can also get this entree with chicken, salmon or vegetarian. There was a lot of shrimp in this dish making it my new favorite! Another of my favorite entrees is the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp.  The fish and shrimp always taste fresh and are cooked perfectly. It's also on the Enlightened Menu.  One evening, I wanted a beer, but wasn't sure what to order. Our server, Nick, blew me away when I asked him for a recommendation. He actually ""paired"" my beer (like is done with wine) based on my tastes and meal. We were impressed.  Here's an important tip when dining at any BJ's. I strongly encourage you to download and use their smartphone app.  You get a free Pazooki just for downloading & using the app. Use the Preferred Waitlist function to minimize wait times. You can pay your bill, order ahead for dine-in or take-out, and you get reward points based on the amount you spend.

My deluxe burger was overcooked and my wife's pasta was cold.  Meanwhile we are eating, I already finished my Mule and my wife was out of Pepsi. I had to flag down another waiter to get my wife a refill. I didn't even order another alcoholic beverage because I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a drink again.

So of course I had to start off with those famous  Pizookies.The salted caramel and macadamia nut are couple of new arrivals to the dessert menu.And just like I remembered the original,these party mouth favors blasted my taste buds with sweet, salty,rich and robust flavors.Man,that was definitely  the highlight of my evening.Another new arrival that  I tried was the Roasted Maple Salmon Tacos.When  they brought it out it looked so good but I just had one problem.Apples,green apples I may add.The  sourness of the apple slices mixed in with the broccoli slaw definitely did not work for me.It may be good for some people but just not for me. The hostess was nice but the wait time to order took over twenty minutes,not cool.But in all fairness  it wasn't our servers fault.I think if management had  stepped in and helped out,it wouldn't of been such a problem.From what I saw,they were hanging out in the corners laughing it up like snootiness,definitely not cool.At least the pizookies were bomb.Peace",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2,2.88,2.77,2.764,2.636,2.814

My bf and I came in during happy hour and the hostess said we could sit anywhere in the bar area and offered us a booth that wasn't cleaned up yet. She said someone would come by to clean it so I accepted the booth. We sat down and waited for the table to be cleaned. While waiting, unnoticed the hostess was irritated and rolling her eyes as soon as customers turned away or as she turned away from them. This is a really bad look because she is the hostess. She is the first and last person customers come in contact with when eating here, it's unprofessional and it's rude; even though her gestures weren't towards me, it's irritating to see. Anyway. Our waitress came by, looked at the dirty table with plates and glasses on there and said ""let me get someone to clean this"". So we waited a little longer for her to grab a buser, but I'm sure she could have helped him since she's capable of doing so. After he came by and cleaned our table, the waitress came back to take our order only to realize we had no menus (: anyway.. got or menus and ordered our drinks and food. The food is always pretty good here which is why I like coming back. Asked for a side of ranch, 10 minutes later we got it. The restaurant wasn't too busy so the service was questionable to me. And if it was busy, and I missed something, then a Friday night during happy hour should have more staff available. Our waitress wasn't mean or rude in any way, but she wasn't very friendly either.

She told us she is POSITIVE because the pizzookie is out of the oven. - She comes back 10 min later to tell us the pizzookie was NOT made. We left immediately after having wasted almost 2 hours of our time. I am definitely not returning to this ridiculous place.

Our food was cold, the drinks were late, one order was so late we had all finished eating and then it came to our table so we had to ask for it to go. Once we let the manager know we were unhappy with the service and that we specifically asked not to be comped of any meals because we still ate it, the waiter comes back with one big check with some meals comped. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it, but the waiter then had to separate the orders, which was obviously frustrating him as he shook his head constantly and tossed chairs around at the table he sat in to figure all the orders out and which ones we comped. I'm guessing there was a lack of communication because before we started ordering food we let them know ahead of time there was 4 separate orders. Overall we don't blame our waiter, we let multiple staff members know of missing food and drinks, the manager ended up having ME separate our checks and just left the waiter to deal with the rest.

Then Greg the Mgr comes by very soft spoken is apologetic. At this point we had noticed that the Chicken tortilla soup we both had ordered didn't have chicken.

After the kids getting restless I noticed about 25 minutes went by and we hadn't received anything! No water. Not a hi! hello!...nada. I got up and asked the hostess if we can move some place where we could get service. She looked confused and said she would help. Finally another gal come by - looked like a lead but didn't introduce herself and stated they forgot about us. Sigh... Finally took our order and things started moving.  Thought that was the worst part - no!.... My kids ordered sliders from the children's menu. They came out after the mountain o' fries and chips/guac. I'm fixing the sliders for the kids with the condiments and O M G. The burger was charred. Like beyond belief charred. I sent it back right way. 15 minutes later we get it and kids so over the plethora o' fries ...Although we got 50% off our bill. I still shake my head. The last excuse from the manager/lead that stuck in my head... ""Well we cook our burgers well done for kids"" Im like huh? Being a chef myself...These weren't well done.

If you look at most bad reviews regarding this place, it is generally geared towards the quality of the service.  This place is packed and busy when I arrived. I did not mind the long wait, but server did not tell me that they will text the phone number that I gave them when it's my turn. So I never pay attention to the text and been waited so long that I noticed some other people ahead of me got seated. They should have told everyone that's how they will get notified of if its their turn.  After we got seated and handed the menu, we just asked to get water. Like most people, we waited, and waited, and waited, for 10, 15 minutes. No one comes. We were left unattended, ignored, while we see others who came after us and seated, were served with drinks already. This is unacceptable. The whole experience is just terrible. We decided it is not worth the wait time for this kind of service, and just left.  We will NEVER come back to this place! People, just look at the bad review from this place--you will see common complaints, which are obviously not being addressed by the restaurant at all. I do understand at rush hours the restaurant might be busy, but if you are constantly understaffed, for a long time, and have had customers complaint about this over and over, shouldn't you find ways to resolve this problem? The waiters/waitress may be very busy with multiple tables to be attended, but at least tell your customers that you will be with them, tell them you have not forget them, tell them your drink / food will be out shortly, or just do some thing to show your acknowledge to them.  From past experience, the food quality is okay, some are pretty good. But it is quite over priced for most items. For this kind of service, and the price range? We have better options. This is not a place to go.  I am glad we did not stay and left. Reading some other people's review here, where they were being ignored, food takes forever to come out, drinks takes forever to be refilled (if at all), and getting wrong orders, I am glad we left and able to avoid getting worse experience.

The waiter stated that they would probably take one of the meals off my bill. Oh come on, were they planning on charging me for both?  My pizza was cooked perfectly and was delicious. When I received the bill, I was not charged for the chicken, but was charged for the pizza, which happened to be $3.00 more.

48,Jessica K.,"West Covina, CA",161,17,,1.0,2017-06-16,"This was the worst I've ever been treated at BJ's.  I've been a faithful customer of BJ's throughout my life, going whenever there were celebrations to be had or for reuinions.  The food's good, the service is usually nice, and there's so many BJ's around that I can find one pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I will never be coming back to this one again. It was my friend's birthday yesterday.  I arrived at 7:15 PM.  The manager (blonde lady) was kind enough to help me sign in because none of the hostesses were paying me any attention even though I was standing at the counter.  We had 7 people, and she promised that it'll only take a 30 minute wait. So I went outside, my friends arrived, and 7:45 passed.  We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because it was busy, so we waited until 8:00, so we went to go check in to make sure I didn't realize the text message.  The manager was nowhere to be seen, so I went in to check with the hostesses (that blatantly ignored me before :( ) so I asked her, saying that I waited for 45 minutes already, and wondering what was going on.  And the girl was like oh!  we sat aside a SPECIFIC table for you so we're waiting for the people to leave.  But you guys are next!   (keep in mind, parties of 10, 19, 8 were called when we were promised to be next) So we were like oh that's fine, and then twenty minutes later (we waited for an HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES) she came back to us and said ""Hi, your table is READY, but...it may be too small to fit all seven of you.""  And we've already waited 2x the waittime promised, and we were promised that these hostesses were HOLDING A TABLE FOR US WHICH LENGTHENED OUR WAITING TIME ??????  WE WAITED 2X BECAUSE WE WERE WAITING FOR A SPECIFIC TABLE and then you come to us and say the TABLE CAN'T FIT US?  I don't understand, can they not realize you cannot fit seven people in a booth meant for FIVE?  When we went to check it out, every party who was sitting in those booths had FOUR or FIVE people. So we said, sorry this table cannot fit us, and they said oh, don't worry just wait 20 minutes longer and we'll get you a bigger table.  40 minutes later...table was finally ready.  We looked at each other, and thought, if their seating was THIS HORRIBLE, how would their waiters be on this night?   our night was already ruined, and it was my friend's birthday!  those hostesses kept giving us attitude and we were almost SURE we were asked to wait 40 minutes for the extra table just because they didn't like us.  because we had the NERVE to wonder why we weren't seated yet when we've already waited one hour and ten minutes.  we waited for two hours for a table...but BJ's already screwed up on SIMPLY SEATING us so we just left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=40,2.92,2.78,2.78,1.8920000000000003,2.836

We waited quite a while to get in to this location - about 35-40 minutes, but, when you show up w a party of 13...you gotta expect a bit of a wait. They really should consider taking reservations for parties over 8!  Kelly was our server - and a very good one he was. Super-attentive. Very patient. Always smiled and was polite.  Took the beverage order and when he came back for the rest of the order and no one was ready - he said he'd be back in 5 minutes and he was.  I order the Super Salad w/ Blackened Shrimp and was told to order the chili.  Others in my group had the Clam Chowder; the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl; the Appetizer Sampler Platter; the Lemon Thyme Chicken; and the Rib Eye Steak w White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes.  I was not so happy w my choice because I felt the dressing didn't represent properly. It needed more acidity. I did ask for extra lemons and got them rather quickly.  Now, I know what you're thinking...if you didn't really like your food - why the 4-Stars?  First, I have eaten at many BJ's and have ALWAYS enjoyed the food. This IS a new item and it just wasn't something I would order again.  2nd, dining out is so much more than just about the food - it's about the entire experience.  It happens to be that I had someone w Me who had a few dietary challenges. I called Kelly aside before everyone started ordering and explained that to him. He was very careful to take in everything I was saying and placed the order exactly as I requested. That may not sound like much to most people but the fact that he practically stopped everything to listen carefully when I was ordering something NOT ON THE MENU was so very appreciated.  I also had the Bowl of Chili which had a nice heat to it. Of course I like MORE heat but, the flavor was so on point it reminded of canned chili but done up! Sounds weird I know. It was tasty.  I tried my friends White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and was pleasantly surprised. I can instantly taste the white Cheddar and spices. I recommend you get some with any entree, sandwich or salad you order or simply order as a side dish. Yup THAT good. If you like beer...DUH! The beer is served ICE COLD! I had the Heff on tap!  The Rib Eye was cooked perfectly!  The Clam Chowder was tasty and had a lot of clams. When you get a waiter that hovers and you notice it - it's annoying. But, when you get one that hovers and you only know he's been there because your glass is filled and no one wants for anything - he's good at what he does! And as such he should be appreciated and tipped.  When he brought the check - the table applauded him. He was so embarrassed.  When I tipped him a hefty amount on a check for 13 people - he blushed.  As I left the restaurant, I asked to see the manager and shared the experience we had w Kelly. He was also happy to hear this. The reason I did this is because we have a tendency to make our bad experiences known but don't share the good ones. I like to share ALL my experiences - good, bad or indifferent - because it helps the establishment and recognizes those who should be.  So...get your grub on!!! Stop by a BJ's - and enjoy!  Share your experience and tip appropriately.  Tell them Chef Will sent you!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=40,2.72,2.77,2.78,2.256,2.75

I was about 4 bites into it and I noticed it tasted a little different I thought maybe the ranch dressing was a little bitter and after mixing the salad around some more I found a dead baby frog. Yes I said FROG! I've never experienced anything in my life like that. I informed the manager and he offered to comp our meal. I said no you can keep the food we are not eating here. He explained that there produce comes from a vendor but don't they wash there vegs before serving? I told him this frog could contain salmonella and who knows how long it's been sitting in a produce bag and he still made us pay for our drinks which consisting of three beers total!

41,Beah R.,"City of Industry, CA",308,69,43.0,1.0,2017-06-24,"I've been coming to this BJ's since 2011 and always recommended this branch to family and friends. However, I don't know what happened between now and 6 years ago but quality has certainly gone down.  I went here a few nights ago to celebrate with my significant other by grabbing a nice dinner. To begin with, there were no hostess at the front. We waited a good ten minutes to flag someone down to check us in. When we were called to our seats we were greeted by a gentlemen who introduced himself as our server.  My boyfriend ordered a burger, and I ordered a medium pizza with 2 cups of ranch. Our appetizer came first and we finished it right away since we didn't eat all day. About fifteen minutes later or so, our pizza and burger is dropped off and my pizza is flat out cold. The crust tasted stale and the cheese wasn't even melting into the dough! I could not find my server anywhere because he literally dropped it off and walked away. I flagged down another server who I made the complaint to and he took my pizza and microwaved it?? I think that's a little gross.  If your restaurant was understaffed then organize the tables and settings better so no customers order is left behind. I am not okay with paying like $15 for a cold mediocre pizza I could have gotten cheaper, better, and more fresh at a 7-11.  I don't think I'll be visiting this branch again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=40,2.56,2.68,2.724,1.956,2.632

My friends and I came here and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. We were starving from a tiring day so we were excited to start ordering our food. I found it odd that they did not take our drink orders right away l, but we decided to wait patiently because it was clearly a very busy dinner.  After about 25 minutes of waiting we FINALLY got a waiter to take our order, we had to catch the attention of a waiter just walking by. The waiter took our order and said that we would get free dessert, that somewhat made up for it but the wait for our food was ridiculous. A waiter later came up to us an apologized because he apparently forgot that we were part of his section. He was paying more attention to a bigger party of people next to our table.  It was the end of our dinner and we then waited another 30 minutes or so for our free desserts. At this point of the night we were there for over 4 hours when we were expecting to be done with dinner in 2. We finally got our desserts and had to wait a little longer for the check just to be give to us.

When that wouldn't have happen if they got the order right the first time.  Plus our waitress recommended the churro pizookie as one of the best ones, when in reality it was complete shit. It was just a stack of churros with ice cream but the churros seemed to have been cooked earlier during the day, so they weren't that fresh.

17,Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32.0,1.0,2017-07-29,"So we went to BJ's to try their new items which have been advertised heavily.  Well, all I can say the advertising is much better than the food that you get.  Our dinner party was so disappointed.  Brewhouse Slow-Roasted Menu needs more QA.   The Prime Rib was truly tasteless.  No seasoning.  The Pork Chop was cooked very well, but again, no seasoning at any level.  The ribs tasted like day old re-fired ribs.   This is what BJ's states 'After a long series of taste tests and tweaks, we have perfected our Brewhouse Slow-Roasted entrees and sandwiches, delivering amazing taste at an affordable price,"" said Trojan. ""We spend hours slow-roasting every cut of meat so that our guests can spend every second enjoying it.' We spent zero seconds enjoying these new items due to a complete lack of seasoning.  Now the real mess was the new chicken burgers.  One is a regular chicken sandwich and the other has avocado and an egg served on top.  Well, these two items need to be reevaluated.  The regular chicken sandwich was just plain weird.  It was four small parts (lord knows what parts!) of a chicken put in between a bun and served up.  It was strange and tasted even stranger.  It looked like left over chicken was used to create this chicken burger. Now the real mess was the chicken burger with avocado and an egg on top.  First off the presentation was horrible.  The egg was off the sandwich and when the waiter tried to put it back on the sandwich it burst and you now had an egg yolk mess in your hands.  I literally was grossed out on the mess this sandwich made  I could have been in a horror film if someone looked at my hands and the many napkins I needed.  The bun instantly disintegrated due to the liquid mess and it became inedible without a fork and knife.  Terrible experience. We wrapped it up by trying the new Churro Pizookie.  It is a bunch of Churros with some Ice Cream.  Not for me as the sugar on all the churros was just too much.  Now, adding just a few Churros to a regular Pizzokie would work for me. BJ's QA is extremely spotty from location to location and I don't get it.  You should have the same quality and consistency at each establishment.  Also, the service is so different from establishment to establishment.  There is no excuse for the QA or the spotty service.  For a party of six, we were there close to 4 hours due to the length of time we had to wait for our server, our drinks, our orders in and finally our food.  I serious undercover boss is warranted for BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2,2.28,2.7,2.672,2.052,2.532

Lastly, we decided to share the churro pizookie -- there was a mini corndog covered in cinnamon sugar mixed with the churros.  Accidents happen, but when combined with the previous incidents it just grew into a frustrating evening.  It should have been a fun birthday dinner, but instead we ended up with lackluster service and subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2?start=60,2.16,2.71,2.66,2.216,2.49

We were sat down at our table and we literally sat waiting to be greeted by a server for over 30 min. There were four groups that were seated in our immediate area and had their orders taken down and drinks brought out before we  were even addressed. So I got up and walked to the front desk and asked to talk to a manager. This Hispanic lady came out I don't remember her name but she walked out like we were bothering her. She asked what the issue was and I explained and I told her I'm not here for a free meal I don't want any complimentary services I just wanted the problem of the horrible customer service fixed. She replied with well I know you guys came hungry so let me take care of you and I apologize. Lol first off that's not how you respond to customers. Secondly she responded with a aggressive attitude and I told her that your attitude sucks first off and it's obvious nothing is going to happen. So I we took our business elsewhere and the manager didn't give two shits if we left or not. She walked right off like it was nothing. I love BJ's and I will continue to eat there but NEVER at the West Covina one. If you want to be ignored for a half hour then have the crappy management treat you like crap then go to West Covina. This review is for the people of yelp because I know nothing is going to happen to that manager and the customer service will not change. If your understaffed that's not our problem hire more people. She should not be in management acting that way. Plain and simple, if I could give them zero stars I would.

We were told it would take about 10-15 mins before we can be seated or we had the option of sitting in the bar area, so we decided to just sit by the bar. BIG MISTAKE. We waited around 5 mins and no one bothered to approach us to even give us our menus despite seating another couple. So we decided we would rather wait the 10-15 mins to actually receive service. Luckily, we just went up to the host and was seated immediately.  I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and although it tasted good, I don't plan on ordering it again because despite being on a diet, it is too light of a meal for me personally. I felt as if my salmon was slightly smaller than the first time I tried it, but it was so long ago that I honestly don't remember. For the same price, I rather order my fettuccini alfredo and just bring half of it home so I can eat it as leftovers the next day. It comes out to be about the same calories anyway if you only eat half of the fettuccine, although I do understand that it won't be as healthy as the salmon, so there's the dilemma.

The Caesar sales tasted so drab, the dressing lacked any flavor & definitely contained no anchovy.    Considering the crowds, reviews, & recommendations I expected a bit more than a bad meal.  I recommend you blow off BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2,2.16,2.54,2.636,2.8880000000000003,2.388

Then when our food was ready and presented to our table, our server had to explain to us that one of our dishes got taken from another server to another table ,, therefore we had to wait for that dish, our server apologized for the confusion ,, the dish was then delivered to us, after 10 minutes,, we then realized that no one gave us utensils before or after our food was delivered.

He arrived after 10min to our table and he never offered me a menu. He just asked what I would like to drink which i ordered a Sangria (it was pretty good). My friends ordered wings not one of them got utensils, or napkins. We had to go to other table and grab some.  He later came and said that they were last call and if we like to add anything to this we ordered a pizzookie(which is always amazing). Me and friends were talking and they told me that since they were seated the server had an attitude and no friendly attitude to be seen. I would not complaint if it was a first time but we go there all the time at least once a week and there has been a trend the server is always rude and not very attentive.

I understand that they're perhaps understaffed and can't attend us as fast as possible but that's not even the problem that we've come across. The waiters just have no consideration for their customers and anytime we ask for something they take forever to bring it to us, whether it be water, ranch or ketchup. This past Monday we arrived at 11 pm and there was no one at the front desk to sit us down, waiters passed by and they all looked at us and didn't say a word. We stood for 15 minutes and no one helped us out. We sat ourselves down at the bar area and our waiter was a big tall white man with a beard, made no eye contact with us and seem aggravated. We switched from a booth to a table and he seemed mad because we did that, our food finally came out and we realized we had no utensils on our table, we had to steal utensils from a table further away from ours because our waiter never came near us for us to ask. We usually leave tips but this night we decided that enough was enough. There's another short guy with short black hair that works the bar area as well, he wouldn't know what hospitality was if it hit him on the face. Other than that, the food is good. It takes time to arrive but we usually don't mind. On one occasion they didn't bring out our plate of wings, 20 mins after our waitress came by and said there was an issue with the system and the order never reached the kitchen, at this point we were annoyed and asked her to not bring it out anymore.

I've been here about 5 times in the past two years, but the last two experiences have left me less than impressed. I came in this past Sunday with my family and we were there for over two hours after we were seated. We came in early so our wait time was only ten minutes. Once we were seated and our orders taken, it took forever to get our food. We ordered my favorite Honey Siracha Brussels Sprouts to start. I ordered extra sauce on it, since the last time we visited this location they put barely any on it. There was extra sauce as requested but this time, the texture of some of the Brussel sprouts wasn't great.  The main complaint was the wait time. My mom and I split a medium pizza and after a long wait it was brought out. (I guess they don't offer to serve your first slices here, as they do at other locations.) they said the rest of our parties' food would be following right behind. Well it eventually came ten minutes later. My dad said his steak was mediocre, but my Grandma enjoyed her Cobb Salad. When we got the bill we asked the server why it was such a long wait that night. He said they were short staffed because people called in sick and such. He was apologetic. I frequent several BJ's in the valley and Orange County and this location needs an overhaul!

Dinner came out one or two at a time so we didn't really eat together. we did have the late appetizers to nosh while the others started with their entrees. Same weird configuration for dessert.

He never apologized for forgetting the drink or for our pizza coming out lukewarm. He never took accountability for his lack in service. If he apologized and owned up to forgetting it would have made a difference, but instead he continued to lie. Cameron was very sweet to help when it wasn't his area. Jason was not good at all and it wasn't busy in the restaurant either. No excuse for bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-covina-2,3.36,2.67,2.756,,2.9459999999999997
