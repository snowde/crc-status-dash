158,Jisha J.,"St. Charles, IL",19,119,,4.0,2012-03-15,"I've been to this place several times and I've always had a good experience here. It is not necessarily a cheap meal, but overall it's good food. I have tried several of their salads, and they have all been really good. Their pizza is pretty tasty, but I don't think it's all that special. What I love the most is their pizookie desserts. My boyfriend and I will stop by here sometimes for their cookies n' cream pizookie. It's absolutely delicious with a warm, gooey chocolate cookie with this ""cookies n' cream"" cream on top along with whipped cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=140,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.7359999999999998,2.92

191,S G.,"Seattle, WA",0,57,4.0,1.0,2012-04-23,"Went here for lunch and things got started off on the wrong foot. Several staff walked right by us with out asking if we had been helped when we were obviously waiting for a table, we were not the only ones waiting and the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess couldn't be bothered to even look up at us from her register to help us and eventually a waiter from a different section got us a table. We ordered some beers and when I went to take a sip out of mine the bottom of the glass separated from the glass and beer dumped all over our table and all over my lap. We started to corral the beer to keep it from running off the table. I asked a passing waiter for some towels and noted the spill, a little bit later our waiter came to the table and exclaimed that this glass breakage is a common occurrence, he failed to help us in any way and by the time the other waiter returned to the table with the towels, we had already cleaned up all the liquid and just used the towels to try and keep everything from getting sticky. I could be wrong but I don't recall anyone apologizing for the broken glass, my beer soaked pants or anything else. They failed to bring us new napkins, did not comp the beer or make any effort to make amends for the situation. They failed to clear the beer soaked napkins and towels until we insisted that they take them off of our table, this was after our waiter and another waiter had been at our table no less then 3-4 separate times to bring us new drinks, food, etc. In addition to that mess, they did not bring us straws which we asked for 3 times and our water glasses sat empty a few times for quite a while.  The food was OK, not fantastic, just OK. The beer was not very good and definitely not worth all the headache. The service here is beyond horrible, their service manager should lose their job for the obvious lack of training that they have done. I do not expect much from places like this, but there is a level of basic service that any restaurant should provide and these guys failed to do so in just about every way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=180,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.404,2.92

192,Leslie Q.,"Westminster, CO",10,4,,1.0,2012-05-06,"Listen, I'm no critic.  It's very easy to please me.  However, tonight we go to BJ's.  Beers came out 10 minutes later, we get our dinner salad well before our appetizer, little annoying but no biggie... But here's the real issue: Someone (food runner maybe) delivers our pizza to our neighboring table, they put a spatula in it, and sit with it until the server shows up  and they point out that it's not theirs.  Our server takes it back into the kitchen, brings it back out with their actual pizza, throws ours on our table, says ""it's a long story, I'll be back..."", goes to their table apologizes profusely and sends out a manager to them.  Then she comes back to our table, but never explains that another table had our pizza at it for about 5 minutes.  When we ask her about it she says ""in my defense...(enter excuse here)"" but she never apologized.  Anyway, I am positive that is a health code violation but that's besides the point.  We never heard anything but excuses from her and when she sent a manager to talk to us, she hovered over the table and then went 20 feet away and vented to her coworkers about the event... And as we left a little bit later, we were followed by the eyes of everyone from our server to the hostess.  Holy crap.  Take responsibility.  It was a mistake, a gross mistake, but we're all human.  Instead of putting the blame on everyone else, take responsibility, apologize, and chances are we wont even need a manager.  We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=180,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.404,2.92

Food: Ugh...the menu is impressive, but the food was not. The mushroom appetizers tasted like they were warmed up the day before. The side salad was cheaply made. And finally the pizza that the server raved about was offensive. In fact it pissed us off and our dogs barely choked it down. The most flavorful thing we had there was the toothpick on the way out.

126,Joe J.,"Denver, CO",68,474,93.0,3.0,2012-06-04,"We ate here this weekend for lunch.  It was neither good nor bad.  It was average.  Everything was average, well except for the price. I really don't mind paying alot for a really good meal and good service.  Our waiter was a bit older of a guy, and he just seemed uninterested.  Just about every time he came by to check on us, he would be saying something as he walked away.  We literally would have a laugh about it when he was out of ear-shot.   We shared an appetizer of Avacado Egg Rolls.  They were, well, average.  I wasn't blown away by them or the accompanying sauce.  For $10, they were not worth it.  We also shared a pizza.  I actually really liked the pizza, and the way they sliced the mushrooms that went on it.  I don't always care for the huge slices you get at the chain-type pizza joints.  These mushroom were thinly sliced and were not dominant to the slice.  Thumbs up.   Basically, I'd rate this higher if the whole meal cost us about 20% less and if our main server was as good as the two other people who gave us occasional service.  I might consider going back when I'm in the area again, but with other solid options in the area, this place has to do more.   The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice, but our booth had leather seats, and the leather on my seat was slightly cracking and about 100 butts from tearing and needing replace.  A couple tweaks here and there, and the rating would go up, but I can't rate this place more than a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=120,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.7,2.88

50,Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4475,2216,19024.0,3.0,2012-08-28,"Westminster BJ's is similar to most BJ's except its slower, duller, and more forgettable. Three of us came for a late night dinner, but too early for the 10:00-11:00 late night BJ's happy hour. There were about 5 other tables of glassy-eyed customers quietly eating & drinking. This may have been the quietest BJ's experience of my life. I got my usual Jeremiah Red while the others tried wine. For dinner, I opted for the Tuscan Chicken Limone with Angel Hair Pasta covered with Steamed Baby Spinach and a Lemon-Butter Sauce with sauteed Garlic, Artichoke Hearts, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. The pasta was slightly overcooked and the sauce a little thick, but it was filling and a-ok.  Pat S. got a Portobello Mushroom & Fontina Cheese Deep-dish Pizza while Olivia Z. tackled a Grilled Steak Salad with Skirt Steak, oven-roasted Potatoes, Baby Greens, Bleu Cheese, Yellow Squash, Red Onion, Zucchini, Red Peppers, and Hard-boiled Egg. Luckily, they got full quickly and shared their dishes. Both were fine, but not really special. Service was genuine. It was a slow night for the restaurant and a slow night to be working at BJ's, so, I can fully understand the lack of enthusiasm. Parking is free and easy in the shared lot. When you want BJ's and are near Westminster then this is the place to go. The meal may not be the happy ending you're looking for, but at least you'll leave contented for a little while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.636,2.84

Their roast beef au jus is the only thing I have to complain about.  For the past several years it's been the same...as in Salty, dried meat and Nasty!!  This is the one thing I don't like that I've tried.   I do love their pasta plates and salads.  Soups are always delicious as well.  If you have room for dessert, you'll be heaven with their pizookies.  Yummy I've tried every flavor and depending on my flavor taste buds of the day, it's all my favorite.   I do miss their meatloaf they use to have, but it's not been on the menu in almost 3 years. :(  They have an extensive food menu as well as beer, but I don't like beer and since I don't drink anymore, food is the only reason why I go here.

Hate that feeling and to spend money on a bad experience too. It started off bad when my family of 4 was seated in a booth and they knew I have an 8 month old but they told us to put her with the car seat actually resting on the table. It felt sooooo crammed. Then my 8 month old needed to eat and my 3 year old hit his head on the table...crying kids and the waitress approaches and asks for our drink order...haven't even looked at the menu with making the bottle and settling down my 3 year old after the head bonk....okay now let's look at the menu...My husband ordered the brewhouse blond beer which he did enjoy. We decided on the sweet pig (hawaiian) hand tossed pizza. I also ordered a house salad out first. The salad was just meh. The croutons tasted stale but I did like the sliced cucumber and tomato. The pizza came and I could not believe the size. We ordered the 14' sharable and it was so tiny and thin. I did not know hand tossed meant thin crust. We were soooo disappointed and it was just luke warm like it had been sitting on the counter waiting for someone to take it to our table...and considering it was empty in the restaurant I am not sure why it didn't come right out. It didn't help that both our kiddos missed their naps today as we spent the day in Boulder, so they were fussy during dinner and the whole experience just was not enjoyable....I will not order the hand tossed again.

The hostess seemingly forgot to mention our presence to our waiter because we sat for 15 minutes without recognition. It wasn't until we went up to the hostess stand and asked for service, until we got any. They were apologetic at first, but the service didn't improve. My meal was wrong and my mom's soup was cold when it arrived. They had a diverse menu, so I wanted to bring my husband back. I chalked up the first visit to ""a bad first impression."" I took my husband back a few weeks later and we had a decent experience. They were very busy, but we were adequately attended to. Food, again, below my standards. We were shopping in the area a few weeks later and decided to give it one more chance. That was a mistake! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger - one of their new menu items since they reduced the menu to half of what it was. When it finally arrived, I was shocked. It was crumbled ground beef on lettuce and looked inedible. Plus, they forgot the cheese and bacon! When I brought this oversight to our waitress, she was apologetic and said she'd be right back with bacon and cheese. I didn't think, for one second, that she would actually come back with cheese and bacon on a plate. I figured she had misspoken and would be back with a fresh, correct, bacon cheeseburger. Nope. She actually expected me to put cold cheese and bacon on some crumbled ground beef. When I told her I wanted a new burger, she took mine away and brought a new one out 10 minutes later. They comped the burger, but still charged me for the plate of cheese and bacon that I didn't even eat. We won't be back.

This location has great wait staff, and the manager always seems to be walking around, checking on all the tables to see how their experience is going. However, the host/hostesses, in my opinion, are awkward! Really, every time I come in I feel like it takes them a good minute to realize there is someone standing there (I'm short... but I'm not THAT short), or they talk in groups amongst themselves while getting your menus together and then just walk away, assuming you'll follow I guess? That is my one and only gripe about this place.         We've tried their honey sriracha brussels sprouts, and BJ's original chicken wings as starters, and they are both super good. I could eat their brussels sprouts every day. We've enjoyed a variety of entrees, fish and chips (malt vinegar included, thank you BJ's), their enLIGHTened turkey burger, spaghetti and meatballs, and their chili is really good too! The menu is huge, and it's all delicious, so it's a great option to bring your picky relatives to, if they can't find something at BJ's...well, they're ridiculous people. Of course you can't forget about the amazing Pizookies for dessert, so yummy.        But the shining star that brings me back time and time again...is the Berry Burst Cider, folks, this is the real deal. It is perfectly tangy, just the right balance of sweetness, oh my gosh...it is just the bee's knees...and if you visit BJ's and don't give it a try, you're a foolish human! Just kidding, but really, it's a sin to not drink a Berry Burst or 3 while you're here ;) Looking forward to my next visit, awkward hosts and all.

The monkey bread is seasonal but give me just about anything covered in cinnamon and sugar and then leave me in a corner by myself. And don't look at me. It isn't pretty, but I'll be happy for the next year or two.  Overall they've mastered cooking chicken. I'm no chef but every time I cook chicken it's been hit or miss with tenderness and juiciness. Not here. My SO and friends have ordered other chicken dishes, and 9 out of 10 it's cooked perfectly. I need the secret!!  Perfectly!!

I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy yet so juicy inside. And the lemony cream sauce on top is just fantastic. My husband had the rib eye also with potatoes/broccoli. He said the steak was well seasoned and easy to chew (not tough like other places) and cooked just how he asked. Needless to say he finished the entire plate. My toddler had a kids meal which he picked at and ate a little here and there, which is the usual because he's a picky toddler all of a sudden. But he did tell me the fries were very yummy. The chocolate chunk pizookie was spectacular! Fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top, simplicity makes this one so good. The only thing I would skip are the fruity cocktails. I ordered the watermelon basil margarita and I expected some fresh watermelon in there. It does say puree, but I'm pretty sure it was some type of syrup. It didn't taste like real watermelon and it gave the drink a syrup like consistency. The signature margarita is much better. The reason for the 5 starts instead of 4 was our server Tyler. He was the best! Informative, nice, always checked on us. That is the kind of server all restaurants need.

Of course the beers on tap are always a good choice, but I think I'll have to take on dinner at BJ's next time, unless it's $3 Pizooki Tuesday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=20,2.84,3.02,3.02,,2.9480000000000004

21,Shannon H.,"Westminster, CO",0,11,4.0,3.0,2017-05-03,Ok for food... lettuce was over its prime for freshness. Stuffed mushrooms were mediocre for warmth. Service was prompt and efficient... needed a bit more personality.  Large table next to us consumed much of our server's time. Very demanding... unfortunately for her. No toasted almonds on the beet and arugula salad... substituted what appeared to be pumpkin seeds.. no warning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=20,3.0,3.04,3.04,,3.0240000000000005

3,John K.,"Irvine, CA",61,100,749.0,4.0,2017-06-29,"I've been to several different BJs in California, but the deep dish pizzas here are a little different.  I've been to this location several times already whenever I'm in town, and the crust always comes out soft and more doughy, rather than crispy and crunchy that's almost like it's fried in oil.  I know it's all a preference of taste, but if you like the soft breadlike type crust, then you would enjoy it.  The avocado egg rolls here are just how they are at other locations and delicious!  Clam chowder is always good here... thick and hearty.  I usually use the BJs phone app to pre-order so that when I arrive, they start the cooking, but the last 2 times I've been there they seem to not find my order so I've had to put it through with the waitress again.  Anyways, can't go wrong with the food here for the most part!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster,3.24,3.09,3.09,,3.15

I love that they brew their own versions of sodas that the kids can have with unlimited refills this is a very nice option for families I do really like the root beer. Good fish tacos good salads and the cookies are awesome.

When we were being seated, the host walked us by easily six empty two-top tables in a not-busy section, and attempted to to seat us next to a huge group of like 10 people with a bunch of kids. Oh hell no. For food, I got a bbq chopped salad and it was a huge mount of iceberg lettuce topped a thin layer of chicken and cheese.  Not worth the $15 price tag.
