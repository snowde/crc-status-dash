249,Erin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",581,496,144.0,4.0,2012-01-14,"BJ's opens at 11.  I got there at 10:20am. Sigh..  Returned at 11:03, got seated, and stared at the menu for a long ass time. I was so famished, I couldn't decide what to get because I wanted to eat EVERYTHING. Our waiter was very patient with us and kept periodically checking on us in case we decided on anything LOL - spinach and artichoke dip: I can never get over how good this is. Not sure if it's just good at BJ's but just .. generally: this appetizer is ALWAYS a good choice. - california burger: I LOVE ME A GOOD BURGER, AND THIS ONE WAS GOOOOOOOOOOOD. sourdough bread, medium rare, avocado, grilled chilis (i think), cilantro.. I guess sourdough burgers are more like a sandwich, but it was super tasty. DEF REC THIS ONE. - small pizza (half Mediterranean, half great white): did you know you can order pizzas half and half (as long as it's not a mini sized one)?? Anyway, the mediterranean one is NOT GOOD AT ALL. I'm not usually a fan of medi food, but my friend wanted it, so I gave it a try. Olives were WAY too salty, feta cheese too sour, and mehhh not my fave. As for the Great White, I can now officially announce that it is too salty for me to ever order again. Alas, the first time it was so delightful, the 2nd time I thought it was just a bad day, but 3rd time confirms it. Never again. - beer in a 750ml bottle: it was some kind of Belgian ale. It was really light and kind of fruity, and just overall wtver. I should have just ordered one of their standard house brews. It was reallllllllly foamy, too. So strange. - classic pazookie: did you know they have mini pazookies? Just one scoop of ice cream and one kind of cookie. It's small but enough for you to enjoy the warm gooey goodness of a pazookie :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=280,3.28,3.25,3.25,2.768,3.262

Our food took unusually long to come out so the manager came over without us even complaining and offered to give us our appetizer for free as an apology.

175,Hilary L.,"Brooklyn, NY",535,8,,1.0,2012-03-02,"I'VE GOTTEN FOOD POISONING TWO TIMES AT THIS LOCATION. Don't worry I'm not stupid--I don't choose to eat here so that I could get sick again. Of the four times I've come here, only the first was by choice. Other times were work-related, etc. Think about it though--that's a 50% poison rate. And I'm not the only one who's been sick here. Likewise, the service was awful. Contrary to what a waiter would be doing, we were the ones waiting on him.  The first time I got sick from this restaurant, I had ordered the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta, sometime last January. This time around, I got the mini deep dish classic combo pizza, which I found a little peculiar that it was served on a plate instead of in the dish it was prepared in, as deep dish pizzas usually are. But I figured--maybe it's because it's a mini. And I figured, I'm getting neither pasta nor seafood. What can possibly go wrong? I STAND CORRECTED. Don't get me wrong, I've always loved BJ's--but it was thanks to this location that I now can't stand pasta--I even feel a little sick sometimes when I think about it, even though I used to love it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=180,3.12,3.24,3.24,2.404,3.1920000000000006
414,Rani N.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,15,,4.0,2012-03-02,"This was actually my first visit to BJ's. Not sure why. It always struck me as the typical American restaurant, which serves everything from pasta and pizza to tacos and burgers. A way better version of Friday's, Chili's.... Typically, you can find a thing or two you'd like on their menus, and once you do, you stick to it because you know everything else is not going to be as good.   I went there for a late lunch and it wasn't very crowded. In the past, i had stayed away because of the long wait. I ended up having the California Chicken sandwich with crispy thin fries and BJ's Jeremiah Red beer. The  sandwich was good, but it was mostly the avocado and chipotle mayo that did the trick, not the chicken itself. The beer was the standout for me, so I'm glad I tried it. I think I would go there again in the future, probably to catch a basketball game and to try their pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=340,3.12,3.25,3.25,2.8000000000000003,3.198
180,KK -.,"San Mateo, CA",77,304,125.0,2.0,2012-03-13,"This place is really very ""meh."" Yes, I know it is a chain restaurant and there should not be high expectations held...but come on! I enjoy the restaurant when I dine there in Orange County - can't Los Angeles provide me the same experience? Guess not. The girls and I decided to come here during Dank Restaurant Deals week for Westwood and UCLA students. I also have still never ventured to BJ's in Westwood before, either so I thought it would be good to play it safe with a place that I am familiar with.  Apparently, BJ's gets very busy every day of the week. There were multiple parties waiting outside because it is VERY small inside. I wasn't used to this particluar size of the restaurant since the other BJ's that I've been to are quite roomy. We were given a wait time of about 35-45 minutes, which kind of stunk since we were hungry but we were already there. What are girls to do while they wait for their table? SHOP, OF COURSE! We hit up a store nearby to kill time since it was cramped inside and outside. About 35 minutes later, we come back to BJ's because it was the time that the hostess had originally told us to return. However, when we arrived, not only were the waitresses unhelpful and ignoring us, but when we finally were able to grab her attention, she told us another 15 minutes. Understandable, there are people who are still hanging at their tables even though they're done with their meals and have paid...but the two hostesses at the stand ignored us for a good 5+ minutes...and we were standing right in front of them.  After about 20 MORE minutes, we were seated...at a table that was open for quite a while, we realized. Onto ordering... The girls had been raving about the hand-crafted root beer and how delicious it tasted. I had never tried it before whenever I had gone to a BJ's but I decided to play it safe and have water. I should have ordered my own root beer, because when I tried my friend's drink, it was absolutely FRESH and AMAZING! It wasn't carbonated like your typical root beer and didn't taste like it was filled with preservatives. This root beer was light and didn't burn your throat like the initial taste of soda. Awesome. For food, I decided to go with the BBQ Beef Sandwich with a side of shoe-string thin fries. This dish was honestly just very plain. The sandwich came with tender Angus roast beef in BBQ sauce, melted provolone cheese on a toasted garlic cheese French roll topped with our crunchy, sweet onion strings. The roll was a bit too crunchy... yet soggy and I definitely didn't taste any garlic cheesiness. Sad. The Angus beef was actually tasty - it was thinly sliced and the proportion of the BBQ was nice.  All in all, the sandwich as a whole was just very MEH. It definitely wasn't the greatest BBQ sandwich that I have ever had but I wasn't expecting it to begin with.. My friends ordered mini pizzas and really enjoyed it. I should have gone with a mini pizza, too. Sad life.  It took forever to get seated, forever to get our food, and forever to get our bill...then forever for them to take the bill. SIGH.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=240,3.04,3.26,3.26,2.536,3.1720000000000006

To date, I've had their pizza three times, and not once have I been impressed. The flavor of the bread is a bit off, and there is just too much of it. I'd prefer a crispier crust, and more toppings/filling.   - 2 stars APPETIZERS: are alright. I've had the Ahi (Tuna) Poke once, which I would recommend if you're looking for something light. Today I tried the calamari, which was as mediocre as their pizza.  - 2 stars DESSERT: Of course, go for the pizookie. Crispy crust, with gooey, chocolate-y center topped with vanilla ice cream. But although I find myself loving it in small portions, it's just way too saccharine in large portions.   - Up to 3 stars OVERALL:  For UCLA students, a nice place to grab dinner and a pizookie for a birthday or date--although a bit on the pricier side.

Drinks came fast enough.  When placing order, I asked for the atlantic salmon, which comes with soup or salad.  I chose the clam chowder.  My sister ordered a fish dish as well, and the menu said that it also comes with a side salad or cup of soup.  Alex confidently told my sister that it does not.  This got my attention, because I've read the menu.  But, I let it go. Alex accidentally left a menu on the table, so I took a look at it.  We were right, my sister's dish came with soup or salad. Eventually drink refills came from another server, so Alex must've gotten slammed or overwhelmed.  We flag down this server and mention that one of the meals came with soup or salad, and would like to order it.  We order a salad, no problem. So the main dishes come, no soup or salad.  The server (different from Alex) comes and we tell her.  She comes back with the salad and soup. So, we eat our salad and soup while our main dish sits on the table and gets cold. Food was typical. Nothing special, but it tasted good.  Alex comes by in the MIDDLE of our meal and asks if we want dessert.  We kind of looked at each other as if to say ""uh, we're not even there yet..."" and said, ""Maybe later."" Later never came. Alex never came back to take a dessert order.  My niece and nephew usually like dessert, but said F it because they waited for so long.  We waited close to 25 minutes from the time we were done eating until we got the check.

Sometimes, you can get decent service if you're really lucky and its not busy. Although, an empty restaurant still doesn't guarantee decent nor attentive service at this BJ's location. After one unbelievably dreadful visit, I decided to write a little review about my experience to BJ's through their official website. I said nothing nasty, just saying that I will be a returning customer since I am a huge fan of the Great White pizza, but that I really wish service would be more courteous, attentive, and pleasant. The manager of this specific location called me just a day after leaving a VM asking to chat about my experience. I called back a day after and we chatted about the experience. Again, nothing nasty was said nor exchanged and since we stated that we'll be back again, the manager politely offered a gift card and asked for the address to mail it to. I was stoked! However, it has been over 2 months and I have yet to receive such ""giftcard"". I've been in Westwood for over 4 years now, and I will be moving out. I wanted to visit BJ's one last time, but it really looks like this location doesn't value their customers.

219,Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,,1.0,2012-09-22,"I've come here many times but will NEVER return.  I had a large group for my birthday and it was a terrible experience.  First, since large groups have automatic gratuity, the waitress had absolutely NO incentive to give good service, and it showed.  It took forever to flag her down to order anything, and she disappeared for a good 15 minutes straight when we were trying to order our food. Then they started bringing things to our table that we did not order (including an entire pizza and a couple drinks), and acted rudely when we explained we hadn't ordered those things.  Later, my friend had ordered a side salad, but they brought him the entree size.  When he explained he only wanted the smaller size, the busboy just said he would leave the entree size at our table and we could ""figure it out"" later.  Of course, no side salad ever came, but we were charged for the full entree size! When it came time to pay the bill, things got really bad.  Having a large group is complicated (and of course, they don't provide any ability to have separate checks), and we were confused by how much money we apparently owed.  After having everyone at the table go through the receipt line by line, we realized we were charged for an entire pizza, a pitcher of beer, and two pints that we never ordered OR received.  When we pointed this out, the waitress was rude to us, took the receipt we had which had all our notes on how much each person owed and which items they got, and brought us a new receipt that was about $20 less.  So we had to repeat the entire process again.  At this point, because the waitress kept disappearing, it had already taken well over half an hour just to figure out the check!  We were fed up with the process, and finally agreed to just pay the check as is, because we just wanted to leave. After we signed our receipts, the waitress told us that we were $24 over.  We were so tired of being in that awful place that we didn't even care about them overcharging us.  We left, and when I was walking down the street, the waitress came running after me.  Apparently, even though she never came to our table, she had no problem finding me in the street.  She then told me we were actually $24 UNDER, so I had to go back in and pay the remaining $24.  She then cracked a dumb joke about me having to pay on my own birthday, as if that was going to make me feel any better about the whole experience. I will NEVER come back to this BJs, and probably not any BJs.  I had a good birthday tradition going for three years, but it's over now.  I can't believe how much money we had to pay for terrible service (no choice because it's automatic gratuity!) and mediocre food (which, by the way, is one of the cheapest and easiest foods to make).  It was embarrassing for me and my friends, and we all had to pay way more than we should have just to leave that awful place.  Oh, and to cap it all off, the birthday pizookie is now about the size of a thimble.  It used to be wayyy bigger. So we had awful service, were charged way too much, were forced to give an 18% tip on an inflated bill, and spent almost an hour just trying to settle the check.  What a terrible way to celebrate a birthday.  I wouldn't even go back if they gave me a free pizza.

Unfortunately, when our party of 5 arrived at BJ's in Westwood on Thanksgiving Eve, we were told they were out of ALL potatoes. We decided to start off with 2 orders of the Fried Artichokes (because one is never enough).  They told us that they were out but were making more.  With only a 7 minute wait for more we said we could wait. They came out fresh and delicious.   My bf ordered the soup and salad.  The soup looked and smelled amazing but we had to ask what kind of soup is this?  The guy who brought it told us it was tortilla soup.  So we sent it back since he had ordered chicken noodle and that's what he was in the mood for.  Turns out he wasn't too impressed with the chicken noodle and regrets sending the tortilla back since that one seemed like it would have tasted better.  His salad was served frozen, so we sent it back too.  The one they brought right back to him was much better.  This also allowed the server a little extra time to bring out the second dressing he had requested when we had initially place our order.   My dad ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was white and fluffy and the breading was crispy.   My step mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich which also had onion strings on it.  It was huge and Delicious! My sister ordered a burger.  It was huge and she said it was juicy.  She is a growing 17 year old 5'9"" softball player and she was only able to finish her fries and 1/2 the burger.   I ended up ordering the mahi mahi tacos grilled.  The seasoning was a bit bland and the fish was sort of dry.  Probably should have gone with one of their signature dishes and left the tacos for a Mexican Restaurant but that's my fault. We also ordered two pizookies for desert.  The triple chocolate and the original.  I was against ordering the triple because I thought it would be too much chocolate.  Surprisingly it was really good.  Yes it was chocolaty but not too much.  And the original was just as yummy as its always been!  Everyone at the table agreed that choosing to order the pizookie at the table was a MUCH better idea than standing in the cold out side, in the block and a 1/2 line that was forming outside of Diddy Reese. As we left the manager gave us a genuine 'have an amazing night' and 'Happy Thanksgiving'.   All in all I would give this restaurant another try.  I still need to fill my stuffed potato craving anyway ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140,2.92,3.12,3.12,1.864,3.0400000000000005
56,Cindy T.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,19,6.0,1.0,2012-11-27,"One word: Terrible. Note: This is an extremely long review, and I apologize for all the space it takes up. If you don't feel like reading all of this (it really is quite tedious), let me just summarize for you: Don't ever eat here. The service is awful, the quality of the food is mediocre, and it's simply not worth the money and wait. For those who do want to read about my experience: I went to this particular BJ's for the first time for my birthday earlier this month, and I left feeling extremely disappointed. I've eaten at BJ's a couple times before (in my hometown of Elk Grove) so I had similar expectations for this location... And they were by no means met. We get there around 8 pm on a Saturday night, and there's a crowd of people outside waiting for a table, which is nothing out of the ordinary for a BJ's restaurant. The host said that the wait would be approximately 30-45 minutes, which we were fine with. Our group was composed of 5 people, so we figured we could keep each other entertained for a half hour. But what we COULDN'T do, however, is keep ourselves entertained for an hour and a half, which was the time we actually had to wait! Every time we went in to check our position, the host would apologize and tell us that we would be the next table seated! Horrible. We honestly should've left at this point but instead we decided to wait it out. We finally got our table, and were seated in the center of the room. The place was loud and packed with people, and it didn't help that the UCLA v. WSU game was on that night. Naturally, a friendly waitress came by, apologized for the wait, and handed us menus and took our orders. One of my friends and I got our own personal pizzas, while my other three friends decided to share a large. Someone also ordered a pizookie, and the waitress said she'd put in the order midway through the meal so that it'd arrive right when we finished eating. The wait for our food was ridiculous - it was 30 minutes! We asked our waiter (sometime during the wait we got a new server - I'm guessing the waitress ended her shift) how long it was going to take, and he kept on repeating that the pizza was nearly done and that the chefs just needed to put it on the plate... By that point we were ravenous. After about 20 minutes in I was getting impatient, and couldn't help myself from continuously glancing at the food that was laid out on the counter above the stoves. (You know, where the cooks place the food after it's done cooking and is ready to be served.) I noticed that there were several plates of food just sitting there for the last 10 minutes... And yup, you guessed it - when we finally got our food, one of those plates turned out to be my pizza. Needless to say, the pizza definitely did not live up to expectation. Even in the midst of my hunger I was definitely put off by the quality and taste, which was only average. It was soggy at the bottom and lukewarm everywhere else. I had to hold up the tip or else the toppings would fall off! We all finished our food in 10 minutes or less - you can imagine how hungry we were. One of my friends asked for a birthday pizookie for me, which arrived in about 10 minutes. However, my friend's pizookie never arrived! We notified our waiter, and he said that the order was never put in and that he'd get it started right away... Which meant more waiting.  We waited a bit more, but all the guys were starting to get pissed off (not surprisingly). We asked our waiter where the pizookie was, and he rudely responded and told us they were working on it. After 10 minutes passed, we decided that we'd rather just leave than wait for the pizooki. We called our waiter over and told him to cancel it, to which he replied sharply, ""You want to just cancel it? It's already made. It's almost here now. You can, but the cook is about to put it on the plate. He's probably putting it on the plate right now as we speak. You sure you want to cancel it? Because you can, but just know that it's pretty much done."" Wait, what? Did our waiter just give us attitude? We agreed to wait for the pizooki, but in our minds this was the last straw. There was no way in hell we were ever going here again. It came out a couple minutes later, but of course the warmth and sweetness of enjoying a warm ice cream topped pizookie had long evaporated.  Horrible place, horrible quality, horrible service. Everything was just horrible.

Coming here after hiking the Rustic Canyon trail, I ordered a grilled turkey burger within minutes of being seated immediately for a holiday lunch. Service was intermittent, and slow at points. The waitress also managed to spill water onto one of my friends, however, this was a mistake and quickly dismissed. However, what shocked me was their slow service during this holiday. I realize it may have been due to poor staffing, but after taking a look around there seemed to be quite a few staffers and folks in the kitchen. Furthermore, the restaurant was half full. It didn't make sense. When I received my burger, it was not piping hot as I had hoped. It was moderate in taste, and as you may suspect, it wasn't as tasty as a beef burger. Unlike a beef hamburger, the turkey burger was the healthier option.  I should have ordered a pizza, as they can be quite tasty here. I'll be back here for probably a UCLA event, hopefully not on too busy of a night as they tend to get packed here.

By that time I had already comforted and reassured my wife and son more than a dozen times that our food was coming, and to not lose heart its coming.

The last negative was that a manager opened the sliding glass panel next to us leading into the indoor dining area.

290,Jenn H.,"New York, NY",426,102,167.0,1.0,2013-05-28,"When I began working as an event coordinator at a neighboring university, colleagues suggested that BJ's Westwood always offered good catering service and food. Admittedly, my experience was pleasant for the first few times of communicating with the staff at BJ's.  Unfortunately, during our most recent luncheon, BJ's demonstrated the most unprofessional and disrespectful service. Here is a narration of the utterly infuriating experience.  On May 3, 2012, I placed an order on the phone with a BJ's staff, requesting a Friend's & Family meal for the following Monday. Usually, communicating with the staff at BJ's is fairly straightforward. Perhaps the person on the phone was having a rough day--he took a while to fully comprehend the order I'd like to place.  On the day of the luncheon (May 6, 2012), I received a call from BJ's around 40 min before the delivery time, asking me to place an order for another salad, for that the one I had originally ordered wasn't available. I hastily chose a salad and went to the conference room to prepare for the meeting. After much anticipation, the order was delivered around 12:10pm, which was a 25 min delay. Also, I noticed that the order was significantly smaller than what we have had before. Upon checking the receipt, all of the items were listed as ""Balsamic Chicken"", which hindered me from validating if we had gotten the correct order. As the delivery person left, we realized that plates and utensils were missing. Naturally, frustration grew in the conference room, as we have all been looking forward to eat lunch.  After 15 minutes of requesting plates to be delivered, we received them and everyone gobbled down the food. When the meeting was over, my boss informed me that BJ's had forgotten 2 large orders of salads, which were delivered 50 minutes later to the wrong location that happened to be the Chairman's office.  I called to ask to speak with a manager multiple times regarding the multiple mistakes that had occurred. During each phone call, I was either put on hold for a prolonged period of time, which led me to eventually ending the call, or that I was sent to speak with a manager who claimed to have no power to issue any monetary resolution for my case. Livid and insulted, I was discouraged to contact BJ's again.  Until last week, as I was walking by the eatery, I decided to step in and ask for the manager. When speaking with the manager, I was told that late deliveries were normal occurrences, suggesting that I should not have been dissatisfied because of the late order. I was baffled--What is the point of specifying a delivery time if it is meant to be delayed? Such poor work ethics is unheard of in my career.  Noticing the manager's nonchalance about my complaint, I proceeded to list the mistakes that BJ's had committed within one catering order. He then told me that the delivery person was faced with ""a door slammed in his face"" when he attempted to deliver the missing salads 50 minutes later. I was in the conference room during the luncheon, and I honestly did not witness such rudeness being performed. Bewildered by the manager's attitude, I recounted the importance of customer relations and asked for the manager's resolution. Ultimately, he offered two BJ's gift cards, which I gave to my boss when I returned to the office.  I do not dine at BJ's because of the greasy foods and large portions. After this series of flippant customer service, my personal preference has been reinforced. In addition, I do not recommend BJ's catering service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140,2.04,2.82,3.008,2.34,2.508

It's a good option for dining in Westwood, especially since a lot of other places in the area went out of business recently (so sad to see). You can count on BJ's for a fun meal. We like their Jeremiah Red draft beer (amber), their burgers (I used to love their classic burgers on a French garlic baguette - they don't have them in their menu anymore and the California one (with avocado) and my husband likes their BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Their fish and chips dish was OK, I had better and my husband wasn't thrilled with their battered shrimp - don't know if they still serve them. Sure, plenty of calories here, but from time to time it's OK to splurge. Service is usually good. It's a smaller location, I don't mind it, although I could do with less screens on the walls. And another minus, they don't have Happy Hour here! Recently we saw the ads w. their 2 for $20 deal. I called this location and they said they'll serve it till Nov. 11th. When we got in, the hostess didn't know if they still serve it, but they do. No adds around to let people know about it. You can get a small salad or a soup each, share a medium pizza and share a pizookie as desert for $19, 95. Not a bad deal.  I got their house salad, nothing great, just iceberg lettuce, 2 slices of cucumbers, 2 slices of tomatoes, shredded carrots and croutons. My husband got their tortilla soup, that was much better with chunks of avocados in it. He would have liked it hotter, but it was really good. We picked the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza (w. grilled garlic chicken, bacon, chopped tomatoes and onions, jack and cheddar cheese), it's plenty of it, took some leftovers at home. Very good, I enjoyed the crust, the fresh chopped tomatoes and red onions.  We picked the Triple Chocolate Ghirardelli Pizookie dessert and enjoyed it. Even if we ate at BJ's, many times before we never tried their desserts, their portions are so big that we never had room left for desert. So, if you're in the area, check it out, they have an extensive menu (besides pizza-s and burgers) and brew their beers, so they have a great selection. It's an OK place, nothing fancy.

First of all, I'm vegetarian and I must say that the BJs veggie patty is my favorite substitute veggie patty out of all the places I've tried. Island's is a close second, but this still takes the cake for me. The crispy jalapeño burger is by far my favorite, mostly because of the crispy jalapeños inside (i love anything fried) and also because the veggie patty doesn't taste like a lump of potatoes. I also found one of my favorite beers here, the PM porter. It's so creamy and chocolatey perfectly bitter. For Guinness lovers, it's almost like a creamy guinness double stout, or a sweeter oatmeal stout. If you're feeling something a little fruitier, the Black Velvet at BJs is also amazing. It's a berry cider mixed with the PM porter and it tastes like a dark chocolate cake with a tart raspberry dressing. Writing about it makes me want to go get one right now! The lighter beers are pretty good too (i'm not a huge fan of the amber and red ales), but I'd recommend the Blonde as well if you aren't a dark beer person.

286,Alex E.,"Encino, CA",216,62,122.0,5.0,2014-07-05,"I went here on the fourth of July and I love this place. Being that it was a holiday, it was not crowded at all so we got seated right away, which from what I understand is usually not the case. At the same time, they seemed to be short staffed because the service was slow, but I understand since it's Independence Day. I ordered a deep dish pizza and they accidentally brought out a thin crust. They replaced it with the thick crust without a charge, which was very nice. The great part was that I was able to try both. I certainly recommend the deep dish. The thin crust tastes like any old pizza but the deep dish is to die for. We got a large size so I had some left over that I ate the next day. We also had the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and it was delicious too. It came with some garlic bread which was really good too. But the best part was the dessert. If you go here, save room for a pizzookie, which is a pizza/cookie dessert. It has a nice warm cookie crust with ice cream on top. I think it is rated one of the best desserts in LA. This and Didi Reese across the street are amazing. We had the triple chocolate pizzokie, and if you like chocolate, you will love this one. It has a rich chocolate cookie that is unbelievable without being too rich. And to top it off it comes with double chocolate ice cream, which is chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips. I would go back in a heartbeat just for the dessert. The ambiance is great with lots of big screen TVs showing sports so it's a great place to watch a game if you like sports. Parking is difficult since it is in Westwood. There is no valet parking and the meters are usually full. We parked in the lot across the street, which was $ 6.50. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a place to hang out with friends and have some great pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140,2.88,2.67,2.928,2.7079999999999997,2.7539999999999996

I don't think I've ever had such an odd service experience as I did last night, I'm still thinking about it.  My friend and I popped into BJs in Westwood after seeing a movie nearby.  Our waitress Marissa seemed weird to begin with but whatever.  But then, we experienced firsthand that her service was also weird.  Important to note is that the waiter station where the waiters put their orders into the computer was literally three feet from our booth.   Marissa delivered our food and stepped aside the couple of feet over to the waiter station to do something on the computer.  In the same moment that she delivered our food, we realized that she had never brought us any place settings/utensils, so we could not eat our food.  As mentioned, we noticed this pretty much right when she brought us our food but she had slid behind the waiter station before asking if we needed anything else/before we had the chance to tell her we needed something else.  We immediately said ""excuse me"" noting that we needed something right away before we could start eating, however, Marissa continued looking at her computer and told us to ""hold on.""  So we sat there for several seconds unable to eat our food until another server asked what we needed and got us utensils. The next major weird incident was when we went to pay.  Marissa brought us our bill and my friend put her credit card in with our check and handed it to Marissa -- forgetting to get my credit card so we could split it.  Marissa turned to her computer to run the credit card but, just then, before she even started, I handed her my card and asked her to please split the bill.  Marissa (again with keeping her eyes on the computer and refusing to give me eye contact) said, ""Sorry, I just use the first card that is given to me and REFUSED to take my card - I was really confused by this.  My friend ended up paying for our whole meal since Marissa wouldn't LET ME split it with her.  We mentioned these odd occurrences to the manager and he was pretty apathetic about it.  Weird and safe to say I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140,2.64,2.59,2.924,2.468,2.6100000000000003

Perhaps my tolerance level for horrendous service has lowered as I get older, or we were unlucky to be stuck with a miserable waitress, but I won't be returning to this location. Granted the food was expected, but the service left a very bad taste in our mouths.  We went during the Christmas break, so the UCLA kids were out, we found parking outside, the restaurant was only about 30% full. We were seated at a booth, almost immediately. All good start.  Then it went downhill from there, there was no redeeming the evening. Our waitress (Kathy i think was her name) has got to be the most miserable waitress we've ever had the pleasure interacting, in our years of dining out. She clearly didn't want to be there and seemed to have a personal hostility against us. We asked for water and iced tea. We didn't get them until the appetizer came (she never even walked by, so we had to flag another waiter who brought our drinks for us). She didn't drop off the appetizer (someone else from the kitchen brought out our Carnitas Fries and Chile Verde). The fries were good, and the chile verde tangy, tart, a bit spicy. No problem with the food. The main courses came out - deep dish BBQ chicken pizza and Jambalaya- this time carried over by another gentleman, who also ended up removing the appetizer plate. He asked us how it was, and for us to enjoy the entrees. By this time, our drinks were empty, but our waitress hasn't once come back to check up on us. In the meantime, she has refilled drinks for the other patrons around us. At this point I got self conscious and started thinking if she was maybe not fond of Asians (moi). But she works by UCLA for god's sakes, and not Podunk, Ohio, so Asians are not uncommon.  The host refilled our drinks for us, he also asked how we found the food. Both were dishes we've had before and so we liked them fine. The jambalaya this evening was a couple notches spicier than other times, and they sprinkled chipotle peppers all around the plate, so it was rather intrusive (good for presentation, I guess).  We managed to flag her down for our 3rd round of refill, at which point,we wanted the remaining half of the pizza to go and asked for our check. She didn't bother asking how the food went, etc. This is the kicker: she had the audacity to smile so widely when dropping off the check, and on it, was a big hand-drawn smiley face, a ""Thanks"" and her name. Unreal. We gave her a 15% tip in cash and took off. I'd have given less but it was the holidays, and i didn't want to be chased down for what she'd definitely argue to be great service. Her negative energy tells me she'd stoop that low.  Management needs to get a better handle on who they hire, but with the place being constantly busy when school is in, and their ""who cares if our service sucks, these kids only care about their beers"" attitude, i guess they don't feel the need to try at all. I've had way better service at iHop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=160,2.72,2.65,2.932,2.18,2.678

34,Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,315,569.0,4.0,2015-03-22,"I'm going to give it a four for MY experience but in terms of food definitely a 3. As always we start with parking! Read yelp and basically discovered parking is horrendous, but to my surprise it's not AS bad as you would think. It's not a private lot so you're going to end up paying but like most people said it's a flat rate after 6 or by the hour in lots/garages during the day. You can also do meters but if you think you're gonna stay longer than 2 hours might be better not to.  I went before 6 on a Saturday and found a small lot right behind Whole Foods that cost 5 bucks. There was a parking garage across the street that was 3 bucks flat after 6. There's a lot more garages than I expected. But honestly if I can just find parking relatively close to my location I'm pretty dang happy.  I joined 3 other ladies that night and for the most part enjoyed it. Company definitely makes up for lack of food quality.   This was my first time at this location and I kind of enjoyed being on the top floor, it felt a bit more intimate for us.  The food was okay to me. I got a pasta instead of a pizza for the first time and it was meh...  I'm a die hard deep dish fan and actually really enjoy those pizzas but I decided to try the chicken Alfredo.  It was okay. I just wasn't blown away, there wasn't anything great about the sauce or the chicken, but I was content.   Service was okay. Nice guy. Got switched to a woman half way, wasn't as great but wouldn't complain that much. Now the reason I say 4 stars for us, or else this would be a basic 3 star review, is because we ordered 2 pizookies. One came out fine but the other took so long that our friends had already eaten theirs. Turns out the order was made incorrectly twice, but the chef came out to our table personally apologized for the mistake and said the pizookie was on the house. Now that was good service for an honest mistake.  I know people have talked about bad service but for the most part it was an enjoyable pleasant night. Will I come back to this location? It's a maybe. But still not a bad night! P. S salted caramel pizookie didn't live up to the expectations I had, was way too salty for my taste buds. You may like the sweet and salty thing but it was too overpowering for me unfortunately.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=60,2.76,2.72,2.936,2.512,2.736

Normally I think that BJs is a little better than it's direct competitors. However the BJs in in Westwood is not up to snuff with other BJs. It's smaller, and the service was not nearly as good. It seems like they were trying real hard, but with the NBA game on it took us FOREVER to get a table. The food took a long time to come out. Some people got the wrong dishes, some people had cold food. It seemed like they were having a real rough night.  I got a french dip and it was okay. I wish there was not globs of aoli on it because it kinda took over, and the fries were cold, but aside from that it was okay. Just a tad more than I wish I would have paid.

It is sometimes lacking, but generally our server is on top of it enough so that we have a pleasant experience. Our server yesterday was good. He took my husband's allergy to onions and garlic seriously. He refilled drinks when they were low. He manicured unwanted or items that were finished off of the table. He was very good.

I must say, however, your UCLA Westwood branch needs a good whipping! First, the greeter, who seamed to mean well, did not even know if the BJ beers were brewed on premises, nor did he express any sincere interest in the subject, I could tell from the way he promoted the ""session IPA"". My wife and I ordered beer. My wife's nut brown was OK, but my ""Imperial Stout"" was poor example. It had a malty sweetness in the beginning, but was insipid. It had a good amount of alcahol though. It was either an attempt not to ""scare"" the customer, a brew by people who don't know/ like the style. Or a first attempt at brewing the beer on a system that the brewers had not yet found little ways to adopt there existing equipment to, or scimping on ingredients. Second, my wife's Bacon Cheese Burger arrived first but very room temp! The french fries were shreds and not conventional as she ordered! Later my wife told me there was a long black hair in it, so she had to attempt to sterilize her pallet with beer and wash her mouth out!!!!!! Third my pizza was horrible!!! I specifically ordered the 15$ deep dish brewhouse, not the 20$!!! It was just above warm, and really under cooked, the vegetables were raw, the cheese and pepperoni were not caramelized and the ""sausages"" were little flavorless prepackaged crumbles (soy!?!) !! It reminded me of some wishy washy limp wristed  vegan pizza that the cook was trying to doctor up to please complaining omnivores!!!!  I lived in Chicago for a whole year and never had a piece of crap like that!

So after being turned away at a nearby closed California Pizza Kitchen, I decided to try BJ's. This place was busy and we were quickly seated. Only a three or four minute wait and our server arrived to take our drink order.  When our drinks arrived we ordered and we were off to a great start. We ordered flat bread nachos for an appetizer. My salad arrived in a timely manner. Then 15 min later our dinner. This is where everything went down hill. My baked potato was overcooked. It was brown on the inside. It had a smokey taste. I was confused. Was it supposed to be brown? Surely the cooks would not send this out like this. It was cut open by the cook. He would have seen it. The server confirmed it was burnt and she offered another side. I had already finished my steak. Which was also overcooked. I had to keep adding A-1 sauce to the steak to moisten it up so I could eat it. I didn't want to complain to the server because she was very busy and I didn't want my friends to feel uncomfortable about me complaining again. We finished up and asked for our check and then out of the blue our flat bread nachos arrived. Of course we turned them away and were told we wouldn't be charged for them. All I asked for was some kind of discount for the burnt  baked potato. The server said i could have a free desert in its place. So I ordered the three cookie ice cream plate. But after 15 long minutes it hadn't arrived. We asked for our check. 10 minutes later no check yet but our  ice cream did arrive.   I said I didn't want it anymore and I asked for my check again.  I just wanted to leave. I was tired of waiting. The server said she would give us the desert and take it off our check. (It was supposed to be free) On our check the appetizer read ""free"" which we never received and turned away and our desert was taken off the ticket. Wow. What a bad experience. I still did not get credit for my baked potato. My friends wanted to leave a small tip but I insisted on a 15% tip to the server. I usually leave 20% tips. I don't think she was to blame for the under staffing and the terrible cooks. She was really trying. I am sure other patrons left her little to no tips because of mismanagement here at this location.

My food came in earlier and our server apologized because she put in the wrong order and they made the wrong pizza therefore we had to wait a little more. Which was completely fine! She was very upset and constantly apologized, gave us free garlic bread, and said that dessert was on her, which was a very sweet offer. I understand, because I'm a waitress myself and do make similar mistakes, therefore we were very patient with our orders and the service we were receiving.

But, their food isn't the kind that makes you want to come back a second time. The flavours are unmemorable and the variety of food that they serve can be found at a multitude of other similar style restaurants.  They do have one saving grace though...the PIZOOKIE. It's a cookie cooked in a little pizza pan that is served with ice cream on top. I got the monkey bread pizookie, which tasted like a cinnamon roll and was fluffy with caramelized edges that blended perfectly with the vanilla ice cream on top. I would definitely recommend monkey bread over other more traditional flavours like salted caramel, cookies and cream, etc. though those are great too.

It's the go-to place in Westwood when you want to make a totally vanilla choice that will not offend anybody's taste buds, yet it doesn't really say anything at all of worth.  Its menu of everything from salads to burgers to jambalaya (which I like the most yet is the most expensive at around $18) is so expertly crafted such that any goer simply cannot say, ""oh, I can't eat anything here."" And yet, when the food comes out, it's so un-noteworthy.  You know how when you go to a restaurant and then the dish someone ordered finally hits the table and then everyone goes up in a chorus of ""Oooohhh that looks goooodddd""? Yeah, I have never heard that at BJ's. It's usually just a nod for acknowledgment of receipt. That said, I mean, the beers on tap here are kind of cool--but again, not very noteworthy.

My husband let her know that the guy we had asked did not help us at all and just went to so stand there doing nothing.. then we finally got a hold of our new waitress and asked her if the waitress before her had charged us for a pint or a pitcher because we had ordered a pitcher.. she went to go check and said she had only charged  for a pint that she would win that.. then she came back with a full pitcher, which my husband told her she shouldn't have filled it up since he had the pint already.. she said that was the least she could do so we thanked her.. ask my husband starts pouring himself his beer from the pitcher he said I just saw something come out of the pitcher then he waited for the foam in the glass of beer to settle the say that indeed something was in it.. a piece of pepperoni! Disgusting! We didn't even order anything with pepperoni!  We then got a hold of the our waitress and let her know what had happened and just told her not to bring us any more beer at all.. this was the worse experience i have ever had in a BJ'S restaurant. .On the plus side the food we ordered was delicious, too bad for the rest..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=80,2.68,2.76,2.764,2.536,2.728

119,Ishita G.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,15,1.0,3.0,2017-07-27,"BJ's is extremely average food-wise. The burgers are always have disproportionate condiments, the fries are flailing, and the deep-dish pizza is also quite average. The nacho pizza is above average (pretty good), and they have a good selection of beers, though. The brunch pancakes are also fat and mealy. All in all, the food is just about okay. But the pizookie is just amazing, they have a lot of variety in pizookies, the big one is good to share between two people, and the mini-pizookie is easily finished by one. My personal favorite is the macadamia nut and white chocolate. People should honestly ditch Diddy Riese and stick to BJ's pizookies. The place always has tons of seating, the servers are always sweet and chirpy, overall pretty good vibe for a late night snack, but there's very few things you could truly like on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood,2.92,2.78,2.752,,2.836
107,Rana S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",43,135,727.0,2.0,2017-07-30,"Gosh. Honestly we should have just had the pizzoki (sp?) and left. I haven't been to BJs in for we and today reminded me why. With the exception of the cool architecture,  lighting, and sports (although nothing interesting was on) this place is less than average.  We went around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch. The place was pretty empty. I think there must have been a total of 6 or 7 tables occupied but the place was full of employees all running around seemingly to know where. You know where everyone plays busy, that was the case here.  We were seated at a booth in the main bar area which was great for tv watching- although, like I said, nothing interesting to follow.  We were first approached by a waitress who took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order- we literally had just been seated. Odd. Anyways she left. A second person brought out our drinks. Then a third employee came and introduced himself as our waiter. So confusing.  Anyways we ordered a spinach artichoke dip to start; a Mediterranean deep dish; some chicken wings; and a salad. The food is SO EXCESSIVELY SALTY. All of it. I am not exaggerating. All the food: from the dip to the pizza and chicken wings. All of it was so salty. If you have blood pressure issues, be careful here.  The dip was the highlight. It was the least salty. The chicken, which is called a siracha something chicken wing, and it tasted like vinegar. The pizza was really just a deep pan of bread, with a little bit of pesto, some salty chicken cubes and kalamata olives. All salty and just not fresh. They assemble food. Don't cook good. The salad was also good. It was quite healthy but the blueberries in it were not fresh. The food was just meh at best. Honestly we didn't enjoy any of it.  Then, I took the girls to the restroom and had my partner ask for ranch. We came back and the ranch hadn't been right out. Of course at this pint we are the waiter just walking back and forth, with determination.i didn't see him doing anything that would take time away from a cup of ranch, but nonetheless it took him a good 15 minutes to bring the ranch.  Anyways it wasn't our best meal. I am convinced the salt amount could cause a heart attack. It was out of control. We probably won't be returning.  *Yelp 100 Challenge-2017*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood,2.92,2.75,2.752,,2.8179999999999996

Second time we went there for birthday celebration and it was a surprise for BD boy. Upon our arrival we secretly told them to bring a cake after our food and surprise the guy but here is what happened: We ordered our food as always and asked for drinks, the drinks came out really late almost with the food, we needed to ask our server to fill out our waters but it seemed he didn't care. We even told him we're gonna drink a lot of water in a funny way to have his attention but didn't work! We were still working on our food and they brought us the check without even asking if we wanna have dessert or not and the server totally forgot about the birthday boy!!  We told the guy who bring us the check to talk to our server but he said he's already gone!! Without even notifying us. At the end they ruined the surprise birthday and we had an awful dinner! I will definitely not gonna be back in this BJ's and recommend everyone to try other locations. Anything would be better than this trashy restaurant.

Why they would choose carpet at this location is beyond me. Left extremely dissatisfied, felt like a waste of time and money. If I could give this place negative stars I would.

When I walked in yesterday around lunch time, the place was surprisingly empty, it was only me and two other patrons during the time I was there eating, but I took the assumption that everyone was in class and would be coming in later, I typically come here at night, but I guess the afternoon holds a different crowd for BJs. I sat down and was approached by the waiter (who actually didn't tell me his name... shame... he was really good.) and he handled my selection of food well and responded back quickly with anything I needed. I assumed this was because of the lack of patrons in the restaurant, but I wasn't complaining with the quick service. I only ordered the classic BJs burger and added bacon onto to it so I can push myself over the $10 threshold to get a free Pizookie, and the burger was extremely satisfying and the fries were at a satisfying level. The Pizookie was just the icing on the cake of my visit, not because it was free, but because it's a staple of the BJs restaurants all around. I had a quick in-and-out experience with this place which was fine because that's what I needed because I had class a few hours afterwards and I wanted my Pizookie fix. I really wish I got my waiter's name because although with an empty restaurant, he was very attentive and looked like he cared about the people he serves.

I work for Doordash and I was simply coming to pick up an order and she was the hostess at the front. When I came in she already had a seemingly mean look on her face, and then I said ""Hi, I'm here to pick up an order for Doordash"" and she replied with an attitude that she hasn't received the order yet and that she's been having issues all day with them. She seemed to be getting mad at me for just being there... Anyways, I contact doordash about the issue and they call her to configure it... I go back in to ask if she finally has gotten the order and she says (in a rude away again) and seems very annoyed with me, that she just got it, so I ask how long does she think it might take since I'm delIvering food and I don't want my customer to be upset... And she replies in a very mean way ""I don't know that because I literally just put in the order and if you could just wait over there please"" so at this point I ask her to not give me attitude and that I'm just doing my job... She continued to be even more rude and asked for my name, so I asked her for her name and if I could speak to a manager. She let me know that SHE was the manager and I was very surprised to hear this because I felt very disrespected and for a manager this was TERRIBLE customer service, even if I'm not eating here and just picking up an order. So, now as I am waiting for the food to be ready (which is also taking forever), I am writing this. Please have a word with this manager Kimberly. She made my visit here very unpleasant.
