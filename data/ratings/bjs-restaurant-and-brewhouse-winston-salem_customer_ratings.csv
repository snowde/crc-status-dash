75,Stephanie A.,"Winston-Salem, NC",134,221,592.0,5.0,2016-03-18,"Wow is all I can say about this new brewhouse that opened in the Hanes Mall parking lot! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted and seated by extremely friendly staff. I love the high, industrial ceilings with brushed stainless accents and Edison bulbs for lighting! The back wall has their list of craft beers which is great and easy to see even from the far side of the dining area. We had a wonderful server, Hope, who had a great personality but also wasn't afraid to ask for help since they just opened this week. I can appreciate that so much more than someone I winging it. I tasted their Jeremiah Red beer and it reminded me of a Killian's which would be great except I was ordering seafood for dinner. I ended up getting their Harvest Hefeweizen which had a Bavarian beer profile with banana hints and citrus. It went amazingly with the seafood and was very refreshing! I ordered the Roasted Salmon which was a huge serving of salmon that had been perfectly roasted with light seasonings and was still moist! It was on top of roasted mixed vegetables of asparagus, red peppers, and mushrooms with perfectly cooked quinoa. Better than seafood I've had at the beach! I can't wait to return soon! You can download their free app and earn points with each purchase, get call ahead seating, have them start your order before you arrive and even pay for your check!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=60,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002

32,Chris W.,"Wheeling, IL",26,278,74.0,3.0,2016-03-21,"Let me start off by saying I REALLY like this restaurant chain, some of the best food around. Having lived on the west coast for several years I have been to several BJs before and I love their beers and pizzas. When I saw they were opening in Winston I was stoked! So of course we went. So here goes the review.. I called ahead and put our name down with the a 6:50 table seating time. Arrived promptly at 6:50 and proceeded to wait an additional 15 minutes before being seated... Strike one, I hate waiting in the restaurant when our table should be ready. Moving on, i figure they are just busy and we get seated. Comfy booth with a great atmosphere. Completely the way I remember it back home and I feel like I am back on the west. But.. where is our waiter? 5 minutes go by... Finally a greeting and I will be right with you. We order our waters...crickets...  25 minutes later we get our waters. I kid you not... I timed it.  Strike 2....What could possibly take someone 25 minutes to get two waters from the bar? I was just about to go to the bar and get our drinks ourselves. Whatever, we got our waters but still no beer.  We order our meals shortly after our waters, luckily the salads came at a reasonable time. But AFTER we ordered wings as an appetizer we are told they are OUT of wings. How is a restaurant that been open a week out of something?! Wouldn't you have excess stock of everything? I guess not. But the part that annoyed me was that I was not told until well after I ordered them. They should come out with the salads... Still no beer...Strike 3. So they say we can order another appetizer on the house, but I don't really want anything else... ended up ordering sliders... Beer finally came though. Whatever, the salads are delicious and exactly as I remember them. Our pizza, a deep dish style comes out BEFORE the sliders, how is that even possible. We are literally done with our meal and the sliders are delivered to our table. Apparently our original order went to the wrong table.  At this point I am out of strikes. Bottom line the food is incredible, it really is. The pizza is cooked perfectly and is a great substitute for those from Chicago. The wings (which they were out of) are usually amazing and they have some phenomenal drinks. I especially like the Piranha and was very excited to order one again.  The manager did apologize for the hiccups in service, but if I am paying for something, I expect it to be worthwhile and spending 2 hours for dinner when I am waiting half the time for my orders... is a waste of my time as a paying customer. Hopefully they fix their service blunders as I really do like the restaurant. I'll give them another shot in a month or so and see if they have gotten better.  In the meantime, make sure to sign up for their rewards card and newsletter for discounts and free stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
88,Natalie N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",105,77,15.0,1.0,2016-03-24,"If I could give B.J.'s a lower rating, I would. My BF and I came into the restaurant mid-afternoon on Wednesday to check the place out. We had a seat at the Bar and when were begruddingly ""greeted"" by the bartender, I asked if there were any specials. She quickly replied ""No,"" and slid a couple of bar menus in our direction. Without opening the menu, by BF asked for a Michelob Ultra, and I asked for the same. Bartender: ""We don't have that. The equivalent would be B.J.'s ______ Brew."" So we both ordered that. She never checked back with us about how liked The B.J.'s ______ Brew, and while we were sitting there checking out the menu and looking around the restaurant, we noticed a board marked ""Specials"" to the right of the Bar. The bartender was either ill informed about the Specials for that day, or purposely sold us a couple of drinks that cost twice as much as what was advertised on her Specials board. It was obvious we were new patrons to the restaurant (as most would be since this place is new to Winston Salem) and she walked by us multiple times without checking on the brew she recommended or engaging us in the new restaurant concept. To add insult, to injury, she charged by BF's credit card for the tab twice. There is no doubt there are some kinks to be worked out any any new restaurant, but these ""missteps"" are the ABC's of employee training/education. There are a million places to eat in the B.J.'s vicinity, and hopefully people make this place work harder for their business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=80,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
89,Emily L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-29,"My first experience was not impressive.  The food is overpriced for the area.  I ordered a soup/salad combo- only 8.25 (which was almost the cheapest thing on the menu) and it was very small in size.  I left hungry.  The food was good, but not enough.   We walked in & was asked by hostess if we were in the BJ Loyalty Club - ""No"" this was our first time walking in the door.  The hostess didn't bother to tell us anymore.  Just asked us if the booth by the bar would be ok.   Our server made the experience worse.  We waited about 10 minutes before the server ever even came & spoke to us & when she did all she said was I'll be right back- that was 5 minutes later. She came, didn't explain anything out the history of BJ's or the custom made sodas or specials.  We overheard the server at the table beside of us explain in detail all of this.   I asked for my soup & salad to come out together with the rest of the tables food. Instead my soup came out way early by another server or food runner & I asked her to take it back so I could eat with the others.  When the others food came out delivered another server only my salad came out this time, with the wrong dressing.  Our server was busy with the table beside of us, but yet failed to come ask us when she was free if everything was ok w/our food.  I had to go get the manager to get them to correct my order.  Manager quickly corrected everything. Server brought my water refill after I had been empty for sometime & I had asked her for a refill.  We got our own to go boxes.  Seemed like everyone Except our server was waiting on us.  They did have 1/2 off deep dish pizzas - this was only good thing I can say & the food was pretty tasty.  They need to get better employees that actually learn about the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=80,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
30,Quijana B.,"Silver Spring, MD",408,478,4022.0,4.0,2016-04-02,"This is the second time in one week that I've visited a brand new restaurant. This one has the advantage of being a tried and true chain, so the menus are set, the staff has been rigorously trained, and all that has to happen for them to succeed is to open their doors.  I've only visited one other BJ's location. We didn't love it, but it was enough for us to take notice when we saw one while we traveled this week. The space is open and inviting, if a bit loud, and the menu had enough variety to make all of us happy. My boy had been craving steak until he spotted the spaghetti and meatballs. It was a huge amount of pasta and five somewhat under spiced meatballs, and could have easily been shared. The dish was bland until he doctored it up with Parmesan and hot pepper flakes. (Thank you to restaurants that have them on hand!) even better, our excellent waitress (hey, Lolia!) brought us a small dish of roasted garlic chunks. In all honesty, we all dove into that small dish of savory gold, and all of our meals were improved.  I ordered a small salad and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were perfect. Burnt and crispy on the edge and still firm on the inside. The sauce was not overbearing and gave the sprouts a nice bite (improved by the occasional bit of garlic!) and they were just what I've needed after a week of traveling. My husband's seared ahi salad was a riot of flavor. The ahi itself was almost without taste, but he stirred it into the main body of his salad and dealt with the reality that we are far from the ocean in which it made its home. We'd had the same experience with the ahi poke, which desperately needed sesame oil. One day we will learn not to order ahi unless we are in a place that focuses on fish.  Still, I have a feeling that this will be a welcome addition to the chain of chain restaurants that circle the mall here. We stopped overnight while traveling, but would eat here again if we were in the area. And we will ask to be seated in Lolia's section, because her smile and warm personality were enough on their own to move this from a 3.5 to a 4 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
51,James S.,"Graham, NC",4,238,216.0,1.0,2016-04-02,"Recently opened and boy was I looking forward to this place. Located in the Haynes Mall parking lot. This place sux beyond belief. Everything was wrong from the time I entered the door until I finally had enough and walked out, without eating. I checked in online, which was useless. It takes me about 30 minutes to get here so that is plenty of time. After I get there I still have to sit and wait for everybody else to get seated before I get seated. So online check in is a joke.  Next, just like other reviewers have stated the service is slow. It is beyond slow. It took me about 20 minutes to get a drink. I ordered an appetizer, which came out wrong. My drink was wrong.  So all of that had to be sent back and took even longer to get right. After being in the restaurant for just over an hour my food finally came out. A burger, which cost $11.25, was tiny, didnt even cover the bun and was completely burnt. Cooked down with hard black edges, like a piece of charcoal. Absolutely disgusting. I took 1 bite and asked for the manager. He finally wondered his way out and was a complete tool. He offered to replace it or get me something else. But that was it. I would still have to pay, and the long wait for it to be cooked. He was very condescending, arrogant, and just did not care. So I sent the burger back and told him to take it off of my bill. I didnt want anything. I got up and walked out. The service here is so bad. You can get better food and service at the popular fast food restaurant, also located in the mall parking lot.   The people here do not care. They are all clueless and do not care about the customer. The absolute worst. Beer is average at best. With the horrible service, and nasty food, there is no reason to eat here. I will never be back to this place.

31,Wendall H.,"Silver Spring, MD",204,129,598.0,4.0,2016-04-03,"What a great performance by a restaurant that has been open for two weeks! It is hard to have all of the hidden parts moving smoothly when you are welcoming new customers to your new establishment. But, they succeeded spectacularly! The hosts were nice, friendly, and working the waiting crowd. The ""wait"" did not seem long either. And, YES, there was a wait. It. Went. Fast. Tables were sat on the left; on the right; and in the center. The tables were vacated; cleaned; set; and ready to go.  Our waitress was fabulous! She was friendly, knowledgeable, and overflowing with charm.  My only true criticism was the food. It was good, but it lacked an element of personal character. There are cooks that can reproduce a menu item from a tried and true formula. Then there are the chefs that will create, with repeated excellence, that dish that is listed on the menu. While their cooks are good, I cannot place them in the chef category based on this visit. The meatballs in my son's spaghetti and meatballs were bland. My seared ahi salad had components that were packed with flavor, all except the ahi. It was really surprising to find the ahi lacking.  It wasn't bad, just bland in comparison.  The worse part of the entire evening was that I was traveling through the area. BJ's is the type of place that you want to keep coming back to, because you just know that they will keep getting better and better.  Side Note: I did not sit at the bar. I do not know how the service is. I have not experienced the expertise of their bartenders. I can only say that there were multiple TVs up top. There was a huge selection of alcohol. And, everyone was smiling. Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
52,Abby C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",17,77,37.0,2.0,2016-04-10,"I was really looking forward to trying this new place out and really wanted to write a better review, but for us the cons outweighed the pros. With call ahead seating, we were sat quickly and the beer and food were good (though I will say the beer was somewhat expensive compared to other places in the area). The menu itself was huge and they had a wide variety of food from pizza to seafood dishes and everything in between. However, after we were sat, our experience quickly went downhill.  Our server, while friendly enough, was not very efficient and after putting in a large appetizer order, we waited for a very long time. Once our entrees showed up, we asked where our appetizer was, and he basically said, ""My bad. I didn't put it in."" At this point, it seemed senseless to have them bring it out, so we canceled the appetizer order. In the meantime, one person in our group didn't get her entree because they dropped it on the floor, so she had to wait over 15 minutes to get a new meal while the rest of us finished our food. It also seemed like there was always someone different bringing us food/drinks...never the same person. Finally once the bills were brought out, they charged us for desserts that were supposed to be comped, and charged our friends for one of their meals twice, so we had to get that all sorted out.  Overall, the food and drinks were good and I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant itself, so had our experience not been so poor, I would probably give this restaurant a 4-star review. However, the forgotten appetizer, the dropped food (I understand accidents happen, but it definitely didn't help matters), the messed up bill, and the seemingly unconcerned server (not to mention we never had a manager come out to table touch and apologize for anything) dropped it down to two stars. I do know this place is pretty much brand spanking new and they are going to have bumps in the road and need to find their rhythm, so I can't say I won't be back...but it may be way down the line after they have established themselves a bit more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=40,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
10,Amy O.,"Winston-Salem, NC",41,51,33.0,5.0,2016-04-11,"I have wanted to try BJ's since I lived in California and constantly saw the advertising on my TV. The closest BJs was about 2hrs away so I never went. I was super excited when I saw one was opening right down the street. My friend and I went on a Saturday evening the weekend after they opened. We were given a 25-35minute wait....not bad for 6pm on a Saturday. The one thing I really like, is that we weren't forced to wait in the overly crowded lobby, or stand in the drizzle. I left my phone number and we received a text when our table was ready. We waited in the car, warm, uncrowded and we chose the music. We were lead to a cozy small 2 top booth in the corner. My only complaint was it was SO COLD. Maybe it was because we were directly under a vent, I'm not sure. I had to get our jackets from the car...thank goodness I had one, I wouldn't have been comfortable without it. Upon looking at the vast menu we decided to skip an appetizer so we would have room for dessert. I wanted a Pazzooki so badly. I ended up ordering the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were AMAZING. I didn't even realize that they were on the Lighter Choice menu. The side that accompanied them was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I wish I could find the recipe and make it at home. My friend ordered chicken fettuccine. It was really good. She said it was some of the best. We both actually ate our whole meals, which doesn't usually happen. In my opinion it's a huge compliment to the chef. Unfortunately, due to being so cold and uncomfortable we chose to leave without dessert. We will go back in another night for the Pazzooki sampler trio thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=20,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003
82,Meghan W.,"Clemmons, NC",0,3,,2.0,2016-04-29,"Two stars might be a stretch, but I'll give one star because the beer was good. And another star because the food was ok. this restaurant has the potential to be a great brew house and is not. I know it opened recently so I'm trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it took us 25 mins to get our beer. It wasn't busy so there's no excuse. Then one of our meals got messed up.

Everything from the service to some of the food choices were not good so disappointed we were comped our meal given  gift cards to come back to please try it again and we did we were there for two and a half hours on a weekday waiting on food or waitress she was apologetic and she was very good at her job but it didn't make up for the time the food took. We all decided that it wasn't a place we come back to again after 3 tries you just don't want to do it anymore I just don't have 2 1/2 hrs  to wait for a meal.

We invited friends to come the second time, the service , food and wait time was terrible. The food took over 2 hour's. The food was not the same as the first time, over cooked and less flavor. The staff unable to answer questions. The manager comped dinner and gave 25$ gift card.  We came back a month later still the same, 2 hour wait , food not prepared correctly, wrong order's, however the waitress was awesome. This restaurant needs proper training for staff, cooks , waitresses , and managers. The manager the night of the 25 th needs to know how to run staff and be more personable with customers.

29,Lisa C.,"Charlotte, NC",232,283,412.0,4.0,2016-05-02,"A sad fact about moving to NC was that I thought I would never have a pizookie again. So when I heard one of my favorite home town chains opened up a mere hour and a half away (compared to a flight back to CA) I had to make the pilgrimage.  One of the advantages of being an adult is that I could now try their beers, though the root beer is delicious if you don't imbibe. Of the flight sample I got I liked the berry cider the best. I was tempted to try one of each since I wasn't old enough to drink when I came here growing up but decided 11am on a Saturday wasn't the right time to throw it back like that even if I wasn't driving. If you come here you have got to try their deep dish pizza. It is a California take on a Chicago classic. A childish habit I never really grew out of was to leave the pizza crust uneaten because after all that cheesy saucy goodness how can plain crust compare? If you fry it of course. I happily eat the pizza crust here. As tempting as it was to add a salad or try an app I did not because the feature of the meal was yet to come. I eagerly ordered the cookies n' cream pizookie and waited an eternity for it. It has probably been seven years since I last had it and every mouthful was worth the drive. The chocolate cookie bottom of the pizookie came out warm and gooy to contrast perfectly with the melting ice-cream on top. I love the oreo whipped cream dollop on top that brings the other two flavors together expertly.  Obviously I am pretty jazzed about this place. The only flaw was that the service was pretty slow (over an hour for lunch). Other yelpers will want to take that into consideration and that the waitress was friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
6,Sean B.,"Clemmons, NC",14,131,155.0,2.0,2016-05-02,"I have to say that was one of the biggest and most complex menus I've seen in a long time. I honestly had a hard time finding something because it was so busy with ton of info.  The first thing you figure out this is more of a bar. The first, and I don't think I am off by many 5-6 pages is drinks. So once you finally get to the grub the next thing that jumps out at you are the prices. They are a little in the high side.  We went at lunch and were seated right away. I'm guessing at first the long wait for the waiter was because of the novel I have for a menu. When he finally showed up he was very friendly.  We asked for suggestions, as they had pizza, burgers, steak, fish, and we had I clue what to order. He suggested the  Sriracha Queso Dip, and root bar rib appetizer. Now when you hear Sriracha you thinking some heat, nope none, and hardly any flavor. The chips are very much like the kind you get at chili's. After we had finished we found out it was supposed to have a chili on it. We saw this when we got the bill and the did comp it.  The ribs, they had an amazing glaze, but not much flavor. However, unlike the Queso, it had some heat.  However there was hardly any meat on the bone, and it was fairly tough.  The sad thing the best thing there was the handcrafted draft soda. The were super cool, and so smooth.

We had already had dinner earlier that evening so we stopped by anyway to check out the bar area. So this review is only for the bar. There is a full bar with lots of wine and beer selections. In fact they make their own beer and I tried the Irish Style Jeremiah Red. It was good, not great but good. After perusing the menu we opted for a dessert also. We opted for the BJ's Baked Beignet, The menu describes it as ""Our delicious bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream."" And while it looks huge and heavy, it is certainly light and fluffy and a really nice option.

I told her what I liked in beer and she recommended a great beer.  Beers were priced a little high for my liking. $7 a pop. Would have given 4 stars if the beers were $5 a glass.

5,Karen S.,"Kernersville, NC",218,408,571.0,3.0,2016-05-29,"Bumped up a star solely based on the awesome service we received from Lolia H in the bar area. She was extremely knowledgable about all the beers as well as on top of all the menu items- and the menu is huge!!  She was personable and charming. Again, we all enjoyed our food- we especially liked the root beer glazed boneless wings (appetizer) as well as the avocado egg rolls( also appetizer) The deep dish pizza continues to be one of the best items on the menu.  Service this time was awesome but we just can't seem to wrap our heads around the $6 beers... Dinner for 3 was over $90 and I sadly wasn't even drinking.... Going back over our check the next day, while we had asked for the 2 for $25 deal, we were charged separately for those items, bringing the total to $30 and not getting our free dessert  I did not realize this until the next day...

We decided to go off of an recommendation after a pre-K graduation on a Thursday Evening. We were seated immediately. Our server was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I really hate that I can't find my receipt to post his name. He really took care of us. I mean REALLY took care of us. And even better, he understood our sarcastic personalities and even joined in. We had a good time! They give the kids at the table a free appetizer of Bread & Fruit. The bread is incredible. I love a good soft roll! And the fruit were very fresh. I ordered the Calamari appetizer and the Sirlon(Well Done) & Parmesan Shrimp. The Calamari were very tender but they tasted like they were cooked in old oil. My steak was burnt and tough & the shrimp were very oily. The kids got a Pizza. It had soooo much pepperoni on it. I didn't taste it but a lot of people in the restaurant ordered pizzas. They just kept coming out. So I can only assume the Pizzas are a bit hit there. And the kids at our table at 2 slices each. My cousin got the Chicken Alfredo and added shrimp. It was more like Chicken Fettuccini with a few specs of Broccoli. VERY dry! She had to ask for extra sauce on the side. We also tried 2 of the Pizookies for dessert. They were decent but not anything to rave about.

46,Emily R.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,4,1.0,3.0,2016-06-08,"3 stay is ONlY for FOOD! Just a few things I wanted to point out from the reviews I have read after our experience at BJs. 1. Whoever is Loila , I wish we had the pleasure of having your service because our server just DID not care. We went around 3:45 pm , so it was really dead. Food was great , we had the BBQ brisket burger and the Black&Bleu. However it was just the service. Food came out on time , but we were not offered napkins , refills , or even plain and simple , ""May I get you anything else? Thank you enjoy!"" Common courtesy in the restaurant business when your a waitress or waiter. We were not offered dessert, we weren't interested but again it's part of being a server! (I am a current bartender!) Took 15 minutes to get our check way after we were done. Took another 10 to swipe our card.  2. I see they use , ""We dropped the plate of food in the back."" Alot as their excuse to say they basicslly forgot to put the order in. Oldest excuse in the book. The whole , ""My bad I forgot to put it in,"" scenario is not the way to let your table know YOU made a mistake. Get a manager out IMMEDIATELY people ! Apologize for your mistake properly , don't be ghetto about it. 3. Menu. Huge menu. Which is great for a picky eater , but it was very overwhelming. We must have flipped through the menu from cover to cover at least 5 times. Make sure you let your server know you need a few minutes or ask them if they may recommend something to you. 4. Prices are a little on the steep side. Doable however. Food is worth it depending on the plate , but the drinks were a little more than I would've wanted to pay, Especially if the glass is 90% ice.  To wrap this long review up, We will be going back solely based on their FOOD! We are foodies , travel alot to eat , so we are interested in trying more. However , I am hoping for a better server the next time we go or at least see a managers face and ask how our experience was. They are still adjusting , it's only been a few months, but once the summer is over any bad review after that is NO EXCUSE. Get it together BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem?start=40,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
81,Elizabeth M.,"Kernersville, NC",0,9,,2.0,2016-06-12,We made a reservation for 9 people a week in advance. We had no problems with the reservation. They seated us immediately even though very busy. The table was all set up for us. The service was excellent but the wait for the food was a bit long. Some people got excellent food. Some people got OK food. And 2 people got in-edible food. Both the sirloin steak and lemon thyme chicken were so heavily seasoned with salt and pepper you might as well dump the shakers in your mouth. The sirloin was sent back By the time a replacement came everyone else was done so we took a box.

38,Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360.0,5.0,2016-06-28,"To start, we are absolutely hooked on this place. We went three straight time last weekend and the food is dynamite and every waitress knowledgeable and super friendly. That always makes the dining out experience enjoyable. Visit 1: We started out with an appitizer and picked Roasted  Brussel sprouts i drizzled with Honey Sriracha sauce. We are fans of sprouts and this just put it over the top. Perfectly roasted and damn tasty. Decided to order the hickory smoked brisket burger. with bacon and barbecue sauce The brisket was so tender and the hamburger was cook perfectly  (medium). It came with fries which are thin and perfectly salted My fiance ordered the California Chicken Club with fried. She is a fan. Not to mention the Visit #2. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms with lemon pesto aioli sauce. If you're a fan of stuffed mushrooms...order these We had to try the deep dish pizza so we ordered the BJ's special which had homemade meatball, pepperoni, sausage, roasted tomatoes, bell pepper, onions and black olives. It was so good and the crust was nice and crispy.  Visit #3: We decided we only wanted some appetizers this time so we got Portabella mushroom strips. They were very crispy and juicy and came with a garlic aioli sauce for dipping. So delicious. We also order the Queso dip and the homemade guacamole with chips. Also delicious.  Our experience has been nothing but joyous. The food is great and the wait staff is awesome. We are fans of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Be sure to ask for DAPHNE and COURTNEY.

When it came out it was horrible, our deep dish pizza was all crust and burnt on the top and bottom. Yet the toppings weren't cooked all the way through, it was crazy. Service was poor, had to ask multiple times for things. Wait staff would politely smile and say ""sure!"" never to be seen again. It was frustrating to say the least.

We started off with the chicken wings with root beer sauce. They were my favorite part of the whole meal. The wings were meeting and crispy. The sauce was sweet with a little spice and tang. I tried the BJ's special deep dish pizza. I had never had deep dish pizza before and really enjoyed it. I liked the mix of meat and vegetables plus there was a ton on the pizza.

I joined the Premier Rewards club when i went to the Columbus location but never expected to be a big fan. I was wrong. I got a 'BOGOF' lunch coupon email and decided it was time to give the W-S location a try.  As i entered, there was a party of 12 'ladies who lunch' who had neglected to make reservations(really, who does that??!!). I thought 'OMG this is going to be a train wreck'. I was waiting for a friend, so i sat down to see how the staff would handle it. The Manager (Ty?) and his team did a great job getting this party seated and served very quickly. I was impressed. Our server , Ashley, was excellent!!!!!!! I will look for her every time i go back. The menu was extensive enough to satisfy any taste bud, and the  beer selections are varied enough to try new or stay with your standard (check out the sampler!) I ordered the roasted sriracha Brussel sprouts, which were a huge 'no likey'. While the sriracha sauce was excellent, there was not enough of it to offset the bitterness of  the sprouts. I will say that Asley noticed they were greatly untouched and spoke to the manager about it and they took it off the bill. The fried artichoke fingers were unremarkable; no star player there. Any loss of points from the appetizers were more than made up by the rest of the meal. The chicken tortilla and tomato soups were TO DIE FOR! The tomato soup was creamy and robust. A smooth and tasty treat to my palate and a warm hug in my tummy.  The chicken tortilla soup was the star of the show. The server brings it in a two- part presentation. The usual toppings (cheese,tortilla strips, etc) are in a bowl joined with a nice hunk of fresh avocado (nice!). The soup itself is poured from a separate pitcher and the ingredients all join together in holy taste bud matrimony for a true union of soup love. I also had the Cali Chicken Club sandwich. No deli meat here! the bread was perfectly grilled, and the entire sandwich was generous, fresh, and tasty. My BFF had the Caesar salad and it looked like something off the Food Network. Abundant, fresh, and zesty. My only regret is that i left no room for dessert on this visit. The monkey bread with ice cream is THE BOMB (had it in Columbus). I will be returning to continue my gastronomic adventure through this behemoth of a menu.

We always wait a good 10+ minutes before we're even greeted by a server. The last time we went, honestly wouldn't have even gone had it not been for a gift card due to the service the time before that. My husband ordered a burger and fries, and I ordered shrimp tacos and broccoli. An hour and 20 minutes later, with drinks empty, they brought out my husband's food and my tacos. When I asked about the broccoli, she replied ""it's coming. It wasn't quite done cooking yet"". Are you KIDDING ME?! How the hell does it take more than an hour to cook BROCCOLI??? Since when does it take less time to make a burger and shrimp tacos than broccoli??? That should've been one of the first things done! That is exactly why we will NEVER go back to that location ever again. We have the exact same experience every single time. It doesn't matter who waits on us.

I have been looking at the menu online for the last week and despite having a pretty vast selection, nothing really jumped out at me. I ended up going with a wedge salad and the chicken tenders and fries. The hard part about reviewing take out is that I'm sure everything is so much better when eating in the restaurant, not sitting in plastic containers getting cold... The chicken tenders themselves were ok. The fries, despite being cold, were ok as well. I liked that they put them in a paper bag instead of in the plastic container which did help preserve the crispness a bit. My order of fries was minuscule though, boo. My wedge salad was good. All my coworkers noticed how watery the dressings were: ranch for the tenders and the blue cheese for the salad. Someone made the comment on maybe they thin it down so much to stretch it.  One girl actually used her own ranch because she didn't care for the watery one. The consensus from everyone is that the food was ""meh"". Our doctor got the buffalo chicken tender grilled cheese and didn't even finish it and gave me his fries. One girl got the southern fried chicken over mashed potatoes and found plastic (cling wrap) in her chicken.  Everyone got a cookie dessert except me... and they all seemed to enjoy that.

It was not much better.  My wife likes the place so i agreed to go but stated before we walked in if the service is bad I will not come back.  Will never go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
23,Jenna T.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",42,26,77.0,4.0,2017-09-17,"I left BJ's in the best mood. So full, so happy.  This was my first visit and I will be coming back. There are a lot of deals during the week, including discounted pizzookies and loaded burgers, so I would advise going during the week if you want to get the good deals.  I ordered a house burger with avocado and I upgraded to the sweet potato fries; they were an extra two dollars, which I think is silly, so that's my only complaint.  Super good, tasty burger and a good portion. My friend and I also got the pizzookies of course. We were debating between splitting one or each getting one. We made the right decision and we got two. Don't get me wrong, you could split them, but, they are so warm and chewy you probably won't want to share. The service was fantastic, super fast and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
22,Marc P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",63,43,8.0,4.0,2017-09-20,"Came here to support a local charity which is awesome they do that.  I ordered a steak, which came out obviously rare when I ordered it medium. The cook should have been able to tell. They quickly rectified it and brought out a fresh plate. The salad was fresh and crisp. Drink special was on point for $5.00 for a tall vodka drink. And beer was $4 on tap which are great prices.  Definitely a good meal supporting a local charity.  -1 star for messy bathroom that needed attention, misfire on steak and the 92 health rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
20,Darren D.,"Apex, NC",1,42,,5.0,2017-09-25,"1st - It is not related to BJ's warehouse. This will prevent you from asking what a million other customers, including myself have, and the wait/er/ress giving you the same sigh he/she has given a million times while grunting out a barely discernible ""No."" I kid, She was actually very friendly and answered politely. I don't kid about it not being related to BJ's warehouse. It is not. With that out of the way. Wife and I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2ish. Wait staff and food were great. Selection of beers was fantastic. They also have their own brews which were very tasty. Big fan. Place is huge but not hollow or cold. There plenty of TV's but not all in your face. There are just enough in the right spots for you to watch the game without it being obvious to your significant other. See. I got your back. I am not understanding the bad reviews for this place. I know when I go to a new place, I always go easy on the reviews. I throw out the highs and lows. It's new. There will be hiccups especially in service. You have to show a little latitude. I know everyone is not like me. However, be a human instead of some ""I am paying for a service, I deserve the best service"" robot. Be a decent person. Not a tool.  Anyway, we ordered a couple of deep dish pizzas. The veggies on top were crazy fresh. You know when you order a pizza, they usually throw the veggies on top before cooking. I think they throw them on like the last 5 minutes just to warm them. The peppers and onions had a crisp to them like I ate them right off a grocery store shelf. I would know ;) Now listen, the pizza wasn't like Rosati's Deep Dish in Cary. That place is off the charts good deep dish. And I've been to Chicago so I know. I did not stay in A Holiday Inn though so my credibility may be in the pooper. BJ's is still pretty respectable. Not the same page as Rosati's but same chapter maybe.  Their menu is extensive. If they can carry decent quality across the entire menu, I think they will be ok. The only negative I can find is I felt the pricing was a little on the high side. Not Snoop Dog high, just like 9th grader High School parking lot high. We'll be going back regardless of pricing just to try the other menu items. P.S. Not one BJ joke. I am proud of myself. I could have easily mentioned the sausage on the pizza's creamy dressing on my wife's salad but I did not.

However today we decided to take a drive and happened upon this gem. I use Yelp all the time for recommendations but rarely posts reviews but this place deserves it. Awesome staff, huge menu, great beer selections. We just wanted a small snack so we decided on a deep dish pizza. It was amazing and there are so many other things we want to try. We decided right then it would be our place to go every visit. Long story short  give it a try. Good stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
21,Jeffrey H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,14,,2.0,2017-10-16,"My first visit here for lunch over the weekend. Maybe it is a relatively new site and they will work out the kinks, but overall, the experience was less than favorable because although the food (wings and salad) was very good, the beer flight did not meet expectation (tasted as if they have a CO2 to Beer issue with their taps).  Additionally, the staff didn't appear to care if we patronized their business or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-winston-salem,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

How long does it take to cook a steak med-rare? Worst part was the steak had no seasoning not even salt or pepper!! And the second time they burnt the god damn steak and still taste like shit.
