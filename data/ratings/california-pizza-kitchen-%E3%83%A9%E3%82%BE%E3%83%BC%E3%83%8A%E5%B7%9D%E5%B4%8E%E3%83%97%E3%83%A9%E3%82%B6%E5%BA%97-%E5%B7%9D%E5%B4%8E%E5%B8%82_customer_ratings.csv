2,David E.,"Yokohama, Japan",44,47,238,2.0,2016-01-11,"They have a Lunch Set, so it's not as expensive as when they first opened but it's still over my lunch budget. The California prices are very authentic. The pizza is, of course, good. Â Free cola refill is available. Slow check-out to pay your bill. Don't sit in the back booth by kitchen door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BE%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B6%E5%BA%97-%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E5%B8%82,,,,,
1,Jeffrey C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",20,8,5,1.0,2017-04-11,Very slow service. Ordered from the express lunch menu and it took over an hour to get our meal. They kept saying the queue of pizzas to cook was long. Will not come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BE%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B6%E5%BA%97-%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E5%B8%82,,,,,
0,Danielle M.,"Yokosuka, Japan",212,56,25,5.0,2017-04-22,"This place is great! It's pretty much the same thing you'll find in the states plus a couple of local options. The food and drinks are delicious as always and the service is quick. If you're looking for some good old pizza and pasta, check this place out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BE%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B6%E5%BA%97-%E5%B7%9D%E5%B4%8E%E5%B8%82,,,,,
