0,Maeva S.,"Campbell, CA",67,14,1,2.0,2015-10-17,"The service is terrible. Been there twice with my daughter. I always order her a kid's pizza: first time we waited over an hour to get her pizza after several complaints, we even had time to eat our own meal! They gave us a free drink but I had to get up several times and when I finally started talking very loud they took me seriously. For some reason, I went there again and same thing happened with the kid's pizza.  I'll never go there again. Servers barely speak english.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF-2,,,,,
