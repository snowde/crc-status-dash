0,Alice C.,Hong Kong,9,36,102,3.0,2014-07-15,"Sad to say that there are no longer any locations of California Pizza Kitchen on the Island side.  CPK gives me a small taste of home in hectic Mong Kok.  Like most restaurants in this area, CPK is on the upper level.  Situated next to a local chain Japanese restaurant in the Gala Place, CPK is pretty large.  There's usually a short wait if you go in the evening, but you're safe from a wait if your there during the day.  The menu will have your usual suspects that you'd find in any CPK in the states.  The Crispy Thin Crust Sicilian has to be my go to choice.  Loads of yummy meats that include sweet Italian sausage and spicy Capicola ham all on top of a bed of oozy mozzarella cheese.  You'll also find more 'playful' choices of pizza such as Peking Duck Pizza?  Not too sure if I would want that on my pizza, but to each their own. =)  If you're there for a lunch, they offer nice deals that include salads and pastas as well as individual pizzas.  I LOVE their BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, though sometimes, it can be overdressed.  Soft drinks are unlimited refill, so it makes a nice place to have a catch up session with your buds.  The staff there don't speak too much English, but they try hard to tend to whatever you need the best they can.  They usually come around every now and then with their pitchers of tea to give you a top up if need be.  One thing they MUST fix is their Spinach Artichoke Dip...it was disgusting.  My party and I were puzzled when we tasted this and none of us went in for seconds.  I really wish there was something good I can say about this dish, but there isn't.  It tasted like the chef just put frozen spinach together with a glob of bleu cheese and tossed it into the microwave.  The chips, though warm, were stale.  Hope they can improve on this.  Dessert here is just dessert.  Nothing exciting, but still tasted nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF-5,,,,,
