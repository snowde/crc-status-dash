1,Hans C.,Hong Kong,161,215,1879.0,3.0,2016-01-25,"This CPK is located in the Popcorn mall. They have a few outlets throughout Hong Kong.  This is a good place for a family lunch especially kids love it. Service is efficient and friendly.  Quality of food is ok. Don't expect typical Italian fare as this chain comes from the US.  The nacho chips were cold, the guacamole bland, the salsa was good.  The Caesar was freshly done although the sauce was again on the bland side.  Highlight for me was the pizza, a crispy thin crust with nice toppings.  For what you get its not cheap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF-6,,,,,
0,David D.,"Stanford, CA",108,14,,2.0,2017-08-26,"Not awful, but underwhelming.  My wife's pizza lacked cheese, her ice cream had a bizarre texture like it was full of ice crystals. The water tasted like it had sand in it.  My salmon tacos were pretty good, the seafood pizza was just ok.  I would give 3 stars, but it was surprisingly expensive, so 2 stars it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF-6,,,,,
