316,Jonas M.,"Honolulu, HI",307,14,42.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"This is and probably will always be our consistent, go-to dinner spot.  I don't check in here as often as I should, and I should really stock up on those gift card deals that they offer around the holiday time, but that's okay.  I will still come here, regardless of whether or not I'm receiving a special deal or discount. I always go for the sicilian -- I'm a big fan of its thin crust, and I love, love the flavor and spiciness of it.  I usually pair that with the asparagus/brocolli soup (what??!!) -- yeah, it's actually pretty good.   1 time out of 10, I'll probably go and order the jambalaya in place of the pizza.  Again, the heat is awesome. Goes great with a beer. One bad thing for us (but good for them) is that this location is pretty crowded.  As a rule, if we're not there during off-hours, we'll call ahead, and just take it to go.  Big plus for them is that the food holds well as take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=420,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.632,3.84
269,Reuben R.,"Waipahu, HI",33,264,158.0,5.0,2012-01-06,"Wow, why is there always a line for this place whenever we plan to go here? We arrived ahead of our other friends and asked for a table for four, and our wait was set at an hour and there were people all up that handiramp just muttering how hungry they are.  Anyway, after browsing through the mall a bit, we came back hungrier than we had left. We were seated at the far end of the restaurant where it gets narrow. Its a more intimate space in my opinion because the tables are further apart and you have a whole window to yourself. If we could come here and request seats, Id definitely request this one. So we sat down and ordered a few appetizers while still deciding on what we wanted. The waitress came back and we put in our orders and asked for house bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We then ordered a bottle of moscato (that was just okay..) and our entrees came.... Haha, my friend was egging me on to tell the waitress that our apps never came! I just said to cool it cause they're busy. Anyway the manager comes by and helps bring our apps out 10 minutes later, and the server comes back and tells us shes sorry and that the apps are on the house...! O__o wow, very nice of them. Anyway, we weren't flustered at all and had a great time.

300,Don D.,"Oahu, HI",123,366,165.0,4.0,2012-02-21,"The wait was for dinner was an hour. Personally, I think the restaurant should be a little bigger for the amount of business they do.   The quoted wait was 1 hour, and we pretty much waited the whole hour. The best thing about it was they offered to call us on the phone when our table was ready and having the mall right next door made the wait seem a lot shorter. The hostess was great in calling us and seating us at our quoted time.  And she presented our menus individually.   Our server greeted us right away and we placed an order for everything (we had time to look at the menu while we were waiting).  Drinks came out a few minutes later.  Our server brought out bread and by the time we were done with bread, the appetizers started coming out at different times because we said to just bring everything out as soon as it was done.   The bread was nothing special.   Spinach Artichoke Dip ($10.25).  My kids dont eat artichokes OR spinach so when they were eating the dip, it was kind of shocking!  I like how the consistency was more like mush, cause chunks of spinach or artichokes would probably deter the kids from eating it. Lettuce Wraps with Chicken and Shrimp ($13.75). Very tasty sauce, a lot of shrimp and chicken.  The sauce was sweet tasting and it came out still steaming.  I liked this better than the ones they serve at PF Changs! Chicken Tequila Fettucine ($14.60) I LOVED the lime flavor that the pasta came in.  It wasnt too overpowering.  The sauce was not overdone and the pasta wasnt drowning! I would definately order this again. Five Cheese Pizza ($11.65) Cant really review it since I didnt try it but my kids liked it.  Cheese on pizza....what kid doesnt love that? But it did look tasty for just being a pizza. Kids meal: Pepperoni Pizza and Mac and Cheese ($5.50 each) The kids pizza was bigger than a lot of kids pizzas that ive seen at other places and my five year old finished it all.  The mac and cheese looked pretty big for a kids size and my son said it was kinda bland.  It wasnt as cheesy as a mac and cheese should be.  It also came with corkscrew pasta. Service: The service was pretty good.  We were greeted and served right away.  The only thing was, the server that greeted us took our orders and brought out our drinks and appetizers.  But after that, it looked like she was helping the bartender by washing glassware and stuff behind the bar and other servers started helping our table.  Im not sure if thats how it was supposed to be at this location....but it didnt matter to us. When we were done, dishes were bussed, dessert menus were delivered, and payment was processed quickly! We were served and NOT ignored!  Service was great by everyone who helped our table....and that equals a $20% tip. My family and I will definately be back again sometime! I wish I could tell you the name of everyone that helped our table but it there were a bunch.

CPK wins by default! Here's why? They have great small plate options. We had the spinach & artichoke dip with corn chips, the mac & cheese bites & the Shrimp lettuce wraps. All were yummy! Then it was the pizza! Had to have the margherita pizza...it was so nice and fresh...definitely a favorite. They have WINE! Enjoyed a couple of glasses of red wine while we enjoyed our lunch...why not? It was 5PM somewhere, right? And if it's your birthday, you do what you want to do! Since my favorite foodie friend is a ham, and an utter attention whore, I decided to let the server know so that she could embarass him in every possible CPK way. Unfortunate for me, CPK doesnt do ""loud birthday embarassing"" type things. Seems someone complained and they have since stopped this practice. Darn! Anyway, we had a great lunch, enjoyed a couple glasses of great wine and had a nice singing free birthday dessert.

We've been going to CPK for years, and I can't say that I've ever had an exceptional meal there.  This was pretty close.  The service was great, the two kids were extremely happy.  The minus one star is for the cancellation of the crab cakes.  Bring my beloved crab cakes back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=360,3.96,3.96,3.96,3.408,3.96

479,Chad Y.,"Honolulu, HI",1058,1234,446.0,3.0,2012-03-22,"Whenever you go to a California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), you know you are going to have the same experience and food that you would get if you went to a CPK across the world (I've tried it and it's the same). That being said, the Pearlridge location which started it all in Hawaii, is simply ok. It offers the menu you have come to expect, however its service is ok and the location itself is simply ok. Located right on the edge of Pearlridge Downtown, I just have to ask, did they decide to put a greenhouse on the side of the mall and give it to Pearlridge? Cause that's what it comes across, and although tastefully remodeled since its inception, the size is just a tad bizzare and doesn't have enough waiting space to accommodate the masses as they await their table. It's a small strip sidewalk that you have to hug onto the edge for dear life while you watch people walk by.  The menu is what you would get at any of its other locations. How many times can I really talk about their Spinach Artichoke Dip or its BBQ chicken pizza? So instead, I implore you to try some of the items that you might not normally have when you go and repeat the menu over and over again. Perhaps try the mushroom ravioli? With its nicely cooked pasta embedded with a good array of mushrooms and served in a wonderful garlic cream sauce or maybe the chicken piccata? Will it be as authentic in Italy? No? But it definitely is good and full of flavor. Service is ok. The hosts are extremely good at telling you your wait for a table and are right on with their estimates. The wait staff is a little different. It didn't quite live up to the normal expectation that CPK has set for itself and sad to say that water glasses went empty.  Is it great? No, but at the same time it doesn't disappoint and the choices when you cross Red Hill quickly get limited (I'm going to pay for this last comment aren't I?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=300,3.92,3.72,3.72,3.436,3.8000000000000003
370,Cheryl K.,"Honolulu, HI",471,468,452.0,4.0,2012-04-03,CPK in my mind is like gourmet pizza. Well not necessarily like real italian pizza but pretty creative combinations. Pearlridge CPK is a place I used to go to growing up on this part of the island when you felt baller status in high school. I came here with my husband one night when we were lazy to drive into town. For some reason there is always a line here. Because we were only two our wait was about 20 minutes or so on a weekday. Not too bad. It has been a while so I ordered my favorite drink there Appleberry Sangria. I ordered the barbeque chicken and bacon pizza and my hubs ordered the habanero carnitas pizza. Mmm! I got to eat half and half. The salsa that came with the carnitas pizza was super hot. Like so hot that two servers reminded us not to touch your eyes if you touch the salsa. I put tiny amounts of the butt burner on the carnitas pizza and it was pretty good. My bacon and chicken pizza was good too. We pigged out of course. Pizza is like one of our favorite meals. Our server was nice and kept checking on us even though it was really busy. CPK is a go to place when we feel like spending a little more dough on pizza and staying in our neck of the woods.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=400,3.96,3.73,3.73,3.568,3.822

I was afraid that the adobo sauce was going to be a little salty, but that was not the case. It was delicious and had a perfect balance of flavor. It came topped with a corn and black bean salsa and I'm someone that hates corn, but the sweetness of the corn gave the pizza a sweet and savory flavor, which I believe was a necessary flavor to make this pizza amazing. So kudos to them for this amazing flavor combination. This was my first visit to a CPK and I had always assumed it was just a regular pizza place with the normal sauce, meat, cheese kind of place. I never realized just how much variety they offered. The restaurant was pretty clean and our waitress was very attentive to make sure our drinks were full and everything was tasting great. The food also came at a pretty fast pace considering it was a packed restaurant.  I will definitely be coming back to try the many different unique selections they offer...maybe try the peking duck pizza (sounds good), but overall a great experience and the only bad thing is that I never had any room to try their desserts.

This is a very popular restaurant for Mall patrons and always seems seems to have a wait time, especially for dinner.  It would be nicer if they had a larger seating area to accommodate all the customers wanting to dine in.  This is probably one of the smallest branches I have ever been to. I'm a big salad person, so I always get one of their very appetizing, colorful salads.  So far I have tried their Original BBQ Chopped chicken salad, Waldorf Chicken Salad, California Cobb, Roasted Veggie, and Thai Crunch Salads along with a sample slice or two of their pizzas and a pasta dish, but I still remain a big fan of their salads, mainly the Thai Crunch Salad.  It's kind of funny that I come to a pizza kitchen and never have any interest in ordering one of their pizzas. The service here can be hit or miss, so I was having trouble deciding between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.  The food deserves a definite strong 4 stars, but the service is a bit lacking.  Many times I wasn't offered bread, so I had to request it and everything takes so long to come out from your drinks to your food.  And forget about any refills because they never come around for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=260,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.9240000000000004,3.8

It just didn't look professional. I barely go to CPK because of the wait and sometimes the food is just okay, however my mom wanted to go today because she first tried this place when we were visiting California with her friends. So the prices are obviously more here than in the mainland. Anyway, it was my first time at CPK in almost over a year and I definitely did not like the change of the environment. The Food: My mom and I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Thai Crunch Salad. First of all, our order took FOREVER. About 30 minutes and it wasn't just us, it seemed to be everyone around us. I don't remember service being THAT slow. BUT, the Thai Crunch Salad was pretty good. I like the edamame they add in there, and supposedly the mainland CPK's don't add edamame in their salads. The BBQ pizza was of course good, the bread was cooked nicely. A nice thing they did to kinda show their apology of waiting was they gave us bread and olive oil... but that stuff is always free.

Back on the inside, while the food is always top quality, a few years back, they changed their bread policy.  They don't freely offer it anymore, you must ask for it.  Some shoppers don't realize that they can still get bread if they simply ask, and that sometimes makes you feel like Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.  Embarrassing.

I think I even went as far as calling you my favorite restaurant. But those days are so so so far gone.  I've been to CPK twice in the past two weeks. Because, in my head, CPK is where I've had some of my best meals. But every single time I go, it gets worse. And now, it's becoming more of a ""if I have to"" place to eat rather than a ""I want to."" Let's talk about what happened the last - last time I was there (about a week ago), I order the artichoke dip (a staple to any CPK experience). It comes out, it's good. Artichoke dip tastes good. But chips...so so stale. :( Sad times. Then, I decide that I want my roasted vegetable foccacia sandwich that I know and love, but realized that they no longer say that it's made with foccacia on the menu. So, I ask the server for clarification and she says ""yes, it's foccacia I am SURE. You can have the garlic cheese or the herb onion."" So of course, I get the garlic cheese (no brainer right?) When it comes out. 1st of all, it's french bread with parsley sprinkled on it. There's no way in hell this is foccacia. 2nd...where's the mound of roasted bell peppers and yumminess that used to be this sandwich? It's thin and lame. I bite the sandwich, and with every bite I am sure it is not foccacia (My friends, being nice people, said ""well...maybe they bake it differently now""). Anyways, I eat it, and I tell the waitress when she FINALLY comes to check on us ""I'm just letting you know, for your benefit, that this is NOT foccacia."" and she said ""Oh. but it IS."" and I said ""no, I know what this used to taste like and it's not, and it's ok, but I just wanted you to be aware because I don't want you telling another customer who specifically asks what bread it's on be lied to.""  She asked if I wanted to speak to a manager, I said no. She then went away for awhile, came back, and then said....""oh, you know what it is, I always eat it with the garlic cheese bread. You should've ordered that type of foccacia it's the best."" WHAT?! --- I was soooo irked because...I DID!  Anyways, she ended up telling her manager anyway who then apologized and said that our waitress was new and offered a free dessert. I declined the dessert because I didn't want anything out of this. I just wanted them to know that they are misrepresenting their product. It was more of an FYI for your own benefit thing.  I mean, even if she was a new waitress who ""just came out of training"", this lady swore up and down that it was foccacia and also swore that she ate it on cheese foccacia recently. So...idk. Get it together CPK. If your own employees who just got done training don't know what you're serving, how are the customers supposed to know what to expect from you? Fast forward to last night. My girlfriend decides to go to CPK and I agree, I mean, maybe it was just a weird bread problem the other night. We go, I order the white corn guac small plate. Had no taste. And from the last time I've had it, it seems to have gotten flooded with avocado with very little corn or beans at all. Sad times. I then go and order pasta. A staple. A go to. They can't screw this up right? WRONG. My ravioli was soooooo bland and tasteless. What happened to the cream sauce? Why does it taste like water? I don't understand! A friend of mine says that they make their pasta sauces in big batches now, and if the wrong person is serving and doesn't mix the sauce and just scoops it from the top, it's very possible that you get a bland, lame tasting pasta. I don't know if that's true, but it's really how it tasted. I was kinda wishing I had eaten somewhere else....anywhere else. Idk. CPK, you keep changing your menu. Your items, the way things are prepared. And it's just SADDDD. Because you used to be good and now I don't know what to expect from you. It's always been a mall restaurant. But now it's beginning to taste like a crappy bulk manufactured mall restaurant.  Sad times. I can't say I won't return because I probably will. It's in the mall and at least they have alcohol. But gosh darn it, I probably wont' enjoy it. Sad times CPK. Sad times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=240,3.24,3.61,3.61,3.236,3.462

406,Joy P.,"Waipahu, HI",245,37,105.0,4.0,2014-03-18,"Why I choose to endure a 30-40 minute wait at this place is beyond me.  The first time I ate here, I was amazed by the menu. All kinds of pizza and salads, and pasta too! It's not an Italian restaurant, it's CPK! Being an island girl all my life, I've always enjoyed American food and going to CPK made me think, ""damn, so this is what they eat on the mainland!?"" You must be thinking, what a dumb, naive, wannabe-from-the-mainland chick, right?  Anyway, I'm older and wiser now and know that there are better options the island has to offer, but CPK is a must for a couple staples on their menu.  First off: the artichoke dip. Best appetizer for a group of 4 or more, but even better when it's just you and a friend.. Less need to share :)  Their pizzas. You'd think you'd get a medium sized pizza from Pizza Hut with the price you're paying for, but the pizzas they serve here aren't typical. Less oily and more refreshing. Tickle your taste buds with the variety of pizzas they have in their menu. My faves: The California Club (because bacon and avocado are the loves of my life) and the Original BBQ Chicken.  And finally their salads. This place offers more than your classic garden and Caesar salads, they have a Thai crunch salad, Waldorf Chicken salad, and my fave the original BBQ chicken chopped salad. Now, i don't know the nutritional value of these salads, but a part of me thinks that these salads are not for the strict dieters. If my taste buds are rockin out in ecstasy, it's probably not as healthy as the name suggests.  I was thinking of giving it 3 stars, I'm cheap, and I don't think the menu prices are justified. A salad for more than $10? I might as well go to Aloha Salads and buy something I know is good for you. However, I can't think of a place that offers the same variety of menu options so for that reason, 4 stars it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=240,3.52,3.62,3.62,3.44,3.5800000000000005

The pizza was awesome and the addition of the peppers complimented it nicely.   My wife got the Roasted peach gorgonzola salad.  No complaints from her at all.  The waitress kept out soda full, saw that we had 3 children, one of which was getting a little cranky, and rushed all our food to us.  Even brought out our desserts quickly with our check.

Went on a Wednesday night with thee wife, and there were a couple of crowds in front of us, when we got to check in, the hostess informed my wife that it would be a 30-45 min wait (and yes I could read her lips tell my wife this info, but knowing my wife if she wants to eat somewhere that I have not ate at yet and she absolutely loves it, she will not tell me about no wait time, due to the mere fact I am super impatient, especially when I am hungry lol) so as she came out of the door, she smiled and told me it would be 25-30min tops (HA YEAH RIGHT!) lucky I was still content with my lunch date I had with her at Buffalo Wild Wings, so I did not complain about her doing a little ""white lie"" on the estimated time given (lol) they give you a little ""buzzer"" to inform you when a seat is available so we ended up walking around inside of Pearl Ridge to kill time, we probably spent 20 min in there and decided to go check on the seating and we luckily got there on time! The hostess was friendly saying that we were the next people to be seated, and then within 2 min, our buzzer went off while she waved us down (so it was perfect timing!).  Seating area, was okay, a bit small for my taste, plus it was smudge right by the glass case by the door area, so it was not my favorite spot, but no complaints just was excited to see what was on the menu! So as I checked in on Yelp, I seen that if we download they're app, you receive a free ""small plate"" as well collect ""dough points"" when eating at CPK (which is awesome! anything free at any eatery place always makes me happy lol) so I checked in and you are suppose to give your waitress/waiter a code that is given so that can place your points and whatnot, I told her that this was my first time experiencing CPK and she said automatically informed me  that if it was my first time, I get a free ""small plate"" regardless, so might as well save the one on my app (YAY! I was more excited! knowing that I could come back and eat again haha) but besides all the great freebies, lets get to the main part the FOOD!  Drink: Strawberry Ice tea - not sweet at all, with a hint of strawberry, this tea is my absolute favorite! & its free refills! awesome awesome beverage!!! Appetizers:  Tuscan Hummus ($7.69)  -   have a Hummus obsession, so ofcourse I had to order it! Nothing really special about the hummus except they have a couple of tomatoes diced up in there, and I love love they're pita bread! soft, and fresh! definitely the best pita tasted on an appetizer!  Lettuce Wraps (Chicken $10.49) -  my wife swears by this appetizer! she absolutely loves this & recommends it to anyone! they have 3 options of either chicken, shrimp or both! its delicious with Fresh Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions tossed in they're spicy ginger soy sauce (yummy!)  Free Small Plate  - Shaved Mushroom and Spinach ($6.69)  was toasty and delicious! it had Cremini mushrooms, sautéed spinach, and California Olive Ranch extra virgin olive oil with Romano and Parmesan! a definite must try! ^-^ Main Dishes: Jambalaya Fettuccine ($18.19) worth the price to me!  - A CPK favorite as well as my new favorite Pasta! It has a little spice kick (to my taste) it was as if I jumped in a Jambalaya bowl of heaven!!!! DELICIOUS! Everyone who comes here should at least try this!!!! Its Blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, Andouille sausage and Tasso ham in spicy Cajun sauce! (had some leftovers for this morning and devoured it in happiness, and was sad that it was gone within 2 min! ): wahh!)  Garlic Cream Fettuccine ($12.19)  (with chicken $2.59) - my wife's plate  She absolutely loved it, she wanted to note that it was creamy and had great equal parts of sauce, chicken and pasta! its basically the ultimate roasted garlic Parmesan cream sauce, and you can add chicken, shrimp or both and sauteed mushrooms (all with additional costs) I tasted it and it was pretty good, Im not a fan of heavy creamy sauces and I have heavy ""spaghetti marinara sauce"" but my wife's plate was not so bad (in my words b/c she said it was BOMB DIGGADY lol)  Desert:  OKAY, so the whole reason for eating here, was due to the fact that my wife wont shut up about the awesome, delicious, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, heavenly BUTTER CAKE!

480,Rhea-Liza V.,"Honolulu, HI",627,21,25.0,2.0,2014-07-02,"Food was terrific as always! My fiance and I had our first date at a CPK 5 years ago and we make it a tradition to go often and to every state/city we go to.  We've been to the Aiea restaurant before, but this past time was terrible! First off, my strawberry rhubarb drink was so horrendous! It was such an intense caramel taste that just lingered there. I admit that it was a risk to try something new, but the fact that my server had no idea what rhubarb was and also what the drink tasted like didn't help out either. I asked for my usual instead (raspberry lemon drop), which I usually LOVE LOVE LOVE! However, the bartender must have been either pissed, new, or not paying attention because my drink came with a rim of SALT instead of sugar. Just in case you never had one before, salt completely ruins the taste. I tried being a good sport and wiping it off, but some got in the drink. I was very unhappy with this.  Finally, our appetizer (avocado egg rolls--NOM NOM NOM) came literally 2 minutes before our main meals. For a two top table, this was very difficult considering the lack of space and the limited ability to enjoy the appetizers BEFORE the meal.  Our server was nice though...but I don't even remember his name so he probably wasn't that awesome.  Considering that CPK is my fiance and I's fave restaurant, this past experience was so disappointing. I'll second guess myself next time we think about going to this particular one.

258,Hoku T.,"Honolulu, HI",321,120,395.0,5.0,2014-07-14,"This location is over 20 years old and you can tell the menu has changed over the centuries... If you're a frequent customer - best time to go is during their CPK Yellow card giveaways! You can score % off your bill, free desserts or money! Only for a brief time in June and July.  I remember my first pizza, it was like eating Beef Broccoli on a pizza.  Although the complementary bread has changed through the years, it's always been fresh and warm when brought to the table.  I like that they have new salads, pizzas, and desserts that work with the season.   The food is always great, but what sets this location from the other locations is the service. If you have a great waiter or waitress, then you'll have a great experience and want to return again.  Things to try at your next visit-  Thai Crunch Salad - this has a nice oriental dressing (not to runny), crunchy rice chips and wonton chips, soybeans, peanuts, bok choi, and lettuce. A lot of ingredients that blend well together and won't make you full.  Bianco Flatbread - this is a must if you want to skip on the complementary bread. Add the White Truffle oil ($1.50 more) and you'll thank me later! If you love eating good melted cheese and bread...this ones for you! I'm even thinking about taking this to go next time and drizzle honey butter.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken - at first I thought this was gonna be a lame chicken pizza... Well, it was sort of... All you have to do if you're a 'Hot Mouth' like me and love spicy food -  ask for the Habanero Salsa. Yes, you may be thinking, you're crazy! Haha, well, the salsa at the first bite gives a cool fruity taste you wouldn't expect that hits your tongue with pineapple and mango with a light tomato... Then with your second bite, that's when the salsa reveals itself as a villain and scorches your tongue...and when the slice is all over, you want to do it again, because you miss that sizzling sensation on your tongue!  Butter Cake and Salted Caramel Pudding - these two desserts will always find extra space and cracks in my stomach! I can only describe these two desserts as if you want to share - you'll only get 4 nice spoonfuls of each goodness. If you want to indulge - have your own! Not to sweet on the taste buds and totally worth saving some room for!  Enjoy your next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=120,3.92,3.71,3.724,3.604,3.794

The waitress said it'd be coming right up but time kept on ticking and then a manager came up & said 'don't worry we didn't forget you'. Another wait, and finally the pizza was brought by the manager. As pleasant as everyone was, we were annoyed. Half the table was done eating when his food came & it truly seemed shocking that no one addressed it.

139,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,3.0,2014-10-03,"CPK was always considered a safe destination when it came to larger family dinners. During high school, I remember going to CPK for my cousins' birthdays or to celebrate special occasions, so I've discovered a few tried-and-true favorites throughout the years.   Recently, though, it seems like CPK has taken a turn to become more gourmet. It's still family friendly, but I feel like the ambiance isn't the same as it was when I was in high school. Some of the casual comfort may be gone in subtle ways--the eatery now also features a small bites/tapas menu, and the slices of complimentary bread remind me of the type served at Romano's Macaroni Grill (rustic, artisanal bread served with olive oil for dipping)--but delicious cuisine still remains.   Here are some of my must-haves when it comes to dining at CPK. I'm glad that, regardless of the various menu changes over the years, you can still find some of my favorite dishes:   ""Spinach and Artichoke Dip"": I've tried the ""Spinach and Artichoke Dip"" at many different places, but I still think that CPK's version of this shareable appetizer is one of the best. The dish is served with a generous amount of colorful chips and the mix is extremely cheesy (just the way I like it). There's always a mad dash to scoop as many chips-and-dip as possible whenever this appetizer comes to our table. ""Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese"": This shareable ""small plates"" dish consists of four, bite-sized mac 'n cheese balls that's lightly fried with panko and served on creamy cheese sauce. This is one of the newer additions to the CPK menu, and though it's not as cheesy as my favorite ""Deep Fried Mac 'n Cheese Balls"" from The Cheesecake Factory, it's still an enjoyable bite-sized snack you can nibble on while waiting for your entrée. It's worth trying if you haven't ordered it before.    ""Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup"": While I don't like peas, I am a diehard fan of CPK's ""Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup."" This soup is a winner in my eyes because of the barley it includes. This hearty split pea soup--filled with barley, carrots, onions and savory herbs; topped with scallions--is great for an appetizer. ""Two in a Bowl"": Though I don't like my foods to mix, this ""Two in a Bowl"" soup dish surprisingly keeps the two featured soups--""Sedona Tortilla Soup"" and ""Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup""--pretty well separated, as if an invisible line were drawn down the middle of the bowl! I enjoy both soups and it's nice to get the contrast in the same bowl--the mellower ""healthier"" split pea soup and the mild kick of the ""Sedona Tortilla,"" which features vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos, corn, mild green chilies, Southwestern spices and tortilla strip garnishes. This is a good pick for lunch or if you're wanting a lighter dinner.    ""White Pizza"": Throughout the years, I've tried several different types of pizzas from CPK, and the ""White Pizza"" still remains as my favorite one. I always opt for this choice with applewood smoked bacon. Because I'm not particularly fond of tomato sauce, this pizza is perfect. It includes spinach, cheese and garlic (bacon is a slight additional fee). I love the mix of cheese flavors on this pizza, and I usually finish about half the pizza (3-4 slices) and try to take the leftovers home.   ""Grilled Chicken Caesar"": This sandwich features shaved Parmesan, lettuce and tomatoes (I order mine without tomatoes) on your choice of bread (I go with grilled focaccia). But the best part about these sandwich choices is that they come with your choice of a cup of soup or Caesar salad -- and of course, I opt for the ""Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup.""   ""Red Velvet Cake"": I feel that ""Red Velvet Cake"" can be a hit or miss dessert at some restaurants, but at CPK, it's a hit. This dessert--though I believe the size has shrunk over the years--features several layers of moist red velvet cake and vanilla bean frosting, topped with elegant white chocolate curls. This dessert is delicious because of the moist cake, and though I still prefer cream cheese frosting on my red velvet, this combo is worth trying if you've never had CPK's version of ""Red Velvet"" before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=180,4.16,3.83,3.756,3.34,3.962

I am vegetarian and have been for 25 years, but when I went there I was given a flatbread that had obviously been cut with the same cutter as a peperoni pizza ... no biggie that is not my complaint - I told the waitress it tasted of meat - she apologized and offered to replace it. Then the GENERAL MANAGER came to the table and told me that was NOT possible - company policy does not allow cutting of non meat dishes with the same blades and it was NOT possible that I tasted meat. (But I did taste meat !!!) She continued to scold me like a school child at my table - I asked her TWICE to go away - that we were done talking, and she kept on and on at me with her voice getting louder and louder on how I was wrong - but then and this is my complaint - she walked over to the waitress station pointing at me and laughing !

472,Erica N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",148,14,15.0,4.0,2014-10-24,"Within these past few months I've found myself coming to this location more frequently than normal. On the several visits, I was never disappointed.  If you're a newbie to CPK, here's some recommendations.  Appetizer wise, I've only tried the lettuce wraps. In all honesty, it's a bit pricey for the amount given (~$11-12).  Try it with both the chicken & shrimp! It's really tasty and flavorful.  It's also a mix that goes well together. (Kudos to my friend for introducing it to me) ;)  If you're legal & looking for drinks, I've tried both of their sangria's. The mango one is my favorite of the two, although the red sangria is good if you're more of a wine type of gal. If you opt for something fruity, definitely try the mango!  I really love the California Cobb pizza. Another friend of mine ordered it one day and since I've ordered it twice on different occasions. Portion wise it's big.. I recommend you sharing it with someone else.  It's a pizza with an underlying layer of bacon, chicken, meats & topped on the top is lettuce and avocados.  I love it because it's such a good balance of meats/veggies.  A couple of friends I introduced it to didn't like it much because they're not into veggies. Another favorite dish of mine is Jambalaya Fettuccine which is a savory (to me it's not that spicy) pasta with cajun sauce, chicken, sausage, shrimp, crawfish & ham bits which altogether is a must try!  If you still have room for dessert (yes, please save your appetite! you should take home leftovers and try dessert) a really good one is the butter cake with vanilla ice cream! It's heavenly. It's a very thick, not too sweet butter cake with ice cream and whipped cream. When you eat it, the warmth of the cake and the ice cream compliment each other so well you, you definitely won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=300,3.84,3.83,3.756,3.408,3.834

207,Gina K.,"Pearl City, HI",74,55,28.0,1.0,2014-10-27,"Used to love this place back when the bread was good but have noticed its steady decline in quality and service. After my most reent visit I will not be returning.  Which I really hate because it is one of the only places in Aiea that you can order online!  I really don""t know why more places don""t get with it and make this an option at their storefronts? No more ringing phones bothering production, no more botched order from the noisy clatter that makes it impossible to hear or order...geez any cell phone with text messaging would do! Anyways back to the review. So I placed our order online and cringed at the $70+ price for dinner for the three of us; 3 pasta dishes, a half salad ad the cheese and mushroom bread - cuz that sourdough boloney they serve now just sucks *ss! No drinks & no desserts. Another thing I'll miss is the speediness in which the order is ready -30min! So we arrive there a few minutes after the designated time. I run in while my son parks in the loading area and I head straight for the pick up phone order part of the bar, smiling awaiting my order. So as I stand there, I try to make eye contact with one of the two ""chefs""(?)that are standing there laughing, chit chatting and scraping crud fro the corners of their workstation, to no avail. Then I try to make eye contact with a third employee, the bartender I presume, who is also chatting away with fellow employees, all which pay me no mind. So after about 4 minutes of being professionally ignored, I give a big, ""HELLLOOOOO?!?!?"" which actually almost stuns them momentarily- like I was so rudely disturbing their shenanogans and they go back to their chatting. WTF? I think to myself and blurt out, ""Cu*ts!"" Luckily that goes unheard as well.Astonished, I just stand there a few more minutes tapping my cards on the counter. Finally, I throw my hands up and yell ""excuse me??"" then point at myself with both hands aand they all almost snap out of it long enough to point to some guy frantically scurrying in from the back whom, of course just scurries past me without any regaur whatsoever. He tidies up his awaiting outgoing orders, friffss their crappy bags of bread up and the ""chef"" closes to us gives him a little elbow and nudges him towards me. ""Oh"" he says, and I say ""yeah order for ..... and he kindly obliges and bags my order and throws in 5-6 sets of cuttlery and two bags of their gross bread. He has me sign my bf's name on the charge receipt nextto the big fat zero I add as the tip. The food sucked, I don't know if I will waste my time bothering the management unless they are going to refund my money since I will never eat there again and most times they just comp you a drink or something that you have no real way of getting anyways.

I made sure that we came early because I knew the line would be long. I checked Yelp and it said that they opened at 11am. We got there at 10:40am and the restaurant was almost full with 2 open tables left. They opened at 10:30am. We get seated and put in our order. For the appetizer, we ordered the guacamole with corn dip that came with a side of chips. It was actually better than I thought but I still prefer the traditional way better. My husband ordered from the Vet's menu and I ordered from the regular menu. He got the thai crunch salad with extra dressing and the thing is huge. The salad comes with dressing on the side and you mix it in yourself. It was so good, one of the best salads ever. I ordered the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza so that my husband and I could share since he doesn't eat red meat. When the pizza came out, it was the hawaiian pizza with the ham. I called the server over and explained the situation to him. He apologized and put in a new order for the correct pizza which took another 20 minutes. He said that he could pack up the wrong pizza for me and that I could take it home for no charge, which was nice of him. The pizzas to me were just ok. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad. It's preference. I like my pizza crispy but they don't make their pizzas crispy. The crust is just a little hard and chewy. Service gets 5 stars.

But we went ahead and order the full size salad which was around $15-17, totally worth it! Omg so goooood... then we shared a Kung pao spaghetti, it was one of there popular items - but wasn't that excited over it. Ended dinner with there oh so yummy Butter Cake with ice cream , still one of my faves. So overall, was a good dinner, without the gift card total dinner cost about $48-50 for both of us...  TRY THEIR SALAD, if you're a salad person - you'll love it!!

589,Daren N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,6,,1.0,2015-03-07,"Normally, I don't have any issues with CPK.  I love their jambalaya fetuccini dish.  We ordered a Jamaican jerk chicken pizza and I swear to you, there was only 6 (I counted) small pieces of chicken on the pizza.  Soo few that two slices did not even have a piece of chicken on it.  I brought this to the attention of the waitress to see for herself.  She tried to explain that there is a ration of chicken for each pizza in which I replied ""this is not my first time here nor the first time I ordered this pizza.""   I told her if the rations had decreased, then i am willing to pay more for more chicken.  Afterall, its not her fault if the rations decreased.  She went and got the manager and he told them to just make another one with more chicken and tried to explain to us that they were running low on chicken. ???   He told us that we can take the 1st pizza home for free and they will make another one. Since we were sitting at the bar, we had a  front row seat of the chef at work. I guess since we asked for more chicken that didn't go over well with the pizza maker because he drenched the chicken in cayenne pepper so much it was dark brown. We watched his female co-worker come from the side soaking the chicken and throw the chicken on the pizza he was preparing.  When it was served to us, my girlfriend took one bite and was almost in tears.  My first instinct was to throw the pizza  across the bar at him but I let her do the talking to the manager again.  His excuse, she was new and went overboard with the pepper.  I wanted to make him eat a slice so he can feel what his subordinates just put my girlfriend through.   I was very angry and disappointed.  When i reach that state of mind, I learned to leave to avoid incident. I gathered our belongings and paid the check with tip for the waitress (it was not her fault) and took our 6 piece chicken pizza home.   This happened Tuesday night, 3 Mar 15 around 8pm.  The general mgr can do the math and pinpoint exactly who the culprits are.  Nicole was our server at table 8/1 receipt number 110043.   Hopefully this will be a single incident.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=320,3.56,3.8,3.736,2.8200000000000003,3.7039999999999997

We heard there was a discount if we went to California Pizza Kitchen at Pearlridge, so we went to check it out. We assumed it would be a very modest discount, maybe a personal pizza or something. After sitting down, we received some of the most amazing service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. Bright, friendly faces, sparkling personalities, and an absolute can do attitude. We ordered a ton of food, expecting to cover most of the expenses, however we were shocked when we saw how large the discount was. We almost felt criminal and tried to offset the savings with a large tip.

Wine and Beer are also reasonably priced (more so than the cocktails) for those that want a nice tasty beverage with their meal. Food:  Salads always fresh, pasta done right, and innovative pizzas. I normally order the thin crust of whatever pizza we're ordering as I'm a fan of a crispy crust. The sandwiches are also tasty and the fish tacos are pretty good. The big plus for us is all CPK establishments maintain a consistent quality and you can trust your meal will meet your expectations if you've ordered it before. Service: Servers are normally great. Friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. I've had only at very few isolated issues with service over the past few years but that would definitely be the exception and management is quick to remedy any situation. They always accommodate special requests with a smile and make  good recommendations.  Atmosphere: Normally bustling and wait times can extend to one hour plus during peaking dinner hours. Even when the house is packed, the restaurant doesn't feel overly crowded or noisy. If the wait is long and there are just two of you, try and get a seat at the bar.  The bar is actually one of my favorite seats in the house as you get to watch them make the pizzas and the bartenders are great! Value: Good value for what you receive which is a consistently good dining experience with fresh ingredients. The draft and bottled beers are very reasonably priced and I love that they have an option for a 9 ounce wine pour. Sometimes you want a little more than a glass of wine but not two glasses, the 9  oz pour is a great idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=100,3.44,3.71,3.724,3.088,3.6020000000000003

We got to our table and a total of three  servers came to us before our real server! One took our drink and appetizer order, a second one merely asked if we had been served yet, and the third server delivered our drinks until we then met our actual server who was a bit socially awkward....  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip that we've always ordered- and it wasn't the same creamy fine chopped spinach as before.  The children's pepperoni pizza was way too greasy and spicy!

I ordered my daughter's food first and it came out at a reasonable time. My husband and I ordered pizzas and our wait time was more than 30 minutes. The nice waitress explained that my husband's pizza burned and that they made another pizza for him. I appreciated that they explain why the wait was long and I'm glad they didn't serve a burnt pizza to my husband. HOWEVER, when our pizzas did come out, it was my California Club Pizza that was a disappointment. I took a bite of my pizza and tasted a plain burnt pizza. I remember this pizza as a fresh tasting pizza and it was far from that. I continued to eat the pizza so I could figure out what was wrong with it. Then I thought, there wasn't enough dressing on the salad maybe that's way it wasn't tasty. I looked underneath the salad to see burnt bacon on the pizza. :( The edges of the pizza was slightly burnt as well. I compared the picture I took of my pizza and the other California Club pizza pictures on Yelp and my pizza was burnt, the salad not crispy and fresh looking and you couldn't see on my picture if there was dressing on the salad. You can clearly see dressing on the other pictures. It did NOT look like how it was suppose to be. I understand the wait for my husband's pizza but if the other pizza was not up to par they should not have served the pizza or they should have made another pizza at the same time my husband's pizza was made a second time.  I appreciated that someone came by to apologize and they took out the pizza from the bill. But nonetheless I am still a disappointed customer. I loved ordering the California Club Pizza.

I wish I had room for dessert, but I rarely do. A few times the Server let us order the kid's brownie sundae. It's really good! Malinda took great care of us! Super sweet, super nice.

My experience was here was above average but not to the point where I could give 5 stars. Only one thing that I was upset is the drink that I ordered. Never mess with my first drink cause it had a lot of ice in it. I drank it in a minute or two. Wasn't satisfying. So I ordered beer instead. Anyways what caught be by surprise is that my other halfs pizza crust was burnt but they did say we'll make a new one for u to take home. I was like blown away where of course they would go out of there way to make a new one. Now that's customer service. I'm pleased with the service and especially with the server that we had.

Since we were overlooking the bar, the pizza 'n pasta making stations, and plating of all the appetizers and main dishes, it kind of made our decision making process much more difficult because everything looked so delicious! Service was great! Our server took notice when we were ready to place our order. Delivery was pretty quick, too! We ended up with Chicken Lettuce Wraps for starters, Thin Crust Pepperoni Pizza, and Chicken Tequila Fettuccini for the main dish. Oh! And there was complimentary french bread and olive oil for dipping.  Everything was delicious! But, I should caution you that the Thin Crust can get a little too crunchy, so if you have any issues with your jaw, you may want to stick with their Original Hand Tossed. The pepperoni was excellent though. Highly recommend it as a topping on any pizza! If you're a lover of Moscow Mule, order it here! It was a perfect pair to my meal.

So I get up and walk over to Daniel, who has the look of an idiot now, and ask if those two parties had reservations. He stammered to answer because he'd come to the realization that he forgot about my party. He offers to seat me. FUCK THAT! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE BEGINNING SETS THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE VISIT!!!!!! Why the fuck would I want to still eat there?! So I say no in the nicest tone I could possibly muster and walk out. Then I decide to turn around and get the name of the woman who looked as if she was the manager, but stood there with the same idiot look Daniel had and did nothing to assist the situation. Her name was Trisha or Tricia (however the fuck you wanna spell it). If I wasn't as tired as I was, I probably would have caused a scene so that the entire restaurant knew of their stupudity.

First thing my boyfriend brought up was how dirty the menus were.  Being part of the restaurant industry for a while, I understand that there are details that can sometimes be hard to catch, but there were dried CHUNKS of food on his menu.  Like there's no way menus stacked on top of it could've sat flat, at all!   I had to use my napkin for my stuffy nose and he didn't want my utensils resting anywhere on the menus (which took up the whole table) so he held it until we received the bread plates.  Also, and I don't know if it was his time of the month (hehe) but he was also disappointed that his menu didn't have the center insert with the seasonal specials like mine did.  Anyway, long story short, I really only enjoy the appetizers, nowadays.  I've had the pizzas that were either really tough or the sauce too sweet.  I've had the sandwiches which had ciabatta bread that cut the roof of my mouth.  And the pasta's weren't exactly out of this world.  But, because the appetizers are so delicious, I just get them as my meal.  The avocado club egg rolls, the spinach artichoke dip, lettuce wraps, and the hummus. All excellent and I've never had a complaint about them ever.  Oh, and the new Moscow Mules they serve are magical! Service was excellent, food came out timely and hot (taste is another issue, unless it's an appetizer), and place looked as clean as can be. Just please, pretty please, bring back the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli!  And NO I will not order the cheese ravioli, add mushrooms, and request for the garlic cream sauce.  It's not the same, but I appreciate the effort to accommodate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=100,3.8,3.53,3.648,3.404,3.638

Every time we eat at CPK I always get the garlic cream fettuccine w/ shrimp and mushrooms.... Awesome! Just fantastic! Along with the butter cake! The best dessert ever!

466,Marilyn C.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,1.0,5.0,2016-04-24,Just had my son's 7th birthday party here.   It was great and the kids had a lot of fun.  Our hosts Kat and Jerry took really good care of us.  They helped the kids make their pizzas then took them on a tour of the kitchen.  They even took any adults that wanted to see too!   For our party we preordered food for the adults.  There were extra tables for them to hang around while the kids made their pizzas together.  Kat and Jerry were really organized and kept everything moving along at a nice pace.  At the end they helped pack all the food. The kids all got coupons for a free kids meal which was nice too.  I would definitely recommend a pizza party at cpk Pearlridge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=300,4.04,3.72,3.724,3.2520000000000002,3.8480000000000003

Good thing it was one of my few patient days.  Finally I'm putting in my order to go. Sit down wait about 10-15 mins. Then get my food and I'm off back to the office to eat. The usual packaging with bread (cold and hard) and the oil herb dip and the fettuccine. It was warm, cools down from the 10 minute drive no fault of theirs. The flavor is pretty standard but what made me drop the two stars was the under cooked fettuccine, it was hard in some areas of the pasta which made me feel like I was eating playdo.

The girl who answered the phone said she couldn't quote us because we had to walk in. We told her we wanted to do call ahead, but wanted to know what their current wait time was. We were pulling up to the mall to park. She again said she couldn't quote us a time or do call ahead. Then she suddenly transfers us to the host stand. That girl again tells us that she can't quote us, but she'll take our call ahead ??? What? We don't want to do a call ahead if it's still going to be a 45 min wait. After silence on her end while she thought about it, she finally says there's no wait at the moment. THANKS! That's all we wanted to know. We walk in 5 mins later and are sat right away.

First visit I got the creamy garlic fettuccine, it tasted so rich and flavorful!  My mister and I usually split our meals, but since he wanted only a salad, I didn't offer him any.  He automatically thought I was going to share, but I didn't offer it was so good.  My mister got the caesar salad, it was a vinegar or oil based dressing, not the creamy type that we are use to, so we didn't like it, and won't order it again.  My son got the BBQ chicken pizza, he liked it and said he would order it again, the pizza was large enough for 2. Second visit I got the pesto cream penne, it was good, not as rich as the creamy garlic fettuccine. I didn't taste much of the pesto though, felt like it needed more flavor, I guess I should have asked for parm cheese, but it was okay.  I took home the leftovers and my mister and devoured it.  I also got the arugula salad which was delicious, what I think really makes it is the shaved parm cheese, and sundried tomatoes.  The arugula is not overly dressed, so you can taste everything els. The girls and I all insisted we were full, but still ordered dessert which all 5 of us split, was the butter cake with ice cream, and the chocolate souffle cake with ice cream.  We ate it like a bunch of starved savages, so much for us claiming to be ""full"".   Both desserts was so delicious, but I preferred the butter cake.  As for the chocolate souffle, I felt the chocolate syrup or hard bits of chocolate on the cake was quite bitter, the ice cream definitely helps to off set.   Our waiter was so patient with me and my girlfriends! however, when we go out, we usually like to sit and talk and take our time.  Well, CPK is not the place for that, they we so crowded, and of course they would be on a Saturday, at lunch time.  We need to find somewhere that we won't feel rushed, and a place we can actually hear each other.

CPK is one of those restaurants for me.  I normally get the Vegetarian Pizza on honey wheat dough or the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Shrimp (add mushrooms).  A few years ago, it was mentioned to me that CPK has this ""Adventure Guarantee"" that allows you to try something new on the menu that you've never had.  And if you don't like it, they'll give you what you normally get.   Well, I went on that ""adventure"" once and tried the Brussel Sprouts Pizza and really did not like it.  So they took it away and made me my normal Veggie Pizza.  Call it ""scarred"" but it's been years since I took that adventure again.  Until 2 nights ago, a bunch of our friends got together.  This night I didn't feel like eating the Veggie Pizza or the Garlic Fettuccine.   I looked to the table next to me (because that's what you do when you don't know what to order), and peaked at what they had.  I saw a lady's plate that had green pasta in it and my mouth said, ""THAT - I want that"".  So I asked the waitress what it was and she said it was the Chicken Tequila Pasta, which just so happen, is one of their popular dishes.  Well, I didn't know that because I was stuck on my Veggie Pizza and Garlic Fettuccine all these years.   Did I like it?  Oh yes I did.  I may have added another ""favorite"" choice of dish when we make the next trek here.   This CPK is quite smaller than the Kahala Mall and somewhat similar than the Ala Moana one.  Located at Pearlridge Shopping Center Downtown, parking has never been a problem during dinner, especially when the mall is closed.  The best parking to get is the one directly across the street above CPK in the covered garage.   I have been to this location many times and never had a bad experience.  The staff is always pleasant and we never feel rushed.  Even though sometimes I wanna rush people out who's talking story while we're the ones waiting for a table to open up. Haha.   Tip: Download the CPK app, and register for their rewards.  For every $100 you spend, you get $5 credit towards your next visit.  You also get a gift on your birthday and notifications of specials.   This is one of my husband and kid's favorite places so I'm definitely a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=20,3.96,3.8,3.728,3.152,3.864

They go out of their way to take care of you and make sure everything is perfect!  The food is delicious and brought to you The minute it's ready! If your server is busy they will have someone else bring the food to you. You always get your food hot from the oven literally! Parking is variable depending on the time of day. Parking is shared with PearlRidge shopping center. So parking is first come first serve basis. We usually don't have any problems with parking. I like the fact the parking is free! My suggestion is that you get the California pizza kitchen app because they offer discounts and deals through their app.  All the pizzas and food are delicious! My ultimate favorite is their thai crunch salad. I will actually crave that salad if I don't eat it after a while. They also offer a wide variety of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks. One of my favorite seasonal drinks they have right now is the beehive sangria.  They also have a nice selection of beers on draft. They also have another one of my favorite seasonal beers on tap and that is the Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer.

First of all, they do not do reservations and you dont have to worry about parking since this is located in the mall.  (Of course not including holiday seasons when its packed haha) Tonight we came on Wednesday around 6:45pm. We were quoted a 30 minutes wait and recieved our buzzer which can only reach as far as fun factory which where we killed time for my 2 year old. We were seated around our quoted time and were welcomed. Right away we were offered drinks and sat our party of 8. Tonight was a fundraiser for HPU's graduating nursing class where 20% of the bill went straight to them. Great fundraiser CPK! Got us co-workers out for this occassion. Overall service was excellent as we were constantly checked on and did not feel rushed. Favorite recommendations are the spinach artichoke dip, BBQ chicken salad with avacado, BBQ chicken pizza, salmon, flat breads or their fettuccine pasta. Although we did not get everything I listed tonight, all of our food was fresh, hot and came out within 15 minutes. We also were served bread with its olive oil/pepper/balsamic within 5 minutes of ordering our drinks and entrees.  I also loved how one of the managers came coming to our table and other tables to help out whether it was grabbing things we needed or clearing the table which i love to see as opposed to seeing managers talking story doing nothing at other restaurants. Always a great experience here! *Kids always get a kids cup with lid and straw, kids menu and crayons! (Always a plus!) *Bathrooms are available of course but stalls are a bit tight *They do take out! Can't stay?

The Lettuce Wraps with Chicken were tasty as well.  I had ordered a drink, the Mint Icicle, when we ordered our appetizers but did not receive it until a bit after our main course arrived. The drink was good but was a bit too strong alcohol wise.  Maybe they made it stronger because it took so long, I don't know but all I was told from our server when I was still waiting for it was, ""I haven't forgotten your drink, our bartender is just backed up.""  Our main course was the Hawaiian Pizza which was amazing! Even though there wasn't much sauce, the other toppings made up for the taste. The pineapple was amazingly fresh and tasty!  My husband got the BBQ Chicken Pizza and he had them add on bacon. It was quite good as well, but we would omit the bacon next time because all the other ingredients were so flavorful that you couldn't taste the bacon much.  He also had the Mango Iced Tea which was really good.  Overall, the food was good, service was friendly. Only 4/5 stars because the drink took so long and arrived after our main course was half way consumed.  Would we eat her again?

88,Kehaulani H.,"Kapolei, HI",263,35,45.0,2.0,2016-12-30,"Our evening at CPK started pretty good! Waited a little longer than the time given but we were ok. During the time waiting, it flew by pretty fast as we were talking stories and taking photos.  After we were seated our waitress came by and introduced herself as Rachel. We ordered drinks and appetizers . She brought us waters and shortly after a decent amount of time our appetizers (spinach dip & egg-rolls) were dropped to our table by I'm guessing a food runner who was by the way, really professional & nice (he should have been our server). We asked him if they still offered the complimentary bread (because none was offered to us)? He responded ""oh yah sure I'll bring some right over"" which he did. We also had to ask for side plates for our appetizers & bread because none were dropped to our table by our server. As we ordered our dinner Rachel recommended the spinach asparagus pasta and to add-on chicken and to have it with garlic cream sauce which is her favorite (didn't mention it cost more, she made it seem as if it was an included option). Appetizers were really good but then our dinner came and that was a different story. I'm guessing it was different cooks from appetizers. Our pasta was super dry as if it was spinach and asparagus just tossed in with noodles, no seasoning, no sauce, maybe a drop of olive oil. As our waitress walked by, I informed her of our pasta having  no sauce and no taste at all. Which she didn't even bother to look at or examine. She responded with offense and said ""oh I can order a side of the garlic cream sauce"". She left our pasta to get cold on our table while we waited for the sauce. She passed our table a couple times serving other tables. The 3rd time passing she stopped and mentioned ""sorry it will be out soon, they're cooking the sauce"". Then My husband and I proceeded to show her how dry it was and lifted the pasta with our forks and tablespoons so she could see for herself and at that time I mentioned politely ""oh, I think they just forgot to add the sauce"" she got offended and said ""I did punch it in and ordered it with sauce!"". Now at this point by her defensive response, we're thinking, did she forgot to order it but didn't want to admit it because she was the very one who recommended it. We turn to our 6yr old who ordered the mac n cheese which had no sign of cheese on pasta, nor did it have any smudged of cheese on plate or spoon. Our poor kid was having a hard time to eat his mac n cheese (photo attached). He had to take a drink with every bite to wash it down because it was so dry. Finally the garlic cream sauce gets delivered and our spinach asparagus pasta with the added chicken is super cold. The pizza our daughter ordered was okay (it could have used more tomato/pasta sauce). By now we're so over it and so hungry we just ate part of our dinners to fill our hunger, asked for the check and wanted to get out of there. But our 6yr old asked for a kids sundae (which is .99 cents if a kids meal is ordered). While we were waiting for his sundae we asked for boxes. We decided to take food home and fix it (photo attached)! Rachel insisted to box our food. After the 3rd time me saying ""no, we'll take the Togo boxes and we'll box them ourselves"" she finally said ok. The vibe we received, we didn't trust her wrapping up our food in the back! At some point she mentioned ""I'll have the manger remove the cost for the sauce!"" I responded ""oh, it cost for the sauce?""  Because not once did she mention it would be an added charge. Anyway, we receive our bill and she charged full price for kids sundae when it was supposed to be .99 cents if ordering a kids meal. I bring it to her attention showing her both the kids menu with price & our bill which she totally played dumb and looked at both menu and check back & forth. She then mentions ""I wonder why it's like that, I punch it in the same way all the time."" Finally at the end she said she was able to figure it out. (Figure what out? I believe she purposely charged the regular amount).  In the past, food and service was always pretty good! Never had a problem before. This experience will prevent us from returning to this location. We'll continue to dine at the Alamoana location and we'll be trying the Kapolei location when we visit the mall.  *Our waitress made our experience awful. I understand the food wasn't as good as in the past but with good genuine service our waitress could have turned everything around quite easy.  *We still left gratuity at 10% after bad service (normally we leave 20% on average to good service).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=80,3.44,3.68,3.696,2.9840000000000004,3.5840000000000005

I called to complain later and Eva was nice enough to send me a $15 gift card. I appreciate that, but I went to another location to use it. Eva said on the phone that a lot of people complain about Rachel. I'm not surprised. Don't know why she hasn't gotten fired yet if she hates her job that much. I work in food service too and I would definitely be fired if I acted that way. This left a bad taste in my mouth. I left angry and won't be coming back any time soon.

There were 2 workers in the front, a male and a female, I walked in with no greeting, no smile. I waited as they finished up whatever they were doing. As I was waiting another lady came to the podium and told them how many were in her party and they took down her information first. Usually it's common sense, if you walk in and see someone waiting,  you'd ask the person if they checked in. But she didn't. I didn't make a big deal out of it because I was with the kids. After the lady left, I went right where she was, and those two acted as if I wasn't there. I mean I was right in front of them looking at them. As I was waiting, they were talking amongst themselves, and then the girl left!! After she left the guy was writing something down. I kept looking at him, with no response. Finally, a manager had to come and she took down my info. She was nice, but it didn't make up for what happened in the beginning when I first walked in.  We waited for 30-40 minutes before getting a table. The kids were restless and I couldn't wait to eat. The waitress that we had was good, but I forget her name. We ordered avocado egg rolls, the kids got mac and cheese and pasta with Alfredo sauce, I got a salad and my parents got pizza and pasta (I forget the names of the dishes). The kids' food was OK.

Having been newly blessed from Sunday mass bringing me closer to enlightenment and forgiveness to anyone who crosses me, my gal and I set off to find food to compliment the afternoon. We decided on a light lunch of salad from California Pizza Kitchen at Mililani, but by the time we finalized the decision to eat at CPK, we were around the Pearl Ridge area. On a typical day, in a typical restaurant, with a typical party of two, the host or in our case the manager--usually a person who dresses differently from the standard uniform of the establishment--seats the party at a table, past other large empty tables, past​ the bar and the kitchen, next to an fire exit and a family of five or more, whose table is part of the family's table arrangement. However, I am not the typical party and our host did not ask if the location was acceptable. Once seeing where the table was, I demanded another location where the attention of service I required can be furnished. The host dared inquire what was wrong and I politely requested a venue within the main dining hall. In doing so, he seated us next to a window at a table perfect for a party of two (about 2.5 ft by 3.5 ft). By this time, I have been scorned and I was compelled by the spirit of vengeance. The following events could have been worse had it not been for my girlfriend's presence and insistance of accepting the situation. Ha! The meal started off with a Sangria honey concoction, which I sent back because the wine was unrefreshingly gross. I replaced it with some sort of mint mojito--it was forgettable. One full size Chinese Chicken Salad, Lemon Grass Chicken whose sauce tasted the same as Panda's Tofu and Eggplant, and a sausage pepperoni pizza--another forgettable paper thin crust pizza. By the time the salad plate came to our table, the realestate all were diminished. The manager eventually made his way to our table and inquired about our experience so far. I politely explained we no longer have table room for the other dishes we ordered. He then frantically started looking for a larger replacement table for fear of cancelled orders. We ended up moving to that table in the midst of eating our chicken salad with my drink in hand! By the time the meal was finished and the bill came and went, my satisfaction of a larger table located in the middle of the room was fulfilled. I just wish the meal was memorable and exceptional. Perhaps in this occasion, it was CPK that had it's final laugh; me deviating from my original plan of just a Chinese Chicken salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea,3.56,3.6,3.628,3.1440000000000006,3.5840000000000005

Five minutes later a different server came by again with a spinach and artichoke appetizer trying to drop it off to our table. I told her again this is not what we ordered as our appetizer. The staff seemed very disorganized, not even knowing what each of the customers ordered and who to bring the food to!  Our avocado club rolls were brought out and were quite tasty. My daughter really enjoyed them. The chicken piccata was OK needed more seasoning and tasted on the bland side.

Whenever I get to chose a place to eat, everyone knows I'll always say cpk.. tonight tho, I'm truly disappointed and this experience just changed everything I thought I knew about this place... We walked in about half an hour ago, i would say this is one of the slowest I've ever seen this particular location. Anyway, got seated and was ready to order because duhhhhh were regulars here....  our server tonight is Danielle, she seems new. She took our drink orders as well as our food order. Longer wait than usual for water, but I get it she's probably new and figuring out a system.  Soooo, we ordered our usual garlic cream fettuccini with chicken, and his with shrimp and mushroom.. around a 20 minute wait and the food comes out, as soon as we take the first bites we both notice something is missing the sauce is bland and the noodles are strangely cardboardish (rubbery, undercooked) so we wait for the waitress to come back and kindly let her know that the pasta is not to standard, they are missing a main ingredient GARLIC... so she goes back to the kitchen to get us more sauce?! Welllllp she comes out with ""sauce"" basically straight garlic literally chopped up garlic!!!!  We have now ruined our pasta by adding the sauce before tasting it! I'm just in awe of this whole situation, so I kindly ask her to just make new ones!!!  Well here we are, just waiting for the new pasta to come out and guess what? They forgot the mushrooms!!! You'd think that after all this mess about the pasta they wouldn't forget to get it right, right????  We are currently waiting for them to bring out the side of mushrooms so we can continue to eat, but we're already full from eating and stopping so the food settled, and of course the spinach and artichoke dip.... sighhhh I'm so bummed because I know this will probably be the last time my boyfriend will ever bring me here.... The only reason for the 3 stars is because I know our waitress is trying, I know the food mess ups aren't her fault, and the manager sam tonight did a good job in following up with us, he personally delivered the pasta and made sure the sauce was right, and when he found out about the mushrooms he came back and apologized and offered to take care of the bill, which was good because it softened the situation. He didn't want us to pay for a meal we didn't enjoy and we couldn't agree more.... so big ups to the manager tonight he handled the situation very well, and showed that he really cares about his customers and the service...  Overall, this is one of my favorite spots to eat, and I'm sure my boyfriend will never bring me back here, but I will probably be back with my family and friends because when they're on top of things the food is amazing as well as the drinks... I wouldn't say not to go here because at times they do get it all right, but there are times like these as well.... may the odds be ever in your favor",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea?start=20,3.8,3.63,3.608,3.436,3.698

If it's just yourself eating, I suggest the half size, the full is huge! But that could just be me.  Spinach Artichoke Dip - my favorite! Definitely get as an appetizer to share with the table.  Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza - this has a little kick, but is very flavorful! Usually can't finish this myself, but it's okay you can always have leftovers.  Lettuce Wrap (w/ Chicken) - also refreshing if you're not up for a salad. The sauce is really good, put some on your wrap.  Strawberry Shortcake (w/ Ice Cream) - its summer... so it's in season!! GET IT BEFORE ITS GONE! Pretty much a biscuit with strawberries and yummy cold ice cream.  Tuna Egg Roll (only in Hawaii, shown in photo) - OMG IF LOVE TUNA, try this one!

The wait time is usually long--especially when attempting to be seated during their peak times (lunch & dinner). Yet, even if seated early, service is consistently hit-or-miss as well.  However, I can say that my experience today seems to show signs of CPK upping their customer service experience game. We arrived at 1:30pm on a busy Saturday and was told by the friendly hostess that the wait time would be 10-15 minutes. Happily, we were sat at the 7 minute mark. We were instantly greeted by our server and our dining experience began. Drink and appetizer orders were put in and bread and waters were brought out instantly. I was impressed by the high visibility of their floor manager--she was carrying out plates to the tables and checking on customers as well. Our food arrived at a good pace: our always-a-guarantee go-to Shrimp & Chicken lettuce wraps arrived with our kids' favorite--Artichoke Dip. During the time it took for us to enjoy it, our plates were cleared to make room for our main meals; nothing felt hurried.  I ordered the newly-added item Seared Ahi Chop Salad: WINNING! Gluten-free AND healthy AND delicious!  I'd highly recommend this. My daughter ordered a margharita pizza and the manager profusely apologized, explaining that the pizza was not up to their standard and thus, would drop the pizza with us and make another one that would be up to par. It was awesome to have the manager immediately acknowledge this shortfall and have a solution tied to it. Much appreciated!! In the end, our experience was great.

I saw some tables open but maybe the servers/cooks were behind and needed to catch up which is understandable. So the wait was about 10-15 mins or so which isn't so bad since they give you the pagers (if I remember) to call you when you're ready.  -While being sat the waitress quickly brought out our waters then scurried off elsewhere. I can't say if she was slammed or what but I can just base this review off of my own experience. The bread was a bit hard and cold but at least the olive oil it came with helped it push along. We offered cocktails which took awhile to come out honestly considering, and at the start I asked for some Parmesan cheese which didn't come out for another 15mins. The cocktails were actually good and the appetizer which was a mushroom flatbread was also good. If you're a mushroom lover I'd recommend it. -Now for the entrees, that took quite awhile. Like, I honestly should have timed it but I tried to occupy myself with other things. It was definitely over 25-30 mins and this was AFTER our appetizers had arrived! Now I know it takes awhile for good food, but my steak was undercooked. I wanted med rare and most of the steak was still mooing! I was just starving by that point so I ate the med rare parts of it and figured I could save it for home and cook it to my correct temp. My girlfriends entree was a shrimp scampi and it was way to sour. Like they poured on the lemon juice and she couldn't enjoy some of the veggies mixed in it as it was way too sour. I ended up finishing it for her as I didn't want to waste food. Other then all of this the steak actually had pretty good flavor and if it was cooked perfectly it would have been great I'd even recommend getting it.  -Honestly, if the food takes that long I'd expect the steak to be cooked perfectly and not undercooked.

When I got in the reasturant I was seated very quickly by someone who I assumed was off the clock because he was not on uniform and had a backpack on.  I noticed the group of 2 that came in right before me was also seated in Bob's section and the table that came on after me was also seated in Bob's section.  Leading me to belive he was the only server working at the time.  VERY GOOD SERVICE.  I worked in the reasturant industry before I and understand how stressful have a bunch of table can be but he still took tome with me to help me figure out which tea I would like. (I was in the mood for a sweet tea)  I ended up ordering the mango tea (which is refillable !!!)  He double checked that I enjoyed the drink and took my food order.  Food came out on a decent amount of time. I didn't time it but it felt about 15 mintues and I was given bread and this made time go by a little faster because I was HUNGRY. I had the white corn guacamole I highly recommend it. Very good chip to guac ratio and o loved the texture of it. I also ordered a margarita pizza. It came out at the perfect temp so I didn't have to wait for it to cool off like how I would normally would at a pizza reasturant.  Next time I will be coming in and asking for bob as a server again and hopefully I'll have time to try dessert!!

I am particularly a fan of this location because of the amazing service. There have been a couple misses where my server forgot to put my take out order in before the kitchen closed, or when my server wasn't too friendly, but 9 times out of 10, this place shines in terms of customer service.  I really enjoy the food here, too. My usual order is the California club sandwich with chicken and tortilla soup. I am never disappointed because the balance is great. I also fancy the Thai crunch salad, the spinach and artichoke dip, the pesto pasta with chicken, and the Sicilian pizza. I can never really go wrong when I go with one of these things. Their mango lemonade or strawberry iced tea is also delicious. I like that this place has a seasonally changing menu, which allows me to try new things out when I am not ordering from the list above.  Since this CPK is located at Pearlridge, it is very convenient to get to. Sometimes the waits are long (they don't take reservations), which can be a hassle especially if you are hungry, but the time usually goes by fast.

20,Michelle P.,"Honolulu, HI",150,97,443.0,4.0,2017-11-25,They are located in the Pearlridge Mall and there's a lot of parking you can chose from. On our recent visit we went on a Sunday morning around 11 am and we didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated quickly and to my husband's delight he was able to watch his football game from our area. Our server was friendly but he did take a while to come back with water and our check since they were short staffed. He did keep apologizing for taking a while and since they were short staffed we were understanding.       They give you bread with olive oil for starters and we usually ask for balsamic vinegar to add to the olive oil. I feel they skimp on the bread now but it was fine for me because the less bread I see the less temptation I have. Lol. But of course my husband wanted more bread so we got three more pieces hahaha! We ordered their lettuce wraps for appetizers this time but we usually get their spinach and artichoke dip. I was kind of disappointed with the lettuce wraps because the meat was kind of salty for my taste. We got their Club Sandwich with chicken and tomato bisque to share. For lunch I feel that was enough food so I wasn't too stuffed. Now they have this program that you can sign up for and it keeps track of how much you spend there and you get food or money back when you spend a certain amount.      I hope the next time we go they aren't so short staffed but overall good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-aiea,4.0,3.68,3.7,,3.8080000000000003

She refilled our drinks 1x, our coke was flat, never gave us any extra bread, never cleaned up Our plates but she checked on everybody else at the bar too besides us, THEN she had the audacity to talk story to another guest for half an hour, yes, half an hour might seem dramatic but we were timing her because the service we were getting was very horrible and how I watched other servers working harder then the bartender had me a little irritated. I'm pregnant & I wished I sat on a table instead, then after she's done talking, she reaches over & grabs my pizza without even saying excuse me or asked if I'm done or if I need a box(HOW RUDE), & she says ""Oh I thought you were waiting on me.""
