74,Sarah N Felipe H.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,1,,1.0,2012-05-18,"So many people love this place, but not one thing was special about it.  I think it is because so many people are addicted to sugar and their pizza crust was overly sweet.  Nothing special about their pizza offerings.  Their salads are a meh and too salty.   My husband also needs gluten free so this is one reason why we chose this place.  Well they did not happen to have it that day and the waiter treated us like we were pains.  He doesn't seem to keen on giving us other options on their menu.  So hubby goes for fish tacos and they are fried...so much for that.   The waiter is the main reason why I give it a one star.  Ahole. get another job",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=80,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724

It was all about the first impression and I let my... emotions... cloud my better judgement.  Will you give me another chance? During our first date, I didn't know about your fish tacos. I didn't even ask. To be fair, I was rushed. You were really sketchy and nervous, and it was awkward. I can look back on it with some perspective now, I mean it was a blind date, neither of us trusted the person that set us up, I figured you thought my Corolla was shabby so I was on the defensive... But can I just tell you: I still don't really like you, but if you make me more of those fish tacos, I'll totally compromise my better judgement. For those panko-battered nuggets of Ono heaven, drowned in your ""ranchito"" sauce and covered in layers of cabbage and avocado, I'd let you take advantage of me. I would, and I wouldn't have a complex the next day because you're from California so you're used to that kind of thing. And I don't know what happened, but during our second date, you were SO different.

Where shall I start??? How about with the service that's always a good starting point- well to be brutally honest the service was awful.

Sorry for been considerate didn't realize that was a bad thing :/  The second server failure was when our food arrived and we got the wrong pizza :/ so while everyone was tucking into there food my husband had to sit and watch and wait ok so mistakes happen I guess. The manager was great at following up kudos there. Your lack of thought on getting refills was just another example of the lack of service and having to wait a ridiculous amount of time to pay was just the icing on the cake.  Onto the food well it was just sub par nothing special, I usually over eat at CPK because the food is to delicious to pass up on another slice and an other and an other ok so you get the point, but tonight not so much 2 slices and I was done the flavor just wasn't there and the pizza was soggy.

But we (my mom, my brother and I)  were such in good spirits after purchasing a new iphone from the Apple store near this CPK restaurant that we didnt mind the wait.  It was quite busy that day, so maybe thats why the service suffered a little bit.  Out server was a little bit confused when sitting us. Apparently he was instructed to sit us at a certain table but that table was still dirty. He quickly found us another table though. He was also quick in providing us menus and getting out drinks and taking our orders. But he was rushed and forgot to provide my brother a drinking straw and it was hard to get his attention to this minor detail.  Also I've noticed that as compared to the other CPKs Ive been to (I travel accross US alot), this chain is subpar. It was too crowded, like they tried to fit in as many tables as they can compromising the ambience of the restaurant. It was also a full house that day so it was a bit loud with too many people. Another thing is their napkins. Other CPKs use real, cloth napkins, this establishment doesn't. They use brown, recycled paper napkins, which cheapens the whole dining experience. Anyways, shortly after giving our orders (like 10-15seconds later), we decided to ask for the menu again to order a pizza in addition to out previous orders of 3 jambalaya pasta and a share appetizer of chips and spinach/artichoke dip. The server was like ""okaayy.. Are you sure? If you say so,"" in an offensive tone implying that we are ordering too much. We missed breakfast, waking up late, and it was already 130pm so we were starving. Besides, ordering more should be good for their business, right? During the meal, it was hard to get our server's attention for drink refills. He was busy running around tables.  The food.  Chips + spinach and artichoke dip: 3stars. Chips were bland, after a sprinkle of salt, it was alright. The dip was delicious. Will probably order again. California Club pizza. 3stars. The white sauce was extremely lacking, it was dry. Fresh parmessan was grated right in front of us. The greens in top were really fresh though and the leftover remained fresh hours after taking it to go. Will most likely not order again.  Jambalaya pasta. One of my fave CPK dish. It was still good, spicy. with generous seafood toppings in the sauce. We had the freshly grated parmessan on it as well.  Overall , we will only probably go back to this restaurant again when we feel the need to fulfill our Jambalaya pasta fix again as this is the only CPK in town. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.2760000000000007,3.6000000000000005

Also the prices are too high for what you get.  I have dined here on two occasions. Once for lunch and tonight for dinner. I typically like to wait before I review a restaurant, so I did. On my first visit, I had a lunch special with the salad and pizza, and my mother ordered a sandwich and salad. Both items were superb! I had the BBQ chicken pizza and a spinach and quinoa salad, and wow super yummy! I also had the mango iced tea which was great! My mom had the turkey and Brie, and she loved it (plus the salad but I can't remember which one).  Honestly, the food was so great we wanted to return! The prices were steep (like $15 per person), but we were satisfied. The service wasn't the best, but it had slightly improved near the end so we looked past it. We figured at least the girl was kind and was able to get us what we needed.  However, in search of somewhere to eat tonight I remembered that we had a special coupon for this place, and pizza sounded good and I was in the mood for a salad.  So since my dad had missed the last trip here, we decided to bring him there! We were greeted and seated right away, and our drink orders were taken quickly. Everything seemed to be going swell, but then I had requested a water for my mom... We waited and waited, but nothing. I decided since I had ordered a drink and a water I would just give her mine and wait for the new one. Finally about 12 minutes later, I see the girl (who I won't name) coming with the water.  She sees my mom has one and returns the water to the back. At this point, she comes and takes our order. We ordered a large pizza and full salad for us to share, and again I request a water. She takes our order back and we notice the table behind us who came in 10 minutes or more after us has already received their bread. I look at the girl (as she drops off their bread) and she goes to the kitchen and about 10 minutes later comes back with bread. She profusely apologizes for the delay and claims it's late because it had just come out of the oven. I again asked for water and she takes about 3 minutes but comes back with it. I ask for a straw, but long story short I never got one (thank god I had an extra straw in my purse). The food came (I might add super fast). We got the quickest food service! It was great, but honestly this has been probably the worst restaurant service experience I have had (due to her attitude and lack of service). The experience was so bad, I don't think my review would do it justice. Honestly for $20+ a person for dinner I will take my business elsewhere and get better service.

It was delicious and not too high on the weight watchers scale (this is my life right now).  The waitress was apologetic and attempted to right the wrong.  The pizza was delicious.  A nice departure from the chain delivery pizza places for sure.  Lighter fair too.   We will definitely be returning.  They have a patio area that would be great when the temperatures begin to cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.2800000000000002,3.92

13,Bob L.,"Rio Rancho, NM",49,302,783.0,5.0,2016-07-24,"This location os the very best CPK that I have been too, anywhere I California, and the funny thing is that its located in New Mexico! LOL This place looks the nicest of all CPK I have ever seen, its beautiful, perfectly maintained, has a proper sit-down restaurant look to it and is a comfortable environment to enjoy your evening in. The food is quite good and has a decent variety, with even more variety in its way, so its easy to find something for everyone. The very best part of this location is the service. This is the very best service of any CPK I have ever experienced, by far. Its more like the service in a five star restaurant. The staff is simply excellent. The Hostess greeted us with a smile, immediately welcomed us and got us to our table immediately. She made sure we were comfortable and made an effort to settle us into their lovely environment. Courtney, our waitperson, is charming, professional, kind, informative, patient and fast. We were exhausted from an all day outdoor event yesterday in one hundred degree weather. Not having seen a CPK menu in quite some time, it took a while for us to figure out what we wanted. To make it worse, we were so spent from all those ours in eh heat and sun that our brains just could not process the menu quickly yet Courtney patiently helped us muddle through it and gave us all the time we needed to get through it. Having just moved to New Mexico and getting lost on the way to Uptown, Courtney made us feel welcome to this State as well as to CPK. She exemplifies how service should be offered at a four and five star restaurant, and she sets the bar si very high for CPK. We intend on asking for her by name each time we visit CPK. She's that good. Courtney brought the dinner out so quickly I thought that I had just barely blinked my eye and her sunny smile was once again at our table, cheerfully serving and making sure that we were comfortable. The Garlic Cream Fettuccini was quite good and enjoyable as was the ""Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler"" (Fresh strawberries hand-shaken with Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava and ginger. Lite in calories too!), although it was a bit on the sweet side, it was definitely refreshing and the strawberries tasted like they came right out of the garden. This location has elevated CPK to the fine dining level, offering popular, yummy, meals. I you have not tried CPK do start with the BBQ chicken pizza, yes that really is a California thing (it was started in Los Angeles) and truly is quite tasty, but no matter which dish you go there for, you'll enjoy the excellent service environment that the manager of this location has created for you, he and his staff are to be commended on the excellence of their demeanor and service delivery which is what earned them five stars. Oh yes, there really is a Pokemon living in the outdoor seating area, he's rather friendly and is a good catch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.2840000000000003,3.92

I had to finally get up and approach him at the checkout and request my bill. I was so thirsty I asked for a to go water with lemon.

11,Misha L.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,9,3.0,5.0,2016-12-06,"As someone who works in the service industry, I expect without complaint, that when I visit a popular restaurant during peek hours I will likely get mediocre service and best. The food will probably also not look or taste as good as would were the cooks to have sufficient time to put a little more love in to each dish. Thus I try to avoid such establishments during these hours. But alas, at 1pm on Monday, I was almost hungry enough to eat the shoes I had just purchased next door. So, I went somewhere I'd never been with low expectations... just to put anything outside of footwear into my stomach. The place was pretty packed, so a wait would have been understandable. Yet we were sat within 2 minutes of walking in and greeted by our server, Michelle, immediately upon taking our seats. She had an obviously hefty work load, yet remained just the right amount of friendly and attentive without ever appearing overwhelmed. She was memorable and enjoyable but never over stayed her welcome at our table... there's a fine balance by my perspective, and it takes a skilled server to maintain it. She was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and it's detailed ingredients and willing to modify it to accommodate my fancy pants taste buds. Our drinks stayed full throughout. The food arrived in a timely manner and was absolutely with out flaw. I can say without hesitation that it was officially the very best gluten free pizza I've had in Albuquerque. So good, in fact, that I was far too busy eating it, to take a picture of it. Not to worry, I'll be back! Given the quality of the food and service, it was also very reasonably priced. This was an obviously well managed restaurant with quality people cooking and serving the food. Way to go CPK...

(I actually had to open the sandwich to verify there was any chicken there at all!) More coleslaw than meat. Also, the bread they put it on was tasty but, perhaps because of the preponderance of coleslaw, it was starting to dissolve halfway through eating it and the whole thing became very messy.

What I did have was very tasty and fresh.  I was seated right away, our waiter was nice but the service was slow. It took over 30 minutes to get our meal. Unacceptable for a busy lunch place.  But the reason for 2 stars is the menu. New law requires calories to be listed next to the dish on the menu. As I was pouring over the menu looking for a low calorie option, I saw the artichoke pizza was only 190 calories. Finally, I saw that the count was for 1 slice and that each pizza has 6 slices. So the personal pizza really has over 1100 calories!

Sweet and spicy, with crispy bacon and delicious peppers/onions. I like to order this with extra sauce. Also, when craving pasta, I order the chicken tequila fettuccine.  There was a shift manager here a while ago by the name of Pete, and he was the best. Entertaining, accommodating, and a pleasant person overall. Sad to hear that he'd left. The Meh: Service here is a hit or miss, sadly. You get seated almost immediately, but sometimes it takes a while for someone to actually approach your table. On my most recent visit, my bf and I waited over 15 minutes before someone came to our table outside and asked, ""You haven't been helped yet right?"" We ended up moving inside, due to wind. My water was never refilled, and I had to request it from the manager standing by the register (what we were eating was really spicy).
