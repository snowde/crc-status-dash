205,Debra F.,"Alpharetta, United States",0,23,,1.0,2014-08-10,"The review is based on service, not the food. I've been eating at CPK since it opened in Atlanta and not once have eaten a bad meal. Tonight though for the second time thru their online ordering I ran into an issue with pickup. I've already complained once to the mgr about on time delivery and she was very kind and sent coupons for a couple meals about a year ago. The issue I have is that the problems are not corrected. I appreciate my free meal , but if nothing changes in the curbside pickup I will have to take my business elsewhere permanently. I went tonight to pick up my order that I placed 45 minutes earlier in the evening and set the time to pick up at 7:30. I get to the pick up curb and call in. They tell me it will be out when ready. Ok...it should be ready since I was right on time at 7:29 and the order was placed 45 minutes earlier. I sat for 10 minutes in my car and still no order. I got out of my car which is the entire reason for me to go to Curbside Pick up and enter the restaurant, headed straight to the pick up area where they were completing my order. I was very nice and the woman completing the order apologized saying the order was on the house ; however, after I got home I realized I had charged the order already when I placed the order online. So she must be laughing at me right now since I had already paid! Well I plan on disputing my charge on my credit card now because she told me it was free for my troubles. The point of this message is CPK I hope you read the reviews here because YOU ALL MUST FIX the problems at your pickup/curbside service and be on time. The restaurant was given 45 minutes to get its act together and then the other 10 minutes while I waited in my car which is absolutely inexcusable. I will try one more time and if it happens again then I'm done forever with CPK. Its obviously not well managed otherwise this would not keep occurring. Hire more people for that area ,hire people that are more organized. Whatever the issue it must be fixed.

I'm not a huge pizza: mostly because I get sick of generic combinations and ingredients that taste unsavory and bland. I was really impressed with the menu and the flavor combinations really interesting. I have the California club pizza and it was so delicious I can't believe I finished the whole thing. The dining room was very clean and neat.  There was no stickiness, no food on the floor, and nothing was in disarray... It was refreshing to walk into a restaurant where they take pride in maintaining a clean and comfortable dining experience Just a couple of side notes for the staff:    We got our drinks very promptly but it was mostly filled to the top with ice-very little of the beverage was actually in there. I felt weird always asking for a refill but if you took the amount of ice out of the glass you would've noticed that the vessel only contained 30% of tea.    It's always distracting when there are loud and noisy children.  I wish that a lot of restaurants would get on board with segregating families from adult patrons. I know that's not realistic but it's upsetting when you can't have a conversation across the table with someone because of a screaming toddler 6 feet away.

The management staff was always present interacting with guests and teammates to make sure things were running smoothly and I appreciated seeing that they really cared about what was going on in the restaurant. Chris and Miguel absolutely slayed it in the kitchen and made the best pizzas my friend and I have had in a long time (I can't believe it was vegan and tasted that good), cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. It was very cool to get to watch them do their thing - since the restaurant features an open kitchen you get to check out all the behind the scenes stuff and really get a feel for everything that goes in to making your food come out perfect.

9,Cassandra R.,"Roswell, GA",0,4,21.0,5.0,2017-06-16,"I had been wanting to eat the food of California Pizza Kitchen for so long. The thought of tasting a gourmet pizza of this type that is not like fast food pizza whether Cici's Pizza or Papa John's or Little Caesar's.  In addition, I was a little excited to be around a more upscale atmosphere that I don't know, I just got the feeling the place exuded when I would pass it by. Was I right! I made my way there as a second option I was wanting to try out when Dave & Buster's loud and inattentive service failed to impress me.  Still good for me because I wanted so badly to try one of their gourmet pizzas and eat either some cheesecake or red velvet cake which I researched they served.  I'm a quiet person and like to keep to myself so preferably I want a restaurant that is quiet & low-key. Especially as I am simply there for the food. And I want to savor every morsel. Slowly too, just so that I can taste it fully. And as a matter of fact I can't understand people who go to restaurants with big parties since if you are socializing, how are you enjoying your food? I would never do it since if I'm going to restaurant it is for the food and nothing else. Not even to talk or chat with the waiters.  Anyway. I was tremendously glad when I arrived at around 8:45 PM give or take, that the atmosphere of the place was quiet and was pretty elegant looking. Even the outside with soft yellow lighting which contrasted wonderfully with the building. Right off: impressed. Next since I have never dined at a casual dining restaurant of the scale of California Pizza Kitchen I was a little worried to how I will approach someone about getting seated. It was not hard at all. I got seated (I mentioned yes I was dining by myself) and was told Breanna would be my server although I was assisted by her assistant, Kate.  And Kate was really nice and did a terrific job though she said she was still relatively new as a server. I thought she was very attentive and nice. Especially as she left me to my own devices to enjoy my food and would still come assist me when I needed to ask something.  But let's get on to it. What was my response to California Pizza Kitchen's food at Alpharetta GA North Point Dr? It was delicious and just as I imagined. First off the Strawberry Mango Cooler I ordered was so refreshing and sour. Perfect! I love sour flavors. Next, the red velvet cake was incredibly soft, creamy, and moist. Definitely tasted better than store-bought. Oh, and before I forget the red velvet cake can be served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream at no extra charge. Wow! That's amazing! Finally, the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza was very mushroomy. It was on the organic-tasting side even though I ended adding salt and black pepper to it since in my opinion it needed better seasoning. Don't get me wrong. It was good but it needed more zest. I'm a huge believer that seasonings and spices add more flavor to food.  In any case, I was truly impressed by the attentive service and delicious food including the pizza. I certainly recommend and, of course, I myself will be returning to the restaurant whenever my top favorite musician TK from Ling tosite sigure announces an upcoming music release. As a way to celebrate that he'll be releasing new music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta,2.32,2.64,2.64,3.3480000000000003,2.512

The service was so prompt and friendly, my guest and I truly felt at home. There was a good selection of wine and house cocktails, and our drinks looked great and tasted better. The management staff was always present interacting with guests and teammates to make sure things were running smoothly and I appreciated seeing that they really cared about what was going on in the restaurant. Chris and Miguel absolutely slayed it in the kitchen and made the best pizzas my friend and I have had in a long time (I can't believe it was vegan and tasted that good), cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. It was very cool to get to watch them do their thing - since the restaurant features an open kitchen you get to check out all the behind the scenes stuff and really get a feel for everything that goes in to making your food come out perfect.
