Sometimes a good salad is a necessity and after a few days in the park, I am running to get the biggest bowl of greens I can find.  Luckily CPK was between the La Quinta and Disneyland. I was just run down on my last day in the park and decided to get take out before going back to the hotel to rest. After 10 minutes, my Smashed peas and barley soup and Moroccan Chicken Salad was ready. My stomach was angry and wanted nourishment quickly. The walk back to the hotel was arduous, but I made it. The soup was hot and creamy. The salad was filled with numerous ingredients and resembled the mountains that I create at Sweet Tomatoes. The only difference is they pay someone to come up with this intricate flavor combination. Spot on. Filled with chicken, beats, squash, dates, cranberries, carrots, scallions, romaine lettuce, and then tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. This is the only salad I get when I go to any CPK now.

We ordered mac n cheese bites and hummus to start with.  I don't really care for traditional macaroni and cheese, but holy cow those mac n cheese bites were outta this world!  The crunchy breading on those suckers is to die for.  The hummus was also right up there. I ordered a half roasted vegetable salad; artichokes, avocado, asparagus, eggplant, red & yellow peppers, corn, sun-dried tomatoes served warm over romaine and tossed with a Dijon mustard vinaigrette.  I really liked the warm/cool contrast.  IMHO, a half portion is still pretty big.   My sister had the Korean BBQ steak tacos and tortilla soup.  She commented that she has had better soup.  This one had the tortilla chips blended into the soup so it was kinda like a ""cream of tortilla"".

219,Kenneth N.,"Westminster, CA",1,23,,1.0,2012-04-13,"Went to this location last week with my girlfriend. This place is close to Disneyland. Parking is a pain because it's a structure, you take a ticket when you come in and you pay when you exit. First hour is free but it's still a hassle if you're only here for lunch. The food was probably the worst out of all the CPKs I've been to. The Miso Shrimp salad was tasteless, I think they skimmed on the sauce too much. The pizza was only okay. The waiter was bad. At the other CPKs when you order a salad they come to your table to put pepper on the salad for you. The server here didn't even ask us if we wanted pepper or not. Also at the other CPKs the manager goes to your table and ask you if like the food. Not here, the manager at this location was nowhere to be found. We tried asking for red pepper and cheese to go with our pizza and the waiter forgot about our request. This place is extremely understaffed when we were there. It's not even crowded, we saw about 10-15 people there including us and the chef had to take the food to the tables because there were not enough waiters. Service was extremely slow. It took them a good 15 minutes to scan our credit card and print out a slip for us to sign. Needless to say I won't be coming back.

197,Charlotte K.,"Anaheim, CA",19,18,3.0,3.0,2012-05-03,"After class one day, my roommates and I decided to go out to lunch before I had work. Me having the allergies and being picking when it comes to where we eat, they left the decision up to me. I decided on California Pizza Kitchen in Garden Walk. I had eaten at this particular location before and knew they had gluten free pizza and I really wanted pizza so we agreed to go there. You can imagine how annoyed I was when I found out that this location no longer had the gluten free crust. The waitress explained that there was a recent change in ownership and they dropped it for the time being and I don't know for sure if they will be bringing it back, but it was good when I had it before. They do have little 'gluten free' logos next to the items in the menu so you know what is gluten free. I ended up getting a salad. The caramelized peach salad. Although the peaches were not caramelized there were just grilled, it was still really good. It comes with Gorgonzola cheese, but I asked for no cheese. It was also really big too. They have a half size and the full size and the full size is $11 or so but it was worth it. I was expecting it to cost more so to me it was worth the price. And afterwards I rushed to costuming to change and go to work. -Charlotte ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.668,3.3600000000000003

However, my coworkers and I come here from time to time for birthday lunches. CPK has lots of variety so everyone can eat happy, and it's a good place to go for a group meal. However, a gripe about CPK in general is that they've raised some of their prices since I last went, so it's pretty pricey for a small thin-crusted pizza now. Your meal will probably cost around $15 for lunch, more for dinner! But, CPK pizza is delicious and does not disappoint.

She was very nice, handed the menus to us and gave us a few moments to figure out what to order.  The person who started serving our food was the manager. He was nice and professional. The avocado spring rolls are the best appetizers they have. Try them if you have not already. As for the pizza, it is good and filling. After we got our food, our waitress checked on us at times just to make sure we needed anything.

The first time we went was during lunch and while the restaurant was relatively empty, we did not feel like the servers were being lazy or like we were being overly loud or anything. Most seemed to order one of the salads and all have rave reviews. I do not remember the name of my salad but it had cold and warm components including corn, avocado, and artichoke and it was delicious. When we returned the second time for dinner there was about a 30 minute wait but it was kind of expected during dinner at a big convention. We ordered some more substantial entrees which included pizza and pasta all of which were good, nothing spectacular but nothing was bad either.  What really puts this location over the top was the fantastic service. Both times we had the same waiter and he was magnificent. He took custom orders, took mistakes back to the kitchen apologetically, asked us about our meal, and split the checks individually without being snarky. He also recommended we sign up for the app which enabled all of us to get a free small plate and gave us a free desert. At chain restaurants like CPK where the food is more or less the same service is make or break in the experience and our server made the experience great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=160,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.22,3.0400000000000005

When we were finally seated, our dinner of hell began.  First of all, our waiters kept switching and we had no utensils throughout the night. I had to get up and take the utensils set on one of the other tables... after asking for utensils 4 times. Refills on drinks? Don't even ask... or do... but prepare for them to forget about 6 times before actually doing it. Top the night off, we were seated outside and mid-dinner we had COCKROACHES on the umbrella next to our table and a few underneath our feet!! THEY WERE ALIVE AND KICKIN'!

Hubby and I always split a pizza and salad which are very good, the roasted veggie salad as well as the quinoa salad are excellent.  This time we had the artichoke, spinach, and garlic thin crust pizza.  It is my new favorite.

268,Jeremiah S.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,125,11.0,1.0,2013-09-18,After getting seated we showed the yelp coupon of $10 off $40. After doing so we sat arround as our confused waitress blatently ignored us. So we are off to a super crappy start to dinner. Manager finally came by to explain how the coupon worked. I told him we know how they work its your waitress who is confused and ignoring us now. 20 minutes since showing a stupid coupon and we can finally order water. Finally got to order 30 mins after arrival. Sure glad that coupon through yelp was easy to use. Its 15 mins later and twice food not belonging to us has been delivered and here we wait no food. 50 mins since entering no food that was ordered 20 mins ago. Its wednesday with less than half the tables filled. We ordered a pizza and pasta. It would be less headache to go home and make it myself. So far the most awful service I have had in years. If you get the misfortune of comming here for dinner try for the view of the brick oven. I just watched a pizza burn to a crisp. At no time did anyone even notice. It was probably mine. Well at 1 hour 5 mins the manger brought our food. Still waiting for my tea refill from 25 mins ago. Food at least looks good. My wifes spaghetti bolognese with sauce has a ton of pasta and a tiny amount of sauce...tiny. I ordered the jambalaya fettucini. Its very tasty overall. I just do not like tails on shimp in pasta. We also shared a hand tossed pepperoni mushroom sausage pizza. The crust is outstanding. It should be called two handfuls of mushrooms a couple pepperonis and 3 sausage chunks pizza. . Great crust. We will be taking the red velvet cake home. Well maybe. It was forgoten it seems. So reordering that. Now it seems the coupon was not used the waitress is confused and here we wait on the manager once again. So no. Cake and overcharged about $20. So far... well on my 4th receipt. All were wrong. Now up at the take out with manager tring to fix the ticket and add the missing red velvet cake to the bill. Who knows we might actually get it sometime tonight to take home. A complete waste of 1 hour 30 mins. Still waiting for the bill and cake. Got bill now can not pay the stupid thing. Screw the cake take the money so I can leave this........................finally was able to pay the bill revised by the manager for the 6th time. I paid cash and I guess the waitress assumed the change was her tip since she never came back with my change. I was gojng for no tip but she decieded to keep the $2 and change so be it. After asking 3 other people not my waitress or the manager who went into hiding I got the cake that was partially melted. From walk in the door and seated to finally forcing them to let me pay so I could leave to 1 hour 53 minutes. Should have taken 25-30 mins max.

Recently (though I'm not sure how recently, as I haven't been in about a year), they rolled out a new menu. New starters, new crust, new pizzas. Yuck. Why change something that is good, that people have grown love and expect? Yes, some of the new starters are pretty good. We had the avocado wrap things -- nice, crispy, flavorful -- and the mac and cheese bites. I must've missed where the mac and cheese things were stuffed fried nugget-like things. Nevertheless, they were pretty good, just luke-warm. I wouldn't order them again though, just a strong sense of being fried and clogging my arteries.  My issue comes down to the pizza. Some classic pizzas (like the BLT) are no longer on the menu. And the new dough is TERRIBLE. The pizza was so doughy, it became disgusting. I always finish my pizza, but instead I felt bloated with dough. Also, the dough used to have a slightly sweet taste. This had no flavor. Yuck.  I have no idea why CPK is trying to become something else -- why they are trying to reinvent themselves.

180,Erika L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",56,17,5.0,5.0,2014-01-05,"Gluten & Dairy Free!! I haven't gone to a cpk in years, since before my gluten/dairy free lifestyle. They are GIG approved so I had to try it. It did not disappoint, they had a gig approved menu. I ordered the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza with no cheese. It was really good, the crust a little on the sweet side but good. And I didn't get sick! The manager brought out the pizza and it had a little certified Gluten free stick in it. They have other gluten free items but they can't certify GF. If your as sensitive as me to cross contamination stick with the GIG menu. Also they offer crisp in GF cider. Below ill copy and past from   about what makes it gig approved:  1) The Gluten Intolerance Group of North American (GIG) certifies restaurants that use the strict procedures approved by GIG. There are currently four ""GIG certified"" items on the CPK menu. They include the pizzas listed on the small menu above: GF Margherita, GF Chicken Barbecue, GF Mushroom Pepperoni Pizza and GF Pepperoni. 2) To be a ""GIG certified"" GF menu item at CPK, the food must be prepared in the new GF dedicated part of the kitchen and all of the ingredients used on the pizza must be from that dedicated area. For example, I requested goat cheese on my son's pizza since we don't do cow' milk cheese. They could not certify his pizza because the goat cheese comes from another part of the kitchen that is not certified. 3) You can order a different style pizza not listed on the above menu with the GF crust, but it will not be ""GIG certified."" 4) They use a blue sticker as seen below to seal all pizzas that are considered ""certified."" 5) The manager is supposed to deliver any certified GF pizza. It is to be delivered upon completion, even if it's done before the rest of the table's food so that it does not sit around and potentially become contaminated with flour/gluten. The manager is also supposed to wash his/her hands before handling the pizza. 6) There are other menu items listed as ""GF"" on their regular menu. These dishes are not considered ""GIG certified."" They are free of gluten ingredients but are not prepared in the dedicated part of the kitchen. The white corn guacamole and chips listed on the menu below is an example of this. This basically means that the dish is free of gluten ingredients but they cannot guarantee against cross contamination of gluten. I have inquired with CPK as to whether the chips are fried in dedicated oil but have not heard back yet. 7) CPK now uses rice flour to work all their pizza dough including wheat flour dough. This prevents the very small airborne flour molecules from contaminating the dedicated part of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=200,3.56,3.37,3.37,3.188,3.446

For my meal I decided to go with the Garlic Cream Fettucinne with added chicken and was very pleased with the dish.  The garlic flavor was very nice and the chicken was just enough to add another layer to the overall taste of the dish.  The fettuccine itself was 10.99 but the chicken was an additional 2.75 so the pricing could be better but it was decent enough for the portion I received.  I topped off my dish with some parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes.  I would definitely recommend this dish and will for sure order this again on a future visit.  My wife had to sample to pasta herself after saying how good it looked and she too approved. Overall we had a pleasant experience here for dinner which I was worried about after reading several reviews regarding terrible service but luckily we experienced none of these issues.  I am sure we will be back soon as they offer a large and varied menu with several other dishes catching my eye as well.  Until next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=60,3.6,3.38,3.38,3.088,3.4680000000000004

I also enjoy their pear salad pizza, there is no cheese and you still have the delicious pizza crust and a fresh salad combined. The pears on the pizza tangy and sweet and make the perfect addition.

We have gone twice recently and have had good experiences both times. My husband is on the pizza dough points club and the first time was able to get a free small plate. (Basically an appetizer) We went with the chicken tinga quesadillas. They were tiny, but good. At least it was free. I had gone with the bbq chicken pizza and loved it. My husband had the garlic cream fettuccini. He added chicken (at 2.79 and not much chicken), but boy was it tasty. Great service, on top of drink refills, friendly, gave you all options, etc. We went back recently. This time his pizza dough points had a $10 off $40 or more. Awesome.  Both times I had the frozen raspberry lemonade. (Yummy). This time for a meal I went with the garlic cream fettuccini but I did not add the chicken. My husband had the tostada pizza and added lime chicken for around 1.79 or so. It looked like a gigantic tostada! Great service again. On top of everything. Appetizers were offered but we declined. Recommendations on yummy food items were made, and dessert was offered. We went with the butter cake and added ice cream. A bit pricey, but they weren't chinsy on the size like most places and desserts. Wow! That was deeeeelicious! Now it might be a must item dang it! TRY IT!!!!

Don't get me wrong they are great people, friendly & aware. But the awareness is what bothers me a tad bit. Just wish they are a bit more attentive and consistent with their customer table service.  My family and friends pretty much ordered the pasta plates whereas I ordered the Ciabatta Club sandwich with salad. What is funny is that all the pasta plates including the kids meal all arrived around the same time from one another. My meal however, the sandwich and salad, arrived 5 minutes later. The easiest meal to make & it arrives last and late.  Observations about the staff. The Greeter, some lady, loves to chit chat in the back with the staff. Rest of the Male Waiters try their best to keep up with the customers and their orders. My waiter was cool but it seems something was on his mind. There was this group who kept raising their hands to place their orders and was later served. So either they know that the Lunchtime crowd is slow or today was just one of those lazy days for the entire staff.  Maybe later this week I'll go their for dinner and see if there is a difference between the two staffs. The food is great and there were no complaints from anyone.

What really made our night was when an employee named Kirby came to our table to see how everything was. We saw her throughout the night doing this with other tables. We thought she was the manager & thought this was excellent customer service. Anyway, she asked if we were celebrating anything & we told her it was an early Valentine's date for us. We also mentioned that we recently got married in December & never had a honeymoon so this was our chance to have a little time to ourselves without the kids. Kirby had a very bubbly personality & was just very sweet. She left our table & came back a little while later with a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our recent marriage! In addition to that, she also gave us a voucher that was good for a free appetizer on our next visit. I was simply blown away by her service! We always have a great experience at this particular location but this was above & beyond anything I have ever experienced anywhere! Kirby is truly an amazing asset to the company!

For appetizers, we ordered the quesadillas, arugula salad and ""2 in a bowl"" split pea and chicken tortilla soup. We highly recommend them all. Turning to our main dishes, the White Pizza with four cheeses and Applewood Bacon was unbelievably delicious. Their bacon has the best texture and flavor that we've ever had.  We also ordered their signature Chicken Tequila Fettuccine which is surprisingly light and tangy. The Tostada thin crust pizza was scrumptious and the Grilled Chicken Chimichurri on their lite menu was very flavorful with the vegetables cooked just right so they were still a little crunchy.

Since it was take away, the 'breading/pizza' part came in a pizza box while the salad and vinaigrette came in a separate container. The description on the website indicated the pizza crust would be a parmisean crust...I've made one myself before but only used actual parmisean...melted it down and formed a crust like form (thin and crunchy). This pizza however used a very, very, very hard to chew bread with parmisean crumbles on top. I'm not one to complain about bread being chewy...I take home blue bayou bread and eat for 3 days...stale and chewy bread is ok with me but this crust was hard to even tear into smaller pieces in order to crumble on top of the salad. I only ate 1 (ONE!) Slice of the pizza bread and half of it I had to tear up in order to try to enjoy it on top of the salad. My effort was futile because the fork they provided wouldn't penetrate the bread anyway!  Salad was good...seemed 1-2 day old greens. The vinaigrette was ok but they could probably do much better if the tried. If I decide to get a salad again here, I will just ask for a side of red wine vinegar instead. Don't get me wrong...I ate the salad but it was a small amount of greens compared to the size of the crust and I had wished I ordered a plain old salad in the end cause I threw out the remaining crust.

After that, our server seemed to mentally and physically check out of serving. When he first brought our drinks, he was missing one straw, and said he'd bring one right over. It took him FIFTEEN minutes to come back with ONE straw. Then we asked for a water for the little one, and another straw (since one had dropped on the floor), and that took another ten minutes. Then he brought our food, and we had to ask for a second plate, since we were sharing a dish, and ranch. Mind you, we had asked for this second plate when we placed the order, since we were sharing. He came back about 7 minutes later with JUST THE RANCH. We asked for a plate AGAIN, and he brought it back in a few minutes. The chicken in the kids plate we ordered was stringy and gristly, and we wanted to let the server know, but he NEVER came back to check on us. As the other part of my party went to the restroom, twice with the little one, the server was spotted standing at the end of the bar, counting his money and chatting with a fellow employee. As I went to the restroom, I saw the same thing. So three times he was spotted in the same place, NOT checking on us. So as we are sitting there, not able to ask a question, or replace our food, we then saw our server standing near the kitchen with his SUNGLASSES on and keys in hand. Mind you, he's facing us, and still not fazed that he hasn't checked on us, or even brought us the check or anything. About 5 minutes later, we watched him walk out of the restaurant. I then had to get up to ask someone to see a manager to find out what is happening with us, the server followed me to the table and asked if she could get us anything (I'm then picking up the fact that we were her problem now, and she realized she hasn't checked on us either.) A few minutes after that, the manager then came by and asked how we were, and we then told him all that was wrong. He himself had a bit of an attitude about it, but said he understood and will talk to them, and doesn't condone the behavior. He took care of the child's meal, and offered to box the rest of our pizza, but at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant. As someone who's worked in the restaurant industry before, this is terrible customer service, and unacceptable if you ask me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=80,2.8,3.36,3.36,2.404,3.136

We went and it was busy, it was like 7:30 dinner rush, so yes this might be bad and I don't typically put places on blast but I had a bad time here so now for the main story. We walk in and see someone we know working they suggest the bar so we check it out and see its full except for the end, but we see a table and ask is it cool if we take this unused table and they say no. Then two girls walked up a minute after to the same waitress and they said that it was completely fine. As we Awkwardly sat split on the handicapped bar set up and one at average bar height seat so I'm kinda miffed about that but then that lady took those ladies orders and slipped us, and instead of telling the bartenders to remember us we sat there for ten minutes before someone got us drinks and the ladies got food. Then the server got to us ten minutes after that. Meanwhile we held menus in the air to be served. Honestly disappointed greatly with service, but like I said results may vary.  The salads took around 17 mins with another wait for our silverware. We could have eaten faster if we waited for a table.

26,Andrew O.,"Tustin, CA",185,69,18.0,2.0,2016-11-02,"Located in Anaheim's GardenWalk, California Pizza Kitchen (hereafter referred to CPK) is a beautiful interior in a fine location, heck, it's located next to the happiest place on earth, how could it not be a sweet spot?  Although they make their pizzas by hand (and you can see chef's tossing pizza dough behind the counter), there are very few modifications that can be made to any of the items on the menu because most of the food is pre-made. So right away, if you're particular about your food or want to pay for freshly created food, this is not the spot for you.  The food itself was okay just like any CPK. For the money you're paying, though, I'd expect the quality to be better. It's like Applebee quality food with Outback Steakhouse prices.  We had a party of five, we all ordered cocktails, beer, and speciality drinks, we ordered two appetizers, and an entree apiece, and yet our waiter tried to upsell us with EVERY. SINGLE. SENTENCE. Look I'm not against the upsell, I get it, but it was just this intense back and forth. For example: Me ""I'll get the lettuce wraps"" Waiter, ""Would you like chicken and shrimp on that? Chicken and shrimp are my personal favorite.""  Me ""Sure, we'll get chicken and shrimp. And we'll have the BBQ chicken pizza."" Waiter, ""Ok, would you like bacon and pineapple on that? Those are my personal favorite I'm a huge fan."" And everything we ordered was like that. It's like, calm down bud, we're already ordering appetizers and drinks (two rounds) and whatnot, you don't have to go so hard. We aren't being chincy and ordering water for the table. I can only assume this is management's directive which is why I'm not singling out our waiter by name but check yourself CPK, when people come to spend money they want to be treated with respect, not like cheap human beings whom you have to hard sell for every additional dollar. Heck, three of our five person party showed up a few minutes before the rest and we paused at the front door to see if the other two had arrived and a hostess had sprung out of the restaurant asking us if we had any questions about the menu -- calm down now, we're already eating at you establishment, no need to reel us in.

Me and my sister shared a Bolognese using Fusili pasta with added mushrooms. It was our favorite dish growing up because of the meaty sauce with cheese. For years we would go every week or so with our family and order that exact dish off of the kids menu. (You would think we would've thought to try the pizza first.)  We were excited to order it again after such a long time, but the dish we got was a disappointing shadow of the one we remembered. There was barely any meat in the sauce, and even less cheese. The only thing done right was the pasta itself--cooked al dente. Well done, California Pizza Kitchen, well done... My sister thought it was her cold preventing her from tasting much flavor, but after trying some salt she confirmed it was just the blandness of the Bolognese. She felt like she could've made the dish she had gotten at home. Knowing her, I knew she could've made something better.

Anyways, we all sat outside, when it was time to leave and we all had given our credit cards to pay, the lights went out and the machines were unable to charge us. We had to be elsewhere and they forced us to wait until they were able to figure things out. Almost half an hour later, they tell us that they can manually charge our credit cards by writing the info down by hand, so then we had to wait in a long line just to be charged and during this time, others walked out without paying for their meals. At the end, all we got was a weak apology. To top it off, before all this even happened cpk didn't bring any kind of dessert or anything for my friends birthday even though they were aware of the celebration.

Second, multiple individuals in the party were charged incorrect amounts, and when calling to inquire about the charges, myself included, were treated as inferior and not with respect.

31,Kelli H.,"Manitou Springs, CO",0,2,,4.0,2017-02-13,"I ordered a to-go a few days ago and when I got back to work I noticed that the salad I bought didn't have anything on it. (Pretty sure the kid that bagged up my order was new, it happens). I called them to let them know I was going to come back and was placed on hold so she could grab someone to help me. I got in my car to drive back and was left on hold the entire time. As I walked up to the counter a guy answered and told me sorry for the wait (30 minutes into it!). I was beyond irritated by this point so I asked for a manager.  The man I spoke to was polite, listen to my complaint and was quick to fix the issue. He explained that the toppings are boxed separately (warm chicken and veggies) and grabbed the two containers that had been left. He asked me if I would like the whole thing redone and guaranteed me that they would figure out what happened for the hold time. He then refunded my ticket. Not one time did he offer an excuse or try to defend what happened. Just heard my complaint, apologized and fixed it.  Driving there I was ready to leave an aweful review (messed up order, 30 minute hold time and a 20 minute drive back so they could fix it). But the professionalism of the manager changed my experience. I've worked in restaurants before and I know mistakes happen it's what's done after that can make it or break it, they did well.  I had never ate there before. Once my salad had all the pieces it was fantastic! I will definitely try it again. Great job changing a cappy situation into something positive!

The wait at CPK was only 50 mins so we decided to stay because we were starving.  The wait wasn't too bad and the greeter was really nice.  After we were seated the first thing I noticed is that CPK has really moved away from highlighting their pizzas on the menu. I was a little disappointed as I've been a fan of their pizzas since 1990. There was a ton of other stuff on the menu that I didn't even know they served like steak, fish, and pasta.  The food took a while to get to the table and the waiter didn't really check in with us but hey, I get it, it was packed and it was really busy.  We ordered the plank Salmon, a pasta dish, arugula salad and a kids pizza. The sizes were a little small and the taste was kinda average. Not bad, but just average. Now the key is that if you are going to serve smaller dishes then the taste needs to be BIG. and they just didn't accomplish that.

It's been a while since I've visited a CPK. I ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza to get a refresher of how great it tasted.

Dirty Plates and etc. No silverware and napkins. 2. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Undercooked pasta and burnt. 3. Pizza Dough Rewards Processing the rewards is as slow as molasses. Ordered: 1/2 Waldorf Chicken Salad Chicken Tequila Fettuccine 1/2 Thai Crunch Salad Gluten-Free Crust Roasted Garlic Chicken Having been to the GardenWalk multiple times over the years, I've been to Cheesecake Factory, Bubba Gump, and now CPK. The GardenWalk is conveniently located nearby to the Convention Center and the nearby hotels so there are often lots of tourists around so some restaurants can get pretty packed. Having known that, we decided to try the ""Call Ahead"" feature where one can call up to 1-hr ahead prior to arriving at the restaurant and get priority seating.  We called ahead and arrived within 30 minutes of the time we stated and did have priority seating. There were a few groups waiting here and there but also lots of empty tables. It seems that they were short servers, thus half the restaurant was empty.  The plates initial plates on the tables still had food encrusted on them and I had to ask Franky, our server, to switch one of the plates out. We were sat at a table of 4 for the 2 of us but it worked out because our 2 other friends were able to join us for dinner prior to the concert at HOB.  Granted, I haven't had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine in years but I do not remember it being this poorly cooked. I had the hardest time trying to figure out why my pasta wasn't al dente but there were burnt marks also. So they undercooked the pasta and then tossed it with the sauce but let it sit on the burner too long and burned the bottom. There were lots of ingredients but the noodles themselves were quite disappointing and that is what makes the dish a pasta.  We didn't have enough time to head to a coffee shop nearby and decided to order coffee here, there was something black inside of my creamer container. I am guessing it is a pepper or something but what is it doing in the container?  When our other 2 friends joined us for dinner, no utensils/napkins or even bread were brought over for them. The two of us had already finished our bread and was starting our main dishes so there obviously was not bread for them. I had to go ask for menus from the hostesses and also grab utensils for them when their food was brought after they ordered.  When we were paying for our bill, it took a very long time. I had mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I had a dough reward and Franky mentioned I could provide my phone number or email address at the end of the meal. A bit of a tedious process as I had to write it on the check and then have him re-run and then have the manager apply the dough rewards. It took over 10 minutes having the manager apply the rewards. We were running a bit later than we had expected and hoped to pay and head over to HOB but this was the part that took the longest. Even my friends who had only 1 card for one check, took them the same amount of time. It seems that the servers do not clear the check and that the manger does it. I am also guessing only 1 credit card machine. For a restaurant located on the GardenWalk, I expected more efficiency as they must have high volume of customers during busy times.   They do validate for 1 hour and can be validated by the server when paying for your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2,3.44,3.17,3.3,,3.278

While the pizza is good, it's of course going to have a different taste than most pizzeria slices. A personal pie is probably the equivalent of 2 regular pizzeria slices for a size comparison. The one thing I wasn't exactly a fan of was the prices, which were high with what you were getting. A kid's pie and 1 personal pie was over $20 - but I had no real complaints, since it was a filling option with minimal wait. The pizza always tasted great.

I am literally wearing my NorthFace jacket with my hood on and it seems like no one bothered to notice. When I was leaving I also noticed a little kid doing the same thing as I was with the hood on. I even told a server that it is freezing in here and her response to me was ""it's always cold in here."" Can I just say WOW.

5,Jenn K.,"Cerritos, CA",78,246,66.0,4.0,2017-10-26,"This place and location are great since theres hardly a wait unless you come with a group of 10. My favorite dishes here are the Bbq chicken chopped salad, Santa Fe Pizza, Garlic Fettuccine Alfredo. We came here the other day for a special event ""Chef Challenge"" and we got to sample a mushroom noodle dish and it was so good!! I was surprised since i don't really mix it up that much once i find my favorite dishes. After being seated a waiter will shortly be with you to offer complimentary house bread with a oil infused herb dipping sauce. They have Pepsi products here so sorry guys No Coke!! They also offer Alcoholic drinks as well, i feel every time i come back they have a new season beverage. My favorite dessert is the Dark Chocolate Molten Lava cake!! guys its seriously the perfect combination of sweet but not too sweet and decadent!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2,3.6,3.21,3.308,,3.366
18,Jenny S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,30,25.0,3.0,2017-10-27,Food was great and our waiter did a nice job handling a large group. Our biggest challenge was being seated.  We entered for an early dinner...just a few occupied tables and the hostess said it would take 20 minutes to seat us?!?  We sat and watched multiple parties being seated ahead of us.  We ended up having a great outdoor spot for everyone but I'm still not sure why it took so long to seat our group when there were plenty of table options to place together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2,3.52,3.2,3.304,,3.3280000000000007

8,Valley G.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,188,95.0,5.0,2017-11-11,Hands down THE BEST CPK I have ever been to. I wish they were closer to my house! After a long day at Disneyland we wanted to get out of the park and eat close by. We saw CPK was close and hopped in the car. (About 7 mins from Disneyland). I have to make a notable mention to Tommy the manager here who saw we were with hungry kids and made sure we got our food very quickly. He went ABOvE and BeyOND to take care of us. CPK is mt favorite chain restaurant and the food is always good. But it was Tommy who took the experience to another level by the exceptional customer service he provided us. It was unforgettable. I hope this location's area management recognizes his value to the team.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2,3.68,3.19,3.312,,3.386
1,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051.0,3.0,2017-11-15,"I mean, it's a CPK. You know what you're in for when you step in. You should, at least. My friend and I were in Anaheim for the weekend, up to celebrate our birthdays the only way we know how: a weekend full of Disney geekiness. We drove up midday on Friday, checked in to our hotel, hopped over to a spa for a facial and massage, and as we were driving back to our hotel, we both realized that we hadn't eaten anything all day. It was almost 7 pm by then. We were starving, and CPK was the only restaurant that had no wait at that time. We got a table on the patio because though it was 7 pm in October, it was still hot as balls. Our waitress was sweet, but golly, she took her time getting to us. Never a good thing when you're famished, you know? Once we were able to place our orders, we got the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower to share. I went with the Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti and my friend got the Banh Mi Bowl. We of course also ordered cocktails, because vacation. The food took forever to get to us, but at least we had bread to gnaw on. When we did get fed (and had our second round of cocktails - we each got the sangria flight), the food was okay. I think I liked mine a lot more than my friend liked hers, which is unfortunate because she was the one most feeling the need for food. She had to ask for extra dressing for her bowl because she said everything was so dry. She didn't seem to like the flavors of the meal, either. My pasta dish was okay. It was saucy but not very flavorful. I powered through the dish in record time, then sat there feeling like a pig and wondering if I was satiated. Side note - there was an altercation on the street outside of CPK while we were sitting there. The police were called, and at one point, the CPK manager came out to check on us. It was nice of them to be concerned, at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2,3.76,3.18,3.308,,3.4120000000000004
290,Alyssa S.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-24,"This has got to be the worst service i've ever received! Usually the staff is very well with handling the late lunch hour. I got there about 1:50pm and there weren't a whole lot of people in the place. It took about 20 minutes to be seated and didn't even bring my drinks out until I asked the waiter to bring them out. Let alone, I had to wait another 10 minutes to order. By that time it was about 2:35. Around 3:00 o'clock I asked about my food and told me it should be coming out shortly. It didn't..by the time I got my food it was half cold and untouchable.
