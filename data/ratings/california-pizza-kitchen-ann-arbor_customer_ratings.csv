While I think the restaurant is a bit pricey, the food is excellent.  The Thai chicken pizza is a favorite of mine (and my 12-yr old daughter).  The kung pao spaghetti is also great.  They are so good, in fact, that I always end up ordering one of those, even though there are a lot of things on the menu that sound good. Everyone in my family loves this place, right down to my 5-year old.  I can't remember ever having a bad experience here, and we've been going for years (very sparingly, mind you - usually just to use the bday coupons the kids get).

A little goes a long way but the spice level is perfectly tingly without overwhelming everything if you go light on the application of it. My husband went for the BBQ chicken pizza, no onion, with bacon. Happily balanced.  As we had a five dollar off coupon, we splurged on a piece of lemon cake. Six layers of spongy cake and lemon custard frosted in a marscapone based frosting with some lemon sugar sprinkled on the top. Not too sweet but perfect and a great share. Iced tea is brewed in house and is really stellar, that always matters to me. No need for a lemon wedge even. Yep it's a chain but consistent. Spendy but pretty damn good. Reliable food at the mall is fairly priceless.

I liked that they separated all the ingredients so that it wasn't soggy by the time we got home. The chicken was dry and the pizza lacked flavor over all.

I called the store and the manager, Sarah, was more than pleasant in handling the situation. I stopped back in only expecting my money refunded from the overcharge, but she went above and beyond my expectations, all while apologizing to the degree that I felt bad for complaining. She was great. Every time I have eaten at or gotten carry-out from CPK, I have been pleased. I have never had a bad server, host, or bartender.

Not yesterday.  Our pizza was rubbery and burned.  It had literally two to three small cherry tomatoes totally lost in the vastness of the rubbery dough.  The large Caesar salad had at most one teaspoon of salad dressing and four croutons.  We waited to be seated for quite a while, not because they were full but because the person in charge of sitting people was God only knows where. When the pizza came out, the same person that seated us came with a pizza that I could tell was ours, offered it to the table next to us, and then departed  with the pizza for the kitchen returning 2 minutes later with the same pizza and finally gave it to us.

42,Jason M.,"Alexandria, VA",67,328,74.0,3.0,2013-11-17,"This is a very safe go-to for a bite out, but far from trendy or gourmet. Granted, I haven't been to CPK since they renovated their menu a couple years ago. I can safely say that change was for the worse, as really all they did was take away 50% of the menu. The items left were largely changed as well. A great example was my favorite - Garlic Chicken Pizza. They don't even use the garlic pesto sauce on it anymore. While the chicken appears better (it's shredded instead of cubed), it's also very dry as it's on the very top and theres no cheese or anything to attempt to lock in any moisture. It's notably less garlicy, and while definitely edible and average, it's not as good as it used to be. My wife's Waldorf salad may have been the better option, though she and I both observed a lot of lettuce and not enough of the fixins - grapes and nuts. It was also absolutely drenched in dressing, to the point that you couldn't see through the bottom of the bowl at the end. I'm also not sure if it was just the location, but it was incredibly loud all around us. I've also never seen so many children at a CPK before. I'll give a shout out to the service which was really great, though I had no idea who our actual waitress was since we had 3 people who spent equal time at our table serving us. For a budget date night this isn't bad, but it's really nothing to go out of your way for anymore.

It was pretty noisey, but that was fine by me because when you have a toddler, the noiser the better! We ordered a ""supreme"" type pizza and a Margherita pizza, and they both were pretty good. One pizza is enough for two people, but you could kill a whole pie if you were really hungry (which we were!)

We told the bartender and he was very apologetic and was happy to serve us. After getting beers, we noticed there were gnats all over the place... This was bizarre because it was winter outside, yet gnats were thriving in this place. My girlfriend and I decided on a salad and pizza but for some reason the bartender said that we should get his favorite salad, so we changed it to his recommendation. It was a bad decision because the salad wasn't all that good.. It turned out to be a very simple salad consisting of lettuce and arugula with a light olive oil vinaigrette. We wondered why the bartender would suggest we change out order! Very weird.. The Pizza turned out to be just OK. Gave 2/5 because the bartender was nice and had good intentions.

The food came out fast and the waitress refilled our drinks as needed. The atmosphere is nice and seems more family orientated than other restaurants in the mall. The food is below average. Everything tastes like it came out of a freezer. The ingredients taste bland and not very fresh. For my appetizer I had the avacado eggrolls. They were too salty and I was disappointed that I paid $10 for them. A $4 guacamole and chips small plate only came with 10 chips and a small scoop of guacamole. It tasted decent but was barely enough for one person. I had the original bbq pizza and I rather eat a frozen pizza at home. Bottom line I think this restaurant has low quality food for the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-ann-arbor?start=20,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

Particular favorites - the flatbread (mushroom and spinach!), and the garlic cream pasta. I have pretty high standards when it comes to pasta, especially cream sauces, and I wouldn't have expected such a good sauce from this place. It's rich but not too rich, creamy, with just the right amount of Parmesan and a delightful hint of garlic. I get it with mushrooms and chicken, and it is easily one of my favorite meals ever.

Well, of course it was discontinued a long time ago. I decided to give the jerk chicken pizza a go. The description mentioned hot and sweet, and though I really don't like any sweet in my Jamaican food, I took a chance that it might be balanced and I might not mind. The pizza looked amazing, nicely put together and cooked just right. I tore in and was immediately taken back by the sweetness. I thought I had a bad slice so I pressed on. After two slices I had to stop, because it was so sickeningly sweet. I swear they used concentrated jelly instead of sauce. Here I was hoping for the true scotch bonnet and allspice experience, and was delivered a dessert pizza instead. I ended up taking the rest home and I think my wife had a slice, but I couldn't go back to it. I would have given three stars, but my kid didn't like her cheese pizza very much and my wife wasn't impressed with her mushroom pizza either, Being that it cost the three of us around 50 bucks for that lunch, the top notch service we received wasn't enough to sway me higher.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-ann-arbor,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

We decided to go with the original BBQ chicken salad to start, followed by the Thai chicken pizza.  I was kinda underwhelmed by both. The salad came out and the dressing on it was a little heavy. The BBQ chicken left a lot to be desired as they were merely little chunks of what seemed like leftover chicken. And for an additional $1.25, I would have expected a decent amount of avocado but it was less than about a quarter of one.  The Thai pizza was pretty good - thin, crispy crust but the toppings were heavily on one side of the pizza only. It was kinda ""meh"", same as the salad - the chicken was just little tiny chunks and spotty.

My boyfriend decided to get their new spicy buffalo cauliflower and my mom and I split the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza. I really like the pizza; it's sweet yet savory and as a bonus is comes with practically a salad on top of it. Although the spicy buffalo cauliflower tasted pretty good, I could not believe my eyes with how little you get for $7. It was seriously 1/4 head of cauliflower on the plate. Pizza should be more like $10, rather than $13; it's not exactly gourmet. After getting the check I started to notice the abundance of fruit flies surrounding our table.

The lunch special is a really good deal though -- you get a lot of food for only $10. I generally get the personal BBQ pizza with the tortilla soup, which is a delicious and very filling combo, and I would definitely recommend it. The pizza is lighter and healthier than the regular heavy and greasy pizza prevalent throughout the midwest (v nice because you don't feel like your waistline just expanded by 10 inches from ingesting your meal).

Typically the service has been good or very good, but not this time.  Timothy Y. had the nerve to correct my Dad's pronounciation of the Banh Mi bowl, brought me the most sickeningly sweet iced tea drink when I had specifically asked for unsweetened tea, and had to be nudged by one of the other waitstaff to come to our table after I had unsuccessfully flagged him for a couple of minutes.  The topper, he asked if I wanted change from the cash I had provided to pay our bill.  The restaurant wasn't busy; however, we did visit over the Independence Day holiday, so maybe some of the typical wait staff were away. The prices are high for what is served; however, the portions seem to have also increased.  The menu seems to offer more fried food, but I'm glad they have kept the Chinese Chicken Salad on the menu, with an option for a half order.  I also like that they provide total calories of every food option, for those of us who are tracking, and wanting to make healthier choices while dining out. There are far too many better options in Ann Arbor to want to visit CPK again.  Overall, not a good value for the dollar, and the service this last time was the final straw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-ann-arbor,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

I took everyone who visited me there for dinner. Looking back it's pretty funny given how many delicious non-chain eateries there are in Chicago but at 18, new to the city, and pre-Yelp I didn't have a very good handle on these things.  These days I don't always seek out CPK but when I do I don't mind it. I'm a big fan of what I call ""the mall date"" (it's exactly as it sounds) and often that entails a bite at CPK or PF Chang's as part of it. This particular location at Briarwood is a good one compared to the rest of the locations in the chain. It's clean, food is prepared as expected (and relatively tasty), service is fine, and it's usually pretty easy to find a table. The menu itself is varied and it's easy to find something for meat eaters, vegetarians, and picky kids too (making it very family friendly). The lunch menu is also pretty nice in that you can combine pizza, salads or soups in any combination for a nice variety. I recently had the baked potato soup and the pepperoni pizza and it was the perfect cozy lunch on a cold fall day.  It's not my go-to choice in town but if I'm in the mall it's definitely one of the places I'll make a beeline towards for a reliably tasty meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-ann-arbor,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
1,Nick R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",63,70,117.0,3.0,2018-01-02,"I have fond memories of CPK from my childhood. It was a staple of the mall, and it often was the one redeeming feature of those arduous back to school shopping trips with my mother. I loved everything about it: the unique flavors, the quick service, even people watching the patrons of the mall.  Sadly, whether it's growing into adulthood, or an actual decline in quality, the experience at CPK Briarwood did not live up to my youthful fantasy. To be clear, the food did; the overall experience did not.  The service was rushed and uninterested. The menu seemed reduced. The prices are higher. Perhaps that's the way of the world, and since my memories are over fifteen years old, I suppose restaurants are liable to change. However, I think that the most telling change was a new section on their menu titled ""small plates."" It would seem that CPK is trying to break into the tapas trend a bit late. Here's the caveat with tapas: if you're going to charge full price for tiny plates, it has to be damn good. It wasn't. The tapas were just minimalist appetizers at full price. This is not what you want to see at a chain restaurant. To summarize: it's California Pizza Kitchen. If you want good, unique pizza flavors, it's still the place to go. Our pizza was great.
