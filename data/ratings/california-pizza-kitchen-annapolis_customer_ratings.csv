We walked in four minutes before they closed (on a Sunday) and were promptly seated without hesitation. We ordered drinks (which weren't very strong, but tasty nonetheless),  appetizers, and the pear and gorgonzola pizza on whole wheat crust. Our appetizers were served without silverware and we had to flag down a waitress to retrieve them. We felt  a tiny bit rushed when we were served our pizza before we even finished our appetizers. However, the pizza was excellent, our bill was reasonable for two courses and drinks, and we were served even after closing time.

There was a lot of very obvious trash and food underneath the table that I was initially sat it which could have been removed prior to seating me. When I asked to be seated outside, the silverware was dirty, so I had to ask for a cup of hot water to try to sanitize everything. I guess you can't expect much on that area from chain restaurants or even non-chains nowadays. On the flip side, I love and highly recommend their flat crust margherita pizza with wheat whole grain crust and pepperoni, so much so that I can ignore the unsightliness of the place. Waitress I had was OK, she was busy with other tables and didn't really pay attention to us, so if it wasn't for the pizza tasting so darn good, I would probably give this place a two star review. I've gone to the one in Tyson's mall in VA and had the same issue of great food, bad presentation.

Ended up deciding on the JAMBALAYA FETTUCCINE and  MARGHERITA PIZZA WITH SAUSAGE. My coworker raves about their Margherita which was quite delectable with a perfectly crispy thin crust and the classic combo of cheesy, tomatoey, basil-y melted goodness. With the heartiness of the sausage it almost kept me from ordering off the small plates menu...almost. I did try the FRIED MACARONI BITES, which is nothing special. Save yourself the trouble, I will say it was nicely fried with the crunchy panko crust though.  My hubbie's fettuccine was perfectly al dente. Be prepared! It it a huge plate.

I like the jambalaya pasta even though I don't eat sausage or ham so I spend most of the time picking it out. A little nutty... Try not to judge.  The pizza is pretty good. I particularly like the whole grain crust and even though I order a plain cheese pizza, it's still pretty good. I've tried the white pizza but I'm not a fan.  As for desserts, I like the butter cake.

The appetizer and dessert were good, but the entrees left much to be desired. The bolognese pasta was especially bland and the sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can (not fresh).

I ordered more than a few items to sample so don't judge me. I began with the chips/guacamole and avocado eggrolls. The guacamole was good and had a little kick to it. At $4 don't expect a very filling snack which leads into the avocado eggrolls. The eggrolls also contained chicken and some bacon and the bacon was a dominant flavor that was tasted. Both apps were good and satisfying. I ordered the Italian sandwhich that came with split pea soup. The soup was very surprising as I never tried split pea soup before and now I am wondering what have I been missing all these years. CPK you make me look back at some life decisions I have made. The Italian came on a ciabatta bun that was very soft and this was a pleasant surprise as many places seem to have very hard ciabatta bread for their sandwiches.

91,Kevin B.,"California, MD",2,15,2.0,2.0,2015-08-10,"As long long time patron of California Pizza Kitchen of over 20 years at various locations around the country I've come to have certain expectations of the quality of food and service.  I typically experience average service and slightly above average food quality.  However my last 2 experiences, both of which were at this location (coincidentally I assume), were disappointing.   I typically avoid ordering appetizers and such at most restaurants but decided the Crispy Mac n' Cheese seemed interesting.  It was a major disappointment.  I found the 4 tiny little deep fried medallions (I dont recall the menu saying deep fried though it does so online) underwhelming and disgustingly greasy on the outside.  The macaronis were slightly overcooked and the cheddar cheese of low quality.  The cheese sauce was about as appetizing as cheese whiz. For the meal itself we split a Caesar salad and Spinach and Artichoke Thin Crust pizza.  I tried the pizza first and was disappointed from the first bite.  The crust was paper thin, much thinner than any thin crust pizza I've ever had any where.  The overall flavor of the pizza was, well pretty much in a word, gross.  Unfortunately my disappointment didn't end there. The Caesar salad left much to be desired thanks to the dressing. The dressing was very watery and dominated by vinegar (I assume) or lemon juice if actually made from scratch.  The positive about the salad is that the lettuce was fresh and crispy.    In defense of this location I place the blame neither on the location staff nor the management. As always our waitress was friendly, prompt and appropriately attentive.  The food appeared at our table in quick order.  If not for that this visit would have rated 1 star.  I place the majority of the fault with the recipes and prepared items emanating from the corporate CPK chefs.  I think its too bad, though understandable, that Yelp provides for reviews of only individual locations and not the chains themselves visible regardless of their members locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.208,3.2000000000000006

49,Elle H.,"Crofton, MD",101,117,1203.0,4.0,2015-11-28,"My mom, neighbor, and I ate here last week. It was on a weekday, a little after 4pm. We asked for a table and we were taken to a booth. I have to mention that the past 4-5 times I've come here, every time I ask for a table I've been taken to a booth. It's not a huge deal, but there IS a difference between the two. When you're out with friends and each friend has a couple of shopping bags the booth gets a bit cramped for my liking. You're able to spread out more at the tables. When we ask for a table again, we're almost always met with a slight eye roll or sigh, even though there is never anyone in the table sections to the left. I don't get it.  Again - it's not a big deal, but I guess the next time we go we'll have to be super specific and say we don't want a booth.  Anyway - we were seated at a table promptly. Our sever comes over, introduces herself, and takes our drink order. She was very polite and friendly, but always seemed to be in a rush. The restaurant wasn't crowded - maybe 3 booths and 2 tables taken up, so we didn't understand what the hurry was. We start to order our appetizer but she walks away without hearing us. She comes back with our drinks and we order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls appetizer (hand-wrapped crispy wontons stuffed with chicken, avocado, tomato, cheese, and bacon, which comes with a ranchito dipping sauced and an herb ranch dipping sauce).  In the middle of ordering the appetizer, the chef comes out to talk to the woman at the table next to us and our server at the same time, thus interrupting our order mid-talk. There was no ""excuse me"" or any acknowledgment from him - he just started talking over us. We waited until their conversation ended and ordered the appetizer again. My neighbor and mom order the half size Chinese Chicken salad (napa, red cabbed, lettuce, chicken, wontons tossed with scallions, cilantro, sesame seeds and hoisin ginger vinaigrette). I order a half Classic Caesar salad (with shaved parmesan cheese and garlic butter croutons) and the Pesto Cream Penne with chicken (basil peso cream sauce, sun dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese).  A couple of minutes after we ordered, our server gives us warm bread and olive oil. The bread was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and the olive oil dip was fresh and yummy. My caesar salad comes about 5 minutes later. I thought it was strange that my salad came out before the appetizer, but I dug in anyway. The salad was fresh and tasted great, but I wish it had more dressing. After another 10-15 wait, two salads and my pasta hit the table. We asked our server about the appetizer and she looked like a deer in headlights. She asked if we ordered one. We told her yes, we did order it. She apologized and asked if we still wanted it. We told her yes, and she said she would put the order in right away. The appetizer came out shortly after. It wasn't that long of a wait. The egg rolls were delicious. It's one of our favorite items on the menu. The dipping sauces compliment the egg rolls well. My mom and my neighbor enjoyed their salads. I would suggest ordering a half size. The portions are huge! My pesto cream penne was delicious. There was plenty of chicken and sun dried tomatoes. There was a lot of sauce but the pasta wasn't drowning in it, which I like. Our server was very nice, but was a bit scatterbrained. If the restaurant isn't crowded, there's no reason to be in such a rush. She did check in with us to see how our meals were and gave us refills on water twice. We waited for her for several minutes to pick up the signed check and her tip but she was standing in the back chatting with two co-workers and didn't look over. We left with it on the table. Overall, we had an okay experience. We had no complaints about the food. The food is always consistent at this restaurant.

I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone that wants a great dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=20,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88

14,B. S.,"Annapolis, MD",8,44,5.0,4.0,2017-05-09,"A friend and I met here today for lunch. They were pretty busy which is a good sign. The restaurant appeared to be clean and the server was quick to show up. Our appetizer came out in about 15 to 20 minutes which felt kind of long but I was really hungry. The appetizer was really good. We both ordered the salad and pizza combination for lunch which a nice price for the amount of food you get. The food was good but not amazing.  Overall, I'd go back: good service, good prices, clean restrooms and they have a rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.96,3.96,3.96,,3.96
7,Steve E.,"Laurel, MD",56,85,87.0,4.0,2017-05-21,"Arrived and was seated quickly despite it being moderately busy. Place is nice and clean. Service was good. My only complain is that water is not brought out you must ask for it. And the napkins are paper not cloth. They do provide complimentary bread (not warm) with a olive oil and spice mix (not the best) I have been to CPK before but at an Airport location. I have tried the famous ""BBQ Chicken Pizza"" which is you must order if you never been here. Since this was my first time at this location I chose to be adventurous and try something different. Drink:  CUCUMBER REVIVER (delicious and refreshing) will order again Appetizer: CHARRED SHISHITO PEPPERS ( mild spicy and goes good with the tosatada pizza)..its ok will try something different next time Main course:  TOSTADA Pizza, (healthy and good but not impressed by the presentation) stick to the BBQ chicken pizza next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.96,3.96,3.96,,3.96

9,Jason S.,"Leesburg, VA",1,5,4.0,4.0,2017-06-17,The Annapolis location was very good! Great food and  service. Minimal wait on a Saturday evening around 6 the day before Father's Day I got the garlic fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Cream sauce was just right! Not to heavy and very delicious!!

12,Lil Birdie N.,"Severn, MD",10,170,563.0,4.0,2017-07-31,Food here is pretty decent. Too bad they don't have many locations in the area.

16,John D.,"Annapolis, MD",213,7,1.0,2.0,2017-08-12,"I used to come here when I worked in the mall back in high school. That was 1995-1996. Service was horrible back then. I now have two kids - now 7 and 8, and sadly for me, I have to keep coming back and realizing that the service is still just as bad. It's almost as if it is run by a bunch of lazy teenagers who have no understanding of what it's like to run a real customer service operation. Decent food, especially for a mall...but just absolutely shocked their service is so amazingly horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84
3,Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,191,220.0,5.0,2017-09-01,"Very fresh and delicious pizza! I ordered the Five Cheese and Fresh Tomato. It has mozzarella, Monterey Jack, smoked Gouda, and Romano cheese with tomato and fresh basil. As I write this, I realized this is only four types of cheese. Not sure what the fifth cheese is or if there even is one but it was delicious. I think it could of used some more basil but it was very good! The service was also great!

Most of the staff was talking to each other, our server was in a one sided conversation less than 10 feet from where we were seated.  We left 15 minutes after we were seated.  The hostess said ""have a great day"" as we walked out.   She didn't know our orders hadn't been taken. When we asked for the manager it ""He's out to lunch"".

19,Miriam M.,"Annapolis, MD",0,16,,2.0,2017-10-22,"Had dinner here last night and was disappointed with the food brought to our table. The roasted vegetable salad was saturated with too much olive oil to be a healthy choice. The spaghetti and sauce were cold . When I finally found  the waitress who was quite busy and had not been checking in with us , she offered to heat up my cold spaghetti. The quality of the food seems to be declining at CPK and my recommendation is to find better alternative at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

10,Julia P.,"Baltimore, MD",147,23,,3.0,2017-11-26,Is CPK going downhill? CPK in Annapolis has always been a reliable lunch spot. We were fairly disappointed with our experience today. The service was inattentive. We were not greeted by our server for about 10 minutes and then she did not check on us after food was delivered and we had a hard time getting her attention to get the check. The salad was fine but not exciting and didn't seem as fresh as usual. Disappointed because I expect more from this restaurant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
2,Emma W.,"Philadelphia, PA",211,112,,2.0,2017-11-26,"Went here for a lunch with friends and it was terrible. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes. We would have ordered drinks, but the server didn't even give us a drink menu or ask if we wanted anything other than water.  I was interested in the full piadina half salad combo available any day and our server had no idea what I was talking about, I had to point it out on the menu.  Our food came promptly and was frankly just not good. The piadina was dry and flavorless, there was no reason to keep the leftovers. As a pizza sandwich, it did not make me want to try their pizza. Everyone enjoyed their salads.  We waited for a while after done eating for the server to come with the check, all of us wondering where she went in the meantime. For the prices and mediocre food, I'd rather eat at the food court next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
8,Daniel M.,"Arundel Mills, MD",147,1,,1.0,2017-12-04,"I hate this place.  The wait staff has no sense of urgency, and it always takes 5-10 minutes before we're even greeted.  We were greeted by a nice young lady who sat us at our table.  And as anticipated we waited for 5 minutes, not even a ""hey i will be right with you.""  So we decided to move to the bar.  We were greeted by the bartender who took our drink and food order.  We ordered salad, soups, and pizza.  Since we're at the bar you can view the kitchen staff work and the pizzas being made.  I watched our bartender prepare our soups, he used his fingers to clean the spoons. Absolutely disgusting.  I don't think I've ever written a review, but this place just disappoints time and time again.  Terrible service and not sanitary.  We will not return or spend any money here in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

Their signature is the BBQ pizza which is so good, but I usually get the California Cobb pizza. My mom always gets the chicken Waldorf salad and wipes the bowl clean. I 10/10 recommend!

1,Art T.,"Crofton, MD",189,383,136.0,4.0,2017-12-27,"I have to preface this by saying we visited on Christmas Eve and with about an hour left until closing.  Still, it was a pretty great experience all things considered. We didn't have to wait at all for a table (beyond the fact that the place was pretty quiet).  The hostess was still attentive and cordial.  The server showed up pretty soon afterwards as well, and she was very attentive to us during our stay.  Refills were rapid and there was no waiting for an empty glass for the suggestion. The appetizer was... okay.  We ordered the Szechuan chicken dumplings, and I really didn't feel like they matched any of those words, save the chicken.  There was no real 'Szechuan' flavor profile, and it was instead a sweet and sticky sauce that batched the plate.  The onions were limp and stringy, and the noodles were overcooked. The pizza, on the other hand, was great.  We had one with whole wheat crust (the garlic chicken) and one with regular (wild mushroom).  Both were fantastic, with fresh and flavorful toppings.  They came out piping hot as well.   Overall, very much worth the visit.  Maybe we'll just skip the appetizer next time.  We could only get through half of each pizza anyway.  One would have been enough for the two of us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

I tend to order a salad and soup when I am there and personally love their fresh tea options. Be sure to check those out!  The Cobb salad comes in a small or large portion and is very good. Sometimes it lacks sufficient dressing. Pizza options are great as well. Overall, very pleased with the menu options, cleanliness, and consistency of this chain.

They ordered a Chef jacket for my son and it really gave the birthday boy a special touch! The food was delicious.
