354,Jessica C.,"Temple City, CA",364,72,37.0,5.0,2012-01-04,"I'm still loving the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad + the butter cake. They changed their menu & it looks much better, IMO. I've become MORE fond of CPK because the last two times, something terrible would happen, but the waiter/waitress always went above and beyond to fix it.  The last time I went, I had a lot of the salad left over & asked for it to be boxed up. I guess the waiter thought I wanted the avocado egg roll (that my friend ordered) to be boxed up. So, he threw away my salad. Right before I was going to leave, I realized my salad was MIA. I asked the waiter and he was so surprised. He immediately told the manage the situation & the manager had a half-salad made for me to go. Amazing. The previous time, I found a small hair in my salad as I was almost done with it. I didn't want to complain because I was already done with the salad and I wasn't sure if it was my hair or not. But my friend told the waitress the situation. The waitress responded with, ""I wish you had told me sooner so I could have brought you a new salad."" I don't know why she would think I wanted to eat a salad that had hair in it. But, she told the manager and he comp'd the full size salad + dessert.  Also, I've searched far & wide for a place that could replicate their BBQ chicken chopped salad and have failed. So, food is A+ & service is A+.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=260,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.22,3.6000000000000005

I like to sit in the patio because my toddler makes a mess and is quite loud. No alcohol is served in the patio fyi. Here are my favorite things to order: bbq chicken salad, sicilian pizza, garlic creamed fetticini, lettuce wrap, and peach italian soda. Here is what i think they need to improve on: the texture of their bread including pizza bread. You have to ask for bread and butter. They don't automatically bring it to you. Their bread is cold and hard. THeir pizza dough isn't crispy enough in my opinion.

133,Tiffany T.,"Arcadia, CA",1096,427,288.0,4.0,2012-01-30,"California Pizza Kitchen has been in the Santa Anita mall ever since I could remember the awkward middle school years when we still had Limited Too and Photobunch. And despite the many years that have passed, one thing that has stayed timelessly good has been Arcadia's CPK.  Personally, my favorite pizzas are the Pepperoni, Mushroom + Sausage and the Wild Mushroom pizza. The pizzas aren't really big, with about 6 smallish-medium slices. I generally find that the size is perfect for sharing. The crust is thin, slightly crispy and sweet, which sets the pizza apart from its other greasier counterparts.  Waldorf Chicken Salad is also delicious! Fresh spinach, arugula, red cabbage, celery, chopped walnuts, apple slices, grapes and grilled chicken gives this salad a unique, fresh twist on your typical salad. It's topped with either blue cheese or balsamic vinegar, making it healthier than a lot of other salads. CPK are geniuses for bringing this sophisticated salad, which originates from New York, into their menu. But I'm not too big on the other dishes. I've had the fish tacos here before but they weren't really memorable. My family happens to like the fettucini, as that is a pretty popular dish among those who don't feeling like having pizza.  The prices aren't unreasonable with pizzas costing around $15, but the dishes will cost more than other pizza joints and you'd get a smaller quantity. But hey, CPK is such a central part of the mall that you can't help wandering in every now and then with a craving for some ""gourmet"" pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=180,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.088,3.6400000000000006

121,Eva I.,"San Gabriel, CA",471,471,3417.0,3.0,2012-06-26,"Ah, what happened to the free bread and butter? After we sat and ordered, I waited and waited. I noticed some tables did get their bread and butter.. Then I wondered maybe it's because they ordered soup or drinks or maybe even paid for it. I wasn't bold enough to ask.. but reading other reviews, it seems like you do have to ask to get the free bread now. (Minus one star.)  The food that we ordered- quinoa salad and pear gorgonzola thin crust. The quinoa salad is a new item on the menu, it was good! My mom and I both liked the pairing of the ingredients and the flavor of it. If you have tried the quinoa salad from Costco, this one is just as good if not better with the feta cheese, sundried tomatoes, asparagus, and pine nuts! The portion is small though.  The pear gorgonzola thin crust was average. The crust itself was crunchy on the edge and chewy in the center. It was alright.. The amount of pear and gorgonzola they used is just ridiculously little. There were a total of 7 thinly sliced pears over the whole pizza. The gorgonzola was almost non-existent. I had to dig through the pile of greens in the middle to point out the gorgonzola to my mom. The caramelized onions on the pizza stood out and sort of made up for the lack of pear and gorgonzola!

201,IYelpFor U.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,91,74.0,2.0,2012-07-06,"CPK used to be good, but it is not worth the money these days. Their pizzas are known to be sweet and small, and if you've ever had pizzas from places like Avanti, or even from an authentic Italian joint like 'Charlie's Trio' then CPK is considered nothing more than just a quick fix. I can't speak for everything else on their menu but I can definitely chime in for the pastas -- and sorry to say but they just plain ol' sucked! I've had them in Vegas, then back home in the Pasadena location, and finally, this location and they're all consistently sub-par. A friend bought me some take-out (Jambalaya) from this kitchen and it was the biggest turn off from beginning to end. First off, whoever prepared the dish made it with Fettuccine...(wtf?)...instead of Linguine, even though the original from the menu (which I've had three times in the past) was Linguine. I was furious as hell when I opened the tray at home. Somehow, the food also tasted extremely bland and at the same time packed with lots and LOTS of sodium! The only thing my palette picked up was cumin, and the dish was lacking many of the essential spices that needed to make a great Jambalaya.  The thing that got me most was how they packed the two slices of bread along with the little butter packets; as I wasn't thinking anymore since the dish was so screwed up that when I peeled opened the butter it has completely melted to a watery state and dripped all over the place. Thanks to the idiot who: 1. Made the awful 'fettuccine' Jambalaya instead of with linguine, 2. Put the cold butter on top of the hot take out!  ....and for this, CPK is an epic fail!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=240,3.76,3.76,3.76,2.6960000000000006,3.76

I haven't been to CPK in couple years but I remember loving the pizza before. I guess I've been spoiled by artisan pizza around LA or something because I could taste the difference in the crust!

170,Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750.0,1.0,2013-02-26,"Despite me coming here more often than I'd like to, I really really really dislike CPK, especially this location. If it weren't for my best friend Jessica C., who loves this place to pieces, and the occasional family member who wants to dine here as it's nearby, I would never visit. I've been here more times than I can remember since the restaurant has been around for ages, dating back to my primary school years. CPK has always been a mediocre chain restaurant to dine in if there were no better options because at least, the food is consistent. However, considering the past couple of times I've eaten here, I really wish it'd close for something better to move in. Service is absolutely terrible. Yeah, I get that it's CPK and quality service isn't expected but I still do have some standards. During one of my most recent visits on a weekend night, it was no surprise the restaurant was busy. The wait was about 30-40 minutes long, but the host said it'd be okay if we left our number and walked around the mall. He reassured me he would call us when our table was ready. We walked around the mall for a bit and ended at Brookstone's, spending the rest of our remaining waiting time in glorious massage chairs. Twenty minutes passed... Thirty minutes passed... We then realized it'd been well over an hour, and still no phone call. We decided to stay in the chairs for a bit longer and eventually went back 90 minutes after we had left our number with the host. The restaurant was empty, as it was already around 9:30 pm, yet we never received a call. We told a different host what happened and the only thing he did was quickly apologize and seat us. I'm sorry, you just wasted an hour of our time, and the only thing we get is an insincere apology? During another recent visit, after the incident above, they really put my patience to the test. Going in on a weeknight, the restaurant was practically empty. Yet the host refused to seat us because ""the restaurant was behind"". I told the host I understood, but asked if we could we at least be seated. He dumbly repeated that the restaurant was behind. While we waited, we discussed leaving and going to another restaurant, and miraculously, we were seated in one of the many open tables. Our server Jassmine, was just as annoying. While things started decently at first, the later it got, the worse it became. She only came up to us twice during our meal to check on us and never offered to refill our drinks; we always had to ask. When we asked for chopsticks for the Kung Pao pasta, she forgot and never brought them; my mom actually got up and went looking for some, until another server asked if she needed help. For most of the meal, Jassmine was off walking around, handholding (yeah idk), and chatting with other servers. It wasn't until a manager noticed, that she stopped talking -- yet, she never came to check on us. I get it's a slow night, but that doesn't excuse why there are empty dishes and empty glasses on our table. Are we supposed to refill our water ourselves too? There's not much they can do to rectify what happened as it's already in the past, so it's safe to say I'm going to make it a point to never come here again. I don't care how badly any of my friends or family members want to dine here, I refuse to step another foot into this location.

Although when I asked the server for butter for the bread she replied, ""We don't do that anymore, we serve oil & herbs with the bread."" I said OK but I found that off putting because whats the big deal about getting me some butter?  The new bread is a baguette that does not taste fresh and isn't as good as their previous bread that was offered. The decorations were old and the painted pizza boxes on the wall were dusty. It seems as though CPK is trying to cut costs with the bread/cheap napkins and it clearly shows.Though oddly enough when we asked for our food to go, they placed it in a large container and in a enormous togo bag; which seemed unnecessary and wasteful. But that's not my biggest ISSUE here... Later on in the evening when I chomped in to my CPK pizza leftovers I bit something that was awfully chewy. I thought well maybe it was a really rubbery mushroom so I swallowed it. I dove in for my second chew when I felt that odd rubbery sensation on my teeth again. I STOPPED chewing. I pulled the unknown ingredient out of my mouth and it was a HUGE knotted up RUBBER BAND!!!!!! I untied it and showed it in disgust to my family. ""Look what the hell I just found BAKED in our pizza!!"" I found it really appalling that my previous bite and swallow was a rubber band also, from the same taste and chew that I had assumed to be a mushroom. My friends and family told me to call and complain. It was already too late in the evening for that. Also I was probably going to get from the manager a doubtful ""Are you sure?"" And ""We're sorry."" So other then a stomach ache and an unpleasant experience to tell friends and family; there is nothing I gained from dining here. I shall not return. My advice to CPK is to train your prep and cooking staff to practice safer food handling/prepping techniques...and when a customer asks for butter with the bread; don't be cheap, YOU go back to the kitchen and get them some damn BUTTER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=220,3.2,3.42,3.42,2.3760000000000003,3.3320000000000007

So, on to the review with this location, as I had a bad experience at this CPK:  I was seated right away, outside the restaurant, which I didn't mind, except he walked us over to a table that had a huge mess on the floor.  Food everywhere.  My foot slipped in some as I sat down.  My boyfriend saw and told the host in a polite way: ""You may want to sweep over there"".  The host must have thought by my boyfriend saying it nicely, that it was optional.  He started to go on about how they only clean the floors at night when they close!!  After waiting 20 minutes or so to find parking, having my feet in other peoples food and almost slipping, I decided I couldn't really accept that response and as nicely as I could, told the host ""the better answer would be to ask us if we would like another table or bring someone over here to sweep.  If someone spilled liquid on the floor you would clean it up so no one slips - I slipped on this food, it's the same thing!""  He looked at me like I was completely nuts, said OK and walked away.  My feet stayed in food the rest of the time we were there as he glared at me through the window.  I wondered if my food would be OK and free of spit.  It came out looking OK except it was quite overcooked.  I tried to eat it... crap, it's hard as a rock and tearing up the roof of my mouth.  I take the salad off the pizza and underneath is burned cheese.  My waitress was nice and offered to have them make a new one and asked if I wanted soup, but I can't eat the soup (meat).  But she did say they had a new dough and maybe it was that, that was different.  It was definitely overcooked and you could see the burned cheese and dough, as was my boyfriends but he was too hungry to complain much (except to say there is more meat on the Sicilian frozen CPK pizza than the one he got at CPK).  The second pizza wasn't overcooked and all was fine.  I just couldn't believe the excuse about cleaning.  I should have taken a picture, it was too gross! Update: I sent them an email about the experience and got back a ""we will look into it"" email and never heard back.  I did end up going here once more because I had a gift certificate and the food was decent and the place was more cleaned up, but the outside still could have used a sweep.  My waitresses here have always been nice, I think it's the managers that are incompetent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=280,3.28,3.43,3.43,2.308,3.37

Good appetizers in my opinion, would be the avocado rolls -- although it's not a huge portion. So boo to that. For entrees, I usually enjoy the Thai Chicken Pizza -- it's such a unique pizza, that only CPK would be carrying it. For pastas, I like the Tequila Chicken Fettucine, it's just simply amazing with the creaminess and a hint of lime, making this dish not too overbearing with the creaminess. On top of that, you can definitely taste the freshness of the olive oil (as weird as that may sound).  Service here is always amazing. I don't think I've ever had a bad waiter/waitress. In fact, one time I was so hesitant on trying a dish, the waitress told me if I didn't enjoy it that I can always exchange for a different item. HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! Overall, I love it here.

240,Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6051.0,2.0,2013-10-20,"I don't come to California Pizza Kitchen as much as I used to because I feel like the quality and quantity have both declined.  The service used to be impeccable, but the waiters and waitresses that I have come to recognize don't seem to be working here any longer. There are some days where you'll be lucky and have a more attentive waitress, but lately it seems like they don't know how to efficiently do their jobs and communicate with the other staff members. A few weeks ago, we had asked for water and it never came. We flagged down another waitress who flagged down our main waitress. The water still didn't come so we asked a waiter. It took a really long time before we ended up getting those water cups. And we had also asked for the complimentary bread and oil, which didn't come out. Our waitress was nowhere to be found and when she finally walked out to do her rounds, our food had already arrived. And one more incident that made my boyfriend upset was that the Sicilian pizza we had ordered was cold when they served it to us. When we asked our waitress if she could reheat it or have it remade - the dish it came on and the pizza itself was cold like it had been sitting outside for awhile before it was delivered to us - she looked like she didn't want to do that. We had to convince her that we had gotten cold pizza before she took it back inside. She didn't come back to our table until we flagged down a random waitress for the check.  My favorite two dishes from CPK are the Fettucine Alfredo and the Barbecue Chicken Pizza. The alfredo sauce is still really nice, but there are times the pasta is more chewy and hard than soft. As for the pizzas, I feel like they are shrinking more and more in size. They keep coming up with new crusts, but I feel like these ""new ideas"" only cause the pizzas to get smaller (crusts better, pizza smaller?).  This more negative review isn't based on only one visit, but an accumulation of 3 separate visits, where I felt like the service became more and more poor. Our waiters and waitresses who used to serve us with a smile are no longer here, and the new ones who are don't seem to offer the same service that the old ones did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=140,2.8,3.28,3.28,2.568,3.088

So the complimentary bread they used to give comes with butter right?  Well... I guess everyone is trying to go the healthier route... bread came with a side of olive oil and herbs.  Still yummy, but I kinda missed the butter...  at the waiting area they displayed a new Chickenpox Tequila Fettuccine, looked soooo good, had to try it!  BF on the other hand LOVES Pizza!  He got the Wild Mushroom pizza with Truffle Oil.

Lightly dressed, clean and fresh, sundried tomatoes were tart and flavorful, with the combination of the lemon vinaigrette, almond and parmesan cheese, this salad we divine! The mushroom pizza came out looking dry... only because the truffle oil was served on the side.. WTF REALLY!? Ok.....?? Normally the chef would brush on the truffle oil so the pizza is evenly coated... Pshhh.... mushroom tasted great, like fresh produce good. Pizza dough was flat but not flat bread, and it felt like it need higher heat in the oven because the dough was under soft and flimsy Pasta, great flavors, but pasta texture not so much... didn't feel like fresh pasta, felt like expired pasta, not sure how to explain it... no boing?

108,Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717.0,4.0,2014-01-04,"Came by here on New Year's day for lunch with my mother and my husband since we were hungry while scoring some excellent new year sales deals. We walked up to the hostess desk/ podium a little before 12 pm and were seated immediately inside the restaurant (there is tables outside of the restaurant you can sit at).  This is what we ordered: Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($9.49 prior to tax)- this appetizer came out pretty quickly actually, which was nice because we were quite hungry and the complementary bread just wasn't enough. The chicken mixture was really good and wasn't too greasy. The lettuce we got were only 5 pieces and wasn't sure if we had to pay extra for more so we didn't bother to ask. But it would have been nice to have a few more lettuce pieces.  Caramelized Peach Salad (full size $11.99 prior to tax)- I added salmon to this salad ($4.59, prior to tax, extra for that) to give this salad a bit more substance and protein. This salad was really good because of the flavors all mixed in with every bite. The caramelized peaches added a bit of sweetness and the feta cheese added a bit of saltiness. But I think there was a bit too much feta cheese though (I'm not really a big fan of feta cheese, or really any cheese added to my salad in general... I really like melted cheese in a sandwich more). The dressing was nice and light. I loved the dried cranberries and pecans added to this salad as well. It was also great that this salad was made with the dark green leafys instead of that cheap iceberg lettuce. I would have preferred the red onions to have been caramelized instead of eating them raw.  California Club Pizza ($13.29 prior to tax)- When I saw this pizza brought to this table, I thought it was just a salad placed on top of pizza crust and didn't think this was going to be a good pizza (my husband picked this dish). But I was surprised that I actually liked it. There is a little bit of bacon on the very bottom of the crust which gives it a saltiness and added crunchy texture. The tomatoes and dressing with the lettuce on top of the pizza crust was really tasty. I also liked the creaminess of the avocado pieces as well.  As soon as our server greeted us, she immediately brought over a plate of complementary bread slices with an olive oil dip. It was good, but sadly only came with 4 pieces.  Our server was very friendly and pretty good at refilling our drinks most of the time during our dining experience. She was helpful in answering our questions about the menu as well. Overall, the food was pretty good. I was a little apprehensive to eat here though because of the yelp reviews. The last time I came here was over 10+ years ago (when I was still in high school...yea, I'm totally old) and I thought the food was good. So I was happy to see that this place still is just as good as it was back then and wouldn't mind coming back here again for lunch with the family.

But then we noticed that all of the servers were asking the new patrons if they wanted bread which we obviously didn't get asked and we obviously didn't have any plate on our table for us to snack on before the main meal came.

We got two margherita pizzas, ""the works"" pizza and avocado egg rolls. I didn't try the works pizza but my dad said it wasn't great. The margherita pizza was not good either. It honestly didn't taste like anything. There was patches of cheese so not every bite had cheese, & just overall it didn't have much flavor.  The best thing was the avocado egg rolls but even then, those weren't that great. They tasted like chicken bacon ranch sandwiches w avocado from subway.  For 3 pizzas & egg rolls, the total came out to around $70. For the price, it was DEFINITELY not worth it.

I have to say that I am seriously not a big fan of corporate restaurants.  Most of the time foods at corporate places are all frozen and the air smells of misery and minimum wage.  But you know what?  CPK employees ACTUALLY SMILE!  That's so rare because at most times, employees use their portray how they feel during working.  It's as if CPK employees are programmed with binary codes to produce happy feelings.  Or what if they actually are happy there? CPK is the same at most places, but I tend to love this location in Arcadia.  It is slightly overpriced and they have gone through quite a few changes since the other times I have been here.  Some examples are: - Bread is different than before.  It has more of a Mediterranean taste with olive oil and spices than with butter. - There are bottles of sparkling water on the side. - Pizza and food are always changing here.  Two of my favorite pizzas, Shrimp Scampi and Mango Tendori, are now gone forever.  I also forgot to mention the Singaporean Spring rolls. - Atmosphere has somehow changed and is slightly less Chaotic than it was before. Regardless of the changes, the food is always surprisingly consistent and great.  I especially love their mushroom pizzas.  The Kung Pao Spaghetti is an excellent addition as well.  There are other small bites and what not but I'll leave that for you to decide :) Tips: -Parking is easy. -It gets super busy during weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=160,3.28,3.19,3.19,3.12,3.226

118,Aron K.,"Pasadena, CA",12,14,63.0,3.0,2014-09-14,"We went to this CPK today.  We ordered 2 pizzas (tostada thin crust pizza & works original pizza) and one dessert for a total of $50. Here are some things we experienced: It took almost 45 minutes from the time our order was taken until we received the pizzas. Bread started did not come until 30 mins from the time our order was taken.  The first thing we noticed was that the wall at our seat does not seem to be cleaned for a long time. It was quite dusty (see picture). Once the bread started came, it was mediocre at best: does not look like it was fresh from the oven and the olive oil dressing was bland..... meh.... it's free! who am I to complain.  =D Then the Pizzas came. The tostada thin crust pizza was burnt (mostly at the bottom and a little bit on the side) to the point that it was bitter. It was probably baked too close to the fire. The black bean paste was too little for our taste. It was quite tasty, though.  The work pizza was baked perfectly. However, the taste was mediocre for a $15 pizza. It taste the same like a $8 pizza I can get from my school cafeteria.  The dessert: We decided to try their new dessert: Salted Caramel Pudding.  It was nice. The sweet taste balance the saltiness of the salt. I did not like the ""black cocoa cookie crumbs"" at the bottom. Caramel was too weak. The mousse taste like a store-bought product.  The only reason we did not give it 2-stars rating is because our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Note:  at the end, my wife saw that one of the 'order ticket' fell onto one of the pizza on the kitchen counter. Then, one of the server just picked it up and continue to serve that pizza.  I know that this may not be a big deal for some people.

Smaller sized restaurant but consistently great customer service, and always a small wait time. They were PACKED Sunday around 1:30p, but we were seated within 5min. They were giving free small appetizers if you signed up for their free rewards program (collect points, get money off when you  reach certain amount of points) which was quick and easy, got our free guacamole and chips which was delicious. Guacamole was very fresh and flavorful. Our waitress was VERY busy but still very attentive. She came by 2 or 3 times to ask how the food was, refilled our drinks and brought out bread a couple times too. She may have been overwhelmed by all of the tables, confusing us with other tables bringing boxes or appetizers to the wrong table, but she was very sweet and sincere about it so it wasn't a big deal. Plus, she was working her butt off on a busy day. Only negative here is their prices. I've seen them steadily increase over the past couple years, and I think they're pretty ridiculous now. I remember when their individual pizza's were 11-12 bucks. Now almost all of the pizzas are close to $15, and not one of the salads were below $13.

I used to come here a lot when I was younger, since my cousins from Korea would like to come here. I came here for the first time in a couple of years, however, this past August with a couple of friends after we had watched a movie at AMC. The CPK is large with both indoor and ""patio"" seating (still indoor however) and we were able to be seated immediately. Service was pretty good since we came here for an early dinner and the place was not yet completely busy. CPK used to have this Chicken Tikka Masala pizza that I absolutely loved, but then they took it off the menu. That upset me, which is why I avoided coming here for a couple of years--nothing here is as good as that pizza! :P Anyway, we decided to split two pizzas between the three of us. We wanted to try some new styles, so we ordered the following: 1) CALIFORNIA CLUB: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, arugula, torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayonnaise. -- This seriously looked like a salad on top of a pizza. So much arugula and Romaine! The greens were a bit overwhelming; I'm not a fan of salads so I didn't care for this pizza very much. I did appreciate that each pizza slice got its own avocado slice, but there wasn't enough bacon for my liking. My friends seemed to like this pizza though. 2) SPICY CHIPOTLE CHICKEN: Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos, Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, cilantro and lime crema.  -- While this was a bit spicier than I expected, I ended up liking this pizza more than the California Club. It was more flavourful and I do love corn on pizzas. CPK has always been a decent choice for lunch/dinner. This location is convenient since it is at the mall, so if you are already there shopping why not stop by for a meal?

I thought their food is great, there's never one time I was dissatisfied with the dishes I ordered. I do have to agree at times that their services may be a bit slow and it's difficult to find your server at times, but other than that, when you do get your server's attention, they really accomodate and help you out.  I really think CPK have the best Tiramisu. Something about it that just kept me coming. You can really taste the rum in the Tiramisu as well. So it's wonderful. My girlfriend and I would celebrate our birthdays here together just for the Tiramisu.  I do though, dislike the California pizza where there's only avocado, lettuce and mayo all over the pizza. That was just a bit different. Not my kind of pizza. If you LOVE LOVE Avocado and don't want any meat on your pizza, I guess the California pizza is the way to go.  Their Kung-Pao Spaghetti is also pretty good. Who would of guessed Kung-Pao chicken with spaghetti would be such a great combo. If you feel like eating Chinese mixed with some Italian style noodles, just go with Kung-Pao Spaghetti, can't really go wrong with the name ""Kung pao "" right?

GRILLED CHICKEN CAESAR SANDWICH: A sandwich composed of grilled chicken, Caesar salad dressing, parmesan shavings, lettuce, and tomatoes on a parmesan herb cibatta bun. Comes with either a cup of soup or Caesar salad. I opted for the salad. Best deal for lunch IMO, not too much where you take any leftovers but enough so that it fills you up. PESTO CREAM PENNE W/ CHICKEN: Pretty good but not worth the extra $3 for the chicken. There were maybe 3-4 tiny pathetic pieces of chicken in there at most. Pesto flavor was a little too light.

80,Cindy L.,"Monterey Park, CA",155,294,413.0,4.0,2015-02-15,"Stuck between a three and four star for overall experience here, but I rounded up for old times sake. I used to really love California Pizza Kitchen, but my most recent visit just wasn't as pleasant as the rest. I'm thinking it was because Valentine's Day rush really slowed everything down. The boyfriend had work until the evening, and he chose  this place for our simple dinner together. We didn't know that there was a Valentine Day's special (from the Feb. 11th-15th) but we decided to throw in a couple more bucks and go with it since we wanted an appetizer and two entrees anyways. The special was: appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts for a total of ~$32 (without tax or tip).  There was a long wait, and I expected that at the time we were going. It was difficult to find parking and the estimated wait time was longer than provided though the hostesses were very nice and cheerful. We were starving and got Potato Corner while we waited. In the end, the total wait time was about 40 minutes. SERVICE I want to emphasize that our waiter was a really nice guy. He stopped by our table several times to check if we were okay, and we were. He apologized for our wait (for the table and food) since they are busy in the back, which completely makes sense since there were still people crowded around in front waiting for a table. FOOD/ DRINKS In terms of food, I just went home unsatisfied. I was full, but I didn't really enjoy the food. For drinks, I got the Fresh Mango Cooler, which tasted sweet and sour with a hint of mint and soda. The boy got his beloved Fresh Strawberry Lemonade and we had no complaints there.  For food, we ordered the Spinach Dipped Artichoke appetizer, Garlic Cream Fettuccine and The Original Hand Tossed Hawaiian Pizza entree, and Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The pasta, which I think I normally like, was lukewarm and a little dry - much different than what I had before. Hawaiian Pizza was not what I expected - much more plain than I remember. I only recall tasting ham and pineapple toppings on the pizza and either just didn't taste as fresh or hot. What I enjoyed most was our appetizer which came pippin' hot and delicious and arrived two minutes before the entrees.  I can overlook the time and wait for the table and food since I get that it was really busy and it was difficult to accommodate everyone, but I wish the quality of the food was worth the wait.  Almost $50 for a meal and it just wasn't that good this time. Sadly, I probably won't come back for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=80,3.4,3.18,3.18,3.12,3.2680000000000007

Me and my boyfriend got a gift card as a Christmas gift so of course we're going to use it. If we didn't have this gift card we probably would never come. Honestly, I'm glad we did because they upgraded a lot of their stuff here. The menu and the quality of the food definitely exceeded my expectations.  Service was super friendly and helpful. She always refilled our water cups when they were empty.  The free bread they give you as an appetizer tastes sooo much better now. In the past, they used to serve their bread cold, hard and with butter. Now they have a different type of bread that's bigger in size, fresh when it comes out, and with an olive oil sauce.  My boyfriend got the jambalaya and he said it was okay. It was a little heavy, but I think that's suppose to be a good thing. He just doesn't eat that much I got their arugula and asparagus small plate salad. It was delicious. I'm a big fan of arugula so I really enjoyed this dish. It also comes with shaved Parmesan cheese and almonds. This is a must get if you want an appetizer.  I also got the kung pao noodles. I liked this dish as well. It's not spicy like it says it is, but it has a really nice flavor to it. It might seem a little dry and lacking in sauce, but there was more sauce on the bottom and just mixed everything up. The noodles are linguini and I liked the crunch of the peanuts. This dish is a must get as well.

They added lots of different options to the menu now, like salmon, ribeye, tacos, etc. Of course, pizza is the best to get here but the other dishes are above average too. We got the shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread, my favorite appetizer here! If you register for rewards (just by putting down your email), I think you can get this menu item for free. Saladwise, I've always liked the California Cobb salad. Soups aren't really my thing here.  For pizzas, you can't go wrong with the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, always my favorite one. My sister likes the Hawaiian pizza but since no one wanted to share with her, she got a kid's size. Don't forget that you can get a kid's size if you want a smaller portion of something! They have a kid's menu available separately. And I also really like the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza. You have to add some money but I think it's worth it if you get your pizzas with a thin crust. The only thing I was annoyed about was that they didn't cut the pizza evenly, one part was WAY too large and one part was way too small, so we kind of had to recut it ourselves. If you're feeling like pasta, I love the kung pao spaghetti! The chicken tequila fettuccine comes in second for my favorite pastas here.

Most restaurants I've been to have a plate and utensil set at each seat. Also, there were more plates and utensils at our table than the amount of people in our party. The food we ordered took a really long time to come out--at least 30 minutes. During that time, we didn't see the waiter at all. Actually, during the whole meal, we barely saw the waiter. I felt we didn't get much attention; I don't know if it's because the place might have been understaffed or the waiters were spending more time on the ""wealthy"" Asian families that were there. The food wasn't bad nor was it impressive.

On the way to the very back of right back I saw two other tables available.   The server told us right off the bat that he was super busy but he'll be back to get our order.  We didn't see him for at least another 10 minutes.  We did get water and bread while we waited but we were starving.  When he took the order from her table behind us he drops by to say he will be back I told him we were ready to order.  He took our appetize, pizza and pasta order.  I think he put it all in at the same time because our pasta was Luke warm by the time they delivered it.  The table to north of us confirmed that that we got it cold.  Their pasta was steaming and ours was not.  For the 40.00 spend plus the tip was not worth it.  I won't be back.  He only refilled my water once and never came back to us.  Service was below e standard.   The manager came to check on our table  but it was before we really dug into our food.  Looking back I should have said something.  So I guess I will write about the experience now.  The garlic cream was not delicious like I remember it.  I asked one of the server who packaged our meal to go if they changed the recipe she said it had been years they made a change.  She said that now the sauce is prepackaged now,  well it use to be my favorite place it is now on the bottom of my list.  It is expensive and not worth the money.  I rather go to Cheesecake Factory.  There was no wait here and like an hour wait at cheesecake I see why.

42,David L.,"Arcadia, CA",188,183,68.0,3.0,2015-07-12,"Located at the Santa Anita Mall upstairs by Macy's. Good luck finding parking during mall rush hours, best bet is to park by Nordstrom's past the underground parking structures.  During Lunch and Dinner hours, this place can get pretty full. Best bet is to avoid dining in and getting it as takeout as nobody really does takeout... also you don't have to tip.  The food here is pretty good, however it is higher in price for a smaller portion. Their ""small plates"" are more of appetizers. I ordered the Mac and Cheese small plate thinking it would come in a small plate as the title would suggest, but I just got 4 fried mac and cheese shaped like chicken nuggets. For $7 that's pretty outrageous. Also, it wasn't even that great, it was fairly dry, and lacked the mac n' cheese flavor. The main course was more flavorful, and it came in a decent sized portion, however for the price I would've expected a little more.  Their deserts however, does not compare to Cheesecake Factory. I got the Key Lime Pie and hated it. It was more bitter than sour. It was pretty hard to eat. If you were planing to get desert, get it somewhere else like Cheesecake Factory which is also located at the mall.  Overall, this place is decent, however their food portions could be better, as well as the seasoning of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=60,3.68,3.32,3.32,3.1480000000000006,3.4640000000000004

Lobster something- just mayonaise and lobsters on fried tortilla. Avocado Rolls - the best item on their menu! Later towards the end of our meal, I noticed that everyone received complimentary bread.

The waitress that we had in the beginning she was very attentive, then a man came and requested for her to be his waitress and she just totally forgot about us. I had to ask another waitress to get our refills and everything else. Then our original waitress notices that we were close to being done and gives us our check, I told her that it's my birthday month and so I would like my free dessert and she was like wait I have to check your rewards. I had also asked for her to pack our leftovers. She comes back and says yes that I do have a free dessert. So 2 other waitresses brings it out and asks everyone if the desert belonged to then and never gave it to me. They went back inside to ask my original waitress and then one of the lady brings it out and asks if I ordered it and I said yes. She then tells me o she was gonna give it away (in a mean way) since she didn't know who it was for. So when we finished and I paid, the waitress never brought me back my leftovers (packed) so I had to ask her, mind you, most of the time she was tending to that man that requested for her and he was just sitting behind me. They were big time flirting too and being touchy. How professional is that! Anyhow, she was clueless about what I was talking about then she was like omg, I forgot! DUH!

When he finally decided to bring us bread I asked for the plate and of course he forgot. Not until right before our food was brought out did I get my plate. We ordered two pizzas and a large Chinese chicken salad. The salad was awful!! It felt as though it was from the day before. Super soggy and maybe a coupe pieces of chicken.

Spicy fennel sausage + poblano served on flatbread is a delicious small plate! Hand torn sausage, poblano and light cheese over flatbread. The poblano pepper slices are not very spicy and add a nice little kick to it. Great appetizer for a small group of four. Roasted garlic chicken pizza is my all time favorite! I think they removed this item from the menu a few years ago but it might be back as a seasonal item. Roasted garlic and sweet Caramelized onions add great flavor to this dish. I really hope they decide to bring this item back to the menu or at least bring it around more often! Can't go wrong with this pizza!!! Shrimp scampi with zucchini has an ample amount of zucchini in it! Don't forget to have them grate some fresh Parmesan over it! The shrimp is fresh and there are garlic bits on it which taste delicious! Farmers Market Soup is another newer item I haven't tried. If you like butternut bisque this is a top choice of mine. Roasted squash and corn with a touch of cream. It's not too rich and has a nice light flavor. Cobb salad is pretty standard. A good choice if you like bacon!

Our waitress never remembered nor asked if we needed anything.  She brought my salad without the extra dressing I had requested when she took my order.  By then I was so frustrated that I did not want to bother asking for it and have to wait or have her look bothered.  I have experienced bad service here at least 2 other times in the last 4 months.  My daughter and I really enjoy the food here but are having second thoughts about coming back.  Sorry I just felt I needed to share this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=220,3.48,3.55,3.372,2.8200000000000003,3.5220000000000002

It's located on the 2nd level floor of the mall (near Macy's) and the outside promenade doorway (facing All That Barbecue KBBQ) and when you walk up, try to find the hostess as soon as you can to get your name down on the seating list.

There are 3 primary seating areas: 1) inside, 2) outside in the outside promenade area & 3) outside of the restaurant inside the mall. Service here has always been pleasantly good for me.

I wasn't or hadn't been upset until I called back curbside to inform them.  I was immediately transferred to ""take out"" and spoke to this horribly obnoxious girl. She picked up the line asking the usual ""how can I help you..."" and when I started to explain the situation she abruptly interrupts what I'm saying and starts talking over me: ""yeah we know okay, we just sent the girl back she's new so she forgot it."" Um okay? That was my response. Um okay...? I get a condescending sorry from her and I then explained that my annoyance was not with the new employee she's throwing under the bus, but with her cutting me off and speaking to me with an attitude. She responded with yet another condescending apology. I hung up. I can't deal with incompetent employees who are brave over the phone.  The chick that brought the pizza the first time came back and was apologetic. I told her it was no big deal and we drove off. That's it. That's all it had to be. We could've ended it there, but her coworker decided to give us her horrendous attitude. And by the way... it is inexcusable and completely unprofessional to throw another employee under the bus to take the blame off of yourself. Even if it was the ""runners"" responsibility to assemble the complete order, this girl on the phone was incredibly rude to a customer who didn't see the situation as a big deal until she opened her mouth. Now she's earned a two star review for CPK and a zero star review for herself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=40,3.44,3.59,3.388,2.9200000000000004,3.5300000000000002

The open air (inside the mall) kind of helped open the space and make the restaurant feel more spacious. They did a great job to make it clean and modernized.  We haven't been to this CPK in a while, but last night we were celebrating the in-laws wedding anniversary and they wanted to come to CPK.   Sunny Side Up Pizza - 3/5 If you like breakfast foods, this is the pizza for you. They didn't really cut the slices evenly, but it was probably because they didn't want the sunny side eggs to get runny. The bacon and potato skins were crispy and delicious. If there was Tapatio, I think the fish would have been better.  Kung Pao Spaghetti - 3.5/5 We'd had this dish before and it's worth getting. The spaghetti was a little sweet and not too spicy, even had a hint of peanut butter to it. If you like Kung Pao Chicken, you will like this dish.  Spaghettini with Salmon - 3/5 When the dish came it smelled really fishy (total turn off). Once I tried a bit, the fishiness wasn't terrible, but the fish itself was on the oily and bland side.  Quinoa and Arugula Salad - 5/5  I liked this new dish the best, the toppings with the quinoa and arugula made the salad light and appetizing.  Overall the remodel makes CPK more appealing and especially when the restaurant isn't as crowded and loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2,3.44,3.59,3.396,3.12,3.5300000000000002

This one is always a solid choice, though I really think it could use more chicken. There were only a few pieces on the whole pizza. It was mostly barbecue sauce. But it's a classic that everyone seems to enjoy. The main issue this time around was my dad ordered the five cheese and tomato pizza and my mom got a bowl of the pea soup. When the food came my dad asked for chili flakes and my mom asked for fresh ground pepper. They waited and waited for their condiments and they never came. I'd say it was about 15 minutes. My mom had to go ask our waitress, Sam, for the condiments because the food had gotten cold. A few minutes later Sam returned with a fresh bowl of soup for my mom and offered to box up the cold one for her. She also offered to heat up my dad's pizza. She was very friendly and kind, so this was a nice redemption to the service, but it still felt a little basic of a mistake to make. Condiments should come when the food comes out.

This time it was a little thicker and chewier - nice. We ordered the Wild Mushroom pizza, Five-Cheese and Fresh Tomato pizza, and the California Veggie pizza. My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza off the Kids' Menu.  Everyone in our party agreed that the five cheese pizza was the best. It's usually a toss up every time we visit, though! The last time the Wild Mushroom was the winner. This time around, the five-cheese had more cheese on it and the tomatoes seemed fresher. We also agreed that we wouldn't try the California Veggie pizza again. There was a sweetness about it (probably from the red onions) that we didn't quite acquire a taste for. The pepperoni pizza was a hit for my little one.  Service was friendly and attentive. There were a lot of open tables when we ate there since it was during off hours. It was nice of them to let us choose a table in the location we wanted.  If you feel like pizza when you're shopping at the mall, this CPK will hit the spot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2,3.32,3.52,3.388,2.9600000000000004,3.4400000000000004

Flavors are very sweet to the point where you are not going to want dessert. The chicken was dry, but I guess that is what all the sauce is for. The Buffalo Cauliflower was burnt.

My high school even held fundraisers here a few times. Unfortunately, as time continued to pass, I find myself more and more reluctant in coming back. Previously, I had memories of portions shrinking with time, but prices gradually increasing. In comparison to Cheesecake Factory, I much rather go there instead. Bread here is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hard and stale, sometimes it's fresh and pretty delightful. My staple item that I order every time I come is the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. Taste and quality of the dish had thankful stayed consistent.  Regarding this experience in particular, it was the service that really had me disappointed. As we ordered, the waiter didn't seem to listen to anything I was saying. He didn't follow through with what he said he'd help us with. When he came to check on us, he didn't acknowledge the menus that have been sitting on the table, stacked and ready for him to take away. He also disregarded our empty plate of bread. He didn't bother asking if we'd like anymore, but once my mom asked him, he brought out a new plate and left the other on the side.

I thought it was clear while we were putting in the order. I'm not complaining about the extra egg and I'm grateful we didn't have to pay for it, but it's the little details that go a long way. I know it can get busy, but I urge the staff to be more attentive. If someone were allergic to something, such errors could be a life or death situation.

In recent years, however, the place has shown a steady decline across the board.  The staff turnover doesn't seem to be an issue, as you'll see familiar faces sometimes, but no one is very friendly or attentive anymore. Based on multiple visits here over the past five years, I'd say the waiters and hosts have just kept caring less and less, which likely comes back to poor management.  Food quality is alright, but the only things I'd confidently recommend here are the pizzas and desserts. The fish and meat entrées usually run the side of dry.

The place was fairly empty. Table for 4 took about 10-15 minutes, not bad.  Sat down, waited 15 minutes for a server to come and ask for drinks/food. He took our order and said he'll bring bread and drinks right away. Took another 10 mins to get our drinks even though it was just water. Then about 5-10 minutes for bread after that.  Ordered: Chinese chicken salad, chicken tequila fettuccine, Thai pizza and the rib eye (med rare).  Food came out in the usual amount of time.  Chicken tequila fettuccine- liked the lime taste of the sauce but the chicken was dry and the fettuccine was a bit undercooked.  Rib eye- sliced this guy up and it was well done.. told the server and he said he wrote down med rare and will put in another order for us. We waited about 20 minutes for the 2nd one to come out... yet it was cooked to medium- well... forget about it. We didn't want to wait another 20 min for them to fix it so just shoved it down. It was dry and not how we usually like our steaks. Imagine how pissed Gordon Ramsay would be.. (we had the rib eye when it first came out at this location and enjoyed it very much. It was juicy and tender and we actually raved about it and craved it.) Disappointment all around this time.  Thai pizza- was pretty much COLD and dry. The sauce was non existent. Kind of feel like it was left there for a long time or if a different party ordered the wrong item and they left it there for the next party to order or something. Chinese chicken salad- to be honest and sad, this was probably the best dish we had. But again we really like the Chinese chicken salad here.  Like the first sentence said, our worst CPK experience yet. Service was slow and not how CPK usually is. The whole entire time, NO ONE came to refill our waters.

For the people coming to this mall i rather reccomend other chinese resturants here like ding tai fung!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2,2.92,3.37,3.36,,3.19
79,Kristine W.,"Arcadia, CA",266,65,36.0,3.0,2017-10-02,Seated really quickly on a Saturday night but the rest of the service was really slow. Waited over 40 mins to get our food. Asked for bread and it came out so hard I only ate the insides. Weird because it was also warm. Reheated after being stale maybe ? Also asked for vinegar to put in our olive oil. Waiter forgot about it but he apologized and brought it out after we almost finished the bread. Ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini substituted fettuccini with penne Because I love penne. Ordered this a while ago and it was much better before. There was a lack of sauce on my pasta which made it kind of meh but pasta was cooked perfectly. Waiter also never refilled my water even though he was holding a water thing when bringing me extra lemons for my pasta. I didn't ask because I thought he was going to refill it when I saw him holding it.... but I guess it's still my fault for not asking. Wouldn't come here again kinda pricey for what it is pasta ended up being around 19$ with tax and tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=40,2.96,3.36,3.352,,3.2
30,Kat D.,"Duarte, CA",6,139,10.0,5.0,2017-10-07,"Came here with my sister and daughter recently. Hadn't been in years. I had an arugula and quinoa salad. I was hoping for more arugula, but it was delicious, nonetheless. My sister and my daughter split the carne asada pizza, and they both loved it. Our server was friendly and the space is nice and clean. I'd come again just for that salad. Also, the manager when we visited came to check to make sure everything was okay. That was nice. You don't always get that in a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=20,3.04,3.36,3.364,,3.2320000000000007
6,Paul S.,"San Diego, CA",261,26,42.0,3.0,2017-10-17,"I like this place...their pizza and pasta are good. For dinner we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, the works, chicken Alfredo and the jambalaya pasta.  The pizzas were good. The crust was crispy. Not Soggy from the sauce. Good amounts of cheese and toppings. Enough in each bite. I like the bbq sauce. Nice combination of sweet and smoky. The onions were a nice touch. And the chicken was nicely cooked. Not dry. As for the works (I apologize if it's not the name of it hehe) the toppings were fresh. The mushrooms weren't off color. The peppers and onions crispy. The pepperoni flavorful.  Pastas were cooked to a nice aldente. The Alfredo sauce was nice and creamy. Good amount of garlic mixed in. The jambalaya pasta had strong flavors. Not to much heat which was good. Sausages and other proteins were delicious.  Overall a good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2,3.04,3.34,3.364,,3.2200000000000006
34,Jason F.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,9,1.0,1.0,2017-10-20,"I'm currently at the location at 5:52 PM October 20, 2017. Im already getting sh*tty service. Seating took way too long even though it's TOTALLY slow right now. Anyways, the server mar Lon ( syllables separated to avoid yelp's security settings) took long to even greet us and ended up not even giving his name; and had a personality that gave us the impression that we weren't worth his time. That wasn't even the reason for this review though. I needed just some SIMPLE balsamic vinaigrette...since our server is taking WAY too long, we tried asking another server, not once, twice...Three times! She didn't even give us the courtesy of saying anything. the second and third time she DIRECTLY looked at me, gave me a dirty ass look, and proceeded to ignore me. Her name is A-NA, hopefully the GM sees this. Anyways, the server finally came...thanks :) have a great day",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=20,2.88,3.31,3.356,,3.138
15,Victoria L.,"Temple City, CA",287,134,181.0,2.0,2017-10-22,"Came here for lunch and had to wait 10-15 minutes for a booth..even though there were a couple of empty table booths. Our server comes by to take our drink order then is no where to be found for a while when we were ready to order. Ordered the egg rolls, BBQ chicken pizza, chicken tequila fettuccine and strawberry Italian soda. The egg rolls were really good (even though I picked out the avocado), but for almost $12, 6 halves of egg rolls seemed a bit too pricey. It comes with ranch and ranchito dipping sauce, which was great for dipping. I didn't really like that there was lots of cheese and oil though. The BBQ chicken pizza was pretty good, but there was a bit too much BBQ sauce and not much chicken. The chicken tequila fettuccine had a kick of lime to it, which is pretty good if you like a light kick of sourness in your food. What I didn't like was that the portions were small for the fettuccine, but it is enough to make you feel bloated before even finishing it. I didn't like how it tasted really heavy and also disliked the bell peppers they put in there. For beverages, I ordered the strawberry Italian soda. What was weird was that there was a small amount of what seemed to be evaporated milk to pour in. I asked our server if I was supposed to pour it in with the soda and she said yes. The Italian soda tasted pretty good with the milk, but it just didn't feel too right doing that (soda with milk? Hmm..). It was good, but it didn't make me feel so good after. Overall, the food was somewhat decent. The server forgot to bring plates and utensils. She did come back to bring extra napkins and ask if I wanted a refill, but never asked how the food was. Ended up having to take the pizza and fettuccine togo. This place was pretty pricey for the quality of food, portion size and service you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2,2.8,3.32,3.344,,3.112

The service was slow on a Saturday night but it wasn't too crowded so maybe they were understaffed. Our waiter was nice so that made up for it.

Never refilled our drinks. The food was cold. And at the end when we were leaving we didn't couldn't get anybody's attention to give us a doggy bag. We left the food, we just want to get the hell out of there. The managers were delivering food, I don't know if they were short on staff. It was the worst experience I have ever had and I won't be coming back there for a long long long time. If ever!

There 2 ladies that came in after use. They did not specify a booth as we did. But, seems like they did I know the server. I know this because I was shown the seating list. After asking why they gave them our booth. They were taken to their table, as they were being seated they realized there was a Booth being cleaned and told the servers they wanted that booth instead of the table.  My issue is this. We were next on the list and the server should not has seated them there just because they decided they wanted it. They did not specify a booth or wait extra time for the booth as I did. At this point I told the manager and managing partner Latricia.  I've been eating at this CPK for a long time. Spent hundreds of dollars there. Not anymore!!!!!
