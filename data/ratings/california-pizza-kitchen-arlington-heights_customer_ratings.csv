15,Tom O.,"Chicago, IL",34,21,1.0,4.0,2012-07-04,"One of the best customer service exerpeiences I've had in a long time. We got seated fairly immediately. Right after getting seated, I went to the bathroom, and my friend went to the bathroom. In that time, no server had visited our table to greet us. When a server finally did arrive, she seemed a little frantic, it seemed that a miscommunication had occurred about who would be taking care of us. Not a huge deal to us.  However, that apparently was so much of a blunder that the manager visted our table and comped our whole meal. He even requested that we have dessert as their treat. The server that took care of us was wonderful: we're fans of the recently-retired BLT Pizza and she requested the kitchen make it even though it was off the menu. She also recommended an excellent salad for me.  Food was great! Everything tasted wonderful.  Not many restaurants I've visted would take the fault for such a minute error, let alone comp a whole meal to gain a customer's satisfaction. I was very impressed and appreciative of the manager and server. Outside of a tip, the least I can do is write a favorable review and revisit to bring them more business.

The best part is the variety they offer.  Basically any type of pizza you could possibly want, they have.  However, they won't be the best you've had. I had a Hawaiian pizza, which was good.  The pineapple was fresh and the cheese ample.  But it was missing that good ham that makes a Hawaiian pizza. They did offer delicious raspberry-lemonade and strawberry-lemonade, which I would get again. That is, if I go.  The price was a little to step to not try and find a better pizza in the area with a bit more character and a little less dough, no pun intended.  (These pizzas barely have any.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=20,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001

6,Ruma R.,"Schaumburg, IL",1,9,,1.0,2013-03-03,"Please note: This review applies to a Sunday night visit. I've been here a few times over the past few years. The food is usually decent and the service reasonably great. This time was a complete letdown. The best indication of how a place treats customers is to eat there on a Sunday night. Five weeks back, we did. Fernando, I think, (and I'm not sure, but I'm still venturing to use the name openly here because I was hopping mad by the end of our visit) was completely inconsiderate to us. He seated us, took our order (a pizza and a Kung Pao spaghetti which I've never tried before), and then disappeared to chat with a colleague. Luckily, we flagged him down and told him we needed an appetizer, which came in record time along with the pizza. However, as we (quickly) wolfed down the pizza, it seemed as though he was more interested in his chitchat than bringing us our spaghetti. It was around 5 minutes before closing (and this wasn't our fault--we had ordered at least 30 minutes in advance), he came up to us (real slick) and asked us if we needed anything else. Confused, we reminded him about the spaghetti. This was the exact exchange: F: Oh, I completely forgot about it. What was it, again? Kung Pao spaghetti? I'll tell them--they make it fast. (Glancing at kitchen--chefs were packing up). Us: (Confused and looking at each other) ??!!???  F: It won't take long. Us: (Exchanging exasperated glances) No, it's okay...(and before we could finish he pipes up) F: Oh, you sure? I can bring you something else--complimentary dessert or something? (Not pausing for us to respond) No? Oh, next time you're here just find me and I'll get you something special, okay?  (At this point, my husband and I were disgusted and completely put off and basically would have yelled and demanded an apology if not for the fact that it was 9 pm on Sunday night and we were exhausted. I'm yet to speak to the manager, and maybe I'll update after that).  Overall, disappointing, considering the food is pretty over-priced too. I think you'd have better luck eating there on weekdays or Saturdays, all of which times have worked great for me in the past.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003

My daughter Erika and I had never tried CPK but our friends had recommended it highly.,This is largely because of the always delicious food!   Erika and I enjoy the barbecue pizza and the avocado rolls...  and one really special waiter.  Fernando makes dining a pleasure from beginning to end. He is friendly,respectful, personable, efficient and always makes great suggestions. Last night he called our attention to a placard suggesting a red wine where some proceeds go to a heart association. Wow he had us! Erika turned 21 just two days before and there was something very special to celebrate! Last year Dr. Bakhos of Loyola University Medical Center replaced her aortic valve due to a congenital problem with aortic valvar stenosis.  The heart healthy drink seemed appropriate. Later, we chose a shared slice of refreshing key lime pie; what a treat!! The first time we had the pleasure of having Fernando as our waiter, he ended the meal by fashioning a rose out of a napkin. Such a kind thank you and so welcome!.The time was emotional yet Erika left smiling at the unexpected sweet ending to some time alone with mom. Now I have four children and a granddaughter ...so of course everyone wants this wonderful dining experience; kudos to the chefs too because we love the food as well!!! We look forward to our next visit and consider Fernando a dear friend of the family for making some moments of a very busy/crazy life moments to remember.

When coming to the downtown Arlington Heights location, you have to go in knowing that this place is pretty much run by female servers under the age of 22.  The service is always mediocre.  The food is usually consistent...the service not so much. They have recently switched up their crusts so pay attention when ordering.  Many pizzas now come on a thin crust and others with a new hand tossed style.  The past 3 times when ordering take out we've specifically asked for and described one crust just to receive another.  Mama Mia!  What's a girl to do?! Last week, we had a negative experience.  I had ordered a salad for my dinner.  While collecting my roasted vegetables and lettuce onto my fork, I noticed a long strand of BLACK hair intertwined within my fork and veggies.  Our servers hair was a light brown and was pulled back in a braid so I didn't think it was hers by any means, but it definitely belonged to someone else who had their hair dancing over my salad.  I tried looking to the kitchen to see if I noticed anyone with long hair.  The only one I could really see was another server with black hair prancing around the kitchen to help out.   She had her hair half up, with tightly hair-sprayed ringlets hanging on each side of her face.   I brought the hair to my servers attention at the end of our meal (because that's when she checked back with us).  She agreed it was gross and said she would bring it to the managers attention.  Minutes later she returned with to go boxes for us and our check.  No mention of the hair again.  Now, I'm never looking for a hand out, but you'd think the manager would come by to apologize or they would offer to re-make my salad, rather than assuming I want to take it home and munch on some more hair of a stranger.  Well, at least it wasn't something worse like a booger or a finger nail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

7,MARGARET B.,"West Chicago, IL",1,56,3.0,1.0,2013-10-06,Truly thought the staff was taken over by aliens. Not a one knew what they were doing and it was obvious from the get go. Our waitress greeted us asking if we would like a drink and then went on to name the specific coke products individually. I am assuming she had to memorize the menu and started with drinks. That is about all she had memorized as she had quite a difficult time taking our order. When our food was served to us by waitress it was to the right of our booth on a ledge that was closer to the kitchen instead of walking around to the front of our booth.  One in our party ordered Thai chicken pizza. Literally this was brought to our table a crust with vegetables (NO Peanut sauce and no or very little chicken visible).  We brought this to our waitress attention who in turned sent the alien manger over. He literally stared at the pizza for minutes before offering to send out peanut sauce. What I find appalling is this is a signature CPK dish and if you glanced at one that was made normally and what was served to us it would take a second to know a step or two was missed while preparing this dish yet the manager clearly did not recognize this fact. So clearly the  management and cook staff were aliens too!  This was eventually taken off our bill but needless to say our party of six had a sub par dining experience at CPK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.5960000000000005,3.3600000000000003

It was around 6:30 on a Friday night with no wait. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us throughout our meal. When our order arrived, our server told us he had dropped one of the tortilla spring rolls and that another order had already be placed. One order of spring rolls comes split into 3 pieces. Only one of the pieces had dropped, but we were given a new full 3 piece roll. We ordered the Baja Chicken and Thai Chicken Tortilla Rolls. Both were good, especially with the side dips: guac and peanut sauce, respectively. I would get the Baja Chicken again (because I liked the guac) and give the Mediterranean Veggie a try the next time we are at CPK. We also had the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach Flatbread (enjoyed/would get again), and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza (nothing too special about that one though).

46,Dotty T.,"Lake Geneva, WI",14,11,,5.0,2015-12-11,Perfect place for a kid friendly meal.  The food is good for adults and kids.  We love to sit by the windows so the kids can be entertained by the trains as we eat.  The staff is always attentive and friendly.  Our grandkids love going to CPK and ask for it often!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
37,Brenna M.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",291,70,11.0,3.0,2016-01-12,"I've eaten at CPK since I was a kid, and their menu has dramatically changed over the years. This is a great place to bring kids, even for their birthday. I've always had great service here whether I'm sitting outside on the patio or inside. It's in a good location downtown Arlington Heights, right next to the train tracks, which I personally like watching the trains go by as they are not noisy.  I recommend ordering their pizza, or if you're in the mood for a lighter dish, a salad. I've found their entrees aren't great. Another thing my family enjoys is the lettuce wraps (we get them with chicken and shrimp). Their pizza crust is delicious, and almost makes you want to get something fancier than a cheese or pepperoni. My favorite is the California, which has avocado on it (delish) and is less of a ""traditional"" tomato base with cheese pizza than you would think. I highly encourage ordering a cool pizza you couldn't get at a local pizza shop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

Coming here with my friends and family is always a great experience because no matter what, I always get friendly and fast service! The restaurant is always clean and the dishes are fantastic. (I highly recommend the garlic cream fettuccini or the jambalaya, it's to die for!) oh and if u have room after that definitely get the key lime pie or red velvet!! You can never go wrong with some red velvet and ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

Location.   The  salad was ok.  The server was attentive to a point.  In fact asking if we wanted boxes for our left overs. At which point we had not finished eating .we may not be back at this location . Melanie wanted me to add that the server should have been more  observant, that as baby boomers  we are a male and female couple.  Not guys as we were greeted .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

I had this young waitress trying to tell me maybe because it has lime in it. I told her i know my cosmos and normally when we come here they are great.  I did rememeber what the bartender looked like, a taller girl.

39,Alice S.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,5,,2.0,2016-12-05,"Takeout pizza was just dreadful. Dreadful. Cold hard and uninspired. Slightly better when warmed in the microwave. Had a cheese/sausage and mushroom/pepperoni/sausage regular crust. Picked it up well before the 20 minutes we were given. From now on, it's California Salad Kitchen for us. We only went there for a charity donation, which is nice of them. But yikes! What a disappointment. And I never thought pizza could be disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
34,Enrick Z.,"Villa Park, IL",23,1,,1.0,2017-04-03,"I love CPK, and I try to avoid posting any scathing reviews; But the service received today was downright awful; That I could not let this event go un-noticed! Arrived past noon for a lunch with a co-worker. Was seated promptly, and our server was quick to take our order. It took nearly half an hour for the food to arrive! In fact, another party (of 3 people) who came in 15 minutes after we came in received their food before we had!.  We ordered chicken piccata, egg rolls, and soup. By the time the food arrived; The egg rolls were cold! The chicken piccatta, and the soup were barely warm. I had to flag the server numerous times to even get her attention.  The server simply forgot about us, and didn't bother to check back. The restaurant was pretty sparse for a Monday, So I couldn't even blame it on the crowd size because there weren't that many diners! We sent the egg rolls back. The server at least apologized and offered to replace the egg rolls, but I told her that we had no time to wait and had to be back in the office. The manager approached our table and agreed with our assertion that the food was cold and he didn't know what happened, and offered to take the egg rolls from the check.  Received the check, in which the egg rolls were taken out and did not get at least a discount for the horrible service and the cold food. Come to think of it, the server didn't even bother to refill our beverage order while we waited for our food.  This will be the last time I go to this location and extremely disappointed for the lack of service, and generally not caring!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

33,Ana A.,"Prospect Heights, IL",0,4,,2.0,2017-06-08,Waitress was good!  Hostess is clearly not paying attention.  If someone asks to be moved away from a table with children WHY would you move them and then surround them seating parties of only children.  Seat parties w/ no children together; then parties w/ children together. That way everyone can enjoy there meal.  I couldn't finish my meal!!! 6-7-2017 Giving a second chance to CPK but itHappened again couldn't get seated INGRESS and Egress filled with families. I asked to be seated at the Bar another party also waiting  inline after me seated after ( also at bar) me gets greeted  and offered beverages I get a look but no service or we will be right there so before I get more upset I left AGAIN,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
32,Jen M.,"Schaumburg, IL",30,82,49.0,2.0,2018-01-14,"I'm a big CPK fan in general (see my five star review of the Schaumburg location), but I won't be back to this locale.  We came in for lunch yesterday and ordered the spicy cauliflower appetizer, a carne asada pizza and two kids' meals. The cauliflower appetizer is truly tasty but it consists of five pieces of roasted cauli. When you're paying close to $10 for this dish, one would expect to enjoy generous sized pieces of cauliflower. That was not the case today with one puny piece the size of a quarter.  The carne asada pizza was good with a yummy salsa verde. After stealing bites from the kids' meals, I'd say stick with Panera or Noodles for mac n' cheese. They also forgot the edamame we had ordered to go with it. To get it, we had to tell two people, and it finally came after 10-15 minutes when the kids were done with their meals. We were disappointed to see we were still charged for it when the bill arrived. Also, the kids' pizzas are way yummier at the Schaumburg location. My kid's bbq chicken pizza was on a thicker crust and featured sparse ingredients.  We're about as loyal as one can be to CPK, but sadly, neither the food nor the overall experience delivered at yesterday's lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
