I submitted my online order through   (which was anything but a seamless process) and selected my CPK order for pick-up. My e-mail confirmation said I should expect my order  to be ready in 20-25 minutes. I probably left my house about 35 minutes after I placed my order. When I finally arrived home with my pizza, after a 5 minute walk to and from CPK each way, my pizza was cold. What? Do you guys not have a pizza warmer to keep my pizza warm while you wait for me to pick it up? I know most people eat inside the restaurant, so this isn't necessary for most people, but you do offer carry-out. Sorry everyone can't be there the second the pizza comes out of the oven. When I think about the 5 people I saw in the restaurant when I went to go pick up my order, I assume my order was made in 15 minutes, max.

Our mojitos, dip, and soup came in a timely manner. The drinks were good as was the dip. The tortilla soup however was a little gross. It tasted like heated enchilada sauce with a mound of melted cheese. Probably will never get that again, but what do you expect when you're ordering soup from a chain restaurant? We had to wait for a very long time for our pizza. People that came in after us got theirs first. The kitchen might have forgotten about our order. The waitress made up for it with her kindness though. She seemed sincerely sorry that we had to wait and kept checking in on us to make sure we were okay.  When the pizza finally did come it was yummy as always.

The weather was fair, so I'm positive the walk had nothing to do with the food quality either.  The meat for the lettuce wraps was hot and tasty and about what you'd expect for a dish like this. The top leaf of lettuce for the wraps was crisp and green, however, every leaf below was brown and beginning to wilt. It made the dish very unappetizing, and I ended up throwing the lettuce away and eating the meat on its own.  The pizza was extremely cold and scarce on toppings. I believe I counted four scraps of chicken on the pizza as a whole, and it was as cold as might have been expected if I had left it out on the counter for an hour or more prior to eating it. Yet, it was the pizza that was supposedly holding up my order and forcing me to wait 15 minutes longer than the time I was told the order could be picked up when I made it online.  The one saving grace to the meal was the key lime pie, which is one of my favorites. The cream for the topping of it was fresh, and the pie itself was light and not overly sweet. It was the one meal item that I did throughly enjoy and felt lived up to the menu's description.  I travel to DC regularly and am unsure if I'll give this California Pizza Kitchen another shot. It's a chain I've never been hesitant to dine at before, but if I'm going to spend $32 on a meal, I'd like to at least feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I definitely can't say that was the case this time around.  Again, I want to stress that the customer service and attitude of the gentleman working at the take out counter was fantastic, and I didn't actually feel slighted as a customer until I went to eat my dinner.

I'm not sure if it's always been on the east coast but as a CA native, it was always within a 15-minute drive. I have seen it develop and essentially re-brand over the years. I remember the days with their bright yellow menus, when they would bring out sliced bread with butter and I would order ""corkscrew"" pasta with butter or a traditional cheese pizza for dinner. Now, they bring out bread with olive oil and I order things like mahi mahi tacos (which are quite delicious!). The menu and decor have evolved over the years, and while I wouldn't call it an upscale restaurant, it's more upscale than it used to be. I don't mind the changes but I can sometimes be nostalgic for the past. One thing I really love about this location is the photos on the wall. They have stunning metal photo prints of California and Washington, DC landmarks. They probably do this at other locations, switching out the DC photos for whatever locale in which the restaurant is located, but I think it's a super nice touch.  The pizza and pasta remain delicious. I don't often stray from what I know but everytime I have (like with the mahi mahi tacos referenced above) it's been a good decision.

I'm a firm believer that when you visit an establishment and they specialize in a specific food, you should order it, hence the reason I ordered a pizza. All the pizzas are personal size, so I ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza was just okay.  The sauce was bland, the crust was unmemorable and the pizza as a whole just seemed to be missing something....flavor, yeah...that's it.

I was very impressed that they had the Fallen Comrade Table set up in the entrance to honor the fallen, missing, or imprisoned military service-members. Honestly, this speaks highly of the establishment and I plan to dine here more often in the future. When we arrived, we were seated right away. We had Brenda as our server and she was friendly and attentive. For the appetizer we order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls which were phenomenal and perfectly fried. Even my not-easily-impressed BF said that he is going to order these every time we come. For the entrees, we ordered The Original BBQ Chicken and Five Cheese Fresh Tomato Pizza. They were both delicious and a lot bigger than I expected. My friend ordered the Thai Crunch salad, and it looked and tasted amazing. It was seriously the most delicious looking salad I had ever seen. Next time I am definitely ordering one. For the cocktail I had the Beehive Sangria. It was tasty and very refreshing.

Tonight was no different at Pentagon City CPK and probably one of the slowest service I've ever experienced. Our server, Dylan, was so forgetful or just plain bad at his job, it was ridiculous. He brings water glasses filled to the brim, but no straws. 20 minutes later he brings the lemonade and still no bread. Understandably, the kitchen was backed up due to a large party, but all we wanted were drinks and bread. Parties that arrived after us seemed to get everything before us.  When you have to ask 5 times for bread, something's gotta be wrong. It took close to 40 minutes before we were served just bread and olive oil. The entrees came much later. He was so SLOW. It honestly wasn't that crowded on a Monday night, as there were plenty of empty tables, minus the one large party. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but the service was horrific from beginning to end. We were cutting it close in time and needed a box for the pizza. When we asked another server who happened to walk by our table, she straight out refused to help us. She could have at least acknowledge our request, but instead she rudely dismissed us with a rude stare and asked who our server was. She waited until our server was in sight and directed him towards us instead. Really, you couldn't just give us a box? Is it that difficult?

Several minutes later a waitress came, did not apologiZe or even say who she was, and handed me a ginger ale. She never checked on me again. She handed me a pizza- no longer hot- without a word, and I didn't get a chance to ask her to refill my completely empty ginger ale. It took me a few minutes to flag her down after that and I asked. Please keep in mind that I've been nothing if not pleasant to her. But then before getting my drink she loudly started complaining to another waitress about the hostess overbooking her section. She's continued to stand there now for 20 minutes talking to other waitresses and I've yet been asked how I'm doing or if I need anything. I'm not sure how I'll get the check.
