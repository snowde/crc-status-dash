Large menu, kids menu -- something for eveyone. And sometimes you are craving a large salad piled high with goodies (that you didn't have to chop) and a pizza and if you go with family or dear friends it's a wonderful family style meal. The staff -- from the front door to the waitstaff and manager were so attentive and friendly. They kept things moving and when one of our dishes was delayed they stayed on the case and kept us informed until they not only corrected the mistake but gave us reason to return. Solid food. Stellar service. We'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=140,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.056,3.2400000000000007

Sitting and the bar, watching the workers in the open kitchen, and enjoying a drink and my company made for an enjoyable afternoon diversion.  Our server/bartender Marissa was really sweet and did a good job chatting us up without being too pushy or annoying us. Her shift ended and we had another guy ring us out, and he was also pleasant.

Well, the wait was 40 minutes long and so then we decided on CPK! I'm glad we did! The wait was a bit shorter, about 15 minutes, and we were seated at a booth near the window in front. Perfect seat. Our waitress was really nice, and after placing our drink orders, she disappeared and a new waitress arrived and let us know the first one had went home for the day. The 2nd waitress seemed distracted by all the commotion. I mean, it was a bit busy, but she couldn't even maintain eye contact with us as we placed our food orders with her. Anywho, eventually our pizzas came out and mmmmmm...  I ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken pizza, we also had a barbecue, pepperoni, and Japanese with Eggplant pizza. Immediately, we all did a trade-a-thon and sampled each other's pizza. I LOVED the Japanese w/eggplant that my mom had. It was delish! The pepperoni was good (can't really go wrong with that) and the barbecue was ok to me. Mine, the roasted garlic chicken, was really yummy as well. So, all in all, the food was good!  The waiters/waitresses were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. 3 times, 2 different waiters brought somebody else's entrees to our table. LOL!

I ordered the Italian Deli sandwich and a frozen strawberry margarita and normally I am in love with this meal. The Italian Deli sandwich comes with ham, salami, and pepperoni on herb cheese focaccia bread. This sandwich is usually amazing and I usually crave this sandwich for weeks to come! While the sandwich was still good, I didn't have the magical warm and fuzzy feeling that I have at the end of my dining experience at California Pizza Kitchen. Both side items are good. I enjoyed my Caesar salad but had the chance to taste the cole slaw and it was by far the best cole slaw I've ever had.  Moving along to my drink, I was so disappointed. The margarita lacked flavor... Maybe the bartender was new. I dunno. Just wasn't feeling it. Overall, the food was good... Just not great. Our server was friendly. I am not ready to give up on CPK...

74,Jason D.,"Atlanta, GA",262,371,44.0,2.0,2012-12-24,"Bland must be in high demand, man! We ate here so we could sit outside and hear the concerts going on outside at Atlantic Station, it was really the only affordable option to do so with a heated deck. I'd not eaten at a CPK in many years, because the last time I'd went I'd been underwhelmed, but every once in a while you are limited in your options. This was that time. This time, it'd be myself, my wife, and my in-laws.  My wife and I shared two pizzas, the Hawaiian and a Classic Pepperoni. My in-laws split a different pizza. First, the pizza. BORING. BLAND. Very little sauce added to the generic crust, with very little toppings. I understand they were busy, it was a Saturday night after all, but it seemed like it on the plate, and that's never ok. This pizza was no better and almost worst in some ways than frozen pizzas my wife makes at home sometimes. Certainly not worth the ridiculous prices they're asking for these things. Perhaps the BBQ Chicken pizza is slightly more worth it, but the pizzas I ordered sucked. Bad. Crust had no crisp, was chewy in the ""previously frozen, thawed out and heated up"" way. And man, come on, a little more sauce would have made it at least a smidge better. Then, there was the service, or, lack thereof. Maybe the guy didn't like coming out into the cold air. Whatever the reason, coming to deliver our food and coming to give us our check doth not count for real service. Drinks were not filled, we had to ask for plates to the manager, just a real lack of service at all. Guy was semi-friendly when he was around, just not very much around.  Overall, this is precisely what I remember from this boring, bland chain restaurant. Boring, bland, overpriced food.

I had no idea this location was even in Atlantic Station.  Gives me one more reason to like the place. We were already at Lenox Square, but they were no longer seating people, so thought we'd have to go to the location near Perimeter, which is in the other direction we were heading, so it was a delight to find this locale. Upon going in we were told there would be a 35 minute wait for a table, but we could sit at the bar if something became available.  Within 5 minutes, I was sitting at the bar and ordering my drink.  We were offered an outside table, but in 35 degree weather in late December, I don't care if there are heaters, I'm not spending $15 on a pizza to sit outside in the cold to eat it.  I've been a fan of the chain, and this visit made me just as much so.  Our waiter, Brent, was not all smiles and charm, but he was efficient, quick, and didn't let us go lacking for anything napkins, honey for our hot tea, water, appetizers, and PIZZA. His facial expression didn't change one bit the entire nite.  Not even when I asked him if he could make me a hot toddy.  He ran down the list of teas, I made my choice and he bought back to me in the nicest presentation.  Just like some high end place.  Small things like that make me happy.  My usual even when I buy CPK pizzas to pop in the oven at home is the BBQ chicken pizza.  I went with it again. I also had a wedge salad that as wedge salads go was fresh, had enough dressing and I was able to share it with my mother.  I don;t go for all the other tasty brands of pizza they hawk.  some places do certain things well, and for CPK its the BBQ chicken pizza.

We had never been to CPK despite all the good things we had heard, so we decided to give it a shot. We were seated right away and greeted by our waiter ""Really Good Actor"".  My wife asked him to repeat his name, and sure enough he said it again: ""Really Good Actor"". Never caught his real name, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume he is an aspiring Thespian.  Either way, he was a very nice enthusiastic server who lifted our spirits, and I hope his acting career takes off. Drinks were obviously made with high-end ingredients and were not watered down at all.  If you're looking to get a buzz before dinner, try the Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea.  There was a minor issue with my wife's drink, but RGA took care of it right away. For appetizers we got the Tortilla Spring Rolls.  Fresh, flavorful and just downright good.  That Thai peanut sauce was awesome all by itself. I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine, and when I ordered it RGA got a look on his face of excitement that told me this was one of his favorite dishes.  And I saw why.  Perfect Cajun spices that weren't over-the-top hot; perfectly-cooked pasta and lots of shrimp, sausage, chicken and crawfish.  It seemed to get better and better the closer I got to the bottom of the bowl.  Hope my wife wasn't embarrassed because I HAD to grab some bread and sop up the rest of that sauce.  It would have been a shame to waste it!   RGA suggested the butter cake for dessert.  His exact words were ""it's a beast"".   It is indeed... Think of the best pound cake you've ever eaten, and then think of that cake on steroids.  Heat it up and throw some Haagen Daz on top then drift off into a sugar coma. Great dining experience for food and service.  We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=80,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9960000000000004,3.4400000000000004

I think this mostly occurs during the summer so check it out before coming out.  The service here was attentive and great. The food was pretty good; it wasn't super super awesome or divine but merely good. Some of the pizza creation was unique: Thai chicken and the pear gorgonzola. The pizza size here was funky: it is between a personal pan pizza and a medium pizza. I chose the pear gorgonzola (a type of cheese). It had unique ingredients and tasted unique as well. The hazelnut slices (?) atop the pizza gave it an interesting texture as you take the 1st bite. The pear was sweet, and the cheese had a slightly bitter taste. It was sort of like blue cheese.  The bf's Thai pizza was also unique. If you use the dip, it will be super spicy. Without it, it was somewhat plain. There was also a rewards membership that you can sign up for.

First of all, upon entering the building somehow I became the host because I first had to acknowledge the young lady before she acknowledged me, the guest. She then proceeded to, in a less than pleasant tone direct us to the bar because there ""weren't any tables"". Reluctantly we complied, not because we'd intended on sitting at the bar, but because we felt like we had no other choice. We get to the bar and order fairly quickly. The beverage I ordered, the strawberry mango cooler, which I've had before at the Dunwoody location tasted not like I remembered so i simply asked for a strawberry lemonade instead. Inconsistency in the dining experience is not what I expected. Next came our pizzas.  I explicitly ordered a cheese pizza, light cheese with extra sauce on the pizza and on the side. So out comes the pizza. Honestly this had to be the most poorly made pizza I've ever had at any California pizza kitchen location. No symmetry whatsoever, I had more crust than actual sauce, and I didn't get any sauce on the side. Okay,  sometimes people forget.  But when I reminded Seth about my extra side of sauce,  this gentleman proceeds to give me a nice COLD scoop of marinara sauce on a saucer. Not only did I touch the sauce and feel that it was ice cold, but I could clearly see Seth from my seat. WHY WOULD I WANT COLD SAUCE ON HOT PIZZA?? Seth seemed to find humor in that, obviously. At this point I am so over the entire thing and we ask for the check.

However, I was set on getting pizza and didn't want Papa John's or Sarpino's so I went to CPK. Upon entrance, I asked the hostess where the takeout was. After an annoyed sigh, she said ""Over there.. that way.. you see the sign.. in that corner."" As I walked towards to take out sign in the very back corner of the restaurant, I still heard her shouting directions at me as I was walking away. I was shocked! The host/ess is the first impression of a restaurant and for her to be so rude and have such a terrible attitude was appalling. I contemplated turning around and walking out of the restaurant due to the very unfriendly welcome. She was a brunette and I believe her name was Tez.  Luckily I was greeted in a very friendly and welcoming manner by the women at the Take-Out counter. One of their name badges said Alex and I couldn't remember the other's name but she had dreadlocks. They were very nice in stark comparison to the hostess and brought out the manager for me to speak with about my experience while I waited for my food. I shared my experience with the manager and all that she said to me was ""thank you for sharing."" That was it.. No apology, just thank you. She then proceeded to walk over to the hostess and presumably discuss her behavior towards me while I was still in the restaurant! To make matter worse, once I got home about 5 minutes later, my pizza was cold. The cheese tasted very low quality for a CPK and it was just not good.

I went to CPK with a friend of mine on a Friday night. Given the time and Day I went, I expected to be a huge crowd. There was a huge crowd and I had to put my name on the list to be called. We were initially told that wait time would be 10 minutes, however we were waiting for about 20 minutes. I was very disappointed I figure it would take them time to clear off the tables. Our waiter was very nice and professional. For an appetizer, I had the spinach artichoke dip  and the five cheese + tomato pizza. The only reason why this review lost a star was because the pizza wasn't as warm as I would have liked it. I still enjoyed coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20,2.84,3.17,3.17,,3.038
10,Ki R.,"Atlanta, GA",8,3,,5.0,2017-08-06,I had my daughter's 15th birthday dinner here. CPK's management and wait staff did everything to accommodate our large group. Everything ran smoothly even though we had separate checks. None of the checks were wrong!!! That was a big plus. Our entire party of nearly 30 had a great meal together. Thank you for helping to give my baby a special birthday!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20,3.0,3.17,3.17,,3.102
44,Desiree M.,"Suwanee, GA",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-25,"Mark and Chris (at the bar) made our experience absolutely amazing! They went above and beyond any expectation I ever thought about having. We placed a to go order and it was ready and right when I arrived. Our pizza was hot out of the oven! They gave us extra plates, napkins, silverware, etc to go with our order. They even invited us back after (or during) the concert in the park to have drinks. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed before we left. Really good food and amazing service. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=40,3.16,3.18,3.18,,3.1720000000000006
30,Vincent M.,"Atlanta, GA",68,49,232.0,3.0,2017-09-20,"So I was not as pleased with CPK as I expected to be compared to my experience with the one in Birmingham, AL.  My first experience I had their pasta.  On this visit I decided to do the barbecue pizza off the lunch menu.  You get a soup or a salad with your entree.  I chose the potato soup and to my surprise it was not bad.  You just have to add a little salt! Now I was not impressed with the pizza. My coworkers and I walked about a mile there so I was pretty hungry.  It was not satisfying taste wise. Plus it was barely warm. The crust is not good and it's very thin.  The sauce was okay, nothing special.  Maybe it's because it's lunch but I wasn't impressed overall with the pizza selection. Service was okay. Upon being seated the staff were huddled in the corner looking, so my coworkers and I waited to see how long it would take for someone to come to our table, which was about 6-7min. It was only 3 total in our party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2,3.2,3.19,3.19,,3.194
0,Mary W.,"Jonesboro, GA",26,145,120.0,3.0,2017-09-24,"It has been a very long time since I dined here. The restaurant is badly in need of some new chairs/tables. My tacos were more cabbage than fish and the fish was dry. The Thai Chicken spring rolls were served hot but gooey in the middle. Not exactly overwhelmed but the food. The service was great though. When using the restroom, the floor was a mess. Mentioned to the  server and it was promptly cared for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20,3.28,3.18,3.18,,3.2200000000000006
12,Deborah W.,"Sandy Springs, GA",8,55,8.0,3.0,2017-10-15,"Being a ex waitress I have high expectations for servers and expect my service to be A1 and that wasn't what we got. My friend had a birthday dinner party of 12 the wait took forever but when we were finally seated I guess the waitress was tired and ready to go because you can see it on her face she was throw down straws didn't speak to non of us I had to look up at her and say ""hello how are you doing today"" for her to even acknowledge us . She then walks away and didn't take our drink orders I had to tell her to order my drink. I know some of the people at our table was extremely loud but that don't have anything to do with her service. She finally took the rest of the drink orders after I got mine and I had to ask to put appetizers in so when she delivered them she didn't ask if we were ready to put in our entrees and half the table got their meal first. I wasn't pleased at all with her service but the food was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20,3.28,3.18,3.18,,3.2200000000000006
21,Kenyatta B.,"Savannah, GA",8,114,261.0,5.0,2017-10-17,"My boyfriend and friends decided to stop in for dinner before we headed out. Our party started with four people then it grew to five mid-way through the dinner. Our waiter Solomon immediately greeted us upon sitting and met everyone of our needs. We was personable and helpful throughout the entire experience. We ordered two shots, the sangria trio, a beer, the shrimp scampi pizza, and the California club. Our total came up to approximately 70 dollars, which, is a decent price for the amount of food and drinks we ordered. When the fifth member of our party came to the table, Solomon allowed us to pull up a seat and continue on with our dinner with no hesitations. Before we finished dinner we asked for additional bread and olive oil and every item we tried that night was delightful. This was an overall amazing experience. I hope the shrimp scampi pizza stays for a little while longer.  Overall the restaurant deserved an A. This is due to our awesome waiter, great food, family atmosphere, and decent wait time. Pitfalls, the pizza did take a little longer (this could be due to the large dinner crowd) and parking in this area may be confusing due to the numerous shops and eateries in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2,3.44,3.2,3.2,,3.2960000000000007

25,Cherise J.,"Atlanta, GA",130,189,72.0,4.0,2017-11-26,Sometimes sitting at the bar will yield faster and better service. It was very busy at CPK and we decided to sit at the bar. We were in and out in less than 1 hour. The wait for a regular table was at least 20 min. The soup was good and the sangria's were on point. The bartender hooked us up. I think I'll be sitting at the bar next time I go. The service was really good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2,3.56,3.21,3.21,,3.35
