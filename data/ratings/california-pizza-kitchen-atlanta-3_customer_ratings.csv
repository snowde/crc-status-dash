62,Ryan C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",31,138,30.0,3.0,2012-02-02,I wanted to not like this place just because its a chain. First time ever eating there and I actually like it. They have soome really good lemonade choices. My wife and I both ordered blackberry lemonade. Our server actually brought us mango lemonade a little later and because he said it was good and to try it. Service was excellent and the bbq pizza was pretty good. Other choices of pizza were just to much for my taste.

It was a Sunday evening, and T and I were famished after a LONG day at the mall. We literally couldn't leave the mall before eating SOMEthing. I was lightheaded and the whole 9 yards.  The only place open was CPK. I have never been to a CPK. I was slightly irritated but T loves this place, and well, I have no reason not to trust my husband's judgment! Our server was INCREDIBLY friendly and welcoming. I ordered the mango italian soda - OMG it was amazing. Not too sweet, was mango-y and just REFRESHING. And I got a refill and wasn't charged for it! (Free refills on fancy sodas!! Yay, chains!) We ordered the Barbeque Chicken Pizza - wow.  The crust was perfect, the pizza was bursting with flavor, had a ton of fresh veggies, and was very satisfying.

Even with it beng a ""half"" size, I still have leftovers to take home. My server Naomi was warm and pleasant, even with me being a table of one; host was also friendly and accomodating, not making it a big deal to give me a booth. One minor annoyance was they were conducting a survey wherein you sample their new pizza and fill out a critique in exchange for a gift card you can use towards your meal. I get it that a tab for one person doesn't meet the $ threshold, but they could at least acknowledge me and explain that when every table around me is being fawned over by the survey lady and tasting some new bbq pizza.  I mean, eating alone is always a little awkward...that kinda made it more so.

Had a few drinks at the bar in the mean time. Once we sat, we started off with some chicken lettuce cups. They were ok.. Definitely not anything special at all. I then ordered some grilled chicken with veggies and my gf ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. I had some of the pizza and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but definitely pretty good. My grilled chicken dish was very basic and didn't blow me away by any means.  We ordered some red velvet cake for desert and that's always a pleasure.

Prepared to be in for a bit of a wait for a table and then for your food - which is enjoyable - over the years I've had their pizzas, pastas, and salads and I've yet to find any fault with them - decent portion sizes, nice dish presentation, and overall - tasty. However, on my last visit, I decided to deviate from the norm and order one of their taco entrees: the ""Carnitas Tacos"" ($11.97 + $0.99 for avocado slices), which came with a side of salsa and black and white corn tortilla chips. Again, palatable, but incredibly overpriced for two tacos (TWO!) and a side of chips - I couldn't help but think of Buford Highway and the bounty of tacos $13 could allot.

My first time after the renovation was for an early dinner after shopping for a few hours. They did not have any available tables so we opted to sit at the bar since we were starving. We ordered light by sharing the CHICKEN CLUB PIZZA, which is my usual order at CPK. I love how they give complimentary slices of French Baguette and olive oil for dipping. We definitely helped ourselves by asking for more. The service was great near the beginning but was dwindling toward the end. Had to grab our server's attention several times. I think next time I would wait a bit and sit at a regular table. The bartender was both a server and making drinks at the same time.  My most recent visit was exceptional.

So I came to ATL from California, and ""yes"" I have had the pleasure of California Pizza Kitchen on the west coast, so can the east coast really do California Pizza the way Cali can?   I was shopping at Lenox and met a few friends there.  We were really working up an appetite running around this HUGE mall.  There are several choices in the mall proper to decide upon; however, we all agreed a martini lunch with salad was in order.  CPK it is! There was a little wait to be seated, but that was okay.  We grabbed cocktails from the bar and the time truly flew by as we planned out the rest of our shopping excursion.  The hostess called our name for the table and off we were.  The restaurant is beautifully designed, especially for a chain restaurant.  It overlooks much of the Lenox mall area and is totally open in design.  The employees looked happy to work in such an open atmosphere--shoot, I would like to work in an open environment like that too.  It was really modern, clean and fresh looking.  Everyone had smiles on their faces and cute shirts, easily identifiable. Once seated, our server greeted us with charm and knowledge about the menu.  There were several salad options, so we wanted to know what was her favorite--and why.  She never skipped a beat.  Informed us about the ingredients, the pairings, the most popular salad, etc.  She did not just describe salads to us, she brought out a couple of her favorites from each section of the menu.  The choices all sounded amazing--this is going to be harder than I originally thought. We decided to go ""family style"" so we could try a few items but not commit to anything: Bianco Flatbread Thai Crunch Salad Chicken Tequila  And lots of martinis... The flat bread was really delicious.  I think there were about three or four kinds of cheeses sprinkled on this thin bread along with fresh sage and truffle cream.  Really simple, yet really tasty.  Next came the salad.  It was absolutely HUGE.  There were rice sticks, fried won tons, a delicious mix of cabbage slaw, tons of veggies, peanuts, chicken, avocado and a stupendous dressing to tie it all together.  Finally, the pasta came out after the salad.  A massive plate of spinach fettuccine served with chicken, onions and peppers, cilantro and some little kick of heat in a creamy sauce.   Everything was yummy.  I think what I love about CPK is that they are super consistent no matter which location you visit.  That is always a plus in my book.   Stephani Smiles for CPK ;) #bringfriendsandshare",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.2840000000000003,3.76

Ordered an appetizer, the lettuce wrap, and got that shortly after. His name is Cameron.  Ordered drinks and it didn't come. Not even the water came.. isnt that the basic??  A glass of white wine and a corona. Didnt see our server for 20mins. So finally flagged him down and he said,"" what did you order?"" So he basically forgot. Had to even flag down another server to ask about our drinks.  Then another 20mins later we flag him down again. And he said that the bartender is busy making the drinks. Making a glass of wine and a beer? I saw a customer sit in front of me and they got their slushes and wine before I flagged him down the last time. He got in my bf face and we decided to leave. The server told us that drinks are ready but you can leave if you want. No apology. Nothing! Just an arrogant kid.  Just sucks because I have great memories here.  All i wanted was a glass of wine! Thats all.  Then the manager is too busy doing everyone elses job. Very poor management and the way you train your employees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

46,Daralynn L.,"Marietta, GA",56,198,33.0,5.0,2017-03-19,"My go to spot every time I'm at Lenox Square Mall. I took my nephew whom has always wanted to see Lenox Mall. I explained to him I'll take you to my restaurant for lunch ..as if I own it hehe I've always loved how it's situated in the mall above the food court. It's certainly draws your eyes to it. There is a waiting area as I walk in. We were seated quickly. Some things changed since my last visit. There was a station in the front with a tv and a place where the staff keeps your glasses filled with beverages.  Have never had any issues with the food or the location. The staff is always friendly . The tables are always clean and the food is always good. I guess I'm just lucky when I eat here as opposed to other reviews.  I will admit I play it safe and order the same thing each time. My favorite order is half caesar salad. It was far from being a half salad, but no complaints here. I ate the other half for breakfast. Also the Thai chicken pizza; with grilled chicken breast with peanut sauce topped with  bean sprouts,  carrots and slivered scallion. My nephew ordered a spicy chipotle chicken pizza. It was topped with chipotle adobo sauce,shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro and a  lime crema; which is a sauce on the side. He was too chicken  to try the sauce.  See you on the next review.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

I had their Waldorf Chicken Salad which was very good.  I would have to say that part of our group order 1/2 salads and the rest ordered full salads and they came out the exact same size.  Not sure if this is normal or not.   As for our server, he was a disaster.  We waited more than 10 minutes for him to bring the bread to our table - even though the restaurant was almost empty.  Once he took our orders he never came back to check on us.  We got no refills on any of our drinks - even the almost $3 ice tea.  We had to flag him down (took a while to find him) to get a bill.  We asked for to-go containers and a to-go salad dressing.  He brought the containers - with no bags - but no salad dressing.  As it had been 1 hr and 20 mins by then we just went ahead and left.

42,Tanesha A.,"Marietta, GA",40,95,160.0,4.0,2017-07-21,"Today was a good day at California Pizza Kitchen. Our server (Brooke, I think) was really nice. She remembered everyone's order and also remembered most of our names (sorry if I got yours wrong...my short-term memory is lacking).  Anyway, we were out celebrating July birthdays at work and the choice the bday boys made was CPK. Well, that wasn't my choice and I kept my mouth shut and went along for the free meal. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini...surprisingly this dish was good! I almost at the entire thing...which is not good and I believe I will spend the entire weekend running it off, but hey when it's good it's worth it.  The atmosphere was nice we had good conversation, the waitress came by and refilled drinks accordingly made sure everyone was comfortable and enjoyed their meals, had enough napkins...you name it, she did it!  We were full and just about comatose when we left but sure as my name is Tanesha I waddled right out of there with my food baby leading and back to work (after stopping at Sweet Hut).

For desert you gotta try the butter cake!! OMG its the best butter cake you'll have in your life. Way better than the butter cake sold at Hortons Steakhouse believe it or not. It just melts in your mouth. My mouth is watering just thinking about that cake. The staff is always nice and the restaurant is always super clean.

I have never been unhappy here and I've been here many many many times. It was nice to visit Atlanta again and come back and eat here for lunch.  The mall is a fun location for this too.

51,Andrew S.,"Duluth, GA",31,7,,3.0,2017-11-23,"Located inside one of Atlanta's most upscale mall, the Lenox Mall, there is a casual dining restaurant chain that specializes in California-style pizza. It is California Pizza Kitchen. The California Pizza Kitchen is known for its innovative and nontraditional pizzas. I have tried California Pizza Kitchen in my different locations statewide and I would have to say this location was one of the best and the worst experience ever. Since this location is inside the mall, it is loud as expected and would not be consider fine dining to me. Now for the Positive notes. The Server was very professional, gave us pointers on which we should order with good suggestions, very attentive, and customer service oriented. (Customer Service was on point for the Server) Now for the bad. The two hostess at the front was not friendly at all and had a dull face when was greeted. They had no customer service experience and showed that they did not want to be there. I had a pair of customer sitting right next to me at the bar, who was debating if they should steal the Wine glass that they were drinking out from and literally walked out with it. If the hostess were paying attention, this would of not happened at all. As a business owner I would definitely be worried. What if they walked out with Alcohol in it, what would have happen? Nevertheless, the food was great! I Suggest trying the Shrimp Scampi pizza, it is Housemade lemon-garlic shrimp with caramelized onions, Mozzarella, Parmesan and red chili, topped with fresh arugula and wild Greek oregano. I am only giving 3 stars because of the Server, Customer Service, and the Food.I will probably give this location an another Chance to Redeem themselves once again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

It's above the food court but below the main level of the mall where most of the stores are. We came here on a Sunday around 3pm and had a 10 minute wait which wasn't bad at all. Our waitress came promptly and took drink orders and then returned to take our order for food. I got the pepperoni pizza and my boyfriend got their Caesar salad. While you wait for your food, they bring out bread with olive oil to dip it in. The bread is warm and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside (yum!). Their pizzas are on the large size for one portion so two people could easily share one, but if you're very hungry or eat a lot, it might be worth it to order your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3,3.48,3.62,3.62,,3.5640000000000005
