39,Gill B.,"Atlanta, GA",88,155,26.0,3.0,2014-10-16,"My summary of my experience at the CPK at Perimeter: middle of the road chain restaurant, not so stellar customer service, lovely setting.  I came with a large group of ten co-workers for a little birthday lunch in the middle of the work week. It was not very crowded on this particular Wednesday afternoon - a few groups of two or three here and there spread throughout the spacious restaurant. I like the atmosphere of the bright, open dining room with lots of windows. We were seated at a long table in a little elevated dining area with booths lining the walls, and two giant flat screen TVs positioned above on the wall airing the NFL Network on both of them (which I certainly appreciated as an avid football fan!). There is also a little patio area outside that had about 5 or 6 tables. I arrived a little bit late to the gathering with one of my co-workers, and promptly asked for a water when I sat down. The server seemed a bit distracted and neglected to bring it while she refilled teas and brought out second sodas to the rest of the party. I politely inquired again, and she apologized. Very sweet! They had a little table tent promoting their signature cocktails including mojitos - my weakness! I had no idea that they offer such an array of fun cocktails. If I were to come in for dinner (and not with the work group), I could certainly be enticed to try these out (and perhaps I would bump my rating up a star or two). I ordered the chicken chimichurri, and was impressed when our orders came out in about 15 minutes. Well, most of them did. The servers promptly delivered the fresh looking salads and pizza plates to their rightful diners, but there seemed to be a bit of confusion on two of the pizza orders. One of them came out a good 15 minutes after everyone else's, leaving the forgotten party member to scarf down his pizza long after everyone else had finished. This was a bit frustrating on a not-so-busy Wednesday lunch break when we all felt a bit rushed to get back to the office for meetings and email inbox control. The food was decent. I thought that the sauce was a little spicy, but the chicken was a good texture and the veggies were cooked just right. Satisfactory meal. The place gets a passing grade, but I was by no means blown away.

I ordered the chicken chimichurri, and was impressed when our orders came out in about 15 minutes. Well, most of them did. The servers promptly delivered the fresh looking salads and pizza plates to their rightful diners, but there seemed to be a bit of confusion on two of the pizza orders. One of them came out a good 15 minutes after everyone else's, leaving the forgotten party member to scarf down his pizza long after everyone else had finished. This was a bit frustrating on a not-so-busy Wednesday lunch break when we all felt a bit rushed to get back to the office for meetings and email inbox control. The food was decent. I thought that the sauce was a little spicy, but the chicken was a good texture and the veggies were cooked just right. Satisfactory meal. The place gets a passing grade, but I was by no means blown away. There are so many great dining options in the Perimeter area, so this one can easily be overlooked.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.732,2.8

Getting here after lunch rush should free up time to make a great pizza. We were seated by a smiling face and the approached by another smiling face. My point here is that the service was fine nothing amazing but it was average.    Everyone on my table order and I went last only because nothing I read felt that I was worth the suggested price. When I got my pizza I was right about my hunch.

Today, however, I had the worst dining experience I have ever had in my entire life. I went with my sister and my girlfriend at around 4 pm. My girlfriend's family is from Vietnam as are many of her friends. As we were walking to our table, my girlfriend was greeted by a Vietnamese lady whom my girlfriend knew because this lady is my girlfriend's friend's aunt. I thought to myself, since this lady knew my girlfriend, she was gonna be very nice and friendly to us but she was completely rude and racist.  She came over to my table and completely disregarded my sister and I. She only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I did not even know she was asking what we would like to order because she literally only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I asked the lady, whose name I later found out to be Mrs Hong, what flavor sweet teas they had and she rudely opened the menu and wavered her hand across the drinks section. I finally found the flavors for the sweet tea and asked for a raspberry one. She then asked my sister what she would like and she said she was going to share a drink with me. Mrs Hong rudely said we could not share a drink and proceeded to ask my girlfriend in Vietnamese where we are from. My girlfriend responded from Ecuador and Mrs Hong said ""that's why"" in Vietnamese.  I immediately wanted a new server but did not want to put my girlfriend in an uncomfortable situation. However, Mrs Hong continued to give me bad looks and disregard my presence every time she came around.  Food arrived when my girlfriend was in the restroom. She was sitting inside which made it uncomfortable for the server to put the plate down, so I offered to help put the plate down and Mrs Hong yanked the plate and refused my help.  After that, I had had enough. I asked for another server and she said OK.  New server came around and I thought that was the end of her rudeness, but I was wrong. She came to my table once again and handed my girlfriend a check, once again speaking in Vietnamese. She had given my girlfriend her very own separate check and had given her check a 25% off. She never asked if she was paying by herself, we always get one check. By this time I was fed up, so I was asking my girlfriend what this lady was saying because I did not understand. My girlfriend later told me Mrs Hong was telling her to not tell me anything.  That was the worst customer service I had ever experienced in my entire life. I asked Mrs Hong to call a manager. I was extremely angry at her rudeness, racism, and just lack of customer service to the point where I started crying. I had never before cried in a restaurant, I barely ever cry but that's how angry I was. I would not have cared if she had been all of that behind my back, but if you work in customer service, you have to fake niceness if you do not have a nice attitude. I have worked in restaurants, I've dealt with customers for about four years, I was a manager and customers have been horrible but never not even once have I acted the way this lady acted.  The manager was very apologetic and tried to make our visit right but there was nothing he could do. He took care of our order but we could not even finish our food out of anger. My sister was crying, my girlfriend was about to cry, and I could not help it but cry out of anger.  I am most likely never going back to this location and my advice to you is to ask for another server if you ever get Mrs Hong because my girlfriend told what happened to her friend and she explained that Mrs Hong is known for being racist.

My wife and I had pasta bolognese and pepperoni pizza.  Everything tasted good.  The service was quite good.  The atmosphere was nice, though unfortunately there were a couple kids yelling through much of our meal behind us--not that that is the restaurant's fault, but is a shame that that happened.  The taste of the pizza is as good as I could ask for.  One small drawback is that the crust was a little hard (for my taste), particularly on the end of a piece.  All in all, though, the food is quite good and this place is worth going back to. As for the red velvet cake, we ordered it as takeout and had it later.  We liked it a lot.  It was not too ""cheesy"" because of the good texture of the vanilla ""whipped cream"" cheese icing.  The cake was moist and sweet, and it is one of the best red velvet cakes we have had.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta,2.96,3.12,3.12,3.3440000000000003,3.0560000000000005

Shrimp Scampi Zucchini - had more zucchini ribbons than fettuccine, when they say a touch of fettuccine, it is literally just that.  It tasted ok, the garlic flavour came through but it was still a bit bland.  Quantity was more than enough and I had to pack it up as I couldn't finish it.  I ended up putting chilli sauce and a home-made spicy gravy on it - wish I had that before, it was amazing lol.  The mix of the lemon garlic and spicy gravy was so good, will definitely try making it at home some time. Spicy Chipotle Pizza - I tried this without the adobo sauce, which is apparently what makes it spicy.  The pizza on its own is mild and honestly a bit weird with the corn on it.  I wasn't a fan, it's a bit of a funny mix.  The base was nice though and I liked the pizza crust - if that counts.

My wife and I had pasta bolognese and pepperoni pizza.  Everything tasted good.  The service was quite good.  The atmosphere was nice, though unfortunately there were a couple kids yelling through much of our meal behind us--not that that is the restaurant's fault, but is a shame that that happened.  The taste of the pizza is as good as I could ask for.  One small drawback is that the crust was a little hard (for my taste), particularly on the end of a piece.  All in all, though, the food is quite good and this place is worth going back to. As for the red velvet cake, we ordered it as takeout and had it later.  We liked it a lot.  It was not too ""cheesy"" because of the good texture of the vanilla ""whipped cream"" cheese icing.  The cake was moist and sweet, and it is one of the best red velvet cakes we have had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta,3.76,3.37,3.37,,3.5260000000000002
