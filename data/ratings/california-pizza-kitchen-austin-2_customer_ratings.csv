82,Karol M.,"Austin, TX",343,413,575.0,3.0,2012-03-20,"This is the storefront for the corresponding yellow pizza boxes in my grocer's freezer.  It's a bright and cheery-looking place, and I love all things California (except crowds and high prices), so I was expecting something fairly interesting. What I wasn't expecting was to stand around quite so long for a table.  The place was crowded with a wait on a weekend afternoon, mostly with families with young children.  My group was seated by a trendy, slumpy young woman who mumbled something unintelligible as she set down our menus (no silverware or drinks, either), and we waited around some more for our server to finally show up, and even longer for food and silverware (in that order, and we had to hunt her down and actually ask her to bring napkins and forks while our food sat there waiting patiently...more patiently than we were, by this point.) In a pizza kitchen, naturally you'd want to order the pizza, and naturally you'd expect to share it.  With the prices especially, you'd think that a 10"" pizza would feed at least two people.  Our server informed us with disdain that we weren't ordering enough food, that she regularly ate one by herself.  She must have weighed all of 100 lbs, so I thought maybe she just burned off all those calories.  We ordered a 10"" pizza for every two people, and side salads off the appetizer menu.  I didn't see any larger pizzas offered. Turns out, she was right.  Their 10"" pizzas are thin, and our toppings were partially burned, so we ended up picking some of them off.  The salads were tasty but also small.  We were still hungry at the end of our meal, but it was so loud in there and the service took so long, that we just wanted to exit and move on with our day. From the look of the menu and the stylish interior, the dining experience here should be better than it was.  But for now, I'll stick with an occasional yellow California pizza box from the freezer section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9880000000000004,3.3200000000000003
177,Rose K.,"Austin, TX",2,14,,1.0,2012-04-09,"Sometimes I'm at The Domain and I want to grab something to eat that isn't too fancy, too expensive, or too uppity.  Despite it's casual air, it's a bit pricey and the service is consistently downright terrible. We've eaten there about 24 times over the years and we've yet to have a single instance of consistently decent service.  The waitstaff are not even remotely prompt in checking in with you when you first arrive and once you place your order, good luck on it arriving quickly or having your waitperson check on you for any reason. The food ranges from tasty to nasty. We've found that if we stick to certain items, we get what we're expecting (i.e., their sandwiches tend to be good along with their side salads, but beware the croutons...stale yuckiness!). The final straw for us came when I was having a bad week and decided to splurge on getting a pecan praline cheesecake that was on special.  I couldn't stuff it down while at the restaurant, so I got it to go.  Later that day, I busted that baby out and with great anticipation dug into it for my first bite. Oh dear God, was that ever horrible. It had a salty, vinegary taste that overrode the sweetness of the cheesecake.  Because I was in denial, I actually ate three bites before I took a deep whiff of it's aroma and recognized the odor.  It wasn't a lovely praline sauce on top of the cheesecake, but instead, was the asian potsticker dipping sauce.  You may have a hard time imagining the sheer nastiness of the co-mingling of flavors, but please believe me, it is one of the most horrible things I've ever eaten in my life.

I had never been there, and I had no idea what it was - except for having a pretty good hunch that they served pizza.  The service was not very good. I sat with an empty glass of water most of the time I was there. I even resorted to slurping the last of the ice out of the glass, which brought looks from the folks behind the counter/bar, but still no water. Granted, we stayed and visited for quite a while, but they were NOT busy, so what difference did that make? Does my meal come with an allotted time limit? And there must have been a shift change somewhere along the way, because our waitress left, and we were consequently completely ignored for the rest of the visit.  It was not like we just came in and ordered a drink and gabbed for hours. We all ordered meals, and the bill was not cheap. The food did not impress me. It was okay, but had a very 'chain restaurant' out of a freezer quality to it. I thought it was way overpriced from a price-to-quality ratio standpoint. Of course, being in the Domain, one expects high prices, but then again, with high prices should come good service.

Other members of my party had difficulties with their pizzas as well and weren't satisfied either with their orders. I will say that the Fish Tacos were good with the addition of Avocado though Service was lacking as we asked for items like water and extra sauce on the side multiple times throughout our meal and the wait time was longer than expected.

Their BBQ Chicken pizza is the best!!! I love the tangy BBQ sauce combined with the chicken, and if you get the Hawaiian version the pineapple just adds that extra blast of sweetness! The California club looks like they just dumped a salad on your pizza but it is actually pretty good! It has lettuce, avocado, and pieces of chicken and bacon on top! They also used to have a veggie pizza with eggplant which I don't know if they still have, and it is a great choice for all you veggie lovers.  As for the pastas, my go-to is the Pesto Penne! It is absolutely delicious with the sun-dried tomatoes and shrimp! I have also had the Cajun pasta and it is good as well for those of you who are craving something a little spicy.  For the salads, I love the pear Gorgonzola one, but I don't know if they still have it on the menu cuz I haven't ordered it in a while. The caramelized peach one is also good!  I wouldn't recommend getting any appetizers because I feel that they are overpriced and not worth it.

More than 10 min later, my food finally arrived. I ate half of it but then my daughter woke up and wanted to be held. The waiter returned and asked how it was. I said good. He said worth the wait? I said no (honestly). At no point did a manager approach me. I expected waiter to tell a manager about the issues and i definitely think my food should have been comped. I even told the waiter that the people next to me had arrived 15 min after I ordered and they still got their food before I did. He seemed annoyed and said ...

If you're not up to paying ~$20, get a pizza and share with another friend and split the cost. This place is called ""California Pizza Kitchen"" so maybe that was a better choice. Atmosphere: It feels really casual and clean in here and I felt super at comfort. I walked in and felt like I could stay for a long time without feeling like I had to leave as soon as possible. It was pretty quiet and welcoming. Service: Our waiter was actually very kind and did all he can to communicate with us. He did seem busy even with the restaurant being really empty.  Time: The food took way to long to make its way to the table. I came in a group of 6 (including myself)- which really isn't too big of a group. But I feel like after we put our orders in, we were sort of forgotten. Even the bread they normally bring out took a long time. Food: The bread came out warm and it was crispier on its sides. We had to ask for another side of the bread because they only brought one dish to our table when we had 6 people. I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine which was pretty good initially/ at first bites. Later it got really really salty and I drank multiple cups of water. There was a lot less chicken pieces than I imagined and the serving size wasn't as big as I thought. For the price, it was alright (not a problem, but not an absolute wow either).

Also their mango tea is a must, so order that instead of your regular sodas or water.

No rush at all, passed the lunch rush and not quite dinner time yet. So the restaurant was not busy at all. There were at least 6 people I saw scurrying around and only our booth and a lady at the bar (who arrived after us). We walked in. Got seated and we waited...and waited. We didn't even get our menus for a very long time. I had to raise my hand and wave it in the air like I was back in elementary school waiting my turn to be called on by the teacher. Let me add, this trend did not stop.  I was finally able to hail someone down to ask for the menus. The waitress took our drink order but I guess she misheard me; gave me lemon with my water when I explicitly said, no lemon. We were given bread...which was pretty stale. It was so tough it could chip a tooth. Was able to hail someone down again to take our order.  They were kind enough to give us a complimentary white corn guac and chips for it being our first time there (probably an apology for the terrible beginning service, but I don't know). The corn was good; sweet, but it was not a ""dip"" or ""guac"" in any way. It just had chunks of avocado, a lot of white corn, and some chunks of chile. It was more like a topping than a dip. Difficult to scoop and eat. Wasn't super special. Just eating corn and corn chips.  Shrimp scampi zucchini By description this would've been something I should love. Love white wine sauce. Love zucchini. Love shrimp. It was terribly executed though. The wine caused the zucchini to pickle and it became really really sour. The zucchini was inedible. There was a decent amount of shrimp, I give that, but the star of the dish was the zucchini so 3/4th of the dish was trashed.  We asked for more bread and she stated that they are currently making more and that the first one we got was the last one (no wonder it was stale).  We told the waitress that we were in a rush and she still took forever with everything she did. I don't understand why an empty restaurant with multiple employees can't work together to serve the two parties in the building.  Took forever to give us the check and a to go box. Overall, the food I got was terrible. I give them the benefit of the doubt that it is a pizza place and that's what you should order. The pizza looked good so my advice is go for the pizza not the pasta.

6,Tanya G.,"Austin, TX",50,6,5.0,1.0,2017-11-29,"In August I held a fundraiser at California Pizza Kitchen under the pretext that a percentage of meals would be donated back to my non profit.  During the event there were many displays of ""hospitality"", and ""customer service"" so I wrote reviews, positive emails etc. Boy was I fooled! It's now 2 days from December and all the promises are faded, I've had to beg for follow through, and now, apparently no one is responding anymore AND, still no payment for our fundraiser. How is this OK? How is it legal? Can't believe a business operates this way. My non profit has received grants and other funding for much higher amounts, way less drama and frustration, and full follow through. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,2.8,3.13,3.13,,2.9979999999999998
41,Edward P.,"Leander, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-01,"The Thai Chicken and Chipotle Chicken were both good and those are the only positives. They don't have a happy hour and the drinks are ridiculously priced. The service was bad. I think we waited 30 minutes before getting to order, 40 min before getting bread. Once we ordered everything went smoothly, food was ok. When I paid my bill I was watching them having issues with my Credit Card, they came brought me my bill and did not mention that anything was wrong with the transaction. I just assumed they were having issues swiping my card because it does that sometimes. But the next day I have two charges on my Card from California Pizza. Once for almost twice the original amount. I understand accidents happen but they could have told me. It appeared the waiter called on for help from a man with normal clothes on. I assumed a manager of some sort. This person should have came and apologized for charging my card twice. Then all would be well on my side because accidents happen. So this was a horrible trip, doubt I'd ever eat there again. But I have been a few other times and have not had this bad of an experience. Food is usually ok, hard to mess up pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=20,2.8,3.12,3.12,,2.9920000000000004
3,Sarah L.,"Austin, TX",242,74,207.0,2.0,2017-12-07,"I knew this was a chain, so i thought cpk would be quick and an inexpensive meal. But CPK is overpriced pizza and I happenedd to order the cpk club which included avocado, shredded lettuce, and bacon. The pizza was your average one but I think the thing i regret the most is that this pizza was something i could clearly make at home if I had chosen to do so. Not only was the pizza very bland and not special but it was a whopping $16! Def would not recommend when there are other places nearby",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,2.72,3.11,3.11,,2.9539999999999997
5,Kanika B.,"West Campus, Austin, TX",283,27,98.0,4.0,2017-12-12,Came here during lunch for the first time and got to try their lunch duo! I got the Chicken Meatball Piadina and Sedona Tortilla Soup. It was about $10 and you really can't beat the price. You get half a piadina and a smaller bowl of soup. The food was good and the waiter was kind. The restaurant wasn't packed either. I feel like I've been missing out by only coming for dinner. Will be back for lunch again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,2.72,3.11,3.11,,2.9539999999999997
1,Sandra S.,"Austin, TX",146,159,877.0,2.0,2017-12-30,"What a disappointing visit from start to finish :/ Our uninterested hostess sat us at a table right under an ac vent so we never took off our coats.  We mentioned it to the waiter and he simply said oh i didn't notice.  I asked for a sample of sauvignon blanc and the bf wanted some hot tea.  The waiter came back and said they were out of the label i asked for and brought teas for bf to choose from.  I ordered a different wine and bf picked his tea.  We ordered our pizza and salad and asked for no sausage since i don't like it.  No problem.  After more than enough time i got my glass of wine and our waiter comes back with a cup with a rather large cup on the rim and says all their mugs are dirty so would he mind using the mug with the chip on the rim.  If not,  he says he could hand wash a mug for him.  REALLY? ?????????? THAT MUG BELONGED IN THE TRASH!!!  Why would they even offer that as an option? ??? So BF says that's ok I'll just have water.   We get our salad pizza and bread ALL at the same time,  what's the point of bringing bread if it comes at the same time as the pizza? Oh and BTW they sure did put the sausage on the pizza that we asked to take off. Ugh. After we started eating the waiter comes after we're about on our second piece and says how's everything?  Can we get some parmesan and also we asked for no sausage.  Oh sorry!   What a terrible experience.  It feels like what used to be a borderline upscale restaurant has turned into a second rate cutting corners place. I've been to this location and others in San Antonio and Vegas and never experienced anything like this.  Not feeling it,  probably not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,2.72,3.12,3.12,,2.9600000000000004
0,Paul P.,"Round Rock, TX",47,33,71.0,4.0,2018-01-01,"We have eaten at this little restaurant several times when we go to the Domaine and I decided it was time to make the time for a review. We were disappointed that they have removed hummus from the menu, but their delicious bread and olive oil quickly made us forget about it. We substituted or normal request fro hummus for their Tortilla Spring Rolls for an appetizer. We chose the Mediterranean nd Baja Chicken. Both were good, but I'll pass next time on the marinara sauce that comes with them. The guacamole that accompanied them was very fresh and delicious. I had Sicilian pizza and I really liked the thin crust. The Italian sausage was very good as well as the other meats and ingredients. We enjoyed a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir and Mark West Pinot Noir with our meal. We will keep going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,2.84,3.12,3.12,,3.0080000000000005
2,Danni M.,"Granbury, TX",227,6,3.0,5.0,2018-01-05,Employees are so sweet. I didnt dine in but i got a Togo order. Everyone approached me to check on me. I'm not sure if it's suppose to be team service but i enjoyed being acknowledged by everyone for the 15 minutes i was there. 15 minutes includes me being indecisive and them getting my pizza out. Also. Best pizza. Hands down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2,3.0,3.13,3.13,,3.078
