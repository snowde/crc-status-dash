24,Roxy W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",155,444,1400.0,4.0,2012-03-04,"I always enjoy coming to CPK! CPK is very popular in Hawaii and I always come back because of their consistency, ambiance and reasonably priced entrees. This is the first time coming to this location and it looks like all the other CPK I've been to. My go to meal is the chicken salad sandwich on cheese focaccia bread with Caesar salad. I always get this entree because the price is great at $11 for a large sized sandwich and salad at a sit down restaurant. I usually eat half of my sandwich and safe the other half for later because it's a very filling sandwich. I use to get their Rosemary chicken sandwich but it has been discounted for a few years now. That was a better sandwich than the chicken salad sandwich.  There full sized salads and pizzas are delicious. I also enjoyed the fruity alcoholic drinks that were offered in Hawaii. I'm not sure if they offer a wide selection of fruity alcoholic drinks at this location. I have ordered pasta in the past and I would not recommend the pasta. The serving size is small, taste like crap and it cost extra if you want to add on meat in their pasta dishes averaging the cost of the pasta to around $15.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.576,2.76

49,Christine A.,"Austin, TX",861,1069,1201.0,4.0,2012-11-05,"You have traveled by camel a very long distance to the mysterious country of Morocco on the coast of Northern Africa in search of a special Sultan. After much searching, you find his tent and enter to the music of a buzuq, a long-necked fretted lute with metal strings and a carved sound-box. The Sultan, a mysterious handsome man, asks you to sit, enjoy the music and partake of a strong, sweet wine and his antique hookah.  After some time, he beckons you to join him on a pile of silky pillows.   Later, as the sun sets below the sandy desert horizon, the Sultan claps his hands and beautiful servant girls bring trays of delicious food and place them before you. You reject everything. Except one dish. A Moroccan Chicken Salad. The Sultan is not offended as he is a man of amicable disposition. He whispers that it is his favorite dish, too, and reaches over, kisses the palm of your hand and smiles.  You begin to eat out of a handcrafted ceramic bowl filled with moroccan-spiced chicken, romaine, roasted butternut squash, sweet dates, cubes of avocado, bleu cheese, toasted almonds, beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and bell peppers. This rich concoction is tossed with a homemade champagne vinaigrette.  You are not one to give your heart away quickly but you have never experienced such an amazing salad.  You decide to become the Sultan's wife, have his 10 babies, smoke his hookah, ride camels and live in the desert so you can spend the rest of your life dining on the Moroccan Chicken Salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.8000000000000003,2.56

I was nervous about ""another chain pizza"" place, but it was Veteran's Day, and being one, my husband and I both got a free pizza for Vets Day. What is there to lose with a couple of free pizzas? We tried the Chipotle Chicken Pizza and the California Club Pizza. Both were delicious! I was quite surprised. The Chipotle Pizza had this great corn salsa that topped it that gave a great spice to it. And the Cali Club Pizza was creamy with a slice of avocado on each pizza slice. I liked the crust, it was a hand-tossed without being to bready or filling. On top of the free pizzas and drinks, the manager also gave us each a coupon for another free pizza. Four free pizzas??? YES please! The wait staff were all very attentive and pleasant, even though we were getting a bunch of free food so we tipped well and noted we will definitely be back, many times. The manager himself came out to shake our hands and thank us for our service. That was very nice! Thanks guys! And thanks for honoring vets in a city not always so military friendly!

They have a wide variety of types of dishes and flavor combos. I tried the white pizza and the thai chicken pizza. Definitely a sharable size, the white pizza was very good, and the thai chicken was not exactly what I had expected. But, nonetheless nice and crunchy with all those veggies.  Then, the pastas, tried the kung pao and the spaghetti bolognese. The kung pao was out of this world, the spaghetti bolognese...was ok. Both dishes were served definitely to be shared. The dessert, probably, the most enjoyable part of the meal (Im a big fan of sweets :) ) I loved their a la mode brownie dessert, and the tiramisu was so creamy/fluffy, very nice. though the expresso was a tad too much. The manager and the server were extremely nice to us. We went in for veteran's day and got some free meal cards to go back.

21,Winthrop J. Q.,"San Marcos, TX",8,29,,4.0,2013-01-06,"I noticed a few of the reviews here were for the location in the Domain (north Austin) so let me establish at the outset this is for the location in Barton Creek Square Mall. I wanted to eat here from the first time I saw it, since I have eaten their line of frozen pizzas, because I was curious.  I always want to compare how the food in an actual restaurant compares to any grocery store marketed entrees I have sampled on occasion.  Some places have disappointed me, some have been real gems..  This place was one of the latter. I admit it wasn't a real auspicious beginning, because I had a wait time of about 15-20 minutes, but this was Saturday afternoon, and it was inside a popular mall, so i can afford to be a little overlooking on that point.  Got a table, and my wait after that was minimal on all accounts.  Immediately got an acknowlegement and drink from my server, Jamie, and he actually took a little time to recommend a few items and answer questions, despite the crowd.  I ordered a pizza margherita, since that is my favorite of their grocery line.  Fresh crust goes a long way to compare with frozen pizza crusts.  This stuff was T-H-I-N.  I like thin crust, but even I was impressed as to how thin it could actually be made.  It was good, maybe could have used a bit of garlic for my tastes, but otherwise it was good.  Topped it off with a dessert that caught my eye (because there was a picture of it on my table!) Salted Caramel Pudding.  It was great.  Overall a very good experience except for the wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.6399999999999997,2.8

What is the big deal about this place? However, our server was friendly and didn't hover, my two favorite things in a waitress.

52,Lily W.,"San Diego, CA",190,222,112.0,3.0,2014-02-18,"Once upon a time I was an angsty 14 year old who had never had CPK.... then one day, while wandering my former kingdom of Somerset Mall, my friends and I decided to try it and a lukewarm relationship began. CPK is one of those chain restaurants that I occasionally get cravings for and actually like. It's usually pretty decent food but I've never had my socks blown off. My favorite dish there actually isn't a pizza; it's the shrimp lettuce wraps. I'm a big fan of lettuce wraps in general but, as always, shrimp trumps chicken any day of the week.  When I was in college, CPK was one of the few restaurants in our nearby Briarwood mall. Consequently it began a popular place for students with cars to go eat. I've tried many an odd pizza at that CPK including their ill-advised creation: The Peking Duck Pizza. Yes, CPK once had a Peking Duck Pizza; there's a reason that hot mess isn't on the menu anymore.  I dropped by this location with a friend for our regular Friday lunch date and I was not blown away. Service has been slow the few times I've been here and this visit was no exception. It took forever for someone to take our drink orders and even longer to get our food orders. In addition the lettuce wraps came out literally 2 minutes before our pizzas did. That kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer.  I ordered my usual pick: the Habanero Carnitas and he ordered the California Club. They both tasted normal along with the lettuce wraps. It definitely wasn't my best or worst experience at a CPK (there was an occasion when a server misplaced my order and brought out chicken lettuce wraps and INSISTED they were shrimp. I actually made one in front of her, took a bite, dropped the wrap back on my plate, and responded ""No, they're CHICKEN!""). I don't know of any other nearby CPKs so I guess I'm kind of left with this one.... slow service and all. Oh well, luckily I don't get shrimp lettuce wrap cravings too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.732,2.56

It was so special to watch my Little light up at the experience, a rarity for her.

I gotta say, maybe because it was close to closing time (not an excuse), the frozen is better. You'd think it was an hour old, considering the temperature, even though it ended up in front of me only 24 minutes after hitting the order button.  It just didn't seemed cooked all the way, as if it was rushed.  I'll throw it in the oven tomorrow and see if it's any better. I won't waste my time dealing with this place again, though.

We ordered the Jamaican jerk pizza and there was something off about it. It was bland and didn't taste as fresh. Our waitress was friendly and nice though. The reason why I'm also rating this establishment a one star is I had left an expensive scarf (cream colored with floral designs) and called and spoke to the host that night. She had told me she had found it after I had left and would hold onto it at the front. I wasn't able to get it the next day because I was out of town but came yesterday (Monday) and they didn't have it.  I spoke to the manager and she said she would contact me after talking with the host who was there Friday evening. I called today because I did not hear back and was told the host found my scarf and had it but had ""no idea what happened between Friday evening to Monday and it must have been misplaced or something."" She did apologize but I'm still a bit baffled as to what happened and how they could have lost an item they retrieved. From what I could tell, they had cabinets behind the host stand where they store items and it appears only employees can access and open it. Where else could it have gone?!  I hope that they can take better care of their customers belongings and return it to the respected owner.

We ordered an appetizer and our salads and our salads came out first and we didn't think anything of it.  Then our entree came out that we ordered to share on the same plate when we asked to have it split and still no appetizer.  Our server noticed the problem of the non-split entree right away and took it away for the kitchen to correct it.  Then we told her we never got the appetizer and she asked the kitchen and came back and said it would be right out.  The expo guy (maybe manager) brought out our now split and separately plated entree and apologized.  No big deal and I appreciated him bringing it out and apologizing.  Our appetizer finally came out about 5 minutes later but, of course we were way too full to have more than one piece each.  They did comp it however, for the issue. Avocado Club Egg Rolls:  Very interesting in texture and flavor but, I did enjoy it overall.  The inside filling was hot but, not mooshy and I find that combo hard to achieve with avocado in the filing.  The sauce was five stars all the way. California Cobb (Half order with beets):  Their blue cheese dressing is out of this word delish.  The freshness of this salad can't be beat and it was so large that this could have probably been a meal in itself.  I will definitely come back for this. Kung Pao Spaghetti:  I actually didn't know what to expect since this is Asian/Italian fusion cuisine and who has ever really heard of that?  The peanuts and red chili are Asian so they worked well together but, the surprise came with them tasting oh my delicious on pasta with garlic.  Well done, well done. It took us waving down our server to be able to get some boxes and check out.  The overall service wasn't bad but slow and with the hiccups in steps of service to our food coming out; that's why I gave it a 4 and not a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

I felt conflicted about making a stop at this spot since I am from California and CPK is abundant where I'm from - not to mention I've been there way too many times...  ... but I needed something light, and this was as close as it's gonna get.

The past couple months I've noticed they changed the packaging of the salad and it's at least 2/3 smaller than the previous packaging. I never said anything but tonight I ordered the same salad and it seems even smaller, only slightly larger than a side salad...for $16. I posted a picture of the $16 salad too. I also ordered a cup of potato soup and the container was 2/3 full, so it was about 5 bites for $4.79.

Is there a bunch of tiny people I can't see sat at all the empty, clean tables? Anyway, we sat at the bar. We split the mac and cheese bites to start which were ok. They tasted like they had been defrosted though. We then split the garlic chicken pizza which they claim to be a favorite/specialty. Huge mistake on our part not realizing it was a white pizza which we don't like nearly as much as a ""normal"" pizza with tomato sauce. They had tried to be too fancy with their menu and didn't have that many traditional pizzas which we would have preferred anyway. I know that the pizza was at least cooked to order as we were sat right in front of the huge pizza oven, but it in no way tasted hot and fresh out of the oven. It was warm, not hot and felt like it was at least a day old and reheated. Perhaps the dough/base was, either way, it wasn't good and between us we couldn't finish 1 pizza and both felt a little sick for a couple of hours afterward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

She didn't pay much attention to us, except to take our order and deliver it. My wife doesn't eat much, so after her first slice of pizza, she asked for a box.  Waitress brought another table their order, too another table's drink order, made it, took their food order, then took another table's order. As she was checking on us, I tried her we were still waiting for a box.   Meanwhile, I found someone else's pasta in my dish. Checked my daughter's pasta and she also had someone else's pasta in her dish.  By that time, I. Was. DONE!!!!!    But we still had to wait for a box and the check.  I may give another California Pizza Kitchen a try, but I won't go back here.  If this is their standard customer service, I'm amazed they are still in business.  Now for the food.  My wife's pizza had no sauce.  My pasta was bland and my daughter's pasta tasted badly.   IF, and it's a very big if, I do try another CPK, if the did is this bad, I will never go back to any of them.   Seriously, how is this place in business?!?!?  Do people really like bad customer service and blah food?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
