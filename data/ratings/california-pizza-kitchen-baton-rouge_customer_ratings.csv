I struggled when I had to decide what star rating to give CPK (I would really want to give them a 3.5), as I have had really good and less than ideal experiences. I went yesterday with a friend, and did not have a great time.  I ordered the focaccia bread as an appetizer. Honestly, it tasted ok, but it was just warm, not hot. I liked the flavor, and I will always eat as much fresh bread as I can, though it did strike me as odd that they charge for bread here.  I had a hard time deciding what I wanted for my main course, but I chose the Garlic Cream Fettuccine and paid the $3 to add chicken. This is where things got weird. My pasta came with about 4 bites of chicken on it, and there was barely any sauce (not even all of my noodles had sauce on them). When the waitress came to check on me, I let her know that there was not nearly enough chicken or sauce. She apologized then brought me a bowl of sauce with more chicken in it. I am sure it was just a rare mistake from the kitchen, and after adding the chicken and sauce to my plate, I felt much better, and really enjoyed the rest my dinner.  My waitress let the manager know about my complaint, so she came over to talk to me. She explained that they only add 2.5oz of chicken when they add chicken to the pasta, and their dishes do not have a lot of sauce on them. I explained that I understood that they do not put a lot of chicken, but what I was initially served was not nearly worth the $3 I was paying to have it added to my dinner. She then gave me a card worth a free small plate when I go in again. On a side note, I used to work for Big Buddy here in town, and CPK hosted a tour for the Little Buddies and even fed them lunch, so I definitely want to recognize them for that.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-baton-rouge?start=40,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

We were seated next to a family whose child obviously did not enjoy the chicken he had as he threw half of it on the ground, a nice surprise when you step on a piece.

So kudos to her for checking because other places in town have just let the oversight go. The glass of wine i ordered, as expected, cost $1 less than I could usually buy it at the store, but that's very much expected.

Imagine a mini club sandwich wrapped in a wonton then deep fried. Also, the ranch sauce did not taste like the bottled stuff in supermarkets.  BBQ Chicken Pizza with Pineapple - Yes, there were not a ton of meat and sauce on top, but the topping's flavors and texture of the crust were spot on. Would order this again in the future. Thai Pizza - Honestly, this was just ok... Growing up eating a lot of Thai food, I felt it really lacked something to call it ""Thai.""

21,Shan E.,"Baton Rouge, LA",23,72,47.0,2.0,2017-10-13,"So my coworkers and I went to CPK for lunch. Let's just say this is not a place to eat at if you have a designated lunch time. There was no one at the hostess stand when we entered but when they came, we were seated immediately. The waitress came and took drink orders.  When she came back she dropped the drinks off and left swiftly. Considering we were on lunch, we were ready to order. I made contact with her and she came to the table and said she had to bring another table their card back before she could take our order. On the way back she stopped at 2 other tables.  She came and we ordered our lunches. My coworker kindly said ""we are in lunch"" she replied ""I understand but I'm busy too""  Someone else joined the party.

The square in Perkins rowe is all lighted up and beautiful with the fountain, so it makes for a great date night. The menu has a good selection of pizzas, pasta and flat breads. They have a really good potato soup as well. I love the garlic cream fettuccine alfredo. It's very creamy and good. As far as pizza goes, I usually get the meat cravers pizza. One pizza is plenty to split between two people.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-baton-rouge,2.32,2.87,2.87,,2.6500000000000004

79,Shawn C.,"Baton Rouge, United States",160,21,61.0,1.0,2017-11-11,Slow day today everyone in Baton Rouge at LSU game do I decided to stop by and get my veterans meal on lunch break. I was seated as soon as I walked up. Now it's been 10 min and I haven't had anyone come take my order. I don't know how to rate this. But I feel neglected because a party of four women walked in and they were served right away. I hope it's not because I am well darker complexion. Guess I am moving to the next restaurant. Won't be coming here again.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-baton-rouge,2.36,2.82,2.82,,2.636

20,Minh K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",130,120,441.0,4.0,2017-12-06,"A friend and I stopped here for dinner the other night and everything was surprisingly good. We were kinda hesitant eating here after seeing some really negative reviews, but are glad we went anyway. We were greeted and sat promptly. Our server greeted us within a few minutes too.  He was nice, attentive, and quick with drink refills/table clearing. Foodwise, we tried the: Avocado Ranch Egg Rolls - These were soo good. Imagine a mini club sandwich wrapped in a wonton then deep fried. Also, the ranch sauce did not taste like the bottled stuff in supermarkets.  BBQ Chicken Pizza with Pineapple - Yes, there were not a ton of meat and sauce on top, but the topping's flavors and texture of the crust were spot on. Would order this again in the future. Thai Pizza - Honestly, this was just ok... Growing up eating a lot of Thai food, I felt it really lacked something to call it ""Thai.""  Two managers(Dorothy and Ryan) also stopped by and made sure everything was fine. They were both really nice and knowledgeable about the menu. They recommended a Butter Cake dessert, but we were way too full. Overall, I think we would be back if we're in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-baton-rouge,2.4,2.8,2.8,,2.64
