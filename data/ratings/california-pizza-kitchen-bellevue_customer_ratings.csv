88,Tom J.,"Everett, WA",0,8,,1.0,2012-02-02,"I'm not sure why everyone seems to like this restaurant.  Other than I used to...  Last Saturday night my family and I decided to go because we knew we could get some good food for dinner.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!! Here is my list of complaints... :( 1.  For some reason they no longer serve beef pizza.  This is not good for someone that doesn't eat chicken or pork.  Those seem to be the only 2 meats on the menu. 2.  The wedge salads were unacceptable.  These I did pay for because we did eat them.  The lettuce was not clean and there were purple egg whites in my wife's salad. 3. I overheard one of the waitresses telling a table near us that she would have to check to see if a particular pizza was available as they hadn't taken enough skins out of the freezer.  Really????  You use frozen skins in your restaurant????  I worked in hospitality for over 20 years including 3 as a pizza dough boy (I made fresh dough every day)  I can't imagine that a major chain would use frozen dough... 3.  When we did get our dinner, a cheese pizza, there was more grease on it than came out of the Gulf Oil spill... Another pizza (after 1 bite) had the blandest tasting sauce I have ever had in my life.  It was almost as if the restaurant didn't want us to eat there and never eat there again.  I told the waitress that I refused to pay for this garbage.  None of  food was good enough to pay for.   I did pay for the salads and drinks.  Then promptly went somewhere else.  You should too... A manager never came over to hear our concerns or to attempt to right the massive wrong.  I did send mail to their Corporate office and was told that I would be hearing from a manager.  This was almost a week ago and nothing. I'm saddened that you can buy one of their frozen pizzas in the grocery store and it tastes better than it does in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160,3.32,3.35,3.35,2.724,3.338

252,Ken L.,"Pittsburgh, United States",4999,933,18953.0,3.0,2012-11-16,"Average pizza and salad at above average prices.  Here are my likes and dislikes: Carmel Peach salad - decent salad with gorganzola cheese crumbles and peach slices.  Pretty decent but the they gotta take it easy on the dressing and please give more peaches, don't be stingy!

376,Zannah B.,"Bellevue, United States",1,12,,1.0,2013-07-14,"We used to really like CPK. It was a regular in our eating our rotation. However, in August 2012 someone at their corporate office starting messing with what worked. Now the place is no longer a rotation regular and after tonight's awful experience not an even an option.  1. Uniform changes- not a major issue you think- think again.  Tonight one big issue was no one wore name tags. This would not be an issue if they wore some type of uniform so I could tell who worked at the restaurant and who did not. The outfit used to be black slacks and a logo dress shirt of some type with a name tag. Now the outfit is jeans- any color- and any color dress shirt with no logo and no name tag.  Tonight the service was so slow guests were getting up and searching the restaurant for someone to wait on them.  Also you used to be able to tell who was a manager. Generally the person with the tie and the name tag that said Bob and Manager on it. Now it is anyone's guess who is running the place as no one identified themselves as a manager during our meal.  2. When you arrive at the restaurant there used to be glass panels between the booths and the waiting area. This prevented you from having some curious child reach over into your booth while you were eating to investigate. It also gave you some semblance of privacy while dining even if the panels were clear glass. Now the panels are gone and you are left with the curious adults, those who love to ogle what you are eating, and their long armed children to pester you while dining. The panels need to go back up. 3. The food is $2-$4 higher than it used to be. Many items were dumped off the menu or changed in a way that makes it so one does not order it any longer without compunction. The Thai Crunch Salad was a favorite of mine. I can't have peanuts so I always ordered it with the Lime/Cilantro dressing instead. Well, now if you want to order it, it only comes with the peanut dressing. Sorry if you have allergies but CPK does not care.  The Jamaican Jerk Pizza, you either love it or hate it, is a heavy pizza. I mean the toppings are heavy. Why on earth would you put heavy toppings on a thin crust pizza? I ordered it not knowing it had been relegated to thin crust pizza list and spent an annoying evening reloading toppings back onto the pizza slices. Mental note now anytime I want to order it I have to ask for the original crust.  4. Table settings- CPK is not a fine dining establishment. It is a higher end pizza place in a causal atmosphere. One of the changes made were the napkins from black cloth to recycled brown paper. What a letdown. The napkins look cheap and you only get one and have to beg for more. I preferred the cloth napkins.  Then we have two large wine glasses set on the end of each table along with some annoying trifold advert for this month's specials. All items set at the end of dining tables automatically get moved to the back of the table. I know some marketing person claims otherwise but it is annoying and should be stopped. It does not motivate me to have wine with my lunch or to purchase the meal of the week. Trifold adverts remind of me of Denny's and their forever sticky dessert menus at the back of the table. YUCK!  5. Upon being seated you are no longer handed one menu, with possibly a drink menu. No, you are now handed no less than three menus and sometimes more depending on who is working in the sales and marketing departments that week. I honestly do not want to be handed several menus. I want to be handed one menu and have a drink menu placed at the end of the table. Otherwise the collection of the menus is now this size layering task for the server instead of a simple collection process. Just put the options on the menu!  Finally, our dinner experience this evening. What a travesty! I honestly felt as if I was in the Twilight Zone and dining with Gordon Ramsay on Kitchen Nightmares.  Three out of four items we tried to order they were out of.  We found this out at the initial order, then when the waitress returned 10 minutes later and then while my husband attempted to order something different. At that point our server told him what they did not have and then pointed out the two items they did have. Numerous guests got up and searched for someone, anyone to take their order, get them a drink or just show up and say ""Hi, I am your wait person"". Food took 30-40 minutes to make its way out of the kitchen. Some food items came out of the kitchen clearly ready for compost and not fit to be served to a guest. The guest behind us was told ""Your server is very busy right now but I can take your drink orders for them,"" this after I know they had been seated and waiting at least 15-20 minutes.

And from the other reviews, I'm not the only one with the stale chip incident.  Makes you wonder how long those chips were sitting back there.  I ordered The Works pizza and in all honestly from a flavor standpoint, it tastes like costco pizza. And actually in fact, for the service I received, I might as well go to costco, buy some dip, chips, and a pizza and eat it at home.  Got bad service from the start and it took 15 minutes to pay my bill. I am a college student but I also work in the resturant business and know how to tip properly when the service I get is up to par.

The waiter was very nice and did comp our bill for the drinks and kid pizza.  But the 45 minute wait wasn't worth it for the food.  Food was fine but nothing special enough to make me want to come back.  With their prime location, you'd think they'd step it up a notch with the quality and flavor of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=80,2.92,2.78,2.78,3.4960000000000004,2.836

205,Elbert F.,"Redmond, United States",1,3,,2.0,2017-06-12,"Very underwhelmed by the service. Last night I came in with my family (wife and 3 kids) to dinner for the first time. Being a first time customer I really didn't have any expectations but not in a million years did I think service would be that deficient. For starters they gave the kids those kid's menus that have activities but when we inquired about crayons they said they'd run out since Thanksgiving! Having the activity book with nothing to write with made the kids even more restless than if they had not received anything in the first place. That aside we ordered drinks (including lemonade for the now restless kids) and it took them almost 20 minutes to bring! All this while the restaurant was, at best, half full. After this waitress took our order (pizzas and an appetizer) and the waiting game began once more..after about 20 minutes they brought our pizzas out and when we inquired about the missing ( and quite frankly unwanted by this point) appetizer we were informed that they'd run out!!! How the waitress couldn't come and inform us of this BEFORE bringing our food out is something that escapes me completely. To top it off once we were done with the pizzas and asked for the check we, once more, had to wait more than 10 minutes to be charged. Don't get me wrong; the waitress was very courteous and apologetic and I actually felt bad for her but I fail to understand how a simple pizza and appetizer dinner could've taken so long to complete in a restaurant that was barely half full on a weeknight...That said, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue,2.92,2.65,2.908,2.216,2.758

2,Catherine M.,"Brier, WA",282,146,236.0,1.0,2017-10-18,"Down with CPK! A few weeks back I used a coupon from a friend (which hilariously and ironically didn't save me money but cost me more - good job marketing team, I see you). We showed up like 20 minutes before closing to place a pretty simple take out order. Attitude across the board between the bartender/takeout guy and the manager. I don't blame them for being tired and cranky, so that didn't really matter. But the food, the food matters. And the food we got sucked.  I will say the Italian chopped salad was and always has been good. The Kung pao chicken and shrimp spaghetti was a let down- small and no doubt overpriced, considering the meats add-on costs I think $7 and the portion size is truly that of a decorative garnish.. The most infuriating part of getting home with our take out was opening the pizza (Cali Cobb pizza)---- this was supposed to be the main event. And, there in the box was this little crusty thing with some cheese on it; the toppings came separate!!! (As if this is an effing toy I'm supposed to build at home) so there I am, after raving to my friend about how good the food is here, and now I'm equal parts embarrassed and disappointed. But I build my pizza (i.e. Lay out the slices of tomato, avocado, and mix the iceberg lettuce with its aoli, then top the pie with all this. With my bare hands. Cuz the chef couldn't do it. Because... the pizzas gonna get soggy...? Sure, whatever) one last thing about that pizza, a few years ago it was to die for and one of the highlights of it was the arugula they topped it with, which like I said is now a cheaper mix of iceberg. In summary, quality and value has all around fallen out the back of the truck.  It was a waste of $45. We sorta picked at it and spent most of the meal talking about how much of a let down it was. Never eating here again.  I feel sad because at one point I loved CPK. I give up with this chain *_____*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue,2.48,2.6,2.812,,2.552

1,Elbert F.,"Redmond, WA",1,3,,2.0,2017-12-06,"Very underwhelmed by the service. Last night I came in with my family (wife and 3 kids) to dinner for the first time. Being a first time customer I really didn't have any expectations but not in a million years did I think service would be that deficient. For starters they gave the kids those kid's menus that have activities but when we inquired about crayons they said they'd run out since Thanksgiving! Having the activity book with nothing to write with made the kids even more restless than if they had not received anything in the first place. That aside we ordered drinks (including lemonade for the now restless kids) and it took them almost 20 minutes to bring! All this while the restaurant was, at best, half full. After this waitress took our order (pizzas and an appetizer) and the waiting game began once more..after about 20 minutes they brought our pizzas out and when we inquired about the missing ( and quite frankly unwanted by this point) appetizer we were informed that they'd run out!!! How the waitress couldn't come and inform us of this BEFORE bringing our food out is something that escapes me completely. To top it off once we were done with the pizzas and asked for the check we, once more, had to wait more than 10 minutes to be charged. Don't get me wrong; the waitress was very courteous and apologetic and I actually felt bad for her but I fail to understand how a simple pizza and appetizer dinner could've taken so long to complete in a restaurant that was barely half full on a weeknight...That said, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue,2.6,2.61,2.768,,2.606
