L.,"Silver Spring, MD",8,240,116.0,4.0,2012-01-11,"I'm not too crazy about their pizza but I love their salads!  The BBQ Chicken Salad is my favorite.  It has bean, corn, tortilla strips, cheese, tomatoes and of course bbq chicken.  You can choose to add avocado for an extra $2.50.  The Miso Shrimp Salad is also a good choice.  It's a little lighter tasting than the BBQ Chicken Salad.  It has shrimp, edamame, and avocado.   We tried the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos and the White Corn Guacamole + Chips from the small cravings menu.  The steak tacos tasted nothing like Korean BBQ.  The White Corn Guacamole was ok but a bit on the bland side.

She came back to the table at least twice just to clarify what I wanted . This should have been my first sign... I asked her each time whether it was okay to order this and when she said it wouldn't be a problem, I was all ""Great!""   When the food arrived, BP's mom had a gorgeous salad, BP, had a scrumptious artichoke and chicken pizza and I got an appetizer.... The Korean BBQ Steak Tacos were an appetizer...  First I was very disappointed, but as many know, my eyes are bigger then my stomach and the food was a perfect portion!

The wild mushroom is pretty good too and so is the previously mentioned bbq chicken. And when I'm pretending to be a healthy eater, the veggie pizza hits the spot.

Was it me or did everything taste better because it was free?!?!  Well things are about to taste even better as the kind GM waltz over to us and offered vouchers for the same deal for fellow military folks.  Like a stack of vouchers!!  That made our day as we had friends who are stuck working at the hospital that day and could not enjoy glorious food deals. The icing on the cake?  The same kind and awesome GM walked by and noticed that we were a tad chilly in our corner.  He said something and actually did something about it!!

101,Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,247,144.0,4.0,2013-01-22,"4 stars is generous.  The food keeps the rating high.  Everyone likes CPK.  Everyone has their favorite dish at CPK.  But, everyone has their reasons why they hate CPK.   I have had all kind of items off of their menu, from salads to soups (yeah smashed pea & barely!), to strange-sounding but delicious pizzas.  Its the kind of place where you want to finish the entire pizza (its that good), but you don't want to be judged...so you take half home with you.  So good.  My gripes:  1. Prices...wow!  I would come here a lot more often if the menu was just a bit more reasonably priced.   2. The staff always seems upset at one another.  They try to not show it, but you can cut the tension with a knife.  Its like they all hate each other or hate the job or something.  I can't quite describe it other than a pervasive feeling of misery. 3. Why are there always 8 million kids in there?  It doesn't look like anyplace children would enjoy, especially considering the many bottles of wine on display at the entrance.  The 8 million kids also means the place is full of screaming and crying...I never want to stay a second longer than I have to. 4. I've only gotten take-out once, but they made me decide to never try it again.  I ordered soup and a salad.  They asked if I wanted utensils and I said yes.  I didn't receive the soup (strange, because I was charged for it).  I discovered it before leaving the parking lot, so I was able to come back in and get it.  However, I never got those utensils.  Why bother asking?  It wasn't even busy, it was like 4:00 on a weekday afternoon.  If that job is too stressful for the person working the take-out area, find someone else who doesn't cave under the pressure of putting together an order of soup and salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8960000000000004,3.1200000000000006

100,Hannah K.,"Columbia, MD",1,31,54.0,1.0,2013-02-28,"Came here on Saturday around 5pm for dinner with my sister. We needed a break from shopping so came to eat dinner here. the restaurant wasn't that busy, we just waited 5 minutes for a table to clear. The hostess took us back to our seats, and the waiter was clearing the table while we waited by our table. They didn't wipe down the table and the table was sticky. I think the previous customers spilled something sweet. I wish the hostess would have given the waiter enough time to clear and  the table properly before seating us.... Okay now to the food, the price is RIDICULOUSLY high. My sister and I ordered the California Veggie Pizza (original crust on honey wheat). The pizza wasn't anything special and didn't seem fresh. Also, the broccoli looked odd/weird. We were really excited and we thought it would be a big enough pizza to share and OH MY GOSH... the pizza is the size of a small pizza that you can order individually. I thought for a price of almost $13 we would have received a larger size. At Bertucci's (my favorite Pizza restaurant) you pay $18 (for just $4 more) for a large Margherita pizza. Bertucci's portion size is better and you can taste how fresh the dough and ingredients are. CPK lacked all those qualities in their pizza Oh and the bread we got seemed a little stale/store bought (definitely not fresh). We didn't eat any of the bread.

Unfortunately it has changed over the years and is only a small piece of what it once was.  Today, i find CPK's menu too big and too expensive.  Their portions have also gotten smaller over the years. CPK seems to have gotten away from what they do best -- Pizza.  The menu has lots of other stuff, and is almost too big and too confusing. Over the years some of my favorites have been taken off the menu for no good reason.

They think their pizza tastes bad, and you can get better pizzas for a better deal at other restaurants. But they probably have not tried what I have tried; the menu item everyone skips over, the menu item that nobody would expect, the menu item that everyone thinks will be cliche if they see it, as it is not CPK's normal style. Their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings. Now, you are probably thinking: ""Dumplings at a pizza place? They can't be good!"" Well, actually they are the best menu item they have! They aren't authentic chinese, exactly, but they still are very good! The rich, tender chicken is complemented by the extremely delicate pasta wrapper. I have never seen a pasta wrapper this delicate! And, to top it all off, it is drizzled with a delectable soy ginger chili sauce and topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Now, this is an appetizer, so don't expect it to fill your hunger up that much, you still need an entree. But these are such a great addition to your meal! Also, their dumplings aren't the only thing that is good there! More recently, I had my first dessert off their menu: Their butter cake! It is the best! It is a rich, tender cake served hot, with 6 pieces of whipped cream surrounding it. Plus, for a little more $$$, you can get it a la mode with vanilla ice cream, which I think is worth it. I also like their Thai Chicken Pizza, Peach Lemonade, Tuscan White Bean Hummus, and key Lime Pie.

We ordered a pizza that was a special, and asked for no cow dairy and no meat. We also ordered a pizza off the menu. The server clearly didn't know what was on the pizza, but I figured our instructions were sufficiently clear. She came back with a pizza with MAYONNAISE and CHICKEN all over it (after a thirty minute wait). She then went to talk to the kitchen and came back informing me that every item made by the restaurant contained cow dairy, including pasta and pizza crust. Bogus. After I expressed disbelief and asked for a box for the remaining half pizza that we had ordered without alterations, she went back to the kitchen to confer with the staff. Meanwhile, I took my kids to the bathroom. When I came out, our table had been moved and another family was sitting there. The server came up to me, handed me a bag with plain pasta in it and a check for $30 including tip. She acted surprised that our table had been cleared and suggested that we stay for another fifteen minutes so that they could make us another pizza, since they had thrown our leftovers away.

The delivery guy was older and super nice, and I sincerely hope he got the tip I entered on my credit card through Grubhub- the fact that it had to go through two companies to get to him made me a bit suspicious, and makes me think I should tip in cash in the future. Grubhub wouldn't let me select what crust we wanted for our pear and gorgonzola pizzas, so I rolled with it and left it up to fate. The crust ended up being thin crust, which I wasn't happy about (I don't like thin crust, generally). When I went to eat my pizza, one of the first things I noticed was that the crust:topping ratio was off (note: no thin crust ever again please!). The second thing I noticed was that the crust was soft, especially on the bottom, and everything on the pizza tasted slightly underdone and chewy. But simultaneously, the edges of the pizza were so crispy that if I accidentally pushed on them too hard, they broke off the slices and into little pieces. However, a few minutes in the oven at 350-400 heated the pizza up and finished cooking it. The pizza normally comes with a dressed salad on top, which they packed on the side. The salad was as I remembered, but something tasted a little off- wasn't sure if it was the dressing or slightly old and wilted lettuce (both seemed a bit off, but not sure where the taste was coming from).  The meal definitely cured my craving, but I'm not sure in the most ideal way... the meal was pretty disappointing. I suppose I'll go to this CPK in person next time the craving hits and see if it's any better than what I got delivered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.568,3.1200000000000006

Staff here is always attentive and friendly. Stopped by recently for lunch. Ordered corn tortilla soup, BBQ chicken pizza, chips w guacamole and the lettuce wraps. Everything was delicious and came out quickly. Our bill came out to around $25. CPK has a great rewards program. They have monthly specials with $10 off of $40, gift card rewards and complimentary bday dessert. So make sure you enroll. If I'm in the area craving some pizza, pasta or something innovative I always stop here. This location has an entrance from outside the mall which makes it easier for you to enter without going all around the mall.

For what they charge for this sandwich I would expect to find a few slices of turkey. Told my server about the lack of meat and he said something about changes in food preparation.

The bok choy was not properly rinsed, so sand was inside. The edge of the table was sticky, which got another kid's shirt all sticky. When the bill arrived, it included two items we had never ordered, then a subtraction of their cost as a ""comp,"" so only the actual final amount was correct.

The chicken was dry. Even though we opted out the chili, the dish was still too spicy for us to enjoy.

This is a high traffic area in the Westfield Montgomery mall so plan accordingly for your plan to park and navigate to the restaurant. My dining companion and I thought it'd be better to dine at the bar area since the wait time for tables was a long wait. The bar representative ""Frans"" did the damn thing! He was patient, made suggestions and ensured that he checked on us just enough so that it didn't disturb us while we dined. I enjoyed the Kung-Pao chicken spaghetti and the sangria flight. It was the first time having either and both were worthy in taste, price and portion. Weekend dining here can result in long wait times and if you have a small party (2 or less) then I'd recommend sitting at the bar for timely service. It gives a chance to see the pizzas being made and the hustle and flow of the kitchen staff delivering tasty dishes.  If in the area I would frequent again.

We went with the BBQ chicken pizza.  Decent crust, sweet tangy sauce, with smoky gouda, onion, and cilantro background.  Pretty good. I was less enthused about the cobb salad.  The bacon was chewy rather than crisp, I didn't taste the basil, the chicken had some seasoning but was a little dry.
