108,Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1.0,4.0,2012-01-22,If you like cheap beer and work in Beverly Hills... This is a best kept secret. The beers here are SO cheap. Look I know it's a family establishment but if you need a few cold one's after a long day with a tasty pizza (who doesn't??) then go here. I've had the habanero pizza twice now. Other fav's are the tostada and thai chicken. You really can't go wrong.

173,John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,218,12.0,1.0,2012-02-11,"Can't believe we came back here.  Again, terrible service.  3 of us were nicely greeted by the manager at the host stand and were promptly sat at a table.  We waited approximately 5 minutes and no server ever came to our table.  We were on a lunch hour so we didn't have a lot of time to kill waiting for someone to come.  I got up and asked the manager that sat us if there was anyone assigned to our table.  She came over and took our order because there must have been some mixup with who got which tables.  She came back a few minutes later and dropped the drinks off.  Nobody came by our tables from the time the drinks were dropped off to when the food was delivered.  The manager (which we assumed as acting as our server because nobody else ever came by) never came back asking if we needed anything/how we liked the food and never refilled our drinks.  A server (which we later found out was supposedly our server) dropped off the check and asked if we needed any boxes as he set down the check.  We all asked for refills since nobody ever came by as we were eating.  So we basically got our first refill the same time the bill was taken.  We paid with a gift card and asked for change with a $20 for the tip.  The gift card had $.52 left which was never returned and we were given $19 change instead of $20.  Over 5 minutes passed and nobody ever came back by, so we asked the bus boy to grab the manager.  She came by and made excuses as to why our server didn't return the gift card and why we were short changed.  This place really doesn't have their act together.  There were probably 5-6 tables of customers, and at least 12 employees.  The female manager (2/10/12 @ noon) was literally chit chatting with the employees throughout our entire meal - this is the root problem as to why our service was bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=160,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.244,2.56
175,Mimi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2012-03-10,My roommate & I come here today (CPK) have lunch. I order a wed salad and the salad look like old & left over two (2) or there (3) days ago.

A couple minutes later, the manager Esther walks over to the table and says, ""Can you describe the hair that you found; was it long or short? Dark or light?"" I looked at her with my jaw hanging open. She didn't waver in the silence and eventually said, ""I want to know so that I can see who isn't wearing their hairnet."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? She didn't apologize for the incident ONCE. As if I wasn't disgusted enough by finding a hair in my salad, the manager is going to ask me to describe it in detail? And not try to make amends?!

The waiter claimed the thick spaghetti pasta was angel hair when it clearly was not, the bolognese sauce was dry, overspiced to compensate for flavorlessness, and they really skimped on it. The great crusty sourdough they used to serve has been replaced with pasty squishy wonder-like bread. The place was loud and chaotic - filled with children running amok and squealing.  The table was dirty and there were crumbs on our chairs when we were seated.

The Thai chicken was all peanut sauce and bean sprouts, not the usual way every other CPK makes it. The wild mushroom and pepperoni were both undercooked and too thin.

I ordered a full size Cesar salad (~$12) with chicken (+$4) and a full size Chinese chicken salad (~$13). Service was OK, I wasn't greeted until a few minutes after I walked in (-1 star). Not a lot of customers in store. Took about 13 minutes for the food to be ready.  Now, the food is good enough, but a chicken cesar salad is NOT worth $16. After I drove back home, I discovered that they forgot the chicken in the Cesar salad. I'm too tired to go back but I called to tell them what's up. Me: Hi. I just ordered takeout from you guys and you forgot the chicken in the Cesar salad. Now, I'm not going to come back for it, but I thought you should know.  CPK employee: Oh. *pause* *disingenuously* We're sorry. Me: *pause* Thanks. Bye.  CPK employee: Bye.  Now they apologized, which is good (+1 star). But they clearly didn't care based off of  the half assed apology (-1 star). No offers to make my experience better or promises for what they will do next time (-1 star).  The takeout FAPS: Food: 4/5. Good when they remember what I ordered.  Atmosphere: 3/5. Slow. Parking: 3/5. It's Beverly drive, it's gonna be rough.  Service: 1/5. Could have been more engaging. Could have sincerely apologized for forgetting the chicken I paid $4 extra for. Could have told me what they would do differently next time. TL;DR: Food is good enough when they remember the order. Too pricey for basic food ($13 or $16 for a salad? Really?).

Then she went to get the rest of my order and when she returned I asked again, so you don't have butter anywhere in the restaurant? To that she responded, I guess I can go ask... Was it that big of a deal?? Lastly, I get back to the office to find that my tortilla soup I ordered wasn't tortilla soup... it was pea soup. Does no one check the orders??

Location is south of Wilshire on Beverly Blvd, so it's a little easier to manage parking wise.  At a minimum, there is a garage directly across the street, and the first 2 hours are free.  If you are into a sweet finish to a meal, go a few steps around the corner from here, and you're at 'Lette Macarons.  All you foodies out there already know the place, but for those of you who don't, go find out why I mention them.  Anyway, I digress.........

140,Shannon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,596,186.0,3.0,2015-02-28,"I am making this location my first review for CPK since they have the whole 'Reimagined Menu', which means they offer things not available in most locations.  About ready to order one of my usual defaults (turkey/chicken club sandwich on ciabtta-they no longer have focaccia bread), I noticed they had a classic crispy chicken sandwich and a oven-roasted turkey with brie that I've never seen before. I decided on the turkey since it has pears and honey mustard, which intrigued me. Pears tend to do that.  But what got me most excited was the baked potato soup and a s'mores dessert. I chose the soup over the usual caesar salad, and got the dessert to go. In all honesty, the soup was good, not great, and the dessert I feel would taste much better eating it there in the establishment. The chocolate pudding was tasty, when I could get to it, as I battled through the marshmallow topping.  After a quick search, I think Westwood also offers this menu as well. Parking sucks in either location, so if you must, get it to go so you can do the curbside takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=40,3.36,2.87,2.87,3.0840000000000005,3.066

We ordered our drinks (water) which came 10 minutes after we ordered and we ordered the macaroni and cheese for kids which came out very promptly (before the water). When we were ready to order, we told a server we were ready to order, under the impression that he was our server (if our server had taken the time to introduce himself, we would have know what he looked like). This server was not very pleased that we told him we thought he was our server and very coldly told us he was not OUR server and stomped away.  Eventually our server arrived and took our orders. The rest of the dining was fine and the food arrived promptly. The food was fine, nothing to marvel about, but remained consistent to other locations I have been at.

1,Richard R.,"Culver City, CA",88,210,1778.0,4.0,2015-07-18,"It's way too long a story to explain how we ended up eating at CPK on South Beverly Drive today. We normally go to the one in Marina del Rey or Manhattan Beach. But once we made our dining decision I was a little curious about how the Beverly Hills location would measure up with our usual expectations. Honestly everything was just a little better. First of all this location is different from the others. It's a more intimate setting. Not so cavernous. We really liked that. The service at CPK is usually good but not great. Our server Anjuli was totally on point for our entire meal. Even when she was taking care of tables around us she was excellent.  Now for the food. We ordered the Avocado Club Roll appetizer, half Thai Crunch salad (does anyone really need a full one of those?), half Chicken Caesar and a bowl of the Smashed Pea Barley soup. Every one of them was just right. Same recipes I'm sure. But the soup wasn't so overly thick (or gloppy). The proportions of the Thai Crunch salad, perfect. The ratio of crunchy noodles to lettuce to edamame to dressing is really what makes that salad work. The same was true for my Chicken Caesar (proportion wise) with the added bonus that the grilled chicken had great grilled flavor and was still so moist. The Avocado Club Roll was cooked just right and perfectly rolled so it stayed together as we were eating it. To top things off we sat right next to the window and had a front row seat for watching how people were dealing with the days sudden rainfall. How can it get any better than that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20,3.32,2.93,2.93,3.3120000000000003,3.0860000000000003

There appears to be a full bar, booths, and tables. The layout is not the cleanest, but it's very clean.  Food Admittedly, this is not my favorite restaurant. I know several people that love it. I just don't ever crave it. Plus, there aren't many vegan options without mushrooms. As always, I was craving carbs, so I opted for pasta. I ordered the Spinach and Asparagus Spaghettini (no cheese). This is perfect, because it comes in a marinara sauce. The portion is huge, so I only ate half of it. The pasta was nicely cooked, the veggies were tender, and it was the perfect amount of sauce.

A friends choice for birthday dinner forced me back and I must say that I can confirm my disappointment. Two years prior I was given a gift card for my birthday and ate at CPK in Studio City. Overall, what annoyed me the most was the very minuscule portion of Chicken on the pizza/Salad.  Anyways, this again occurred at the CPK in Beverly Hills. I ordered the Bahn Mi bowl and was highly disappointed- lack of flavor, and again, a minuscule amount of Chicken- for an expensive price compared to any other chain restaurant. I also had the Two in a bowl Soups- my choices were the Farmers Market and Sedona Tortilla. They were both tasty. The service was good, no complaints there. Overall, the stingy portions of Chicken have left a sour taste in my mouth with this place. I would  not recommend any dish with meat, in particular Chicken. By the way, it was $4 for Chicken added to the Bowl (which was $15). Crazy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills,3.24,3.35,3.35,,3.306

Their Kung pao spaghetti is spicy and flavorful, one of my favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills,3.28,3.36,3.36,,3.3280000000000003
