28,Cassius c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,2012-01-31,I love the food at CA Pizza Kitchen!  its is one of my favorite places to eat.   The service in generally good but I have had one bad experience with the wait staff.  But the pasta and dessert is to die for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006

25,Brian C.,"Henderson, KY",7,31,21.0,3.0,2013-09-01,We were seated within 10 minutes for our party of seven on a Sunday night.   Our server was friendly and exchanged chit chat with our group as she took our drink order. Our food arrived in about 15 minutes after our order was placed. The orders were exactly right. I ordered a half size Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and it was quite good. Lots of chicken with just enough dressing. My wife and son ordered a pepperoni and bacon pizza and it was quite good she said. My wife also ordered a White Corn Guacamole appetizer and she really enjoyed that. Our server took good care of us and all in all it was a pretty good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
10,Ee Vonn Y.,"Oakland, CA",1167,1709,3217.0,3.0,2013-11-15,I really prefer the Summit location over the Galleria purely out of my preference for restaurant interiors with lower booths and an open layout. The waiter was courteous and helped me out the entire time I was there. They ran out of sausage that night which was a bummer so instead I asked for extra salami. The Sicilian is average and very greasy. The white pie has more bread than anything. I wish the cheese was more melted. Refrigerator Test: No. Not even reheating this by oven will soften out the mighty tough crust.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
17,Griffin S.,"Birmingham, AL",165,34,16.0,4.0,2014-06-14,"I love CPK. Generally, good service.  Always great food. Love their pizzas and their pastas are very good too! Underrated appetizers too.  Only thing that disappoints me and reason for 4 stars, they don't offer the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza anymore! Grrr! However, in a bind and not sure what to go eat? CPK is a safe bet for a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
23,B. H.,"Birmingham, AL",0,46,,4.0,2014-08-25,"Solid choice for a nationwide pizza company. You have many choices to choose from in terms of pizza toppings, I personally love the pear and gorgonzola. Their appetizers don't exactly seem to be related to pizza, but at the same time the dumplings we got were really good. Their iced flavored teas were pretty tasty too. As to the size of the pizza's, you could split one with someone, or get one for yourself and have leftover for the next day and not break the bank.  The floors were pretty dirty, lots of trash on the floor the last time I went in, there was a large group (several tables together) of guys there at the moment, but I don't think it was all from them, they had not been there too long, so I think. The service was great though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,,,,,
20,Brian H.,"San Francisco, CA",54,130,24.0,4.0,2014-10-16,"Stopped in and grabbed a Jerk Chicken thin crust and a sweet tea.  Pleasant service, tasty food, and a pretty good experience. CPK is a chain, so it's obviously nothing to write home about, but this location was everything I wanted from it during my visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,,,,,
22,Brandon C.,"Birmingham, AL",51,7,,4.0,2014-12-06,"Late evening dinner with the wife went great. Dumplings for an app. Came out quickly and were devoured just as quick (I love those little things!). Dinner, wife had the half Chinese Chicken salad. From the portion, if that's a half, I'm a little scared to see the full sized. That thing was HUGE. I ordered the Sicilian. It was good. Nothing to write home about, but tasty. Service was attentive without being overbearing. All in all, a good simple date night. Thanks CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,,,,,
12,Lacy W.,"Birmingham, AL",34,95,114.0,5.0,2015-02-23,"This place is so underrated. I love the Gorgonzola Pear pizza and the barbecue chicken salad. And the butter cake for dessert is always a must! The frozen, non-alcoholic drinks are also very delicious. I love the frozen raspberry lemonade. My husband tried the new halibut dish this weekend and it tasted like something from a five-star restaurant. I'm always happy with the food and the service when I go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
18,Lucy T.,"Birmingham, AL",272,208,276.0,4.0,2015-04-21,I shared mini quesadillas as an appetizer. They were pretty good. I had some sort of pizza that was covered in lettuce. A little too much for me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
13,Jessica M.,"Birmingham, AL",25,44,166.0,4.0,2015-07-27,"Though I think the Service could have been better, I think the pizza was delicious. I got the classic barbecue chicken pizza on the gluten-free crust. I know its not the same as regular pizza which I miss, but so far this is the closest I've come. On a Friday night this was the least busiest restaurant in the area. I will probably just order for the pizza to be delivered after this. The pizza saved this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
21,Terre J.,"Birmingham, AL",17,17,1.0,2.0,2015-08-27,"I've eaten here many times over the last ten years. It's always ok, the food is pretty good, the service is fine, but it has always had a musty, damp smell. Today I went there and the smell had moved from mild to strong. It's like the rag they used to wipe down the tables yesterday had been left overnight on your table. It was really unappetizing. In such a busy location, I can't believe they can't find the source of the smell and get rid of it, before the Summit's new pizza place puts them out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3?start=20,,,,,
15,Kierra R.,"Birmingham, AL",62,14,34.0,5.0,2016-01-05,"One of my favorite restaraunts! I absolutely love dining at CPK. I recommend the California Club Pizza for starters (if you love avocado), or the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza with the lime cream sauce. There pastas are also delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
8,Preston L.,"Birmingham, AL",1,21,2.0,1.0,2016-02-22,"I met some close friends Saturday night at CPK and we all were very surprised how bad the food was. They appeared to be understaffed. The Salmon was not good, all the entrees were cold. We sent one meal back and after 20 min we had to wave down the manager. He removed the meal off  of our check and give us free desserts.  CPK had a bad night, I hope they recover because we like this place .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
14,Richard C.,"Birmingham, AL",19,19,6.0,2.0,2016-05-31,Not impressed with the food at CPK.  I got the spaghetti bolognese.  I make better spaghetti at home.  There was hardly any seasoning. It comes with an unidentifiable  meat in the sauce  that had no flavor. No salad.  Had to ask for bread.  The server brought out a couple  small pieces.  At $16.00 that should be the best spaghetti you've ever tasted. I  took the leftovers  home and fixed it.  A companion  had a margarita. I don't  drink  much  but I think $11.00 for a  small cocktail  is too much. The service was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
4,Nick B.,"Birmingham, AL",84,208,126.0,5.0,2016-07-13,"I've come to realize that I don't care for CPK. Yes I'm starting my review like this. The fact that a chain, dine-in style, pizza restaurant isn't my preference won't be reflected in this review. I'll just state that the service we received from (wish I remembered her name) was great! She was very patient and VERY helpful with providing comparisons and personal experience etc when it came decision making time. Mind you this was all, just short of the restaurant being closed for the evening. She paid the right amount of attention to our table and made us feel welcomed.  Our server gets 5 stars... CPK? Meh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
16,Reviewer P.,"Birmingham, AL",38,114,1.0,4.0,2016-11-23,"This CPK is much better than the former Hoover location due to their service and better food. Jason, the manager, is one of the best managers I have seen in a restaurant, and the service here is top-notch. The food is very good here, especially the vegetarian pizzas, and the servers can customize pizzas to your liking. While the CPK Spring Rolls have smaller portions than they have had in the past, the food and bread makes up for this. Overall, I would visit back to this CPK, as it has some of the best service in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
9,Deema F.,"Little Rock, AR",0,3,,4.0,2016-12-02,"I was served by the nicest and most considerate waiter I've ever met at this restaurant. I don't remember if he was wearing a name tag, but I wish I knew his name so I could mention it here. I was really hungry and given that I'm a vegan I don't always find good vegan food at non-vegan restaurants, but he went above and beyond to make sure I found something in the menu to eat. They don't serve vegan food per se, but he went and asked their chef various times about things I asked him about. I ended up having their hummus spread and quinoa salad. He made sure my salad didn't have cheese in it. I almost have a crush on this gentleman. I think he's in his early twenties, has brown hair and he's white. Thank you so much and best of luck to you if you're reading this ^_^ And last but not least, I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because they don't have many vegan options, the service is great nevertheless!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
6,Sadia D.,"Birmingham, AL",3,22,14.0,1.0,2017-03-14,This is a great place to go to if you enjoy an inedible and overpriced food. My friend and I ordered two separate dishes. Both of which were completely disgusting.  It's disappointing to have bad pizza at a place that has pizza in it's name. I really should have known better coming from California. The California pizza kitchen there are terrible as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
1,Rhett B.,"Birmingham, AL",98,228,432.0,4.0,2017-03-21,"I've been making my way around the Summit slowly since I've moved to the Birmingham area.  I wanted to give California Pizza Kitchen a try since they have a club that gives you free stuff for your birthday and other various times. To be honest, I really feel like this restaurant's name is totally misleading.  It doesn't remind you of anything of California or a Pizza palace.  The restaurant makes me think of something similar to Olive Garden with its looks, atmosphere, and menu. I chose to sit at the bar since I was by myself and there were spots open.  It also meant I didn't have to wait.  I ordered sweet tea and it was on the bitter side.  It was serviceable.   I ordered what California Pizza Kitchen is known for - it's BBQ chicken pizza.  While I waited, they bring out the bread and olive oil/herb mix that you find at Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill.  My pizza came out and right before I started tearing into it, the manager caught it and said he had another one coming out for me.  I would have ate it but it was on the crispy side of things and I enjoyed my new, fresh pizza more.  I took the crispy, slightly burnt one home with me.  But I was impressed that the manager caught that and did that on his own without me saying anything.  The pizza itself was sliced into 6 slices and big enough for me to eat by myself.  I definitely couldn't have shared it with anyone else by the size of it.  It had a good, light BBQ taste to it with the chicken, onions, and cheese blend on it.  It was not greasy at all and I enjoyed it. But after the bill came, I realized that I could have went to Papa John's or Pizza Hut and ordered a large pizza for a few dollars less.  I would have also had a whole pizza for 2 meals instead of one.  My dinner size pizza from California Pizza Kitchen was $14.59 and the bitter sweet tea I had was $2.99.  Papa John's or Pizza Hut might have been more greasy, but I would have felt more satisfied with either one of those than California Pizza Kitchen.  There is a wide variety of things to choose on the menu but I don't understand why it has pizza kitchen in its name with so much to choose from.  It was good but with the price and value for what I got, I should give it a 3.  But the manager catching that crispy pizza for me, I will bump it up to a 4 and give it another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
11,R G.,"Chelsea, AL",1,36,,1.0,2017-05-06,"This was another attempt since my last visit in 2015. I was hoping things had improved, because I used to really like this place. It was worse... salad was not fresh again - many wilted leaves & almost inedible. Ok I know it's a pizza place, but salmon is on the menu. Run, its awful! The booth across from us was torn & restaurant needs some TLC. My friend's pizza was ok, but it wasn't anything special. CPK has gone way down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,
19,Betty H.,"Auburn, AL",0,15,,1.0,2017-05-09,"Do not go here! I have eaten here 3 or 4 times and the food was okay, service okay. Nothing special. This past Monday my sister and I went for lunch at 11 when they open due to me having an appointment at 12. They were open, we walked in and all the workers were toward the back and just stared at us. It was two or three minutes past 11. Finally one slowly makes her way to the front, does not speak to us but says we still have then looked at the clock and said oh and pulled out menus. At this point I looked at my sister and said we are SO out of here! We turned and walked out. I have never been treated with such disrespect anywhere. She never actually looked at us and never welcomed us. Her demeanor highly suggested she wasn't happy to see a customer. I can guarantee her I will NEVER visit that restaurant and will alert all my friends to the problem I encountered! She has no business working in any capacity with the public!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,,,,,

2,Ami N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",62,1,2.0,1.0,2017-10-09,"First timer. Last timer. Came in to a restaurant full of dirty tables. Whole counter dirty. Sat at the counter anyways. Waited 5 minutes to even be acknowledged. For the girl to wipe the entire counter around us. My company then asked to borrow her towel so we could wipe the counter in front of us. She then asked to move to a clean area. Another 6 minutes before she asked what we wanted to drink. Another few minutes before she started even making our margaritas. No salt on our rim, thanks. So while the girls are busy chatting, texting, and snapchatting dirty tables are being left and people are waiting to be helped. After my salad came I was left to find silverware on my own. Needless to say. I won't be back. I wouldn't waste your time either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
3,Todd H.,"Greenville, AL",43,15,7.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"This is, without a doubt, the worst service we've received this weekend while in Birmingham. Our waitress was Most inattentive and seemed not to mind that THREE tables left her area while we were there. We only learned her name after she brought the check and I asked! While we did tip her more than 20%, only because we ordered bar drinks and assumed she would have to share her tip, the service wasn't worthy of our generosity. Upon mentioning her poor service to a person we assumed to be management, they made excuses for her. We will not be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-birmingham-3,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
