SOOOO GOOD!!!   But, if you are craving some pizza... well, you will have a long list to choose from.  Unfortunately they lost a star because they took my favorite pizza off the menu:  The Greek!  GONE... bye bye... never to be heard from again.  But, they still have one of the best, the pear and Gorgonzola pizza.  Get it on honey whole wheat, totally worth it.  Slices of pear on the pizza, with hazelnuts and topped with a salad of arugula and Parmesan.  Very very good.  The Thai and the carnitas is really good too.       I've never had anything else there besides soup, salad, pizza and dessert.  The peach tea is pretty decent too!  Overall, its a decent place to grab some food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=60,3.372,3.372,3.372,3.372,3.372

I've also had the garlic and cheese pizza. The last time I had it though I thought it didn't have as much garlic taste as I remembered so I was a little disappointed. The flavored teas are tasty and appetizer wise the spinach artichoke dip and the dumplings are definite winners. The fried Mac and cheese from the starter menu however is a bust.

My friend and I arrived a bit later than the rest of the party and was happy to see that the waitress could accomodate our beverage orders quickly.  Pressed for time I skipped the appetizers and went straight for the carnitas pizza on a thin crust.  When the food for the rest of the table was brought out, I realized my pizza was prepared on a regular crust. Having noticed the error, our waitress offered to remake the pizza. As we were waiting (no more than 5 mins later) the manager brings over the white corn appetizer as a courtesy.  It was delicious! Nice chunks of avocado mixed into white corn and jicama.  My pizza arrived within minutes and was absolutely delicious. The flavors were better than expected and was very filling.  When our check was brought out, the manager had comped both the appetizer and the pizza for the delay in delivery and mix-up.

35,MW B.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,22,,3.0,2013-12-10,"We got to CPK regularly because we live close by and they have decent food. We usually eat at the restaurant  Tonight we ordered a to-go order, for the first time, for a family of 4. Two pizzas- Spinach and Artichoke and BBQ Chicken Pizza, and two cups of Tortilla Soup. And a side Caesar salad. We ordered online and we're told to pick up at 7:10.  When we got there we had to wait for our order because they said the pizza is still in the oven. They brought us our food and good thang we looked because our soup wasn't in there.  We live less than 2 miles from CPK. By the time we got home our pizza was cold. I could understand it being warm but it was literally cold.  The soups were almost laughable. They were hot but were filled up MAYBE a 1/4 of the container. If that's their cup size, that is a very expensive cup at $4.25.  I would advise for a to-go/online order you make sure to really check your order before leaving the restaurant. We ended up having to heat up the pizza when we got home.  We did call to let the manager know and their customer service definitely is superior to other places. We will be back because of their excellent customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=40,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
31,Brad S.,"Coral Springs, FL",50,138,104.0,4.0,2013-12-21,"Never been to one, as wasn't sure of the concept. California pizza? Do I make my own? And not real big on chains either. But I was always curious, and having been Xmas shopping all afternoon, and not really desiring mall court food, we went with the convenience of having the CPK right at the end of the mall we finished at. Fate brought me to try this place. I really liked the interior, the lights were not bright nor was it dark and we were seated right away. They have flat screens and a view of the kitchen.  So first glance of the menu and I see you don't stick the pizza in yourself. Hmm ok, lets try the Moroccan spiced chicken and white-corn guac and chips. I should have realized right away the ""California"" means ""Avocado-in-everything"". We ordered the ""California Club"" pizza. Hey we're at CPK, may as well live out the experience the whole way through! And sure enough, our pizza looked like a salad complete with avocados on top. I'm not complaining, I grew up with them and love them. But my wife doesn't at all, and my kid... forget about it. So I wound up eating mostly all of them, but next time will be holding back on ordering the guac. I was going to give a 3-and-a-half-star, but little things bumped it up. The peach iced tea was great, the bread came with a dipping sauce and was attentive and we just enjoyed the evening after being tired of walking round the mall, so it bumped it up to a 4-star. Would I come again? Sure, but be mindful of all the items with avocado, i'm surprised they haven't come up with a avocado desert! hmmmmm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.3760000000000003,3.3600000000000003

My favorite from past visits would be the Fire Roasted Chile Relleno. I absolutely love it. The chile relleno consist of spicy poblano that is stuffed with chicken, cheese, roasted corn, black bean salsa, wild mushrooms, spinach and eggplant. I have also had the Pesto Cream Penne and it was delicious as well.   Recently I came here for lunch. Service was very fast and our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I decided to give the lunch duo a try. My pick was the 7"" pepperoni pizza with the  sedona tortilla soup. Our orders were ready super quick. This duo definitely fills you up.

We saw a lot of new faces. Looked like new management. When we said it had been a while since our last visit the hostess named Emily took time to tell us about the new menu. Chris, the manager, came over to greet us shortly after Emily left the table. He wanted to welcome us back and thank us for coming in. He mentioned that CPK was reinventing their menu selection and their look and that Boca was one of the first to do so. He recommended the halibut and the ribeye steak since they were new items. Our server was Jaquez, who was such a polite server. We loved the halibut, the butter cake, the service, the ambiance and the welcoming staff who made sure we loved our experience.

37,Fedo F.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,,1.0,2015-03-10,"I had to write this review for all the CPK take-out lovers like my self. One star is overrated for the repeated experiences my family has been having with this company. We fell in love with CPK while in Culver City CA and had great experiences as we did later at the Palm Beach Garden FL location: great staff, great food, great service. When we moved to Boca Raton it all went downhill. Pretty much every take-out we get is missing items or we receive smaller portions then we ordered. We had contacted the location from the very first time it happened and the resolution we were offered was for us to drive right back and pick up the missing item (about a 30 min drive for us...while CPK does offer delivery for some extra cash it seams an error on their part is not worth management those extra bucks to get it delivered....not even when repeatedly commiting the same mistake over and over and over again drawing shoulders and blaming it on management). For those unfamiliar with the reasoning: not providing a service or product that has been payed for is simple: theft! Last attempt was at the Wellington FL location where we were given again an item short and a salad filled with rotten black avocados...the math of which skips me: gourmet prices for low end fast-food services and products.  But it does not end here: my husband finally got trough to management (national) and presented his complaint. with heartfelt apologies for the money and trouble we were offered a gift card that was supposed to arrive sometime...since november?! last year! the next deplorable experience we had we tried to contact them again and were once again offered heartfelt apologies for both the crappy service and for not receiving our compensation and were told we were going to receive our gift card. It is march now...still nothing. Fact is, I would not eat from KPC if they had Buddha him self on the staff. It is not a decision we took on an impulse but after multiple sessions of ""rape"" and disrespect for a regular paying customer. It almost feels like they are being cheap asses trying to save a buck on our behalf...which should never be the philosophy of a company with their pricing. I actually took the energy to contact consumer protection services and, believe it or not, i hate complaining as  i hate spending time on the web writing long reviews like this one. I do no longer even trust the quality or sanitary conditions they have as such loose treatment of customer orders and complaints denote negligence and carelessness and, well, you know ""the way we do anything is the way we do everything"" hope this is helpful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9480000000000004,3.3600000000000003

Whenever my friends and I can't pick a place to eat, we end up here. The thai crunch salad is my favorite thing on the menu. It's actually my favorite salad ever. The salad is fresh and has a little bit of a kick in the dressing. I once bought a bottle of the dressing to go... My other fave is their mac and cheese with edamame. You wouldn't think to add edamame to it, but I promise it's fire. Sometimes I get a half salad and a kid's mac, when I crave both of these. I have never had a complaint with this location.

My friends and I go here often because of its universal appeal--literally anyone can eat here and be happy with the menu. I love the Waldorf Salad and jalapeño fettuccini Alfredo. The thai crunch salad is also amazing (the best version of that type of salad in my opinion), and the soup is surprisingly tasty. They also do side by side soups and if you're an indecisive nerd like me then you will find that pretty cool.  Contrary to their name, I don't think their pizzas are anything too special. I'll order the pizza occasionally because I like the personal sized portion, but I've definitely had better pizza. I don't think they get enough credit for their drinks.

You can make reservations and call do ahead seating as well. It's located in Town Center Mall by Saks Fifth Avenue. CPK works well with big parties. I have tried many entrees on their Menu including the Kids Menu and love all of them. From their pizzas and pastas to their salads and appetizers everything has great flavor. They also give you bread with a seasoned olive oil dipping sauce. Sometimes they forget to bring it out, so you have to ask for it. My favorite dish on the Kids Menu is the Mac and Cheese with edamame. You can choose whether you want the edamame or not (it's a small extra charge). The dish is pretty big and sometimes I can't even finish it. My favorite salad is the Asian Thai Crunch with Chicken. It has crunchy rice noodles, peanuts, and the dressing has a little kick to it, but nothing crazy. My favorite pasta is the Mushroom pasta. It is filled with flavor and if you love mushrooms, try this out. I've tried most of the pizzas and all of them were delicious. I love the thin crust. CPKs portions are pretty big. It  may look small in the dish, but it is more than enough! Sometimes when I come here with my family, we'll order a pizza and 2 or 3 entrees to share.  The service here is awesome. Every waiter I've had always came to the table several times throughout my meal to refill water or to ask if we needed anything. The wait is never long either and it's great that it is in the mall because you can go walk around and shop, which makes time go by faster! CPK is a relaxed environment, no need to dress up, but you can if you want.

I had the Sahara desert - oops, I mean the Italian chopped.  It was drier than the Sahara desert!  I could have picked some greens and thrown them on my plate and it would have tasted the same.  The general consensus of everyone was that the appetizers were just okay.   For my main course, I ordered the Margarita pizza.  Although it clearly states on the menu (as does every single restaurant I have ordered this from) that it comes with Italian tomatoes, there was not a single tomato on the pizza.  I asked the waiter where the tomatoes were and he said they're in the sauce!  For real??  Noooo!  A Margarita pizza means there are tomatoes ON TOP. The others in our party who ordered pizza all said the same thing; they were just okay, nothing special and on top of that they tasted as if they were premade and reheated.  Hard crusts on the top and they looked very dried up.   This was my third and final time dining in CPK.  There is nothing redeeming about it.  The service was so-so, food was subpar and overall not worth returning for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

(It's located near Nordstrom's).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
6,Alex Z.,"Orlando, FL",0,20,5.0,3.0,2017-12-06,Service is pretty hit or miss but the Thai Chicken Pizza is bomb! Always get it with extra sauce on the side to dip the crust in. Right combo of sweet and spicy. Low key (not so low key) wish they'd bring back the buffalo chicken pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
