CPK is right on par with the rest of the chain restaurant fare at the Pru (Legal, PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory), so it's certainly not a bad decision to stop in if you're looking for a meal after you're done shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=80,3.0,2.93,2.93,2.8600000000000003,2.958

We were set to come in here after the Jimmy Fund Walk, we had a party of 11 and Rafael was nice enough to accommodate everything for our party as we arrived. We sat and our troubles began when we were introduced to Charolette.  First off, it's quite clear she lacked the personality and work ethic to even be in on a Sunday afternoon. She seemed incredibly slow and confused the entire time she took simple drink orders. The drinks arrived late and unorganized, some missing ingredients even! The food arrived with the drinks, we sat around as they did nothing and continued to talk amongst themselves. I get it, it's a Sunday, you don't wanna be here, but really? The food was even horrible quality, the halibut was undercooked, the foods with dairy allergies had dairy! Charlotte seemed incredibly uninterested and even to protect herself brought out the slip to show proof she requested it the correct way. What good does that do for me? The waitress or waiter is supposed to let the kitchen know it's wrong and immediately solve it. Not sit in front of the person and say oh I'm sorry, want something else?  We waited forever to simply eat and enjoy after a long committed walk. The general vibe of this place was just lazy and their employees clearly not invested in a job at all. Several people need employment, why stay where you're miserable? You're only making the experience awful for the proprietors.  My suggestion is regardless of the day of the week, hire servers who look and act like they're alive; not dreary, undetermined or disconnected from reality.

15,Zabin B.,"Framingham, MA",0,41,4.0,2.0,2017-09-24,"Service is so pathetic. As we sat down our server came and took the order for drinks. She came back with the drinks and took our food orders. We were hungry. We were waiting for the complimentary bread that never came. After while, sitting there clueless, one lady came with our appetizers. She was so fast, that the moment we realized we didn't have plates, she had already gone. Again we waited for our server to show up. Even though our food was there in front of us, we couldn't eat it. Finally after a while she showed up, we asked for plates. When she went to get plates, I opened the cutlery from the paper towel and what did I see, a dirty fork. I was losing it. The place was not even full, I don't know what she was busy with. She came back, while I told her about the fork, my husband realized she got us dirty plates . Really??? He was quick in letting her know, coz God knows when she will be back. She came back with cutleries and plates. At that time she bothered to ask us, do u want th complimentary bread??? We were so busy digging inc we just nodded as we were not sure. Then came our pizza, the main course, but the complimentary bread appetizers were no where in the picture. Finally she got them, but we couldn't eat it, as we were already eating our ordered food. The important thing is we were really pissed off with the way the service was there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2,2.32,2.71,2.86,,2.5540000000000003
1,Araxie Y.,"Cambridge, MA",39,167,9.0,1.0,2017-09-24,"Where do I begin?  We were set to come in here after the Jimmy Fund Walk, we had a party of 11 and Rafael was nice enough to accommodate everything for our party as we arrived. We sat and our troubles began when we were introduced to Charolette.  First off, it's quite clear she lacked the personality and work ethic to even be in on a Sunday afternoon. She seemed incredibly slow and confused the entire time she took simple drink orders. The drinks arrived late and unorganized, some missing ingredients even! The food arrived with the drinks, we sat around as they did nothing and continued to talk amongst themselves. I get it, it's a Sunday, you don't wanna be here, but really? The food was even horrible quality, the halibut was undercooked, the foods with dairy allergies had dairy! Charlotte seemed incredibly uninterested and even to protect herself brought out the slip to show proof she requested it the correct way. What good does that do for me? The waitress or waiter is supposed to let the kitchen know it's wrong and immediately solve it. Not sit in front of the person and say oh I'm sorry, want something else?  We waited forever to simply eat and enjoy after a long committed walk. The general vibe of this place was just lazy and their employees clearly not invested in a job at all. Several people need employment, why stay where you're miserable? You're only making the experience awful for the proprietors.  My suggestion is regardless of the day of the week, hire servers who look and act like they're alive; not dreary, undetermined or disconnected from reality. Charlotte was just insufferable, half asleep and not even empathetic. She just was a mumbling girl that attempted to serve us food that sadly was not edible. Suffice it to say, we left happily and most certainly won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2,2.36,2.75,2.884,,2.5940000000000003

0,Steven P.,"Brookline, MA",159,36,1.0,3.0,2017-10-12,"Ambience: Located in the Prudential Shopping Mall, it is a decent spot to dine and shop. I like the modern look and basic bar setting. There isn't much flashiness to the whole restaurant, but it is clean and comfortable, which counts for something. Service: Our waiter was nice and the service was pretty quick between taking our orders and delivering on said orders.  Food: My table ordered the buffalo cauliflowers, spring rolls of different varieties and I personal got a large cobb salad. The buffalo cauliflower was delicious, mostly due to the tangy sauce. I felt the spring rolls were decent, however I wouldn't order them again. Lastly, the cobb salad was huge, fresh and tasty. I like the large portion of avocado and chicken.  Overall Rating: Overall this place earns 3 out of 5 stars. I was not blown away by this place, but did enjoy my meal. I think the atmosphere was overall average, service again average and food pretty good. I would recommend to try this place since it's relatively affordable and provides quite the variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2,2.24,2.66,2.836,,2.492
