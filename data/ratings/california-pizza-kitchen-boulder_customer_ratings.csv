38,E M.,"Louisville, CO",0,14,1.0,1.0,2012-03-03,"- Dirty glasses (odor in mine and wife's was sticky) - Soup was tasteless - My pizza was cold (server said she just pulled it out of the oven...so) - Son's order was incorrect - We're not going back To add insult to injury, someone came out (manager, maybe) and asked how dinner was.  We told her and she said she took off the soup and my son's pizza.  Big deal...that was expected.  Is that unusual for you to try and entice your customers to return after providing them with a lackluster experience?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
37,Ash C.,"Boulder, CO",4,52,32.0,1.0,2012-03-25,"* many workers milling around, but no one came to seat us for 6-7 minutes * all workers (that I could see near the bar) were interested in only talking with each other * Vivien was not attentive (to put it nicely) and never checked on our table * my boyfriend's dish was cold * mine TOO salty * service TERRIBLE. she had more interest eating and talking than serving our table * Vivien never stayed long enough for us to ask for more napkins, pepper, etc * food too pricey for what we expected.  * had to flag her down to talk to her * Vivien had two tables that time. Never bothered to spend more than 10 seconds at our table * never came back to check on our table * had to flag her down again for the check * Vivien had to be reminded (on multiple occasions) about our order, what we wanted, our check, napkins, etc * Moracon Chicken Salad- barely any chicken. Really now? We paid $10 for that.....what a waste. * Clam pasta - 4 baby clams. All overcooked, too. Tasted like salted rubber erasers. *** Bottom line: spend your hard earned money elsewhere. The food is mediocre at best, service very poor (from seeing all the other idle, non working servers), and the mediocre food is overpriced. My chicken piccata was all salt and it was $16. ""Never again, CPK"" there's a reason I've heard people say that to me. I was very disappointed because the place wasn't packed, they had plenty of servers, Vivien only had two tables, and we had so many problems. First impression, too, and it's just sad. If the food was spectacular, which their prices hint at, I wouldn't have been this upset. But as the night progressed, I experienced different problems. I normally never write reviews about a restaurant I visit because I go mainly to eat delicious foods, but I thought I had to share this with others who are thinking about venturing to CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

54,Cindy B.,"Boulder, CO",0,1,,5.0,2014-04-24,"So today my tire went flat at work. AAA came and picked it up and took it to Discount Tire for a new set of four as it was way past time for all new tires.  Lunch time arrived but there weren't any restaurants close enough to walk to from work.  For the first time ever, I considered having something delivered.  The Hungry Buffs site showed over 70 restaurants that could deliver to my work address.  I selected California Pizza Kitchen.  I've never been there in person, but their 1/2 sandwich and soup for just under $10.00 sounded perfect.  I got the California Club with Turkey and the Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley Soup.  Because I was ravenous after reading a bunch of menu's, I also ordered the Avocado Club Egg Rolls, also just under $10.00.  My food arrived in 15 minutes.  Good thing too because I was eyeballing the donation goodie box that charges $1.25 per candy bar.  Right now I am sated and so pleased with my first foray into food delivery (pizza and chinese don't count), that I decided a review was in order.  I took that sandwich and tore off a piece of the delicious bread and dipped it into the soup.  Oh heaven!  BIG pieces of real turkey, not the thin sliced pressed turkey you usually get.  Smooth creamy avocado, hearty flavorful bacon.  The rest of the meal proceeded with dipping the whole sandwich into the soup until every bite was gone.  YUM!  But I still had the Avocado Club Egg Rolls, THREE large egg rolls.  Full that I was, I just had to have one of the egg rolls, and planned on leaving the rest for a snack later or lunch tomorrow.  Delicious, crunchy, creamy with two different sauces, which are good, I tried both.  But the egg rolls by themselves were perfect.  Somehow managed an additional half of one (the LARGE half!) before putting the lid back on and putting them away for later.  I understand CPK is a chain, but I'd never been to one before, even when they came into Boulder years ago.  Some of the online reviews speak of poor service and so-so food with rather high prices.  Did I feel like I was tempting the foodie gods by ordering online delivery from a business I've not tried in person?  Yep.  Did I luck out?  Oh Yeah!  I enjoyed it enough that I will speak of my experience in a positive manner and will go to the restaurant in person someday soon.  Many thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.548,2.88

In addition, they have almost 0 customization when it comes to pasta. They have the shrimp jambalya which includes ham, shrimp, crawfish, chicken , etc (way too many meats). They could not remove the ham out of everything else.

They came with marinara dipping sauce. The mushroom pizza was about 10 inches big, and it was filled with mushrooms, cheese and no sauce. The crust was brooklyn style, and overall it was tasty. The veggie pizza was okay, it was not as good as the mushroom pizza. It has a mild tomato sauce, a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese, and  it has a lot of vegetables including broccolini.

The salad was pretty bland, but the pizza made up for the lack of taste. My wife is a cheese connoisseur, and loved the blend of cheese. As far as atmosphere goes, having the pizza preparation open to public viewing provides some much needed entertainment. This location has only 2 televisions which were showing local news without closed captioning. Because of this, don't plan on going to CPK unless you are going purely for the dining experience.

I guess that I will have to go elsewhere with my party of one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
2,D T.,"Boulder, CO",0,1,,4.0,2017-07-13,"Brought my family here yesterday for a quick bite while doing errands and was surprised in a good way. Honestly, we didn't expect to be treated so well or to enjoy the meal as much as we did!   The service was impeccable, starting with the host who engaged me early and listened to my needs for a quiet booth and leading through the meal service.  Teddy our waiter was super attentive but not overburdening.  If anything, there seemed to be many more staff than necessary given the late lunch hour. The food was very good.  We both got the lunch deal with pizza and a salad for $12.  The dough was tasty and the ingredients were fresh. The pizzas were tasty but just a tad on the small size.  Definitely no leftovers from the meal?  My Caesar salad was pretty stock but Ashley's salad with couscous and walnuts was great.  Unlimited iced tea, bread, olive oil and butter definitely helps! We will be back and not just because we got a free app coupon.  Very convenient especially when shopping around 29th street mall and considering the lunch price point, early is a better value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

8,Brittney L.,"Nipton, CA",0,18,4.0,1.0,2017-08-27,"We have been to a number of CPKs around the county this one is by far the worst I have ever been in. There were only 5 tables that were sat and even then our entire order got messed up. Our spring rolls came out cold, our drinks took 20 minutes to make it to the table, and our pizza was made incorrectly due to the server not ringing it in properly. I know those because the runner showed us the ticket. Let's note this was an allergy. The server then proceeded to not come out or apologize to let us know what had happened. Instead she hid in the back. The manager never came over either. After the pizza finally came out the server never came back by to fill our drinks or make sure our pizza was correct. We watched the manager server and bar tender stand around and chat for about 15 ish minutes as well while multiple tables were clearly needing attention. This was apparent by the multiple waving arms around the restaurant. This is clearly the picture of a mismanaged staff that is untrained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
3,Birchann P.,"Boulder, CO",105,29,1.0,1.0,2017-08-27,Worst gluten free pizza I have ever had. I mean really bad. You can get a better gluten free pizza out of a box. Salad was normal.

My boyfriend had a pizza that he loved.  We will probably go back because of the great service, I'll stay away from the pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

Very cool. It's also kind of smoggy in there though. The pizza is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boulder,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
