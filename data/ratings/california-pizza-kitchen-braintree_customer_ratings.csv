The location is a little weird in the SSP, it's in the new Nordstrom's wing... but halfway down, it's seems a little out of place. I noticed that there's even an ""outdoor"" patio area, which lets you actually be in the hallway of the mall... why in the world you would want that is beyond me! When we went in there was only a few people in the whole restaurant. Our server was nice but the food was horrible. We ordered an appetizer, the fried Mac and Cheese, which tasted like it had freezer burn, gross. Kelly and I both ordered a pizza and they honestly tasted like they came from the freezer section at Target downstairs. There's absolutely no way that it was any sort of fresh.

I was too lazy to walk to the other end of the mall.. luckily we noticed there was a CPK.  I have been to a CPK before.. once at Galleria Mall and Prudential. Both times were okay so I didn't expect anything different. We were seated fairly quickly.. the restaurant is large.. good for big groups but it's not as big as the Cheesecake factory. On the menu they have some new ""smaller plate"" items which are great if you're coming for apps and drinks. We were hungry!! So we ordered the ""small plate"" Mac n Cheese bites and Guacamole with chips. We also shared the Habanero Carnitas Pizza. The Mac n Cheese bites were bland but they were crispy. It needed more cheese. I really enjoyed my gauc with chips. But, if you're looking for a traditional guacamole.. this isn't it. This was pieces of avocado with black beans, corns, and peppers. I enjoyed it.. but the hubby hatessss beans. It's already prepared with the beans so it's not like you can have it without it. I thought the pizza had great flavor.. it's one of their newer items on the menu. But, it was bit chewy and I would've preferred it to be crispier. It came with a side of insanely spicy salsa. Seriously, the manager was walking around and she noticed we ordered this pizza and she asked if we'd tried the salsa yet. We had and our mouths were on fireee!! She said that for her it's too spicy also but other customers love it. The salsa did have great flavor but I couldn't have more than a drop on my pizza.  Truth is... I really came in here for the Red Velvet cake. I've had it before and I secretly just wanted to come here for the cake. But I couldn't tell my husband that. :) If you don't come here for the food.. come for the cake!

The people next to us came after us and got their food before us, and we didn't even ask for freshly harvested avocados from South America! It was Carnitas Tacos! The ugly: 5. The food, when it arrived had burnt pork in it... no, not ""slow roasted"", but chunks of ""give your jaws a workout"" pieces of what looked like scrapings from an oven that was running too long.

The service was friendly and prompt. I thought it was weird that the menu said you had to ask for bread but we didn't, they just brought it out. The pepperoni pizzas from the kid's menu was just right for our boys. My husband and I ordered sandwiches. I liked that they came with soup or salad rather than fries.

It has everything I like, and it was tasty. I only had 3 pieces because it's super filling. I also tried the salted caramel pudding, which was odd to me at first because I never had salted caramel pudding before, but it warmed up to me.

55,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",2,12,7.0,1.0,2013-03-20,"My friend and I waited for a good couple of minutes at the hostess station before we were even greeted. Once we sat down we waited even longer for a server to come and take our drink order. By the time Calli, our server even showed up, we knew what we wanted to drink and eat. My BBQ chicken pizza was Luke warm, the chicken was cold, and it seemed to have been cooked and then placed under heating lamps for quite some time, waiting for someone to come along and to order it. Calli walked past our table multiple times, ignoring us it seemed like. I had finished my water soon after we got our food, and put the glass at the edge of the table indicating that I needed more. Calli walking past it multiple times did not EVER offer to refill my glass. I had to finish my meal, with the only thing to drink was the ice I had to chew on.  When it came to the bill, which took a lifetime to receive, we had to make sure we received the right one! The table behind us received not only the wrong bill from Calli, but when Calli took it back to give the, the right bill, she said out loud, ""It does not make a difference if you get their bill or yours!"" I was appalled to hear that! Not only did she say it to the guests but she said it out loud in the middle of the restaurant!  This was my first and very last time ever at CPK. I am very disappointed in the lack of taste in the food, but appalled by the service of the staff!

45,Bill M.,"Abington, MA",30,126,22.0,3.0,2013-11-20,"I was less than impressed with California Pizza Kitchen. My wife and I shared a Caesar salad and a works pizza. Lettuce in the salad was fresh and crisp, and topped with freshly shaved cheese and an average Caesar dressing. Would have been a good Caesar salad except for one thing: NO CROUTONS! Major oversight. Toppings on the pizza were good, but crust was a little underdone, doughy, and bland. Our server was very friendly, although I specifically had to flag her down and ask for a refill on mine and my wife's drinks despite two ""walk-bys"" with our empty glasses on the table. Christmas music playing on the background ""Muzak"" system was strange. I love Christmas as much as the next person. But I don't believe in playing Christmas music 2 weeks before Thanksgiving. Granted, it wasn't all Christmas music..just a couple songs in the overall mix..but still weird and way too early. The place is okay, but not great.

Apparently the manager told our waitress to take a break and forgot to tell her she had a table. The manager never said sorry and never even said a word to use. Our waitress Jackie was so sorry for the restaurant not telling her she had a table, Jackie was an amazing waitress and she was a great addition to the staff.

After telling the waiter multiple times to bring in more bread they finally bought out 3 plates for the party. After waiting for 30 more mins the main course started to come out one by one. Most of the folks ended up not enjoying what they ordered. The pizzas were every pale. I ordered a California club with chicken and Mediterranean salad with chicken topping. They bought out the sandwich with turkey. After I asked the waiter to check the order he insisted that the sandwich had chicken and bought out a piece of both meats to show me that both meats look the same.

26,Amanda R.,"Easton, MA",245,149,798.0,3.0,2015-12-05,"I've honestly experienced better food elsewhere, sorry to say. I have had better pizzas, salads and pastas at other chain restaurants and local mom and pop restaurants. However, their appetizers and desserts are worth trying. Starters: Try the small plate of the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadillas.  The ranchito sauce that comes on the side is on the milder scale and pairs well. The quesadillas have cilantro, black beans, roasted peppers, lime chicken, Monterey Jack cheese and caramelized onions. Get this:  It's baked, not panini pressed! I tried the Sesame Chicken Ginger Dumplings two nights ago and wow, I wanted more! The secret's out...I really like dumplings and ginger and I'm glad those two go well together.  Soy-Ginger Chili sauce comes on the side with those lovely dumplings and it's big enough to share. If you're getting the lunch combo, add these to complete your meal...you won't go wrong.  Pizza: I tried the California Veggie pizza and was disappointed. The veggies were really dry and there wasn't enough sauce on the pizza. The sun-dried tomatoes aren't a nice touch either. To me, the crust on CPK'S pizzas is dry and tasteless. Salads: I can't do it! There are way to many toppings to sift through and I really couldn't enjoy my salad. I got the Thai Crunch Chicken Salad, but without avocado. There were more rice sticks than veggies. The highlight was the Thai peanut dressing and the edamame.  Pastas: I got the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with both chicken and shrimp. All that I tasted was cream. I had to add black pepper and salt to give it a pasta lift. Also, the dish was extremely oily.  Desserts: The Pumpkin Cheesecake was bitter and has way to many spices for a pumpkin cheesecake.  It gave me a headache and it's a humungous slice.  The praline sauce drizzled on top of it and at the bottom made it taste even worse. I have a fix for that.  Try the Butter Cake with or without ice cream, your choice!  You will really LOVE this dessert because it's sweet and not too heavy.  I get it all the time when I go.  Sorry CPK, I'll come back just for appetizers and for the Butter Cake dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.444,3.4000000000000004

Service was okay, we had to repeat our orders to the waiter a couple of times. However, he was very nice, so I'll give him a break. California cobb salad- This was okay. The salad came 5 minutes after we ordered it. There isn't dressing on the salad, but it comes with a side of blue cheese. The lettuce tasted kind of old, the other parts were just okay. I don't think I'd order it again. Garlic creme fettuccine- We got chicken with this, and I'd ordered it before on a previous visit. I liked this a lot, especially the chicken. However, it is a heavier lunch, because of the thick cream and whatnot.  We also tried some of their desserts. Wouldn't recommend. They didn't have a lot of choices, probably 6 things were available. Smores dessert- basically marshmallows and chocolate pudding. Not worth it. The marshmallows in the picture were melted but that wasn't the case on the real thing. The chocolate pudding was sickening sweet. My friend found a little plastic thing (almost like a wire?) in the pudding, and we told the waiter. The manager came over and apologized and took the item off the check.  Belgium chocolate souffle cake- The plate didn't look clean. That was the first thing I noticed. Around the edges, there were some stains. Ugh. The cake itself was not that great. It, again, was sickening sweet. We couldn't finish it.  Food here is below average.

We could not believe that the server was unsure about whether or not a certain dish contained nuts. Luckily, she asked once more with the manager before consuming it and he then confirmed yes the dish had nuts, HOWEVER this did not happen until we had already ordered, waited for the food and it was sitting in front of her.  After we confirmed this, my friend was able to order something else that was confirmed to not have nuts in it and the dish was taken off the bill. Good, fine, great. Meal goes on and everything is fine. However, upon receiving the bill, we found that she had been charged for the new dish she ordered, which we were under the impression had been taken care of. I was blown away and could not get over how much their management did not understand the severity of the situation. In this case, the replacement dish my friend got SHOULD of been on the house regardless since they nearly served my friend a dish that could of sent her to the hospital.  After receiving my bill and informing the server that we disagreed with the bill and wanted my friend's entree comped (not the whole bill, just that one dish!) they looked at us like we were crazy and gave us major attitude back, stating, ""Well, we gave you the first dish for free..."" You mean you gave the dish that could of hospitalized because your server couldn't say for sure whether there were nuts in it or not? You're giving that for free now? My friend and I were absolutely shocked and immediately asked to speak to the server's manager.  Then, the manager came over and the same thing....""Well we comped your first dish for free, and we can take maybe $10 off."" Thank you CPK, I'm glad you care about your customer's safety and well-being so much! After more arguing, the manager FINALLY offered a free dessert as well to help fix the problem. At that point we were so done and wanted to leave the restaurant we accepted, ate the dessert as fast as possible and left.

Had such an amazing time, and the food is always perfect. Probably the only 'chain' restaurant that is worth going to these days. Highly Recommend!

21,Wai W.,"Quincy, MA",7,98,160.0,2.0,2017-10-06,"second and last time again...first time was a decade ago and experience was not great that I can actually remembered,  so I should have known better, but since a different location and time had past, you think this Chain would improve, but I proof to be correct, not worth my money and time. service - eh, host are too casual as they just chilling at host stand.  because they say me at 2nd table near entrance when there were other tables within restaurant.  other staff chill up at host stand too.  waitress was your average chain restaurant service, forgets our request and cannot get another drink as she disappears.  she was also in no rush to serve. food - not worth the money.  my chicken pasta has tiny chucks, barely any really, so I asked for more, and waitress brought to me on a condiment plate, so it can hold more tiny chunks.  probably shipped in packages to chains instead of breast portion.  at least cut into slices and place on top of dish.   pizza was worst than your local pizza shops. Decor-  improved as years gone by, your average chain restaurant decor. not sure why my sister-in-law keeps coming, but ends for me.  I rather go to cheesecake factory for more food at same or lower price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
20,Chaya B.,"Dover, MA",27,64,2.0,4.0,2017-12-27,"It's a lot better than I remember. Have not tried the pizza again got sick years ago. However the Asian salad yummy but a bit pricey $20.00 for a large. Had the steak decent, cooked perfect and not over seasoned. The best part was the service, boy was my waitress on top of me. In a good way, not hovering but on point. I've used take out there as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
