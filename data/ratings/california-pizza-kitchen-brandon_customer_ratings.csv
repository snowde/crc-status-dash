They recently added a new pizza, the Habanero Carnitas. I've had it the last two times now. I love it. We came at a slow time of day. The service was adequate. It did take a while for our meal to arrive which made me wonder how long it takes on a busy day. Based on other reviews it appears that service is an issue for this location.The bathrooms were very clean.

61,Scott H.,"Clearwater, United States",129,187,230.0,3.0,2013-01-12,"Since I had been visiting the International Plaza for several weeks now I had been wanting to try the California Pizza Kitchen. This location is not in the food court or in the Bay Street area; it is on the lower level next to Nordstroms.  I will have to say from the outside looking in it looks a lot smaller than it really is.  The setting is mostly booths suitable for a long narrow restaurant with a counter area that seats maybe 8 to 10 people.  The counter was extra helpful to me because there was a line for regular seating and the counter had available spots.  I find this as one of the benefits to dining alone when eating near an open kitchen likes this does take the edge of not having a conversation going. Sometimes my moods are kid like so I was really wanting just basic spaghetti and meat sauce with mushrooms added.  So I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese which was the outstanding part of my experience.  The noodles were al dente perfection holding a nice but delicate firmness.  The sauce had a composition balancing between the meat and the tomato not letting one over power the other.  The sauce was very hardy and leaned toward a peppery flavor (not a fan of the sweet sauces); with the hefty sliced mushrooms topped with parmesan and parsley my desire was being fulfilled. They offered a selection wine and beer.  I was impressed that my Guiness came in a 20oz bottle and I did not have to ask for a glass.  I did have to ask the waitress to open the bottle after trying to operate it like a twist off only to realize that it required a bottle opener; this and I had to ask for flatware were my only negative takes. I did notice a great deal of kids, after noticing some of the dishes I could see why, they looked very good especially the mac n cheese looking dish. If you are planning a trip to the mall and don't want to eat in the food court this is a great place for the entire family.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

44,Chelle S.,"Riverview, FL",0,5,,4.0,2016-09-04,Our family loves the environment as much as the food. We have been going here to eat for the last four years and we have found a waiter that we will wait to be seated just to make sure we are sitting in his section. Good service makes the food even better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

I like that the Westfield Brandon mall has several actual restaurants attached to the mall so you don't have to choose food court food or get in the car to go get food. We were quickly greeted and seated when we arrived and were given a booth in the corner by the takeout door. We had a stroller with us and needed a high chair so the extra room was appreciated, but we felt in the way when people actually came in through that door. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were delicious. The kids' pasta meals were also surprisingly good! I've become accustomed to not expect much from kids meals and they exceeded my expectation with the alfredo and mac n cheese. I was happy to find that they had SO much more than just pizza. I would definitely recommend this restaurant as well as this location!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0
