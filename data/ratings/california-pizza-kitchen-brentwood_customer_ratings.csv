26,Al L.,"North Hills, CA",0,21,,2.0,2012-10-17,"Two stars is problably appropriate.  Salad was so-so.  Their BBQ chicken salad used to be decent -- what I had the other day was kind of meh.  It needed extra BBQ sauce to be decent enough to actually eat. I must have been out of my mind, because I decided to order a fruit smoothie.  The smoothie was not worth drinking, and didn't actually have any fruit in it.  Fruit to CPK apparently means some sort of flavoring liquid with the name of a fruit on it's label that's poured into the drink you order.  Even Red Robin puts actual fruit in their drinks. After having not more than the top 1/4 inch of it, I pushed it away.  Later on in the meal the server made the mistake of asking us if we needed anything.  I told him I needed him to take the smoothie away and throw it in the trash. The GF and our guest both had pizzas, which apparently were OK but nothing spectacular.  Dessert, a chocolate something or other was pretty good.

I must say that the evening service here is so much better than the lunch service. I've never reviewed CPK before and I don't know why but last night the service and food were both great. We split a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza. The salad was decent but very little chicken and BBQ taste or dressing but the pizza was off the hook good. My usual fave is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza (and it is still one of the best on their menu) but someone turned me onto this Pear & Gorgonzola and OMG it's so delish! Surprisingly there were a several tables with young children at them out on the patio. My dog was more well behaved than they were as was another pup on the patio. I take control if my pup gets a little hyper while out and I wish more parents these days would do the same. I could never get away with that crap when I was a kid!!! Anyways... luckily we finished just as a large party with lots of very loud wee ones arrived.

I've eaten here a couple times, and had their food for work meetings about once a month.  The first time I've had food from this CPK was through delivery to work for a meeting. My food was alright, but there was hair in two of my co-worker's food.  Second time.. delivery again. Hair in another co-worker's food.  Other times... they seem to forget when we ask for ""extra of something,"" but when we ask to omit something, they tend to get that correct. Cheap, much? o.o Oh, they also skimp out on the full sized salads too. I was sad. The service has been around the same both times I've eaten at this CPK.

However, reduction of salt in their soups and other foods would be a very nice improvement.  Another improvement would be more selection of healthy and simple salads and bistro-type options on their appetizer menu (not the main meal menu), especially for the carb-conscious, and an adjustment in the high acidity of their salad dressings (that really matters).    Any remote town we're visiting, we look for CPK branches as a sure bet for decent quality meal that won't upset our stomach and would appease the kids as well.  It would also be nice to see this restaurant make available more local selections, drawing from local produce.  Those always seem to taste the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=100,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8960000000000004,3.0000000000000004

Location: Located on San Vicente Blvd, lunch time can be an absolute Bi&*h when it comes to parking...especially if you just want to get take out which leads me to the next section!! Parking: It's a killer especially at lunch trying to find parking of any kind. They do have a parking structure which is nice if you are looking to dine in BUT if you are like me and have to do take out or curbside...good luck. The problem is most of the time there is someone parked in the passenger loading zone which makes it incredibly hard to get your damn take out! It's unfortunately that CPK hasn't realized that they should have the curbside parking in the actual parking structure...it would just make things move a lot more smoothly. Food: When it comes to the food you can't go wrong with anything...and the butter cake is an absolute must order if you haven't had it before. When I have time to sit and relax for a second i like to have the Carribean Sunset Sangria while I wait and especially with this heat it's refreshing and alcoholic so yay!!!

The parking garage downstairs was quick and very easy. And, since it was so late, we didn't even get charged to park down there.  We had a tough time deciding what exactly it was that we wanted to eat, but our server Tyree was very patient, friendly, and helpful with suggestions. We ordered the split pea and barley soup, a barbecue chicken pizza, and a quinoa- arugula salad, which were all reasonably good. He was very attentive to our table and made sure that we had everything we needed including bread and some olive oil while we waited.   California Pizza Kitchen has definitely become a little bit more upscale over the years.  The night we were there, CPK was even offering a rib-eye steak entree as well as a grilled halibut entree.  We didn't order these, but it is nice to see the menu opening up further.

The service at this location is very professional and attentive.  Hey those actors have to start somewhere. The lunch duos consists of several choices. Select 7"" Pizza's or sandwiches combined with a soup or salad.  I opted for the following and it was the perfect sized lunch, well prepared and ""hit the spot"" good.

BBQ sauce, smoked Gouda, red onions and fresh cilantro.   SUPER SPINACH + QUINOA Crisp Granny Smith apples, marinated cranberries and spiced pecans with our house made Champagne vinaigrette.

When we first arrived they said it would be about a 20 minute wait.  While we were waiting, I overheard a waitress laughing that she had given food to the wrong table.  That was my first hint that dinner may not go smoothly.  Another party walked in and asked how long it would be and it seemed like the hostess was trying to say anything to get them to leave.  She kept saying - it's going to be a wait, the servers are really busy and trying to catch up.  I was pretty sheocked and how unprofessional and sad it was that they are so overwhelmed they are trying to get people to leave. Now if you've been there before, you know that it's a really dark restaurant.  Well we were seated at a table where the few light bulbs that existed above were all out.  I could barely see my menu (and i couldn't see my food at all when it arrived).  The tables next to us were empty, but completely dirty.  I've never seen a restaurant with so many empty, dirty tables before. I ordered a sprite and the waitress said ""sorry we are out of sprite"" Really?.  My father ordered a beer.  When the waitress brought our drinks, she clearly brought a different beer than what my father had ordered.  When asked, the waitress said they were out of the beer he ordered and she had brought a different one.  She barely knew the name of the beer she brought us and couldn't tell us if it was a wheat beer or not.  My father is allergic to wheat.  So after a google search of what the beer was, of course it was a wheat beer.  She wasn't even going to mention it was a different beer-- we had to figure out whether it would make my father sick or not.  For dinner, I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and the waitress said ""I'm sorry we are out of parmesan cheese."" A pizza place is out of cheese? Really? After a long wait, finally our food arrived.  The chicken in my salad came black and inedible.  The salad maybe had a small drop of dressing on it-- the salad was pretty much dry.  I couldn't even tell what salad they were trying to make.  It was really upsetting that we had to pay for this food, but I didn't want to make a scene when we were trying to have a nice family dinner. At the table next to us, a family with two small children were eating.  I overheard that the mothers meal also came black and burnt and inedible.  The waitress offered to remake it for her, but she said no thank you because their food took so long to come and the children needed to go to bed. My family and I decided-- as we love CPK-- we will never come to this location again.  Thanks but no thanks.  I can't believe such a popular famous restaurant could operate like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=20,2.76,3.09,3.09,2.5640000000000005,2.9579999999999997

The servers are always friendly and attentive, and the menu has a pretty wide variety of food. I usually get the BBQ chicken pizza or the chopped salad. It's upstairs in this outdoor shopping plaza, and has indoor and outdoor seating.

I always ask for Pizza. They had new thing called Shrimp Scampi Pizza which is housemade lemon-garlic shrimp with caramelized onion, Mozzarella, Parmesan and red chili, topped with fresh arugula and wild Greek Oregon, and it was delicious just like its name.  I asked for their freshly puréed pineapple & cucumber with monin cucumber, fresh torn mint and agave sour, topped with club soda it was refreshing and tasty. Our waiter was very nice and he kept checking on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood,2.96,2.98,2.98,,2.972

94,Donna R.,"Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, CA",85,171,98.0,4.0,2017-12-02,CPK has always been the place for the reasonably priced healthy salad. However today I realized they have a new menu. The price of salads have Increased Significantly. The chicken is now considered an add on for an additional $4.50. Bringing the price up to approximately $18.50 for a half size salad. Way Too expensive for me.  I decided to order a pizza. I looked all over the menu and found the pizzas hiding under a fold down flap. The other entrees are priced above $22.00.  The service is always excellent but the prices are beyond my budget.  Check out the screenshot of the salad menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood,3.2,3.03,3.03,,3.098
