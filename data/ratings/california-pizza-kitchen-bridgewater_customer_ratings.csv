53,pranay b.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",22,28,,4.0,2012-03-19,"I'm sorry for the blatant thievery.  We are good parents, I swear.  We try to teach them the right things like try pooping in the potty, don't eat the toothpaste, and don't go running around without diapers.  But, toddlers will be toddlers.  So, in a very public apology, I'm sorry that our toddler took the crayons.  It was rather ambiguous whether they were meant to be returned, taken home, or thrown around in the restaurant.  Just be glad the toddler didn't practice her ABCs on your walls.  Or maybe she did---who knows, I was nose deep in the Sam Adams.   Remember the first time we ever met?  It was 15 years ago.  You were naive and fresh.  I was still single.  You had these spunky innovative creations like adding pear and gorgonzola on a pizza.  Fifteen years past, and a mortgage and a kid later, you still wow me.  Not with your innovative creations, but the free crayons and the ability to keep diaper wearing customers occupied.  How you've evolved from the innovative California free spirit to a place that serves crayons with your food.   Tonight, you provided us a pizza with Japanese egglpant, peppers, and red onions.  As expected---good like always.   And our toddler---a buttery noodle dish that would cause individuals like me to go through a quadruple stent bypass.  And the $1 dessert....now, that truly is wowing.  The financial person in me wonders if you even make money on selling it for a $1.  Of course, it was all whipped cream and pieces of M&Ms, with barely a spoon of ice cream...but, that was probably a good thing, since the sugar-crayon combination can make the toddler go haywire.   We'll be back, like always----toddler in tow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater?start=60,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

60,Ralph F.,"Paramus, NJ",0,9,,1.0,2012-05-15,"Worst CPK I have ever been to. Almost half of the restaurant had empty tables but they could not sit us right away because they were understaffed with only 3 waiters serving the entire place! While we were waiting, they lost the business of a total of 8 other customers who refused to wait. Their business could have afforded you to schedule another waiter! The maitre'd was a rude man who stood around just waiting for other customers to disappoint. Why not be proactive and help the other staff instead of doing nothing? By the time we got seated, the table was not fully clean. Our waitress, although very nice, was serving a third of all customers so the service was very slow.

We have gone a few times and it was never spectacular so I'm not sure why we ever went back but his parents wanted to go again and that will be our last visit. For once, the waitress wasn't that great, yes she was nice, but our appetizers came out before our drinks even came. How is that possible? Because it means you're slacking. No it wasn't even busy there so I can't even give her that excuse. The hummus appetizer was pretty good, decent I would say. His parents enjoyed their salads and dessert was decent, same as any chain dessert. Now why the 1 star? I ordered garlic cream fettuccine with mushrooms and broccoli, which by the way isn't broccoli florets, more like broccolini and he ordered the vegetarian pizza with no cheese. Because we're vegetarian. Sounds easy.. it didn't taste terrible, pretty good.. and what do I find? CHICKEN! SERIOUSLY CHICKEN!?!?!?!? I didn't order chicken! And he found BACON! Yes, BACON on a VEG-E-TAR-IAN pizza. BIG problem. I was mortified by this and when the waitress came we told her and she apologized saying that she was going to get her manager. Well when you have a problem like that you get your manager RIGHT AWAY, not serve other tables and get drinks and then find her. NO. The manager apologized and asked if we wanted new meals, why would we? You just made me sick to my stomach. She gave us free desserts, took our meals off, and gave us coupons to come back.. which is VERY doubtful.

The bar adds a nice touch to the mall dining experience. The problem is the food. The Tortilla soup was without flavor. The angel hair w/ tomato basil was dry and tasteless as well. Most egregious of all, the pizza was lousy. Despite having a brick oven on premise, the crust was soggy and limp. The sauce was an even greater offender and couldnt even pass muster with our 8 year old. They even served tasteless Arnie Palmers.

59,J M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2012-12-03,"Summary: Terrible seating policy; Manager/hostess humiliate customers  We were here in a group of 5 (incl. 3 children) on Saturday night for dinner. After a long wait we were seated, 45 minutes later. Given the long wait and hungry children we decided to try a table of 4. Realizing it was too cramped, we requested the next available suitable sized table only minutes after being seated. We were at first informed that couldn't be done since we were already seated! Reluctantly the hostess agreed after persuasion. After a while when nobody came around to get us while seeing larger tables opening up, we checked in at the front. We were told to seat ourselves at a table that the hostess pointed to from afar. We thought this was rude and discourteous though decided to not make a big deal.  As we walked over to the other table (kids and water cups in tow), we were confronted by the Manager in the middle of the restaurant. It was awkward to be standing holding water cups in the midst of narrow tables, and being humiliated by the Manager. Quoting the Manager - ""I train my staff well enough and doubt that they would tell you can change to another table. From what I understand you agreed to sit at a table of 4. Keep in mind once you are seated we do not allow customers to change tables!""  We informed him that we were changing tables based on their hostess' guidance and that he should perhaps clarify with her first. We felt an apology (after seeking necessary clarifications) was in order. But, no apologies or amends were forthcoming! The Manager was argumentative and defensive. He failed to address our problem in a satisfactory manner. We stayed because it would be unfair to our hungry children to leave without any dinner but we (regular customers at this restaurant) felt so humiliated and will not bring our business here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater?start=60,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006

Decorated in dark colors with attractive wood decorative pieces on the ceiling, CPK has some nice big booths to sit in as well as tables.  CPK adopts the ""open kitchen/kitchen as theater"" philosophy where you can watch the food being prepared including the pizza oven complete with dramatic flame lit up.  If you really want to get close to the kitchen you can sit at the bar which faces the kitchen directly.

The salads were both delicious though the arugula was less peppery than expected.  The cobb was super tasty and the bacon they used in it was super tasty and smokey. The pizzas were, much to my surprise, super tasty!  The mushroom pizza had a wonderful, Earthy flavor to it thanks to the cheese and mushroom combination.  The Korean pizza was flavorful with a nice tang thanks to the slaw on top.  The honey wheat whole wheat dough was tasty, chewy and warm with no sogginess from the sauce and cheese.   I really enjoyed my time at California Pizza Kitchen.  One minor note, one of our silverware settings was dirty so we had to have it replaced, but that's hardly a deal breaker.  I was very happy with my first ""CPK"" experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater?start=40,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006

Its got a great combination of fresh veggies that serves as a semi-hybrid between a pizza and a taco, and in all, is definitely 'good eats.' Picking up at this CPK is super easy, thanks to the reserved parking spots right in front of the entrance (it's at a mall), and I got my pizzas and was home in no time. Unfortunately, after coming home, we noticed that the Tostada Pizza was devoid of all the great toppings, so it was just a bean spread and cheese pizza, and with the weather outside being nasty, were in no mood to trek all the way back. I called in and they had me speak to a manager, who apologized and offered right away to refund the pizza to our gift card. While that didn't quite work out due to a technical issue on CPK's end, a different manager, Megan, really demonstrated exceptional customer service and offered to mail out an equivalent gift card to us right away, all the while apologizing and explaining how she was just looking to ensure that we were happy.

The food was okay, service was friendly and the price was rather expensive. My fiance and I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza with bacon because that's what they're famous for and frankly I didn't know what else to order. The pizza was decent but very small and kind of expensive. If you're really hungry, I would almost suggest ordering 2 pizzas for 2 people but you're probably looking at around 13-15 bucks for a pizza slightly larger than a personal. The place is okay for lunch or a casual dinner if your hanging out at the mall but don't go out of your way to eat here. The best thing though is the crispy bacon.

Server asked if we'd been before, and when I said no, she suggested that their pizzas were ""personal"" size, and that we should definitely order 1 per person. This was overkill; no one could eat more than 2/3 of theirs, and our party included a teenage athlete. We started with the white corn guacamole. It came with disappointing cardboardy chips, but the guac itself was fantastic, about 50/50 avocado/corn with some cilantro, pepper, and jicama thrown in.  I had a half order of the Thai Crunch salad with avocado. It was perfectly serviceable, but not mindblowing. I am not sure how a person could eat a full order -- I could not finish the half and I am not a dainty eater. I like my salads lightly dressed and this one was. I imagine if you prefer a normal/heavily dressed salad, you would probably want to ask for extra. All of the pizzas at our table were the regular ""hand tossed"" ones.

Thai Chicken Pizza was decent. A nice crispy taste from the green onions, bean sprouts. Flavor was nice.  The Hawaiian Pizza was good. A good sweet taste. Wish they cut the pineapple into smaller pieces because they were huge.  The Pesto Cream Pasta was alright. Creamy and decent taste.  Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower was quite delicious. Healthy version than having chicken wings. Good spicy flavor.  Chips and guacamole was okay.  Would come back only if I was hungry while shopping inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
18,Dianne A.,"Allentown, PA",81,10,2.0,2.0,2017-01-09,First I have to say that this is one of the dirtiest California Pizza kitchen.   Our visit started with being seated at a dirty table which we had to remind the waitress to clean.   I needed to use the ladies room.  When I opened the door there was garbage all over the sink and the floor.  The Glass doors and windows were filthy with fingerprints all over them.  Yuck!   I should have walked the other way but I was starving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
6,Cody O.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",141,145,208.0,4.0,2017-01-18,"The California Pizza Kitchen is located on the ground floor of the Bridgewater Commons Mall. It's nearby one of the entrances, and thus close to a parking lot for easy access. This establishment, in addition to pizzas, has a variety of cocktails and a decent wine selection. The bread that came with the meal was soft and warm with a pleasant taste when dipped in the oil seasoning. The plain pizza was decent, featuring fresh cheese and pretty standard tomato sauce. The crust and bread used for the pizza didn't stand out too much and was relatively lacking in flavor.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza, while not much of a pizza, was very good. There was a bit of cheese, though not much, and no tomato sauce. Instead of tomato sauce, a delicious barbeque sauce was used instead and onions and parsley were added in addition to the chicken for flavor. The chicken was tender and not dry in the slightest and the overall product was delicious. Overall, this establishment is a decent option for food if one finds them self famished after a long day of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
21,Charles V.,"Raritan, NJ",36,41,,4.0,2017-01-23,"I like California Pizza kitchen.  Some of their prices could be a little lower, and I never order drinks due to the price.  Their regular menu includes lunch offerings, but we always come around dinner time. I often find I wish I could select something from their lunch menu, but alas, the time.  I like their sandwiches and their soup, usually I get the pea soup or the potato soup.  They have some interesting personal pie choices that are good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

I sat in full view of the kitchen and could see the chef making our food. Really clean kitchen. The manager came to our table to check and see if everything was up to our standards on both visits. He remembered us and was very happy to see we visited the again, I liked that he remembered!  I requested a pizza my way which was not on the menu, Avocado, arugula pizza and boy was it delicious!

After tasting this freshly made Sicilian pizza, it was well worth the 30 mins wait.

When asked to speak to the manage the experience didn't get any better. He wasn't apologetic and didn't offer to make the situation, simply asked if he can re heat our food. If it took an hour for our first meal, one can only imagine how long it'll take for a refire. I will not be coming to location anymore.

3,Enya G.,"Edison, NJ",476,70,91.0,3.0,2017-08-10,"Food: we got the avocado egg rolls, chicken chipotle pizza and shrimp zucchini scampi. The avocado egg rolls were good but on the saltier side because of the bacon (? Not sure if there bacon but I tasted it). The chicken chipotle pizza was interesting. It basically had Mexican toppings on it like beans and tomato and onion. It came with the chipotle sauce on the side which was good because it was pretty spicy so you could adjust how much you wanted on it the shrimp zucchini scampi was not what I expected. It was linguine pasta with an oil based sauce instead of a creamy sauce. It definitely leaned towards the healthier side.  Price: around $50 for all three items. Sorry I don't have the breakdown  Service: good service. Basically all the things we ordered were recommended by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful.  Overall, I think I'd come back again to get the other pizzas. I don't think I'll order any pasta dish next time. After all, it's called California pizza kitchen so I'll stick with the pizza",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

2,Bianca L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,13,1.0,5.0,2017-09-25,"I went in with low expectations, to be quite honest. I personally was advocating for Chipotle, but my family was adamant.  Our server was so sweet! Honestly one of the nicest servers I've ever had-- might have been the nicest. He gave me the recommendation to get this Mexican tortilla soup-- I've never tasted anything like it! It was so flavorful and unique. Lunch was absolutely great!  The pizzas are all absolutely to die for. My personal favorite was the pear-arugula-some crumbly cheese and the Mexican tortilla one. The Margarita was also great and simple. You really can't go wrong with any of the pizza Make sure to save room for desert! Butter cake, as I'm sure you'll here from your waiter, is a restaurant favorite, and for good reason! The chocolate mousse is something I wouldn't skip out on either.  A multitude of vegetarian options, too, which is always a plus!  Definitely will be returning, and it doesn't hurt that it's in the mall either ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bridgewater,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

Rather large with central bar seating and several dining tables. Charred shishitto peppers were - hmm actually charred and well-done! Another good veggie app is Buffalo cauliflower. Cauli battered and deep fried. Both the apps were good. The house bread with olive oil was ok but not remarkable or signaturish.  California  veggie with goat cheese pizza was average. While the crust was crisp and charred- the wheat dough did not appear too fresh. Same story with the the spinach and artichokes pizza. Garlic creme fettuccini pasta was a little bit bland.
