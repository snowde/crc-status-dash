35,Nicole C.,"Brighton, CO",6,245,97.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"My husband and I came here on a date recently. I haven't been to CPK since I was a kid. I intended to order a sandwich or salad but we both ended up ordering pizza. All the pizza choices were overwhelming and they all sounded so good. The pizzas are one size (about the size of a big plate with 6 small slices). He ordered the new habanero carnitas pizza and I order the Greek pizza. We both really enjoyed our meals. (His was very spicy and mine was refreshing and a great mix of a warm pizza and cold greek salad.) He finished my pizza for me and was glad to, to tone down the heat of his pizza.  I also ordered a peach Italian soda, which was very yummy and has free refills. The only reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is because of the price. The pizzas are good but not $14 a piece good. Especially since a lot of their toppings are pre-prepared (like the greek salad) meaning you can't customize your pizza by asking for no tomatoes in the salad, no onion, etc. If the meals were around $10 it would be more worth it. We'll come back just not very often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield?start=20,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

It took a couple of minutes of us standing awkwardly with our shopping bags at the hostess stand before we were seated. I was slightly worried that this would reflect how the rest of the experience went. Happily, it didn't. Our server (Danielle, I think?) was fantastic and super attentive. She always made sure our drinks were filled and made some great recommendations for us. I got the kung pow spaghetti with shrimp and it was SOOOO good. I would bathe in it if I could. It was all I could do not to lick the bowl. One of my companions ordered the same thing and the other (the black sheep dare I say?) got the Jambalaya pasta.

26,Connor L.,"Portland, OR",621,145,215.0,3.0,2013-10-06,"Today the girls and I decided to go for some food and shopping in Flatirons. We walked in the entrance smelled and spied CPK and all agreed we were starving.  It was Sunday with a big football game on the tube so the restaurant was pretty much empty. We were immediately seated and got out beverages. Didn't take us long to decide what to eat either. Our food came out quickly as ordered; we were good. We had food in front of us. Each of us was about halfway through our entree, happily eating and chatting away when out server Danielle appeared again. She asked if we wanted to go boxes and containers for our food and didn't really wait for our answer. She walked away and the four of us kinda looked at each other in confusion. She came back about three mins later and asked how we wanted to split our bill. We were all a bit tongued tied, ""Did we say we were ready for our bill or to go?"" We were clearly still eating especially me the world's slowest eater.  We sorted the bill but continued to eat and chat. Danielle never once offered us water or refills on beverages. She didn't come to see if we wanted anything else while we contained to sit and chat. We finally flagged down some other server to get a dessert order placed and to get some water for our table.  Danielle did bring us our dessert when it was done and waters an disappeared again. Once more as we continued to eat our dessert and were not even halfway through she appeared again no to see how we were doing but to get us boxes and our new check.  While we did enjoy our food the service was nothing but disappointing. Danielle was only interested in whatever was going on with her cell phone. We constantly watched her checking it while trying to flag her down for things like water. Her attention to her only table -us- was laughable.

We also ordered a slice of their red velvet cake -- talk about heavenly! We were also never short on drink refills, and despite the bartender being overwhelmed with the crowd, he never lost his cool. It kinda took him a while to realize we wanted our check picked up, but once he did (again, benefit of the doubt due to the crowd) it was taken care of quickly. Bonus? The pizza reheated well.

It was spicy and tasty and reheated awesome the next day. I kinda forgot how good this place is, the basic pizzas are $14 each which I think is pricey for lunch.  Our server was kind, but very forgetful,  My water glass was refilled only once and my niece's chocolate milk was never refilled after she requested one.

He was charming, engaging, and constantly following up to be certain his guests were well taken care of. I've run restaurants and frankly, I was impressed. He asked how we were doing when we came in and I replied, OK. He responded, ""Just OK?"" I said, ""Yes but hopefully the dining experience with you guys will change all of that."" He took me up on my challenge seating us himself. We had our drink order taken and delivered promptly and help with the menu. Shortly after the drinks arrived, our manager arrived with a sample of the thyme gorgonzola focaccia - excellent btw...  Our pizzas arrived on time. The topping distribution was not bad although, an equal amount of each topping was definitely not available from each slice. On the flip-side, the pizza itself tasted great. We had the meat lovers on the thin crust with mushrooms. Most of the time I bring leftovers home and leave them to the kids. Today, I guarded them zealously! The place was reasonably clean given a lunch rush however, the bathrooms needed some work. There were used paper towels on the floor and the vanity needed to be wiped down. Aside from that though, they were clean - no grease creeping out from the corners.

But the many people that have a god or great experience often are too busy to give them 4 or 5 stars.  On a briskly busy Friday night I sat at the counter. I was immediately greeted by Destiny who gave friendly and attentive service.  I got the thin crust sausage and mushroom pizza. It was delivered in less than 10 minutes and was delicious. I asked for a taste of a beer on tap but ordered Coors light in a bottle instead.  Any downside? Just the wimpy parents too afraid to tell their toddler NOT to incessantly bang the fork in the plate like a drum. And scream with their outside voice instead of their inside voice.

I wasn't interested in their flat breads, small plates, appetizers, but the poke bowls? We hardly even carry poke bowl restaurants in Denver, so I was incredibly shocked that California Pizza Kitchen even had it in its menu. But nonetheless, I was very excited too!!  Bring the Banh Mi Bowl on! Tina, our server, had described that the Banh Mi Poke Bowl was constantly ordered and very popular. I was definitely seeing my guy love his pizza, but my Banh Mi Poke Bowl looked like a very big, tossed salad with cold chicken, veggies, and not really anything else. A bit of ""poke"" (The seeds) but nothing else. I was wondering what was going on. I was trying to work with it, but I kinda gave up. I had a small cup of sauce and that did not even cover anything so I asked for two more little sauce cups. I flagged down Tina and asked for it to be sent back.

The pizza was just okay, the lettuce in the salad was wilted. This experience won't be repeated when I need to go to the mall again I will eat before I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

Forgot our appetizer, didn't have the soup we wanted and was told 30 minuites after we ordered, didn't give us silverware, felt ignored. Won't be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
3,Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",688,451,294.0,3.0,2018-01-08,This is a good lunch option if your walking the mall and need a break from the shopping. The food is fine for lunch on the go. The service was friendly and the prices are fair. I'd stop by again at lunch time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
