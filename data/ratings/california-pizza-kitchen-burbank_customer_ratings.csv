Don't get me wrong he was good but he messed up on my friends order.  To bad he just did not write it down. Cause if she was allergic to tomato, which she requested none then they would have had to redo the order and throw away and be wasteful.  One plus is when the people waited a server came around and offered BBQ Thai pizza so we don't get all grumpy I guess. Good Job on that. And the hostess made sure we were not forgotten since everyone else was being seated. They were just making room for a table for 5. And she also apologized when we left. Thank you! We had: -The Original BBQ chicken chopped = Delish -Garlic cream fettuccine (with mushroom) = delish but some noodles needed to be cooked a little longer. -Grilled chicken Caesar = my friend said it was good.  -kids spaghetti with regular pasta = looked good my daughter ate most of it. -Chocolate souffle cake = looked good but it so looked like all the ice cream melted all around it.  -Tiramisu = not bad totally could taste the Rum.

The waiter informed me that the carnitas pizza is exactly the same as the carne asada was except the meat is different. That doesn't work for me...I'm allergic to pork. So, I went with my second favorite, the Jamaican Jerk. Great flavors and a bit spicy.  I was disappointed the menus are card stock material now and we didn't get any bread and butter. I guess you have to ask for it but I've never had to in the past. On a Friday evening the wait was about 30 minutes, very crowded.

I saw the picture of the tiramisu on Yelp, and I was like 'i've got to try that, that look really good.' and what do you know, i'm in love!  The best beverage drink here, is the mango iced-tea.

172,Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"Yet another awesome restaurant chain that's going down the tubes. At least in my opinion.  It had been a few years since I'd dined here last and things have just....changed. Not for the better but whatever.  Parking is free unlike the Glendale location. I don't care if it's free 90 min parking there, we all know we stay there longer than that. Parking is okay here unless it's super busy, then it really is a drag.  Don't ever sit in the back near the revolving door that leads to the patio. Everyone loves walking in and out of that door, and it's cold!  Since when does a restaurant charge for fresh Parmesan cheese?! If I'm gonna spend more than ten bucks for one of your over priced pizzas or pastas, I'd like to have real Parmesan cheese on that. Not the processed Kraft brand that they put in a shaker. I think that's so damn tacky.  Bread is brought upon request. I get that because a lot of people don't eat any and they can't reuse it. But if you're gonna bring bread to my table make sure it's fresh. My mom and I had one slice each and nixed the rest of it.  Peach iced tea was soooo good. It's already sweetened but it still needs a bit more sweetener and a few lemons. I really enjoyed it.  I got the chopped chicken pizza. Also really liked that, but didn't like the dollar extra for the Parmesan.  When this place is really busy don't count on getting too much from your waiter. At least we didn't from ours. The manager really had to help him out, I sort of got a weird vibe from him that my request for a refill was really taking him out of his way.  Maybe I just came on a bad day, who knows. You can't say that their food lacks quality and isn't really good.

272,Sebastian P.,"San Jose, CA",18,36,,4.0,2012-04-20,My girlfriend and I have been to this location a few times now and went this morning for an 11oclock lunch. We ordered a Chinese chicken salad and the BBQ pizza. Until this morning the service visiting this location has been pretty good. I was not happy with the service today as the waitress seemed stand offish and not really friendly at all - probably a 4 out of 10 on the friendly scale. We were the first to be seated this morning and I would have thought go everyone's morning / fresh attitude. The food was CPK standard quality. We had to ask for rolls with butter. We did have Parmesan cheese was offered to us and we accepted and I noticed no extra charge on the bill for it. The music was really loud in the place today as well but they did oblige us by turning it down slightly. All in all the service and food is usually pretty good. Nothing amazing here though.

It seems also, that every time I find something I love, they discontinue it.  Some of the things I loved: Rosemary Potato Pizza, Miso shrimp & crab salad, Pear & Gorgonzola  Pizza (they discontinued it once, brought it back, then discontinued it again, only to bring it back with a ""better"" recipe) They even stopped giving the bread and butter as an appetizer.

Many of the employees at the Burbank location have been there for years which is a good sign.  CPK has been around a long time and continues to survive by providing what folks want at a decent price.   The 3 of us shared the avocado rolls (deep fried with bacon - geez!), half moroccan chicken salad and The Works pizza on thin crust and had a couple beers and got out of there for $50 including tip.  And we sat and chatted for a couple hours.   It's across the street from IKEA and Burbank Media Center so there's plenty to see if you like to stroll.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=240,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3760000000000003,3.5200000000000005

355,Christina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,42,,4.0,2012-06-23,"CPK is one of the few chain restaurants that I will eat at.  I admit that I am a bit of a food snob though I will eat at a 5 Star restaurant as well as a dive & anywhere in between so long as the food is good.  My favorite here is the  Wild Mushroom Pizza   on Honey Wheat Crust w/ Sun Dried Tomatoes  Cremini, Shiitake, Portobello, White Mushrooms, Fontina, Mozzarella cheeses w/ a wild mushroom walnut pesto, garnished with chopped Italian parsley to which I add a ton of crushed red peppers & enjoy with a glass or 2 of Pinot Grigio. I love this pizza so much that I never order anything else!!! I am quite picky about my pizza, being from Manhattan aka New York & I do give a thumbs up.  There was one manager who was very friendly & made sure that everyone was happy. I didn't see him the last time that I was there. If I knew his name I would give proper credit. I love when they give you the coupons for future visits to save anywhere from 10% to 20% off food only. I've been lucky to receive these on occasion. My only advice for the waitresses/waiters would be to make sure that water glasses are filled. I know that it's a very busy job, having been a waitress for a brief time but please keep the water glass full. I always did! :-) It's not pleasant to keep asking for water or to sit there with an empty glass thirsty.  I almost always tip 20% or more but the last time I was there I left the waitress a 15% tip, which is not like me. She didn't fill our water glasses & only seemed to be around to offer dessert or other items in an obvious attempt to increase her tip. It had the reverse affect as we felt that she did not care otherwise.  Most of my experiences here are positive.  The hosts & hostesses are usually wonderful! The passion fruit mojito is delicious! Before or after, you can go shopping in the mall or to IKEA, have a margarita at Chevy's or see a movie. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=300,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.2800000000000002,3.5600000000000005

152,Ailyne H.,"Valencia, CA",665,447,2370.0,2.0,2013-07-29,"I dined here last Saturday night. Let me start by saying it took me a few days to post this review as when I drafted this, my blood was boiling! I really wanted this review to have a fair rating so waited a few days to cool off.... With that said, I arrived at CPK around 9pm on a Sat night. I was tired and looking forward to unwinding. I almost opted to sit at the bar as there was no wait but decided to wait the 10 mins for a table, whichwas about 10 mins more or less. The hostess showed us to our table, right next to the hostess stand - totally fine. I looked at the table and immediately saw it was dirty: water rings from previous glasses, crumbs and a hair (yuck!) which I mentioned and pointed out. The hostess gave me ""this look"" like I was being prissy and placed her finger on top of the hair and dragged it off the table slow and exaggerated, which was followed by a pointed stare back to me and dead silence. Okay, I don't know what planet she came from but that was definitely NOT COOL. I've dined at plenty of eateries, high end, low budget, hood, to schamncy and never have I experienced that kind of rude, blatant attitude. I was dumbfounded. then REALLY mad! Rather than succumb to a full-blown confrontation, I decided to keep my ladylike composure and sat down. We placed our order and I skipped out on wine because I was silently fuming on the inside and didn't feel like unwinding at all anymore. Anyway, our server Tiffany, was great and very friendly. Polite, attentive, great attitude - she was the silver lining to my dreary experience and compensated for the manners the hostess was lacking.. The venue itself was loud, busy, the usual at any CPK location. Food was up to par with my usual visits to CPK. We finished up our meal and while the BF was waiting for the food to be boxed, I made my way over to the manager station in the back. Mike, the manager on shift, noticed my milling about and promptly came over to inquire if I needed anything. I proceeded to explain the unpleasant event that unfolded earlier and did my best to remain cool, calm and collected. I noticed a lot of the staff around us looked alarmed and were trying to eavesdrop on what was happening, but I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it. I merely wanted to state the facts and inform the manager of the bad attitude of one of his hostesses. I also asked for the contact information to the corporate office, which the manager provided me with. He did try to reassure me that he would address this matter with that employee ASAP and I appreciated his gesture. Anyway, I took the business card, said good night and made my way out. This experience was a total turn off and locked away in the memory bank. Not sure if I feel up for returning to this location in the future. I really could have made my own salad and saved myself some money, but chose to dine out for the experience, which means service is part of that, not just the food.

I ordered the white pizza with bacon, and she ordered the tortilla soup and something else. While I cannot speak to her dish, my white pizza was freakin' awesome. It was delicious. The addition of bacon to the cheeses was amazing, and I'm pretty sure I could've eaten two pizzas if two had been brought out to me. It was that good. Also, I'm fat.  The service was really good. We were greeted quickly and promptly seated outside. We had our drink and food orders taken really quickly, everything came out pretty quickly, and the waitress was really good about making sure we had water in our glasses and a clean table.  The place itself is cool, too. It's very much like every other CPK ever in the world, except I feel that since Burbank is a smaller city, this is one of the cooler spots in the city (that says more about the city than the CPK).

The environment is clean, well-kept, and noise levels are what one expects at a family restaurant. I've noticed recently the CPK's across SoCal have been attempting to 'de-chain' themselves: matching uniforms are no longer required, gone are the cookie-cutter black booths from some restaurants. This gesture I feel is a step in the right direction, which is conducive to a better experience overall.  The food has gotten better over the years quality-wise, and I think CPK's new crust which they introduced this year took their pizzas to the next level. I feel the crust is the most important part of the pizza, and CPK successfully transitioned from the chewy, tasteless dough surrounding the pizza to an airy, crispy complement to the pizza. The appetizers are diverse and taste decent; I usually order the rolls and dumplings. For the entrees, I wolf down either a Margherita or Sicilian pizza, two thin-crust pizzas which I feel are the most refined pizzas on CPK's menu. Regarding pastas, the Kung Pao Spaghetti and Fettucine Alfredo are at the top of my list. The Kung Pao keeps the heat at a tolerable yet invigorating level, and doesn't overload on the saltiness. The peanuts have a slightly roasted flavor and texture, which are welcome as I eat the pasta. The Fettucine Alfredo also earns praise; the sauce is perfectly creamy, and the noodles cooked well.  Overall, a good family restaurant that's reliable to fill you with a decent meal that's well worth the money",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=260,3.8,3.48,3.48,3.568,3.608

The sandwich was quite delicious.  Perfect combination of salty, savory, crispy, and crunchy bread.  The soup was also pretty tasty.   Moroccan salad, half - this was a bit dry (which was actually a blessing; see below).  This was otherwise a refreshing mix of iceberg lettuce, dates, cranberries, nuts, and seasoned chicken.  We couldn't quite tell what the seasoning was, because there was very little dressing.    So you would think, with this sensible spread between the two of us, we would be ahead of the game, right?  NOPE.  According to their own website (  ), this lunch works out to 1500 calories per person.  Out of 2000 calories daily allotment.  WOW.

Bland.  For some reason, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - stands out, flavor-wise, on any of the pizzas I have tried at CPK.  They all sound incredible, though.  It's as if an airline is making - and ruining - these pizzas.   Again, I am sure some wonderful people put their money, hearts and souls into this place but try as I might - and I have- many times, I really can't stand the pizza at California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=140,3.92,3.69,3.69,3.1760000000000006,3.782

I guess I had high expectations eating at a CPK in California. Believe me when I tell you that the service, food, and sanitation was absolutely disappointing. While ordering our lunch, we decided to have some bread to start off with and boy was it a lot! Two small pieces for two people. What a great appetizer if you ask me. Now this part really gets: the service. The girl serving us is actually going to be the reason why I will never come back. She never bothered to come by to refill our drinks. If we needed something, we had to get up out of our seats and approach her. I would understand that if she was busy, it'd be hard to get around to us. I would've pitied her. Does that mean I can't receive some decent service from a waitress who is too busy walking around? Why is it my job to literally get up off my seat to get a new knife because the one that seemed to come so neatly wrapped had some weird leftover lettuce stuck to it? Now here's to the food. My all time favorite Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza will never be the same. All the other CPKs that I've eaten at have done a pretty good job in making the Spicy Chipotle Chicken appetizing; here, it was not the case. The pizza was so dry that I was almost tempted to ask the waitress for some more sauce that came with the pizza...but then again, I would have to get up so what's the point, right? The nicely stacked, pile of corn and veggies that was supposed to be in the center of the pizza was nowhere to be seen. In fact, I don't even remember if there was any corn for that matter. Why serve me a pizza that looks nothing like the one advertised? Overall, the food wasn't bad, but I did have high expectations.  Now, the check. As I've mentioned before, the waitress was either always walking, standing, or doing nothing and yet it was so hard to get her attention in the midst of what seemed like a busy day for her. I ended up getting out of my seat...AGAIN after waiting 15 minutes to ask for a check. The only thing I really liked about this place was that the girl who seated us was really friendly. It made us feel comfortable and happy to eat there...until of course, we started getting the service or lack there of if I should say.

I am average height I am average weight and... I always, up until yesterday fit in their booths. My immediate thought was... if I was pregnant and wanted a comfy cushion, I couldn't sit here. That seems wrong. My second thought was if I was in the 100 - 200 pounds, I might be insulted that a booth isn't an option for me.  No idea what happened or why but the furnishing changed.

One downside that I realized a difference in would be the food. They did take several dishes out and updated the menu. I had the spinach artichoke as an appetizer which was delicious.

Which as a former server I can appreciate. He was very accommodating and really well versed with the menu and adding options to entrées. I ordered a chicken lime fettuccini dish off the menu. When I asked if I could take out the peppers he was very happy to let me know that not only could they do that but they could add something in its place. When the dish came out, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting and I think Thomas could read the disappointment on my face. He was so kind and offered to get me something else, and though I felt embarrassed about my own mistake he was so gracious and helped me figure out exactly what I was looking for in the pasta dish I desired.

I went in sat night opened the door and the first thing I notice was the noise.  Plates clanking, spots TV blasting, wait staff running around and very loud conversation by the overcrowding of guest.  So when I saw this I decided not to over task the staff and get the heck out so I ordered to go.  About 30 minutes later the food order showed up. Now I expected this and was not the least bit perturbed about it.  But the bottom line is this:  most franchise places like CPK; quality of service decrease exponentially with and increase of customers represented by the following formula:  (q2+s)-(Cx*T)= q of S.

I'll just say the Asian girl handling the register was rude, had an attitude, and you could tell she was troubled just because I asked for bread with my take-out. She sliced me two very small pieces of bread and basically threw it in the bag (rather than placing it in there). I should also mention that I asked for the bread and to join the Pizza Dough promotion in advance over the phone. But neither the bread or flyer for the Pizza Dough was in the bag like they said it would be. My point is, why make the offer to do so if you're not going to do what you said?

118,Jennifer S.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,18,,4.0,2015-07-11,"OK, CPK, you and I have been friends for a long time but I've got a bone to pick with you. Remember a long time ago when you discontinued the Tandoori Chicken pizza, and I was really sad? I've grown to accept this loss. Then there was the absence of the garlic shrimp pizza, an indulgence I enjoyed on occasion, but I could live without. But now, OH BOY, now you've gone TOO FAR, CPK. You've discontinued the tiramisu. You are FREAKING KIDDING me, right? This is your SIGNATURE dessert! You had the most unique tiramisu in the world, we ordered it EVERY TIME, no matter who I came with. Dinner, lunch, whatever time of day, our meal ended with the delivery of our favorite treat: rich, Sabayon marscarpone sauce, our delicious, decadent dessert proudly perched within this pool of yummy sweetness. It's in your cookbook for crying out loud, doesn't that mean anything?? How can you discontinue the tiramisu??  Formal protest. I am wounded. We came in tonight and had a very nice meal, David was our server and he was a very good waiter. The remodel is fine, though why you decided to exchange the back booths for the bench/chair hybrid tables is beyond me, makes no sense and is awkward (why would you have one party with their back to the storefront window and the other facing it? Awkward light for one person facing the window wall and bad feng shui for the diner in the chair, bad move, store designer!)  But this I can forgive and it won't stop me from coming in (though it will make me picky about where I sit.) But the menu change is kind of a deal-breaker.  You need to bring that tiramisu back, CPK. There's no other dessert on the menu like it, nor is there one worth replacing it. Very sad. Totally changing the dining experience for a lot of people who have been loyal to you for a lot of years. And even though you added Coke products to your menu (this actually DID make me come in more often) it's not enough to balance the loss. Please don't make me start a petition. Just bring back the tiramisu, and let's all enjoy our dessert once again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=140,3.76,3.88,3.88,3.728,3.832

And while I had called a week ahead to see if they took reservations they told me they did not. But they were very helpful and told me to call 2 hrs prior to the time we wanted to arrive and that they would  do their best to accommodate us. Well, they were right on point. I waited all of 10 minutes max before they had our table ready. We were waited on by Tilley. She was very nice and sweet. She was a real pleasure. Her ""woops"" moment and I'm putting that lightly based on the expression on her face was when she accidentally spilled a Coke on me. Poor thing, she was absolutely mortified with herself about it. It was something out of a movie scene. But it had actually just happened to me!! It was truly an accident and I guess I could have reacted upset or made a scene about it given that I was wearing a white pair of pants and a corral top, but for what!? I didn't want to make her feel worse than she already did. They were very attentive and brought me everything possible to help clean me up and make me feel less sticky. The manager immediately came over and asked that I please bring him the receipt for the dry cleaning and they would take care of it. He also comped our table with spinach dip enough for all my guests, which was delicious, as well as comping my dish. After the whole spilling incident Tilley continued to take care of my guests and I amazingly. She had no trouble what so ever tending to all 16 of us all on her own and with no other wait staff's assistance. I could go on and on about our entire experience but in a nutshell, great service!!

I shared a pizza and pasta dish with a friend and we both could not get over how good the food and the service were. The whole vibe was really cool starting with our server Victor who took the time to just talk with us and connect. Really cool dude...it made for a nice experience at CPK. Another server also chatted with us about the red wine flight we ordered and that was really cool too. One thing that really stood out was the pizza was somehow different than before--it was better and we later found out that they changed the dough recipe. I've always been a CPK fan so I didn't really notice the subtle deviation in the pizza dough but my friend, a pizza aficionado, tasted the difference and was more than pleased.

I called a couple weeks beforehand to reserve/'call ahead' since we had a party of 18 and it was no problem.  I ordered a couple appetizers, two each of two different salads, and eight pizzas altogether for the whole party as to alleviate some of the stress of 18 people ordering 18 different things and to help expedite the kitchen. Everything was brought out timely and hot and we all left with full tummies and lots of to-go boxes. Our server, Go, was totally charming and on top of things the entire evening.  The star of the dinner (besides the birthday celebrant himself, of course) was the red velvet cake! Ohmygoodness. We opted to just have the restaurant provide the birthday cake, instead of worrying about picking one up somewhere else or bringing one from home. Such a good idea, cuz damn, I am never baking a red velvet cake ever again!!! The frosting was super light and creamy and the cake was fluffy and moist and... my mouth is watering, lol.  Docking a star because while sitting on the patio, we were treated to the dumpster getting emptied and a lady selling plastic roses. Get a gate to block the sidewalks, please! That street corner is so busy, too! We had a couple little kids toddling around and were alarmed to realize there was no gate separating the restaurant patio from the sidewalk.

Going to Cheesecake Factory next time for this go-to app. Entree 1- Bbq chopped salad. Always a must for me.  Entree 2- Hawaiian pizza. Shockingly lacked in flavor. Disappointing. Dessert- red velvet cake. For sure refrigerated. Meh. The vanilla bean cream on the side was better than the meh cake.  Service was meh- host was great. Promote that blonde girl!

She told me we don't have here and just proceeded doing what she was doing! No biggie right? I used my knife to stir my coffee, then finished my dinner and chill a little bit..

So this evening being like many others I wanted CPK for dinner and decided to save myself the drive and have it delivered. After searching the various delivery apps turns out Door Dash was the one working with CPK. I placed my order for two salads and used the special request section to request bread butter and olive oil for each, then I called the restaurant to confirm the order had been received as entered which it had. The delivery arrived about 15 minutes soon than estimated which of course was great. However the young man who came to the door and immediately apologized that the restaurant does not bag the food in a restaurant take out bag which is simply not acceptable ad this creates a sanitary issue as the door dashers bag is used numerous times a day and food items should not be placed directly into the drivers bag. Not to mention that because and initial packing of the order is not done the food shift quite a bit and the presentation upon delivery is NOT appealing and of course the bread and butter were not included.

9,Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,461.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"Updating my review since I have dined here many times since then. I also need to complain about my last visit here. Came here for dinner, and our server was no where to be found. We sat for 15 minutes just waiting and no one acknowledged us. Finally a lady came over and asked if we'd been helped yet. After we said no, she said she was going to find our server. After some more time, the same lady came out and she ended up being our server for the night. There was a table behind us that got seated as well and they couldn't find our server either who turns out is a really short blond girl. The table behind us waited so long for their food that the father even got up to flag someone down at the bar. What's with this server?? The girl that DID in fact tend to us was good. So, first of all let me say that yes, it was my mistake for ordering something off the menu that isn't pizza. Why go to a place that specializes in pizza and has pizza in the name and NOT order pizza? I don't know. I was craving pasta. So I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta. I asked if I was able to swap out the zucchini with real pasta like fettuccine but the server assured me that there was already fettuccine in the dish. I was pleased. But then my dish came. I assumed that the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta had zucchini spirals that mimic pasta - a healthier option. NOPE. Just fat chunks of zucchini and maybe only 8 strands of fettuccine. The shrimp was so obviously frozen and looked so unappetizing. Not only that, but the shrimp was WAY overcooked. Didn't eat them. The ""sauce"" to the pasta was so incredibly watery it was gross. I took about 2 bites of my dish and was done - inedible.  So in my experience, not only was our original server MIA, my sad sad excuse for a shrimp scampi pasta dish was pathetic. CPK should be ashamed to have this item on their menu. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING OTHER THAN PIZZA HERE or you'll get a sad dish. I know to ONLY get pizza here from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank,3.52,3.98,3.828,2.9160000000000004,3.7960000000000003

The place was clean, not too busy, and it was pretty quiet. My friend liked the Free Wi-Fi. I loved the great service.  As I entered I signed up to be seated and only have to wait for 5 minutes. After, I was asked to be seated. My waiter was Jen, she was pretty nice and very informative. We asked questions and she gave us straight answers, and explained the menu. She also gave us time to look at the menu, and didn't completely abandoned us, she checks up on us from time to time.  We order our drinks and appetizers, and she gave us our time again to enjoy the food. The waiting time wasn't bad, I chatted with my friend and only just a few minutes our main food was served. The food was hot, and nicely presented, I enjoyed eating it and chatting with my friend at a heated temperature, and quiet restaurant.  I like the fact that I didn't have to request for refills or our empty plates needed to be taken off the table. Each time I finished my drink, a new one comes up! And each time we clear a plate, it was immediately taken off. I couldn't finished my meal, so I asked for a take out. The food could have been  combined with my pasta and that small piece of pizza, but I was impressed that Jen consider the two foods to be separated despite its small amount.  Alas, I enjoyed the food, the service, and the atmosphere of the restaurant. The restroom was also cleaned and nicely scented.

The taste was still good but the crust was just ok. I really liked the honey wheat crust. The bbq sauce and the chicken witht he smoked gouda is classic California style pizza. Could have used a little more chicken pieces but still enjoyed it. Also ordered was the waldorf chicken salad that comes with grapes, green apple slices, candied walnuts, celery and gorgonzola. It was a hit. And another bbq chicken pizza with cilantro.  Good meal, decent prices. Service was fine. Nothing special. Just your typical CPK dinner. Plenty of parking now that Ikea has moved.

The hostess was friendlier and smiled and asked, 'how was your day?'.  Our server was pleasant and even though the restaurant was full, made it seem that he wasn't rushed for us. I tried the cucumber cooler which was delicious.  There's no free refills on that one, though. I asked. It's loud in there. We had two small mistakes in our order. I ordered the arugula/asparagus salad, and they served me the wedge. And my mom shouldn't eat meat--for health reasons--and I heard her ask for no chicken on her pizza, but I think I saw some on it. I could be wrong. We were given three dishes of bread--warm bread--and dipping sauce. (My mother is a diabetic, she was on a roll and couldn't stop with the bread. Since it was mother's day celebration for us, I didn't say anything. She was rude to the server, and I was embarrassed). My son had mac n cheese, which he enjoyed. And both my salad and my Hawaiian pizza were fresh.  I asked for chili pepper flakes, which came in a small bowl with a spoon. Compared to Orange County CPK, this was a more pleasant dining experience, the food was better than both Orange County and Long Beach CPK's we go to.

From hosting, bussing, running, expediting, serving and managing.  We walked in and there was no wait. They didn't seem busy. Most people like to say ""why is there a wait when there are open tables?"" Or ""why is our service so slow when there are a lot of open tables?""  But it's not by how many open tables there are it's how many servers are on the floor and how big their section is and how many times they were sat. I was looking around and there were about 5/6 servers plus the managers and the hostesses and the bussers.  I felt like every server had about 5 or 6 tables which is pretty normal for most restaurants. But I don't think these servers can handle 5/6 tables. I heard a few of them complaining about how ""slammed"" they were. And servers asking other servers if they wanted to take tables from other sections. We waited some time and wasn't greeted. Our server could have passed us and said ""I'll be right with you"" but she said nothing. She kind of disappeared after serving our drinks. She only checked on us because she caught me staring at her.  Anyway, there was a server named JENN. And this girl was horrible.... SHE WAS EATING AND CHEWING FOOD while serving her tables. Like girl, you could have at least stopped chewing in front of your table! Get it together.  The hostess was really sweet and pleasant though! One star is for her!

2,Tarablake P.,"Los Angeles, CA",297,10,1.0,1.0,2017-11-26,"Today was my Dad's 60th birthday. My family (5) decided to come here for lunch.  Service: The hostess was nice and seated us right away. She sat us behind the patrician that separates the computers and booth tables toward the back. They put together 3 tables, in which all 3 were wobbling. When we mentioned this to our server, she came back with paper coasters informing us that is all they have. She did not offer to help after that. The runners did not offer any help, either. One of my family members ended up having to adjust the tables. This caught me off guard because we have come to this location on several occasions and the service is always great! Unfortunately, not this time.  Food: We ordered the 5 cheese pizza, the quinoa and arugula salad with salmon, the chicken piccata, and the  bolognese spaghetti. The salad was great, with the salmon (server suggestion). The spaghetti was dry. Although, we asked for extra meat sauce, it did not change the dryness. It tasted as though the dish was sitting out for some time before it was served to us. Mostly, everything came out around the same time except for the pizza. When we reminded the server about it, she said it was not in her notes. As a customers point of view, she forgot about it. She put in the order and informed us that she put a rush on it. When it came out I pulled one slice off the plate and the pizza was extremely floppy and soggy. The cheese fell right off and the center of the pizza was so thinned out. We had to cancel the order. We did not receive any apologies on this matter, not even from the manager on duty! For dessert, I asked for a butter cake as a surprise for my Dad's birthday. I did not ask for it to be complimentary. I specifically told the hostess to please have the server bring out the butter cake at the end. I don't remember if the one scoop of ice cream is an extra cost but when the the butter cake came out, it was served with no ice cream. It just so happened the the family next to me had a birthday, as well. It looked as though they requested a brownie and it came out the same time our butter cake did. They definitely had a scoop of ice cream on their brownie dessert.  The only thing that gave this place 1 star was the salad and a polite hostess. Overall, the customer service, food, as well as management during today's lunch shift was a disappointment. I am hoping it was just a bad day. I know this may not a big deal to some but it's the little things that matter the most. We had a horrible birthday lunch for my Dad. I don't suggest coming here for big parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank,2.96,3.5,3.768,,3.2840000000000003

They definitely had a rebranding effort and meh idk if it makes that much of a difference but it is more welcoming to everyone now I guess.. The food. hmm. In my opinion, the flavor was better in the past. I loved their Kung Pao Spaghetti, Jambalaya, Chipotle Chicken Pizza, and Thai Chicken Pizza. They are all still good but the portions are definitely smaller than before. I always go to Costco to get their gift card to this place. $79.99 for $100 worth! So that is already 20% off. Also, they have an app that you can download to accumulate points for rewards! Service is bleh. The current manager is a lady in her 30's and she seems unhappy.... no smiling whatsoever. Maybe overwhelmed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank,2.96,3.52,3.764,,3.2960000000000003

12,Dennisse M.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,,5.0,2017-12-16,"I've been here several times throughout the years and though I have always enjoyed the food I've never felt compelled to write a review until today.   We came for lunch because we were craving a bbq chicken salad. To our surprise they had a shrimp scampi pizza. It was delicious and I was happy because they used to have a shrimp pizza and they took it off the menu. I highly suggest trying it.  But the whole reason for this review was our server Frank. From the moment he came to the table he was a delight. Full of great energy, witty humor, and excellent service. He joked around with our 11 year old and us equally. And every time he walked away we all remarked how much we love him. We came for lunch but left with an experience. From now on we will always ask for Frank. He's definitely the best part of our lunch today. Five stars for Frank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank,3.04,3.52,3.772,,3.3280000000000007

3,Catarino C.,"Sylmar, CA",29,63,234.0,4.0,2018-01-04,We placed our order over the phone and the person taking order was very courteous and helpful. We were told our order would be ready in 40 minutes so we showed up 40 minutes later and our order was ready to go. Cashier promptly brought our order to us and we were out of there. Restaurant was clean and staff was helpful. Food is good and noticed they have a bar section inside with sports games playing on television screens. Plenty of free parking in garage adjacent to restaurant. Will probably come back for dinner and a drink with the wife.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank,3.04,3.51,3.76,,3.322
