And here are the reasons why: #1.  Outdoor seating. #2.  Great tasting pizza. #3.  Value.  Reasonable prices & generous portions. #4.  (and most important) EXCELLENT service. I can't stress how great the service has been on all four of my visits.  The servers are friendly, professional, attentive, etc etc etc. My only suggestion for this place would be to extend the beer menu.

57,Beatrice B.,"Cambridge, MA",0,15,,3.0,2013-05-17,Honestly it was just okay. I went here with my boyfriend and his mother yesterday for a fundraiser for the Cambridge After School Program. In all honesty I didn't choose to come here they did. It never seemed appealing to me so I had never walked in until yesterday. We walked in and were seated instantly by a very nice waitress. I ended up ordering a Garlic Parmesan fettuccine. It only took 15 minutes to get our food. Once our food had arrived the waitress informed me that I got the wrong order and that my order would be coming out shortly. Honestly what I almost got looked more appealing than what I actually got. It was very bland and I had to force myself to finish the rest. The portions were reasonable and I didn't need to carry out. But over all not to special. Won't go out of my way to go here and would much prefer Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

35,Melissa M.,"Medford, MA",834,1030,8.0,4.0,2013-06-20,"I am not a big fan of shopping malls but I am a fan of eating and I ended up at this CPK on a Sunday afternoon. The mall was packed but the restaurant was quiet.  We got the spinach and artichoke dip and while it was good I remember it being better years ago.  Also, some of the chips seemed stale and I always feel like they give you way too many chips since you finish the dip and still have 1/2 the chips left on the plate. Anyway, I got a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and was asked if I wanted 6 or 9 ounces.  I only got 6 ounces because 9 ounces sounded like a lot.  And it was the afternoon and I knew I'd be drinking later in the day with dinner. I ended up getting the field green salad with candied walnuts, pears and a dijon vinaigrette.  The salad was good and big and I only got a 1/2 salad.  The full salad I was told was huge and I really don't feel like a Big Salad of Epic Proportions like the kind you get across the way at Cheesecake Factory. Our server was very nice and friendly and fast, her name was Anna. I always appreciate good service and we will be back very soon. The old ball and chain got the kung pao pasta and enjoyed it.  I thought it looked good but was trying to be healthy and that's why I got a salad. The price was forty something bucks and I think that's a good deal. We will definitely be back soon when the craving for CPK comes upon us! *Note, they validate for parking and it was only $1.99 to park in the garage in the mall.  Another great deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
43,Eunice E.,"Baltimore, MD",321,503,69.0,2.0,2013-07-02,"So, the food is always tasty... I'm a sucker for the Chinese chicken salad (half portion will feed two comfortably), and the carnitas pizza with that habanero salsa (caution: uber tasty and SPICY!)... that's not my gripe with this place. In fact, I was all set to give it a more favorable rating, but the last time I came here, I was lied to. And I didn't need to be.  I had ordered the pizza with whole wheat crust, and after taking my first few bites, I knew without a doubt that it was on white crust. My dinner partner had already scarfed down a few slices while I was still on my first few bites, and I just casually said, ""This isn't whole wheat."" A few chews later, said partner agreed, so I flagged down our waitress and just asked her, ""Is this whole wheat?"" To which she replied, ""Yes -- we've switched to a new wheat crust which is fluffier.""  ... Did you switch to a wheat crust that's also white? Girl, you could've just said, oh, my bad, my mistake, and that would've been fine. I mean, the pizza was already almost all gone, so it's not like I would've sent it back, but I just wanted to confirm what I already knew. Out of principle. Because I knew I had ordered it specifically on wheat. Sigh. Just left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. Oh, well.

The waiter started to clear the table, brought the check over and put my friends take home on the table.

Not only that but my husband began to feel nauseas and we had to go to the hospital after that.

She came back with our drinks and asked if we wanted any appetizers which we did. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip as well as the White Corn Guacamole. I thought the Spinach and Artichoke dip was too garlicky and a little bitter. The guacamole was tasty but was too small given the large amount of chips they gave us. No big deal.  The entrees were also just ok. One friend got the pulled pork pizza and the other got the margarita pizza. Both were fine, could have been crispier. I got the shrimp scampi which lacked flavor.

40,Maria D.,"Cambridge, MA",82,137,11.0,2.0,2014-11-30,"Pro: Gluten free options Con: They serve cheese on your cheese pizzas sparingly CPK is not too far, and it's a good place for me to get a quick lunch on a weekend. However, I've run into several problems: (1) The portion options for the GF contingent (me) are just not fair. Why do I have to consume so much of a pizza when my non-Celiac friends can eat less and pay less? I don't know how other people do it, but pizza leftovers are just gross...especially when they're gluten free. Remember, people, this is not NYC, the pizza is pretty bad.  If you absolutely have to, get the Untraditional cheese. It's still pretty bad, but you will at least not have to deal with the incredibly stale 35-day old crust that they try to serve you as if it's fresh. Be not fooled, my GF buddies, this grossness can not be fresh at all.  Online ordering is easy. Pickup is easy.  But..the guacamole is also gross. Am I being very judgmental today? I think so, but I wouldn't be this way if I didn't have a reason. I've been here about 4 times, total, and I haven't had any experience that deserves more than 2 stars (and I've had some that deserve less...I think you would agree if you ended up with ingredients on your pizza that you never asked for)!  Want gluten free pizza? I'm going to keep looking.

Don't get me wrong, she did her job and in a timely manner but she wasn't as friendly and welcoming as waitresses often are and things felt rushed. I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with chicken added. It looked creamy when it first arrived but soon became very dry, almost glue-like as it cooled down. The flavor also wasn't all the way there; kind of bland. The chicken was cooked fine, not too dry or anything. I will say, their desserts are great. The Tiramisu was excellent.

We sat down, asked for water, but the water came out in about 30minutes. No one came to our table and we had to ask two other waiter/waitress until we got our waiter.  We ordered three entrees. First one (Jambalaya fettuccine) had a piece of plastic in it. Again, it took forever to get our waiter and then to get the manager. The manager said he'll take it off our bill and said he doesn't know why it's in there. He asked us if we wanted another one or what we wanted him to do. He wasn't very apologetic. If anything he came off as rude making us feel like we were the ones overreacting.  Then  came my salad. I ate 1/3 way through the salad, when I found a receipt. It was a whole receipt at the bottom of my salad. I was so shocked that I was having palpitation and my hand started shaking. What was even more disgusting was the fact that the receipt wasnt even for our order. We had to call the manager again. He was more apologetic than the first time and again took it off our bill.  What was even more ridiculous was the fact that the manager had brought back the salad with the receipt in it and left it on our table. Like why would you even give it back to us. Did they actually expect us to eat?? When our third entree came we just didn't have any appetite and just asked them to take it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I particularly appreciated the open kitchen, but found the dining room itself to feel a little ""sticky"" as in the tables are not well wiped and there is little attention to detail.  But, with a staff that seems to just be learning the restaurant industry, it is probably something to be expected.  The manager was very nice and friendly, and he seemed to really set the tone for the staff because they are all very nice as well.
