I had not eaten at a CPK in years and was very surprised at the decor and the menu of this very pretty pizza kitchen! We sat on the indoor patio and started out with some cold Chardonnay on this stifling hot night in Canoga Park. We shared delicious spinach artichoke dip which was enough for four and served with tortilla chips. I had the lettuce wraps with chicken and shrimp. Fresh shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, and scallions were tossed in a spicy ginger soy sauce served with peanut dipping sauce on the side! Yum! We also had the grilled chicken Caesar sandwich with shaved Parmesan, lettuce, and tomatoes. We ordered off the ""secret"" menu too since we were with old pros who knew this trick. The tricolore pizza is a holdover from early CPK days and had field greens, chicken, shaved Parmesan and crispy crust. For dessert try the butter cake with Haagen -Dazs vanilla ice cream!

537,Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, United States",2,164,121.0,3.0,2013-02-11,This is a hard review for me to write. I am not a fan of CPK. I only eat there because its my sisters favorite place to eat and she does not get out much. I would never go of my own volition. I have to say yesterday was very hard going to CPK when I had to walk right by my all time favorite place that has now moved into the Westfield Mall- The Cheesecake Factory............. I have been going to CPK for at least 13 years now.  I find their menu selection pretty limited.  (Yes the word Pizza is in their name so it should come as no surprise). As usual this location is several STEPS UP from the Tarzana Location (inadvertently listed on Yelp as Encino).  The employees here are almost always really friendly and nice. The managers always come by at some point to check.  They do always want to make things right and I appreciate their customer service. I was very pleased when ordering my meal that at this location they are able to accommodate- whereas the Tarzana location they tell me to go pound sand.  We were forced to go to the Tarzana location while this CPK moved into their new place in Westfield.  I had in fact not ordered any food my last several visits. It was with great trepidation that I ordered and I was so pleased that they did not even blink an eye with my request for my crust to be done lightly.  I find if it gets browned it has the texture of a stale dog biscuit and even with my good teeth I find I would rather eat my dogs milk bones then their crust. I have not been able to say this for a long time about CPK but yesterday my food was perfect.  YAY Again I have never had an issue with their employees- they are great- and yesterday was no different. My only complaint is this.  In this location they have changed how their bathrooms were set up.  There is a door that leads to the toilets.  Ok no problem.  You finish in the bathroom and SURPRISE THERE IS NO SINK IN THE TOILET AREA. WHAT?   There are also no paper towels.  That means that you have to TOUCH A DOOR HANDLE TO GET OUT TO THE SINK AREA.  I can not even begin to conceive the amount of E-Coli and who knows what else that is on that door handle.  I presume to save money and space they thought it was a good idea to have one sink area to service the mens and ladies rooms and the employees.  I am honestly shocked that the Health Department was ok with this set up. My gross out factor was HIGH.  I did not feel like I could get my hands clean enough after touching that door.  I will definitely take Clorox Wipes in with me the next time.  Cheesecake Factory will still tug at my heart and stomach as I go by there in a few months but at least I will not be dreading my visit to CPK as I had for the last several months while they renovated and we were stuck going to the Tarzana store.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=200,3.0,3.11,3.11,2.9880000000000004,3.066

I like the new decor, which is more rustic yet clean & modern and the restaurant is very open structurally to the mall.  They have a dispenser of lemonade or some drink out front which is nice to have available while you're waiting.  They have a lot of hostesses working at the front with iPads and they seemed fairly organized.  We were seated within 5 minutes. Menu seems to be pretty much the same standard Cpk.  I did notice a chalkboard sign promoting a secret menu (not very secretive though) so I tried the garlic chicken pizza.  It was really good.  The waitress said I was the 2nd person to order it...

After being sufficiently ripped off, I felt as if I was in the way as there really is no place to stand to wait for takeout. I exited and waited for a few minutes and walked back in only narrowly missing being crashed into by a server who was absolutely not looking where he was going  and didn't even apologize for almost running me down. A different girl behind takeout asked what I needed to which I replied I was picking up an order and she asked ""Did you already pay for it?""  I was astonished, don't they put a receipt that says paid or something next to the order? I could have said yes and walked out without getting ripped off for a mediocre salad.  Mind you, this is the large portion and the takeout ramekin of dressing was not even half full. Most of my salad went undressed and as I had already left I was unable to get more dressing and ended up throwing half of my salad away.

84,Ej F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",427,498,1568.0,4.0,2013-08-03,"This is a review of the new location in the Westfield Topanga.  The old place is turning into a Cheesecake Factory (even though there's one nearby on Canoga Ave).  The open seating bar/lounge area in the center of the mall is pretty cool. Full menu is available out there. I like the new decor, which is more rustic yet clean & modern and the restaurant is very open structurally to the mall.  They have a dispenser of lemonade or some drink out front which is nice to have available while you're waiting.  They have a lot of hostesses working at the front with iPads and they seemed fairly organized.  We were seated within 5 minutes. Menu seems to be pretty much the same standard Cpk.  I did notice a chalkboard sign promoting a secret menu (not very secretive though) so I tried the garlic chicken pizza.  It was really good.  The waitress said I was the 2nd person to order it... I wish I was the first!  Also were happy that they really improved the quality of their free bread.

I had not eaten at a CPK in years and was very surprised at the decor and the menu of this very pretty pizza kitchen! We sat on the indoor patio and started out with some cold Chardonnay on this stifling hot night in Canoga Park. We shared delicious spinach artichoke dip which was enough for four and served with tortilla chips. I had the lettuce wraps with chicken and shrimp. Fresh shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, and scallions were tossed in a spicy ginger soy sauce served with peanut dipping sauce on the side! Yum! We also had the grilled chicken Caesar sandwich with shaved Parmesan, lettuce, and tomatoes. We ordered off the ""secret"" menu too since we were with old pros who knew this trick. The tricolore pizza is a holdover from early CPK days and had field greens, chicken, shaved Parmesan and crispy crust. For dessert try the butter cake with Haagen -Dazs vanilla ice cream!

222,Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121.0,3.0,2013-11-02,This is a hard review for me to write. I am not a fan of CPK. I only eat there because its my sisters favorite place to eat and she does not get out much. I would never go of my own volition. I have to say yesterday was very hard going to CPK when I had to walk right by my all time favorite place that has now moved into the Westfield Mall- The Cheesecake Factory............. I have been going to CPK for at least 13 years now.  I find their menu selection pretty limited.  (Yes the word Pizza is in their name so it should come as no surprise). As usual this location is several STEPS UP from the Tarzana Location (inadvertently listed on Yelp as Encino).  The employees here are almost always really friendly and nice. The managers always come by at some point to check.  They do always want to make things right and I appreciate their customer service. I was very pleased when ordering my meal that at this location they are able to accommodate- whereas the Tarzana location they tell me to go pound sand.  We were forced to go to the Tarzana location while this CPK moved into their new place in Westfield.  I had in fact not ordered any food my last several visits. It was with great trepidation that I ordered and I was so pleased that they did not even blink an eye with my request for my crust to be done lightly.  I find if it gets browned it has the texture of a stale dog biscuit and even with my good teeth I find I would rather eat my dogs milk bones then their crust. I have not been able to say this for a long time about CPK but yesterday my food was perfect.  YAY Again I have never had an issue with their employees- they are great- and yesterday was no different. My only complaint is this.  In this location they have changed how their bathrooms were set up.  There is a door that leads to the toilets.  Ok no problem.  You finish in the bathroom and SURPRISE THERE IS NO SINK IN THE TOILET AREA. WHAT?   There are also no paper towels.  That means that you have to TOUCH A DOOR HANDLE TO GET OUT TO THE SINK AREA.  I can not even begin to conceive the amount of E-Coli and who knows what else that is on that door handle.  I presume to save money and space they thought it was a good idea to have one sink area to service the mens and ladies rooms and the employees.  I am honestly shocked that the Health Department was ok with this set up.

485,Ida A.,"WOODLAND HLS, United States",116,75,123.0,3.0,2014-02-06,"I have been going to CPK for over 10 years now. Ever since I was in middle school. This has always been one of my favorite places to eat of all time. I've been going to this particular one for as long as I can remember but it used to be located where the new Cheesecake Factory now is. I liked that location better because it was on the outside of the mall so you didnt have to walk thru the entire mall if you wanted to just eat at CPK.  The new one is completely different than the old. New style more up to date. The last few times I have been to CPK they really havent been the same.  If I had to guess I would think that they changed their recipes. I asked them and they said no but maybe the cooks were just having off days.  My absolute favorites from CPK are the spinach and artichoke dip, BBQ pizza and the chicken Caesar sandwich. My mom loves this place so we decided to give it another shot. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and she ordered the garlic fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms.  We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip was good. Not AMAZING like it used to be. I used to think it was the best on earth. I still do but it isnt like how it used to be at all. The BBQ chicken pizza was better this time than I ordered it last. I can't complain.  My mom's pasta was good also. Not as garlicky as you would think since it has garlic in the name. Not very heavy and creamy like a standard fettuccine. We ordered a chicken caesar sandwich to go also. They got rid of the foccacia bread which is really disappointing. The new bread isnt bad but the old was much better.  The service was good. We sat in the part where the bar is in the middle of the mall.  They have an inside dining and an outside part that is situated directly in the middle of the mall in between the stores. I don't really care that they have that there but they do have a full bar and tvs so if you're in the mall and just want to grab a drink and watch a game its good for the fellas.  Overall its alright.  Im loosing my CPK cravings as time goes by. This place isnt fine dining but used to be really tasty for what it is.

Food: my mom and I both ordered the Italian chopped salad. Hers came with tomatoes and basil and mine didn't, which I kind of don't get since these identical salads could've been mixed in the same bowl. We both also asked for extra garbanzo beans, but there were very few in either salad. I know these ""problems"" could've easily been rectified, but we were in sort of a rush and (without telling our waitress that fact) our food had come quickly (which we very much appreciated). My salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't correct.  I used to LOVE CPK. I used to come a few times a month with my friends and I always ordered the spicy Thai chicken pasta.

Ambience: this CPK has recently been moved to a new location inside the mall and is completely re-styled from how it was before. It was a little more modern, a little less ""screaming kids running around"". Which would've been great if there hadn't been a screaming child next to us. Le sigh... Food: my mom and I both ordered the Italian chopped salad. Hers came with tomatoes and basil and mine didn't, which I kind of don't get since these identical salads could've been mixed in the same bowl. We both also asked for extra garbanzo beans, but there were very few in either salad. I know these ""problems"" could've easily been rectified, but we were in sort of a rush and (without telling our waitress that fact) our food had come quickly (which we very much appreciated). My salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't correct.  I used to LOVE CPK. I used to come a few times a month with my friends and I always ordered the spicy Thai chicken pasta.

New style more up to date. The last few times I have been to CPK they really havent been the same.  If I had to guess I would think that they changed their recipes. I asked them and they said no but maybe the cooks were just having off days.  My absolute favorites from CPK are the spinach and artichoke dip, BBQ pizza and the chicken Caesar sandwich. My mom loves this place so we decided to give it another shot. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and she ordered the garlic fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms.  We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip was good. Not AMAZING like it used to be. I used to think it was the best on earth. I still do but it isnt like how it used to be at all. The BBQ chicken pizza was better this time than I ordered it last. I can't complain.  My mom's pasta was good also. Not as garlicky as you would think since it has garlic in the name. Not very heavy and creamy like a standard fettuccine. We ordered a chicken caesar sandwich to go also. They got rid of the foccacia bread which is really disappointing. The new bread isnt bad but the old was much better.  The service was good. We sat in the part where the bar is in the middle of the mall.  They have an inside dining and an outside part that is situated directly in the middle of the mall in between the stores. I don't really care that they have that there but they do have a full bar and tvs so if you're in the mall and just want to grab a drink and watch a game its good for the fellas.  Overall its alright.  Im loosing my CPK cravings as time goes by. This place isnt fine dining but used to be really tasty for what it is. I will be going back but not on my top 5 to recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=160,3.08,3.11,3.11,2.316,3.098

He took FOREVER TO GET OUR DRINKS TO US!  Then when we were ready to order our food out waiter then never came back around to our table, we had someone else take our food order, and we NEVER had been asked how we where doing, if we needed anything else.  My friend asked for a refill on  her drink she never received it.

266,Esté K.,"Westlake Village, CA",31,26,1.0,4.0,2014-06-09,"So I came here with my mom and sister who had her 3 month old baby and 3.5 year old son.  Things didnt go so well so far as the staff went but I'm actually not even gonna talk about that because I think everyone can have an off day.  What I am gonna say is that the new location in the mall is fantastic.  It's nice and open and even has outdoor seating in the middle of the mall.  The food is always good, that's a given.  Because things were really not going so well I had to ask for the manager.  We were greeted by the general manager, Joseph Polimeni.  He listened to everything I had to say, he never interrupted, he never tried to make an excuse, he asked all the proper questions so that he would be able to speak with his staff and establish exactly where things went wrong and how to correct them. He apologized.  He picked up the tab and was adamant that my mom, who never received her salad had one made to go.  When she said it was OK because she she would be walking through the mall, Joseph made it a point to tell her to just come by and pick it up when she was done shopping so she could bring it home with her.  We've all been to restaurants and had poor service or just had everything go wrong.  We've all had the manager come over and try to sweep it under the rug or offer a token dessert.  I could not have been more impressed by how Mr. Polimeni handled this.  If you read my reviews I tend to focus on the exceptional service and places I've been rather than slamming places for where they fail.  The reason for that is that I believe one bad experience doesn't represent a place that is clearly not a 1 star restaurant.  CPK is a mainstay in Southern California; we'll be back and back again and I just wanted to point out what good will and customer service is all about.  If only more managers learned the proper way to handle things when they go south.  Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=260,3.16,3.1,3.156,2.384,3.1240000000000006

Earlier this week, on a visit, we came here and the it took forever to get appetizers, and even longer to get the plates for the appetizers. It took forever to get drinks. And when the drinks came the root beer was too watery. It took a while to get the waitresses attention, and when we complained about this, the waitress said that she noticed that the root beer looked light. But she had never bothered to ask us about it.  The week before we got a take-out order from this location, and when we got home we realized that they had forgotten to put in the sauces for the lettuce wrap. Today we were shopping in the mall and placed a take out order. According to our receipt, we paid for the to go order at 4:32, and we were told the order would be ready in 20 minutes. The meal did not become available until 5:23. More than 50 minutes later. As I say, I'm a regular customer at CPK.

He apologized.  He picked up the tab and was adamant that my mom, who never received her salad had one made to go.  When she said it was OK because she she would be walking through the mall, Joseph made it a point to tell her to just come by and pick it up when she was done shopping so she could bring it home with her.  We've all been to restaurants and had poor service or just had everything go wrong.  We've all had the manager come over and try to sweep it under the rug or offer a token dessert.  I could not have been more impressed by how Mr. Polimeni handled this.  If you read my reviews I tend to focus on the exceptional service and places I've been rather than slamming places for where they fail.  The reason for that is that I believe one bad experience doesn't represent a place that is clearly not a 1 star restaurant.  CPK is a mainstay in Southern California; we'll be back and back again and I just wanted to point out what good will and customer service is all about.  If only more managers learned the proper way to handle things when they go south.  Thank you!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=260,3.0,3.01,3.088,2.9280000000000004,3.006

I mean why get rid of the delicious focaccia bread for the sandwiches?! Don't fix something that's not broken!! So...not only did they change that, they upped the prices of the sandwiches by $2!! Oh and the bread they now give you at the table is laughable!!! What is this tiny baguette sliced up into 4 pieces (we had a table of 4)?! I'm not exaggerating! The slice is not much bigger than a half dollar coin!!  Now our waitress was very nice and she knew her stuff so this review is based only on the new concept of CPK!  A little change or upgrade isn't bad, but to rid of or change the favorites isn't cool. Oh and I noticed that It's almost not a place to take little kids because it's more trendy and bar like.

I did not deserve this...no one does.  What if my little sick & weak nephew ate this? This is how disease is spread. How allergic reactions can happen, etc.. I just  walked out and never paid. Ill never go back. I tried to order my fave thing from another location but just couldn't do it. Ill never eat there again. This is just one fluke I caught, I wonder what else they do? THINK for a change, restaurant people. Sometimes people have days that are so bad they can't smile or be ultra perky. Its not about you! Next time someone is stressed to the max remember they feel really bad already and give them a break. Stop and think before you act like a scumbag.

Also, two times i have ordered a cup of soup to start and they either didn't bring it out at all or brought it out with the entree. I asked for it to START and then my waitress Annabelle (i think that was her name, she never introduced herself) was totally rude to me the rest of the meal because i asked her not to bring it out after i received my entree.

The table cleaner spilled 3 glasses from the table beside me on my pants and shoes. It took 3 people to clean the spill (it was a big spill) and I got a very rushed sorry from 1 of them. My waitress didn't bother to address the event even though I could see her watching.  I ordered the Guacamole appetizer, the Pear Gorgonzola pizza, Pound cake ice cream dessert, and a Sangria. Keep in mind that this is my usual order at the Northridge or Burbank CPK. The Sangria and Guacamole were the only 2 things that tasted right. The pears in the pizza were not caramelized enough and the amount of Gorgonzola was excessive and overpowering. The pound cake was not baked properly. One slice into the cake and I could see the texture wasn't uniform. The bottom portion still tasted grainy and undercooked. The food was horrible and the service was just as underwhelming.

However, the staff is god awful. The managers join in with wait staff and talk about customers (i heard!) and no one is ever smiling! I work in a restaurant and it upsets me when my waitress comes up to my table and asks what i want to drink without smiling and greeting me.  Also, two times i have ordered a cup of soup to start and they either didn't bring it out at all or brought it out with the entree. I asked for it to START and then my waitress Annabelle (i think that was her name, she never introduced herself) was totally rude to me the rest of the meal because i asked her not to bring it out after i received my entree.  While the food is usually pretty good, today the mac and cheese i ordered was clumpy and not a thin cheese sauce as usual. It came out cold and i was very unhappy with it. Obviously the staff that brought out my food should have seen that the mac didn't look as it does normally. Just sooooo subpar today.

I took my family to the the Westfield Mall to pick up a few items it was my daughters 8th Birthday. While in the mall my family decided to grab dinner since we were approaching bedtime hours. We settled on California Pizza Kitchen because my daughter loves Mac n Cheese and this was the only restaurant in the mall that served that dish. Her birthday, her call, I usually don't frequent here but whatever. The service was sub par seeing as my wife ordered an appetizer Chicken Caesar  Salad but it didn't arrive until the main dish got to our table. Also, my children were not ask if they wanted refills on there little 6 oz lemonades they received when we first got there. This is an 11 and a 8 year old we are talking about here. We were not given water and forgot about the majority of the time we were there. To wrap it all up at the end of the meal as I proceed to pay the bill I'm told by the waitress ""I'm sorry but this card didn't go through."" This is a DEBIT bank card not a credit card so there was no reason for the error. Things happen no biggie I tell her to try it again. She gathers what I believe is the manager and after they huddle he returns with he same statement and further adds "" We can call Visa if you would like"" I've worked in retail for 15+ years so I know that terminology it's the same one numerous stores use when they suspect FRAUD. Hoping that's not the case I tell the manager it's a DEBIT bank card co calling Visa won't solve the issue, but I'll just goto the ATM outside and get cash. I do exactly that but right before I do I stop at the vendor booth in the middle of the mall and make a Credit purchase for almost the same amount as the bill in California Pizza Kitchen.I know banks have a daily spending limit as well as protection from out of the ordinary purchases but this bill was not that it was only 87 dollars.  I get cash and pay the bill but I feel I was racially profiled because I know the PR terms employees use when they suspect CC fraud and this waitress and manager were hitting all of them. The team huddles around he register, the offering to call the credit card company. These are not the exact terms they use but these are the tell tell signs from someone who has been on the other side of those team huddles at the register. I have taught numerous classes on ways to handle fraud situations in a retail environment. I feel that was wrong especially in front of my family. The only reason I'm writing this review because my wife begged me. I'm warning future patrons of this establishment DON'T eat at California Pizza Kitchen in the Westfield shopping mall if you are African American and plan on spending more that 30 bucks on there stale bread and nasty food.

I was extremely disappointed with the service as soon as we chose our seat. First of all they had two tvs in the self service seating area. That's fine. The only issue is they had one station playing commercials after the laker game ended. I first notified the bartender to change the channel. After a while I notified a waiter. After that didn't work I notified a barback. Before I knew it I had already told three employees we wanted the game and our first round of drinks haven't even arrived. We had been there for 20 minutes already!!! We all left and notified the manager. Horrible service.

I personally went online and put my order in. I asked for NO AVOCADO and chicken instead. When my hubby got there they messed up my order and put only avocado in it. The guy asked my hubby if he was sure I wanted chicken! Umm of course she wants chicken! I don't know why this guy was trying to persuade him into taking the salad made the way they choose to make it. It's a $15  salad... I want it the way I ordered it.    Anyways he came back later with my new salad but didn't bring my bread or utensils I had requested. My hubby didn't even get a bag. The guy again insisted he gave my hubby the bag with every thing in it! Which he did not. No apology or anything. This place lacks professionalism and has no ucustomer service skill. How hard is it to read an order and make it? Not only that,  we should've been compensated somehow. This isn't the first time they've screwed up our order. Last time they forgot half of my husband's order and never reimbursed him for it!   If you do take out double check your food. We will not be doing business with this location ever again.

They've added some more ""gourmet"" food to the menu like halibut, and salmon which is really refreshing. My go-to dishes are the Caesar salad with shrimp and the margarita pizza.

On one side note, I recently ate a lunch duo of the Super Spinach Quinoa Salad and a mini BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The salad had maybe three pieces of spinach.  It was pretty good, but found it odd that they named it Super Spinach.  LOL.  Also, on the mini pizzas, the crust to topping ratio is off.  You basically get one big bite (or two little ones) of toppings and then a piece of crust.  I used the olive oil from the bread service as a dipping sauce. On a second side note, this particular location has improved the quality of their alcohol.  There was a point when they had maybe 3 different types of vodka.  The top shelf was Goose, but then it went to Svedka and the well crap.  The bar is still not great, but at least it's getting better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=40,2.48,3.06,3.072,2.7,2.8280000000000003

I'm pretty much a creature of habit.  I like to start with a California Cobb, Thai Crunch or Chinese Chicken Salad.  For pizza I always get the BBQ Chicken or the Crispy Sicilian.  I remember them having a Peking Duck and a Roasted Rosemary Potato pizza that no longer exists.  I'm not fond of any of their sandwiches. On one side note, I recently ate a lunch duo of the Super Spinach Quinoa Salad and a mini BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The salad had maybe three pieces of spinach.  It was pretty good, but found it odd that they named it Super Spinach.  LOL.  Also, on the mini pizzas, the crust to topping ratio is off.  You basically get one big bite (or two little ones) of toppings and then a piece of crust.  I used the olive oil from the bread service as a dipping sauce. On a second side note, this particular location has improved the quality of their alcohol.  There was a point when they had maybe 3 different types of vodka.  The top shelf was Goose, but then it went to Svedka and the well crap.  The bar is still not great, but at least it's getting better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=40,2.84,3.1,3.068,2.8280000000000003,2.9960000000000004

We got seated and what we assumed to be our waitress came and asked for our drinks and a few minutes later for our food. Then, someone else brought us bread and the meal was brought out by a different waiter. It was as though our waiters changed and we were not notified. We got the Chinese chicken salad and were not given serving spoons to serve it, or plates as we had informed them that we'd be sharing it. Additionally, I had kindly asked them to put channel 2 on for the UCLA game and they did, but not long after they changed it to a different game and I was very annoyed as I had not left. Throughout the meal it felt like we were ignored and nonexistent as no one came to check on us and make sure we had everything. We had to ask the hostess for napkins and sauce and more water and that should have been our waiters duty. Then, after we finished our meal, we got dessert and they brought out extra spoons, but not extra plates for us to share. When the dessert was brought out, so was the bill and that made us feel like they wanted us kicked out. Lastly, when we were paying the bill the waiter couldn't wait one second for us to put the credit card in, which was in my hand, and left and retuned 3-4 minutes later.

Would surely recommend to anyone who loves pasta, good service and cheesecake!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=80,3.36,3.06,3.048,2.452,3.1800000000000006
212,Melissa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,1.0,1.0,2016-05-12,"My 23rd birthday fell the day after Mother's Day this year so my mom and I spent our Sunday (this May 8th) joint-celebrating. Even in LA with countless options for unique and fantastic cuisine, we opted for CPK. Why? Because we love it!! All I wanted was a meal I knew I could rely on, good unobtrusive service, and a mojito. But what I wanted most of all, was a lovely afternoon out with my mom. I worked as a sever for several years and understand what sets a great sever aside very well. Maybe too well. I would never give a server a hard time for attempting to develop a relationship with their tables or allowing their personality to show. However. There is a line that can be crossed and unfortunately it was. From the moment we were situated in the restaurant, our server piled on the up-selling SO much my mom and I practically felt we weren't allowed to order what we actually wanted. My mom ordered the cheapest glass of white wine. Instead of taking her order, our server so aggressively started selling her a different wine that she felt forced to say ""ok..."" I'll note that our server never mentioned the price of this wine. Also never mentioned that there were different pour options with different prices (6oz or 9oz, he took the liberty of assuming she'd opt for the 9oz). Now let me reiterate. I've done my time in the service industry. I know the importance of up-selling and I even know the feeling of a (really, really BAD) manager breathing down your neck to do so (a good manager never would). But it's completely inappropriate to mislead, misinform, or berate a customer in order to do so. And doing so with a smile on your face does not negate the fact that you are indeed doing so!! That glass of wine? TWICE the price of the original glass she ordered. Yeah, usually when people order the cheapest glass of house white, they did that on purpose. Next he finally asks for my drink order. Without pause I politely ordered a mojito, only to be nearly interrupted with more up-selling. This time for a completely different cocktail that I did not want. After way too long arguing back and forth, he finally accepted that I would be having a mojito and not what he wanted me to have. He checks our IDs and leaves. 5-8 minutes later (on the late-end of the time our drinks should have been arriving) our sever comes back and points to me: ""so... Your birthday is tomorrow, not today?"" I respond yes. To be completely honest, I was getting ready to hear ""happy early birthday, drink is on us!"" Nope. He proceeded to go on and on about how they absolutely cannot serve me until the day of my actual birthday------?!?!?!!!!???? ""you realize I am turning 23 tomorrow, not 21."" He then argues with me!!! He claims that he read the date ""May 9, 1993"" and even asked his manager (his MANAGER?!!!) and they both agreed that if I was born 5/9/1993 I was underage. I had to sit there explaining elementary math to this person when I should have been enjoying a private lunch with my mom. He then FINALLY agrees to go ""check the math again"" (wow..) and when he returned (obviously proven wrong) he just blamed the discrepancy on the manager. Nice. Clearly the whole flow of our lunch together was ruined at this point. And there were plenty of other frustrating nuances, trust me. Our appetizer was served long after our meals had arrived, our salmon was grossly overcooked, and of course there was some more invasive up-selling of their newest dessert.  I understand that Mother's Day is one of the busiest holidays for restaurants but we were one of the first people to arrive when they opened.  This was hands down one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant in general, and it happened at one of my all time favorites. So disappointed, shocked, and hesitant to ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=180,3.36,3.06,3.04,1.924,3.1800000000000006

I'm leaving this horrible review because of the service today.  We ordered online for pick up and we got there early and asked to switch to dine in so we could get drinks. After the girl at the register talks to her manager we were told we could take the food to go and eat it at a specific table. We asked if we could get some drinks and she said to take it to the bar.  We then waited for our food to get packaged to go...  all they had to do was not pack the food.... I'm not sure what's so complicated about this but we ended up having to take the food out of the bag and box at the bar to eat... Alex at the bar was awesome and agreed with us. He offered to get our food played for dine in instead but we insisted not to go through the hassle.  It's people like Alex who get companies the great reviews.   Unfortunately - it's things such as those in management who make it get nothing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=80,3.28,3.02,3.04,1.924,3.1240000000000006

With that being said, I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality of food at CPK. It's only been this past year that I've noticed how often my sister and I have eaten here by choice and convenience.  Our usual order consists of the following for both of us to share.... -Qunoa & Arugula Salad: a super-grain salad with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, toasted pine nuts and Feta tossed in their housemade Champagne vinaigrette. You get your choice protein (chicken, shrimp, or salmon) for an additional charge. However the salad is good as is. We don't order any protein. Everything about this salad is perfect. I love the peppery arugula, the slight pop-in-your-mouth quinoa, the chewy sun-dried tomatoes, the sharp red onion, the nutty pine nuts, and salty feta. This is easily my 2nd favorite salad (my absolute favorite salad is the Nicoise salad from Los Olivos Cafe--see my review). This salad is so effing good! -Roasted Artichoke & Spinach Pizza: a pizza with oven-roasted artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, sautéed spinach, Mozzarella and Parmesan. You can opt to include chicken, but the pizza is good as is. We don't include any chicken. This is hands down my favorite pizza at CPK. The flatbread pizza is the perfect vehicle for the combination of yummy ingredients. There is no pizza sauce, which I like since all the flavor is basically coming from the roast garlic, mozzerella, and parmesan. This pizza is so effing good! These dishes are fantastically delicious to the point where I find myself craving them.  ***My most recent dining experience at CPK was earlier today, with my sister lol***  I'm currently doing Whole30 (if you don't know what Whole30 is, it's basically a cleans but definitely google it for more information). Since I was unable to order the usual above items, I settled on the... -Roasted Garlic Chicken & Seasonal Vegetables: Pan-sautéed chicken breast in lemon-garlic sauce with hearth-roasted fingerling potatoes, cauliflower, Mediterranean herbs and seasonal vegetables. I was bummed that I could't order the Salad or the Pizza and I honestly didn't have high expectations about this Chicken dish. However when it was finally brought to our table, I was mind blown.  The chicken was juicy and well seasoned. The fingerling potatoes were crips on the outside but soft and mealy on the inside. The seasonal vegetables consisted of colored carrots, beets, and cauliflower all with a slight bite to them instead of being overcooked and mushy. It was basically this dish that made me want to write a Yelp review on just how good of a job CPK seems to be doing with their food.

We also order the BBQ Chicken Pizza with bacon and honestly the frozen version that you buy at the grocery store tastes so much better. You would think after his first or two mistakes he would step up this service...nope. The server is nice but he lacks server skills and experience. He the type of server you need to flag down to get his attention. Lacks customers service skills. He doesn't anticipate guest needs. UPDATE I got severe stomach pain and cramps after eating here.

97,A S.,"Los Angeles, CA",343,49,51.0,1.0,2016-09-03,"I frequent CPK often, especially the Westwood one as I go to UCLA. However, today I had the worst experience dining here. We got seated and what we assumed to be our waitress came and asked for our drinks and a few minutes later for our food. Then, someone else brought us bread and the meal was brought out by a different waiter. It was as though our waiters changed and we were not notified. We got the Chinese chicken salad and were not given serving spoons to serve it, or plates as we had informed them that we'd be sharing it. Additionally, I had kindly asked them to put channel 2 on for the UCLA game and they did, but not long after they changed it to a different game and I was very annoyed as I had not left. Throughout the meal it felt like we were ignored and nonexistent as no one came to check on us and make sure we had everything. We had to ask the hostess for napkins and sauce and more water and that should have been our waiters duty. Then, after we finished our meal, we got dessert and they brought out extra spoons, but not extra plates for us to share. When the dessert was brought out, so was the bill and that made us feel like they wanted us kicked out. Lastly, when we were paying the bill the waiter couldn't wait one second for us to put the credit card in, which was in my hand, and left and retuned 3-4 minutes later. Overall, this was the worst CPK dining experience that I have ever experienced and I do not plan on returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=100,2.36,2.83,3.032,2.212,2.6420000000000003

We then waited for our food to get packaged to go...  all they had to do was not pack the food.... I'm not sure what's so complicated about this but we ended up having to take the food out of the bag and box at the bar to eat... Alex at the bar was awesome and agreed with us.

527,Melissa S.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,15,1.0,1.0,2016-12-05,"My 23rd birthday fell the day after Mother's Day this year so my mom and I spent our Sunday (this May 8th) joint-celebrating. Even in LA with countless options for unique and fantastic cuisine, we opted for CPK. Why? Because we love it!! All I wanted was a meal I knew I could rely on, good unobtrusive service, and a mojito. But what I wanted most of all, was a lovely afternoon out with my mom. I worked as a sever for several years and understand what sets a great sever aside very well. Maybe too well. I would never give a server a hard time for attempting to develop a relationship with their tables or allowing their personality to show. However. There is a line that can be crossed and unfortunately it was. From the moment we were situated in the restaurant, our server piled on the up-selling SO much my mom and I practically felt we weren't allowed to order what we actually wanted. My mom ordered the cheapest glass of white wine. Instead of taking her order, our server so aggressively started selling her a different wine that she felt forced to say ""ok..."" I'll note that our server never mentioned the price of this wine. Also never mentioned that there were different pour options with different prices (6oz or 9oz, he took the liberty of assuming she'd opt for the 9oz). Now let me reiterate. I've done my time in the service industry. I know the importance of up-selling and I even know the feeling of a (really, really BAD) manager breathing down your neck to do so (a good manager never would). But it's completely inappropriate to mislead, misinform, or berate a customer in order to do so. And doing so with a smile on your face does not negate the fact that you are indeed doing so!! That glass of wine? TWICE the price of the original glass she ordered. Yeah, usually when people order the cheapest glass of house white, they did that on purpose. Next he finally asks for my drink order. Without pause I politely ordered a mojito, only to be nearly interrupted with more up-selling. This time for a completely different cocktail that I did not want. After way too long arguing back and forth, he finally accepted that I would be having a mojito and not what he wanted me to have. He checks our IDs and leaves. 5-8 minutes later (on the late-end of the time our drinks should have been arriving) our sever comes back and points to me: ""so... Your birthday is tomorrow, not today?"" I respond yes. To be completely honest, I was getting ready to hear ""happy early birthday, drink is on us!"" Nope. He proceeded to go on and on about how they absolutely cannot serve me until the day of my actual birthday------?!?!?!!!!???? ""you realize I am turning 23 tomorrow, not 21."" He then argues with me!!! He claims that he read the date ""May 9, 1993"" and even asked his manager (his MANAGER?!!!) and they both agreed that if I was born 5/9/1993 I was underage. I had to sit there explaining elementary math to this person when I should have been enjoying a private lunch with my mom. He then FINALLY agrees to go ""check the math again"" (wow..) and when he returned (obviously proven wrong) he just blamed the discrepancy on the manager. Nice. Clearly the whole flow of our lunch together was ruined at this point. And there were plenty of other frustrating nuances, trust me. Our appetizer was served long after our meals had arrived, our salmon was grossly overcooked, and of course there was some more invasive up-selling of their newest dessert.  I understand that Mother's Day is one of the busiest holidays for restaurants but we were one of the first people to arrive when they opened.  This was hands down one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant in general, and it happened at one of my all time favorites. So disappointed, shocked, and hesitant to ever return.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=180,2.56,2.78,2.976,2.084,2.692

Well, let me tell you fine folks of yelp something. I haven't had a pizza this bad in a while. Although not nearly as bad as the pizza I bought from ""dough girl"" (formerly know as: Nikkis pizza) as the owner harasses me on yelp from time to time, but I digress. This pizza was cold when I received it, and I can only imagine the look on the poor underpaid soul who was forced to construct this monstrosity. Pasty cold sauce , under cooked hard veggies , awful dough . While the components of this pizza are terrible I can't say much bad about the service as it was average. Nothing good, but nothing negative really, albeit understaffed although that's probably management's fault. Two people to sit guests, really?

Nothing really to write home about there. Staff is very friendly and the refills on drinks come in fast!  Only complaint I have is they don't really have a stroller parking area other than the very small front desk area. That means that area can become very crammed. You won't be able to find anywhere inside to wait for a table to be available. You'll be standing out in the mall because there are 3-4 strollers flanking both sides of the check in area.

I personally enjoy the indoor seating area that's in the middle of the mall versus the seating inside the actual restaurant. It's more open, has natural light from the sky lights above and doesn't feel as compact.  The pizza at CPK is made with fresh and tasty ingredients...Whether you are getting the plain ol' Cheese and Pepperoni, the classic BBQ Chicken Pizza or one of my favorites, the Thai Chicken Pizza, CPK has it figured out.  They have a nice selection of Soups, Salads & appetizers and if you feel like spending a few more dollars, definitely splurge for one of their tasty pasta dishes.  I've eaten at this location a handful of times and have placed pick up orders a few more than that. Whether being served at a table or from behind the to-go counter, the staff is always friendly and helpful. This CPK even offers a curbside pickup in which they will deliver to your car at a designated area in the Owensmouth parking structure.  On my most recent visit (Tuesday 3/7/2017) I ordered from their lunch special which was fairly priced and came with a smaller version of their normal sized pizza and a side specialty salad of my choosing.

Well, let me tell you fine folks of yelp something. I haven't had a pizza this bad in a while. Although not nearly as bad as the pizza I bought from ""dough girl"" (formerly know as: Nikkis pizza) as the owner harasses me on yelp from time to time, but I digress. This pizza was cold when I received it, and I can only imagine the look on the poor underpaid soul who was forced to construct this monstrosity. Pasty cold sauce , under cooked hard veggies , awful dough . While the components of this pizza are terrible I can't say much bad about the service as it was average. Nothing good, but nothing negative really, albeit understaffed although that's probably management's fault. Two people to sit guests, really?

353,Conor B.,"Chatsworth, United States",163,1350,106.0,4.0,2017-09-03,"I would've thought that being in a mall this location would be loud and crowded. And yes, this is the case from time to time but more often than not it's just the bar that's the loud/packed area. The restaurant itself is quite roomy and quiet enough that you don't have to yell to carry a conversation. That is a huge plus for me. Food is on par with all their other locations. Nothing really to write home about there. Staff is very friendly and the refills on drinks come in fast!  Only complaint I have is they don't really have a stroller parking area other than the very small front desk area. That means that area can become very crammed. You won't be able to find anywhere inside to wait for a table to be available. You'll be standing out in the mall because there are 3-4 strollers flanking both sides of the check in area. That's not cool. There also isn't really an area to keep them inside the restaurant. With the amount of families that frequent the mall. I really wish they had thought of that when designing the space.

356,Lance L.,"Thousand Oaks, United States",32,60,287.0,3.0,2017-09-03,"CPK is a great place to grab lunch or dinner if you are visiting the Westfield Topanga mall. I personally enjoy the indoor seating area that's in the middle of the mall versus the seating inside the actual restaurant. It's more open, has natural light from the sky lights above and doesn't feel as compact.  The pizza at CPK is made with fresh and tasty ingredients...Whether you are getting the plain ol' Cheese and Pepperoni, the classic BBQ Chicken Pizza or one of my favorites, the Thai Chicken Pizza, CPK has it figured out.  They have a nice selection of Soups, Salads & appetizers and if you feel like spending a few more dollars, definitely splurge for one of their tasty pasta dishes.  I've eaten at this location a handful of times and have placed pick up orders a few more than that. Whether being served at a table or from behind the to-go counter, the staff is always friendly and helpful. This CPK even offers a curbside pickup in which they will deliver to your car at a designated area in the Owensmouth parking structure.  On my most recent visit (Tuesday 3/7/2017) I ordered from their lunch special which was fairly priced and came with a smaller version of their normal sized pizza and a side specialty salad of my choosing. Complimentary bread and oil was brought to the table and our sever was very attentive during the course of our meal.  My recommendations for your next visit:  -White corn guacamole and chips -The Original Chopped Salad (with garbanzo beans) -Thai Chicken Pizza -Kung Pao Spaghetti pasta Enjoy!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-canoga-park-3?start=20,3.44,2.86,2.94,2.444,3.092

No one came to take our drink order for 15 minutes. We were not acknowledged nor assigned a waiter. We did not get bread brought to our table until we requested it, and not until AFTER our meal was brought to us. The restaurant was not even busy, so the lack of attention was uncalled for.

The food is always great here but what made this experience so great was our waiter Saul. He was very attentive, friendly, and on top of our order.

It's only a few extra dollars to me, but overall it is in your favor entirely and, if intentional, which it appears to be since it is stated on the receipt, a despicable practice in my opinion... please compute correctly: subtotal times gratuity percentage equals suggested gratuity. It is not typical to compute gratuity on the total, tax included, like you are doing... EVER. State sales tax is a collection of funds by the state government and not the goods/services that are being acknowledged/rewarded/compensated with a tip. Disclosure does not make a bad business practice good! In the end, it's my own fault.  I should be better at mental math but after a cocktail or two I just can't do it so I trusted you.

Got to say though, the vibe you feel in this place is so nice and color scheme will make you feel so relaxed. I think it just makes you buy more food cause that's what we did. For an appetizer, I just got the Chicken Dumplings and the sauce is delicious. I got the BBQ pizza and it was okay.  The waiter we had seated us friendly and always checked on us like for a good amount of time to make sure everything was alright. She brought the food in a swift manner and it was like so perfectly timed too because after I finished my appetizer, it would be like 10 minutes later for the main course to come. Pretty cool.
