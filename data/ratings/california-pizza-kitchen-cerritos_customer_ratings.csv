314,Anne G.,"Long Beach, CA",112,220,67.0,1.0,2012-01-28,"I love CPK'S food but I do not like this LOCATION! I had a very bad experience here and I have not been back to this CPK location since. The wait was long as was expected, but after awhile it got ridiculous so I went to the hostess to check on how much longer it'd be. The problem? THE HOSTESS COULDN'T FIND OUR NAME ON THE LIST??!? How is that possible? I stood there with another person from my party and WATCHED a hostess write down our name and how many in our party about a foot away. I am still baffled to this day as to how that page just ""disappeared."" After I tried to calmly explain to her that someone had written our name down and we should have been called already, she agreed to fit us in when she could. There was no sense of urgency and no apologizing on their part. They clearly messed up and ""lost"" our names and acted like nothing happened and like we didn't just wait an extra amount of time because of their mistake. I asked for some kind of compensation like a free appetizer or something but was merely brushed off. I did not feel like a valued customer at all. Needless to say, my friends and I were all upset by this time and we did not have an enjoyable dinner. This was about a year ago and I have not set foot at this CPK location since this horrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=300,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9160000000000004,3.0000000000000004

255,Keith H.,"Whittier, CA",59,30,45.0,4.0,2012-03-05,Christopher was an awesome server. The only thing he kinda messed up on was our soufflé; it was kinda left for a little while and the ice cream melted but eh it was still good! I hate that my girlfriend and I get stereotyped as that young couple that doesn't know how to tip and we get poor service at restaurants we dine at but we both have worked at restaurants before and know how to tip so I hate that we get stereotyped and get neglected by some servers. Christopher was not one of these servers and we left him 20% tip. I wish the manager didn't stereotype us and came to ask us how our meal was tasting. He went to all the tables around us and table touched them but neglected to see how we were doing. Shame shame...

I usually opt for the wild mushroom pizza or the margherita which are super good.  I went last night and had the white pizza with spinach. It has 5 kinds of cheese (yummm) and sauteed spinach. They asked me if I wanted smoked bacon and I couldn't say no I had to try it and let me say that it's delish!!! bacon, spinach and cheese is one of my new favorite combinations. The server was really attentive, it was my Mom's Birthday so they took her a free sundae and I ordered the six layer lemon cake and that thing is unreal!!! Next time I will just have cake and finish the whole thing.

The salads are great, but for some reason they don't have the shrimp miso salad here, which is available still at other locations.

The food was just eh and the service was awful (not to mention having to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table). Ohhhhh but just wait, it gets worse..... We leave and I realize that I accidentally left my son's pictures with Santa Clause on the table (my fault, I admit it). Run back inside and they check in their little server stand and tell me its not there. The hostess asks the bus boy and he claims not to have seen anything. No apology, no anything at all. They acted as though it was completely my fault. Umm......okay...... I walk outside and I'm crying because I'm so upset and my husband goes back in and demands to speak to the manager. He calmly explains the situation and the manager just sorta shrugs and tells him that they looked but he (my husband) can go check the dumpster if he'd like. (SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!)

Flavorful yet light and packed with roasted veggies.  Definitely not chincy at all, however they over did it on the sun dried tomatoes.  There was just an over abundance of them.  I finished about 3/4 of the salad.  I could not even imagine how someone would finish a full-sized salad.  I'm assuming the full-sized salad would be great for groups.   Caesar Salad - Your typical caesar.  Not the healthiest salad, but nonetheless it's declicious.

The patio is upgraded and now has fire pits! A great place to go to just hang out with your friends to drink and eat. They have small dishes available if you're not that hungry.

Other than that, CPK is deplorably below average in its preparation of American food. Every dish they serve is overly salted and lacks any delicate flavor.

241,Dayvid N.,"Long Beach, CA",3,32,9.0,4.0,2013-02-10,"Full house on a Saturday afternoon, but surprisingly the wait was less then 15 minutes. Gotta give them recognition for trying their best to get us seated ASAP. The waiting seats are outside so make sure the hostess can see you so they won't think you up and left. The nice girl called us back in not long after we put our name on the wait list and we were stationed at the back right table. My girl and I ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer which tasted good. The dip wasn't too salty nor bland and it came with black and white colored tortilla chips. Nice little filler before our entree. My 2 fish taco was great. I added a dollar more for avocado on it, but it could do without next time because the taco was already good as is. They added shredded cabbage in the taco with some really good dressing on it. It's probably simple to make I'm sure with mayonnaise being the main ingredient I assume. The fish look like it was breaded a bit and grilled to a brown and served on a flour tortilla. My dish came with more of those tortilla chips and salsa. If you haven't tried it yet make way for it next time. My Hun ordered the Barbecue Chicken Pizza. It was small sized and had I think six slices. Though small, it still was big enough to feed two people with little a little stomach like myself and my babe. Not bad I say. It was sprinkled with onions and cilantro or chives I think. The pizza definitely stuffed us and we started having regrets ordering the appetizer, but not because it wasn't good, but it was too much food for us at the end. The total came out around $38 (no drinks, just water), but we didn't even flinch because my girlfriend's friend hooked us up with a gift card so all we paid for was the difference. Our waitress was really kind and came over to us frequently to make sure we did fine so we tipped her generously for her service. Considering it's a Saturday and packed they still did a great job maneuvering through obstacles and we came out as full and happy customers.       :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=280,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.184,3.5200000000000005

Few years back, one of my fav dishes, Thai Chicken Pasta, was completely taken off the menu. They also added some new dishes then, too. (I think the Cajan Jambalaya, I think...)  Fine. I get it--changing times, changing tastes buds...   Then today, I took my mom and my 2 kids to CPK for lunch. We ordered the Original BBQ Pizza, Waldorf Salad, Spicy Kung Pao Spaghetti and Spaghetti Bolognese. Pizza and the Bolognese was ok...the usual. But what happened to the Kung Pao Spaghetti and Waldorf Salad???  the spaghetti didnt have the same spicy taste; the shrimp was battered very thick n deep fried (which ended up being mushy by the middle of the meal); and the Waldorf was a wilted n brown--some parts of the spring lettuce; there was waaaaay to much crumbled cheese which over powered the simple dressing and the grapes were sadly mushy and not crisp. Another change:  the regular bread and butter has been replaced by a crispy baguette type bread with a side of olive oil which had pieces of parsely(?), garlic(?) and pepper flakes. The taste of the oil was very different. I'm still trying to figure out the ingredients are.  Overall, the service is good.

My grilled veggie salad was a full plastic container of lettuce (still very wet and watery) and some avocado.  That's it.  Clearly the other plastic container of actual grilled veg was forgotten somewhere, so I paid $13.50 for fifty cents worth of wet lettuce.  The bread bags with oil and vinegar all had open containers of oil, so those all went into the trash immediately. Utensils for three people, party of four.  I understand mistakes happen, but it's not like I could have my waitress bring my missing food or a fresh fork.  It's TAKE OUT. It should be triple checked before it exits the building.

We were a party of about thirty (to begin with) and eventually had more than 30 people. I thought they offered cheerful (although harried) service, and tried to get every person's order correct. That's a Herculean feat. (That's really a 4+ stars grade). Now, since we were such a large group, we were seated outside. That would normally be okay, but it was quite chilly this evening, we really were counting on the patio heaters to be in working order. About half of our group sat under a heater that was out of order. That made their dinner quite uncomfortable. There was no possibility  of moving the large group inside. (at least I do not believe it was offered at any time).  (Downgrade to 2 stars) I also got the Wine Flight ( a choice of three whites) : I really need my server to tell me what is being served, and she did not know which was which. Except to say: ""it's what's on the menu!"" Hello? If I knew that , then I would have kept the menu!  I think it  is  part of the server's or waiter's job to know what they are serving Plus be able to answer customer's questions a little more. I know it's a chain restaurant but that would distinguish restaurant service from a drive-through! (2 stars) Food wise: got the white pizza - best of course consumed right out of their hot oven. (Five cheeses, spinach  and optional bacon). Quite delicious! Pasta choice: Asparagus & Spinach spaghettini with added shrimp - really good! Lightly dressed with olive oil & garlic, Not greasy or heavy which just fit the bill for after Christmas Day dinner. Both choices were split between myself & my mom, plus brought home the rest - enough for another lunch! (3 Stars) Recommend: fix the patio heater please!

FOOD: Our group ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Decent. Nothing really special about it. 3/5. I had ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pizza on wheat (tricking myself into thinking its healthier because its made of wheat hehe). My girlfriend had the california cobb pizza, also on wheat. The spicy chipotle chicken pizza had a nice kick of spice and an array of flavors- basically a salsa on top of a pizza. 4/5 The cobb pizza is decent. The bitterness of the arugula works well with the salty bacon, though i had a hard time finding the bacon. 3/5 The prices are a little on the high side. $15 for each pizza. For that price, you can get a whole large pizza from Costco, though one can argue that CPK's pizza's are ""gourmet"". Overall 3/5 SERVICE: Our waitress was nice and frequently checked up on us. Water was always filled without even requesting. Food was served pretty fast, especially the appetizer. Overall 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: Despite the fact that we were seated next to a family with a baby who couldn't stop banging the silverware against the ceramic plate, the place is very chill atmosphere. It can fill the role of a casual date restaurant to a family dinner. A lot of 2-seat tables and enough tables for large groups. Decor is clean and simple.

Upon telling the three hostesses that we'd like a booth for two, they told us they could only seat us on the patio. I let them know we'd like a booth, and that there are plenty available, and to deny us one is illegal. They tell me the patio is all they can give us, I say if that is so, then I can call the police and they can assure them otherwise. Confused? This CPK is not educated on ADA regulations, California penal codes, and Guide Dogs in general. After mentioning police, and dealing with backtalk from two hostesses, we were finally seated at a half booth. *The one hostess told me the other had never encountered a guide dog, and that she didn't know how to handle it, yet they both stood their ground on the outdoor patio bit for a while. When we were seated, my mom was fuming. *She's had guide dogs for 20+ years and dealt with this for as long as she's had them. You'd think by 2014 this type of harassment and barring would be over, especially with major companies.

The jicama, basil, cilantro, bits of tortilla strips, tomatoes, scallions, Monterey Jack & herb ranch made this salad look like the main entree.  *Red Velvet Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream: Cool, sweet, moist cake. The combination with Vanilla ice cream increases the flavor of the cake.  Service: Decent adequate service on a busy night. Professional & friendly staff.  Cons: -1 *Peach Iced Tea: Too sweet. Second try, too watery with no flavor.  Final Thoughts: If I can't make it to Bottega Louie, then this place is my go-to spot for pizza and salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=80,3.36,3.37,3.37,3.088,3.366

First of all you should know this was my second time coming to have dinner here (Cerritos) and although it might seem like I'm jumping into the gun in giving this location a bad review I often visit CPK in Lakewood (Mall) at least 3 to 4 times every two weeks. This review is in comparison to the Lakewood location, I always order the same thing which is the Ribeye Steak ""it is sooooo good...from the Lakewood CPK"". Ok so from the point the waiter took our order it took way to long to receive the food I would say roughly 30 minutes twice as long as it would have taken in the Lakewood location. Even getting the drinks took to long!! The steak was dry no flavor at all the only good thing about that night was the arugula, that was good. If you ever want to try the Ribeye I suggest you visit the Lakewood location, the steak there is so much better.

It was not on the menu, but our waiter JORGE ensured me they could do it. Once I got my sandwich it was the WRONG one. When I told our waiter that this actually wasn't what I wanted he did NOT apologize?! His response was that it was ""the same"". Sorry - a piece of chicken, pickles, and tomatoes, is not the same as a chicken Caesar salad. Apparently our waiter didn't care. He charged us for food I did not even eat, and didn't offer a discount, nor did he ask if I wanted something else instead? Needless to say, I won't be going back. He didn't even have time to bring us our check, another gal did. It was a pretty slow Wednesday night so I'm not sure why? Incredibly disappointed with my service.

While food has always tasted amazing despite the area, this review is for the deplorable customer service particular for this location. My family and I came here on a Saturday night and working in a restaurant myself, my tolerance usually gives leeway to rookie mistakes. But man was it stretched by the service here. I ordered a salad and an appetizer while my family ordered regular entrees as our meals. Everything but the appetizer made it out within 15 minutes, which was great, but by the time we were finishing up the last bites of our main dishes, the appetizer had yet to arrive. Our waiter Jorge never came by to check up on us or to refill our drinks; I had to get up and physically find him to ask him where my appetizer was. He assured me only a couple of minutes. A runner comes by with a plate of quesadillas. Not our order. Another runner comes by with a huge pepperoni pizza. Nope, not my order again. Jorge came by to apologize about the wrong order, again repeating a couple of minutes. I'm confused why something listed as an appetizer would take this long to make. He brings the check as the appetizer finally comes out, like it was his last performance and he seems proud of himself. I would've been too... if he had brought us the right check. Our party of 4 was stuck with a $20 check for a good while before we flagged him down to tell him that it wasn't the right check. He looks at us confused and said, ""What did you guys order again?"" Are you kidding me? Look it up in your computer and check the table number and realize the check that says 1 guest obviously isn't us. I was tempted to tip nothing for a waiter who didn't give a fig about us but my mother, the gracious woman, told me not to do and he received a 15% tip despite being an awful waiter.

I get there about 8:40 and call them to let them know I'm waiting at the curbside parking. The hostess answers and transfers me to take out. The damn phone rings for about 3 mins before I hang up. I can't imagine how CPK could allow their phone in the take out area to ring for 3 mins! I know the phone could be put on silent but that's unacceptable, especially they know people place take out orders. So I hang up after about 3 mins of ringing. I call back and get transferred again and this time it rings for about 2 mins before someone answers. So 5 mins of listening to the damn phone ring and I finally get someone to answer. At this point I'm really irritated. I could've walked into the place and just picked up my food (which I should have just done in the first place) Anyway the guy answers and says he'll be out right away...10 mins later I call back into the restaurant to see where my food is and as I'm on hold again with take out the guy shows up to my car with my LUKE WARM food. When I order curbside I usually tip, however this was one time I chose not to. 2 Stars for you today CPK.

I have been a regular at this restaurant for many years, though most often I use this location for takeout (it's on the way home from work). (1) The parking spaces reserved for takeout customers are USUALLY occupied by mall patrons who have no association with CPK takeout.  I have brought this problem to the attention of the restaurant's management REPEATEDLY, but to no avail. They are either unable or unwilling to take action to remedy the situation.  Last night I had to park approx. 1/4 mile from the restaurant to collect my takeout order. I cannot imagine even the most indifferent of restaurant management would consider that acceptable.  (2) Though the restaurant was not particularly busy yesterday (it was late afternoon on New Year's Eve, after all), it required nearly an hour from the time I placed the order until I walked out of the restaurant with my order.  Again, I cannot bring myself to imagine this would be deemed acceptable.  (3) Finally, my spouse ordered the ribeye steak, prepared medium well.  What was provided turned out to be EXCEPTIONALLY well done (and not in the good way ... think shoe leather).

Free small plate for Pizza Dough Rewards members   Not being a frequent customer of California Pizza Kitchen, I can count the number of times I've visited on one hand.  However, I've always been happy with the food I've had here.   Thanks to the avant garde imagination of Ed LaDou, who first made a name for himself at Wolfgang Puck's Spago, CPK offers up very non-traditional styles of pizza, along with pasta & other bites.  The Cerritos Mall location has been a longstanding tenant throughout the years, affording an opportunity for mall goers in search of more sophisticated fare.   The Original BBQ chicken is what first made CPK famous.  For newbies, this is what I recommend first.  I've also enjoyed the roasted garlic chicken, the Thai chicken & the Jamaican jerk chicken.  My absolute fav would have to be the roasted garlic & artichoke.  Simple, elegant & mouth-wateringly good.  I don't eat artichoke very often, so having this reminds me how great that vegetable is.   I've had the spinach artichoke dip appetizer and I melted with the first bite.  Gooey, rich & great to share, this is not one to pass up.   The plate I chose to redeem for my free small plate was the white corn guacamole.  Avocado, sweet white corn, black beans, jicama, bell pepper, cilantro & serrano peppers.  The guacamole was less in quantity than I would've liked, and consisted more of the white corn kernels where, I believe, more avocado would've been ideal.  Nevertheless, it was creamy & delicious.     CPK has lunch duos to attract the lunch crowd.  A full bar with libations of various sorts for those looking for a tipple.     A good amount of seating inside, with booths & bar seating.  Al fresco dining for those looking for some fresh air.  The take-out area is on the left of the restaurant.  Service has been quick & efficient all the times I've visited.   Parking is at the eastside of the Los Cerritos Center.  California Pizza Kitchen is one of the better quality chains to dine at.  Interesting menu selections, good service & convenient location will always keep CPK as a potential place to eat when I'm debating what culinary stop I want to hit up next.

It's consistently good This time around, we tried their other entrée meal (not pizza, salad or pasta).  Fire Grilled Ribeye - ""12oz usda choice ribeye grilled with housemade pinot noir sea salt and topped with creamy bleu cheese butter. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic wild arugula salad"" Surprisingly Good! It's thinner than what I usually get, but the temp and taste was spot on. I love the bleu cheese butter, yum!! Hearth Roasted Halibut - ""Wild caught alaskan halibut roasted on a cedar plank with grilled asparagus and butternut squash farro & baby kale"" the salmon was good, but the other components of this dish shined the brightest. The butternut squash and farro were outstanding. It elevated this ho hum dish to yum, yum, YUM!!  My other favorites here: Jerk Chicken Pizza The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza Pear Gorgonzola Pizza Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Dog friendly! Seating in the patio.  Service was very good. When our four legged son get's water before we do, I love it. Our waitress was super helpful and patient with us  FYI - I really liked the patio seating here. They have a glass wall. You can't smell the cigarette smoke while you're eating. Lazy Dog next door is also dog friendly and has a patio (no wall), but we were constantly down wind from the cigarette smoke, no bueno for me. CPK get's the nod for smoke free patio experience.  Price for the entrées were very pricey (compared to the pizza, pasta & salad) but worth it for the quality and taste.  Trying a new thing at an old standby joint I like and it paid off.

I asked for more when my order took so long, but that along with the sauce was being cooked for so long, that I gave it up. It was such a disappointment. When I asked to cancel my order that's when my server said oh it's out. But I was so tiered at this point that I just wanted to leave. That's when my daughter threw up what she ate.

The service is so bad I can't even believe it.  The host didn't smile at all and asked me more than twice whether anyone else would be joining me. No I just wanted to eat alone that day.  My server was worse though. I'm not sure the server I had understands how she sounds when she talks. She came up to me right when I was seated and said ""what do you want to eat?"" I told her I just sat down. She replied with ""uh so you're not ready yet?""  I got the Mac n cheese bites small plate and that was one of the best parts of my meal. It was very yummy.  I asked my server for hot sauce. She never brought it. When I finished my cheese bites she asked if I still wanted it.  Then my kung Pao spaghetti arrived and it tasted like pure soy sauce. I ate a couple bites and just couldn't eat any more of it. It was oily and salty and didn't have good flavor.  At that point the server just brought me my check. Without asking if I wanted dessert or if I needed anything else. And yes, I did want to get a dessert. She asked what I wanted and I said I wanted to see a dessert menu first. I got a soufflé cake and it was so delicious. But my servers attitude the whole meal was ridiculous. When she brought me the check the second time she kept telling me she would cash me out like she expected me not to pay. Is that standard procedure? To tell your customer repeatedly that they need to pay?  I even saw a guy walking around checking on people (he seems like the manager) but he didn't stop to check in on me.

I wish they weren't afraid to use more than a teaspoon as our pasta was rather dry.

The spinach artichoke dip was very cheesy and hot and comes with chips for scooping all the goodness.  Italian Chopped Salad - Roasted turkey breast, julienned salami, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, Mozzarella and fresh basil tossed in mustard herb vinaigrette. My wife enjoys salads and she like this one. She really enjoyed the light dressing.  Cedar Plank Salmon - North Atlantic salmon roasted on a cedar plank in our hearth oven with smoked paprika and lime.

CPK has their own free WIFI. -Fresh menu items. If you haven't been to CPK in years, they have a lot more healthy menu options now, and some are seasonal. I like their classic California club pizza on wheat dough (basically a BLTA pizza) which is lighter and more guilt free than your standard pizza. My mom and I also ordered the Santa Fe chicken bowl for the first time and were pleasantly surprised.

Just get the mushroom strozzapreti or a pizza for around the same price.

I waited for a long time in line to even speak to the person in charge of the takeout line. Once it was my turn I told her that I was here to pick up an order. I told her who the name of the person I was picking it up for and she never received that order. Apparently she didn't sign on or turn on the machine that prints out orders that's why she didn't receive any orders. That was fine to me, I understands stuff like that happens. As I was waiting for like what seemed to be hours never once did she acknowledge me waiting for a long period of time. No ""thank you for waiting"" or ""you're good will be out soon"". However, I did over hear her talking bad about a recent customer. Sounds very professional huh? Finally, after a long wait my order is done. You'd think all of that was bad? Well, when she gave me my order she had the nerve to blame me! She said ""next time say you're from door dash instead of telling me the name because that'll confuse me on the order"". Bro, your machine didn't even print out the order so I would've waited long whether I said I was picking up an order for door dash, Shelly, or even my name. Do not blame me.

52,Lora M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,20,3.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"Honestly, some of the worst delivery service I've ever experienced. I have tried multiple times to give this location second, third and fourth chances. No luck. If you need food by a certain time, say, for scheduled business meetings, DO NOT order from this location.  First time they messed up, order was 30 mins late. Second time, it was OVER AN HOUR LATE. Their excuse was that they didn't have enough people to deliver that day, so took it upon themselves to decide that it was ok to just bring the food when convenient for them. Today, our order was delayed (not even ready for pick up until the scheduled delivery time) because they couldn't handle a modification that was made at 9am, for an 11:45 delivery....  So my advice to you, CPK would be to not allow customers to select a delivery time. If you can't make it happen, don't offer the service. I will do everything I can to make sure the company I work for does not spend another dollar at your location.

They are personal pizzas, each with 6 slices, and since the crust is somewhat thin (depending on the person you get) youre more than likey to finish it and be full. Waiter was good, as soon as the drinks went down she was there ready to offer a refill. I liked watching the chef prepare the pizza infront of us. Its pretty cool watching him stretch the dough, and because its just one guy making all the pizzas i understand that it takes a little time for your food to arrive.
