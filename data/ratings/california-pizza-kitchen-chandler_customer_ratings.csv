72,Tomio O.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,3.0,5.0,2012-06-10,"Wow, first I need to say how impressed we were with the service we received at this location in Chandler for California Pizza Kitchen. We started out with a significantly less than stellar experience after we were seated on the patio on yet another ""warm"" Arizona day. We requested to be seated in another area after we sat for several minutes for no service attention from anyone. We were immediately re-seated in Sareena's section and were treated to an incredible service experience to correct the experience we previously had. The restaurant manager Jennifer Hawkins also paid us a visit in no time at all with some complimentary and remarkably delicious treats. After an impressive customer service experience we felt there was no other way to review this location and staff with nothing less than 5 stars despite the initial impression and experience. Kudos to Jennifer and Sareena for going above and beyond to more than exceed our experience. Thank you very much for spoiling us today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.156,3.4800000000000004

45,Amanda G.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,26,,4.0,2012-12-17,"I will admit that I am kind of a pizza snob. I've had great pizza from it being homemade or from the big city. The last two chain pizzerias I had been to were awful so I was very wary about eating here. I was really impressed with the pizza I ordered the thin crusted ""Sicilian"" with capicola ham, salami, sausage, and topped with fresh basil. It was the best pizza I had eaten in a long time and the person accompanying me had chosen a very good pie too. They had a Hawaiian style barbeque chicken pizza that I though was awesome even though that is not something I would typically order. The service was good. It was kind of cold in the sense that it wasn't personal or very friendly, yet it was very fast and efficient. The pizza was good, but I can't imagine ordering anything other than that off the menu. I'll definitely be back for some pizza in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9600000000000004,3.4800000000000004

Not last night.  We came here for dinner,I was very tired after a long day of work. I just wanted Ice Tea. No alcohol,which I very rarely drink anyway. T went to wash her hands and asked me to order her a hot water with lemon. When our server Sareena came over and I gave her the drink order, she seemed miffed we did not want alcohol. She kept saying ,""you don't want any Cocktails??? When did CPK become the boozing place, Anyway, she brought out the Ice tea and hot water, however, no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top. It is a glass coffee mug ,it has a handle. Why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups.???  T had to go to get lemon and napkins. She never asked her if she wanted more Hot water,but she did refill my Ice Tea. We ordered the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Which was great ,but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted. It has 2 choices.  Plus she never brought us bread, we had to ask for it. I got the Fish Tacos and they were quite good made with Mahi. T got the Kung Pao Pasta, with Shrimp. I sampled that as well and it was awesome. However, Sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash. The manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us. Even the table behind us,yelled out to her, hey can we get some bread! I do not agree with that, but clearly she did not know the proceedure. When T asked for more hot water,as she was not offered any.  Our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure. IT HAS A HANDLE,WHY ARE YOU FINGERING THE CUPS!  Of course T was freaked out,because she is such a germ aphobe anyway. But even I do not understand why you would serve a glass or cup like that.

I had to wait at the door to be greeted... then was taken to a table. I literally sat there for 10 minutes before ANYONE came to the table to greet me or ask if I would like a beverage. And, to top it off, it was the hostess who came over because she noticed that no one had come over to me yet.  She got my iced tea, and I saw her to over to a group of 3 waiters/waitresses who were standing in a group talking (I assume to tell someone that I was waiting). It took another 5 minutes before anyone came over. We were picking up our purses to leave when the waiter finally came over. He never apologized for the wait.  I can't complain about the food. I got a sandwich and it was good... but the food at CPK is not my issue.

My last visit to this location provided medocure service (at best) and a gummy under cooked pizza and a somewhat wilted salad. I have to say that this trip that both the service and the food were markedly improved. Funny, but I went to a pizza place but strangly enough I typically don't seem to order pizza. I decided to try one of their new salads, the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken. I totally loved the combination of (roasted) butternut squash, dates, avocado, almonds, beets, egg and cranberries.

Over the years we've seen many changes but whenever the original founders were at the helm you could always count on fantastic food and service. Unfortunately Larry and Rick are no longer involved and it shows. Traditional favorites that established their fame, like Thai chicken pizza and chicken tequila fettuccine,  have been changed, and the service no longer has that CPK panache. We hoped the new corporate management would finally get it, but they seem to think they know better than two of the most successful restauranteurs in history.

5,Rashmi G.,"Chandler, AZ",551,418,906.0,1.0,2014-09-11,"One star for this restaurant for the delicious Tequila Fettucine ... No additional stars for anything else. We decided to stop by CPK because I had a gift card and also had pretty high expectations because I've dined at other CPK locations. We were seated promptly when we walked inside and it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress came by to introduce herself & from that moment, we were pretty put off by her attitude but kept an open mind. The service we received from her did not improve .. in fact, it just got worse. CPK has a pretty extensive menu so it was taking us a few minutes to decide what we wanted to get. It wasn't as though we were holding up other customers from being seated while taking our time, since, as I mentioned before, it was not busy at all - only a few of the tables had patrons the whole time we were there. We had to wait for a while for her to return to ask if we wanted anything else and she was very frazzled the whole time, running back and forth. From what we could see, she was only waiting 2 tables. Anyways, so long story short, we were very displeased on that front. Moving on to the food. We ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine (substituted chicken for shrimp) and the Garlic Fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms. Both were good. The Garlic Fettuccine was lacking any flavor other than garlic but the chicken & mushrooms tasted good in it. We enjoyed both of those dishes so we thought we'd order some dessert. We decided to try some Beligian Chocolate Souffle Cake. It came out pretty quickly but we were horribly disappointed as it was served to us on a dirty plate. There were little food particles that had clearly dried up on it ... something that shouldn't have made it to our table. Considering that they were pretty obvious to us & we flagged down the manager right away to show him, it should've been pretty obvious to the person who put it on the plate as well. The manager asked us if we'd like another one or something else instead but at that point, we were done. It made us second guess the quality control of things that are being served at this restaurant, so I'm not sure we'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.5320000000000005,3.2400000000000007

The manager opened the door for us on the way in, and checked on us during the meal, which is awesome.  The staff was all super friendly, and service was fast. What this location lacks is any kind of personality. It's clean and bright, but doesn't leave you wanting to hang out, and nothing in the dining room is unique enough to leave a lasting impression, which I guess it what it comes down to.

After the food came out, we were talking and had a few bites and I saw a cockroach climbing up the wall of her booth. I told my friend, who responded by turning to look at it and backing away. We called over the nearest waiter-we were sitting next to the cash register- and when she came over we told her and pointed to the roach. She looked at it and said oh well they bombed Wednesday, and walked away. Then when our waitress came by and asked how we were doing, I told her they had a bug problem, and she said well all the restaurants here do, the bugs come inside when it's hot. She then walked away also. My friend was paranoid and didn't want the roach to climb on her or near the food, and  she lost her appetite and stopped eating for the rest of the time there.

I, along with my brother ordered a Pepperoni pizza and the Baja chicken. Kept it simple. After waiting for about a half hour for our food + (no concern nor a check in from our waitress) I approached her and asked if she could check on our order. She explained that they were short on cooks in the kitchen (which I understand, things happen). She explained that she would go and check in. After that she never returned, no update on our food nor a refill for our drinks. After about 50 minutes of waiting, a man who I'm assuming was the manager came up to us and said that he was sorry about the wait and that our dinner would be paid for. Our food did not come out for another 10 minutes, we waited about a total of one hour for a small sized pepperoni pizza and an appetizer on a Monday afternoon. I work as a waitress at a breakfast café, so I understand that these things are bound to happen, but that does not excuse the poor service I received today. It was only correct that our food was paid for. I did not enjoy myself, I did not feel like we were taken serious as customers and the food unfortunately did not make up for it.

The food is always consistent and the service good. If I have to eat at a chain I like this restaurant.  Here's the thing though-My husband and I ate at this location approximately 3 weeks ago and what happened is still bugging me so I need to write a review. We were about 3/4 into our meal and I was watching the kitchen. I enjoy watching the kitchen, being a former server you see things other's miss. So here goes, I see a food runner pick up a pizza. She's older mid 40's probably with short grey hair and black glasses. As she is walking she looks at the pizza and picks something off of the pizza. I see a cheese string stretch from the item to its origins on the pizza (I did not know what it was I assumed it was paper or something). She takes a couple of steps and puts the item IN HER MOUTH. At this point I cannot see the woman's mouth but assume she swallowed it, I am watching her back like a hawk. She drops the pizza in front of a man on the other side of the restaurant. After a couple of sentences exchanged between the two I see her head toward us and i'm just staring at her slack jawed. She headed back into the kitchen and I see her grab a napkin and wipe the cheese grease off her offending food stealing hand.  My husband looks at me concerned, he obviously believed I was going into early labor or something. I informed him of what happened and he just looked disgusted. We sign our check and leave. I WAS TRAUMATIZED, I had no idea what to do. I thought I had hallucinated.  But I had NOT hallucinated this actually happened and I probably will not eat here again.

The apps came out pretty quick and were descent, so quick in fact that our apps came out before our drinks. We had to have waited at least 15 minutes to get our drinks delivered because it appeared that the waiter had to mix the drinks himself. Speaking of which $11 for a cocktail in chandler seams a little much. The food wait time was pretty long as well probably about an hour wait, so long that we almost left. Worst of all, between getting our drinks and getting our food, probably 30-40 minutes, our waiter never visited our table. In fact we saw him visiting another table repeatedly without once coming to ours. Within this time I decided to grab the server's craft of water to fill our glasses for the first time. Then ten minutes later I grabbed it again but it was empty so I grabbed the tea craft because I was sick of waiting and very thirsty. This occurred one more time ten minutes later at which point our server finally came to check on us and said jokingly as I poured our glasses full of tea, tea that we didn't order or pay for, that he was sorry for the wait and that he wouldn't add the tea to our bill. I thought yeah no kidding you don't mention the tea and I won't mention the terrible service.  I've been a server so I know the struggles and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but not checking on a table for 30-40 minutes is REALLY bad.

We were initially being helped by a lady server but she had to switch with the super tall, dark gentleman that was working the bar area. He was so busy doing other things (getting people drinks, working the register, talking to people at the bar) that our lunch turned into an almost 2 hour lunch. We never got refills on water until I had to flag him down and then he filled up 2 of the 4 empty water cups and walked away. He then said he was going to bring us bread and disappeared for like 20 minutes. We ordered 4 pasta dishes and the cook put the plates out for our server to bring to our table and we literally sat there for a really long time watching our food get cold while our server was by the bar talking to other customers and doing other things behind the bar. When we got our food, he never came around to ask how things were and when we needed our check and some boxes, he was nowhere to be found. The worst part of all, when we did pay and he processed the credit card and came back, he did this martial arts bow to us like we were supposed to be impressed by that and thanked us for coming in. My family is Asian so that's pretty inappropriate to do and I didn't see him bowing to his other white customers. Really ignorant, but what can you do? The food was ok, we ordered the pesto penne pasta, the jambalaya pasta, the kung pao speghetti, and the garlic fetticcini alfredo. The pesto penne tasted ok but the pasta wasn't cooked and was still hard. It wasn't even al dente, it was still uncooked and that made the dish hard to eat. The jambalaya pasta was good, seasoned well and had good flavor. The garlic alfredo was also good but was a tad on the salty side. The kung pao speghetti was pretty good for a pizza restaurant. It was super spicy and saucy.  Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to.

37,Lisa B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,28,,2.0,2017-06-05,not impressed-- pizza was very greasy-- servers were very young not paying attention to our drinks or needs thru the meal.  Salad ok but skimpy on the chicken-- will probably not go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
29,Melanie E.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,65,28.0,3.0,2017-06-19,"I probably had the strangest experience here. I went on a Friday afternoon about 1PM with a group of 6. Our food was good, but the service was nothing to brag about.  For starters, the ice in our glasses was 3/4 of the way full so we constantly needed refills. At one point, we had put one of the empty glasses near the front of the table for the waitress to grab and hopefully refill, and she actually said, ""let's save the ice"" while pouring that ice into someone else's glass nearby!! She proceeded to refill the glass with the 'saved' ice.   When we were about done eating we noticed another group about our size sat down on the other side of the booth and left before receiving any service. Since there were 3 middle school aged boys with us, we asked if those people stated that we were the cause or something else (the people didn't seem to be there for long). The waitress told us a server called out an hour before her shift and then asked us to tell the manager, Doug, that the group of people were not there long (on at least 3 separate occasions!!) so they wouldn't get chewed out later.  Very unprofessional service.  ***On 6/20/17, Doug, the general manager, contacted me and was very apologetic about the whole situation. He expressed concern regarding the ice situation and how it's a non negotiable for any server to do that. He offered to make it up to us.  Doug was very professional and informed me that he would talk with the staff members about it. I feel confident that something like that would not happen again.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
34,Qui W.,"Chandler, AZ",32,54,67.0,3.0,2017-06-30,The Caesar salad is something fresh and wonderful. I loved it. The grilled shrimp was an awesome pairing as was the SANGRIA FLIGHT drinks. The only reason why this establishment isn't getting 5-stars is because we've dined-in the restaurant 3 times over the last 2 weeks and the service is consistently slow after being seated. 10-mins after being seated the waiter usually stops by and asks for your drink order. I've been able to place my food order and drink order at once during that time because I had already spent 10-mins reading the menu. I love the salad and drinks so much I will definitely be coming back but not on my lunch break or in a time crunch. PS --- the pizza crust and ingredients was awesome too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Great greet and we were seated right away.  Server and everyone was great.  Bread took awhile to get to us, but it was fresh when it finally arrived.  I had a pizza which was good, but a tad salty.  My girl had the Santa Fe bowl.  She really liked it.

Yep. Only ones waiting. It was very much not busy. Maybe a few words like "" The food will be out in 10 more minutes, etc would have helped. Went to pay for the soda we drank.

I don't know if you get a lot of to-go orders or a lot of catering in the afternoon instead of In-House patrons but we've eaten here many times since my last revealed and it's always been a 30 -40-minute plus, experience just for a sandwich and some soup.
