Pizza sounded... meh... but I was hungry and needed a bite. Ordered a regular cheese pizza (personal size) and a 20oz. bottle of coke, which racked up to $12.21. ACK! I could have ordered a REAL plate of food elsewhere. On the upside of the receipt, there is a ""coupon"" for 10% off the gelato place next door. Seating area was pretty small, very little room for single-person seating. Limited condiments for your pizza. I found a few packets of red peppers, but no parmesan cheese. Flavor was lacking, pizza was very bland. Sauce had very little flavor, crust could have been out of a box. The only reason they got 3 stars is because it's the fastest way to get food in an airport. Unforunately, that means that you don't know how long your food has been sitting there, just waiting for an unsuspecting victim to order...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

I hardly eat at chain restaurants at home, but it seems this trip was all of that.  Truth be told, I really came here, because it has a bar attached and they were playing the final playoff game before the World Series and being a Giants fan, that was my priority.  I had a seat facing the TV, ordered a nice local lager on tap and a Margarita pizza from CPK next door. My beer was fabulous and the pizza was pretty good. I liked how the dough bubbled up and was light and airy.  Even though my review should be about the bar next door, this is what I ate and it was definately a lot better than my last meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

14,Jim B.,"Buffalo, NY",95,313,608.0,3.0,2015-02-09,"I like to fly into Charlotte. It's a good hub that isn't dreadfully large and difficult to navigate. My only complaint is the food stands here; I've seemingly never had a good meal on a layover. In comes the California Pizza Kitchen... I'm not going to get you all giggly thinking I'm going to say the food impressed me. No sir, not by any stretch of the imagination. But there were some bright clearings in the sky. First of, the service behind the counter was very professional and fast. Secondly, in addition to the core pizza kitchen restaurant, this location boasted not only a standard airport ""quick lunch"" kiosk attached to it, but a bar named ""Taste of Carolina"" that you could order CPK food from. I mean, I wouldn't (Pizza from California? Don't be ridiculous). Having a bar in the bullpen is a super bonus when all of us miserable souls need to stuff ourselves in a plastic flying machine and chuck ourselves cross country at 30,000 feet. For me, it's a moot addition, considering I always keep a bottle of embalming fluid in my carry-on for sedation purposes so I can stomach the high cost and close proximity to the other miserable people (Relax. I only pack it in a clear container sized at 3 ounces or less). Note: DO NOT drink embalming fluid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza (Duh! Signature CPK!) and a small SmartWater and that set me back almost $18 - yikes.  Airport prices for ya. After a 10-15 minute wait, I finally got my pizza.  I took it with me to my gate so I could sit and eat in peace.  This was literally the worst pizza, let alone CPK, that I've ever had in my life.  The crust, or lack of crust, or bread, or whatever you want to call it, was reminiscent of stale flour tortilla with supermarket BBQ sauce and like a few pieces of chicken on top.  The best part of the pizza was probably the fresh basil they had on there.  I can't even begin to explain how hard it was to chew the pizza given it's strange, chewy texture.  I should have taken a cross-section of the pizza - it was literally as thin, or thinner, than a flour tortilla.  Maybe a half-cooked, 3 week old tortilla.
