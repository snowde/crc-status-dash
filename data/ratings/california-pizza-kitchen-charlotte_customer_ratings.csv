63,Eric D.,"Cornelius, NC",104,376,685.0,3.0,2012-02-23,"CPK, as some know it, is an upscale pizza chain.  Upscale from say a Pizza Hut but not too upscale, as you can dress casually.  At one time CPK was kind of special.  Now you can get their pizza anywhere from standalone locations, to airports (Chad E.) to your grocer's freezer section.  So, it was on this visit that I decide to NOT get the pizza. As typical for any place near South Park mall at lunch, the place was packed.  Fortunately, we were seated quickly and promptly waited on.  Upon pursuing the menu and not wanting pizza, I came across my selection...Carnitas Tacos.  The order arrived at the table as two flour tacos w/ not too spicy shredded pork in the middle of each taco.  Topping these tacos was salsa verde, shredded lettuce, cabbage, red onions, and cilantro.  The dish does come w/ avocado but I nixed that topping.  W/ a squeeze of lime, these tacos were pretty decent.  Great flavor and filling w/out leaving you stuffed.  The side of tortilla chips was the only part of the meal that tasted overly processed...like corn flavored Baked Lays.   All of this for $10.75 was a little pricey for two tacos and chips.  But then again, you are in SP and everything here is a little pricey. I recommend this dish as a great healthy alternative to a cheese laden pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

There wasn't even a manager that looked available we could complain to. You would think with the economic crises, people would want to hold on to their jobs -- but it amazes me the utter incompetency I see in the big chain service industry. From the minute we entered, two hostesses who have no clue, to a server who has no clue, to a chef who messes our order up, and actually not receiving our drinks until AFTER the food arrives, then waiting AGES to receive a bill.

Our waitress took our drink orders and I ordered a water with lemon as I always do. She brought our drinks about 5 minutes later and I noticed she did not bring the lemon. I asked politely if she could bring some lemon and she brought me one lemon slice on a plate....five minutes later.   I ordered some type of salad and specifically asked for no tomatoes on top. After waiting about 20 minutes for this tiny salad, it was delivered to my table with guess what, tomatoes on top! The waitress ran off before I had a chance to say anything. When she eventually returned to refill my water glass, I was picking the tomatoes out one-by-one. She managed to mumble ""sorry about the tomatoes"" before disappearing again.  Now, heaven forbid I was actually allergic to tomatoes! She made it very clear that she did NOT know how to listen. She did not offer to have the salad remade and I pretty much never saw her until she delivered the check.  I left unhappy and unsatisfied.

Being attached the South Park Mall, which I don't tend to enjoy....ever puts a damper on ever having to eat here.  I just don't like their menu. The pizzas are one size and barely serve as pizza in first place. The pies are all one size and lack in execution. The California Club, BBQ Chicken, Margherita, and Thai Chicken all sound good, but tend to be piled with too much and lack the done-ness I like. The only pizza I can really give honorable mention to is the Pear Gorgonzola. It's a nice combo and works rather well.  Worst part? Service. Shocking? Not really. It seems that they hire for ease rather than expertise. Multiple times I've experienced servers who were clueless or just straight up...not there. If you're in a hurry and need to get out quick, good luck. It's the biggest part of the business and also seems to be the part they pay the least amount of attention.  Up the service game, gents.

In the grand scheme of things, I wouldn't suggest that its pizza is the best or anything, but let's just say that I'm partial to a few things on the menu and that's what keeps me coming back. First off, I'm a big fan of the BBQ chicken chopped salad. I order it with extra avocado. That's usually my go-to. If I'm in a pizza mood it is usually something with chicken in it or possibly the carne asada. I'm not a huge fan of their appetizers, generally. I like that you can request honey wheat dough. The service here isn't that great. And the wait times can be outrageous. I've had a couple of really bad experiences with wait times here and can honestly say that you should not come here if you're in a hurry.

22,Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,3.0,2013-07-29,"In general I really enjoy CPK. This visit the only thing I didn't enjoy was that the place has two entrances and the hostess had some difficulty determining who came in first (even though we were very polite when telling her that we had come in ahead of another group) they were on her list first so they got seated first. If a place has two entrances and they are getting busy, its a good idea to establish a line and stick to it. The only reason we were there was because our first choice restaurant had a 2.5 hour wait and CPK only had a 30 min wait. Anyways, once we were seated everything was good. Our server Elisabeth was great. We had the Focaccia bread and the Fried Macaroni small plate as our appetizers. The bread was good and the mac was ok. The breading on the mac was delicious the mac in itself was a bit lacking in flavor. We had three pizzas at our table - The Meat Cravers on orig crust, Jamaica Jerk Chicken thin crust, and Hawaiian BBQ. The Jamaican Jerk was spicy but very tasty! All three were really good. The flavored lemonades and teas were good. All in all, we had a good experience. Standard CPK from what we've experienced. Good food and good service and reasonably priced.

58,Drew M.,"Charlotte, NC",6,34,,1.0,2013-11-04,"Normally, this restaurant has a great reputation.  In Florida, it was one of my favorite places.  Here in the Southpark location in Charlotte, it is actually really bad. The last few times I went, the service was terrible, the hostesses rude, the food was bland and skimpy on portions, and the atmosphere awful.   The very last time I went, it was so bad, that I emailed the corporate office to let them know they are being represented poorly here in charlotte, and they sent me a couple of free meal coupons. So, this past weekend, I went there to give them one last try. Upon arrival, I noticed quite a few tables out on their patio, and the day was glorious...74 and totally sunny.  Once inside at the hostess stand, I requested a table on the patio.  She told me they had ""stopped seating outside"", and it was 1:00pm??  I then said, well I guess we have to sit inside, which she then told me there was a 15-20 minute wait.  When I questioned all of this (since there were no people waiting, and the dining room was practically empty, she said they were short-staffed.   Wow!  Talk about your horrible management!  This is so sad.  I hate to see a good company go down because of horrible management.  Needless to say, I did not stay to eat, and will never return to this location again.  I do wish there was another Charlotte location in the Ballantyne area that had a different manager so they could be as wonderful as they are in other states.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.148,2.64

If you can battle the parking lot that was clearly designed by Helen Keller, CPK seems like a reasonable mall choice.  Back by Urban Outfitters and The Container Store, I would park elsewhere and walk through the mall.  Since it is located right next to the food court, parking is awful.  Even at 11:15, folks were starting the Battle Royale for parking spots (and the spots are narrow - my 4runner was taking up the entire spot - I would not park there again).   My lunch dates were already seated when I got there and the friendly hostess showed me to them - on a Friday at 11:15 there was a light crowd, but folks were starting to roll in as we were leaving.   I quickly ordered a diet Coke and since I had checked out the menu online beforehand, I knew I wanted to try the Caramelized Peach Salad which contained field greens and spinach (all tender greens, no tough or bitter), warm peaches, dried cranberries, gorgonzola cheese and toasted pecans with a white vinaigrette (I had them leave off the red onions).  Their salads can be ordered in 1/2 portions, which is what I got ($8), and it was more than enough for a light lunch.  You can add bacon, chicken, etc for an upcharge.  Everything blended well, it wasn't over-dressed, though the vinegar was pretty stout and I would not have been angry about having a few more pecans.  Nice portion with fresh ingredients, it was just right.   Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  He managed us and a few other tables (one was a large party of clucking females) with ease.  Little one's cheese pizza looked pretty darn good, so I will probably return again (*after* the holidays) to check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.348,2.72

The head chef came out and explained all procedures in making their GF pizza to assure me that there would be no cross contamination and the manager brought my food out, explaining that he had washed his hands and not gone near gluten before serving my food.  I was extremely impressed with their customer service and dedication to providing a safe place to eat for those of us with Celiacs and gluten intolerance, unlike The Cheesecake Factory which has a GF menu but makes all the pasta in the same water, GF and regular, which defeats the purpose of a GF menu for Celiacs.   But back to the pizza!  It was the most normal tasting GF pizza I've had, it was actually doughy and wasn't brittle or super thin.  Even Tim said he couldn't tell it was GF.  I'm definitely coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.58,2.84

As much as I love this place, I wish they would just come back with their Peking Duck Pizza they used to have!! This location in particular, I sat outside for lunch and thought the patio was pretty spacious for shopping mall. The view was also nicer than some of the other ones I have been to and you are staring at a parking lot. The waiter I had was very fast and friendly as well, definitely a place I would stop at if I had to get food and be in and out.  I ordered the small plate wedges salad as well as the hawaiian pizza while I was there. The small wedge salad was pretty good, I mean you can't really mess up a salad so I can't complain. The thing I love about the CPK pizzas is the crust, it is not flavorless and always really sweet. Kind of like a Kings Hawaiian roll on a pizza, which is why I make a point to order the pizza everytime I am there. When I ordered this pizza at this location, the crust did not taste like it was supposed to and I was disapointed!! My favorite part is the crust and I did not eat any of it on this visit.

However, the spinach artichoke dip was room temperature instead of hot. After flagging down the waiter (since he never checked in on us) he quickly got it heated. Then the main course of barbecue chicken pizza came. It tasted quite great.  While talking with my company, the waiter came, and instead of refilling my drink that had been empty for quite some time, he took my lat piece of pizza and the spinach artichoke dip away without asking if I was finished or if I wanted a box! (Which I did as I was still eating the pizza and planned on boxing the dip).  He then finally refilled my drink- halfway. That was the cherry on top-- after the whole mess of a night he only refilled my drink half way even though he had an entire pitcher at his disposal.

Once I made my selection on the prompt a girl picks up the phone and says, ""hello""....hello? I'm not calling your personal phone! How about your name and where I'm calling? Duh! Then she couldn't tell me anything about delivery, said she should though and then transferred me to the guy who would. He was equally underwhelming. I asked if they delivered and he said yes but his delivery guy is out. That was it. So I inquired further...out delivering or out for the night and then he says out for the night. Jesus what is wrong with the youth nowadays. Most seem to have no work ethic and seriously lack common sense and customer service.

We were told the wait at the pizza kitchen was only 20 minutes and decided to add our name to the list. We came back 20 minutes later and were told it would be an additional 20 minutes because the current table they picked for us was still seated. Not a problem, we browsed another store and came back to be told the table was STILL occupied. We decided to have a seat and since the small waiting area was full, the hostess told us if we sat right outside they would come call us when it was ready.  After waiting a full hour from our original check in, we went back for the 4th time and the hostess told us our name was called, and when no one claimed the table they sat another party. We immediately asked why no one ever came to call us in the seating area and they simply said we usually recommend someone waits inside the restaurant. No apology, no further accommodations.  Needless to say we left and waited for the buzzer from maggianos to go off and had a MUCH more enjoyable experience.

As someone who tries to make health conscious choices when ordering from the menu yet always finds the selections unappealing, CPK's menu is like a breath of fresh air!!! The Pizza selections are great and the food is always excellent!  The staff is always extremely pleasant, probably due to the amazing leadership of management. Nina is simply AWESOME! Always fun and engaging, Nina is exceedingly personable and always makes sure you feel valued and important!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

31,Nini K.,"Charlotte, NC",3,9,13.0,1.0,2017-08-12,when my friends and I decide to go somewhere to eat I almost always bring up  California pizza at southpark mall but they always shut my suggestion down but as of yesterday I agree with them and now I can see why I went in to get pizza for take out they gave me pizza dough and all the toppings  on a side in little containers do i guess I had to bake the pizza myself I told them I wanted it put together not deconstructed  and tostada pizza with beans and tortilla strips lemon chicken instead of ranch they put mayonnaise on top it was disgusting I think it was done because I complained that pizza was not put together at first .never going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
2,Brantly W.,"Charlotte, NC",1,32,13.0,1.0,2017-08-20,"When you eat here, expect to feel as if you a bother to the employees. My friend and I ate here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and sadly I believe it will be my last visit. The host area is unorganized and unattended. After another employee got the host a few ppl ahead of got seated and then we did. Upon being seated it took several minutes for the waitress to show up. (& it was not slammed, so being busy isn't an excuse) Her demeanor and attitude was very unfriendly. Her service was poor. Meaning the amount of time it took to get our good and drinks, never once got a refill, and taking awhile to process our checks.  The only ounce of friendliness was when she dripped the checks off BC she was thinking about us tipping.  She acted like she hated being there.  And the the same attitude with the food runner.  The food itself was ok. I got the chicken wrap app as a meal and my friend got a salad. But in my opinion it's over priced for mediocre food and bad service. Do yourself a favor, save time and money and go to the food court instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
10,Amy R.,"Richmond, VA",0,21,4.0,2.0,2017-09-05,"I have a soft spot for the chicken Waldorf salad, but have had two frustrating experiences at this location with the same waiter. I felt like he was constantly trying to upsell us. When we asked for water, he was like ohh bottled water right? And when we ordered our food he started rattling off a bunch of appetizers saying you want one? He did this as he was leaving so we were constantly saying no no. Just the things we asked for. Don't add extra stuff onto our bill. Then when it was time for the check, he was nowhere to be found until he rolled up saying ""you want dessert, right?"" I realize they want you to spend more money at their establishment, but it felt like he was trying to trick us into paying for things we didn't ask for. I've had this server twice and both times it was the same experience. I haven't been back since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
1,Nick P.,"Richmond, VA",0,18,,1.0,2017-10-07,Totally burned and someone thought this was acceptable to deliver to their customers.  Ridiculous that I paid over $50 for burned pizzas.

6,Ronee J.,"Charlotte, NC",0,17,2.0,1.0,2017-11-24,Black Friday ...we were looking for a great dinner by ordering takeout...ordered 2 pizzas and a large Thai Salad.  One of the pizzas was basically raw...uncooked crust and raw veggies. The pizzas weren't even warm. The salad tasted like the chicken was several days old. Everything was just horrible!  Very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
4,Trevor H.,"Durham, NC",183,31,44.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"I have been to this location twice in 2017 and I have had pleasant experiences each of the times I've eaten here.  Both times the waiter/waitresses were friendly, and for the most part attentive. Something that stood out to me and left a good impression was that I was greeted by both managers, and one of them specifically made sure I was satisfied with my experience.  All the staff that greeted me had a smile and pleasant demeanor.  The restaurant was clean including the bathroom.  Both times at this location, I have ordered the Carne Asada and was pleased that they have an option to have a wheat crust.  The pizza came out in a timely manner and was delicious.  The steak on the pizza was very tender​ and full of flavor.  The Carne Asada is my favorite pizza at CPK and I highly recommend​ it to all you carnivores reading this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
3,B. R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,,5.0,2018-01-06,California Pizza has great food and wonderful service. We had pizza and a pasta dish prepared to the best of consideration.  The service was probably the best of any restaurant.  Our server kept the glasses full and anticipated our every need.

0,Jordan S.,"North Charleston, SC",123,7,3.0,5.0,2018-01-10,"Even though lots of these reviews seem negative, I had a pleasant experience back in November when I visited.  The restaurant was completely crowded, so my party of 5 sat at the bar. Our server took a little while at first, but he was obviously very busy with bartending and such. I ordered the Berry Sangria and it was delish, one of the best sangrias I have had. For dinner, I tried their new Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti pasta, and it was just phenomenal. I am a huge mushroom fan and the past was cooked very well. While our meal was being served, the manager came over and spoke to us. She was very knowledgeable and displayed great customer service. We ended the meal with the Butter Cake and the Chocolate Souffle Cake. Both were very tasty.  I look forward to returning tomorrow afternoon for my next business trip to Charlotte!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
