I know CPK gets a bad rap for being crazily unhealthy, but sometimes you just want a cheesy, oily pizza. Or pasta. Or appetizer. Maybe it's something about Saturday nights. Because that's when we came; a Saturday night after a long day of running errands. Tons of people in line, but because there were just two of us, we managed to grab some of the first-come-first-serve sitting room at the bar. CPK had a full house that night, so it took a while for our server, who was also the bartender, to get to us that night, but it was pretty understandable. You know, up until this visit, I didn't realize that this was a ""thing"" people did: Stand at the bar without grabbing a seat and order drinks. Just a standing bar! No seat required! Maybe I'll try it sometime. But I digress. While service was understandably slow, the bartender/server was extremely friendly and helpful. The drinks were good, the bar area was clean, and, most importantly for our hungry bellies, the food came very quickly! It's CPK, so prices are standard, but it seemed like a decent value to me.

129,Dana M.,"Pittsburgh, United States",38,120,17.0,1.0,2012-04-07,"My husband and I went on the fourth of July, so you can imagine it was very dead in there. He ordered a mac and cheese appetizer, I ordered the lettuce wraps, and we ordered our entrees. The server was extremely friendly and made conversation with us, making us very comfortable. Then it all went down hill from there. My lettuce wraps came out but my husband's appetizer didn't. We figured it took a little longer and didn't think anything of it at first. We waited 10 minutes. My husband began to get a little annoyed because he was starving and asked the server about his mac and cheese appetizer and she quickly went to the back to find out what happened to it. She returned within a few minutes to tell us that it should be out in a few minutes. We waited another 15 minutes before she returned with our entrees and an apology about the appetizer. She offered to take the mac and cheese off the bill but my husband declined the order and just enjoyed his pizza, which was Hawaiian BBQ but more bbq than anything else. My Waldorf salad was also soaking in dressing. Huge no no. Anyway, about ten minutes after we got our entrees someone who seemed to be the manager came over to apologize again and told us that she had taken both appetizers off the bill and we could get a free dessert. Great effort on their part but still super annoyed.  I feel really bad for the server bc I imagine it wasn't her fault, but this place really needs to step it up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.404,3.1600000000000006

57,Cookie R.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",60,25,5.0,4.0,2013-04-24,"An under-utilized dining option at the Macy's wing of the Cherry Hill Mall, California Pizza Kitchen has a menu that delivers on its promise. Take a look at the menu, there's plenty more than pizza. I've been sampling my way around that menu lately, and I've yet to find an item I wasn't pleased with. So far of the pizzas, my favorite is the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach. While these are pizzas it would be nice to share, I embarassingly polished mine off in one sitting. Making happy food noises while I did it too. I dig the lettuce wraps, similar to the ones at PFChangs/Pei Wei. The split pea and barley soup is good. There's flavorful fish tacos.  The new addition section of the menu had a salad that featured quinoa that was good, though the little bits of asparagus in it were a texture disconnect as it was too raw a feeling, when asked what I'd like to add, I learned salmon was an option. It was outstanding. When you dine take-out with them, they are generous with the utensils. When you dine in the restaurant, there's a wonderful selection of drinks. The strawberry pina colada was too good.  The staff is very accommodating and on a recent visit was happy to help our large party out of the who-has-cash-and-who-brought-credit-cards jam by issuing separate checks. The ambiance is good, the music great without being distracting. Full disclosure, this CPK partnered with my store in our Earth Month fundraising with a dining out event. I'm sharing this not just so you know I'm interested in them doing well, but because I would encourage anyone who is looking to do a fundraising event to work with them.  If there's anything I'd have be different it pertains, as usual, to my own selfishness. I'd have them stay open a little later like some of the other restaurants at the Cherry Hill Mall.

114,Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, United States",276,476,329.0,2.0,2014-01-08,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) recently donated food to a local animal rescue event I attended. After trying a sample of their chicken cesar  sandwich, I knew I needed to go and have the full thing.  So on a late Sunday afternoon I battled the parking at the Cherry Hill Mall and made my way to CPK. I was warmly greeted and seated right away in the empty restaurant. It wasn't until a few minutes in that I realized there was outdoor seating- the hostess never offered this.  I didn't even have to look at the menu- as I knew what I was getting. I decided to get an appetizer because I had a free small plate coupon- I went with the mushroom and spinach flat bread- it was delicious and came with 4 reasonably sized pieces. Normally its about $5.  I was happy to see that the chicken cesar salad sandwich came with a side salad that comes out with the dish. The sandwich was as great as I remembered- all of it was delicious. That was until I bit into a cold piece of chicken- very gross.  I expected better service since it was a slow Sunday afternoon. The waitress didn't pay much attention to us, because instead the wait staff was busy socializing. When it came time to pay the bill- the waitress brought over the check.

33,Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",276,476,329.0,2.0,2014-08-01,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) recently donated food to a local animal rescue event I attended. After trying a sample of their chicken cesar  sandwich, I knew I needed to go and have the full thing.  So on a late Sunday afternoon I battled the parking at the Cherry Hill Mall and made my way to CPK. I was warmly greeted and seated right away in the empty restaurant. It wasn't until a few minutes in that I realized there was outdoor seating- the hostess never offered this.  I didn't even have to look at the menu- as I knew what I was getting. I decided to get an appetizer because I had a free small plate coupon- I went with the mushroom and spinach flat bread- it was delicious and came with 4 reasonably sized pieces. Normally its about $5.  I was happy to see that the chicken cesar salad sandwich came with a side salad that comes out with the dish. The sandwich was as great as I remembered- all of it was delicious. That was until I bit into a cold piece of chicken- very gross.  I expected better service since it was a slow Sunday afternoon. The waitress didn't pay much attention to us, because instead the wait staff was busy socializing. When it came time to pay the bill- the waitress brought over the check. I put my credit card in and waited 15 minutes. Finally after realizing the waitress was too caught up in hanging out I switched my payment to cash and left. I'm not sure the waitress even knew I left. This could be a great place- they have an awesome menu, tons of drinks, a great customer rewards app, and a very cool trendy atmosphere- but they need to pay more attention to detail and their customers.

I have been mostly going to blaze pizza once opened up nearby and since I have not been there for a few years i said this will be a good time to check it out on my way back from Washington DC trip and a pit stop in Cherry Hill. Wow all I will say they will need to change business model soon as Blaze pizza will hands down destroy them when it comes to coal fired pizza. We ordered a plain pie  for the kids to split and when it was ordered I just said 1 kids pizza to split as kids were not that hungry. We also ordered 2 salads to keep it light, 1 half size w chicken 15$ and full size arugula and Quinoa with Salmon 19$. I also ordered Moscow mule 10$. The salads below average very plain not tasty you would expect a lot more for the price paid. Honesty I had better almost any place I can think of. The drink way too sweet the worst Moscow mule I had. All I tasted was lime juice and no alcohol. Now to the pizza, it looked like a good size kids pizza with way too much crust , it turned out this was a regular size pizza that was 11.99!! Wow.. the waitress ended  up changing it it to 5.99 but kind of put it on me that I didn't explain?? What is there to explain I ordered plain pizza to split for my 4 year old kids to split from the children's menu? The kids pizza is super small as I have peeked and seen from another family nearby! We are used to paying 5$ for super nice Blaze pizza much tastier with no huge crust which we all know kids don't like. Service overall below mediocre Waitress disappeared for 10+ minutes and had to ask around for out waitress as we had to leave.
