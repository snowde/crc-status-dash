29,Maria L.,"Ballwin, MO",2,12,,2.0,2012-01-19,"It was my daughter's 20th birthday and she chose to go to CPK for dinner.  There was a total of 5 of us and we ordered spinich artichoke dip to start.  It was just ok, I had better.  We then order the tostada pizza and the meat pizza can't remember the exact name.  They were good but not for the outrageous price.  Lastly the birthday girl order the bar-b-q salad and that was good.  Service was just ok, I had to ask to get my water refilled. Lastly I reviewed the bill and then submitted my credit card.  When I was adding the tip, I noticed that I was only charged for half the cost compared to what I reviewed.  I could have let this go and they would have been shorted but that's not how I roll.  Instead I waved down our waitress who then called the manager over to the register to help her fix it.  Ten minutes later she brings back the correct bill.  Now you would think that the manager would have came by and said thank you for bringing this to our attention but he didn't even acknowledge that I saved him $30!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
25,Doug M.,"Chesterfield, MO",57,321,834.0,3.0,2012-02-26,"I hadn't been to California Pizza Kitchen for a long time.  When I have gone, I've only gotten the pizza.  It's okay, but I generally prefer other pizza parlor pizzas.  So on Friday, Feb. 24 my wife and I decided to try CPK again.  This was only because it was 7 pm, and all the places we preferred had crazy full parking lot Our drink choices are non-alcoholic, decaf, and sugar-free - which often means water.  But since we do enjoy drinking something that actually adds to the meal, we will order sparkling water if they have it.  CPK had San Pellegrino listed on the menu, and what was very nice (and unusual!) was that they included not just its price, but prices for both a 500 mL bottle and for a 1L bottle.  $3.50 and $4.50.  Well, the $4.50 bottle was obviously a much better deal, and is how much two people would drink, so we order that.  Kudos to CPK! They now have a small plates menu in addition to the regular menu.  I like small plates, but even though I'm not a big guy it takes eight to ten items to fill me up.  That gets pricy.  CPK's choices, though, looked like good options for individual appetizers.  My wife got white corn guacamole & chips for $4.50, and I ordered a cheese bread with rosemary oil for dipping plate for $2.50  They were well sized for individual appetizers, and appropriate for the prices.  Flavor and presentation were good for both.  However, one of my bread pieces had some nylon bristles baked into the cheese topping - which I discovered when I bit into it.  Must have been from a basting brush.  I pulled them off and finished eating the food, since it wasn't something that indicated uncleanliness to me.  I notified our waitress as soon as she came by (to bring our entrees), and she apologized & immediately had the manager remove the item from my bill.  Since the manager was right there, and we were close to an ordering station, it only took about 30 seconds. Speaking of the bill, it seemed odd to me that the bill was delivered at the same time as the entrees.  It was just a register receipt, and placed face down, but normally that happens after the entree.  Not a complaint, just a bit quirky. I went non-pizza this time, and got the jambalaya.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Lots of meat & seafood with linguini noodles, and enough heat in the flavorful spices to tingle my lips.  One thing about jambalaya - I always wish the shrimp tails would get cut off.  Why do I have to do this myself? My wife ordered their Margherita pizza, one of the thin crust items.  I didn't taste it until the next day's leftovers, but it was pretty good.  Nice strong tomato flavor, with a crispy but not crunchy crust. We had forgotten that the place is pretty popular with families.  That's not a bad thing, but it can make for some unpleasant situations.  Seated behind my wife were two tables with small children.  They did not make a sound the entire time, and either crew with crayons or simply talked quietly.  But seated behind me was a family with three small boys.  They laughed and joked, a bit loudly, but not too bad.  Then the conversation got a bit rude.  First one boy asked his dad if he had ever farted into a trumpet, and dad enjoyed playing along with the gag about the sound it would make.  Then the conversation turned to poop - and the mom got in on the whole thing.  Dad also brought up Mr. Hankie, and at this point I turned around and said, ""We don't need to hear this"" - with a smile and laugh.  So the point was made, but the mood wasn't ruined for either of us.  Oh, well - that's the hazards of eating out. Overall, I'll give the place an all right.  It was good, but I just can bring it to a 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
21,Russ B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",12,66,,4.0,2012-05-21,i love the food at CPK! I also like how they are encouraging people to try new things and if you don't like it they will make you whatever you want.  Most restaurants will do this also but they don't broadcast it.   No drink specials or happy hours ever according to the waitress which I thought was weird.   Over all great food.  Get the habanero pizza!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield?start=20,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
27,Steve M.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,23,,1.0,2013-03-19,"We had never been to a California Pizza Kitchen before and we were looking forward to trying it.  My wife and I arrived there Tuesday (3-19-13) at 12:05 pm.  We walked right in and were immediately told there would be a 10-15 minute wait.  There was absolutely nobody waiting in front of us and there were several visibly empty tables.  I asked why the wait?  I was told ""the wait staff can only handle 4-5 tables at a time per person"".  Huh?  We departed.  No ""sorry"" or anything from the host/hostess.  They just lost $30-$40 of our money.  Is that how a business makes money?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield?start=20,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

10,Maggie H.,"Saint Louis, MO",72,442,98.0,3.0,2014-08-01,"I've been to three different California Pizza Kitchens. I can't see what all the fuss is about. The last two times I've gone, I haven't been in the mood to eat, so perhaps this review will be unfair in its assessment of CPK. My most recent visit was to the Chesterfield location. I believe Chesterfield Mall is at an unhealthy place. Perhaps it has started its slow death. CPK was slow when I arrived, but it was busy by the time I left. I wasn't expecting a lot of ambiance at this chain restaurant, and I didn't get it, either.   Not being in an eating mood, I selected the least offensive item: fettuccine alfredo, which I usually dislike. I'm not into alfredo sauce. I took a few bites, made excuses as to my appetite, and took the rest home. I gave my leftovers to someone else, who said it was the best fettuccine alfredo she'd ever had, so perhaps there is merit in the positive reviews of others.   They had me sign up for the free rewards program, which is great if you like the restaurant, I guess, but all of these programs offered by restaurants and stores just fill my inbox with requests to visit so many places I neither the time nor the money to visit. It's handy with a few, but a free small plate with the purchase of something else, which is, I believe, what this ""reward"" was for, was not quite appealing enough to get me to show up to CPK again before the too-prompt expiration date, which has already passed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield,,,,,
23,Mike O.,"St Peters, MO",36,53,2.0,3.0,2014-08-16,"Generally pretty good.  tad pricey but that's what you expect when you go there.  Not a terrible value, just a tad pricey.   Here's my complaint.  Needs more attention to cleanliness.  Standards are low.  We ate before noon on a Saturday, when they were slow so no excuse for seating us at a dirty table.  had to ask two people to get the table wiped down.  Then they brought out some bread and small plates.  One of those plates was disgustingly dirty with visible food on it.  Sent  the plate back with the waiter.  The later when our pizza came, we used the small plates they leave on the table.  One of those was nasty dirty too. We were in a booth and the wooden wall next to us was also in need of a good wipe down.   So all in all, it's ok but need to pay more attention to cleaning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield?start=20,,,,,

You know those gas station bathrooms, in the middle of nowhere, that only have an entrance on the outside of the building, where you have to go inside to get the key (usually attached to a piece of wood)?

13,Garfield G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,124,4.0,2.0,2015-01-21,"So I work for a Global Fortune 100 company.   A company revenues around $70 Billion a year.   And guess where the cheap ass Vice President's (not my VP) admin decides to send the group (and she is not in attendance by the way).   Yep...you guessed it!    Good 'ol CPK!.  I was an invited guest so I can't really bitch I guess as I didn't have to go.   I just happen to run the building that they were holding their training today.   So I figured, what the heck, I haven't seen some of these people in awhile and I like a few of them so I'll tag along.    I think this is the 2nd or 3rd time I've eaten at one of these.    So first off, when I think of pizza, I do not think of California.  And a real good way to prove that is when you think of California one does not think of pizza.   I'm pretty sure when you think of pizza you think of NY, Chicago, Italy, or basically anywhere in the Northeast...including Mystic Pizza  (ha, ha).  The restroom needed some work.   The plates that they gave us were probably 25% dirty.    The appetizers were absolutely disgusting.  I have no idea what the hell I even ate.   They serve beer in a can!!   Really?   Beer in a can, yes that is what I said.   Some may like that due to the novelty or some may like it cause they think they are cool or funny drinking a beer in a can, but 'cmon.   No one really likes canned beer.   I don't care what you say.  If you had a choice, you would drink from the tap or in a bottle....not canned.   Shut up..no you wouldn't either.   Not if you had a choice.  I had the Jamaican Jerk Pizza and I tried the BBQ Chicken pizza.   Ok, there is an old adage that putting bacon on something makes it better.   Yeah, well not on a California Pizza Kitchen Pizza.   Both these pizza's had bacon on it.  Of course, the bacon was amazing....I ate that.   But I could barely eat the far too ridiculously spiced Jamaican Jerk.   Just cause it has ""jerk"" in it, doesn't mean you can drench it in spices to hide the actual flavor of the meat.   Jimminy Crickets!  I will say the crust was ok.   My iced tea was watered to all hell.   It'll be too soon if I go back to another CPK in 10 years. oh ps.  the blonde manager of this CPK is smoking hot.....that was literally the only benefit of tonight.   My God was she hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield,,,,,

We arrived to celebrate my nieces birthday and they were able to sit our big party pretty quickly, which is a positive in my book.  However they only assigned one waiter to our group of 10+ which slowed things down tremendously. I had signed up for CPK rewards on suggestion from a friend.  The item you get for signing up is not on this menu and I was unable to redeem the reward.  Our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable but I ordered a half Caesar salad (which could have been a whole salad) and shared a pizza with another member of our group.  Both arrived timely however my soda was only refilled 2x in my visit, which was very disappointing.

7,Mark E.,"Chesterfield, MO",193,34,6.0,3.0,2016-05-02,"I've been a fan of this chain for years, long before they opened up in Chesterfield some years ago. Went there over the weekend with a group of 6, and it just didn't feel like the same place. What we ate was good overall, but things see to change every time I go to CPK, and not always for the better. They have tried to update their menu by adding main courses and more depth to it and moving their trimmed down pizza selection to a small flap on the side of the menu. Less variety and a less than prominent position for pizzas at a place formerly known for their pizzas. Curious.  Service can be spotty at this location, and while our server tried his best, things like having only one bartender, and a new one at that, made for long delays in getting some drinks. Portions seem to be getting just a tiny bit smaller every time I go there, except for the pizza. They may be making up for the fact they haven't made the pizzas smaller by skimping a bit on the toppings.  All in all, a decent meal. Not the great experience it was five years ago or even a year ago, but it was acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chesterfield,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
4,Caprice F.,"Saint Louis, MO",115,426,1314.0,3.0,2016-07-20,"Whenever at a mall, and in the mood for a sit-down restaurant with decent pizza, CPK always serves as a good option. I admit I haven't been to any CPK in a good couple years, and haven't been to this location longer than that. It didn't feel like the same place that it once was to me. My waiter was good and friendly, but the pizza took a long time to arrive despite the fact that it was lunchtime on a Monday and the restaurant was not full at all. I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza which has always been one of my favorites here. I felt like it had far less cheese on it than I remember. The restaurant used to have parmesan cheese at the table, now no longer. You have to ask for it and it's done by hand by the waiter. I can't complain about fresh parmesan but because my pizza seemed to be lacking cheese, I probably gave him carpel tunnel. This place has never been cheap per say, but I was shocked to see how expensive the pizzas are now. Every pizza was about $14-$15. I could swear that they used to be about $11-$12. The dough and bread are still the same and good. But I don't feel like the quality of my pizza was worth the price, even though it was enough to take some home.

I had to stop him for everything and he walked past me several times not asking was everything ok...even after he dropped off my food. So i didnt really appreciate that. The good thing is when i asked him for something he got it, but still was expecting better service due to the lack of patrons. CPK has some really good dipping oil.
