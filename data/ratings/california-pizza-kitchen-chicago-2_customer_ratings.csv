We tried their pizza and it was delicious for a this crust, also had appetizers and salad. The place wasnt loud, so its good for meeting friends or another couple. Casual and relaxed atmosphere, would probably go here for a light snack or light dinner.

47,Tina H.,"Chicago, IL",19,34,4.0,3.0,2012-03-16,"I like CPK. I always get the Spinach Artichoke Dip and the Wardorf Salad. As for the pizza, back in the hay days, when they had the Carne Asada pizza, I always got that.  But now, I always change my mind and get whatever meets my fancy for the evening. Sucks that they got rid of the Carne Asada.  I remember CPK providing bread and butter - but they stopped doing that? Sarah (our waitress) didn't bring us any. To be fair, we didn't ask for any either. But still, in hindsight, I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't give me free bread....I like free stuff. =) For the first time last night, I tried the Jambalaya pasta. Very salty. I like the ingredients in it (chicken, crawfish, shrimp, veggies, etc.). But I hate the fact that they confuse salty with spicy. Folks, just because something is salty doesn't mean it's spicy! CPK is a decent joint. But I just can't get myself to give it more than three-stars. The service is ""meh"" and the food is decent. In Chicago, there are tons of other GREAT places you can visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=80,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.1160000000000005,2.96

I like the salad selecton and will be back to try more. I feel like I got what I paid for and the food was very delicious. I am always looking for quick, healthy take out and this place delivers that. Their staff was also really friendly. So they are a lot more than just pizza... who knew... I didn't.

106,R R.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,1.0,2013-06-07,Ate here a few days ago. I would not go back. I ordered a virgin strawberry daquiri. This was the first time that I've tried a daquiri that tasted more lemon-like than strawberry-like. Also it was a pale pink color rather than the deep pink color I'm used to seeing in my strawberry daquiris. I figured I'd go with the Kung Pao spaghetti substituting the spaghetti for multigrain penne. I also had chicken. The chicken amount was measly. It hardly felt substantial at all. I couldn't really taste the flavor of the sauce. I had to douse it in hot sauce to give it any flavor and the kind of hot sauce they had was a Mexican brand which again did nothing for me. Have had much better food elsewhere. The server though was very nice and attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=120,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.204,2.96

Have you ever heard of a Hawaiian pizza? Or a pizza with pineapple, coconut or other types of fruit? Well, you can have it at this establishment. The pizzas are made to order. So, we ordered one barbeque chicken pizza and one pizza with pineapple and other fruits. We shared them, and they were both delicious! The restaurant also serves sandwiches and pasta.

It was within walking distance from our hotel and having Mitch as our waiter were the two pluses.  We ordered the hummus for an appetizer which was so yummy and creamy. I feel like you can't go wrong ordering some hummus to wet your appetite for more. Next we split the Thai Crunch salad....oh my goodness, the portion size was HUGE and it was the best. fresh avocado, thai peanut dressing, rice noodles and so much more.

Sometimes deciding where to grab something delicious without having to wait an hour or so, in Chicago on a Friday night, can be an overwhelming task. CPK took care of that for me last night!  Appetizer - I went for the fried mac n'cheese. I wanted something tasty without it being too heavy on the stomach. They were perfectly fried in panko bread crumbs and very reasonably priced. Drinks - My friend and I tried quite a few of them! The Appleberry Sangria was great. The Platinum Margarita, which is a new menu item of theirs, was even better and you can choose an additional floater on top of it, either Grand Marnier or Chambord; we had a number of those. Try it!!!!! Dinner - Can we say filling?!?! I had the Pesto Cream Penne with chicken and shrimp. I wish I could put pesto on everything. I could only get through half of my dish, which was the same story for my friend who had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Mine was definitely better though! Dessert - Oh desert lords..... you are amazing. GET THE BUTTER CAKE A LA MODE! It must have the dust of angels baked into it. It must have happiness sprinkled on the top. The cake batter must have pieces of clouds as its base. It was BEYOND delicious and no matter how much I tried to stop eating it, I couldnt.

My first two visits came back in November when the lines at nearby Shake Shack were extremely long. Being heavily pregnant then, I was not going to torture myself in the cold so I opted to dine here. Service was good both times and both times I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti.  It was a dish I ordered in the past and they still make it as good as I remembered. Earlier this month, I received a gift card for CPK and used it to get take-out. Their take-out process is very simple with a dedicated line (press #1 after dialing their number) and I was able to place my order easily. My only gripe was there was a lot of upselling on the phone- asking me to join some program, asking me if I want breadsticks or desserts, telling me about their new specials, etc. While I understand it's their job to upsell, as a new mother who is lacking in sleep and craving carbs, I just want my order placed ASAP. Rawr (this is my attempt at roaring).  Pick-up at CPK was very easy and, as usual, the staff was very nice. I'm definitely a fan of this place but should limit my visits as $17 for a bowl of spaghetti will quickly leave me broke.

29,Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,623,715.0,5.0,2015-03-30,"We were here a few weeks ago as a family. It was a Saturday evening and it was not crowded. The weather was pretty cold, so it was not surprising people stayed in. Located in the heart of River North, California Pizza Kitchen is very convenient. As a person with a milk allergy, you might wonder why I would go to a pizzeria. Frankly, and so there is full disclosure, my daughter recently got a job here. But, my review is not based on her being there, but on the experience and the food. They have many options for people who can't or don't do milk products. First of all, they have a nice drink menu. I shared a cocktail with my daughter - don't recall exactly what it was called, but it was berry flavored, fizzy and tasty. I also had their version of split pea soup. I believe this was vegan and it was great. The only downside was the portion was so large, I had trouble eating my whole meal after that. We also got an order of their egg roll sampler. They had three different varieties. While I didn't have any of them, I was told they were excellent. For my meal, yes, I ordered a pizza without cheese. I've done this before in various restaurants and have always been disappointed. I had one of their hand tossed pizzas. Figuring it had to have a lot to account for the lack of cheese, I ordered their version of the works. First of all, the crust was outstanding. Although I live in Chicago, I grew up outside of New York and miss the style of crust from the East. This was very similar - doughy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The toppings were plentiful and fresh. If I had not had a bowl of soup before it came, I'm certain I would have finished it. But, I was only able to eat 1/2 of it and took the rest home. I do go to River North quite a lot although I find the restaurants there tend to be tourist traps. Having been to other California Pizza Kitchens over the years, I would classify this as consistent with the others and not too touristy. But, all in all, I was very happy with the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=20,4.12,3.47,3.47,3.4120000000000004,3.7300000000000004

Called to find out what their parking situation is, a young lady on the phone said they validate next door's garage. I asked if that made it free, she said yes but sounded uncertain. We decided to make it a go since they seemed to offer a solution to the parking issue. We get in, ask the hostess (seemed to be the same girl who answered the phone) if we could validate, she said at the end of the meal and it validates for 3 hours, she sounded iffy when she said it would be free again.  We had a good meal, had the Thai Chicken and Tostada pizzas. Must admit, Thai was more scrumptious since it came in their signature dough. They took off the menu a Mexican steak pizza that I would often dream of :( It was the reason for us venturing to their downtown location since they closed the one near North & Halsted. Service by Jay was good too and they deserved the extra star for that... However, the server validated our parking pass and also said parking is free. In conclusion, we were told 3 times it was free. Upon leaving the garage, the machine prompted us to pay way more than it would have cost to pay street parking for the 45 minutes we were there. We thought there was a mistake with the stamp, so we called CPK and Amber, picked up. She denied anyone would say it was free and nervously laughed throughout the conversation. Lost two customers over a garage fee they falsely admitted to be free until dinner was paid for. Felt like a bait and switch tactic.

21,Robert M.,"Chicago, IL",51,50,16.0,5.0,2017-04-12,"This is my first time ever visiting a CPK. I always walk by this location and never gave it much thought. I've always been a fan of Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. So when this place opened I didn't think it would last, but I was wrong. So I figured I would try it out for once.  I went during lunch time. I was greeted by Lorenzo right away and was shown to my table. Lorenzo is such a great guy!! I can't even begin to explain how awesome he is. Jordan was my server and she is amazing as well. She was so friendly and tour guided the menu for me. I decided on doing a lunch special. BBQ chicken pizza, potato soup and iced tea. She then brought out olive oil and bread for me while I waited on my meal. When the food arrived it looked delicious and it was. I wasn't a fan of the cilantro on the pizza so I picked it off. The soup was great.  After stuffing my face I had a sweet tooth and Jordan recommended a few desserts. I ended up getting the salted caramel pudding. Omg!! It hit the spot. I will be back.

12,Huds B.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,4.0,2.0,2017-05-17,"Just O.K.  The gnats (insects) and the server's lethargic energy made this experience rather lack luster. The food taste 'alright' and the special cucumber soda was pretty good. The venue is tourist-ee and overpriced for the type and quality of food provided. My colleague and I had to move seats, without the help of the server, because the gnats wanted to enjoy our cucumber soda, too. I would not recommend California Pizza Kitchen place for locals or for those looking for a quick, inexpensive and tasty bite. However, if you like to tourist-ee vibe with average tasting food and hit-or-miss service... this is your place.

Anyway, we had fantastic service and then realized it was a training center. That's okay. Good service is always good to have. Mary was our server and has been trained well.

Looking at the reviews, there is definitely a mixed bag but the service here has always been amazing for me. Last time I came here my server was super friendly and engaging not only in helping us order/bringing us food but also in conversation. He talked enough that we made a connection but not enough that it disturbed me and my guest. The food here is nothing special but is in no means bad. My favorite pesto pasta is actually from CPK - if you haven't had it yet, you must try it! The sun-dried tomatoes add such a nice tang to the creamy pesto plus you can add chicken to make it a full meal. I also really enjoy their flatbreads and of course their pizza. It's a family friendly restaurant and they offer delivery through DoorDash as well. Will always be coming back to CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2,3.4,3.55,3.55,,3.49
