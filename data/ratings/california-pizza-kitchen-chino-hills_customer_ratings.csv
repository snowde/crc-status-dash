149,Candice L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,10.0,4.0,2012-01-02,"One of my favorite CPKs. The servers have always been attentive, and the food is as good as it gets at a chain restaurant. We usually split the Thai Crunch Salad with avocado and a Wild Mushroom pizza. The two really don't sound like they pair together, but that's how we roll and they are yummy. The last time we were there we deviated from the norm, and ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and the Tuscan Hummus. Both were just ok. The fettuccine was a bit bland and the hummus was watery.

64,Asia E.,"Pasadena, CA",485,403,256.0,3.0,2012-08-19,"I love California Pizza Kitchens! This CPK was cool - friends and I were seated right away at a 1pm lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Even though there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant, the waiter took a while to take the tables' drink orders.  Today we ordered: -   Chicken Pizza -   Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza -   Arugula salad with candied walnuts, topped with Salmon This place use to have complimentary bread, which you still do, but now the bread is upon request. The pizzas were dependable seeing that it was tasty and filling. The salad was okay, the biggest issue I had with the greens was the quality of the salmon. The salmon tasted like it might have been previously frozen, the meat was a little tough and it had a fishy taste to it.  Personal Favorites: -   Sicilian Pizza -   Waldorf Salad -   BBQ chicken Pizza There was one thing I couldn't shake today, the rest of our party paid in cash and then  my boyfriend put his card down to pay the remaining balance of $24. When the receipt came back, the waiter put the ENTIRE tab on the credit card and still took the cash, it was as if he pocketed the cash and tried to put everything on the card.

We ordered:  -Pepperoni pizza -wild mushroom pizza -Spaghetti Bolognese -Spinach and asparagus pasta with salmon -Margherita pizza -original bbq chicken pizza All the orders came out at the same time, so that was good. As for the food itself, my Margherita pizza was okay. Not enough flavor. My friends Pepperoni pizza looked good, and she devoured it so I'm guessing she enjoyed it very much. I got to try the wild mushroom pizza and I have to say, I was impressed. It was my favorite pizza. Very nice and smoky mushroom taste. As for the bolognese, my friend said it was very delicious, so I would recommend it. Spinach and asparagus pasta, ehhh. It was okay. Not worth $15. Go to cheesecake factory or olive garden instead. Original bbq chicken pizza, so good! Definitely get this along with the wild mushroom pizza. The complimentary bread was crap. Cold, dry baguette.

271,Steve L.,"Missouri City, TX",450,302,361.0,2.0,2012-11-25,"Wow, I could get better pizza from a freezer.  The ""Works Pizza"" left me wanting a Digornio's or even a couple Jeno's pizzas (remember those?).  This CPK pizza was sorely disappointing. And it's not like I have never had good CPK before - we used to eat here all the time and be impressed with the quality of their pizza.  Now I'm not sure. My wife and I were excited to have a date all by ourselves (without our toddler son). Since we had a gift card to CPK, we decided to come here.  My wife's goat cheese pizza was pretty decent, although I can't stand more than one slice of goat cheese.  My ""Works"" pizza looked like it came out of the microwave.  The crust was so thin it barely hold everything together, and it was very bland.  The olives, mushrooms and peppers were just hastily thrown on and not well-integrated with the pizza. I understand that you can't just leave these items in the whole time while cooking, but can they just be cooked just a tiny bit?   There should have been much, much more meat (sausage and pepperoni).  I think the total amount of meat on the pizza was probably the size of a regular meatball you'd get on any spaghetti pizza.  This pizza left me wanting, wanting, wanting.   Yikes, not sure you can charge this amount for such a subpar pizza. CPK used to be so much better than this! Looking forward to a next time where they will prove my review wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=220,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.44,3.6400000000000006

We weren't even done yet and our waitress came by with our bill (that's fine, I do that when I'm Serving at my restaurant sometimes too) and asked us if we wanted boxes. We were obviously still eating; I still had a slice of pizza in my hand and I was chewing. If it was 20-30 minutes before closing then I get it. But it wasn't, and the other 2 tables were still there chatting when we left. -2 stars for trying to rush us out when it was not busy, just a small party of 2 with a small order, and not even that close to closing yet.

But it's still good, so I eat it anyway!  (4 stars): They changed their free bread offer when you first arrive, instead of just bread and butter, they give you soft cut rolls with oil and herbs mixed in which is really good and much better than what they offered before.  (3 stars): Chicken tequila lime pasta was good, I asked for light sauce which I'm glad I did because it was already strong with flavor and just right.  Overall it's a good place but I'm not sure if its my favorite restaurant anymore.  (5 stars): Employees are all nice, our server was very attentive and was always there to ask if we needed anything.

Since their normal pizza is so-so and not my favorite, I thought why not try something new? Especially $10 off, I'm in! We went in and were seated next to the bathrooms and the kitchen. There was plenty of ample seating and you put us in the loudest place? Really? That was weird. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was OK. It wasn't very creamy and overly spinached. The SO loves spinach but I was thinking where's the cheese? I would not order again. Then, we order their new hand tossed pizzas. I order the veggie pizza with goat cheese and I get a pizza without.  The chef came out and apologized but it was way after I wanted to start eating, so I didn't really stress about it. The whole wheat crust was just plain gross and the pizza was frankly, nothing I would order again. And last, we get the bill and show the coupon to our server. She can't find me in their system (which takes about 20 minutes) and then the manager comes over. She says we needed to print the coupon (my bad) but she will print for me. Then, she can't find my account to print it.

I'm usually pretty content with eating at CPK - the menu is simple enough and there's a wide variety of options to choose from but this location is a total letdown. First off I came here with my boyfriend on a rainy Saturday afternoon before we went to watch a movie for a late lunch, around 1:30 PM. They seated us quickly but our waiter/waitress never appeared. Finally after seeing the hostesses gather around awkwardly at the front looking at our table, they sent a hostess up to bring some drinks out for us. 10 minutes later, our one-hit wonder waitress appeared asking if we wanted some bread while we wait for our food after taking our order. We said sure and patiently waited for the bread... but it never came and she never appeared again. Service was terrible for the remainder of the lunch - no one came and offered a refill for drinks and it was a hassle to get the check and change.   Food was pretty average - we ordered the ravioli and the bbq chicken pizza- I'd say that's where the majority of these stars go.

The mushroom pizza is super savory and loaded with different kinds of mushroom! The Thai crunch salad is addictive. Creamy peanut dressing, edamame beans, juicy chicken, and crunch wontons & peanuts. A full size salad is extremely easy to share! Also, they make a very flavorful key lime pie and tiramisu for dessert. We order one Togo if we fill up on dinner. Both are delicious!

Every time I have been here I have circled at least 2-3 times in the parking lot to find parking. Service here is great, I have been here in small group as well big group of people. They are very attentive either way.  Few of my favorite items from this restaurant: - Avocado Club Egg Rolls : It has that perfect crispness outside and then the soft texture of avocado inside. I have attempted making that few times at home but have failed miserably and after that I would just go the CPK and have a plate to myself [to make myself feel better]. - Spinack Artichoke Dip: I feel like that is everyone's go-to plate! The creaminess of the dip is just amazing. - Thai Crunch Salad: I have had this once just because the picture looked appealing but to be honest I like their pizzas better than salads. - Spicy Chipotle Chicken: Probably my favorite because it has corn [which I love] and its has that spicy kick to it! I have tried it without chicken. - Roasted Garlic Chicken: I have tried it without chicken, but then again one can never go wrong with garlic! There is no such thing as too much garlic - okay maybe there is... - Tostada Pizza: I feel like it is their signature dish. I like the mixture of crunchiness from the tortilla chips.  - Roasted Artichoke + Spinach: Try it with their hot salsa. My coworker loves coming here because they have gluten free options!

We sat down just before 10pm, they're still open for another hour, all good. My waitress seemed like she was in a hurry. No appetizer options, no offer for bread at the table, just, ""are you ready to order?"" We took a few more minutes to look over the menu; I wanted to try something different than my usual. I asked the waitress for bread for the table. She declined saying that the kitchen wasn't making anymore...but you don't close for another hour? She replied that she didn't know why and went on her way.  My daughter gets her pizza and I get my Caesar salad with added salmon...only instead of the chunks of meat that I'm accustomed to getting I received these 9 small dry pieces (slivers is a more appropriate word) of salmon on top of a huge mountain of lettuce.

I flagged down my server and got the bolognese instead. My lips are still stinging from all that sodium. Bolognese is mediocre at best, the fast food bolognese from Fazoli's is way better.

We were sat down and the server didnt show up for another 10 mins to take our drink order. It took forever to get our drinks and the server took another 20 mins to take our food order. everyone ordered pasta or a pizza and i ordered the half order chicken Caesar . Other tables were getting their order including a bigger party that was seated before us. Finally after a half hour,  everyone received their food but me. How do you forget a salad?! i waited 15 mins for the server to come by and she looked at the table and said oh half of you received your food and half of you didnt? I told her wrong, everyone got their food but me, and its a pretty basic salad. It finally  came out about 5 mins later and now im really pissed because the chicken was extremely raw. Im not talking a little pink, I mean the same kind of raw look when you purchase it raw from the store. They took it back and asked for them to just get me a new one and put it in a to go box since my party was done eating. the manager came out with a free avocado egg roll plate to make things better but not really since the table is pretty much vegan. they gave me a full size salad to go and a free cake which was nasty.

It was a spur of the moment thing and we were indecisive as is about where we wanted to eat. We expected the wait to be long but it only took 5 minutes for us to be seated. That was the best part of the whole experience. When we sat down our server came 5 minutes later to take our drink order and our food order. This poor guy seemed so frazzled. I felt bad for him being a Hospitality major and knowing how the restaurant works. He seemed so stretched out and the restaurant itself seemed to be the same way staffing wise. I gave this a 3 because the service was bad but the food was good so it balanced it out to a neutral 3. I won't ever go back to this location though. That was my first time and now I have the perception that that'd be the same bad service experience I'd continue to get.

Service is pretty awesome and I have yet to find a complaint. The thin crust wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil (+$1.50) is pretty amazing and you can take it up another notch by adding eggs (+$1.50) to your pizza sunny side up (only possible if they have other seasonal dishes that require the kitchen to carry eggs). The complimentary bread and oil are inexplicably good. The Pesto pasta dish was light, well seasoned, and tasty.  The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine was also good but a bit on the thicker, oilier, heavier side ranking it overall second to the pesto pasta in my book. Service has always been great. It's great to have and see the hostess run out to open the door and greet you as you walk in. The servers are all amicable and professional from what I've experienced. The kitchen staff deserves to be recognized as the last time we were there, they issued us a heads-up when they brought out our pizza that the pizza was a bit overcooked on one side (slightly blackened but still acceptable) and a new pizza was already being fired up on the house.

It was either this or wait so we were fine with it. This area is nice because you have a view of the entire restaurant and the TVs too. The only downside was that the server is the same person that is bartending which could get a little busy. Even then, she was super nice and apologized when there was no fresh bread. Which was not a problem because by the time we got ours it was hot and freshly baked.  We usually order the thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and a salad but this time we switched it up with the chicken tequila pasta! Whoa boy, the pasta was yum!

My family and I went to CPK during lunch time. We were seated and had our order taken fairly quickly however there were only 5 tables filled in the entire restaurant so we expected service to be quick. Our visit began to go bad when we received flat sodas. We then waited 40 minutes before our waiter came over to our table to confirm what we had ordered and it had turned out that our order was put in incorrectly. At this point we were very upset that it had been so long since we had placed our order and the waiter was barely asking us to confirm the order. About 5 minutes later the waiter brought out two of our three dishes and one of those dishes was incorrect even though he had just confirmed our order. The waiter apologized and brought out the correct salad for the order. After another few minutes our last plate was brought out also incorrectly. The waiter apologized once again stating that the kitchen was backed up and made a mistake. The waiter then corrected the mistake after a while longer. My family and I were very upset and confused as to why the kitchen was backed up and making so many mistakes when the restaurant was almost completely empty. After being in the restaurant for over an hour and a half for what my family and I were expecting to be a quick and pleasant lunch we left the restaurant disappointed and with no desire to return to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=120,3.24,3.51,3.51,3.0440000000000005,3.402

It was different and soft. Full of a lot of different flavor mixed in.  Also had the steak that was cooked very well. It comes with arugula and also roasted potatoes. I thought this dish was a pretty good portion and something fun to eat.  They are known for their pizza and yes I do sometimes order that as well, but sometimes you just want to try other dishes.

Now for some of the foods I've tried over a few different visits: - Wild Mushroom Pizza - Add on eggs and truffle oil and you've got yourself a fancy upgraded pizza. I'm sure the pizza is great on it's own, but the eggs really take it up a notch! - Garlic Cream Fettuccine - Yummmm. It's a simple, classic pasta dish--can't go wrong here. - Chicken Tequila Fettuccine - Not my favorite, but it's not bad. I think you have to be a big bell peppers lover to enjoy this dish (which I am not). - Pesto Cream Penne - Love this as well!

I came in and I ordered the chips & guac , BBQ chicken pizza , and the Tortilla spring rolls. The apps were taking forever to come out but I'll take partial responsibility for that because when she said ""all together"" I assumed she meant if the food would all be on one bill and not if I wanted all the food to come out at the same time .  While waiting , another young lady who wasn't our waitress came by to refill our waters and ended up making a huge puddle on the table. She apologized and said she would be back to clean it up, she never visited our table again. She came back to the section several times to assist other customers and even stood around socializing with the hostess but never came back. It wasn't until the waitress came with the food that it was taken care of because I asked her for napkins. So that day I learned that apparently the guacamole that comes with Baja chicken tortilla spring rolls and the guacamole served with their chips and guacamole are two different recipes . Stupid , and I had never heard of that. The chunks of diced avocado that they tried to pass off as guacamole was so bad I had it taken away and the manager was kind enough to take it off the bill . I was annoyed because the person I was with had never been to CPK and I was telling them how much I loved their house guacamole but idk what the hell this location is serving , that isn't guacamole. It literally couldn't even get onto the chip , I had to use a spoon. The manager came back and kept trying to plead his case about the guacamole and insisted that whatever CPK I visited in the past was preparing it incorrectly. Okay buddy. Overall the food was good , but the service was disappointing.  The waitress came by the table after we paid and refilled our drinks stating that it was hot out so she just wanted us to be hydrated . Not sure if that is something they do regularly or if she was just trying to make up for whatever happened earlier .

0,J D.,"Ontario, CA",0,30,2.0,5.0,2017-10-28,"My mom, sister and I got together for a girls afternoon for  lunch and shopping. My sister and I hadn't been here for a few months and my mom hadn't been to this location in a long time. We were all really hungry, so it took awhile to figure out what we wanted. My mom orders soup everywhere she goes. We always try n convince her to try something else. After a long perusing of the menu n specials, we opted for the specials. We tried the shrimp scampi pizza for the 3 of us to share. It got really quiet in the room when the pizza arrived, because we were busy devouring it. It was delicious! The thin crust doesn't weigh you down and.... the flavors were amazing! My mom convinced us she really wanted the butternut squash soup, so we told her to enjoy. And she did, right to the bottom of the bowl. My sister n I shared the wild mushroom strozzapreti pasta dish with cremini and portebello mushrooms. It was fantastic! My sister n I are total mushroom fans. Would def order that again. The finale was the dessert, since we all shared our dishes. We again went with the seasonal special.  The pumpkin cheesecake.  The thick crunchy, buttery crust.  The creamy mousse- like pumpkin flavored cheesecake, and the fresh whipped cream.  We all had just enough for a few bites each. We walked out of there feeling happy and content, with our bellys full, and happy with our choices.  It's a bit pricey of a place for our normal kind of everyday type of lunch, but we will be back again..... sooner than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=20,3.16,3.46,3.448,,3.3400000000000007

Waited forever to take my order once I got my food not once she came over to check. No refills I had to ask one of the other staff to look for her. I had to ask for the bread and I didn't even get it, ended up leaving without finishing my dinner so I was so thirsty.  Never coming back to this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=40,3.16,3.43,3.436,,3.322
1,Peter P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",15,162,2.0,4.0,2017-11-28,"Came here with the extended family for mom in law's birthday since she loves trying new food other than Asian. *(hint: she's Asian)  It was jam packed with really young girls trying to look like they're 21 but you can tell they're 15, which made me a bit sad; why be in a hurry to be a ""woman"" and not enjoy the innocence of youth?  Anyways, jam packed restaurant, waited about 10 minutes and got seated.  Place is hella dimmed, which I figure they did in on purpose for date nights so women will look more attractive in the dark for the guys.  (Or vice versa)  Server came quickly and jotted our order down.  It's your standard corporate owned fancy, ""gourmet"" wood fired pizza experience.  Hasn't change much in a decade; the bbq chicken pizza still tastes good, mom in law got steak, which was a weird choice but found out it was actually a good freaking steak, go figure from a pizza joint.  Tried sister in law's pasta, which was flavorful and wife got carne asada pizza which tasted like carne asada taco except with flat dough.  Surprise of the night was buffalo style cauliflowers; I know, how are you going to charge so much for buffalo style wannabee VEGGIES?  Believe me, I bit and it was actually pretty good!  Did it taste like chicken?  Of course not, but it was pretty good seasoned veggies.  Bread was tough as a brick but what do you expect, you don't come here for soft, free bread.  Go to Olive Garden for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=20,3.24,3.43,3.432,,3.354

14,Matmarv B.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-12-27,"I am not really the type of customer to complain. I can wait patiently for my food and still be the most respectful customer one can ever have. I have a clear mind on how things are run. Once seated at the bar, the manager attentively gave us some bread and drink. It was after 1:30!pm so lunch hour was trickling down. Yet our food have not arrived for the last 30mins. Now thats a long wait and my patience ran out. There must be a breakdown of organizational skill inside the kitchen. I have eaten at some fanciest  and not so fancy restaurant when its the busiest, rush hour of hungriness. Yet each time, these venues never failed to deliver the best of services. Upon almost walking out, the manager was very apologetic and so was the server. But enough waiting time was enough. Should I give credit to these two people? Nahhhh, they would have pushed and delivered our food in a timely manner. They only paid attention to our food when we were about to leave. So they ran out of points in this aspect too. No thumbs up. Incidentally, i cant post my review without a star. So there you have it folks..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chino-hills?start=20,3.24,3.36,3.416,,3.3120000000000007
