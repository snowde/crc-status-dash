I feel a bit silly now looking back on it...all the signs that a terrible experience was about to ensue were present, I just chose to ignore them. My first tip should have been the lack of customers in the restaurant. Sure it was a Wednesday night, but it was 6:30 and the shopping center was busy. I thought maybe we lucked out and were just ahead of the evening rush. Not so much. When we walked in we were seated promptly in a booth by the bar. There were only a handful of other customers scattered throughout the restaurant.  Our server came out quickly and took our drink order. One goose martini, one Stone IPA (in a bottle with a glass, since we were informed they did not have Stone on draft), and one lemonade. After a few minutes we look over and see our server preparing the martini behind the bar. This would not be a concern if she looked as though she knew what she was doing or it was the best drink we ever had. Unfortunately, the martini came out half empty and the beer was a bottle of Stella Artois. Thankfully I caught this before the server opened it; however, upon her realizing her mistake she also realized the don't carry Stone IPA...at all. My husband settled for a Rogue and we proceeded to order.  My mother and I decided to partake in the dinner for two special, which our server was not very familiar with to say the least...even though we all had it in our menu and it was discussed with us by the hostess. The special came with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, a BBQ chicken salad (hold the tortilla strips), a pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza, thin crust (hold the oregano), and hubby ordered a garlic chicken pizza separately. We would order desert after the meal.  The spinach dip came out in record time...and that was the only part of the meal this restaurant seemed to consider time sensitive. The meal itself took about a half hour (let me take this moment to remind you again how the restaurant was not busy). When our meal finally did arrive, we were short the pepperoni pizza. The kitchen staff accidentally put oregano on it and was going to remake it. The process of remaking a pizza must be cumbersome and convoluted because my husband and I were well finished with our meals before it came out. This is also after asking the server where it was a couple times, and a visit from the manager.  After awhile we asked they just box it up since everyone was finished with their food and understandably irritated by this time. The manger brought out the box, apologized again and walked away. Our server took another ten minutes to find her way back to us to see if we needed anything further. Umm yes, the dessert we are paying for. Red velvet please. After another 15 minutes the cake came out (they must have been baking it from scratch) and we paid our bill and left.  We had $7 taken off our bill. That is what CPK felt we deserved after having the worst dinner and service we have had in at least 4 years. We will not be back.

First place I went was to the restroom to wash my hands (very clean) I really liked that the hostess waited to seat us all till I returned so I didn't have to play the find game. We were sat in booth as requested. So far 5 stars!!     We were sat and it took about 7 minutes before we were greeted by our server (mind you the restaurant was half full) finally we were acknowledged and told her would be right with us. After a long day all I was craving was good food and a strong cocktail. Eduardo finally returned to take our order. Simple ... Avocado egg rolls and a apple martini. He came back with waters for the table and about 8 min later our egg rolls came up ... No drinks yet. I was patient and asked another sever "" hey can you check on our drinks""? 5 min later almost done with my egg rolls nothing still. I then grew impatient got out of my seat to walk over to the bar to see what was the mystery about my drink. I think he was a manager and I told him I had been waiting for my cocktail for sometime now even pointed out where I was sitting. A couple min later Eduardo came with my drink 3/4 full. This must be my punishment for asking them where my drink was 15 min's after ordering it. The food came out hot and tasteful which is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. There were 2 managers on duty and none came to our table to check on us the entire night. It seems like their time was tied up with a guest next to us for about 20 min. Usually CPK managers walk the floor asking about the food, service and so on. I ordered another cocktail to see if this time it would be different; nope same song.

It was when Val came back and saw our empty plates that she quipped, ""You must have hated your food,"" and thus began the whole ""awful food"" running joke that lasted through dessert.  At one point, I joked that we'd have to speak to the manager and demand a refund, and she deadpanned that she'd have to quit her job so she wouldn't have to keep feeling so bad about serving such awful food. Speaking of dessert, the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake was awesome.  I highly recommend it. So Thank You, CPK, for a great meal.  And I would like to give an extra special Thanks and shout-out to Val, who was simply the best.  Please make sure she gets recognition for this (and you can tell her that it's coming from the ""horrible food"" trio -- I'm sure she'll remember us!).  We will definitely be back again for more ""horrible food"" (LOL).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100,3.36,3.25,3.25,3.4760000000000004,3.294
25,Riane R.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,22,21.0,5.0,2015-04-11,"Pizza is one of my favorite foods in the world. But when it comes to CPK (California Pizza Kitchen), I say only this: their pizza (and pasta) is amazing! My favorite is the Sicilian thin crust pizza plus the four cheese ravioli. They also have a place to sit outside plus it's kid friendly. I remember going to CPK when I was a little kid and loved it there. As of today, I still am amazed by the selections that they have. If anyone wants to go to a pizza joint where they can spend time with family or friends or whoever, this is the place to be. I almost forgot to mention that they also have a ton of locations all over California. The one that I went to was in Chula Vista.

We have lately ordered the same two things to eat. The Italian chopped salad and the Meat Craver thin crust pizza. The only thing we deviated from our order is our drinks. I usually hate eating thin crust pizza. With the thin crust usually tasting like a cracker with toppings. But not here. The crust is chewing just the way I like it. With the added toppings of pepperoni, sausage, two kinds of ham and salami the Meat Craver is just great. Another thing I am not a big fan of is salads especially salads with garbanzo beans. But again, California Pizza Kitchen prepare it in a way that I truly enjoy eating it. The mustard vinaigrette dressing is tangy but not overpowering so you can taste the other elements of the salad- lettuce, turkey, salami, tomatoes, parmesan and of course garbanzo beans.

It's close by but what also makes it a good deal is that you can buy $100 of gift cards for $80 at Costco.  The food while not extraordinary is good and I've learned through trial and error what I should stick with. I'm a fan of their Jambalaya fettuccine. It is nicely spiced without overpowering. Generous amounts of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and crayfish. I also like their roasted veggie salad. All sorts of grill type veggies. I have learned though that it is not worth (IMO) to add chicken to your salad or pasta. For the extra charge it is not worth it as the portion that comes is small. We once asked and they suggested next time to ask for a chicken breast to be served along with your pasta or salad for an extra charge. My kids like the pizzas of course but not just the plain cheese. This is one of the rare places where they have ventured and ordered say BBQ chicken pizza. Now if I could just get them to order something green on the pizza (cilantro or scallions aside) I'd be purchasing stock. My wife enjoys their lettuce wraps and the chicken tortilla soup.

Place was very clean, big, and organized. But to be honest I don't think it's ever packed at this location.  All the waiters and hostesses seemed to not like their job and was really whatever about everything. Made me a little annoyed. Everything about CPK is a bit overpriced, but, it's a CPK, what do you expect. Maybe I'll come back for the pasta, and a drink?

The manager even came by and gave us a complementary mushroom on flat bread since we were enjoying our first visit!

(Just want to say that right off the bat in case any of the joking references below are somehow misunderstood.) My wife and I have been to CPK many times and have always been happy.  Last night, we took my mother-in-law to the Otay Ranch (Birch Road) location for the first time.  It looked busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. Our server was Val, and she was just outstanding (and that's putting it mildly).  We had a running joke going about how awful the food was, and I even ordered the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake for dessert ""to see if it will be equally horrible.""  Of course, this was just a joke -- the food was excellent!  I had Cedar Plank Salmon, which was delicious, and my mother-in-law ordered Shrimp Scampi Pizza.  My wife wanted the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine, but without the Fettuccine, since she's gluten-free.  CPK was more than happy to accommodate, and even included extra zucchini (much to my wife's delight). It was when Val came back and saw our empty plates that she quipped, ""You must have hated your food,"" and thus began the whole ""awful food"" running joke that lasted through dessert.  At one point, I joked that we'd have to speak to the manager and demand a refund, and she deadpanned that she'd have to quit her job so she wouldn't have to keep feeling so bad about serving such awful food. Speaking of dessert, the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake was awesome.  I highly recommend it. So Thank You, CPK, for a great meal.  And I would like to give an extra special Thanks and shout-out to Val, who was simply the best.  Please make sure she gets recognition for this (and you can tell her that it's coming from the ""horrible food"" trio -- I'm sure she'll remember us!).  We will definitely be back again for more ""horrible food"" (LOL).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100,3.96,3.54,3.464,2.868,3.708

First place I went was to the restroom to wash my hands (very clean) I really liked that the hostess waited to seat us all till I returned so I didn't have to play the find game. We were sat in booth as requested. So far 5 stars!!     We were sat and it took about 7 minutes before we were greeted by our server (mind you the restaurant was half full) finally we were acknowledged and told her would be right with us. After a long day all I was craving was good food and a strong cocktail. Eduardo finally returned to take our order. Simple ... Avocado egg rolls and a apple martini. He came back with waters for the table and about 8 min later our egg rolls came up ... No drinks yet. I was patient and asked another sever "" hey can you check on our drinks""? 5 min later almost done with my egg rolls nothing still. I then grew impatient got out of my seat to walk over to the bar to see what was the mystery about my drink. I think he was a manager and I told him I had been waiting for my cocktail for sometime now even pointed out where I was sitting. A couple min later Eduardo came with my drink 3/4 full. This must be my punishment for asking them where my drink was 15 min's after ordering it. The food came out hot and tasteful which is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. There were 2 managers on duty and none came to our table to check on us the entire night. It seems like their time was tied up with a guest next to us for about 20 min. Usually CPK managers walk the floor asking about the food, service and so on. I ordered another cocktail to see if this time it would be different; nope same song. I'm very disappointed with this restaurant tonight. I picked this place due to all the outstanding experiences I've had in the past with this company.

To my surprise they actually sell it and gave me two bottles I paid $4 for 2 bottles the bottles themself cost a $1 at a dollar store so basically I paid $2 for two full bottles of their dressing which is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=60,3.2,3.41,3.44,3.472,3.326

The food is really consistent and compared to the rest of the restaurants at this mall, the wait for a table is not too bad.  My only gripe is the service.  Waiters and waitresses have always been nice, but it seems to take forever for your orders to be taken and even longer for your food to arrive.   2016 Yelp Review #8",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=20,3.24,3.43,3.444,3.372,3.354

The salad was the best part of the meal. The pasta was okay I wouldn't order it again..the noodles were undercooked and the flavor of the dish felt like it was lacking something.

Our latest dinner here was on a weekday, around 6:30, not busy at all and we were seated right away. Lots of tables, they can accommodate larger groups. Clean. Nice location, in front of AMC by otay ranch mall. Our service was good. We were checked on periodically. Drinks, ordering, and receiving our food was all within a good timeframe. We were given warm bread with infused olive oil while waiting.  The food...  Tortilla soup- tasted kinda more like a bean soup, a thick consistency, but with a little hint of Spanish flavor.. It was just all right... Mushroom pizza- yummy.. If you like mushrooms on your pizza, you will like this dish. The flavor is so rich. Yum! Crust was chewy and toasty, I believe their pizzas are wood fired...  Kids pizza/Alfredo- what my kids got. They're both generous portions and the pizza was basically a smaller version of their regular pizzas (prepared the same way)...  My fave think on their menu is the THAI CRUNCH salad. Edamame, chicken, crispy thin white noodles, shredded cabbage, green onions, peanuts, etc, with a sweet peanut/sesame flavor.. We always get the full (large) serving... 3 of us shared 2 large orders, we like it that much... I've tried it with and without avocado, both ways are tasty.  Not usually our first pick for going out...

That is so unusual in this business and it's a thing of beauty when the Chef his making his presence known. Chef obviously knows about Guest Retention! He approached and I complimented him on his manner and then told him about the pizza. He apologized and said he'd remake it personally for my son. I was watching him and he had a smile as he remade the item from scratch! He delivered it to our table when completed and it was perfect. I don't know how long the management team has been there but it's working. The GM Jessie was also table touching which is wonderful.  Keep up the great work CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100,4.04,3.63,3.448,3.2520000000000002,3.794

Our latest dinner here was on a weekday, around 6:30, not busy at all and we were seated right away. Lots of tables, they can accommodate larger groups. Clean. Nice location, in front of AMC by otay ranch mall. Our service was good. We were checked on periodically. Drinks, ordering, and receiving our food was all within a good timeframe. We were given warm bread with infused olive oil while waiting.  The food...  Tortilla soup- tasted kinda more like a bean soup, a thick consistency, but with a little hint of Spanish flavor.. It was just all right... Mushroom pizza- yummy.. If you like mushrooms on your pizza, you will like this dish. The flavor is so rich. Yum! Crust was chewy and toasty, I believe their pizzas are wood fired...  Kids pizza/Alfredo- what my kids got. They're both generous portions and the pizza was basically a smaller version of their regular pizzas (prepared the same way)...  My fave think on their menu is the THAI CRUNCH salad. Edamame, chicken, crispy thin white noodles, shredded cabbage, green onions, peanuts, etc, with a sweet peanut/sesame flavor.. We always get the full (large) serving... 3 of us shared 2 large orders, we like it that much... I've tried it with and without avocado, both ways are tasty.  Not usually our first pick for going out...

They have so many different options for vegans and vegetarians on the menu so I can still enjoy this restaurant! There were some buffalo cauliflower appetizers that we got and they were so delicious! I probably could have eaten five of the appetizers by myself! If you're at California Pizza Kitchen and you're curious what they taste like, order them you will not be disappointed! It's like a healthy chicken wing. Hahaha! The service here is always great, the drinks are good and always refilled in time, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.

The place is not busy at all, and I think customers are catching on the lackluster service here. We were seated close to the other customers, but couldn't understand why none of the servers tended to us for the past 15 minutes. After finally asking one of the servers, it took 5 minutes for us to eventually get up and leave as no one came. There were a few servers standing by the host area, and that annoyed me to a point of speaking with the manager on duty. She tried to convince me to stay and be assured of receiving good service. It was too late. I have had very good experiences at other CPKs, but will take awhile to forget this incident, and may be reserved of choosing CPK as an option among other restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40,3.48,3.28,3.384,,3.3600000000000003
