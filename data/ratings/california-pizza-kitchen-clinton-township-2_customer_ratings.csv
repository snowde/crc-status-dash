Honestly, two of us ended up here because Blackfinn was a 45-minute wait and we had to catch a movie. This place had more than ample seating, and the booths are comfortable and spacious. That's a plus. They also have room for huge parties. I read a few reviews that said the pizza here is akin to a frozen pizza you'd buy at the store, and I have to vehemently disagree. The pizza here was fresh, hot and perfectly cooked. A frozen pizza is good enough to eat, but it's obviously not the same. We each ordered our own thin crust pizzas, which are cheaper and about 10 inches. However, you get six huge slices -- looks bigger than 10 inches, which was fine with me. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, made with spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, authentic Jamaican spices, Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, red onions and bell peppers. She got the roasted artichoke and spinach, made with ovenroasted artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, sautéed spinach, Mozzarella and Parmesan. The food was really good. We also ordered a half Caesar salad, which was huge but really nothing to write home about. They also provide bread with olive oil to dip it in, and that was great. For drinks she got a gin and tonic, which was strong, and I got a frozen margarita -- very good and potent with tequila. Thumbs up. The service is good and the place is casual. The three stars are mostly for the prices ...all the items run pretty high and you have to question whether you're really getting the right bang for your buck. The pizzas should come with a side soup or salad, in my opinion, to offer better value. It's worth a stop if you're in the mood for some pizza or Italian, but I wouldn't be a repeat customer unless in a bind because the prices don't add up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.1879999999999997,2.4

49,M P.,"Washington, MI",62,412,48.0,1.0,2017-04-26,Just terrible. Came here for a scheduled event a grub crawl. We bought our tickets ahead of time. And then were told that everyone ate the food in the first half hour. The manager was condescending and rude to us about it. Accuse me of not listening to her and their problems. They have a schedule event here for hundreds of people and no food at all. Complete baloney. I want my money back. Never ever ever again. Nice showing of your establishment.

70,Ryan R.,"Dearborn, United States",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-26,"This is the most disgusting place I have ever been. I'm sitting at the bar and I see pizza chefs throwing pizza dough, making pizza , grabbing cheese, peeling apart pepperonis, etc. and no one! Not a single soul is wearing gloves or a hair net. Everything is being touched by their bare hands. They're wearing rubber bands and bracelets which carry so many germs. Not to mention, the bartender is cutting strawberries, again with no gloves, whips his nose and then continues. Be careful eating here!!! Be sure to check for hair, fingernail, hey you never know. We received great customer service but what we witness sitting at the bar was completely unsanitary and I'm in complete disgust! So glad we only ordered drinks and appetizers! They only get one star for JT lol he was great.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2,2.12,2.72,2.72,,2.4800000000000004

46,Emmy W.,"Auburn Hills, MI",59,8,7.0,4.0,2017-06-04,"We came here for my niece's birthday party! They had the kids make their own pizza and even tour the kitchen. I personally ordered the Carne Asada pizza which had onion, cilantro, and marinated steak on it. It even came with salsa verde which was a nice touch. The waitress who helped with the birthday party was helpful and fast. The food was good, but the service put this to 4 stars for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2,2.16,2.69,2.69,,2.478

He got his Pepperoni pizza and I got a delicious Banh Mi Bowl with lots of yummy and refreshing summer veggies, grains and protein. I also got the orchard sangria which was sweet enough but not too sweet with a hint of orange and cranberry juice. Needless to say, a refreshing drink on a warm day. Our waiter was funny and very fast and welcoming. We didn't feel rushed. Also, the lovely ladies in the front greeted us with a smile as we came through the door. Great start to our date night.
