55,Jenna L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,14,1.0,1.0,2012-04-18,"I have eaten at several CPKs, and this one has, by far, the worst service. Not just for CPK, but some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  This review is based on my last 4 visits, which have taken place over the last 6 months.  On visit one, our very distracted waitress told us (as a reason she'd been away so long) that they'd gotten a new manager and everyone was talking about it. That was literally true. She never refilled our drinks because she was standing in the corner with 3 other employees chatting. Visit two was MUCH better. My fiance and I came in late and sat at the bar. The bartender was on it every step of the way! We had a great time and spent lots more because of it. So, with fond memories of our last visit, we returned a third time. We did not sit at the bar, which was a mistake. The food was good, but the service was minimal. We'd been seated near a table where employees were gathering as they got off work. We got to spend our entire meal listening to them chat about what club in Denver they were going to, and how one of them didn't want to go at all if the rest of their group didn't get off work soon. Not a fun evening. Despite that, we recently returned for a fourth--and final--visit. Our waiter was one of the wort I've ever had. He got us our drinks, and didn't return for almost 10 minutes to take our order. We ordered an appetizer, which took a very long time to arrive. Once our meals arrived, we didn't hear from him again until the check. All of our drinks were empty, and he even walked by once and pointed at them...but never offered to fill them. My fiance ended up taking our glasses to the bartender and getting refills. Our waiter saw this, yet never offered any sort6 of apology. In fact, he never came to our table at all! Once we were done eating, he actually brought us a dessert menu and asked if we'd like anything. We just sort of laughed at him and asked for the check... CPK has great food, though it's a little overpriced. We love it, and will continue to eat there, but not at this location. If you find yourself at this Briargate location, my advice is to not eat there. If you must, ask to sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-colorado-springs?start=40,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003
32,Jess A.,"Louisville, KY",288,207,1990.0,4.0,2012-05-25,"I haven't had CPK in...years and years. A decade even. What I remember is one step above mall food court pizza. What we got was interesting entree choices (we opted for the tostada pizza, one large easily fed the 3 of us at dinner) and decadent desserts. We went a little over the top on dessert, I must say. All I can tell you is that the seasonal strawberry shortcake looked wonderful, the kid devoured his lemon cake and Blue Bell ice cream quickly, and the tiramisu...oh my favorite dessert was not to be forgotten. Let's just say it needs to be shared (but I didn't). A fun time was had by all. Next time I'll sit outside on the patio. And there WILL be a next time, there were plenty of new pizza combos I'm itching to try.

58,Brigitte C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",12,30,7.0,5.0,2012-08-17,"I have enjoyed CPK in various other cities and just started frequenting this location since moving to the Springs. The food is always consistently prepared, but this review is for customer service. I had my husband pick up an order on his way back from Denver. Everything went smooth with placing the order and the curbside pickup but once he arrived home and I unpacked the food, there was no plastic ware or napkins. Being in our brand new home without our furniture (including all kitchen items) this posed a problem with 2 pasta dishes to eat! I called the manager and he was extremely apologetic and told me to stop by on a day he was working. They more than made up for their error with a comp card to enjoy whenever we chose and were very gracious about the whole thing. That is what I consider great customer service and a reason to be a repeat customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-colorado-springs?start=40,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

22,Tim H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,370,90.0,4.0,2013-09-15,"Went for lunch with my wife and daughter-unit Saturday.  Although the restaurant was full we did not have to wait to be seated.  We were seated under a blinking light, very distracting, but were quickly moved when we asked to be. We ordered two salads and a pizza for the three of us.  My daughter-unit is a vegetarian, so we asked for no chicken on the salad and asked for a special base for the pizza. I had a nice Malbec wine that was delightful and not overly expensive. When the food arrived, my salad was as ordered.  The vegetarian salad had chicken in it and the pizza was on the standard crust, not the one requested. They were quick to take the non-vegetarian salad back to the chicken and prepare a fresh one.  We said that we could live with the wrong pizza crust, just make sure we were not charged for the more expensive requested one. ""Hold it!"" you are saying, they got two out of three things wrong and they still get four stars? Yes.  They were very quick to get a correct salad out.  They made a fresh correct pizza, and when we said that was not necessary, we were eating the wrong one at that point, the manager said it was already in the oven and that they would box it and we could take it home with us.  Oh, did I mention that the manager was sent over by the server when the problem was pointed out? It was fairly obvious that our server was new to the job.  She appeared to be diligent in writing down our order.  We made some casual comment about how the kitchen got it wrong, but she was quick to say that it might have been her entering into the computer that caused the problem.  I like people who take ownership of a problem, and that includes the manager. My Cobb salad was great, not over-loaded with too much dressing and a very good value.  The vegetarian salad was good--I sampled it at dinner that night as a leftover.  We actually took two pizza boxes home with us, the leftover ""wrong"" pizza and a full correct pizza.  Everything was good. So, we will be back, even though it is a bit of a drive for us.  I do like a great salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-colorado-springs?start=20,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007
40,Stephanie M.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,22,3.0,4.0,2013-09-23,"Me and my husband stopped by here on our way back from the USAFA for lunch. Everything was delicious and the restaurant was clean. The wait staff was very friendly. We ordered their $30 deal that comes with an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. We also ordered a small plate that was not included in the deal. For the appetizer we got the sesame ginger chicken dumplings. They were really good but they give you so little and we were left wanting a bit more. For the entrees we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and the four cheese with fresh tomatoes pizza. Both pizzas were delicious. They tasted very fresh. The small plate we ordered was the tortilla chips with white corn guacamole. Again, taste was good and the guacamole tasted fresh. The dessert we got was the chocolate soufflé. It was okay. I've had better to be honest but it was still good for the price. The only complaint I had was the price for drinks were $2.50 each which I thought was a bit much. That's pretty much it.

The restaurant was bigger than I expected it to be from the outside.  Inside is bright and open.  Our group was seated right away and our drink orders arrived quickly. I ordered a large Caesar Salad with chicken. The salad was huge and the lettuce seemed crisp and fresh. The dressing and the tender grilled chicken on the salad was just fine. I also ordered tiramisu for dessert which was delicious! It was really, really good. The only small hiccup with our service was that it seemed like it took longer than normal for our food to come out. And it seemed like we waited longer than we should have for our desserts.  We were just about ready to ask where our food was when it was brought out. Not too big of a deal.

Not a fan of the lack of customer care.  We understand we aren't high rollers, but when your business depends on repeat customers and positive word of mouth and a positive reputation...even one bad experience is too much for a restaurant. Update:   The manager contacted me via Yelp,apologized for the experience and asked us to try them again. I have to say the second experience was 180 from the first.

The first time I had the Hawaiian pizza (and requested it be on thin crust which costs $1.50 more for some reason) and I can't believe I ate the whole thing! The second time I had the warm caramelized peach salad which was also very good. I recommend you sign up for their rewards card too- it sounds like it is worth it.

I love that even though they are a pizza place they offer numerous gluten free selections. I just love their salad menu and there are several other items I can choose from. We've always had fantastic service and always notice a manager present running food or visiting tables which I think is commendable. Today we had two small plates of tortillas and corn guacamole and my husband had quesadillas. For entrees I had Moroccan Chicken Salad salad and my husband had the chicken club.  All the food was brought out rather promptly and we had plenty to take home. I will say the salad greens we're a bit wilted but nothing that I couldn't eat. my husband tried the mango non-alcoholic summer drink and it was refreshing and delicious! our server was Joshua and he was fantastic and friendly and knowledgeable! The one complaint is that it was incredibly almost unbearably cold and I noticed two other tables request to move because of the draft from the air conditioning so it seems that the management should know of this.

25,John S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,8,,2.0,2016-03-26,"I ordered the Crispy Thin Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza for a pick up.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars, and not 1, is because I didn't experience their service, so I can't judge it on that. Judging it purely on the quality of my pizza, however, I should very much give them 1 star.  The Jamaican Jerk was certainly NOT crispy, it was very tough to chew, I literally had to grip it with my teeth and pull the pizza with my hand to try and break off a piece to eat. The taste of the pizza was disgusting. It's certainly not a pizza, and I'm not sure what it was trying to achieve. The ""sauce"" - and I do use that only as a place-holder word - was some sour mess that was so overbearing, when I tasted it in my pizza, I couldn't taste anything else till I reached the top crust.. The chicken had a weird, almost dirt-like, texture to it - but was strangely tasteless when I did manage to pluck a piece off to isolate it from that disgusting sauce.  I made it through one and a half pieces of this disgusting pizza before I threw it out. There goes $15. Maybe I caught them on an ""off-day"". It was Friday, and I'm sure the dinner rush was having an affect on the overall quality of food coming from the kitchen. However, I do have trouble believing, even on a good day, that the quality for this particular piece of pizza would be anywhere near enjoyable. Based on the food I experienced, I cannot recommend anyone to the CPK. As I said, the only reason I'm not giving this place a 1 star is because I can't judge their service.  Maybe their other items on the menu are different; I'll never pay another dollar to find out.

The bowl size is plenty but I would not recommend it for two people. The barley and carrots in the soup were cooked through and overall it came together well. When waiting to order our food we were given bread and an oil based dip. It's good to satisfy you if you're especially hungry on the given day you visit. Now the reason I gave this place three stars is due to our overall experience. Our waiter disappeared for a while and we had to ask another waiter to find her. After that ordeal, the steak was sub par(my friend recommends you don't get). The potatoes lacked the texture of a good steak and potatoes meal. Now the pizza and soup combo was average overall. Little Caesars makes better pizza because the bread was tough and a centimeter thick. However the soup was rich thick and creamy and it would be recommended on my friends part. 1/3 of us will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-colorado-springs?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

When prices get near or above $15 for anything, it had better be excellent, not just run of the mill, which is what I've had there every time. We ate there right after they opened. The waitress kept saying it'll be ready soon, and then after 40 minutes she told us they lost the order.

When the waitress came back, they politely explained the problem with their pizza and she responded that they'd ""put it back in the oven."" Then she brought it to the kitchen WHICH IS VISABLE FROM WHERE I SAT... and had a little complain session with the chef at which point he begrudgingly put the pizza back in the oven and then grumpily continued whatever he had been doing. When she returned, WITH THE SAME PIZZA (SANS THE MANGLED PIECE THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO EAT), like she brought back the same pizza with one less piece, y'all, I'm so serious, the crust was very crispy, but the rest of the pizza was still floppy and soggy like it had spent the last six years aging in a sweaty armpit. The manager then came over (we didn't ask for her, she came over on her own), and when we explained the problem to her, she tried to say that the gluten free crust is always that way: it's not, we know this because we've had it before BUT EVEN IF THAT WERE TRUE, and it is ""always that way,"" why would CPK be knowlingly servin' up HOT GARBAGE?! Like, if that's the case, y'all need a new recipe. She did not apologize but said she'd take it off our bill. My friends still received a bill for their sodas, but did not receive a code for a survey- so here I am. The rest of the interaction with our waitress was very uncomfortable.
