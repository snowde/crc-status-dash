We got both the works and the sicilian pizza's. They both tasted good, but could have been better. I personally like a saucy pizza, and on both of them there was only a thin layer of sauce and it was a bit too dry. It's also not very filling if you have to share with others.

The last couple times I've gotten the pesto chicken pasta dish (don't remember the actual name). It's good but could use more...pizzazz. The portion, while it is enough to fill me up, is still smaller than I would expect. You can choose to add chicken or shrip to this but you really don't get much meat. It also has sun dried tomatoes in it, but again, so few that it's just disappointing. It could really be great if they'd kick up the flavor a notch.

2,Arvid Y.,"Rochester, NY",278,446,629.0,3.0,2016-05-24,"Surprisingly, it was my first time dining at CPK last weekend. I've bought their frozen pizzas from the grocery store, but never dined in a brick and mortar restaurant. I'm a big fan of BBQ Chicken Pizza, so my eyes automatically gravitated to that item on their menu. Marketing works and their menu's claim of creating ""the original"" BBQ Chicken in 1985 intrigued me. It also elevated my expectations. Unfortunately, reality set shortly after the pizza was delivered. It was underwhelming. The crust itself was nice and thin, but I found to be extremely dry and a bit starchy. The toppings were also a bit scarce. I thought the pizza could have used more BBQ sauce and also chicken. The size of the pizza was also disappointing. For $15, you get 6 thin slices. Not a terrible deal, but it's definitely more of a personal sized pizza than something you can share between two people.  I don't think i'll be back to CPK for their pizza. There are many better chain (and non-chain) restaurants that serve a better pie for less. With that said, the service was great and it's not a bad option for bigger groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2,3.32,3.42,3.42,,3.3800000000000003
