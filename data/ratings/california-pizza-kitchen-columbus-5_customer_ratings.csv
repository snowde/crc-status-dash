4,Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3083,6380,5218.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"I have been to CPK many times and now that we moved to Columbus I was craving their food again. I must have remembered it being better and a little less pricey. I wanted to order my staples, the avocado egg rolls, the spring rolls and the semsame ginger dumplings but after seeing that alone would run me $30 I tried hard to remember which ones were most worth it and settled on just the avocado egg rolls. getting 3 egg rolls cut in half to look like more for $10 made me cringe, but they did taste good. Not amazing but fine, still next time I think I'll give the spring rolls a chance again. I also tried the new crispy mac n cheese which I guess was a better deal with 4 for $4. It was greasy, panko battered mac n cheese nuggets with no flavor. They tasted ok, I mean who does not like mac n cheese or anything fried but really not worth it. We also got the orginal bbq chicken chopped salad which was good and alot (full size) buut $14 for a salad you would want alot and i did not like how the chicken was cold fresh out of the fridge. For pizzas we got the new habanero carnitas which was also flavorless and for my husband the meat cravers which he always gets and is the only item ""manly"" enough for him on the menu. Fine but again pricey $14 a pizza we kept thinking how much you would get at Papa Johns for $10 a large specialty that actually tastes better! Sorry as much as I thought I love CPK I think it will be awhile if at all before we return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005
0,Brad W.,"Westerville, OH",44,92,5.0,3.0,2012-01-28,"I came to California Pizza Kitchen for lunch today. I had been here before, but I'm not a huge fan. The waiter was pretty helpful and I decided to try something new. I had the Hawaiian Pizza, with pineapple and pepperoni which tasted great. I had a cherry limeade to drink, which I had never tried either. I did start kinda on the wrong foot, though, by ordering a Caesar salad as an app. That wasn't too good. The lettuce was kinda old and it just didn't taste right to me. The pizza was much better, though, and really hit the spot. CPK is kinda pricey, too. Especially for a chain restaurant. And the line at this location is usually pretty long. Maybe that's why when I'm at Polaris, I either eat in the food court or at one of the outside restaurants like The Pub.  We did have good service, which is definitely a plus for any restaurant and she stopped to refill the drinks several times. The restaurant was busy too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005
27,Alana H.,"North Olmsted, OH",151,98,28.0,3.0,2012-04-19,"I've decided I really want to bring into style the phrase ""num nums."" And this is what I thought while eating my meal at CPK the other night. I went here on a whim with my boyfriends parents, because they love the salads and I love the company.  We ordered the lettuce wraps to start, and I will admit that, although a tad salty, I do really enjoy their lettuce wraps. They have a lot of flavor and the lettuce balances really well with the sauced chicken. However, we had two orders for our table, and both were sized very different. One was heaping with chicken but barely any lettuce, and vice versa for the other. I'll overlook it though, because it ended up being plenty. My boyfriend and I split the BBQ Chicken Bacon pizza on their honey wheat crust. It was gewwwd my friends. I was pleasantly surprised, because I had read some real mediocre reviews on their food. I thought it was bursting with flavor and the crust was light and tasty. We definitely ate all of it and could have eaten more! The 'rents both ordered salads. They've had all of them by now and enjoy every one. However, I didn't ask them to analyze it so I can't give too many details. For dessert we got a brownie sundae and a key lime pie. The sundae was SO good. Warm brownie and cold creamy ice cream. I was definitely a big fan of this. The Key Lime pie was good, but far from authentic. I guess what do you really expect from CPK, key lime pie is hard to make exactly right. It was far better than Sarah Lee, though! The service was generally good, it wasn't 5-stars, but I didn't at any point feel neglected or rushed. Our server was very nice and helpful.  So overall this place gets 3-stars in my book. I'll go back if invited, but i'd never say it's a craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=20,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

Basically you can order any pizza and just have the cheese removed (i.e. CPK has a crust and sauce option that is without animal products.  It was very good--- very very good.  Any my husband enjoyed is non-vegan dish too--- everyone was happy.  I always enjoy myself here despite it being a chain (I tend to have low expectations for chains) and would recommend it to vegans and non-vegans alike!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

She was friendly, knowledgeable and honest about the menu. When our pizza was made wrong by the kitchen, she apologized profusely, offered to give us the messed up pizza anyway to take home if we wanted it, and rushed the correct pizza out to us. When she brought water, she brought an extra cup of ice for us too (isn't that the worst, when by the middle of the meal you're totally out of ice and drinking lukewarm water?). She really knows her stuff. The pizza and salads were fresh and delicious. Got the California Veggie pizza this time.

I would have preferred a bar seat, considering my intention was to have a couple drinks and a light meal. Upon being seated, I felt quite pathetic by my choice to dine here alone during a Friday lunch. The waiter slightly made up for the hostess' ridiculous attitude.

Also, all CPK locations offer complimentary bread before your meal but only if you ask for it! Edit: I may have jumped the gun on that review. I think it really matters what server you get.

Pizzas come along at about the 20 minute mark.  My cheese pizza is ok - maybe a little above average, but nothing memorable.  Good enough to eat, but nothing to write home about.  Want an amazing cheese pizza?  Try Borgata Pizza Cafe just off 161.  Actually, if you want any great pizza, including GF pizza, go to Borgata.  My wife's gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza sucked.  Chicken tasted weird, had no cheese, almost no sauce, and the crust was mediocre.  I tried a piece of her pizza and agreed - not good.  I always try my wife's GF pizza wherever we go and have learned that a good gluten-free crust will rival a regular crust.  This crust was way off the mark as well as all other components.  She should have received a much higher quality pie for $16.59.  Our total bill was $33.40 without tip and service was average.  I have had worse pizza, but was not blown away.  Will probably be quite a while before we return, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

48,Jill P.,"Columbus, OH",25,2,,2.0,2017-05-06,"Ending our birthday day of celebration with a light dinner we left quite disappointed.  After ordering drinks, an appetizer, 1 pizza and a kids meal...we waited almost 20 minutes for our crispy Mac n cheese then atleast another 30-40 minutes for 1 pizza and a kids meal. The server called out it took too long and then offered to send the manager over..we said it was fine but he sent him over then after excuses that the kitchen failed our server returned to apologize for sending him over stating he ""didn't want to embarrass us""...we were not embarrassed..and now I was getting offended. In the end the manager compensated a birthday dessert that we were already going to order...how thoughtful after waiting 50 minutes for 1 pizza and a kids meal.

Every pasta dish that we ordered from chicken and shrimp Alfredo to the chicken tequila .. the pasta was not close to being al dente it was more of al plastic. Family was too worried about sending dishes back since it took forever just to get water refilled. Chicken fish tacos were overly fried and dry. Only thing decent was the corn and guacamole appetizer. Definitely not one of the best experiences here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
35,Nicole S.,"Grove City, OH",281,65,577.0,5.0,2017-08-22,"I was treated me to an incredible meal last week at CPK Polaris. Each dish that arrived was better than the last.  Our first two dishes were the bianco flatbread and the spicy buffalo cauliflower. What I loved about the cauliflower was that even after being breaded and soaked in buffalo sauce it still came out crispy.  Next up was the avocado club egg rolls which were the kids absolute favorite. Served with a homemade buttermilk ranch and I'm not a huge ranch fan but could drown in this batch. There was also a ranchito sauce which was a more spicy ranch but I didn't find it any more spicy than the regular ranch.  The salad course included one of their new powerbowls which was healthy and fresh. The veggies had crunch to them and was a perfect balance of being healthy but filling. A few of my favorite dishes came next. The cedar plank salmon which was served alongside succotash made for a perfect sweet + salty dish, the wild mushroom strozzapreti which was insanely flavorful and hearty and finally the wild mushroom pizza drizzled with truffle oil. The truffle oil is an add on but trust me and add it on. It really adds to the flavor of the pizza. I will say that my fear is that those that are not the biggest fans of mushrooms would skip the strozzapreti but don't. This dish really had my heart and was done so well. I cannot wait to go back for this dish alone.  A sangria flight accompanied my meal + my favorite of the three that was included was the beehive {made with white wine, Cointreau, lavender and puree strawberry}. If you're looking for non-alcoholic, I would choose the cucumber reviver {pureed pineapple and cucumber with a hint of mint} sweet and refreshing. The strawberry mango cooler was also quite yummy and the kids favorite.  The dish that was the highlight of the meal was the butter cake. 3 layers of cake merged perfectly together. The first layer is a thin layer of granulated toasted sugar, second layer is yellow cake and the third layer is cheesecake. Topped with vanilla ice cream and served warm, it melts in your mouth. Even if you're full - get this dish. It really completes the whole experience and is so worth the extra full belly.  I really can't rave enough about the experience we had. Everything was perfection. From the food to the service. If you go at lunch, they have some really great lunch time combos like pizzas and salads and soups and sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
33,Dani W.,"Columbus, OH",105,59,125.0,4.0,2017-09-03,"Short version:  It's pizza. That's all I need to say. The end.  Not as short version: Seeing as how this is located inside Polaris, we've stopped here for dinner a handful of times when chasing kids around and going to multiple stores has just drained me. They're cool with you parking your stroller behind the host's stand, or against the wall. Service has always been friendly here and even on Saturday evenings I've never had any issues with wait times.  They have an app that you can order takeout with, and it has a rewards system built in. My server has always asked if I'm signed up and takes my number, but if they don't mention it be sure to (first sign up and then) tell them you're a member so you can get your points.  I've only ever gotten the four cheese (or is it five cheese?) and tomato pizza because I'm predictably boring. The bacon and the sausage are both really good here so I'll usually ask for that added on as well. I usually don't pay much attention to the crusts of pizza, but I always notice that theirs is really good. All the non-pizza menu items sound good, but I've yet to branch out. They have ""fancy"" non-alcoholic mixed drinks that are always really good, I usually opt for whatever seasonal one they're featuring.  I will absolutely be back and maybe one day I can report back that I tried something new!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

Bread was basically a dessert since it sat in the counter so long and the waitress forgot to bring it, it was brought with the check and it was 2 tiny pieces. The Thai pizza barely had any sauce and really had no flavor. It's really no surprise the Easton location closed. Skip and go get a wood fire pizza at harvest pizza for the same price and much higher quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
32,Hannah S.,"Columbus, OH",126,2,1.0,1.0,2017-11-03,"I ordered a takeout/delivery order today 11/03/17 - $93 for myself and co workers thru a delivery vendor (Skip The Dishes - highly recommend) It took the restaurant over 20 minutes to confirm my order to the point where Skip the Dishes called me and advised to cancel.  I called the restaurant and asked them to confirm - mind you I placed the order just after opening - and they were unable to because they didn't have the right ingredients as listed on the menu. I had to swap out crust for 2 pizzas, and pasta for a dish I ordered. That's fine - I'm flexible, however I HAD to call them to make sure my food was prepared and confirmed. They had my contact information and they could have confirmed with me 15 minutes prior when they realized.  The delivery vendor also had to wait over 20 mins over the expected time for the food to be ready.  My personal order was a Pesto Penne (had to sub for regular penne after requesting multigrain) I also ordered a side of ""roasted fingerling potatoes"". Not only were both dishes cold and dry I paid $5 for the below photo of potatoes, not one had been eaten or manipulated prior to this photo. I wouldn't call these much more than steak fries. And the amount for a $5 side of fries is unacceptable.  I am highly unsatisfied and will NOT be returning to them for food service ever again. Not for dine in and never again for delivery.  Over 5 of my coworkers had the same sub par meals and none of us will be repeat customers. Especially after paying $90+. I work at a massive corporate firm across the street and will continue to share my experience to ensure no one else wastes their hard earned money on food that doesn't even come close to a fast food chain quality.

31,Shruti S.,"Columbus, OH",3,66,182.0,4.0,2017-11-18,"Situated in the comfort of a mall, better food and service than food court. Place is huge inside, ample of seating inside outside. Benefits of being in a mall a lot of parking, bike parking available and the bus has a stop here( who so ever wants to get here, not sure about the number and route). Regarding food and drinks. Drinks are average, their thin crust pizza is amazing. While plenty of salad bowls and customization available for e.g. If you want to have spicy chipotle chicken pizza without the chicken they will oblige happily no fuss, vice versa goes for adding chicken shrimp etc.  Portions are great, one pizza for two, don't order half bowls/salads coz prices just vary by $2 or $3. Better take full and share. Be mindful of that. We ordered spicy buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer, it came out with shredded celery on top and ranch dressing and buffalo sauce on bottom. Cauliflower cooked well, and tasted real good.  We got simple house salad from their salad bar, which was pretty standard.  Finally chipotle chicken pizza without chicken, very well done, tasted great, nice flavors. Not disappointed at all.  Good job CPK. Price and food matched themselves, its moderate pricing. Be prepared if you come in at 5-6 you will get seats, by the time we were done 12-13 people were in waiting on the waiting outside.  Be mindful of that, so fill up first then shopping . On a short note- they have reward program, you get points when u eat here. It's not credit card, just a reward card. Give it every time you dine and accumulate points. I have reimbursed more than $40 and plus 81 points still in my card. That's pretty good. Do ask server to join, instant discount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
