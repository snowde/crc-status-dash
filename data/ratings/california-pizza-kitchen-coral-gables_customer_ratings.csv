124,Cherine A.,"Coconut Creek, FL",734,675,663.0,3.0,2012-02-07,"I'm not new to CPK, but apparently a lot of my co-workers are. We came here a few weeks ago and had to wait a bit for a table (granted, we had about 10 people). I'm a pizza purist (doesn't that sound better than just saying I'm picky?), so on this particular trip I ordered a plain cheese pizza. Others were far more adventurous than me, but everyone enjoyed their orders. On my next visit, I got the thin crust version (which obviously means less dough, yet you pay $1.50 more for it), which was pretty good but had an odd, chewy consistency. It didn't reheat well the next day in the toaster oven, so I'll stick with their traditional crust from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=100,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.8600000000000003,3.6800000000000006

During the typical lunch and dinner times, this location is a mess because its on miracle mile, however, go at like 2 or 9 and it's so quite. That's when the regulars come in. Food comes out pretty quick and the servers are all smiles. I recommend the new guac app. And I always order the mushroom pizza, because really? Is there anything better than mushrooms!? Nope.

As an appetizer we had fried mac and cheese balls which were ok, hummus and pita which was yummy and the avocado rolls which were delicious. For the pizzas, we ordered the white pizza and wild mushroom pizza. I missed the tomato sauce in the mushroom pizza. Don't get me wrong the pizza is good, it is just lacking umph...I don't know there's just nothing special about it. The crust was pretty tasty. Spizzigo is always the way to go for pizza, if you ask me. For dessert,we had the red velvet which was amazing, I definitely recommend it.

The peanut sauce on the pizza is really good! We also enjoy the focaccia bread. Mmmmm... I do have two bones I have to pick with CPK, though. First, service is sloooow during lunch. Picked up the hubs for his lunch break today, and we ended up waiting an hour and a half for the app, 1 pizza, and our daughter's grilled chicken. This is typical, though, so why I'm surprised - I don't know... Last issue - I could swear that the veggies used to be baked into the pizza. This time around, it seems as if they made the pizza, then threw the bean sprouts, carrots, etc. on top without cooking.  Still, this place is a decent spot to grab a bite, but nothing to be blown away by.

So far on my CPK expeditions I've tried: - Original BBQ Chicken Pizza  - Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza  - White Pizza - California Club Pizza  My utmost favorite so far is the California Club, it practically has a whole salad and fresh whole avocado slices on top of chicken, smoked bacon and etc.  I also have tried the Sangria and was pleasantly surprised because I was definitely not expecting a decent sangria from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.3760000000000003,3.3200000000000003

61,Irene H.,"Miami, FL",2,39,15.0,3.0,2014-07-23,"CPK and I go way back. I'm talking about 7 years or so to when they first opened in the area. It kills me to see where this restaurant is today and compare it to where it used to be. It wouldn't be unusual for me to be there three times a week at one point. Now? Once every few months.  Over the years, local management has changed, as has franchise ownership. And employees who were there for many years are now mostly gone and the turnover is high. Recipes have changed, service has slowed down, and prices have gone up. I don't mind paying a premium for a high quality dish, but definitely not for a mediocre one.  My last visit was one of the worst I've ever had. I tend to sit at the bar when I'm on my own or with my spouse as it's typically quicker (or it used to be) and more casual. The bartender at the time was Khat. It took a few minutes for her to acknowledge we were there. Note: there wasn't anyone else at the bar except for two other folks who were waiting for their take-out order to be ready. When she finally came over and asked us what we wanted we ordered our drinks and food. She walked away, pulled two glasses out, and walked into the kitchen. I thought she was getting something or a takeout order was ready.. nope. Just hanging out, talking to people, playing with utensils.  TEN minutes later, and still no drinks, Kim, one of those long time employees I mentioned earlier, walked over to us to say hello. She knows we've been sitting there for a bit and asks if we've been helped yet. Guess what? Kim got us our drinks immediately. No sooner does she put our glasses in front of us does Khat come around the corner running to try and help us. Nice try, but no thanks. The food came out shortly thereafter. Honestly, it was alright. Not worth the money we paid for it. Eventually we needed refills. Again, time went by, no Khat in sight to help us. At some point, the gentleman, who I presume would be taking over the next shift, had arrived. I didn't catch his name, but he was incredibly attentive. He and Kim get 5 stars.

I went with the chicken club pizza and unfortunately it's not what I expected. I was shy to say something to the waitress but my girlfriend edged me on so I decided to say something and told the waitress I wasn't really liking the pizza. Without hesitation she took the pizza and apologized and asked if there was something else I wanted to try and I went with the five-cheese pizza and within a couple of minutes I was eating and wow was it delicious haha!

We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza (the ""signature dish"") and the pizza was fairly burned on the bottom -- not to mention that it took them forever and a half to bring. Now onto the service: the waiter spent more time talking with his coworkers than actually attending us. I know it was a slow day, but that is NO EXCUSE for poor service.

We ordered: - One of their flavors of summer cocktails: The strawberry mojito  This was the best order that night. Tasted awesome and had a good amount of alcohol.  -Spicy fennel sausage and poblano flatbread- It had sausage and mozzarella. It was alright.

I do eat spicy and I used the sauce some, but it was a bit overpowering. I can easily see someone not used to eating spicy foods wanting nothing with that spicy side sauce. It did have a decent portion of pork which I liked, and the cilantro complemented the dish well.

Every time I get take out, the portions shrink by 40%.I have mentioned this to the manager but nothing ever gets done. I've run several trials, and it can be concluded that the portions are different when you get take out as opposed to dining in. Not only is the quantity different but so is the quality. The food is done in a rush, and not cooked well.   Perhaps if they reduced their prices making it proportional to  the amount and mediocre quality they are providing I would be okay, but instead I just feel ripped off. In addition, they always forget to add the bread when they say they would and every time I go, the process of getting the food and paying is eternal which negates the whole purpose of take out.  Do not get take out here.

With the salad, they put crunchy wontons strips, all the crunchy vegetables you can think of, AND peanut dressing - you can't say no! I usually substitute the chicken for avacado and it's the best salad I have had in my life. Aside from the salad, I would also highly reccomend the butter cake served with vanilla ice cream. It is so light (not in calories, but you know what I mean) and fluffy, and mixed with the ice cream it is the perfect desert. I would not reccomennd the tiramusu dessert, it's more like a cheesecake consistancy and it is very heavy and rich.

To give you an idea, their lightest thin-crust pizza clocks in at 1,200 kcal and 400 fat calories. Roasted veggie salad (sounds downright healthy, right) 720 kcal with 460 fat calories. Yikes. Dessert anyone? Butter cake a la mode 1,380 kcal with  830 fat calories.  The lightest option on the entire menu is the arugula quinoa salad. I nixed the cheese and opted for fat-free vinaigrette. They did get that right but forgot to put the pine nuts in my salad. Another thing I had to hunt our waiter down for. I got my side of pine nuts when I was nearly done with my salad.

89,Gabriela F.,"Orlando, FL",7,4,1.0,1.0,2017-01-12,I ordered their food for delivery and that was great but  the quality of the food was terrible. We spent 50 dollars for flat bread and two pastas and any of it was good. The flat bread supposed to taste like truffles but it was just cream and parmesan. The pastas were awful too. The pesto cream pasta didn't taste like pesto at all and we also added chicken to both of them and they just put like 3 small chicken pieces. If you want to throw away your money eating food that doesn't taste good this is the perfect place for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=20,2.84,3.13,3.13,,3.014

Took a few for waiter to come over and get our drinks. Hard to understand him, not very friendly. We got apps, which were very small. More like a personal app. Many got salads which the presentation wasn't awesome. Then the fun part started, had our waiter and manager come over multiple times and tell us they were cutting our pizza, it was coming right out. Only to find out they lost our ticket. We were there for 2 hours. Ended up we didn't have to pay for ANYthing (we did leave a tip). It was very nice of them to comp the meal, even though they lied to us on many accounts. Bothered me that the waiter blamed the kitchen multiple times. Even if it was their fault don't continue to blame someone else to us.

Yummy breaded chicken with arugula salad . They also give warm and toasty just made bread complimentary.  The place is cute kinda has this pizza diner type of vibe to it .  The service is always the best ! All of the waiters are just the best . They always take your order just how you ask.  The dessert, wow they all are delicious in there own way . My favorite is the yellow cake with vanilla ice cream just delicious.  Oh and the lattes they have are pretty great as well !

81,Nicolas B.,"Miami, FL",0,33,,2.0,2017-04-12,"My wife and I go to this location practically every Friday afternoon for dinner with our two year old. We like the pizza. Service however, has been a hit and miss since day one. Sometimes you will come in (not busy by the way) and sit there for a while before anyone acknowledges you. Only has happened a couple of times. Sometimes you get a waiter that isn't as good as the others. We have our favorites, but don't always get them.  Last Friday we went there and they brought to the table the usual bread and olive oil. We began dipping the bread in the olive oil and eating when after a few bites my wife says, ""I think there's a bug in the olive oil"". I said to myself she must be wrong. Sure enough, there is a dead fly in the olive oil. We call our waiter over and show him the fly. He's nice, apologetic and takes the olive oil away. A few minutes later the kitchen manager shows up and asks, ""how is everything""? Kind of a stupid question since the only reason she was there was because she was told that there was a fly in the olive oil.  She's not really apologetic. She only says, ""oh, it must have come in when the back door was open"". She also ridiculously says, ""I've never seen a fly in a kitchen before"". Then another ridiculous comment, ""we have lemons back there and I've never seen any flies around the lemons."" We ask if the olive oil is kept uncovered and she says yes, but she will start covering it now.  Isn't there a protocol as to how the olive oil is kept? This is corporate chain. There is protocol for everything I imagine?  What pissed me off me off is that the manager of the restaurant finally came to talk to us. She was nice enough and apologetic but never offered ANYTHING to make up for the fact that we were eating from fly infested oil. No gesture at all to comp any part of the bill or a free dessert, etc. That is something that is usual and customary in the restaurant business when something goes wrong with your meal isn't it?  Work of warning, check your olive oil for flies at this location. They blend in well with ther herbs they put in the olive oil.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=20,2.96,3.16,3.16,,3.0800000000000005

1,Christian D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,165,215.0,2.0,2017-09-09,"If this had been my first trip to a CPK, I can tell you that I would not ever return to one.  I came here on a Sunday around 630pm, which to my surprise, the place was not busy at all. In fact there were only 2 tables that had people at them. Imagine the annoyance when we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were waiting to be seated. I do not understand that because there were 2 more parties that came in after us, too, so there were about 10 people up front. A server actually sat us, and while she was seating us the hostess managed to walk by us and say thank you to the server.  It was overly loud in the restaurant, with the volume of the music and the overall loudness of the employees. Normally I would not mind the employees having a grand ol' time, but we were sitting, waiting for anyone to pay us a visit to see if we wanted a beverage.  That took, no lie, 10 minutes. The ONLY reason we did not leave is because my GF and I did not want to chance going somewhere else at that time and have to wait even longer. Finally, the server came and asked us about our drinks. He was a nice enough young man, but for some unknown reason, the hostess kept giving him all of the tables for the subsequent parties that came in after us, He had about 5 of the 8 tables. Meanwhile, the rest of the staff was having a heehaw of a time standing around being loud. We placed our order of a salad to split, i got a pizza, and my GF got the appetizer flatbread. The food came faster than any part of our  experience. The food was good, temperature appropriate, and the salad was nice and fresh.  Our server checked on us once, and I never got a refill on my iced tea, which was annoying because he refilled waters all around us. We had to flag someone down to take our bill to be paid because he was still too busy waiting on his other tables.  Lucky for CPK, the other sites up in Sawgrass and Ft Lauderdale are great.  Like I said, if this was my first experience at a CPK I would never return again. You can bet I will not be returning to this location. There are plenty of other restaurants on Miracle Mile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables,2.8,3.11,3.11,,2.9859999999999998

We never think to go anywhere else because it is next door to the theatre, the menu is varied and service is good.  Last night we were HIGHLY disappointed. We ordered avocado rolls (like always) and our meals came and we never received our appetizer.  So we kindly told our server to just cancel the rolls (which gave us an eye roll and annoyed attitude).  My pasta was like warm at best, my husband ordered the ribeye with potatoes and I believe it was arugula.  The steak was perfect but the potatoes were cold like they had just come out of the fridge.  We had never ordered that before so we weren't sure if the potatoes were to be served warm or cold so we asked the server and she brought us new potatoes. The problem was the warm steak was sitting on top of the cold potatoes which made the steak somewhat cold.  They did bring us a side of potatoes (about 15 minutes later) and we were finished with our food.  On my pasta dish I ate three bites and took the rest home because the flavor was good but I cannot eat cold pasta and I brought it home.  We ordered a butter cake and asked for just the cake and she put on ice cream which we specifically didn't ask for.  So in turn we were charged for something we didn't ask for.  This was also the dinner for my birthday and it was highly disappointing.  We spent $68 for a steak, potatoes that were cold, pasta that was cold and a dessert that wasn't what we asked for.  There are many restaurants we could have celebrated this birthday and show at but we chose CPK because it is a tradition for us.  We are disappointed and frustrated that the one weekend we go out in a month for our entertainment nothing came out right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables,3.16,3.12,3.12,,3.1360000000000006

The dough was of a good texture and it was cooked just right in my opinion, not too crispy, not too chewy. It had a nice, warm, fluffy center. The pizza didn't have a lot of sauce on it, which was nice. I think sauce on pizzas can get overbearing at times. Unfortunately, they only had one TV in the far side of the bar area. I wish there was at least one other one on the other side. I think they're aiming to keep the restaurant side from feeling like a bar, but i think another TV won't kill that vibe.
