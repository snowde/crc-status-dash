67,Allan L.,"San Francisco, CA",61,126,14.0,4.0,2012-02-12,"My perception of California Pizza Kitchen has always been of a gourmet pizzeria that serves tiny pizzas at twice the price. However, having visited CPK for the first time this past weekend, I admit that my assumptions were totally off base. We came here to celebrate our friend's engagement and the CPK staff was very accommodating to our large party and reservation time change. They even moved a few tables around so we could all sit together. One pizza was enough to fill me up and at roughly $12 per pizza, it was very reasonable. I ordered the Garlic Chicken Pizza and it was heavy on the garlic, just the way I like it. We also ordered the Tortilla Soup which was good but a little thicker than we're used to. The complementary baskets of sourdough bread and butter were amazing. I normally don't rave about free bread but it was delicious.  Drinks are on the more expensive side ($3 for an Italian Soda) but it was bottomless, so make sure you get plenty of refills and pee before you come.

111,Kevin R.,"Mill Valley, CA",67,13,9.0,4.0,2012-03-16,"I took me a long time to find something I liked on the menu. I wasted a good amount of money ordering things that just weren't good, but I found my favorites (after 8 visits) and now I love the place! The caramel apple crumble dessert is awesome, Sicilian pizza is always good, and the Thai crunch salad is one of me favorites. Some of the small plates are pretty good too. I like the quesadilla and the tacos the best. The Mediterranean plate was too small for even a small plate and the taste of it was off. Tasted like I was licking a roll of film or chewing on the soles of a new pair of sneakers. Even though I focused on the negative in this review, that's is all the bad I have to say.

65,Antwan V.,"San Rafael, CA",38,14,,1.0,2012-03-26,"The service we received can be labeled friendly though slightly mechanical. Our server was courteous in his interaction with us but there were no follow ups, no suggestions on drinks, entrees or dessert. The quality check on the entrees was never done.  We were even less impressed with the food so, when asked about our experience we responded with a slight hint that we were OK but not more than that. Our server took this however as a positive response and took off with a ""so you are good?!""  as he took off in the distance. The manager on duty visited our table on her round and asked about our experience so far. We explained that we were not impressed with the food. It was however surprising that our complaints about the pasta being undercooked, the chicken of our dish being overcooked and the toppings on our pizza being dried out were met with excuses on how it was to be expected with a thin crust pizza and that the al dente way of cooking pasta was just a matter of taste. She apologized about the fact that we did not enjoy our meal but it did not come across to us as if she cared too much about it since no efforts were made to correct the issue. She greeted us with a smile and we did not see her after that.   I was not out for a free meal but I would expect some effort made to keep me happy as a customer. All in all our experience was pretty bad which is sad because we take out food quite often from CPK and are usually happy with the quality offered.

She could not tell me what beer was on tap, so I ordered one blindly to avoid their bud type selection and was disappointed.  The next disappointment was the pizza. I had theirs before years ago, and maybe I'm getting forgetful. My BBQ chicken pizza was just ok. The BBQ sauce was slightly better than ketchup, and there was supposed to be red onions on it. I saw maybe one slice. Now lets bash my wife's pizza. I tried to warn her, but she ordered the Thai chicken pizza. I love Thai food, but this bastardization was terrible.

27,Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",281,1133,1354.0,4.0,2013-11-25,"Many moons ago, at her suggestion, I joined a friend for lunch at Walnut Creek's California Pizza Kitchen.  It wasn't a place I'd have selected on my own as I generally don't choose pizza and never for lunch.  I was happily surprised however, to find that CPK's menu had a number of entree-sized salads.  I ordered some sort of entree-sized chopped salad and I remember it as being quite good.  I also remember the restaurant having an upscale, grown-up feeling that appealed to me.  For ambience with adult appeal it compared more closely to Cheesecake Factory than, say, Chili's, and that's a good thing.  It proved a good choice in both food and ambience and a great place for lunch with a close  friend. Despite my mom often suggesting CPK as a Southern Cali dining option I'd not returned to a CPK until recently, when Yelp hosted an event at this Corte Madera location.  First off, props to the CPK staff at this event.  All of them, from the owner to the manager to the servers were 5-star perfection.  They greeted us with warm welcomes, were enthusiastic about what they had to offer, and engaged with diners and drinkers in a way that seemed genuine.  They seemed excited about what they were sharing and you know what?  They had a reason to be.   I didn't sample every single thing that came by but I did try a few things I'd recommend and return for:    *  Bianco Flatbread is a new offering and was my most favorite item sampled.  A cracker-crust-like dough is topped with whipped truffle cream, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, and fresh sage.  Fresh out of the pizza oven this thing was fantastic.  If I returned with a friend I'd order it straight-away, as something for our table to share, never mind that I don't often eat pizza.   *  A salad topped with Salmon was very tasty and protein packed but even tastier, to my tongue, was one made of quinoa and spinach.  It'd be difficult to ignore menu offerings such as the Cobb Salad but if I started with the Bianco Flatbread I'd probably have to.  I vote the Spinach/Quinoa Salad as the perfect accompaniment.   *  I chuckled when the server introduced me to ""the classic"" BBQ Chicken Pizza.  I guess he meant classic CPK as I don't recall having seen BBQ Chicken Pizza on the menu anywhere else.  And, as ridiculous as that combo sounds, there's a reason it's a CPK-classic.  Hot and bubbly and fresh from the oven it's a great mix of good tastes.   CPK Corte Madera has recently opened a little outdoor patio complete with gas fireplace and amply heat-producing lamps.  It adds to the adult appeal of the place and is a very nice addition even if it has no views (they're in a mall).   This visit to CPK has caused me to wonder why I've not previously returned.  Now that I've had a look-see at their menu updates, a chance to widely sample their offerings, and the opportunity to meet the wonderful people in charge of this place I can honestly say that I'd be happy to return.  In fact, I'll take my mom up on it next time she makes a suggestion.  Despite the fact that our palates are worlds apart, CPK's menu offers food and ambience we both can enjoy.  As I left, I noticed that CPK is currently offering a $20 bonus if you purchase $100 worth of gift cards (deal also available on the web site).  I'm considering it; CPK definitely won me over.  Good job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-corte-madera?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.6079999999999997,3.0800000000000005

SITREP Oh hell to the YUM!  There are many tasty experiences to be enjoyed here at the California Pizza Kitchen (CPK).  Set-up in the Corte Madera Town Center, this is a great location to try some new cuisines. THE SETUP As one of their leading flagship-locations, CPK created an ""exclusive tasting"" of their new flatbread menu, and it was a delicious & hearty experience. And this stop was a breath of fresh-air - often it's all too easy to denigrate an establishment just because it is part of a chain.  But quality is quality, and a delicious dinner is all you could hope for no matter who prepares it for you. THE DELICIOUS FOOD I have to give a huge thanks to CPK for ""rolling out the dough"" for our group of friends with a generous selection of pizzas.  These included: *  Bianco Flatbread, a very delicate combination of whipped truffle cream, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses, and my favorite pizza herb sage! *  Shaved Mushroom with Spinach, which consisted of Cremini mushrooms, spinach, and infused olive oil with Romano and Parmesan cheese in it.  YUM. *  Spicy Fennel Sausage with Poblano was also delicious and you could taste the mozzarella, fire-roasted chilies, sausage and oregano with a spicy marinara sauce. *  My actual favorite slices however were the gluten-free Pepperonis, the crust consisting of a potato-based dough.  Oh YUM!  I was quite surprised at the delicious-chewy consistency of this slice which made it extremely yummy for me.  I think I somehow managed to finagle 3 slices of this baby! GREAT STAFF CPK Manager Christina came over and spent time with us, sharing the vision fof what CPK offers to the local community.  We were also warmly served by diligent CPK staff members Jose and Rosanna whom saw to our wine & dining needs during our meal, letting us experience different kinds of flatbreads, salads and pizzas.  P-A-T-I-O! They have engaged in some new renovations, and one of the most notable additions is the new patio, with large tables, elegant fire columns and a fire pit.  This is indeed a great location to have a table of fires, or even host an entire group of people for a great little shindig!

For starters, their cocktail (i got a paloma) was delicious. I had had a relatively rough day at work, and this cocktail prepared by the gentleman behind the bar was strong, tasty and immediately improved my spirits. My girlfriend and i tried an appetizer platter that was prepared wonderfully. We had so many different types of pizza and flat bread samples that I was stuffed by the end of the night.

After my experience here last night, I doubt I'll be back.  I was meeting some friends who were in town for a dinner with their family.  I showed up a few minutes early because there were 9 of us and I thought it might take a bit to get a table set up.  The hostess was actually pretty quick in setting up the table, and I was seated just before 6:25- my friends were supposed to meet me at 6:30.   My friends got stuck in traffic, so I sat at the table with my 2 kids for about 10 minutes without ever seeing a server.  Finally, at about 6:35, a waiter approached and said ""I know you are waiting on the rest of your party, but can I get you something to drink?""  I was grateful, so I ordered a water for myself and two drinks for the kids.  He said he'd be right back. The rest of my party arrived at about 6:43 (I am only particular about times because I had my phone out and was texting them as this was all going on).  I still hadn't gotten my water or the kids drinks.  We checked out the menu and were all ready to order in a matter of minutes, but still saw no waiter.  I looked around the room for him, and when I finally saw him, tried to flag him to get his attention but it's like he looked right through me.   So, as time goes on and the kids we have with us start to get restless, with whinings of ""I'm thirsty"".  I glance at my phone.  6:55.  Still no water.  For crying out loud, I've been sitting here 30 minutes and can't even get a glass of water?  My friends are officially as annoyed as we are, and we start to talk about other foods, and other local restaurants this NEVER would happen at.  7:00, still no one. Finally, all the adults look at each other at the same time and say, ""This is ridiculous"".  I try one more time to try to get our waiters attention- nothing.  We all start to get up out of frustration.  It's pretty obvious we're all leaving, and at THAT MOMENT the waiter rushes up to me and says ""I'm getting your drinks.""  Um, 25 minutes later you are getting my water?  I just looked him in the eye and said ""Look, we got no service, we're going somewhere that wants our business.""  And we all headed for the door.   The hostess looked at us confused, and I told her flat out ""We were ignored for over a half hour, had no service, so we're leaving.""   We then went to a locally run restaurant where we were welcomed in, immediately served and had a fantastic meal.  CPK really needs to get their service act together....absolutely unbelievable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-corte-madera?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.2760000000000002,2.88

The service was just atrocious. I hate complaing about service on yelp and understand waiters have bad days, but the experience was so poor we might as well have gone to a Mcdonalds. Our waiter George really didn't seem to care at all about being a waiter. In fact I had to flag him down twice before we got refills on our water and iced tea. If the restaurant was super busy I'd understand but it wasn't - he just seemed to be wandering around in a daze. He not once checked up on our table and asked how our food was or if we wanted more drinks or anything. That alone was bothersome but what really got me was how our waiter responded to being told that the pasta in my friend's dish wasn't cooked (it really wasn't cooked, there was a whole chunk of pasta that was still rock solid.) Usually when you tell a waiter something like that either they 1) offer to replace this at no charge and/or 2) offer to talk to the manager and not charge you for the dish, or at least offer something like a free dessert. But our waiter just said, almost sarcastically, ""I'll have to tell the kitchen about that."" I could tell he wasn't planning on telling the kitchen anything. Maybe all CPK service has gone down since I used to go to them a while ago, but I haven't had this bad service anywhere in a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-corte-madera?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.6320000000000006,2.84

There was a place I was aware of that I thought would cater to my liking, but it being around 1PM on an early fall Saturday, the play was batsh.. insane with little kids running about, with the ostensible parents not acting much better. So, choice #2: California Pizza Kitchen. I had eaten there once before, about three years ago and found the experience adequate if not particularly memorable. So I went in, where I was instantly seated at the bar and served a soda. I ordered a Hawaiian Barbeque Chicken pizza pie, which took about 20 minutes to cook and deliver. In the meantime I was able to read a Hockey preview magazine without being bothered (although my soda was refilled without my having to ask). The pizza was filling without delivering me into a food coma. My only complaint was that the crust did leave that 'cling to the roof of my mouth' aftertaste. I followed it up with a brownie pudding, which was quite good. Didn't have to eat again until late that night. No, it's not something you'd find in Italy, or New York or even Chicago.

Then there was something going on with the table behind us which involved some apologies from the manager.  Then we had a waiter change. Nothing wrong with that - actually, our new waiter was VERY attentive and took care of some things the previous waitress should had.  Overall, nothing wrong with the food. It's always good.

Once we got seated, we looked over our menus and the service still had not greeted us at our table.  When he finally showed up, he started speaking to us in Spanish (which we understood, but why assume?) and told is that he was new there and it was his 4th night. Holy cow never had a server tell me that before. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers & ask that the kids meal come out with the appetizers. The waiter asked us about twice what we wanted to order (he wasn't familiar with the menu at all or drink menu for that matter).  Once we ordered all that, we waited and waited and waited until the hostess came to us and asked if we wanted break while we waited and that she would go get our waiter. We got our bread and this about an hour or so after we sat down. About 30 minutes later we started to get our food - plate by plate - some plates missing items, some warm and some plates never came. We cancels several dishes and we orders two more pizzas.  To make the long story short, the waiter needed more training, the food was perfect (except for missing items and semi cold temps) , the drinks were good and the waiter tried none the less.

The only thing that has remained is the menu still has something for everyone but on every other level it disappoints. We went there during lunch time on a Saturday and it was I'd say about 3/4 full. They sat us off to the side in a seat near the window but we quickly realized that this area served as a sort of informal ""employee gathering area."" Employees were sitting all around us talking on their phones, talking to each other, eating their lunches, even counting out their money drawers (that constant ""plonk! plonk!"" of money falling into the drawer made for a nice atmosphere- let me tell you!)  We were sitting for 15 minutes before anyone came to acknowledge us or take our drink order. Orders were then messed up and the server argued saying that we said something else. Overall, the waiter was slow, surly and just had a bad attitude- no idea why. The food is just ok and, frankly, the only reason this place gets two instead of one star. The Thai chicken salad was flavorful but there was very little actual chicken involved- mostly lettuce and those little crunchy things. The pizzas my husband and son ordered were not very flavorful- needed salt or something- just pretty bland. For three people, and a basic order, the bill came to $50 before tip (and, yes, I did still tip although it was a tough argument to make.) Too much money to spend for an experience like this.

Asked three times if we wanted bread, and then brought it about ten minutes after our meal.  Ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and attempted to order a cheese pineapple and olive pizza (basically a Hawaiian minus meat plus olive). Waitress just could not understand the concept of vegetarianism.  Pizza was bland. Bill ended up 40$ for 2 pizzas and 2 sodas... Expensive for the quality and taste.  Always annoyed to get charged for every little substitution. You better believe they charged for the olive they put on instead of the ham.  Stick to a real pizzeria.

26,Mark K.,"San Rafael, CA",2,69,190.0,4.0,2016-08-04,"Haven't been here in literally ages, so its a new experience in my mind! Clean slate and all that . . .  We arrived shortly after opening and there were only a few people here - still, our party of three was seated right next to another party of three in the booths area to the right of the restaurant. Talk about density dining !  I almost requested another table but bit my tongue - next time I'll ask. The group next to us was as loud as we were, and when they moved my seat moved - grrrrr.  Not sure why the waitress thought this seating pattern was great, but it wasn't. A third party came a short while later - an elderly couple - and she was going to seat the on the other side of us !  About 10 booths, both sides of an aisle, and three in a row ?! Not tic-tac-toe here! How about some ""space""? Anyway, the elderly gentleman asked for the booth across the aisle when he realized the intended location of his quiet meal. I hope I grow in his wisdom - but that was on me this time, as I thought but did not ask. Moving on . . .  The place itself is nicely decorated and designed - I liked it a lot. Nice colors, shapes and layout helped relax me - until the noise next door got to me again! Oh well. The waitress, Lauren, was very outstanding. She was attentive, patient and efficient. Food service was quick, and drinks were kept filled - to our delight. She even offered additional ice in a glass for our iced teas before I could ask (although I had thought it shortly before she came by . . . good intuition on her part). We had a small plate appetizer, the white corn guacamole chips. Different, but the white corn didn't add anything - tasted like guacamole! It was good guacamole, but again, why add the corn ? Chips were good and crunchy, but could've used a few more. We had salads for starters. One of us had a lunch special - available 11am to 4pm, you get choice of two items. He had a Mediterranean salad and we had a half-size Italian chopped and a small plate petite wedge salad (hold the bacon). They were fresh and delicious. The dressing for the wedge was house made blue and very nice. For main dishes we had the 7"" mushroom pepperoni pizza (as the second choice for the lunch special), a regular size (full dinner plate sized) wild mushroom (Shaved cremini, shiitake, portobello and white mushrooms with slivered scallions, cracked black pepper, romano and mozzarella), with optional thin crust, and the Jambalaya fettuccine pasta. All were very good, and the mushroom was especially flavorful, but could have used more toppings - the mushrooms were that good! Not sure, though, why they charge extra to sub thin crust on these for the regular crust, although they have ""thin crust"" pizzas as well. We actually tried dessert, although we were already full. The key lime pie was sublime, and not overpowering, although I love key lime and would've preferred a bit more ""tang."" We also tried the salted caramel pudding, which was surprisingly better than we expected. The ""oreo crumb crust"" (what we thought it resembled, but is described as black cocoa cookie crumbs) and the pudding were a perfect pairing. Wow - could easily make that at home! The overall experience was very nice (excepting the initial seating goofiness), and the place got busier as lunch went on but never filled up or took away from the level of service. Would definitely recommend. It can be pricey, depending on what and how much you order, but compared to other places in Bay Area (and this one in Marin) it was not a cardiac jolt for us - $88 for all that stuff and three iced teas.

24,denise L.,"San Rafael, CA",2,11,5.0,2.0,2016-09-18,"We've eaten at this CPK a lot this past year, mostly because it's a convenient dinner spot if you're dining with small children.  Unfortunately, today was such a disappointment in terms of service that it was probably our last visit, which is sad as we were pretty regular customers.  All in all, it was the worst service we've ever had.  Painful is a good word to describe it.  It was slow at every point - we had to track someone down to ask if we could order, we asked for bread repeatedly and were told it was ""in the oven"" even though we saw 3 other tables near us get bread while we waited (they had a different waitress), and we even had to track someone down to ask for the check.  I was so ready to give up and just leave after we ordered, as my one year old son had already colored as much as he could and was getting hungry.  I even walked with him outside to distract him, the wait was so long. While we were outside, the manager came over to my husband and told him that the delays were due to a waiter calling in sick last minute.  When she saw me walk up with my son, she then threw in that another waiter had called in because her one year old son had hit his head.  Hmm, interesting that the second story had to do with a child the same age as ours, exactly when I walked up with our son.  I would have believed her except that every table around us, even those that were seated right before as well as after us, seemed to get their food & drinks before we did.  The family that was seated literally minutes before us, but in a different section, were well into their meal by the time we ordered.  It was just ridiculous to the very end, when we waited and waited some more to even get the check.  I used to defend this place as a decent spot to eat if you have kids - lots of food choices, good salads, a kid's menu, etc., but today was so bad that I have no desire to ever go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-corte-madera?start=20,3.12,3.02,3.02,,3.0600000000000005
