7,Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635.0,3.0,2016-08-01,Met 3 other ladies for lunch here on Friday 7/29. The service was great. I arrived a bit early and asked the server to make sure I got the check and she took my credit card then and had it all set after the meal so there was no argument about who was going to pay. It was just done.   I wish the food was better. The 3 other ladies ordered various salads. I ordered the lunch soup and salad with tortilla soup and a Caesar salad.  The soup was quite tasty but the salad left a lot to be desired. The bread they serve before the meal was about the best thing. It's sourdough and toasted and it's really excellent.  I'm sure I'll be back but I won't be the one to choose it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-creve-coeur,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

45,Mandie M.,"Saint Louis, United States",234,559,351.0,2.0,2017-10-24,My hubby and I were going to catch a movie at the AMC close by and thought we would grab a quick drink and a small app before the show.  We arrived around 6:10 pm and were able to walk right up to sit at the bar. When we walked up I saw a ton of fruit flies just sort of hanging around. It happens I guess. We managed to find a less inhabited by fruit flies spot at the bar and sat down. The server/bartender brought us some water and took our drink orders. We also looked over the menu and decided to order a flatbread. It's quick and easy!  She brought over our drinks and that was the last we saw of her for a while. When our flatbread was ready an expo person brought it to us and made sure we had plates and silverware. By the time we saw our server again was had to ask for our check and leave. We didn't even want to wait for our credit card to be run so we just left cash.  The flatbread was okay. The beer was cold. The service was just not-so-great. I don't know if I want to go back to CPK or not. There are lots of other places in STL with better flatbread and beer.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-creve-coeur,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
