207,Catherine H.,"Wilmington, NC",9,78,22.0,1.0,2012-01-09,"Only one star because the food was good. We went there for a late lunch today at 3pm. There was hardly anyone in this restaurant...maybe 10 customers. As far as I could tell the staff was 4-5 waiters, 1 host, 1 manager, 2 busers and the cooks.  We waited forever for anyone to come over to us. Finally the manager noticed us and came over and took our order.  Another person brought our drinks, a different person our appetizer and yet another our entree salads.  The host did come back by to say hi but NO ONE ELSE EVER CAME TO CHECK ON US. We needed water. When we finally grew tired of looking at  staff who would not make eye contact with us we finally just stopped someone who had not been to our table and asked if she could find out who our wait person was and get our check. She literally had to ask every single wait person and then ended up asking the manager who was sitting out inn the dining room talking to some folks and still could not get the check. Finally someone else who had not been to our table came by with the check. Needless to say I tipped accordingly since there was little service and I had no idea whom to tip.   My recommendation is to go when they are swamped because apparently they get all caught up in their side work when it slows down between lunch and dinner. I have eaten there when it was busy and it was fine. This was crazy bad. Maybe that is why some restaurants close for the afternoon?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-culver-city-3?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.34,3.1200000000000006

58,Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4480,2218,19024.0,3.0,2012-06-17,"Totally fine. Really. Seriously.  If you're like me, the whole California Pizza Kitchen / CPK thing feels like stepping back in time ... to the end of the previous century. The novelty of fusion pizzas and pastas has worn off, but this location on Venice met our needs. We were in a hurry and didn't have time to try a new restaurant. Our server was great at taking our order quickly. We were able to be on our way in 45 minutes to make an appointment. Kudos to our server! The free bread was notably not noteworthy. I nibbled at the soft interior of one piece  that was only made more palatable by butter. Meh. Jambalaya was her order. It's a hearty bowl of Linguine mixed with a slightly spicy Jambalaya Sauce and loaded with Blackened Chicken, Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Ham, and Scallions. It's neither mind-blowing or terrible. It's filling. An easy order when in doubt. A ""BLT"" Pizza was my choice because I couldn't decide between pizza or salad and the ""BLT"" is basically both together. The pizza is baked with Bacon and Mozzarella and then topped with Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Mayonnaise. It was exactly what I wanted when I added some Cholula. I was satisfied. Parking is free in the shared (& busy) strip mall lot. The Culver City California Pizza Kitchen met our expectations. We were able to get in, eat something filling, and be on to the rest of our day.

I showed our waiter the kids menu and it was called,""traditional pizza"" on his menu. Not sure why there was a discrepancy there....surely they didn't think my 50lb son would eat a whole one himself? Waitor did not correct it, and put it on our receipt still.

248,Stella W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,,1.0,2012-12-30,"This is the worst CPK location I've ever been to! It's sad because I really do love to eat at CPK in general. So we started off with the same exact appetizer that we've had the last 20 times we ate at a CPK, and it was HALF the size as usual! It wasn't really a big deal on its own - just annoying. Then my salad came (the same one I get every single time) with probably quadrouple the amount of dressing, making it so tangy that it was burning my mouth. My boyfriend's and my friend's entrees were fine. I wanted to ask our waitress Angel if she could get me a salad with the dressing on the side instead. She went to every single table around us except ours for at least 40 minutes. We were all staring at her to try to get her attention - nothing. My boyfriend eventually went to the hostess, who he said was very friendly, who got the manager for us. We explained the situation to him, and instead of apologizing just told me he would take the salad off my bill and bring me a new one to go. He was totally stoned by the way. Then our waitress came back and yelled at us for telling her manager that she wasn't being attentive. She clearly had some anger issues...

I have been going to CPK all my life and love the food. It is excellent food. So tasty,yummy and just delicious. I have been to this CPK multiple times but today, something changed and I am writing a review for the MANAGER on duty primarily.  It all began when myself and the family all in for a nice quick lunch before my parents were on their way somewhere else. My parents rarely every come down and see me so I was kind of excited for them to come. We have been to this CPK before and well no complaints ever. But today was different. The place was not busy and our waiter was super nice and super friendly. He was assertive and was always making sure that we had what we needed. He took our order and then it all started... But... roughly 10 min pass by and two tables down apparently CPK was having a staff meeting. The lady who I think is the manager of the place kind of shouts... oh im gonna order all the appetizers for you guys... its gonna be great. While my family and I  are sitting, you could hear the manager and the staff kind of over bearing us with their conversation got kind of hectic. So the clock is ticking and its about 20min and we still havent gotten our food. Of course, I had a feeling that the chefs were making the managers food priority and not ours when we have been sitting waiting patiently for our food. So long behold they got served before us and we were getting kind of pissed off and then fiinaly our food came out except mine. It took longer and well the CHEF then decided to come and tell me that they didnt have a certain sauce for my pizza and ask me if thats okay and at this point I was so hungry I dont care sure why not. Well the cook then told me okay dont worry about I will take it off the bill. So yum yum chicken bum the food was fantastic but then something else came up... the cook said we would get the food for free i mean my meal and nope he didnt make sure that it was taken off. He actually noticed that it wasnt and came and checked and then kind of just went the other way after he realized our waiter forgot to take it off. Its not the fact that he didnt take it off its just the whole ordeal that you said something and didnt do it.  I am sorry CPK but this was one of the worst visits I have ever had in my life here... step it up.

196,Ariana A.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,18.0,2.0,2013-12-11,"Came to eat at this CPK with my best friend today just to have some girl time and chit chat about life. I usually have a good time here when I come with my other friends but today wasn't a good experience which forced me into writing this review. Had lunch today around 2pm and our servers name was Keith, he started off well didn't come by much to check on us but nothing was needed since our food is always good and nothing ever comes out wrong. Once we slowly started to finish our meals Keith basically avoided our table and never really checked on us at all just to see if we were doing okay, or even strike up a conversation. As a server I feel like you should build a relationship with your tables so that way they have nothing but nice things to say about you (I work in a restaurant in Marina Del Rey that's well known and I know what our guests like & don't like) but Keith didn't do that at all, he became snobby in a way and somehow tried to act like he was better then us. I understand I'm young, didn't order any alcoholic drinks because it was 2pm and I could've gone to my job and gotten them for a cheaper price.  So on to the bill, once Keith dropped the bill my friend and I wanted to pay separately and usually that's NEVER a problem and nothing EVER goes wrong when I come to this location, today was something different. His attitude went from bad to worse once he dropped that check, I work 6 days a week and get paid every Friday so I know I have a very nice amount of money in my account, Keith processed my card, said it was declined, threw the declined receipts on the table along with my card and walked away. Not only did I have proof that I have more then I should in my account, but he wasn't humble about anything. Once I walked over to an ATM got cash out he proceeded to act like I was no longer at his table, just plain rude.  Needless to say this server shouldn't be serving, or anything else for that matter. I work at a restaurant and he's not someone we'd ever hire. CPK in Culver City you have a bad apple, and you either need to get rid of this bad apple or have a serious disciplinary talk with him. I might come back to this location, I might not. I'd rather stay on my side of town and come to the CPK in marina del Rey, where I have nice servers since everything is better by the water.

As for what I got, I had the ""Untraditional Cheese"" pizza, which is really like a personal pizza-shaped cheese bread. Where's the sauce?! And, in the description it says they added ""more"" cheese, but I don't know where it went. My pizza was as dry as leftovers and left much to be desired. And, having spent many years working in pizzerias way back when, and having indulged in many a slice over my time on this Earth, I will say: if you can't do the basic cheese pie right, the fancy stuff won't deliver either.  Bottom line: Maybe their other non-pizza dishes are good enough, but for $11.29 plus tax, forget the Untraditional and head down Washington Blvd. to Blaze Pizza instead where you get about the same volume of food for 2/3rds the price and 3x the flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-culver-city-3?start=60,2.96,2.93,2.93,2.408,2.942

Since I'm NOT close minded though and I pay attention to food, I knew CPK had more offerings and when I was actually handed the menu, I was BLOWN AWAY at the expansive list of fare... Not including the pizzas! Halibut, Salmon, Roast Chicken, Ribeye... CPK caters to EVERY TYPE OF EATER and for those who suffer from food allergies- this place is your best friend!  When I mentioned I had food allergies, my amazing waitress came back with an allergen guide, which is oh so very important for those plagued with issues such as mine! I learned that a lot of items randomly have anchovies in them (things you wouldn't even think about- quesadillas, chicken wraps, etc), but luckily I love anchovies so if I could eat those items, I would have welcomed them with open arms! That being said, I wound up getting the 1/2 portion (YEAH I THOUGHT I WAS SICK TOO... Since when do I order 1/2 portions of anything) topped with BOTH GRILLED CHICKEN AND SALMON (redeeming my garbage disposal eating ways with that DOUBLE ORDER)... And when our food was presented to us, I was THRILLED with what I saw! The salad was HUGE AND BUSTING OFF THE PLATE with grilled veggies like eggplant and peppers and artichoke hearts... And the serving of chicken was SUPERB! The salmon serving was a bit smaller but honestly, this was the PERFECT sized salad for me (with the two protein toppings) that left me quite full and happy! I know if I ordered either the chicken or the salmon I would have been bummed. On top of this, the chicken and salmon were insanely flavorful (as were the veggies) that NO DRESSING at all was necessary, then again, I never really find dressing to be necessary.  My friend ordered the arugula and quinoa salad topped with chicken and she was insanely fond of her meal, and was shocked that she couldn't even finish it (she got the 1/2 portion too).  All in all, YES! YES! YES! CPK FOR THE WIN! I love this place and I'm definitely coming back!!

Food: the portions for the food are amazing, and as a guy I eat a lot and I barely was able to finish my plate!  I ordered the Fire grilled Ribeye and I asked for medium rare; I like my food that way! The food was so fresh, tasty, juicy, and exactly how I want it! A 5 star for my plate!

Ut she knew exactly when to stop by so we weren't bothered at all! We were treated nicely! The service was great! The cleanliness: Usually when you wanna check a place to see if they are neat! Just check the utensils if there are marks, even water marks on the utensils; I will deduct stars and I will feel uncomfortable eat there! However, the utensils were spotless, and shinny!  Location: The location is alright; and the interior is great! There are enough parking space as well if you are driving there!

I love the decor at this location, and actually prefer it over the Marina. Came today for lunch and had the shrimp scampi zucchini, and surprisingly it was really good. I'm not really big on pasta, but this one is a lighter/healthier version of a traditional shrimp scampi.

It definitely has the California freshness and flare to it, if that makes sense to you. We like the deserts too, the salted caramel pudding and key lime pie are small-portioned, but flavorful and sweet. We have also been drawn to this establishment in their support for local schools and for efforts to support people, such as the Las Vegas families from the recent tragedy.

I went to this place a couple of days ago after 8p.  This place is very nice and clean.  This place was also very busy.  Customers were leaving as I was going in.  I was surprised to see almost all the tables were taken when I went in although the seating area is a little small.  There was a couple in front of me who were going to be seated.  Then I noticed there was another line for take-out at the wall.  I did a take-out order.  There were 2 customers already there ordering, and someone came while I was waiting.  A couple of people came to be seated, but I think they left because all the tables were taken.  But then soon before I left, another couple came and waited to be seated.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza and thought I'd try the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese which sounded interesting.  The very nice and helpful worker told me it would take about 15 minutes, and it pretty much did take about 15 minutes.  The BBQ Chicken pizza was, of course, fantastic - very delicious.  The Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese was also very delicious.

15,Quintin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,2,,1.0,2017-12-29,"This place sucked like hell. Personally I like California pizza kitchen.  But this one is subpar and below average, they made us sit in the very end of the restaurant where the lighting was awful. The table was not wiped well after they wiped it off so they had to wipe it off again. Not only that but when we got our drinks they didn't give me what I asked for and when I asked for a correction of my  actually drink my server looked me in my eyes and said that there was a process to be done I asked for water with mint and lemon and they only gave me lemon , she made it sound so complicated just to add mint. And once i finished my first drink they didn't even notice the fact that i wanted a refill on WATER, SERIOUSLY I HAVE TO ASK ON A REFILL ON WATER , REALLY PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED TO GOOD SERVICE .This is only the beginning of my first and last trip to this California pizza kitchen.  When we got our side of bread it was hard and stale as if it had been out all day. First my cousins order was also stale and cold and flavorless as if it had been out all day and just sitting out in the open. Even she said that California pizza kitchen is usually good but this one sucked. Then when she reordered it came out hot this time but not only was it greasy and hot to the touch. I usually don't like to complain because I'm only a child but justice has to be done and I hope that this place doesn't continue there awful ways of service and cooking . I truly apologize for my review I don't like to give bad reviews but this place deserves it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-culver-city-3,2.92,3.1,3.0,,3.0280000000000005

Fav dishes: Rib-Eye, Jambalaya, California Club Pizza, and Kung Pao Spaghetti.  I also like their kids sundaes.  It's the perfect portion.   Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to service and CPK always delivers exceptional service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-culver-city-3,2.96,3.08,3.004,,3.0320000000000005
