It was delish and big enough to bring home for lunch the next day. Father in law ordered the Greek Pizza... it looked and smelled wonderful. Kids menu is basically a large coloring and activity book to keep the kids busy. My son had a kids cheese pizza and my daughter had the mac n cheese. The kids pizza was nothing special but for a 7 year old, it was awesome. I tried my daughters mac n cheese and it was really really good.  The desserts were tasty as well.

I had the new strawberry shortcake, which I didn't care for. The pastry was very dense and not very sweet.. more like a biscuit, and it was overpriced. The tiramisu was even pricier and tasted a bit.. different. It is smothered in a sort of liquid cream, which was tastey, but it was just a bit too much, you couldn't really taste anything else. After asking our waiter for a pasta recommendation, I had the Broccoli Sun-Dried Tomato Fusilli. It was mostly plain noodles, no sauce, and very little of the other tastey ingredients.

What we got: - Five Cheese and Tomato pizza on honey wheat crust - Original BBQ Chicken pizza on honey wheat crust - Spinach and artichoke dip There were no issues using my coupon and everything was delicious.  We had good service (nothing super exceptional) and everything happened in a timely manner.  Our drinks came out, followed shortly by our appetizer.  We weren't quite done with our dip when our pizzas arrived, which was fine because it gave them a little time to cool before we bit in. I didn't get it this trip, but I love their Sedona Tortilla Soup.  If you haven't tried it yet, you really must! Tip:  Sign up for their e-mail and add their Pizza Dough app and start receiving free things!  I think you get a discount on your meal just for signing up and they'll periodically send you deals like the free spinach and artichoke dip.   This location is also great.  You can walk around when you're done eating and hit a few shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

Plus when I think of CPK, I think pizza and I'm trying to stay away from carbs. Anyway, someone gave me a $50 gift card and it was sitting in my wallet since Christmas. The number one naysayer was not with me, so I forced the kids to join me just to get rid of that gift card. I know, such bad parenting.  I had to try their frozen strawberry premium margarita. I forgot to ask them to upgrade the tequila, but I didn't need to. This drinks were served top shelf as a norm. That's pretty cool! I loved it, it gave an immediate impact and so yummy, score score, score! I had the salad something with chicken and it was really good. The 3 kids each had a nice looking, completely devoured kids meal (pizza, noodles and chicken strips). The waiter was attentive and friendly. In my slightly altered state (2 of those knock out margaritas, should've stopped at 1), I left my credit card and unsigned receipt there.

3,Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101.0,2.0,2014-05-23,"Sorry, CPK... I hope it was an off night, but this location seems to be slipping. Came in last night with my mom for a quick bite.  Our server did come right away to offer drinks (my mom was in the bathroom) so I ordered for both of us.  As soon as my mom sat down, the server was asking us if we wanted appetizers.  We of course, asked for a minute, which turned into nearly 10.  I get that our server was most likely triple-sat, so it's not entirely her fault, but, it seems the restaurant on whole needs a better seating system. Mom ordered a full California Cobb salad, and I ordered a pepperoni pizza on the ""crispy thin"" pizza crust instead of the original. Our server did not bring our food.  I could not tell if it was a manager or food runner that made the drop.  It was obvious that my mom was given a half portion salad rather than the full.  When I asked about it, the person who dropped the food picked it up, and went to talk to the server.  Why do you need to talk to the server?  Just take the salad back to the kitchen and have it re-made. The server and food runner/possible manager interaction took awhile, because our server was with another table and the server/food runner had to wait, and then the runner came back, asked if there was anything ""special he needs to know"" about the salad before having it remade.  Then, it took another 10 minutes to remake.   My mom of course made me eat while my food was hot.  Well, the crust on my pizza was definitely not ""thin and crispy.""  The edges were, but the middle was limp, like, worse than New York style limp. I was pretty shocked by the length of time it took for mom's new salad, to come out, and no apology from anyone.  I'd like to say I'll just go back and stick with my standby, the pear gorgonzola, but that's made on the thin crust too, and definitely not good soggy. To top it off, I had a queasy yicky feeling in my stomach the rest of the night.  No bueno.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.472,3.0800000000000005

They did so we went up to the counter. Jeff was great and the kids had a blast trying to stretch and toss their dough. He then had the pizzas prepared as they wanted them and gave them to the kids for FREE. Meanwhile we went back to our seats and soon the kids had their pizzas. Then the order we placed came as well.

We did a call ahead for a large party an hour before arriving because they don't do reservations. when we arrived they said all members of our party needed to be present to get a table.

After waiting for half an hour we finally got the table...again the restaurant was pretty empty and there was no one else waiting for a table.  The server didn't know the difference between regular and thin crust so I had to explain to her that i wanted a particular thin crust pizza but on a regular crust instead. She still got one of the pizza wrong.  Half of the spoons seemed like they were not washed and still had brownish merky water on them. The new spoons we asked for were also dirty.  All the items arrived separately to the table. we were a group of 14. so when we got a pizza only six people or so would get a slice and the rest would just look on. that one slice didn't last long and after few minutes those people would also be sitting idle waiting for the next item to arrive. we had ordered several pizzas, pastas etc but it seemed like we had ordered nothing because there was never food left on the table.  all in all this was my third bad experience at this cpk and I will not be returning.

34,Sue D.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,4,,1.0,2016-02-17,"The last time I visited this specific restaurant, my husband and I were told the bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock.  So . . . we ordered a more expensive bottle.  When we were given the bill, the price of the bottle of wine was MORE than what the menu listed.  We called the waitress over and she wasn't too willing to help us out at all.  Then we asked for the manager who confessed ""You must have gotten an old menu; we just had new menus printed."" She did honor the price quoted on the menu after our discussion, but I was curious.  On our way out, I checked other menus laying in a pile by the entrance.  There were A LOT of ""old"" menus (with ""old"" prices) . . . I thought that was very suspicious -- tricking people to buy something and then hoping they don't notice the upcharge on the bill.  I wrote their corporate office and told them the story . . . never heard from them.  So . . . when friends of mine decided to get together for dinner this past week, I was a little hesitant.  But I went any way, not wanting to sound negative about things. The restaurant had been remodeled since I was there last and it was nice enough.  But our table of 6 was just behind the hostess station and it was cold every time the front door was opened.  We managed.  Both me and a friend ordered coffee - the others ordered alcohol.  Our coffee was lukewarm, at best.  We attempted to get the attention of our waiter and finally succeeded to let him know the problem.  It took 25 minutes to get a new cup of hot coffee.  Luckily, it was hot.  Then the rest of our party ordered pizzas and salads to ""share"".  I was the only one to order a garlic chicken dinner.  Thank goodness I ordered on my own.  I had their Roasted Vegetable salad way back when and almost ordered it . . . back in the day, it was good.  OMG!  If you were accustomed to the ""old"" meals - be prepared to see what they are doing now.  The Roasted Vegetable salad consisted of a bowl of lettuce with a small mound of vegetables on top.  Same with the BBQ Chicken Salad -- lots of ""filler"" and a small amount of chicken on top.  Everyone was ""polite"" and didn't say anything . . . but I know inside they were very surprised.  Not much of a meal for them.  Also, when a waiter hears that a group of people are going to ""share"" food, you would THINK the waiter would have the hindsight to bring extra plates.  No.  Everyone (except me) had to share their pizza and salad on a small bread plate.  I would have requested plates, but I had my own garlic chicken meal in front of me, so I kept quiet. Never ONCE did the waiter check on us throughout our entire meal.  We were asking other waiters and waitresses for refills on our coffee - this guy was OBLIVIOUS!  Luckily, I had an old gift card that needed to be used with $11 still remaining on it.  I used it that night and plan to never return to this restaurant again.  I'm tired of service that doesn't even compare to the area restaurants.  Plus, they are totally scrimping on the food they used to serve.  Maybe it is because they need to ""pay"" for the remodel job?  Who knows, but I'm moving on to other restaurants who value their customers.   I was with the Administrative Assistant of a local corporate headquarters.  She pulled another waitress aside and asked to talk to a manager.  She had ordered catered food to the office recently and was extremely disappointed, not to mention deeply embarrassed, as people from around the world were in for a meeting.  She told the manager that she had called the restaurant afterward to advise them of the problems and had NOT received a return phone call.  Ironically, she was with our group that evening for our dinner and thought she should take advantage of the opportunity to talk to someone.  The manager was very apologetic, listened to her story and assured her she would receive a phone call the next day.  I guess their catering service needs improvement as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.6600000000000006,2.72

We split the chicken club pizza which was just okay. I felt like I was eating a salad over some crust? The description says the salad is tossed in a lemon vinaigrette and our waiter said that's the ""sauce"" for the pizza, but it was just missing the sauce element as the pizza was plain and missing that something extra. We ended up using the left over ranch from our appetizer for our pizza.  Our waiter Brian was friendly. Our lunch was cheap too, $30 exactly .
