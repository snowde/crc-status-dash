64,R T.,"Denver, CO",0,57,5.0,1.0,2012-01-07,"Had dinner there recently. This is located in the Cherry Creek Mall. Both my wife and I thought this place was overpriced and overrated. The service was okay, but the pepperoni pizza I ordered was mediocre at best.  We both thought the restaurant was quite expensive for what you get. We had seen this place for a long time at Cherry Creek Mall and decided to try it out. One time is more than enough for us. We don't plan to eat here again. We've had much better pizza and pasta at other places in town. My wife had the ravioli, but was unimpressed. She thought it was rather bland tasting.

I like to stop in here when I feel like dining a step up above, but nothing too fancy, and also when I have family in town. The staff is awesome. I've been a few times when they're totally slammed and they're total pros, from the hostess to the bussers and the servers. The last time I was in, our server took our order and it was out in 15 minutes despite it being a full restaurant with a 45 minute wait-so big props to the chefs as well. I love the pizza here. The ingredients are super tasty-everything from the sauce, to the cheese, and especially the crust.

Second, we had the worst time finding this location. I don't know if it was because the mall was packed, but it's down a quasi-hidden hallway by Neiman Marcus that's very easy to miss. (We missed it twice.)  Once we found the place, around 3p, we walked into a restaurant post-rush, full of dirty tables in dire need of a busser. Nothing like walking into a dirty restaurant to get your appetite going!  Service was almost worst. Obviously, there was some mix-up with the seating, as I overhead several wait staff and a manager figuring out what to do with the tables being sat in our section.

The food: - Korean BBQ Steak Tacos - $5.25 - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. Topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds; two small tacos with interesting flavor.  We topped the tacos with the habanero salsa served with our habanera carnitas pizza, which was a perfect addition. Recommended with reservations. - Habanero Carnitas Pizza - $13 - Slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, Mozzarella and Queso Quesadilla cheese with SPICY habanero salsa; pretty good with a spicy kick.  Recommended. - Chicken Tequila Fettucine - $13 - Spinach fettuccine with chicken, bell peppers, red onions and cilantro in tequila-lime jalapeño cream sauce; the cilantro sauce was interesting; something about this dish didn't taste super fresh; the ingredients seemed dehydrated then rehydrated; the chicken was a bit dry, and there was an overload of onions.  I've been more impressed with microwaveable dinners.  Not Recommended.

The dish looked nothing like what CPK's picture shows!  My noodles were a bit too al dente - pretty hard, actually.  The vegetables were nonexistent (it comes with onion, bell peppers and cilantro), as was the case with the chicken.  There went my $14.

When we lived in Brooklyn we walked to locally-owned restaurants for dinner and I don't think my kids experienced a chain restaurant or strip mall eating experience until we moved to the suburbs of Colorado. Again, I don't mean this to sound snobby or anything, but I am kind of bummed by mall dining. All that being said, my kids absolutely love California Pizza Kitchen and it's their number one dining choice when given the option. They love the kids menu, which I think is well-priced and pretty comprehensive. Highlights: crispy chicken with a vegetable (tonight it was broccoli rabe!), mushroom-pepperoni-sausage pizza (for real!), and noodles. Just plain buttered noodles. Throw in a drink like apple juice and everyone is happy for at least 15 minutes. I'm actually pretty into the salad selection. I have deluded myself into thinking that I'm dieting by choosing the salad option, but tonight I had the Thai Crunch, a very tasty combination of edamame, shredded cabbage, crispy wonton noodles, and lots and lots of peanuts. It's very tasty and probably has tons of grams of fat! My issue with this location is the crazy parking. I couldn't tell if the valet was free only for BMWs or cars from a certain dealer or what.

I had a Bloody Mary (they only have mix, no V8 or tomato juice, and it tasted very mix-y.. I swear I can taste HFCS. Is that possible? haha). I would not order it again. Appetizer was the hummus dip with whole wheat pita bread, and that was pretty great. Main was the Fire-Roasted Chile Relleno. I was SO excited about this - I had a stuffed poblano ages ago at a proper Mexican place, and it was phenomenal, so I was really happy to see it on the menu here. What I got was a very bland dish. It just seemed like it was missing something. For being a freaking pepper, there was no flavour. I think this could have been great with some hot salsa or even a bit of pico de gallo -- anything to liven it up a little. All the ingredients turned into one big mush. We had a really nice waiter which made our experience a bit better, but CPK just isn't a place to go nuts over. It's good for people-watching, if you're into that. Me, I was car-watching.

The food tastes the same no matter which one I go to. I always get the same things - the California Club pizza, the Chicken Tortilla Soup, and the Mediterranean Foccacia on the Small Plates menu. They are always good (the soup is beyond delicious!) and always the same which I can appreciate (although they have changed the mayo on the club pizza to a lemon-pepper mayo but it was very good). There is nothing amazing about CPK but the food is good, filling, and not incredibly pricey for what you get.  My 3-star rating really was based on my experience last night for Veteran's Day. This was my second year going and I was really excited as last year the service was great. I took a friend of mine last night and told her how great they were and that they had thanked me for my service so many times last year that it was almost overwhelming - but deeply appreciated. Last night, after showing my ID, our server barely acknowledged it nor did she even regard me as a veteran. As a matter of fact, she turned it into a conversation about herself! It was honestly embarassing as I had built them up so much and then to have them not once mention Veteran's Day in front of my friend, well, I kind of felt silly.  I did not join the military or serve for 10 years for free food or for recongnition - none of us do - but on a day devoted to veterans, a simple thank you goes a long way. I didn't even get that - which was pretty surprising after eating at Applebees and Einstein's earlier in the day where they were so incredibly genuine in their thank you's.  I won't return next year as I just found this almost disrespectful and had to wonder how many other veterans had the same experience.

Came in on a Friday afternoon, around 1p. Not super busy. After waiting a long time for a hostess to seat us, we sit down to a disgustingly dirty table that has other people's unfinished drinks on it. Seriously?  We wait at least 10 minutes if not longer to meet our server, who is clearly slammed and clearly doesn't have any time for us, let alone the nasty table we've been seated at. We flag down a different server to get the table cleaned. Someone comes over. As the bus boy is cleaning the table, the giant circles he is wiping the table with are flinging all of the crumbs that used to be on the table right into my lap. Never noticed, even though I'm sure I looked totally disgusted. He missed a lot of spots, but I didn't want to say anything lest I be covered in someone else's food. Speaking of food. It takes forever, even though we ordered right away since the server was so ungodly slow the first time. By the time we get the spinach dip, it's cold. We probably would have considered getting a different one, or getting it warmed up, but seriously, that server couldn't have run away from the table any faster than if she were being chased by the boys in blue. We get the pizza. The gluten-free crust is DISGUSTING. DOMINOES HAS BETTER GLUTEN FREE CRUST. My girlfriend is unhappy with her pizza and gets a salad instead. By the time all of this goes down, we just want to leave. The only redemption is that after telling a manager, he gave us our money back. Every other moment spent here was awful.

After hearing a few recommendations we opted to add strawberry sauce on top and it took the flavor to a new level.  The manager Lucas and our waiter Felipe did a fabulous job of taking care of us.

We then ordered the small wedge salad but being vegetarians we asked that the bacon and egg be removed and we added avocado and red onion instead. We also requested the herb ranch instead of the blue cheese. It came out just as we had requested and it was as delicious as ever. My sister loved it!  Jesus had recommended the mac and cheese bites earlier when we told him we were vegetarian, so we decided to get them. Man o man, my sister loved them!

It is disgusting to have that much facial hair in the food industry!!  I observed him and he seems very upbeat, nice smile and good at his job too - but if he had been assigned to our table, I would have requested another server.  There should be some sort of grooming policy put in to place.**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

I called back to see if the driver was still in the area and if he could swing back by with some. Apparently the drivers aren't part of the restaurant.

I've had to practically beg for bread with my meal, and almost didn't get water one day, even though I requested it. I usually get to-go and the people at the bar, even though are nice, never seem to have it together and have a tendency to make me feel like I'm putting them out. I have had to wait up to 15 minutes from the time I placed an order to get soup and bread. Slowest service ever.

24,Meredith C.,"Chicago, IL",234,248,122.0,4.0,2017-04-24,"Once upon a time, I lived near Oakbrook mall in Illinois. At that time, it seems like whenever I was there and Hangry, the only choices for food were CPK, Houlihans or Thai basil. The CPK menu at that time was limited and it was only when I was in the mood for the barbecue chicken pizza, that I would endeavor the trek upstairs to indulge in this treat.   I have been in Denver for nearly 5 years and have not eaten CPK since in at least six. Recently, however, a friend suggested it when we were in the mall and starving. I was super stoked to read there obviously re-conceived and matured menu. I enjoyed what I ate (lunch duo: super spinach & quinoa salad & shaved mushroom & spinach pizza) and also sampled my friend's offerings including her mushroom, pepperoni, sausage pizza & strawberry mango cooler.  The food tastes fresh and innovative. It has great flavor and is served with care and precision which is unusual for a chain restaurant in my opinion & experience.  I enjoyed it so much as a matter of fact, that I actually signed up for their loyalty program.  Looking forward to my next visit which I'm hoping is this upcoming Tuesday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6,3.48,3.16,3.16,,3.2880000000000007

In addition, I had to go up and  ask the bartender to order my sangria as our server never returned to our table to take my drink order..

20,Jordan S.,"Denver, CO",124,76,11.0,4.0,2017-08-06,"We dined here today (Sunday) at around 11:15 just after the mall opened. It was really not busy with only 2-3 other parties inside. The hostess seated us quickly and asked if we had been in before and how long it had been since the last time. Thought that was a really bizarre question, especially because there was no follow up to my answer, she just walked away. It quickly became clear why this is relevant... we received a couple complimentary pieces of pizza, delivered by a manager on duty, accompanied by a coupon for free small plate on a future visit. The food was delicious and fresh. Our service was outstanding. CPK has really improved its standards and menu offerings and overall atmosphere. The problem for this location lies in the fact that Denver is expanding too quickly and people are moving away from chain restaurant dining.. especially at a mall that now charges for parking after one hour for which I don't believe is enough time to eat a meal here and for which I don't believe they offer validation. I predict this location will fail although it doesn't deserve to.

21,Lex S.,"Denver, CO",124,158,260.0,2.0,2017-10-09,"CPK is a great chain restaurant, but I really wasn't impressed with this location at all. First of all, we walked in and there was no one there at the front desk... which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact we waited there for about five minutes and not a single employee acknowledged us! There were plenty of servers walking around that looked at a us a couple of times and that was it. It kind of seemed like they had a ""not my problem attitude"". I decided to stare down one of the servers and maybe that's the reason he finally came and got us set up with a table. So if you've ever been to a CPK, they normally bring you a plate of fresh bread for your table. Well, this is a first for me at CPK... our server brought my boyfriend and I TWO pieces of bread and it was hard and stale. I just kind of laughed at the fact he really just brought us TWO pieces of bread. The bread tasted like it was made the day before. Once we finished the two pieces of stale bread, our server asked if we wanted more. So we said yes and again, he brings us TWO pieces. Is this location stingy with their bread? That bread was actually hot, but the bottom was hard as a rock. After we finished that, I guess we reached our limit on bread because the server never brought us more. I ordered the cucumber lime refresher. It tasted great, like it normally does, but the mint in it was all old and browning. I would be embarrassed to server something like that. Our entrees were great, but my experience here wasn't. I would not come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6,3.32,3.11,3.11,,3.194
