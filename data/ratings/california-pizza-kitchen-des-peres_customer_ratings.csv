5,Margo C.,"Saint Louis, MO",65,137,,5.0,2012-11-15,"The gift that keeps on giving! This last weekend CPK thanked our veterans with a free pizza of choice and a non-alcoholic beverage. My husband stopped in while I was shopping and got a Pepperoni Pizza and a Latte. He took the pizza home for our son who is a college graduate. He still lives at home and we still feed him ( I blame Obama ) I keed, I keed. ; )` well, sorta... Anyway, as he was thanking the server she gave him a card which thanked the veteran's for their service.  It included another free pizza and non-alcoholic beverage if used by November 25th. Today, I stopped in and presented the card to my server. She was very cordial. I ordered the Jamacian Jerk Chicken Thin Crust Pizza. It was sweet and spicy at the same time.  CPK not being a Saint Louis Company, I knew I did not have to sweat the Provel thing. The crust was nice and crisp!  Double thanks CPK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572
4,Jonina S.,"Saint Louis, MO",86,118,2.0,4.0,2013-01-02,"I have gone to this location several times simply because I can shop afterward plus I really like the small plates menu. They are all good but I like these the most....arugala salad, chicken quesadilla (not too spicy),  white corn guacamole, and the Mediterranean Focaccia. This place is obviously packed around any meal time. The wait time is reasonable if it is. The hostesses are nice and always courteous. The waiters and waitresses are always attentive and definitely nice.  Some times waiting for our food can take a bit longer than it should, in my opinion.  Their food is always pretty great. If I had to offer what NOT to get is the Irish coffee and hot chocolate. That is NOT Irish coffee the way it's been made for me...sweet and not bitter. Their hot chocolate is more like water. You are just better off with water!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001
1,Fran M.,"Saint Louis, MO",193,148,718.0,4.0,2013-05-01,"I love this CPK! It's located next to Macy's and Barnes and Noble at West County Center...perfect because that's my favorite place to park at the mall! I've tried several items off the menu, and it's all good...really...but I found my new favorite...Carnitas Tacos! OMG. I'm craving as we speak...or type...or whatever. The food bliss craving going on in my head is responsible for the quality of this ramble.  These tacos were sooo good. The pork was crispy, the avocado and pico was super fresh, and the whole dish had just the right amount of spiciness. I'll keep going back just for this meal. The service was fantastic and fast, and of course the price is just right.  This spot is great place to eat, mall people watch, and rest your weary bones after a day of shopping...and then you can roll yourself out the door to the parking lot just a few steps right outside.  But that's just me.

2,Robert J.,"Fenton, MO",46,129,26.0,4.0,2013-12-27,"Always been a fan of CPK and I have to stay they rarely dissapoint me.  I do admit that I usually don't stray from my usual menu items though. Just about everything I have tasted here is good.  There is something to say about a chain restaurant and that is you can always expect consistency, good or bad. I often get the BBQ chicken salad.  The flavors in this salad really come together.  The BBQ and ranch work well together.  There is just enough BBQ sauce that it adds the flavor you want.  The tortilla strips add the texture and crunch.  It is hard to not get this because it tastes so good.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is my second favorite.  I love the peanut sauce.  All their pizzas have a really good crust, it is cooked well on the bottom but not too crispy.  Basically you can't go wrong with any of the salads, they are always fresh and look very appetizing when served.  Same with the pizzas,  consistenlty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

7,Holly H.,"Imperial, MO",99,139,154.0,4.0,2014-03-11,"I've always been a big fan of CPK. It's a great spot to stop for lunch or dinner during a shopping trip at the mall. It's a casual and welcoming place where you can expect to find families, couples, and groups of friends. The food here has always been consistent. CPK is one of the few places where I actually crave a salad. Their salads are SO good! There are several options ranging from your typical cobb, to Asian inspired, to barbeque chicken, to warm roasted veggies... just to name a few! My personal favorite is the chicken waldorf, which consists of grilled chicken, apples, grapes, celery, candied walnuts, and blue cheese set on top a bed of mixed greens and topped with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I'm craving one now just thinking about it! Of course, CPK is known for their pizzas, and for good reason... they are also very tasty! Just as the salads, they offer so many pizza varieties including several unique specialties and a few different crust options to choose from. When I do order pizza, I go with a simple pepperoni on honey wheat crust. Sometimes simple is best. They also offer a number of pasta dishes, and my husband absolutely loves the spicy kung pao spaghetti. All in all, this is a great place to stop and recharge while at West County Mall. They offer a little something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20,,,,,

28,Joan G.,"Saint Louis, MO",182,334,1461.0,3.0,2015-08-21,"We came for lunch with my family and we were seated promptly  ( of course we got there at 11:30).  Menus were given out and our waitress Caitlyn took our drink order.  Bread was brought with an olive oil herb dip. Just a basic herb dip.  We all ordered salads. You have a choice between a full or half a salad.  We all ordered half salads and they are a great size.  Mike had the Moraccan (I don't know how to spell that) salad that he said was good, but the inflection in his voice said he probably would not order that again.  He said it had an odd flavor to it. I had the Ceasar Salad with shrimp.  The salad was good, the shrimp were tasty, but what really irritates me is when a restaurant doesn't use real ceasar dressing.  I want to taste the smashed up anchovies in my dressing.  If you don't have that, then you just have creamy Italian dressing.  I would order a different type of salad next time.  My brother's Cobb Salad looked wonderful.   For a chain restaurant, this has good food and a good menu.  This one was located in the West County Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres,,,,,
25,Kitty W.,"Saint Louis, MO",175,269,2214.0,3.0,2016-01-12,"Believe it or not, I made my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) just a few days ago. I'm 33. We didn't have them in my part of Texas, and although I've lived in St. Louis for six years, my husband always has refused to eat here. He claimed the pizza was too ""exotic"" for him, and he was partially right. He's strictly a pepperoni guy, and CPK has some interesting flavor combinations on the menu. I completely understand how the Thai Chicken or California Club pizzas might intimidate him. I mean, both of those pizzas practically have salads on top of them. That's, like, as far away from pepperoni as you can get.  So, my first visit to CPK ended up being with someone else.  And I learned something. Actually, I've learned a few things. 1. Complimentary bread is served while you wait for your meal. Warning! It's sourdough. 2. They offer only one size of pizza, but their thin-crust pizzas are slightly larger in diameter than their hand-tossed pies. I do not know the diameter size in inches, but the pizzas are larger than a typical personal pizza. Each pizza is cut into six slices. In my opinion, two people could easily share one pizza especially if ordering salads and/or appetizers.  [Note: I actually was surprised they only offered one pizza size. I had been expecting lunch specials with personal pizzas, but I have since discovered some locations have a ""reimagined menu"" with ""lunch duos"": a 7"" pizza or half a sandwich with your choice of soup or salad. Or, simply soup and salad. Selections, however, are greatly limited.]  3. They can make half-and-half pizzas in some cases, but there might be a surcharge. For example, there was a $2 surcharge on my half-Tostada and half-Margherita pizza because the two pizzas had different base sauces.  4. They offer a completely normal pepperoni pizza. Well, it's normal as long as you don't pay extra to add white truffle oil to it. I kind of assumed they must have a classic pepperoni pizza, and my initial visit confirmed it. Guess what that meant! If my first visit was successful (and it pretty much was), the husband could make return visits to CPK with me! No excuses!  5. The crust is foldable. I've now had a ""crispy"" thin-crust and a hand-tossed pizza here, and honestly, the two crusts seemed similar to me. The main difference was around the perimeter of the pizza. The thin-crust pizza had a crispy circumference, while the hand-tossed pizza had a nice, bread-y edge. However, the interior crust of both pizzas was thin and limp. The pizzas were NOT undercooked and had good flavors, but I had to fold the pieces along the radii in order to eat them. 6. You can spend a pretty penny here. Including the tip, my first visit cost $40 for two sodas, a pizza, and a half salad. My second visit ended up being a little cheaper because the husband doesn't drink soda, and I received a free small plate by signing up for their Pizza Dough Rewards. (I selected the asparagus and arugula salad from the small plate menu. Yum! I would definitely order that again!)  --- CPK loses a couple of stars for their limp crust and high prices. I prefer Dewey's, which is somewhat comparable, but I'll be a return customer here for sure. So will my husband. He has conquered his fear of this ""exotic"" pizza place, but because this location is at a mall, his concern now is that I'll make him go to Sephora with me after our meal. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres,,,,,

However, I obviously had no idea that they had so much more! We got their tortilla spring rolls as an appetizer and they were so good.

He asked if I wanted a refill on soda as my glass was empty and I wasn't even 1/2 way through my meal.  He wasn't in a hurry to bring my refill for over 5 minutes.  He only had our table and one other.  When we would look for him he was no where to be found.  I'm not sure where he was, since all of the other wait staff were walking around.  The food was goid, but service not so much.  I will be going back since the food wasn't the issue.  Hopefully service next time will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres,,,,,

The portion was a little light but what a great dish! So flavorful! The service here is still odd but like anything else your experience depends completely on who is there when you are there.
