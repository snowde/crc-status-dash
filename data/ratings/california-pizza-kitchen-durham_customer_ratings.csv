I got the thin crust cali club, but the mayo and lettuce was overwhelming. The crust was sweet. Avocado was great, but the bacon and tomato could have been more plentiful. Sitting outside on the patio is great on a nice weather day, but they really need to do something about the wasps. Maybe hang a few wasp catchers. They were very aggressive in attacking your food. I'm surprised that no one's been stung yet.  Well, it was a desperate attempt to reconnect with California food, but in reality I just need to fly back for a visit. They do have some Cali table wine, which is an attempt, but a little unrepresentative of the real availability of California selection.

This is a big deal when you're at the mall and have a 1 and 3 YO going crazy. Well, they start out at crazy and it just goes crazier from there. I enjoy their salads. Yes, I said it - I don't go here for the pizza. My wife does, she loves their simple mozzarella, tomato, and basil pies. But for me, I'll get a half-sized portion of their Thai Crunch salad. If we're feeling extra hungry we'll get an order of their pita and hummus too. The hummus is OK, but the pita itself always tastes good. I like that they always have flavored ice teas - just be sure not to have them made with sweet tea - the flavoring has sugar as well, so go easy on the stuff, esp if you have a dentist appt in the next 3 months.

Their pizzas are okay -- some of them are a little bit much for me, but I really like the CPK Club pizza. They put ranch on it, along with bacon and chicken and tomatoes and after it's baked, they top it with lettuce and avocado that's already been dressed (so kind of like a salad on a pizza) and it's delicious. Their pastas are okay, I liked the sauce for their chicken tequila pasta (it's a little tangy and not as rich) but there could have been more chicken and I wasn't a huge fan of the bell peppers and the onions in the dish.

The presentation was great, though. We also had the Hawaiian pizza - came out quick, the dough crispy, and it was not salty or greasy as other pizzas are.

15,Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,121,204.0,3.0,2016-05-21,"CPK is always a fine choice when at the mall. It's usually a little less crowded than Cheesecake Factory so it's nice not to have a long wait. I came here for lunch today and it was good. Service was quick and waitress made plenty of stops at our table to ask how we were doing. I ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad. I chose to add avocado to it, since avocado always makes the salad better! I'm unsure why the avocado isn't already just included in this salad though, because they really don't give you that much avocado for an extra charge. I ordered the half size, which I would highly suggest. I always can hardly finish the half size, so I'm unsure how big a whole salad would really be. The salad was super fresh. Ask for the dressing on the side like I did so it's not smothered with so much dressing and BBQ sauce.  Satisfying choice for dining at the mall. Reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

We ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza, which had hardly any chicken the first time we went. The second time, we asked for enough chicken to go around the pizza, so they uncharged us for asking for the norm!?! I guarantee you there won't be a 3rd time. Also, I call the customer support line and the person took my information, and said someone would call me back. But no one called me back.  There are definitely enough restaurant at the South Point Mall.

I ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with serranos, and my wife ordered the carne asada pizza.

Apparently they ran out of bread, RAN OUT. I don't know how I successful business can let this happen. We were sad because we come here for a good meal and bread. Anyway-our food took forever to get here and most of it was cold. Also took forever for us to get the checks. We were definitely not top priority. Waiting here for my check to come, I have so much time on my hands I figured I'd write a review.

0,Geetha V.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,1,,5.0,2017-09-10,"A few of us visited CPK on Saturday (September 9, 2017), and had a great experience. We ordered a mix of Pizza, Soup, Fettucine and Salad. The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. It was a very hectic evening and the staff seemed to be very busy. There was a bit of wait to get a table and get the food as well. But the staff were very kind. I want to specifically mention MATT who was the waiter at our table. He kept a pleasant attitude while taking care of our complex order. When there was some problem with the computer while billing, the manager came and apologized to us. It took them a while to sort out the billing but they decided to not charge us for the order and even gave us a gift card.

1,Mj R.,"Raleigh, NC",3,32,34.0,3.0,2017-12-14,"Vegetarian: I had the crispy Mac n Cheese for an appetizer and it could have been more flavorful. I had the Five Cheese + Fresh Tomato Pizza. I expected more flavor  from a pizza restaurant. My choice was pretty basic and I would return to try one of their other vegetarian options, they have plenty. Vegan: This is not Mellow Mushroom, so there are no vegan pizzas. However, there were several vegan appetizers, and salads.  Gluten-Free: They advertise 4 gluten-free pizzas on their online menu Allergens: The website says to ask a manager about allergies but there isn't an abundance of nuts on the menu.  Service: I came here with my dog and we ate outside. The waiter was very sweet to my puppy and even brought her water without me having to ask. The food came quickly and service was excellent. Recommendations:  There is a blurb to ask a managers about special dietary needs and I can tell they make a conscious effort to be inclusive. I can recommend this restaurant with confidence to other vegetarians and those with gluten-intolerance  but I hesitate to recommend this restaurant to vegans and others with specialized diets. Call ahead, and see what they say. I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
