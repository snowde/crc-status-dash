333,Ayda C.,"Oakland, CA",1,78,54.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"We walked in with a party of 7, the hostess tells us it'll be 30 minutes. The place is cramped so we decide to shop at h&m until the table is ready.  One of our friend arrives late to CPK and the hostess claims that she can't hold the table any longer if we don't come back in 5 minutes? She told us 30 and only 10 minutes had gone by. She should have gave us a better time estimate because she rushed us to shop and pay.  Nonetheless, we were seated. The waiter was nice. But then CPK ran out of bread? Okay, how do you run out of bread? Whatever.  I think CPK should just serve bread with the pasta dishes just because the portions are so small and cost so much.  I had the Jambalaya pasta and a strawberry lemonade. It was good but not bomb. Seemed like something not worth $15.50+$3.00.  No one in our party was full...the bill came up to $121 for the seven of us, not bad. But totally not worth it.  I'm only giving 3 stars because the waiter was nice and he cleaned up when I spilled my strawberry lemonade as I left. Also, in giving 3 stars because food was good but not satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=380,3.4,3.2,3.2,2.444,3.2800000000000007
193,Shirleyanne A.,"Boston, MA",275,268,238.0,3.0,2012-01-06,"My boss ordered the catering service. They give you 10 pizzas (any flavor from their regular pizza menu), 2 salads (bbq chopped salad, caesar or mixed greens) and a tray of cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin & snickerdooodle). My coworker said the snickerdoodle was too sweet. The Works pizza is just your standard combo pizza. Everybody liked the Thai Chicken and Chipotle Chicken pizzas. The White Pizza was quite salty. I'm glad we didn't add bacon to it because it probably would have made it even saltier. We were pretty bummed that the Garlic Chicken was discontinued.  That was their best flavor! Don't get me wrong. Their pizzas were pretty good. I ate 5 slices (which means I have to punish myself with a 7 mile run tonight). But my standards for pizza were set high by Tony's Pizza and I am still in love with Round Table (I have no clue why I'm crazy about the Round Table crust and sauce).  We had problems with their online ordering system and it was too slow.  I know for a fact it wasn't due to our connection because I tested a different website to see if it loaded slow. The ordering system didn't even send me a confirmation so we decided to call it in just to be sure.  The CPK employee said they never got our online order. Aside from those minuses, the customer service was great. They packed our big order neatly. They kept the cold salad goods away from the hot pizzas so that the salad won't wilt. They even kept the chicken separate from the Caesar salad because the chicken was hot. They also kept the dressings in these nice squeeze containers that you can reuse for your own condiments. The guy who took our order was courteous and reassuring. Their customer service definitely surpassed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=200,3.32,3.22,3.22,2.476,3.2600000000000007

We were seated quickly and they brought us the menu(the waitress said it was new menus) and water quickly. After about 10 minutes we ordered the bbq chicken pizza, The works and grilled chicken caesar salad sandwich on the herbed onion focaccia. Bbq chicken pizza:  it was about 13 inchs in diameter and had cubes of grilled chicken and red oinon on top with bbq sauce under the layer of mozarella cheese. I admit it was pretty good because it was fresh and not too drench in sauce. What my problem was is that for some reason some parts of my pizza were cold compare to the rest of my melting cheesy gooey hot pizza. The Works: The works was the combination pizza. it had mozzarella cheese pepperoni, sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and onion. It was flavorful with the thin layer of tomato sauce. Not too much oily either. The Grilled Chicken Caesar sandwich: the grilled chicken on this sandwich was delicious but not much seasoning. it had a thin layer of mayo and tomato and ice berg lettuce all in between the herb onion focaccia bread. The bread was lightly toasted and served with soup. I ordered the tortilla soup. It was very thick and creamy but not very good. The bread of the sandwich seemed a bit doughy for me too. Pumpkin Cheesecake: The cheesecake came in a really big slice and not bad as for as taste. It was very pumpkin pie tasting with the cream cheese mixed into it. My friends enjoyed it and so did i. Service was good. Our server was super busy and actually had to switch off to different server. Also we have to ask for bread instead of them just serving it to us.

I ordered the California Club Pizza, which came with fresh bacon, chicken, tomatoes, and greens covered in mayo. It was like eating a salad on the pizza, but way better.

Last weekend I went with my girlfirend and her two sisters for a dinner and ended up waiting half an hour, while it rained. We decided to while we got our remote. I guess that's one solace for the waiting parties in the Bay Street mall, you can go shop. We planned our orders since we had so much time to think. We ordered two pastas, two pizzas, and a salad. I ordered the Jambalaya, which was a favorite on their menu. It was noted with a little palm tree next to item. I originally wanted to try the chimichurri chicken dish, but asked the waiter what that was. His response was, ""chimichurri is with chimichurri sauce"". I asked him to elaborate. He said, ""it's sort of green"". As you can tell, I didn't go for it. I thought he would try to explain the flavor or ingredients involved. I did not want to get smart with him on a rainy day. Plus I love jambalaya. The pizzas came, then the pastas, and lastly the salad. What a reversal of events.  There's nothing special about the food here, except it's not bad. I would come here if I was lazy for weekend. They used to have korean style tacos here, but I no longer see it on the menu.

317,Suzette N.,"Oakland, CA",2,17,,5.0,2012-07-16,"This review starts off pretty bad but you have to get to the bottom to know why I gave them 5 stars: There were quite a few issues with the food when it was brought out to our table on Friday, 29JUN12, if it was brought out to the table at all. The crispy mac 'n' cheese starters came out at room temperature, which left a lot to be desired. The pizza we ordered inadvertently made its way to another guest's table, while the cedar plank salmon came out very well done, more than any salmon connoisseur would appreciate. When this was brought to the attention of our server (her name escapes my mind) the young lady immediately informed the manager, Mr. Waylen Williams, and he quickly approached our table. Mr. Williams was extremely apologetic and very sincere in his acknowledgement of all of our concerns, specifically the unacceptability of the food as it both had and had not been presented to us. Mr. Williams immediately attempted to rectify the situation. Not only did Mr. Williams follow-up on the missing food item and overcooked salmon but when he returned to our table Mr. Williams agreed to comp the entire dinner (my food had arrived to the table flawlessly) while also offering us the opportunity to return to CPK for a free dinner. The latter was totally unexpected but very much appreciated and showed us that Mr. Williams was generally concerned with making sure CPK remained one of our favorite eateries, minus this unfortunate occurrence. Not only is Mr. Williams proficient in customer service but he gets kudos for customer retention! Eating out is something that we do often and customer service is extremely important in defining the dining experience. With all the issues that were experienced that evening, all that negativity was overshadowed by Mr. Williams' professional demeanor and his heartfelt apologies for our unfortunate experiences that particular evening.

I ordered the margherita pizza and, while it was the size of a medium sized plate, it really was just enough for one person, perhaps two if you're both not feeling too hungry. The pizza was really good, with a very thin crust that was crispy at the edges, but I was hoping it would've have whole tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce, cheese, and basil. Really the only thing that made it a ""margherita"" was the basil. Prices are a bit much, considering the size of the pizzas (almost $13 for essentially a personal pizza), but I guess you can feel ok about it, considering the fact that the pizza is tasty...  The menu is pretty extensive here. There are many different ""artisan"" pizzas here (that description always makes me laugh a little), salads, pastas, and starters, so there's more than likely going to be something for everyone. Someone in a another review said this is a good place to come if you're not in a hurry - he's right. Considering that we had five different pizzas coming to our table, I don't really blame the wait, and it was great that they brought out everything at the same time, but yeah, it's going to be a bit of a wait for your food here. Our waitress was also pretty much MIA the entire meal. Not that we needed her to come around, but it's always nice to know your table hasn't been forgotten. We also had to sit and wait for a while after we'd eaten, for her to come around and ask if we were finished. I will give her a lot of credit for being pretty cool at the end - we wanted to split the bill five ways (yeah, we were that annoying group in the restaurant that day that has to pull some complicated crap), but she did it for us with a great attitude.

That said, I have eaten at two CPK locations within the past 30 days. First at the Fashion Mall in Las Vegas, right before heading out to the airport to catch the homeward-bound flight and today at the Bay Street location. For a chain, CPK at Bay Street shall put some of the local restaurants in shame. Despite a bit of a confusion at seating, we received wonderful service the minute we walked into the restaurant. Until recently, I was in a deception that CPK only served pizzas. I avoided going because I'm gluten-free. Obviously CPK is way more than just pizzas. We had: Chicken lettuce wrap BBQ Chicken Pizza Waldorf Salad (half portion) The chicken lettuce wrap with ginger soy sauce is delicious. It might not taste like the ones I had at home but good enough. A welcoming alternative to the usual spinach artichoke dip if you like Asian-fusion. My bf had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, one of their hand-tossed pizzas and was tasty, with plenty of basil. My Waldorf Salad has generous portion of candied walnuts and apples. Chicken is grilled but not dry, and the mustard vinaigrette is perfectly flavored. The bartender nailed the Grey Goose cosmopolitan. They key is fresh lime. It came in a 6-oz martini glass, pink, and with pulps---all that I look for in a great cosmo. For $10.50 this cosmo rocks. Service is friendly and efficient. Food is above average for chain.

CPK is a restaurant that my boyfriend and I go to every once in a while so I didn't expect tonight to be any different from our previous experiences but I was so wrong. From the start the service was terrible. We told the host how many was in our party and we knew we would have to wait. We decided to have drink at the bar until our name was called. 30 minutes later we noticed that people who came in were getting seated before us. When my bf asked how much longer the wait was, the hostess stated ""you're getting there."" So we pointed out that people were getting seated and they were able to find a table right then and there. Where we were seated there were PLENTY of small tables that we could have sat down to in the same station.  When we got seated our waitress took our order and offered us bread. WE NEVER GOT BREAD. WE NEVER GOT WATER. When our food came out the runner didn't offer us any cheese or pepper or any other condiments. Our waitress never came to check on our order or us even though she walked by our table and saw me looking at her. The pasta was finished before the water came. She FINALLY came with water as my boyfriend went to look for the manager. I pointed out all the inefficiencies and she simply shrugged her shoulders and said ""Sorry.""

Either our waiter forgets our bread, we're seated much later than the expected wait time, or our food just does not come out for a long time. Unfortunately, I love this place because the food is always yummy (my all time favorites are the roasted vegetable salad and the wild mushroom pizza).  However, no matter how busy or NOT busy this place is, typically something goes wrong. For example, during my visit yesterday I put my name on the list to be seated and was told it would be 10-15 minutes from the young lady upfront. I went to use the restroom while my friend waited near the front. When I come back, I see two other parties being seated before me (both parties of 2) who had come in right after we put our name down. I assumed maybe they had already come in earlier but were checking back in. Then after about 5 more minutes the same lady asks me if I had put my name down...I was so upset! Not only did she forget who we were after literally 10 minutes, but she claims that she already called my name. While I was in the bathroom, if she calls my name like she claims she should've asked around with the parties already waiting in the area instead of just moving on. Furthermore, does she think I'm just sitting around for no reason in a restaurant? NO! I put my name down and if your waitresses are incompetent to the point that they can't remember someone's face from 10 minutes ago, that's an issue. And it wasn't even crowded...that's not even the end of it though. After she apologizes and seats us, our server doesn't come over for 15 minutes. I have to call two separate waiters after finally our real server comes to our table. Turns out the lady who seated us from the front didn't think to tell our server that she had seated a table that he had to serve...seriously? Service after that point was breezy.

For example, the California club pizza has avocado, arugula, and bacon loaded onto a pizza crust. It looks like a salad on top of a pizza. Not super-flavorful, but you feel good about getting your daily veggie intake, and on your pizza no less.  And can I say, their kids menu here is superb? $5.50 for their version of Mac n cheese, which came on a large plate and had the option of adding edamame for .50. Unlike fancy restaurants which often serve kids Mac n cheese from a box, CPK gives you a meal that was actually made from non-powdered ingredients. Nice.  They even have a salad option for kids. I don't know many toddlers who will eat salad, but it's a nice gesture. At least they're consistent throughout the menu in terms of infusing ""California healthy"" ingredients into all their dishes.  The bill ended up being $72 after tax and tip for 1 appetizer, pizza, salad, pasta, and kid's Mac n cheese. Fed three adults and one toddler.

We got the chicken quesadilla the sauce for it was really good and had a kick to it.

But we ended up ordering half a thai crunch, California club pizza, and two unlimited refills of flavored iced tea.  The salad was delicious as usual, there is so many components to the salad that it is hard to recreate, making it worth trying at CPK. The pizza was fresh and good it was kinda hard to eat at first because most of the stuff kept coming out but we eventually got the hang of it. The Iced teas was sweetened and had distinct flavors of mango and raspberry. The peach one was kinda diluted for my taste but still delicious compared to starbucks' overpriced iced tazo teas.

He cleaned the table and re-set those plates on the table for the next guests to use. Now, I've been in the hospitality business since i was a teenager and the #1 rule is that if a dish touches a table, no matter if it's been used or not, you take it back to the kitchen to get washed. It doesn't matter if it even looks clean or looks like nothing got on it, you still have to remove all dishes from the table to go get washed and sanitized. I was seriously grossed out, especially when a family of 3 came right in and sat down at that table. I sure hope they didn't end up needing to use those plates!!!!

All in all, a great lunch date. Let me start with our waiter, Eric. He was in a great mood. He was patient and attentive. He also didn't roll his eyes at complicated orders or a lot of questions. My son has severe, life threatening, food allergies. And not just one, so eating out can be very stressful for my family. Eric made sure to listen to my concerns and had no problem answering questions and double checking ingredients. All the while smiling and keeping the mood light and happy. The kitchen staff messed up my son's order and Eric caught it before it even got to the table. Meanwhile mine and my Fiancè's food came out on time and cooked deliciously. He had the jumbalaya pasta, it was amazing! He is a hard sell and he loved it from bite 1. I had the tostada pizza, also done to perfection. Eric made sure to bring my son's side dishes out so he wouldn't have to wait any longer to eat. A true delight to have a waiter that is really good at what he does. So to recap,  Eric, our waiter, was outstanding! The food was really well made and cooked perfectly! The only downfall was the mess up in the kitchen. I dropped a star because, we specifically ordered for my son as soon and Eric came to the table because he was really hungry and he ended up getting his food after us. My understand is, that was due to the kitchen staff. That being said, they can cook!! One last thing, they have some new drinks on the menu... I had the Strawberry Basil Martini.

Last weekend we went there for dinner with my husband. No smile at the frontdesk but lots of smiles from our waitress D.. Good food as usual, though the service was a little slow. My husband finished his glass of water with his entree and never got it refilled... You will never get more than a 15% tip with him if you don't refill his water. That's sort of a basic service thing... I ordered a strawberry colada which had the consistency of  a smoothie, and that is fine, but then you should provide your customers with a larger straw because it was really difficult to drink that with the tiny regular straw. It was sort of difficult to get the attention of our waitress. She was smiley when with us but she never came to check in on our food and was taking a lot of time between each course. The reason for my update is not the straw though, or even the slow service. It is the bill. When it came it said $38 and I put my card in. The waitress came back and I was ready to write in the tip when my husband notices that there was a mistake: it was now saying the bill was $33. Even if the service was so-and-so that night, I did not want to rob you guys, so I told the waitress that it was not the right amount as it should be more. She took it, talked about it with a man who seemed to be a manager and brought the check back at $38 and said ""sorry about that"". I was quite surprised that she said SORRY and not ""THANK YOU for your honesty"". Seriously, I doubt half of your customers would have let the waitress know about the mistake being in their advantage.

It's good quality and ""handsome"" but without edge.  It's middle of the road pizza that could be great pizza.  I imagine that the early California Pizza Kitchens had outstanding food. ...Before it went corporate and those masterpiece pizzas became ""pizza by the numbers"" ersatz products.   Unless you've just awoken from a coma and would eat your blue hospital booties and cannot get to Zachary's (for the Caesars salad, if nothing else) you will not have an inspirational pizza at (this) California Pizza Kitchen.   For pizza lovers (like BBQ, bagels and lovers of ethnic foods) searching for the real deal,  more than three stars would mean this is not worth your while.   My commendation here is for Eric/Erik, our server who was, actually, exceptional.

The location itself is beautiful especially at night with the accent lighting and vibes. My family and I had driven yesterday evening from LA, so we were looking forward to sitting down and having a nice meal; of course, we went with cpk because it's always good.  The hosts were kind and accommodating. But our waitress was something else. I understand the stresses of being a waitress because I have been one before, especially with a full house and a million things to do at once. This girl was clearly distracted the whole time. We ordered our peach ice teas- served warm and with a faint sweetness. I needed to flag the waitress's down to get refills.  On one occasion I kept looking for her and she was sitting outside ""cleaning"" the little drink booklets while she  looked around and went on to text on her phone (she even stared back at me while I was looking at her and that didn't give her the hint that I might have needed something). I have to clarify my family and myself are not arrogant by any means, we are polite and never treat waiters unfairly, however  I was beyond frustrated with her service.  The bolognese pasta lacked flavor from the usual times we had ordered this before. The caesar salad lacked dressing and you could tell wasn't mixed properly. Usually waiters offer crushed pepper over your salad and none was offered. Near the end,  I asked for a dessert and the bill.  About 15 minutes later she hands me the bill and I asked her if the dessert was coming and she said ""oh yeah I leave that until the end"". Finally she places it on the table, clearly over her day, and walks away without a word.

I they review the tapes of the incident they will see an unknown lady coming from outside and giving the same tall manager a cake or something to keep in their cld storage as a favor. Highly irregular n my opinion. Opens up the place to charges of favoritism and contamination. I now think the ushers/manager just favor friends and give them your seats as you wait unaware. T   We really go to CPK often. But this location is the worst American chain restaurant we have ever seen. Most of the staff is from Oakland area and are very rude and clearly untrustworthy. Watch your food. We were sitting less than 5 feet away waiting eagerly for our name to be called and I discovered they had scratched it off already. When I asked, the black lady casually implied that it was somehow my fault because  someone ""claimed your name and we seated them"".  I asked ""if you had called our names out clearly, how could we miss it from 5 feet away if not less?"" No reply and worse: she offered no solution either, like ""sorry let me find you a table next""...The manager, the only white guy seemed nice, and seated us. But the staff seemed to now want to teach us a lesson and the drinks refused to show up despite reminders, for over 30 minutes. After I spoke to the manager (again) and said this is our second bad experience at this very location in a month and I will leave, he simply said ""Well. in that case have a nice day"" and turned to his computer screen again.

I am surprised CPK management does not reach out to disappointed customers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We have been visiting this establishment for years now. Maybe two to three times a year. I could take it or leave it since their beer selection on tap is always mediocre but the wife loves the jambalaya so I take here there when I can and we usually spend 60 to 80 bucks plus tip depending if one of the kids join us. Service is always decent and the youthful staff generally pleasant.  Unfortunately today we were seated up against a desk where the wait staff conducts business near the back end of the restaurant. Two of the employees got into a long lasting conversation that I tried to ignore but with their animated voices coming in one ear I couldn't hear what my wife was saying across the table from me. I did go there to enjoy a meal with my wife after all.  After some minutes of frustration finally asked my wife that I was struggling to hear to hold her thought while I turned and ask the two employees to please tone it down and said that that was not the place to hold a private conversation.  The first employee looked surprised as if she didn't realize the volume of their voices and kindly appoligised. The second, believe her name was Simone, copped an Excuuse Me!?!!  attitude. I told her ""if I am out of line please call the manager""  I didn't go there to be a problem, just wanted to eat lunch with the wife after a movie. She went on and on for several minutes behind my back after that telling another employer among other things that she would in fact call the manager. What a meal ruiner.  Finally my wife asked our great waitress for the manager. He came over and said ""I will take care of it and some other very nice words about how we are the reason the business is there but the date was ruined.

We went on Halloween and it was about a 10-15 min wait as expected. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant around 6:20 . We waited about another 10-15 min until our waitress, Misty came and greeted us. As she came up she seemed a little flustered like she's been running around, as seen. Right there on the spot she asked if we were ready to order and so we did. 20mins has passed we didn't receive our drinks another couple that was seated shortly after us ended up leaving. Another 10mins pass, she comes up to us asking if we've seen a $100 bill and she didn't even explain, or apologize why she hasn't brought our drinks until we said something. She apologized like she didn't know what was going on.  5 mins later she brings out our water and bread. It was past 7 and finally received our food while other people around us who were seated after got their food before us. As she brought our entrees out I was wondering why we didn't receive out appetizers first. I mean it is called an appetizer for a reason. As she brought out entrees out she apologized and wondered why our appetizer didn't come out, I was wondering the same thing. At this point my boyfriend and I were irritated after waiting quite some time and we were in such a time crunch(we were going to watch a movie). I got the creamy garlic pasta w chicken for the most part it does not own up to its name, it was not creamy what so ever. My boyfriend got the bbq chicken pizza and it was so and so. While we were eating Misty came and checked on us and saw that we had drinken all our water and asked if we wanted more and I said yes. 10 mins pass, no water and she comes and checks up on us after we finished out food and asked if we wanted more water and I was just so frustrated at this point where I just wanted the check and to leave.

They closed the one in SF on Van Ness Avenue, which wasn't too far from my job in the Civic Center area. It was one of my regular spots for lunch two/three times a month. It wasn't that much of the pizzas or pasta dishes that had me returning to dine at CPK. It was the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup - truly a hearty split pea soup, a good one at that to warm me up during the cold, nippy days. A cup of this soup was never enough for me, but a bowl...yes with sliced sourdough French bread...nom nom nom. Forget Campbell's canned split pea soup with ham. That canned soup ain't got nothing on the CPK's split pea soup...lol. CPK serves not only pizzas (original hand-tossed crust or crispy thin crust) but also appetizers; two different soups; salads; small plates; pastas; sandwiches; specialty items; tacos (carnitas or fish) desserts; assorted flavored iced teas, lemonades, and hot/cold beverages. They even have a children's menu. I don't dine at this CPK too often for lunch. This is my fourth time dining here in a span of 5 to 6 years. I have never experienced, encountered or received any bad and/or rude customer service from the hostess at the front area, wait staff or manager.  Today was no exception to the cordial and friendly service that my mom and family received from the employees. They were accommodating, attentive and helpful. Even the manager pitched in and made sure we were content.  Eats: Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup; 1/2 orders of California Cobb Salad, Caramelized Peach Salad, Moroccan Chicken Salad; Fish tacos and Jamaican Jerk Chicken for five people. As usual, the soup is still a hit. My sisters, mom and husband all had a taste of the soup - they're hooked. Definitely there will be returned visits for my favorite soup and a piece of key lime pie or salted caramel pudding for dessert.

You are ushered to a table promptly, and notice that the restaurant is only about 25% occupied.  Should I eat here?  Unfortunately, you do.   Once your final server arrives, she asks if you got menus, you say 'no' and she replies, ""Great, what can I get for you.""  You look at your dinner companion thinking, 'Did she hear me?""  and you shout over the music, ""We didn't get menus"".  She finally understands and points to menus on the table next to us saying, ""There are menus over here, were you supposed to sit here, do you want to sit here?""  We assure our server that we are pleased with where we are sitting.  We also have to remind her that we didn't get menus, so we aren't ready to order yet.  Should we eat here?  Unfortunately, we do. We ask for club soda from the bar, the 'free' stuff.  She nods smiling, ""Sure, do you want lemon or lime with that?"".  We order an entree, and as soon as the words leave our lips, she slams her pad shut and almost walks away.  ""Wait"", we say, ""We would also like to order a salad"".  She takes our complete order quickly and goes away.  It is not too late, should we eat here?  Unfortunately, we do.   Our salad arrives, and I take my first bite.  ""Hmmm?""  My dinner companion seems to enjoy it, but I taste something strange.  We narrow it down to the sun dried tomatoes.  They taste off.  This is noticeable especially because we have ordered this salad (Sun Dried Tomato and Asparagus) many times before and always enjoy it...except for today.  With that initial sewage smell still fresh in our minds, we decide to send the salad back.   Our BBQ chicken pizza arrives, the flavor is good.  We eat the whole thing. Our bill arrives and we notice our two club sodas were listed at $3.25 each.   ""Excuse me"" we ask the server, ""I think there has been a mistake"".  She looks at our bill, ""No, we charge for club soda, that's our policy"".  We reminded her about the 'free' stuff and she completely disregards those words were spoken.  Staring at us blankly, she insists that we must pay for the two club sodas that were squirted into a cup from the bar.   We ask for the manager, and she fixes the problem.  She does not fix this bad experience.

Lucky for us we got there right before the lunch wave hit and was seated within 5-10 minutes.  Coming with a party of 5, they seated us in the standard 4 party table so it was quite cozy by the time all the food came out. The initial greeting was prompt and they took down our orders pretty fast. Then the waiting game began as we awaited about 30 minutes before we flagged down a waiter to ask him for house bread with the oil/herb dip. It took another 5-10 minutes before our food arrived. I get it they're super busy.  We ordered: - The original BBQ chicken pizza $15.49: though this was their signature dish it was overall just alright. The chicken was cooked well and the BBQ sauce wasn't too overpowering, but it isn't something I would crave. 3* - California Cobb Salad $16.49: pretty standard salad with the standard Cobb contents. I would definitely recommend doing dressing on the side so it's not overpowered. 3* - Sicilian thin crust pizza $16.99: my favorite of the pizzas. Good variety of meats, I enjoyed the thin crust and overall tasty, but not $17 tasty. 4* - Waldorf salad $16.29: the better of the two salads. I loved the combination of spinach, cheese, grapes, and candied walnuts. It was delicious! 4.5*  - California club pizza $16.49: very healthy, fresh ingredients, but a bit pricy for the portion size. 4* Overall, good pizza, but for the price and service I don't think I will frequent this place as much especially with better quality and value pizza shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville,2.92,2.93,2.948,2.508,2.926

The unfortunate part of is that we sat there for a good 15 minutes waiting for someone to at least greet us but no one came. The first 5 minutes I was trying to be lenient just because I've worked in the restaurant business and saw that it was picking up so I just waited a bit but when the tummy hungry, the patience is hungry too so after being neglecting and looking around for someone to help us, I got up and walked up to the host stand and asked if they could send someone our way because of the fact we were sitting for 15 minutes with no service, not even a hello. So after 5 minutes, one of the hosts apologized for the inconvenience and then two staff members, one I believe to be a manager and another to be our actual server approached us and the manager goes ""have you guys been helped yet?"" and I replied ""no not yet"" and they both decided to contemplate on who was going to help us and so the server ended up taking care of us. We ordered everything, a coke, raspberry ice tea, and strawberry mango cooler for drinks and then the mushroom and spinach flatbread, Caesar salad with chicken, and a spicy chipotle chicken pizza. After waiting, our server forgot what I ordered because I noticed her not writing everything down. But again unfortunately food took about 30 minutes to come out. Luckily the food there is always good and that is why I will always come. The Chipotle pizza definitely reminded me of actual chipotle so that was good.

I used to always get this pan-fried salmon dish with a delicious pasta and capers dish. It was mouth-watering and I was looking forward to enjoying it again after all these years. CPK closed in my hometown. Sad sad day. I guess I didn't eat there enough even if I was there practically every other week. Oh well, such is life. I settled on the ribeye.  The Fire-grilled Ribeye was served on a cutting board which I found to be a very unique and interesting presentation. I'm pleased to say that it worked well. The steak didn't move around the plate as I cut into it and the juices flowed into the reservoir outlining the board. I requested it medium as I always order my steaks. It was blackened and seasoned well. Very tasty. It came with Yukon potato fingerlings. They crispy and seasoned with sea salt and very good as well.

There were about 2 hostess, both young ladies who both seemed to be uninterested in the guest, we requested to sit outside because there was seating available and it was a lovely day, she ignored us proceeded to talk to her coworker about taking a break and sat us in the back by the kitchen door.... which honestly is just a shitty seat to sit anyone especially when you want to have a conversation because there's so much traffic.

Anyways, I tried to order my lettuce cups I had it in my head that's what I was eating my I did want it done a special way, no water chestnuts, since I usually dine @ CPK and they make this happen for me I was expecting it here but apparently they can't make it that way, and my server was honest enough to let me know it wouldn't be worth it because half of the mix is water chestnuts, since I use to be a sauté chef, I completely understood kitchen prep for an item like this, so I wasn't upset I just found something else, still bummed out though.  So we ordered a mushroom flatbread, and 2 half size Cobb salads, all the food was good the only issue was it came out at different times so we weren't able to eat together & that kinda defeats the purpose of having lunch.

19,Ken S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,32,6.0,4.0,2017-08-16,"Placed a to-go order over the phone, in which the order taker was very polite, and very kind. Then when I got there I had to stand awkwardly at the to-go counter until somebody felt like helping me. It looks like they don't actually have someone who's in charge of to-go orders, who ever handles it is probably just whoever happens to be available when there's someone standing there. Not a very good way to handle business.  But, the food is why I didn't give this place 3 stars. The food is top-notch; best pizza I've ever had. And the bread/oil they give with it is killer as well. It's just a shame about the service regarding to-go orders, or I'd give 5 stars no doubt. I'd still recommend though, no doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20,2.92,2.88,2.88,,2.896

I appreciate it so much to see the company notices bad reviews and tries to fix it!  That's the reason why I would give the company marketing team some good scores!  I went again to this same spot using my new gift card seeing if the service got better; it wasn't as bad as last time that's for sure! Pet friendly was nice as well but the servers could bring the food out faster when the food is ready, my pasta was cold in the center of the plate of food.

But, then she tries to give me a sorry excuse as to why it was taking so long. I literally watched her bring bread to other people in the restaurant. They could have the best pizza in the world and I would still be ticked off for having such poor service at the beginning of a meal.  Great Service has to be from the start of a meal to the end. It can't be halfway. You can't just have great food to carry your restaurant.

129,Just M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2017-11-02,"I will NEVER eat at this filthy establishment again. When We first day down, we had to have the server wow the tables down with a CLEAN rag because clearly, it was previously cleaned with a dirty rag and the table smells like piss (we were nowhere near the restrooms). They served us disgusting non-alcoholic beverages that consisted of nothing but flavored syrup. We returned those.  Then, they served my 9 year old son a man & cheese dish that had both a piece of cardboard AND moldy cheese in it!! Later that night, the food that was already consumed made my pregnant friend and I violently ill. I spoke a manager, Frederico  the next day who promised me a refund for the remainder of the bill (the two meals that made my friend & I sick). Almost a week later,  I inquired AGAIN. Frederico advised out would come the next day. Three days later STILL nothing,  and another manager, Porfirio, tells me that he can't call Corporate because Frederico isn't in!  Huh?? They have the SAME TITLE. He says to call back tomorrow when Frederico is there or when Carol the GM is in. I surely will AND will be phoning corporate myself. Only eat here if you wan't dirty tables, contaminated food, and HORRIBLE customer service!

I will def be trying this again the next time I come here. Also the sangria is delicious. Tip: when you come here sign up for the CPK rewards. When you spend $100 you get a free entree.

I truly enjoyed the tortilla wraps but am dinging a star because my GF ordered a cup of the nachos soup (which in fact tasted like 7-11 nachos) and I ordered a bowl of the potato soup, yet the cup is a bigger serving for 2 bucks less... not something your customers should know in my opinion but I'm outing cpk for the ripoff I thought the fried mac n cheese balls were totally awesome.

The items were delicious, don't get me wrong, but my husband's pizza was the smallest I've ever seen, and he ate his cup of soup in about 60 seconds.

I've ordered here twice in 2017 and the first time they messed up on my invoice. Ended up messing up the final billing which took almost 2 weeks to fix. The last time I ordered was in the beginning of December. The sandwiches were not up to par and forgot the grilled veggies for one of the salads. The sandwiches were pretty sad. Seemed like they ran out of bread and had to substitute. They were cut into halves but seemed like the sandwiches were cut into 1/4's which made one of the sandwiches barely without meat.  Lastly the person who delivered our order admitted to me he was a busboy and that the CPK did not have enough delivery folks.
