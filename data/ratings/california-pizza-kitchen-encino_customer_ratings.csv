175,Ellie S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2012-01-22,I been  at this place before and  it was great.  It is  located in a shopping center and  they had a vallet  parking  or at least it was possible to park. Today  we  got in the parking structure and  when  I told  we going to  CPK the reply  was park yourself. Yet all availible  parking spaces had orange cones on it so we were not allowed to  use it. We left  the  place and  from the street it was visible CPK  was almost empty. It seems the parking situation  drives away customers. If it wil not change  few will ever  go there for sure I am not going to try again.  If  customers feel not welcome  they  will find places where they are.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=160,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

Service here is great and servers are very attentive especially during the lunch hours. They have everything from soups, pizzas, sandwiches, to pastas. I personally like the bbq chop salad or the chicken pesto flatbread.  On hot summer days I like to sit outside under the umbrellas, enjoy my lunch and watch the busy street of Ventura.  This CPK is located on the 2nd floor in the Encino place.

69,Jessica H.,"San Dimas, CA",22,105,,2.0,2012-03-13,"This CPK needs a little help.... By that I mean they seem a little ""frazzled"" by the lunch time rush.  We got seated pretty quickly and the hostess validated our parking fast, but it took probably 10 minutes before our drink and food order were taken.  Also, it took our food forever to come out.  Our waiter did at least bring us some bread to eat in the mean time and kept our drinks refilled, but it didn't seem like the kitchen had it together to keep the food coming out at a steady pace. Once we got our food the quality was perfect.  Every time I come here it seems like there is new staff or new management.  Hopefully they will get it together soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=120,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.536,3.2000000000000006

Last time we went we sat on the patio and waited 20 min to place the drink order (I kid you not) :( after we finally got service things were good and food was consistent as always.  The lady who always seats with the short blonde hair is always nice and chipper. Also Mario is great if you get his humor and are not in a rush.

99,Janel V.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,14,,2.0,2012-05-29,"I give this place two stars because while the food & busboy were awesome,  the service was deplorable!! My co-worker & I (who both work in a restaurant) had worked up quite the appetite due to shopping for about 5 hours.  We decided to go to CPK because she really likes it & it was close by.  When we arrived the host was friendly enough, and sat us down and told us our server would be with us shortly. Now, as previously stated, I've worked in restaurant in for years & totally understand when it's busy and it may take you awhile to get to the table.  It was actually a pretty mellow night, and we were in a chill mood, so we sat looking over the menu and waiting for someone to take our drink order.  And waited.....and waited....and waited.  I honestly hate giving bad reviews because I can relate to having a bad day or being swamped.  But when you have all that extra help, seems a little odd it would take that long.  Once our food order was in, that came out really fast and was amazing.  Try the roasted peach salad, it is so freaking good!!! I want to make it clear that the server wasn't rude, just  inattentive and not very friendly.  We saw her once the whole time we ate...that's with an appetizer, salad & our entrees that we had to get through.  Didn't drop our food, didn't check to see if we were ok.  She actually walked past us and didn't even give us a second look.  On the other hand, the busser was amazing.  Friendly as could be, helpful and got us refills. &  bread while we waited. Towards the end of our meal, our server came over  to check on us and to box our food up.   Even with not friendly service, I can't help but leave 20% as it's practically ingrained in me to do so.  It was for the busser mainly, but I know he didn't get to keep it :(  Had this place been busier or if they didn't have bussers and food runners to help, then I'd be way more lenient on the service. So, we packed up and then we left, with not a single person said goodby to us...not even our server that we passed on our way out. All in all, great food but lackluster service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.472,3.2400000000000007

Other than that We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and we were not welcomed at all it seemed we were an inconvience. Out of all the places we could have had lunch we chose to eat there and they made me feel very unwelcomed. Are server was not friendly until the end of our meal... You know tip time.

Sure, California Club w/chicken sandwich from Tacos+Sandwiches section, coffee and glass of water.  I'm thankful to her for paying attention and a good service.

Our office orders from this CPK quite a bit. Today I went to pick up an order for four people. It was extremely busy, they were understaffed with servers, and a pile-up had formed at the take-out counter. From order to pick-up, it took over an hour for them to have our food ready. I'm sure no one in line was happy, but no one was being vocal or threatening either.  Nonetheless, when we finally got our order, they just gave it to us for free. That was surprising. I'm used to lame consolation prizes from other restaurants like a free appetizer they were going to throw away anyway as goodwill bribes for poor service. A free meal? That usually takes some grumblin', and there was no grumblin' here. I'd be even more ecstatic if I were saving myself money instead of my office. This place always gets busy around lunch time, though not usually this busy. Slip-ups happen. I get it. A free lunch redeems a lot though.

Our party of four arrived mid-week before any dinner rush. The restaurant was not even half full. However, service was extremely slow. Not sure if they were short-staffed in terms of servers or kitchen staff. There seemed to be many people walking around with headsets - but perhaps they weren't communicating?  We had to change our table as the late afternoon sun was reflecting off a building nearby. It looked like blinds had been removed for some reason (the brackets were still visible). Our drink order came in a fair amount of time. I had iced coffee with cream and sugar - but it came without a spoon to stir. Our server quickly came back with a spoon. We waited longer than we would have liked for our meal. There were no complimentary breads or chips to start. I think this is true of all CPK locations? I noticed other tables waiting for food as well.  When the meals arrived, one of the pasta dishes was not hot. Our server took it back and returned with a new dish (not just re-heated). That was a pleasant surprise.  My fish tacos were a bit skimpy, though the mahi mahi was fine. There could have been some additional sauce on the coleslaw. There really weren't too many people in the restaurant so it seemed like service should have been better. Maybe the kitchen was busy cooking for pick up customers?  Our server, while nice enough, seemed harried. Also, the noise level was quite high and we had to raise our voices a bit to have any conversation.

It took an hour of trying to get someone to help us and teach them basic math before we just gave up and left.

I explained to him what happen and he didn't seem amused. So we get our food, the ravioli was so good and then the white pizza not so good! We changed that for the Sicilian pizza which was better. When we wanted to change the pizza we had to talk to the manager first. He was nice and friendly but I can tell he seemed annoyed that we wanted to change the order. When we asked our waiter for his opinion he had an attitude about it saying ""well my most favorite was crossed out"" just a weird thing to say. So then we get the check and he forgot to take off the coke I had order and when we try to track him down as he was talking to an other waiter but kept looking at us he finally came over and I told him he left the coke oh their still and he respond ""ohhhhhh I diddddd?!""

My daughter order the HABANERO CARNITAS pizza and my son had mac n cheese.  Since we signed up for their Pizza Dough rewards, we received a small plate selection for free.  We chose the CRISPY MAC 'N' CHEESE.  It was really good. When they brought our meal they brought a CARNITAS TACOS plate instead of the Habanero Carnitas pizza. We told them it should be the pizza, and they took it back. Brandon our server came over and apologized for the error.  I told him, its OK.  But you can bring back the tacos if you're just going to throw them away.  We laughed as he brought them back. The tacos looked good and so did the salsa.  WTH? Who would think that carnitas tacos at CPK would really be good.  I will be the first to say, they were awesome! The carnitas, the avocado salsa and the red salsa were incredible.  Wendy (the manager) came over and apologized and ask how we liked the tacos. I told basically what I said before.  I really didn't think they were going to be that good, but they were amazing. Tina had intended to only eat half of her Fettuccine, but finished it off.  I of course not only devoured one of the carnitas tacos, but finished my Shrimp Scampi. The staff were very friendly, attentive and personable.  We didn't have dessert, but had mentioned the Butter Cake we would have to try on our next visit. The manager walked over and was disappointed we were about to leave.  She said she was going to bring us a Butter Cake on the house.  We thanked her, but told her how full we were. So she offered to send it home with us!  You know, it really was ""As good as it gets!""

We ordered an appetizer and pizzas, and a couple of other tables who were seated after us got their food before we did. The two people who were helping us were nice, but the service was very slow, and there were several servers (and cooks) standing around talking to each other.

My friend ordered the cheese macaroni appetizer and much to her disappointment was informed later that they were out of it. How long does it take to make another batch of it?

I ordered the California Fields salad, which has become a favourite with me. It was brought out in decent time, but there was a big piece of white lint sticking right out of the chicken at the top. How that got past the kitchen, I'll never know. I also don't know how the waiter didn't see it. So I called the manager and she sent it back. The next salad came back clean, or so I thought until I began mixing the chicken into the rest of the salad. Another piece of lint stuck to the greens poked out. Appetite lost, I called the waiter over. By that point, I just told them to take it off the bill and then bring the amended bill over, which they did. They did offer a replacement of some sort, but by then my appetite was gone and I didn't trust anything else from that kitchen.  Not going back.

The food was good, the waiter we had was friendly and the service wasn't slow.  However, I'd like to address two things. The waiter asked me if I wanted salt on the rim of the glass of my drink, I said yes. My drink came with no salt on the rim. To me, that isn't such a big deal so I didn't say anything.  The second thing I would like to address is the manager that was walking around asking people how everything was. What offended me was how she asked every other table excluding ours.

After waiting for over an hour for three salads and three Mac and cheese for the kids, I decided to let the manager know. Once I asked for the manager, some guy in the kitchen turns to me (from the Kitchen and we were in the dining area) and says yah.  Not a hello, not a can I help you, not even a, you need something? All I got was yah. Once he finally came to our table, I asked him, is this how he was trained by CPK, to just say Yah from the kitchen? He then said what is the problem. I explained to him that we have been waiting for over an hour for our food and that all we had were 3 salads and 3 Mac and cheese. His reply........you haven't been here an hour. It's been 50 min.  Instead trying to fix the problem he made it a bigger problem. Given that CPK has multiple locations and owners, I would suggest to the district manager that you need to retrain your GMs as they are clueless and rude when it comes to handling customer complaints.  Had Manni handled it like any other manager and simply said, I'm sorry, let me fix the problem, I would never have written this review and there wouldn't be hundreds of other potential customers reading this 1 star review either.  I guess CPK and all the officers don't give a crap about service. Maybe this is why they have NO LOCATIONS with any higher than a 3 star Yelp rating.

3,Ashtin Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,6,7.0,2.0,2017-09-27,"I love the CPK franchise. I am a huge fan of their menu and everything CPK.  These two stars are purely for service and hospitality. My two friends and i came into this location at 8 o clock maybe just a few mins after 8, but nonetheless more than an hour if not an hour and half before closing. It's not busy, just a couple of tables The hostess, I didn't catch her name, didn't seem very happy to seat us. Being a young group, all of us about 20, i figured a little attitude was just because we were ""kids."" Then again though, we are 20. We sat down for a gooooood 10+ mins before our server, Andrew, came to say hello. Again, it's really not that busy. He takes our order it's all good. After a while, we didnt get the complimentary bread, so we asked for some. He brought the bread, but we didn't get plates. We waited for him to come back either with plates out just to even come outside to check on his other tables which didn't happen. We waited to the point where i got up and went to get the plates myself. Once we finished the bread, i stacked up the plates and put them right on the corner for him so it's easier for him to pick it up later on to clear the table. the food comes out pretty fast and he put it down on the table but doesn't pick up the dirty plates stacked neatly for him. throughout the entire dinner the plates were still on the table. when we were finally all done with our dinner I stacked up every single plate for him on the table so it was easier for him to clear it. finally comes out to check up on us we order dessert and ask for the check. the desert took a little while to come out. a chocolate souffle that turned out to just be a chocolate brownie? (we also got charged for additional ice cream we didnt order but that's okay). the check did not come. I had to get up again to go get the check. we left at 9:30. it took an hour and a half for two entrees one appetizer and one dessert. it wasn't the food that took long to come out but it was more the server. we waited a while for just small things.  waiting for him to come back and get our credit cards and for him to bring the check back so we can sign it also took a while. gave him our validation tickets for parking and he didn't bring that back we had to go in and get it ourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino,3.72,3.48,3.48,,3.5760000000000005
2,Chrissy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,39,15.0,3.0,2017-10-03,"Decor - Very yellow. Entrees/ food - I always get the waldorf salad and bbq chicken pizza. The salad is always perfect, but sometimes the BBQ chicken pizza doesn't have enough sauce on it. Dessert - Salted caramel pudding is too sweet. Drinks - cucumber reviver is refreshing. Kids love -  any of the pastas. Price - ok. ** I always feel rushed (by the servers). Countless times I've eaten here, I've wanted to order another cocktail, but they give me my bill instead, before asking if I needed anything else. I think I'm a pretty nice customer - Am I that dispensable ??!!! But I've been coming to CPK for years because their Waldorf salad is still one of the best versions around, so I'll still be nice and give them a 3/5. **",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino,3.8,3.47,3.47,,3.6020000000000003

1,J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,3.0,2.0,2017-10-23,"I ordered this place last night to enjoy their chicken tequila fettuccine pasta to go. I usually order from the Tampa location located in the northridge mall but for some reason the price for the pasta was listed at 37$ through postmates so I decided to order at another location where the price was around 16$ for the same plate.  When it got to my house I was so excited because USUALLY that pasta is to die for! So good! I was extremely upset at what I got in my box. First, I asked for sundried tomatoes (normally not a problem to add at the Tampa location) to be added to my pasta. For some reason  they cut up a whole tomato and just threw it in so that added a weird taste overall. To add to that, the pasta tasted nothing like it should have. It was too oily, the sauce was completely off and the chicken tasted bland and undercooked like there was no seasoning added. I know the (not sundried) tomatoes may have changed the taste overall but my boyfriend had ordered the same plate with extra chicken no tomatoes and it STILL tasted like something a first grader threw together. So disappointed. And if this is how the food normally is, I won't be ordering from this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino,3.84,3.52,3.52,,3.648
