130,Michelle D.,"Escondido, United States",0,3,,3.0,2016-09-12,"So my experience with cpk I felt was interesting...the food was good the servers I did not like at all. I have worked in restaurants for years and these servers are super lazy. Now the fact that I noticed you guys had one busser I believe his name was William he is the fastest I have ever seen. But, i witnessed a couple of servers walking around with a whole bunch of dishes and trying to force them into his bus tub. I don't know about cpk but I thought you guys were supposed to be a family environment. When in reality it was uncomfortable. My server was a tall dirty blonde that thinks she is the shit. When I go out to restaurants I like to feel at home and comfortable not feel like I'm at a rave or in high school for that matter. My main question here is why is William a busser and not a server if he worked in my resturaunt he would definitely be promoted. Cpk should watch their back...because with a hard worker like William some big cooperation is going to steal him from you. Also I think it's really sad that the only one that impressed me in that resturaunt was a busser you guys at cpk should definitely get a handle on your employees. If I need my bussers to get trained well I will bring them to cpk to watch a pro and that was William great job young man!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=60,3.9159999999999995,3.9159999999999995,3.9159999999999995,3.9159999999999995,3.9159999999999995

First of all, I have to say I love the bar area, set out in the middle of the mall.  It's really classy, fully stocked, has a food menu, and very visible.  The visibility is one of the reasons I feel like the other bar(s) in the mall haven't been as busy as they should be.  The menu is classic.  We haven't had a CPK near here yet, and it's definitely time.  Awesome thin-crust pizzas (of course), and pretty decent entrees and appetizers as well.  Our event had us sampling several different dishes, and we ordered a few different drinks (all were good!)

28,Juliana C.,"San Diego, CA",659,242,3280.0,4.0,2016-11-29,"I got to eat here during their soft opening. I was lucky enough to bring a guest with me! Since my gf lives in Escondido, I invited her to join me.  We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was not fully packed, but it seemed really busy since there was a full staff running around. We ordered a couple of drinks, Honeybee Lemonade and water for me and she ordered a sprite and Blood Orange sangria. The lemonade was really good, you could hardly taste the bourbon. The sangria was extremely floral, too much for my tastes.  For starters, they brought us a sample of fried Mac and cheese ball and mushroom flatbread. Both were delish! For our entrees, we ordered a full shrimp Cesar salad and the Roasted garlic chicken. The salad was beyond huge, I wish it had more shrimp! The Roasted garlic chicken was so flavorful, I could eat just the garlic bits with the veggies and be perfectly happy. If you love garlic, you'll love this dish! Finishing with a slice of red velvet cake with white chocolate shavings... Love white chocolate!  All the staff was very nice and overly attentive. Good and bad. Every single server and manager checked on us. Filling our glasses with water, even though one was sprite... Constantly trying to clear the table of dishes... when I was not done picking at the bread or salad. Our server was Kiki, she was good and explained they needed to constantly ask if we needed anything and if they could take any dishes. It was too much and somewhat bothersome, but I the end too much attention is better than none.  Don't forget to sign up for Pizza dough rewards, you get a small plate on your first visit and dessert on your birthday! :) They also donated a portion of sales to Make-A-Wish!

51,Michelle K.,"San Marcos, CA",4,6,,1.0,2017-01-05,"I received a gift card from a coworker for the holidays and my boyfriend and I decided to eat there on January 2nd. We chose to eat out at the bar area as it was open seating. Our waitress Sam was very pleasant and kind but she was also the main bartender for the entire restaurant so I think she was having to do too many things at once, this review is not a knock on her personally. We were seated, drink order taken, food order taken and then it was all downhill from there. They were out of bread so we had to wait for the complimentary appetizer to arrive - not a biggie. Several more families and couples were seated after us and we started to notice that everyone that arrived after us was receiving their food. We only ordered a pizza and salad so nothing complicated. After about 30 minutes of waiting AFTER we had ordered our food I finally asked one of the servers (that was delivering another table of food to customers that arrived after us) if our food would be arriving soon as we had already waited a significant amount of time. She apologized, looked into it, and about 10 minutes later we finally received our food. This entire time our server, Sam, only checked on us once early on to see if we liked our drinks, never followed up to be sure we received our food and apparently didn't notice that all of her other tables had received their food. Still we did not complain, sometimes things happen at restaurants and we acknowledge it was probably just a mistake. Once she saw we had finally received our food she came over to check on us, mentioning she would have the manager come by to talk with us. The manager NEVER came by. Then it came time to pay. Remember I had a gift card for this restaurant and I had went onto the CPK website before we arrived, typed in the number, and received the balance. Good to go? Not so much. Sam tried to use the gift card, wouldn't swipe, typed in the numbers, received error message. This happened numerous additional times. Another server tried, then they tried another computer, then the manager tried, all times the card didn't work. Then the manager came to our table to ask about another form of payment. She inquired where the gift card was purchased, noting it was not one from their restaurants. It was a gift, how am I supposed to know. I brought up the information on the CPK website showing the number were valid and the amount of the gift card but she refused to try any further. It was obviously an error with their computers and not my gift card.  It was the tone and bitchiness of the manager and the accusatory nature of her grilling me about the gift card as if I was trying to run a scam on them or something that made me finally complain about the service we had received. Ultimately we paid with another form of payment, the manager took off 20% for my inconvenience, and we didn't leave a tip. Again, I don't blame Sam for the service issues - I believe she was having to do too much. A bartender for an entire restaurant shouldn't be made to also be server to the numerous tables in that area. I have worked customer service before and the manager failed us here. She was unapologetic, rude, and made her customer feel as though I was doing something wrong. For this reason we will never eat at that location again and CPK is one of my favorite restaurants. There are plenty of other restaurants to select at this location, choose one of those. Also to note that CPK customer service is horrible. I left a message and submitted a complaint on January 3rd that has yet to be acknowledge even though I received a general email notifying me they received my feedback and would be contacting me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.6920000000000006,3.6400000000000006

Their salads are always incredible, and many of their entrees are usually worth their hefty price.  - The Kids meals are a great value for a premium restaurant. Nice selection of Pizzas or noodles and you can even upgrade to a dessert if it's a treat night. - Their rewards program sucks..Once you sign up for their program your free small plate coupon expires in 21 days. No warning that this was going to happen or expire.

I will also point out up front that I had a very lovely experience at CPK. We took my daughter here to celebrate her making Student of the Month at her school. I've only been CPK once before and it was years ago in Hollywood, but I have great memories of the meal (and a nice Yelp review to look back on).  This Location inside the Westfield Mall is fairly new, so perhaps they are working out the kinks a bit. Our service was wonderful.

The crust was crispy, the cheese tasted freshly grated, and the toppings seemed super fresh as well.  My only complaint is with my own food. I ordered the WILD MUSHROOM STROZZAPRETI. It was very tasty, and I did enjoy it, but...it cost nearly $16, and the portion was TINY TINY TINY!!! I mean like, a tennis ball sized portion.  Seriously, are they paying a professional mushroom hunter to source their criminis and white buttons? Was the butter in the sauce imported at great expense from the Basque region of the Pyrenees Mountains? Were the noodles hand-made by Jesus Christ himself?!? I have been a chef for over 20 years: Pasta and mushrooms cost almost nothing. What's wrong with giving your customers an actual entrée portion? Because I feel like that dish should be served as a tapas style appetizer (for 1/3 the price), if that's the portion they're going to push.

The oil had herbs mixed in and was a great dipping alternative for the warm bread and crust of the pizza.  For what we needed to have a bite, it was a nice spot at the mall.

111,Michelle K.,"San Marcos, United States",4,6,,1.0,2017-05-01,"I received a gift card from a coworker for the holidays and my boyfriend and I decided to eat there on January 2nd. We chose to eat out at the bar area as it was open seating. Our waitress Sam was very pleasant and kind but she was also the main bartender for the entire restaurant so I think she was having to do too many things at once, this review is not a knock on her personally. We were seated, drink order taken, food order taken and then it was all downhill from there. They were out of bread so we had to wait for the complimentary appetizer to arrive - not a biggie. Several more families and couples were seated after us and we started to notice that everyone that arrived after us was receiving their food. We only ordered a pizza and salad so nothing complicated. After about 30 minutes of waiting AFTER we had ordered our food I finally asked one of the servers (that was delivering another table of food to customers that arrived after us) if our food would be arriving soon as we had already waited a significant amount of time. She apologized, looked into it, and about 10 minutes later we finally received our food. This entire time our server, Sam, only checked on us once early on to see if we liked our drinks, never followed up to be sure we received our food and apparently didn't notice that all of her other tables had received their food. Still we did not complain, sometimes things happen at restaurants and we acknowledge it was probably just a mistake. Once she saw we had finally received our food she came over to check on us, mentioning she would have the manager come by to talk with us. The manager NEVER came by. Then it came time to pay. Remember I had a gift card for this restaurant and I had went onto the CPK website before we arrived, typed in the number, and received the balance. Good to go? Not so much. Sam tried to use the gift card, wouldn't swipe, typed in the numbers, received error message. This happened numerous additional times. Another server tried, then they tried another computer, then the manager tried, all times the card didn't work. Then the manager came to our table to ask about another form of payment. She inquired where the gift card was purchased, noting it was not one from their restaurants. It was a gift, how am I supposed to know. I brought up the information on the CPK website showing the number were valid and the amount of the gift card but she refused to try any further. It was obviously an error with their computers and not my gift card.  It was the tone and bitchiness of the manager and the accusatory nature of her grilling me about the gift card as if I was trying to run a scam on them or something that made me finally complain about the service we had received. Ultimately we paid with another form of payment, the manager took off 20% for my inconvenience, and we didn't leave a tip. Again, I don't blame Sam for the service issues - I believe she was having to do too much. A bartender for an entire restaurant shouldn't be made to also be server to the numerous tables in that area. I have worked customer service before and the manager failed us here. She was unapologetic, rude, and made her customer feel as though I was doing something wrong. For this reason we will never eat at that location again and CPK is one of my favorite restaurants. There are plenty of other restaurants to select at this location, choose one of those. Also to note that CPK customer service is horrible. I left a message and submitted a complaint on January 3rd that has yet to be acknowledge even though I received a general email notifying me they received my feedback and would be contacting me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.5960000000000005,3.2800000000000002

The location is nice and right by target. The bar is nice and out in the open in the middle of the mall. There wasn't much on he happy hour. But the food was still good.

The oil had herbs mixed in and was a great dipping alternative for the warm bread and crust of the pizza.  For what we needed to have a bite, it was a nice spot at the mall.

Stick with the pizza and you won't be disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2,2.64,3.1,3.1,,2.9160000000000004
