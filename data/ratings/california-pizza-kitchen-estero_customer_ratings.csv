63,Lisa S.,"North Fort Myers, FL",3,13,3.0,2.0,2015-08-19,"I definitely had higher expectations of this place-as most restaurants at Coconut Point Mall are very good. They were way over priced- we ordered take-out- got two pizzas and an order of the Carnitas taco meal. We spent about $40- which would have been fine if the food blew me away. But the pizzas were tiny- 10"" personal pizzas- we didn't order the thin crust- thank goodness- because the regular crust was already way too thin. My daughter and I usually love the crust- this was not good at all. The toppings were very skimpy- we ordered 1 cheese- and there was hardly any cheese on there. In addition to that- it wasn't even good quality cheese- it was greasy and didn't melt consistently. The other pizza we ordered was sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  Also, not very good. The carnitas tacos were supposed to be slow roasted pork- the pork was bite sized crispy pieces of what tasted like mystery meat. And there was no cilantro, although they were supposed to have it on top. It was two tacos, served with chips and salsa- the chips tasted stale. I have to say I was not at all impressed. The reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the service. It was fast, friendly and efficient. Unfortunately that's not enough to cover the food quality and the price.
