So when we went the last time, and it didn't taste the same as usual, we checked with the server if this was the version with alcohol. He confirmed it was not, and asked if we were not happy with it. We said it was ok, and he left. I didn't much of it, since he didn't say anything, but a few minutes later the manager came over and asked if there was an issue. We explained it wasn't a big deal but the Pineapple Colada tasted different than what we had before. The manager offered to get a new one without us asking for it. It was a really nice gesture on his part, and as a result we were happy with the experience. The service has always been competent at this location, except for one bad experience a few trips ago.

The bartender was kind enough to bring me another type of salsa which helped with the flavor somewhat. My husband ordered a pepperoni. Flavors were ok, but it was really greasy.  On the upside, service was friendly and efficient. I am going to have to agree with Leslie L. This restaurant has definitely seen better days.

We shared the Butter Cake with vanilla ice cream, which was basically a moist pound cake.  It was good and sweet, a nice way to end dinner.  It's larger than it looks in the picture, by the way, so be prepared to be stuffed.

Even the food they spew as ""healthy"" still has more calories than fast food places. But anyway, I have been here and ordered, almost all the pasta dishes and I love the portions they give! The cost is definitely worth what you get! Same with the pizzas. I like the Thai Peanut Pizza the best because it's a flatbread pizza. I also like the mushroom one as well. The Tortilla Sedona soup is also a favorite but I will warn you, it's very salty! Same with some of the pizzas. But the pasta dishes are really good and they are full of flavor. I don't think I've gotten anything I disliked. My favourite salad to get is the Thai Crunch salad. So yummy!! Service is always the same, quick and nice servers.

140,John K.,"Fairfax, United States",304,379,1882.0,2.0,2016-05-09,"Saturday found us rushing to Fairfax Corner to make movie time for ""The Tunnel"", which by the way is about a man who gets trapped inside a tunnel after it collapses as he's driving through it. I really would've preferred neighboring Ozzie's, but it was rather busy and we were in a mad rush. No matter, let's get on with this review of the vapid and uninspiring eats at California Pizza Kitchen.  I've been to California Pizza Kitchen all of four times in my entire life and this being the fourth. Two times were at airports when I was either delayed or on a layover and once with a friend for drinks. Perhaps, I can focus on something positive. The host and hostess were very polite and might I dare even nod towards charming? And, this is where it pretty much ends for me. Service *** / ***** Accommodations | Atmosphere **** / ***** Value ** / ***** Spaghetti Bolognese ** / ***** BBQ Chicken Pizza ** / ***** Salmon | Corn Medley *** / ***** Our server was rather humdrum and she spent more time on her phone versus paying attention to her patrons. Unresolved on eating pizza, I impulsively decided on spaghetti. I want to avoid sounding harsh, but the spaghetti was likely on the same level as that served to me and the other 8th grade kids in the cafeteria when I clearly had an immature and less discerning palate. The pizza was dry and boring. No personality other than the pineapples that my good wife asked for. Possibly and just a possibility in that there might have been some redeeming qualities about my daughter's salmon entree. Salmon was tender and cooked through without tasting rubbery, but the corn medley was off the charts in terms of salt. Can't figure out America's infatuation with salt. Price point is contentious here. Food quality doesn't quite chart high enough to justify the prices. You won't burn a hole in your wallet, but there is a disparity in money spent and appeal. Lesson learned. Leave early enough before the movie to dine at an establishment that will deliver in terms of overall value and appeal. Well, it is within a stone's throw of the theatre, but this point alone is not compelling enough to return.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax,3.4,3.35,3.35,3.1760000000000006,3.37

The host and hostess were very polite and might I dare even nod towards charming? And, this is where it pretty much ends for me. Service *** / ***** Accommodations | Atmosphere **** / ***** Value ** / ***** Spaghetti Bolognese ** / ***** BBQ Chicken Pizza ** / ***** Salmon | Corn Medley *** / ***** Our server was rather humdrum and she spent more time on her phone versus paying attention to her patrons. Unresolved on eating pizza, I impulsively decided on spaghetti. I want to avoid sounding harsh, but the spaghetti was likely on the same level as that served to me and the other 8th grade kids in the cafeteria when I clearly had an immature and less discerning palate. The pizza was dry and boring. No personality other than the pineapples that my good wife asked for. Possibly and just a possibility in that there might have been some redeeming qualities about my daughter's salmon entree. Salmon was tender and cooked through without tasting rubbery, but the corn medley was off the charts in terms of salt. Can't figure out America's infatuation with salt. Price point is contentious here. Food quality doesn't quite chart high enough to justify the prices. You won't burn a hole in your wallet, but there is a disparity in money spent and appeal. Lesson learned. Leave early enough before the movie to dine at an establishment that will deliver in terms of overall value and appeal. Well, it is within a stone's throw of the theatre, but this point alone is not compelling enough to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax,3.6,3.48,3.48,3.1440000000000006,3.5280000000000005

He thought it was great, I didnt think it was bad but I loved my pizza more haha. I got the Jamaican Jerk pizza, so forgive me for being biased; I love this pizza, it never disappoints me.

142,Marion D.,"Centreville, United States",0,1,,5.0,2017-09-12,"Before I start my review, I have to apologize to Elli & Jorge that it's taken me so long to write it.  My husband and I have been going to this CPK regularly pretty much since they opened. In all those years, we have always received the most wonderful, friendly, and attentive service. Several servers come by our table just to say hello, even if we're sitting at another server's table. One such server was Elli. She always gave the most amazing and friendly service and came to chat for a few minutes even when she wasn't waitressing our table. Well, Elli is the manager now, and we couldn't be happier for her! She still comes by our table every time she sees us. She has told us that she loves what she does, and it shows!  At our last visit to CPK, Elli told us that one of the chef's, Jorge, had come up with a ceviche pizza for a company-wide competition. She asked if we would like to try it (of course we did!!), so she asked Jorge to bake one of his special pizzas just for us. It was beyond amazing!!! I feel kind of guilty, but my husband and I polished off the entire pizza; we just couldn't stop eating! It certainly proved that Jorge is an excellent chef in his own right who is capable of so much more than just following CPK's recipes. Elli asked Jorge to come to our table so we could thank him personally, and he was so nice; he seemed genuinely happy to hear how much we liked his pizza. Which brings me to the food-part of my review, although I'm sure you could guess by now that we're not regulars at this restaurant just for the excellent service. The food is excellent as well and has been so consistently through all these years. In too many restaurants, the quality diminishes over time, but this has never been the case at this CPK location.  I could list some of our favorite dishes here, but honestly, I might as well just insert a copy of the menu! We've had many different dishes, from salads to pizzas and pasta dishes, and they are all amazing. I can't wait to find out how Jorge did in the competition. I hope his ceviche pizza won, because that would mean it would become part of CPK's menu, and it would definitely become one of my absolute favorites!

They loaded the pizza with toppings which is good because you're paying $15 for a personal pizza.

The service was fast and fairly friendly. We went on veterans day, I think they had a discount for veterans and active military.
