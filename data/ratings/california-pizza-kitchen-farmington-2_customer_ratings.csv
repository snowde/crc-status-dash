Honestly I came here because my family wanted to come but it's not something that I would go out of my way to eat-- but only because I don't really like CPC food in general. This location has been great in terms of service and I wouldn't mind coming here again with family.

While it's not quite as special or unique as it was back then, they've done enough renovations and updates to their menu to keep it fresh. Recently went back to the new restaurant, which is brighter and has some bigger tables than before. Service was very good. Efficient and prompt -- which is what you want in a mall place.  As for the food, the spinach artichoke dip is our favorite comfort food, even if it probably has 1000 calories. The pizza crust seems to be updated (in a good way), but the BBQ chicken was a big hit with the oldest kid.  I enjoyed the sicilian thin crust. Big enough to split for sure.  And we liked the Torilla rolls too. And don't miss the Salted Caramel dessert. Yummy!  Overall, it's a solid chain restaurant and we'd come here again any day.

Went for lunch and got a lunch duo of pizza and salad. The lunch duos are odd, there are only a few pizzas, soups, salads and sandwiches you can choose from. Some of the stuff isn't even on the regular menu. They have half sandwiches but you can't actually order just a while sandwich. You only get to combine two items from the sub-par offering of the lesser menu items...or you can order off the regular menu to get the ""good stuff"" and pay ridiculous prices. Either way is no win. I got the personal mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza with a Caesar salad. It was not worth 10.95. Pizza was all crust, I left a pile of crust carcasses on the plate, which took up the same surface area that the pizza had. The part with toppings was fine but was really about the size of one slice or less of actual pizza. The Caesar salad was gross. The cheese looked like it had been sitting out for a week and was all yellow. Who sees that and  still serves it?  One of my friends got baked potato soup and it was thick like glue. She scooped some on the spoon, flipped the spoon upside down and the soup stuck to the spoon. She said it looked like a can of condensed cream of broccoli soup before you add the liquid to it. Not appetizing. The worst part of it all is the server never asked how anything was, saw leftover food on our plates (including completely uneaten soup) and never asked if there was an issue. Probably because he knows the food is gross and doesn't want to hear it! For the money you can do better for lunch just about anywhere else in the area.

The ambience and the service has always been good too. The thin crust pizza's are an absolute delight, lite and crispy and saves you from the guilt of all the cheese of a regular pizza :) I ask for a side of the southwest ranch with the spring rolls to give it a little heat, they go well. The service has always been good too, the waiters/waitress are always very friendly and helpful in recommending or giving you insights into their specials.  I was disappointed with my visit today and hence the two star rating. The silverware that was given to us (me and my partner) was so dirty and had food remains on it; looked like it was not washed properly. We were given replacements when we mentioned it to the waitress, but I'd expect that things like this are take care of.

I hadn't been there in a LONG time, and the last time I went I was sick with terrible cold, including post nasal drip and a stuffy nose.  So, I literally couldn't taste much.  Yesterday my wife and I decided to pick up some pizza to go. We didn't really have time to sit down, but she had some sort of rewards from CPK so we wanted to use it.  Their online menu doesn't have any prices so my wife used a third party app to figure out how much things cost. My wife said that when she went inside the price was higher than expected. She asked why and they told her what the price of the pizza was higher than what we read online.  The young woman helping her called over the manager, my wife explained that the third party app was wrong, but also it's hard to order online because CPK doesn't have prices. The manager, was very kind she said, he honored her 10 dollars rewards and then put the remaining balance on the house so we can get our pizza free.  My wife said he was very kind and understanding through the entire conversation and I feel like that is GREAT customer service! ON TOP OF THAT, the Jamaican jerk pizza we ordered was SO SO good.  My only tip to CPK is that they REALLLLYYYY should have their prices online. I understand it's a chain, so that is likely an issue that would have to be fixed by corporate or something.

I really think the only thing you should order here is pizza, hence the name. But I decided to try something that wouldn't be so heavy so I went with the Banh mi bowl which has about 15.59? It was skimpy and barely had any chicken. I'm pretty sure I bit on a small rock that was in my dish at some point or sand also. Felt literally like a bunch of raw vegetables thrown into a bowl with some chicken and a handful of quinoa. Bill came out to 17.44 with tip (service was mediocre at best).

86,Diego A.,"Farmington, United States",3,67,5.0,4.0,2017-07-16,A good visit. We ordered the fried mac and cheese. So good! It was my first time trying it; no regrets! Ordered a Margherita thin crust pizza and regular cheese pizza for my boyfriend. Both tasted great. We skipped the desert because we were full. But was definitely worth it. Only slight downside was that the bread was a little bit hard...maybe too hard for my taste but it was still delicious. And filling of course. Our waiter was nice. Haven't been here in years and I liked the new look a lot. More modern. Will have to come back to try the bbq chicken sandwich. Sounds amazing.

We did see others get their lunches before us, however, even though they were seated well after us. All we had ordered was 3 appetizers to share. Nothing crazy. They did bring us additional bread and dip with apologies for the slower than normal service. Although I have had the pizza previously, yesterday I had a craving for the avocado egg rolls and chicken lettuce wraps (which I think are the best around). My husband usually get the petite wedge salad no matter what. Food was good, no complaints there.
