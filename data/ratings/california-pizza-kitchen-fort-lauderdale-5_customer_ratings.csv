125,Cory F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,31,1.0,2.0,2012-04-16,"New owner. New menu. Bad food. We used to eat here regularly but haven't been for a few months. Apparently it's under new ownership and this location is being used to test a new menu. We both got our regular pasta dishes (Garlic Cream and Chicken Taquila Fettucini). First, both had a mountain of pasta and half the chicken they used to have. All the extra pasta soaked up the sauce and made it taste bland. The Chicken Taquila needed a ton of salt. There was around 5 or 6 little nuggets of chicken in each dish. Both dishes made us feel sick afterwards. We normally get the herb onion focaccia which comes with olive oil and tomatoes, but they no longer have it. Instead we got a cheese focaccia appetizer. It came with a little dish of oil and grated cheese. It was gross and didn't taste freshly baked. I gave it 2 stars for fast service, but we won't eat here again.

But they had a Facebook coupon for a free Quinoa (apparently pronounced kin-wah) and arugula salad that was new to their menu. And one thing I am a fan of is free food. Hoo-ah! Sadly, the coupon is one per table and we just weren't in enough of a mood to sit at three different tables. So I got the salad and my two lunchmates had something else. The salad was excellent - a lot of the quinoa stuff (it's like cous cous, I guess) and sweet red onions, feta cheese and a champagne vinaigrette dressing.

The service was marginally attentive, but the server forgot to bring the bread she offered to us. The soda was weak and flat, and I asked for a different one. The server brought another, equally horrible soda. When I pointed this out, the server made some excuse about using a different tap, rather than verifying that the new soda was actually better before serving it. The iced tea replacement was adequate, after it took 5 minutes to arrive. The pasta was undercooked and bland. The pizza was cool to the touch when served. It also had no flavor. The server did have the manager remove the pasta dish, but the manager didn't bother to waddle over to see how we were doing.  If he didn't care enough to personally see if there was something he could do, I see no reason to give him or his company any more business.  I won't go back.

The menu has changed, found most of what we loved was either different or no longer offered. Potato Leek Soup, wherefore art thou? Chicken Tequila Fettucine has always been my favorite. Not any more. It seems they have completely changed the recipe, as well as the portion size. The sauce was runny, not creamy, it sat at the bottom of the pan. I had to swirl the noodles in it to get any flavor on them. Very little chicken and not much else of interest in my dish. Nothing special about this plate now.

24,Suzy B.,"Burbank, CA",83,23,2.0,1.0,2015-11-06,"Ok, so I just relocated to Ft. Lauderdale from living 25 years in Los Angeles, so I know a little bit about CPK.  I've eaten at the one in Burbank, the one in Studio City and the one by the Dorothy Chandler, so I was happy to take my folks to the CPK on Federal a few weeks after I moved here.   Now, I know it's best to stick to the Pizza, because it's called the California PIZZA Kitchen, but my folks wanted the pasta and after packing and unpacking, I needed protein so against my better judgement I ordered the fire grilled ribeye (which was, by the way, as expensive as anything I ordered at The Palm, where they know a little something about steak) So we ordered from a server named Ellen and waited.   And we waited while a couple was seated across the aisle from us.   And we waited while that couple was served, And we waited while that couple finished their meal. And paid their check. And left.  And no sign of Ellen.  Eventually we got our meals.  This is where the fun starts. Ellen walked over to me and my fire-grilled-ribeye-steak and asked me if I wouldn't mind cutting into it while she was there TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE I had ordered (which was medium rare)  There is no restaurant on the planet where I had ordered steak where the server asked me to cut into my meat while she watched.  Which should tell you a little something about the cooks in the kitchen and the servers in the front of the house.  I noticed that my folks pasta (and we're Italian, so we know a little something about the stuff) and the pasta and the sauce had that ""we've been sitting in the pass since the other couple started on their main course"" kind of look.  So I asked ELLEN if the pasta had been sitting under heat lamps and instead of apologizing for the food and offering to replace it, she said ""We don't have heat lamps"", which I I'm she knows because this is a server who, I'm sure, had apprenticed at MikeyD's.  So we dug in.  The fire-grilled-rib-eye was almost inedible.  Maybe half of it was edible.  The rest of it was fat & gristle.  And at Palm prices.  So after getting a bill for over $100.00, we left and I decided to write to CPK to tell them about our experience.   This is where it gets even better.  I got an email in reply and then a call from a Mr. Will Stringer, who asked me to call him back on his cell phone (321-917-0166) So I did, but went to voice mail where the mail box was full. (Surprised? I'm not.) So I called every day for a week. Sometimes twice a day.  Always the mailbox was full.  So I returned to the original email I got from CPK and replied about Mr. Stringer and the fact that I couldn't contact him and asked someone else to get in touch with me.  And have heard nothing, from no one.  So here I am on yelp, hoping to let all the BBQ chicken pizza loving people out there that this is not the CPK to go to, and if you do: Do not order the fire-grilled-ribeye Do not order the pasta and Do not sit in Ellen's section.  You can get flat bread pizza from almost anywhere now and there are easy recipes for BBQ chicken pizza on line that you could make at home, without this aggravation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=60,3.88,3.88,3.88,2.6600000000000006,3.88

Jason suggested capicola (Italian ham)  as it is mild and thinly sliced. He ate all but one piece. 5) Half a caesar salad  - Big salad on plate - very tasty with good cheese and dressing. More than double what my friend though when she ordered it but said it was excellent. 6) I had Fettuccine in a garlic cream alfredo sauce with chicken. Good flavor,, hot with freshly grated cheese.

My absolute favorites are the Kung Pao spaghetti, oh my god it's SO good! I crave it almost every day, and I thought nothing could even touch that dish until I tried their Dakota smashed pea and barley soup. I know how boring that may sound, but I love soup and especially pea soup. Never in my life have I had pea soup as great as that. I know I may sound like I'm being over dramatic about soup, but I'm not. It's as amazing as the Kung Pao spaghetti.

I ordered the Hawaiian which was great. Fresh pineapple and ham. Delicious. OH and the bread they give you before is amazing. You have to eat it. You have to ask for more. Dip it in the vinegar and oil- you must! You must! We had the red and white sangria. My favorite was the red- the white was too sweet for me. Dessert was the butter cake. Wanna know what heaven is like- try the butter cake. There is no other way to describe the feeling you feel when you bite into that warm cake mixed with the cold vanilla ice cream. Shout out to our waitress Ellen who was a true rock star. Our cups were never empty. Our plates were always taken from us when we were finished. She was super friendly, helpful, and efficient.

27,Mark W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,7,,1.0,2017-04-19,"I don't know if this particular location is a franchise or if the entire chain is falling apart.  For years, this place was packed and had a great manager.  The service was excellent and many servers stayed there for years.  The food was consistent and reasonable, as it has generally been at the locations we've eaten in around the country.  A few years ago they changed their pizza crust recipe, which to my taste made it drier and tougher. If you don't eat it while it's hot forget about it.  Then they updated the decor, and while I like it, a lot of people were put off by it.  Meanwhile, the terrific manager at this location left and the food and service is extremely unreliable now.  It can be good or it can be horrendous. Unfortunately, three bad meals in a row and we threw in the towel (or rather, napkin).  Speaking of which, they have even changed their napkin. It's now an extremely cheap paper napkin that falls apart upon impact with your hand or mouth.  The final straw was last week.  The four of us entered the restaurant which seemed to have more staff than diners (it was a quiet afternoon on Easter Sunday).  We waited for a host or hostess to come to the front and greet us but everyone who saw us just turned their heads away despite no indication that they had anything better to do.  This includes the new manager.  Finally, one of us walked over to the manager and politely explained that we had been waiting for several minutes (amid an ocean of empty tables) and no one had so much as acknowledged us. He apologized profusely and then he was at our table every five minutes but, alas, the food was terrible.  Even the one thing I always could count on, the original chopped salad, had less salami, less chicken, no cheese unless it was just tasteless, and too little dressing (and I don't like a lot of dressing on salad).  It was basically a plate of romaine lettuce for almost $16.  Even the chop on the lettuce was off (the lettuce was chopped less finely, probably so it would have more volume and look bigger on the plate). Guess what? You aren't fooling anyone. So sorry this old reliable restaurant has gone the way of retail hasbeens like Sears and J.C. Penney.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=60,3.2,3.54,3.54,,3.404000000000001

The last three times the dishes were dirty. the soup was burnt twice. The food was not consistent. We have been eating here for 10 years. It is very disappointing. Does anyone know if management changed? Update 5/29/17: about 3 weeks ago someone from CPK reached out to see if they could give me a call to talk about the bad experiences lately. I replied sure and provided my cell number. Still no call. Sadness,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5,3.16,3.51,3.51,,3.37

19,John M.,"Coral Springs, FL",79,8,,1.0,2017-06-26,"By far worst experience I had at any of the CPK locations, ate there Saturday night ending up having to take the pizza to-go being that it took 35 minutes from time of order to arrival of soup and a salad then another 12 minutes for the pizza to arrive. I understand being busy or behind but the place was nearly empty. The manager stopped by the table at one point she did not mention anything about the lack of service or provide any help when it was obvious that service was lacking. Ended but leaving normal 20% tip because I was not sure if the server was new or not. As for the manager really no excuse for the experience we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5,3.24,3.53,3.53,,3.414
43,Marc L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",38,85,2.0,3.0,2017-06-26,"We went to CPK for an early dinner yesterday since we were heading home from the beach with 3 kids.  The place was empty and yet the service was sooooooo slow...why???  We put in our orders for the drinks and then went to order Flatbreads and found out that they only have your choice of 2 Flatbreads??  We decided on the LETTUCE WRAPS and SHAVED MUSHROOM + SPINACH FLATBREAD to start.  For our entrees, the kids had 2 Personal Pizzas and the Grilled Chicken + Broccoli. We also had the SEDONA TORTILLA soup and a   MARGHERITA pizza.  Now the food was ok and I don't really think any of us had any complaints about the food itself, but with the restaurant being rather empty, we did not expect the slow and spotty service.  It was so very frustrating to ask for something and then keep waiting, and then by the time they bring you what you initially asked for, then we need something else.  There was absolutely no reason for the slow service in an empty restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=20,3.28,3.53,3.53,,3.43

9,Roy H.,,22,100,19.0,2.0,2017-08-16,Thin crust pizza is just the right amount of thinness and crisp but because it's the same amount of dough spread thinner it comes out lacking enough sauce to make up for the larger circumference.

1,Mike H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,18,11.0,1.0,2017-09-16,"We were looking forward to eating some CPK so we drive over there in rush hour to eat. Anyway we get seated our waiter I believe his name was angel came by and was completely rude and sounded kind of pissed that he had to take a table. He gets our drink order comes back with our drinks and that's the last time we saw him. We waited for about 15 minutes and no one else came by, we just sat there waiting. So I go to the hostess and asked her if we could get a new waiter since we haven't even seen ours in over 15 minutes. She tells me she thinks Angel was our waiter but he left. I don't understand how you can take a table knowing you're about to get off and not tell anybody. That just seems ridiculous and ridiculously rude on top of that. We go to this California pizza kitchen all the time and to get this kind of service is crazy. So the hostess goes to get us a new waiter and it's not her fault she just walked in as I was telling her this but again we wait another 5-6 minutes and no one comes by meanwhile people are getting seated people that  got there after us are getting their food and we're still sitting there starving with no one coming to us. Absolutely absurd. The lack of service in this place today was awful. The hostess was really trying I could tell but everything else was a far cry from awful.

I ordered a salad and it came out with only half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. It was missing key ingredients like avocado, artichoke hearts, etc. The funny thing is a manager came by to check on tables. He came by before our food was served and we said everything was fine. Then he came back after the food was served and asked if I wanted a box for my untouched salad. I told him no thanks because it wasn't what I thought it would be. I didn't have the menu in front of me to state what was different from my expectations at the time. He takes my plate and looks like he is sorry. He never asked if I wanted anything else.

I don't know why we never come.  I ordered the bahn mi bowl with shrimp and my boyfriend was struggling to decide between shrimp scampi and the carne asada pizza and the server told us he could do half and half; great!  My bowl was so good. Very fresh, lots of flavor and beautiful presentation. The shrimp scampi part of my boyfriend's pizza was amazing. The flavor was perfect, I loved the arugula on top, and the crust was nice and crispy.  For appetizer we got the charred shishito peppers, which again, did not disappoint. The sauce was delicious, I kept dipping my bread in it rather than the olive oil and herbs.  The service was very good. Our waitress was so nice and helpful. Another good point was the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was nice and bright and everything very clean.
