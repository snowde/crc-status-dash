88,Kiel T.,"Visalia, CA",21,15,,2.0,2012-11-03,"We are not huge fans of most chain restaurants, but the lady was craving some Cal Pizza Kitchen (she frequented another location during college and hasn't had it since), so we decided to go out. When we arrived at 7pm, it was a typical Friday night: busy.  We waited a brief 20 minutes outside and were seated promptly.  Being a party of two meant quicker seating at one of the many 1x1 booths. Five stars so far. (We did notice that when we were seated an overwhelming number of tables hadn't been cleared which was contributing to the long delay) One seated, we waited several minutes before getting menus and drink orders.  The unsettling part is the waitress who eventually served us had passed by multiple times.  A simple ""I'll be right with you guys"" would've gone a long way. -0.5 stars When we placed our drink order, we also ordered the corn guacamole from the small plates menu.  We both enjoyed everything about it.  Still no drinks. -1.0 stars We ordered a cobb salad on romaine with blue cheese dressing & beets, five cheese and fresh tomato pizza and two cups of soup; the soup is what the Mrs was craving the most.  The waitress asked if we would like the soup first to which we confirmed.  After a surprisingly short wait the food arrived and the drinks soon followed.  We asked about the soup and the gentleman said he would check.  He ended up bringing only one cup at our request.  The pizza was great and the salad was fresh.  However, the salad was coated with ranch, not blue cheese.  We also had to ask for utensils.  -0.5 stars for each. The most frustrating part about our experience seemed to be everyone except our waitress.  Knowing how Ca Pizza Kitchen works their tips, it was painful to not tip normally.

72,Drew W.,"Clovis, CA",0,9,,2.0,2013-10-03,"Things that happened at CPK last night: 1)  We came in a large party (14+).  A few folks in our party ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti, but one person ordered it without peanuts.  The food took a long time to arrive, and when it did one of the servers messed up and gave the no-peanuts Kung Pao to the wrong person, who already started eating it so it was too late to swap.  Oddly enough, the server didn't tell the person who got the no-peanuts Kung Pao that their dish didn't have peanuts and just assumed that they would be OK with it.  To make matters worse, apparently they ran out of spaghetti so they had to remake the dish (which already took too long to come out) without peanutes and with a different type of pasta.  To make matters even worse, the restaurant didn't even have the decency to offer some kind of discount for their screw up.  They charged full price. 2)  I had ordered the 2 for $30 deal and nothing else.  When the bill came, it was $50.  When I asked the server why my bill was so high, her automatic response was, ""oh it's tax and tip,"" which, obviously, uh no.  I told her I don't think she charged us right, she eventually agreed and took the bill to her manager.  So bill #2 comes back and this time it's around $40, with a $7 tip, which amounts to a ~21% tip even if the tip was calculated after tax.  Evidently, the only thing the server changed was the base price of the meal and she didn't recalculate her 18% gratuity based on the lower price.  So the tip was calculated based on the incorrect higher price from the first bill.  Ultimately, the second bill overcharged me by about a dollar.  For a half second I thought about whether I should send the bill back AGAIN, but eventually just let it slide since she already demonstrated a deficiency in math so she probably didn't do it on purpose.  Enjoy your extra dollar (hopefully on a math book). I have to give CPK some credit for having decent tasting food, huge portions and reasonable prices (when they charge you correctly).  However, yesterday's service was pretty bad so IMO there's no reason to go unless someone else in your group is really craving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=80,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.1440000000000006,3.1600000000000006

82,Rhonda T.,"Fresno, CA",67,3,,1.0,2014-05-23,"Have been coming here for several years. Always order the same thing, the wait staff who serve me at curbside even know I am allergic to avocado. I ordered a salad tonight and clearly said NO AVOCADO. I had a long day and just got home to eat my salad. Imagine my shock when it was full of avocado. I called the restaraunt, that is now closed, and told the girl who answered about the salad. She got a manager on the phone. I was polite but not happy. She must have been having a bad night because there was no apology at all and the first thing she said was ""what do you want me to do about it""? After I recovered from being taken aback from this question I said I would come in tomorrow and get the correct salad. She said she couldn't do that, that she would have to either send me something in the mail or reverse the charges. I told her to reverse the charges. When she looked up the order she said I did ask for avocado. No...that was my sons. After enduring her tone I asked her if she was upset with me, because it sure did seem that way. Then I got the lecture. It was at this point I realized she didn't care and I just wanted the call over with. She reversed the charges on my card, I hung up. As a very regular customer I find this so disappointing. My food allergy is very serious and I have always appreciated the extra care CPK seemed to take when it came to this. I guess I would have expected the management to at least act like they cared and not treated me in such a manner. Pretty sure they can look back in their records and see this is the same order, pretty much every time, and I have ordered this A LOT.

41,VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",63,624,11989.0,4.0,2014-10-06,"The pizza here is great...you really cant go wrong. I have been a CPK fan for many years and was here yesterday to get a sick relative something to eat.  Instead of getting my order to-go, I decided to dine in. The hostess was in an almost zombie like state, she took us to our table, laid the menus down and muttered something about wanting to eat my brains...I kid, I kid. I don't have brains, lol. She did not tell me about the specials, she just laid the 'specials' menu down. She never once said who my server was, enjoy my meal or anything.  My waitress was good, but a little on the slow side. I asked for a refill on my soda and it took her over 10 min to come back. She was even slow with the table behind me, and they ended up being compensated for that...that's how slow she was. Unfortunately I was not compensated ;( Anyways, my server was great to tell me about the specials and their current promotions. Right now if you sign up for their e-mail membership, you get a FREE small plate app. You can either register online or on the card in house. For my free app, I opted for the Fried Mac n Cheese. It did not come out the way in which my server described, so I was kind of bummed. It was four tiny little fried balls with a little bit of cheese sauce. I do have to say, the panko breading was REALLY crispy and good. The mac n cheese tasted like Velveeta, which isn't bad if you like Velveeta. The cheese had a really generic flavor, I expected more from CPK since they are all 'gourmet' and fancy. I personally would not order them again. For my main entrée I went with the crowd favorite...BBQ Chicken Pizza. It was served piping hot within minutes after I ordered it, and was brought to me by the Chef himself...perhaps he knew that my server was slower than a snail and didn't want my food getting cold. The pizza was near perfection. There was an abundance of toppings from the cilantro, onions, chicken all the way to the BBQ sauce. The dough was super warm and had a nice crisp to it. Only complaint about the dough was that it tasted a tad too salty. The atmosphere has changed over the years, not sure for the better. The pizza prices continue to climb, but the service and ambience have been going down. They used to have your silverware wrapped in a black cloth napkin, and now you get it rolled in a generic brown paper napkin. You no longer get bread and butter when seated, you have to request it. They also took some good menu items away. All in all it is a decent experience and I quite possibly will return, but with so many other options in town it may be a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.6,3.1600000000000006

24,Joel G.,"Fresno, CA",16,66,16.0,2.0,2014-12-03,"I've never understood this place. I mean back in the 90's when it was a cool business model to put a new hip spin on an old classic, Starbucks you're my Rachel, and CPK you're my Ross. CPKs food is basically over priced flatbread and horrible salads. I don't care you have a bar. Not much going on here.  Much like the TV show Friends, CPK has not aged well with its white button ups tucked into their jeans like they're competing with Ellen in a mom pants contest. To refer back, Rachel and Starbucks you went on to become more relevant and seductive over the years. CPK, you are a bit of a dinosaur just waiting for a meteor to completely crater your business. One day a Jewish paleontologist from New York named Ross will unearth you and declare you permanently extinct while sipping from a warm hot cup of arabica Rachel goodness. I wish CPK nothing but failure and perhaps the restaurant space will one day be filled with something worthy of that elite corner location like say another Starbucks.  Nothing personally to the staff as they are kind and friendly enough. I doubt they'll have a hard time finding another restaurant gig in river park. There are as many restaurants to choose from in River Park as there are triple-bypass patients at the heart hospital up the street. And as anyone knows service skills are easily transferable. As longs as the patrons keep coming, and the doors stay open don't listen to me CPK staff. But honestly it's flat bread, have some pride. It's a one trick pony.

The tomato sauce was sweet and slightly spicy. The cheese was VERY stretchy; the real deal. I like the chunks of fresh basil and tomatoes, too (we got the Margharetta).  I like their GF appetizer options; the wedge salad had a sweet dressing offset by the rich bleu cheese and bacon. My friend got the corn-and-black-bean guacamole; I could try it because the mole itself is GF, but the chips are fried in a cross-contaminated fryer. The chewy corn gives texture to the creamy avocado, and the flavor of each ingredient is expressed.  My server, Lindsay, was attentive and quick, even when asking her lots of safety questions.

I go to show her and sure enough pull out a small strand of hair. I put it back on the plate and inform the waitress. I didnt want to make a scene or anything free. I just wanted a fresh batch. I use to work in a kitchen and things happen, they shouldn't, but they do. She was very curteous and took them back to get me a new order. Shortly after a manager comes over who I watched walk over from the other side of the restaurant without ever going into the kitchen himself  (they wear earpieces) and tells me, ""That wasn't a hair, that was cheese.""

We ordered three pizzas and the Kung-pao chicken spaghetti. Horrible service. We ordered the food, and waited at a nearby empty nearby booth. We couldn't sit in the waiting area because there were people sitting there already. We waited for about 20 minutes and the waitress behind the counter still didn't call our name. The people sitting in the waiting area left, so we moved there. We waited for a couple more minutes, and my mom went up to the waitress and asked if they were done with our food. The waitress asked for our name and checked a shelf under the counter in front of her. It turns out that the food had been sitting there for about 15 minutes. The waitress argued that since we weren't sitting at the waiting area, she didn't call our name. My mom told her that there were people sitting left and we moved there. The waitress just shrugged and didn't even offer a ""sorry"". My mom asked for some utensils and she only gave us one pack, even though we ordered three pizzas and one spaghetti. When we were leaving, the waitress caught up to us and put three small cups of sauce into the bag and said she forgot to give them to us. When we got home, we found out that she didn't place the cups right side up and were leaking all over the bag. The bag was stained with oil. The food portion is only average and way overpriced.                 Don't go there.

We had the patio to ourselves which was surprising as the evening was very pleasant. We were promptly seated and our waiter, Mikey, greeted us immediately and took our drink orders. He personally made our Long Island ice teas which, for the first time anywhere, were every bit as delicious as TGIF's recipe. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza which was cooked perfectly. Mikey was an outstanding waiter and was attentive without being overly so. CPK was smart to hire him. The only reason I did not give this establishment a 5 star rating is that the patio was in desperate need of a deep cleaning, mainly the tile floor needs a good streaming to erase all of the unappealing stains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.8240000000000003,3.1200000000000006

I also think the location has some factor on the price, it's a nice part of town so obviously it's a little bit more. The waitress I had was so sweet and caring, she had a great personality and wasn't forcing anything on us, that's a rare trait.

The last time I ate there I tried a shrimp alfredo and found the sauce a bit too watery and that the tails were left on the shrimp, which I'm not a fan of in pasta dishes. You're probably best just sticking to the pizzas; my go-to is the BBQ Chicken. Apparently there are some healthier options available on the menu as well, if that's your thing.

It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had and my father even enjoyed it, which says a lot because he is very picky. Our waitress Miranda M. was super great and delivered efficient and fast service. We will definitely be back again to enjoy CPK in Fresno the next time I'm in town! The vibe in CPK was very lively and enjoyable for both families and friends. 10/10 would recommend!

First to go item: The Thai Crunch salad in house is awesome-peanuts, veggies and rice sticks.    But.... when you get it to go and get all the away home- is doesn't have any peanuts and no veggies!! Second to go:  We ordered the salted caramel pudding and when we got it home, they had switched out the salted caramel pudding with hummus!!!   It made me so sick, I vomited and my husband was trying hard to not vomit.    They fooled us!    How could you not know that you're making the hummus look like a dessert?!  We called and spoke to the manager and he was indifferent about what happened to us.  He was so indifferent that it almost felt that it was a joke designed to ruin our experience.   Like immature staff playing a practical joke on a customer.  NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL!! So, beware when ordering food to go because it seems that there is a lack of proper supervision on the quality of the food being made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno,3.8,3.66,3.66,,3.716

4,Nicola B.,"Fresno, CA",656,517,1232.0,3.0,2017-07-05,"Had a quick Friday afternoon lunch with a friend last week and had a pleasant enough experience. We arrived at 1pm and there were only 2 free tables - the place was absolutely packed. Maybe because schools are out for summer? We were seated right away but service was pretty slow. Our waitress was friendly and acknowledged how busy it was and that there'd been a wait, so she was realistic with us.  I'd had pizza a couple of nights beforehand, so I ordered a lunch combo - half chicken club sandwich, half superfood salad. My friend got the BBQ chicken salad which she's had a few times and enjoys. My meal was filling - the superfood salad has some quinoa, walnuts, spinach, and cranberries. The sandwich was on a brioche roll, really sweet, it was sweeter than I usually enjoy but since it was just a half sandwich it balanced nicely with the salty bacon. Total with an iced tea and tip was $17 - more than I'd usually spend on lunch. It reminded me that this place is here and has pretty good food, though, so I'll probably come back for a pizza sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno,3.68,3.67,3.67,,3.6740000000000004
3,Greg S.,"Fresno, CA",56,282,372.0,2.0,2017-08-04,"The service is good here but the food isn't. It looks and sounds great on the menu but I've yet to get anything here that has been decent. This last round was a take-out order of dumplings or potstickers. At over $10.00, I received 6 mushy, jelly fish like, dumplings. The filling was chicken because they don't have pork. It's was pee gravel grainy and not moist and juicy inside. The dipping sauce was the star here, sweet and wonderfully spicy. My last meal here was a rip, too. So much so that it inspired my last disappointing, ho-hum, review. California Pizza Kitchen: The idea is always better than the reality and because they essentially skimp on EVERYTHING, it's a place I will not bother with again. I'm not a cheap person but neither will I tolerate the weak offering here and the lousy value.

Typically you would not except to have a long wait to get a table.  Some go-to items I like to get are the spinach artichoke dip, Kung pao spaghetti and the Sicilian pizza. The dip is my favorite appetizer and they usually give you extra chips if you find there are leftovers at the end. I usually get the spaghetti without any meats because they don't give much and it costs extra. The Sicilian pizza comes on a thin crust and I believe they charge extra if you prefer to have a thicker crust. It comes with Italian sausages, basil and salami",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno,3.76,3.63,3.63,,3.682
