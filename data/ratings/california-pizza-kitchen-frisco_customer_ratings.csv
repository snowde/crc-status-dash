Once one person acknowledged my presence, a couple more folks did as well. At that time, I was offered bread with olive oil on the side. Rather than get a beer or wine, I ordered the non-alcoholic Strawberry Mango Cooler. The combination of the photo and the description made the drink appear refreshing. For the first sip, you definitely taste the ginger. It overpowered the taste of the strawberries and mangoes in the drink and ended up being a strawberry/mango-infused ginger ale. When I opened the menu, I thought I entered the wrong door and ended up at a different restaurant. I expected to see the pizzas front and center. Some marketing genius thought it made sense to place the pizza choices on the inner flap. Because of the shift in focus, some of the exotic varieties are no longer listed. I decided on the Original BBQ Chicken with the wheat whole grain crust. At one time, the option used to be a honey wheat crust. Although it's the most expensive pizzas on the menu, I was asked if I wanted bacon on it. The combination of the BBQ sauce, red onions and cilantro gives the chicken and Gouda an unique taste. Why ruin a 30 year-old recipe by adding optional toppings? I enjoyed the pizza but I could've bought a similar pizza at my local grocery store.

130,Santanu S.,"Flower Mound, United States",15,144,75.0,3.0,2016-11-03,"decided to eat at the bar mistakenly believing the service would be quick. It took awhile before someone noticed me. Once one person acknowledged my presence, a couple more folks did as well. At that time, I was offered bread with olive oil on the side. Rather than get a beer or wine, I ordered the non-alcoholic Strawberry Mango Cooler. The combination of the photo and the description made the drink appear refreshing. For the first sip, you definitely taste the ginger. It overpowered the taste of the strawberries and mangoes in the drink and ended up being a strawberry/mango-infused ginger ale. When I opened the menu, I thought I entered the wrong door and ended up at a different restaurant. I expected to see the pizzas front and center. Some marketing genius thought it made sense to place the pizza choices on the inner flap. Because of the shift in focus, some of the exotic varieties are no longer listed. I decided on the Original BBQ Chicken with the wheat whole grain crust. At one time, the option used to be a honey wheat crust. Although it's the most expensive pizzas on the menu, I was asked if I wanted bacon on it. The combination of the BBQ sauce, red onions and cilantro gives the chicken and Gouda an unique taste. Why ruin a 30 year-old recipe by adding optional toppings? I enjoyed the pizza but I could've bought a similar pizza at my local grocery store. I was hoping for an unique experience that used to be offered, such as, Kung Pao pizza.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-frisco?start=20,3.36,3.08,3.08,2.54,3.1920000000000006

The waitress's response: ""oh, you wanted it before your pizzas?"" No apologies. Our pizzas came out, one of them was missing a slice. The waitress who pulled the pizza out of the oven took the initiative and said the kitchen was making another whole pizza to make up for the missing slice (which fell on the floor), which we were appreciative of! But it never came. We all finished, but still no pizza and our waitress completely forgot about it and blamed the kitchen. The place wasn't even busy, maybe for good reason.

Since the soup was not available and the only other option according to her was salad I asked if a small wedge was an option. She said no but would check with her manager since soup was not an option today. Great let me know so we can order accordingly and she walks away. The place is not that big so I watched her attentively since we are now 30 minutes into our wait and starting to get hungry. Again back to making drinks, serving a new family who sat down at the bar and cleaning glasses. Not once did she talk to anyone. Fast forward 10 minutes as I am now obviously staring at her and back she comes. Again no answer! Why because she didn't ask. By this time I am extremely agitated for goodness sakes it's a sandwich and salad not asking you to do something crazy. After I pointed out she was spending time cleaning glasses, helping other people and never talked to said manager she reluctantly agreed. We order and now 25 more minutes drinks empty, still no sandwich or salad and no sign of waitress! Finally the manager delivers our food only to be the wrong sandwich!

Damage to my pocket: $80 including taxes. Threw in $20 for tips. Total $100. This place doesn't accept reservation, but one hour ahead of time you can call to let them know....then I wonder what the purpose of telling them an hour ahead of time. We haven't been here in years....this place still looks and feels like it was 1999. It needs an update. There's hardly any decorations inside. The reason we came here was because even at 3.45pm, there was a long line at Cheesecake factory. Didn't want to wait there. Felt like in the past, they had more pizza toppings like duck, or something that resembles Chinese food (Teriyaki chicken topping). Was bummed they didn't have them any longer at this location. Can't help but think perhaps the customers here in TX aren't fond of Asian touch on their pizzas. Pizza size isn't big, they only have something that looks like medium to me. The crust is a little thin, I can't help but think what would their thin pizza be like? A big piece of cracker with toppings on it? For the BBQ one, I honestly like Domino's better. Service was good.
