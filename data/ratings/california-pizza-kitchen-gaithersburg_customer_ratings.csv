192,Tiffany G.,"Manassas, VA",10,14,,1.0,2012-01-29,"Made plans to see a movie at the nearby theater with two of my roommates on Saturday night. We wanted to snag dinner first, so we decided on CPK. We arrived 90 minutes before the movie, and were told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table. That still left us with over an hour for eating and making the two-minute walk to the theater, so we put our name down and settled in to wait. 30 minutes later, one of my roommates checked back in with the hostess, and was told it would be another 5-10 minutes. We were getting tight on time at this point, but didn't have time to go wait somewhere ELSE, so we stayed put. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind waiting for a table, but be HONEST about how long the wait will take in case people have plans -- especially if you're located right by a movie theater, and you KNOW you get a lot of the pre-movie crowds. We were finally seated 40 minutes after our arrival. We had asked for a menu to look over during our wait, so we all knew what we wanted, and ordered both our drinks and our meal when our server came came to the table. Our server brought the drinks right away, and a runner brought our food about 15 minutes later. The delivery of the drinks was the last time we saw our server until we managed to flag him down from across the room when we were entirely done with the meal to request our check. He never bothered to stop by to check on our food, no refills (we ALL had empty glasses), nothing. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but that's no excuse for totally IGNORING a table. The food itself was ok, but nothing special (and certainly not worth waiting for). I had the Pesto Chicken thin crust pizza, and there was so little pesto on it that if I hadn't known it was supposed to be there, I probably would have missed it. the chicken was a bit dried out, too. It felt more like something I'd get from Dominos than something that I'd consider restaurant-quality. My rooommates had a pasta dish (I'm not sure exactly which one, but he said it wasn't bad) and a Jamaican Jerk pizza (I tasted a slice -- again, not bad, but dried-out chicken just like my pizza, and again, felt more like delivery pizza than restaurant pizza). I've been to other CPKs in the past, but have not been to one for some time now, so I have no idea if the overall quality/service standards have fallen for the whole chain, or if this is just a subpar location. Either way, I won't be coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-gaithersburg?start=160,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6280000000000006,3.2000000000000006

Their BBQ pizza with honey wheat crust is really good. I remember having their turkey sandwich once, but I didn't like it because the Dijon mustard overpowered everything about the sandwich. I couldn't even finish it! The last two times I've gone I've had the fish taco once and the next time I had the steak. Both were really good and flavorful. with a squirt of lemon, it added pizazz to each taco. I've also had their Red Velvet cake for dessert and it was wonderful.

She did not show concern, shock or any empathy. The manager came over and identified the plastic piece. She also lacked empathy and asked if my co-worker wanted to order something else on the house.  The reaction of the staff was as if this type of thing happens all the time. They comped my co-workers salad. A bit more concern should have been expressed.

124,Phil C.,"Potomac, MD",1,15,,2.0,2012-06-24,"CPK diet tip -- adding lettuce to any dish DECREASES the calories! So I went to CPK with a group of friends from work for lunch, and we noticed that the standard (as opposed to thin crust) pizzas appeared smaller than last time. We asked the server, and he said the pizza size had not changed -- fair enough, our perception could be tricked by plate size or other variables. Later, I checked online (I'm pedantic, I know) and saw that the California Club Pizza I order dropped from 1560 calories in 2010 ( ), to 1515 in 2011 ( ), and now down to 1400. So, again I inquired, this time via CPK's website, relevant excerpts below: CPK: We have not made any changes to our sizes of our pizzas.  They are still 10"" round six slices each pizza. ME: I'm still curious -- do you know anything about the calorie count dropping from 1560 to 1400 for the california club pizza? In 2010 it was 1560 calories ( ), in 2011 it was 1515 ( ), and now it's down to 1400. CPK: The only thing that has changed recently in the recipe is the amount of lettuce.  There is more lettuce now on the pizza. So adding lettuce decreases the calorie count?

The Mushroom, Sausage, and Pepperoni pizza was severely under cooked.  The crust was doughy but the top was well cooked.  Not sure, maybe it was in the wrong part of the oven.   My youngest got a kids cheese pizza and devoured it so she seemed happy.  Not much to say about the salad.  It's a chopped salad, well dressed, and the deli meets are finely shredded.  Not a stand out but fine. Our server was attentive, kept the kids drinks full, and was there when we needed him.  No issues, at all.

I placed my order online, which is quick and easy to do.  I was thrilled to see that the location in Gaithersburg RIO has parking spaces allotted for curbside pickup (according to their website).     When I arrived on a Sunday around 4:45pm, there was NO parking available.  The parking spots designated for curbside pickup were all taken by people who were NOT there for the curbside pickup, because no one was inside those vehicles.   There was no parking along the side area or on the street, so I went around the block (which was not quick due to all the people walking about).    I finally pulled into the area next to potbelly (which is a pseudo alley/dead end).   I called to tell the host my location, and he assured me that my food would be right out (by this time, I am late picking up my order).    I waited about 10 minutes, and then called back again.  This time a female answered and said it would be out shortly.   It finally arrived, I tipped the host, and started to drive away and thought I should glance in the bag.   I had 2 friends back at my place and we were going to share the tricolore pizza salad, bread, and split a pudding.    I saw that they forgot the bread.   ugggh.   I called back to tell them  and suddenly, he claimed that we had a bad phone connection.   Ok, so  I repeated it several times, and told him that I am driving around the block again.  When I made it back to the place, there was a spot available in front of the restaurant.   It was another 7 minutes, and finally he came running out with a small baggie with these tiny pieces of 1"" diameter bread.   It looked like they cut a baguette.   What happened to the good bread that CPK always served?  Of course there were 3 of us, and now we have 4 tiny pieces of bread to share.    After I arrived home and took the salad out of the bag, I noticed that the plastic container was about 1/3 full.   The pizza crust was as hard as a rock.   The pudding looked sad.  I was embarassed to share this sad meal with my friends, especially after I highly recommended CPK to them.

When my friend and I both ordered a glass of White Zif our waiter suggested we order a bottle and take whatever we didn't drink home.  With the price per glass versus a bottle we agreed it was a good idea.  Since my granddaughter was spending the night with us, I figured the odds of my having pizza for dinner were pretty high, so reluctantly I opted for a bowl of Tortilla soup instead of one of their pizzas.  It was rich and creamy and I couldn't even finish the bowl.  My friend ordered a sautéed veggie salad.  It looked good and she claimed all their salads were delicious.  Our waiter was perfect In checking on us occasionally, but obviously realizing we had settled in for a lot of chatting, not rushing us.   The menu had a lot more choices than just pizza.  A bowl of pasta and a pizza that went past us while we ate both looked good.  I will go back again and look forward to exploring the menu a little bit more.  And I will look forward to enjoying another glass of White Zif while enjoying the view of the lake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-gaithersburg?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.184,3.4400000000000004

139,Kat B.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,2.0,2014-10-18,"The hostess first attempted to seat us at a booth sandwiched between the kitchen entrance and a very large party in corner booth (like 8 people) when there were plenty of other tables available. She seemed way more annoyed than she should have been when I politely asked if we could sit a few tables down (still adjacent to other customers also). I didn't see what the big deal was but she acted almost personally offended.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful and attentive; she seemed newer. She was very accommodating for all our requests, although we felt rather rushed immediately... we were seated about 40 minutes before closing. As soon as she took our drink orders, she asked if we were ready to order our food. Bad sign. She mentioned how the kitchen was ""wrapping things up"" and that there was only a little bread left, which we requested immedately. I mean... really? Their own advertised hours are until 11pm on a Friday night, and there was a minimum of 20 other tables in all areas of the restaurant still seated. They're wrapping up? We didn't walk in 10 minutes before closing; we walked in 40 minutes before closing.  That brings me to my biggest complaint. Only 30 minutes after their advertised closing time I wasn't able to even order a ready-made dessert TO GO because ""the kitchen would flip out"". Restaurants shouldn't be ""OPEN"" until 10pm or 11pm if they're going to shut down the kitchen exactly at closing time. Nobody can order and eat dinner in five minutes. If a place isn't not willing to actually serve customers a full menu for a normal amount of dinner time, then close at 10:30. Close at 10:00. Don't say ""We're open until 11pm"" and tell me the kitchen will flip out at 11:29 if I want to order a dessert to go. It's not like they even would have had to make anything. Cut a slice of pie/cake, plop it in a box, done. Nope, apparently at 11:29pm, that was just too much for them. I wish our server had at least given us notice about it so we could have ordered earlier or something. It wasn't her fault that the kitchen staff was apparently going to bite her head off (she seemed almost nervous at the thought, as she mentioned that another table had requested something TEN MINUTES EARLIER and the kitchen gave her a really hard time about that also). So... apparently CPK only wants your money if you can get in there an hour before closing and be completely finished your meal so they can all go home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-gaithersburg?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8880000000000003,3.4800000000000004

Let's start by talking about the base. The texture itself was pretty good, soft and fluffy in the centre with a crusty edge. However, the taste let it down somewhat, it was just a tad flavourless and bland. Luckily the toppings made up for the bases shortcomings.  My partner had the avocado, salad, chicken, bacon pizza. The toppings on his were amazing. He said the base was good too. I went for the mango nonfat yoghurt smoothie. It was delicious, plentiful and comparable to any good mango lassi.

My mother ordered a chicken dish with the sauce on the side. When the food was brought out, the sauce was not on the side. What I thought odd was that the young woman who brought the food acknowledged that the food was prepared incorrectly and basically asked my mom if she just wanted to eat it anyway or if she wanted them to fix the mistake. So, they knew it was wrong and rather than fix the problem in the kitchen, they took a shot at just serving it anyway. We asked that the food be repaired as requested, so they took it back and left me with my food and the uncomfortable choice of eating it while my mom waited for her food or letting it sit and get cold.

Our server Sandy was friendly, helpful, polite, and professional. For drinks, my mom and I got freshly brewed, unsweetened iced tea but I decided to add a flavor, I had the choice among peach, mango, strawberry, and raspberry, and eventually picked Raspberry. We shared a salad, a dinner entree, and pizza.  Instead of trying a salad from the menu, we decided to try the seasonal feature: Harvest Kale Salad without goat cheese, which consisted of baby kale, toasted farro, roasted butternut squash, Napa cabbage, shaved pear, marinated cranberries, and spiced pecans tossed with spicy and tangy citrus vinaigrette. When I asked for extra dressing on the side, the dressing was much thicker and stronger in taste than I expected. The Hearth Roasted Halibut and The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza stole the night.

Despite the restaurant being fairly empty, the bar service was really slow.  I mean, so slow, that 5 of us were able to get seats at the bar sitting next to each other, slow.  We waited a long while for our bartender/server to even acknowledge us.  When he finally came, I assume we looked like we weren't as ready as he liked, so he moved on and started doing something else. We waited some more. Finally got to put in our orders, both drinks and food.  Drinks came fairly quickly, but 30 mins later, still no food.  So, I asked nicely... ""just wondering, are our orders coming out soon?  We're super hungry."" He says ""oh you want me to put your food orders in?"" I have no words for what I was thinking at that point. Apparently, he thought we were waiting for more people and wanted to wait.  However, we're at the bar... on separate checks... why would we wait??? Anywho, we planned to leave at that point, but some more coworkers showed up, so we decided to stay. Another server took over for us and we were way happier.  Our food came fairly quickly after that.

Sweet because the new look and atmosphere has done wonders on service efficiency and mood boosting energy.  But tonight i was truly disappointed. The managerial service is always accommodating and considerate as he has always been. But our waiters were just subpar, unwelcoming and not so considerate. don't even get me started on how we had to wait to order. yes, it was busy. but i have seen CPK BUSIER and still be able to be efficient. Not only did a drink come with a dead bug (Dont worry it was just water, but still just as uncomfortable). The menu didn't really impress me as it did before. Some things changed and were added to it, it didn't give off a good group feel that i was hoping for tonight. I thought bringing a group out to eat at CPK would be a good choice but it wasn't all i thought it would be. Too bad my fav restaurant at rio is closed, leaves me with limited choices as to where to eat when i want to hang out with a few friends. Food? you ask? Simple tasting and moderately satisfying. literally all we wanted was pizzas to share together, but i guess it's better to order pizza at home. might think i'm pretty harsh, but let's just say the levels of disappointment is very high considering the fact that i have visited CPK so often i had confidence that it would be a good eating experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-gaithersburg?start=60,3.48,3.35,3.35,2.472,3.402

24,Nneka M.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",80,121,191.0,2.0,2016-07-26,"Oh no!! My first ""2 star"" review!! I ordered two large catering-sized orders of avocado club egg rolls for a potluck lunch at work held for a fellow employee, who is relocating out of state. I called and place my order with CPK a full 24hours in advance, and I specifically asked if it could be delivered between 11:30-11:45am the next day. They also notified me that there is a $10.00 delivery fee.  CPK called me at 10:30am on the day of delivery and confirmed my ordered, took my credit card payment over the phone, and verified that my food would be promptly delivered at 11:45am. By 11:50am, I called CPK to see if the delivery driver was at least on the way, only to be told that my order was not even ""ready"" yet, but it would be delivered in 10mins. Of course, I questioned how my order was not ready when someone called me over an hour ago confirming my order. Also, with the typical 270 lunch hour traffic, my job is over 15 mins away from CPK, so how would my order be here in 10 mins if it is not even ""done"". Im very disappointed in the service and as a result, I ended up canceling my order. If they knew they were running behind, I would have appreciated 'a heads up' instead of having me stand outside for 10 mins thinking my food was about to arrive. And when they promised to be there within 10mins, I had a strange feeling they were just saying that to appease me.  Overall, I don't recommend their catering services..but if you do decide to chance it, try to pick up your order instead OR just pay on delivery, cause once they had my $85+ payment, I felt like I was their puppet :( And they better have money!! (shout out to Rihanna) BTW..I gave 2 stars (instead of 1) cause I met with a manager later on that night who apologized for the service and comped an appetizer order of avocado club egg rolls.

If you've ever taken leftover alfredo home, you know what happens when you reheat it? The creaminess is gone and you have kind of a butter/cheese split? Yup, that's what we were served. That is not a sauce worthy of any restaurant. Incredibly disappointing. The pizza was fantastic in comparison.  That's the only reason I'll offer up one extra star.

Our waiter was probably 22 or 23, but acted like he was 13. He was a nice kid, but tries to make INCREDIBLY awkward conversation and is just so odd. Also, my friend told him that we needed just another minute to decide and he didn't come back for at least another 10 minutes.  We had noticed that all other tables were given bread as soon as they were seated, but we weren't and had to ask for it as we were ordering our entrees. By the time we ordered and got our food, we had probably already been there for 40 minutes.  I ordered the chicken tequila pasta. The sauce/flavor was delicious, but my fettuccine pasta was SO UNDERCOOKED I was mind blown that they'd serve it. I don't know who the chef was, but anyone who has ever had pasta in their lives could tell that it was super undercooked just by looking at it. All of the noodles were so stiff and it felt like I was eating cardboard noodles. All of my colleagues were surprised by it too. I didn't want to send it back because we only had an hour for lunch and sending it back and getting a new one would've taken too long, so I just ate it. The sauce made it kind of bearable, but I'm still shocked the chef couldn't tell the pasta noodles were undercooked.

5,Connie L.,"Germantown, MD",132,237,668.0,3.0,2017-01-18,"I came here on a Monday afternoon around 1 to pick up lunch to go. I got the lunch duo with a mushroom/pepperoni/sausage pizza and the Mediterranean salad. In a moment of poor planning, I ordered at the restaurant rather than ordering online ahead of time. I was told my food would be ready in 10-15 minutes, but really my wait wound up being closer to 30 minutes. While I was waiting, I had a pretty clear view of the kitchen area and could see that my pizza was ready several minutes before my salad and wound up sitting in a box for awhile before my order was done; as a result, my pizza was rather soggy by the time I got to eat it. Other than the sogginess, the pizza was delicious and had a generous amount of toppings and herbs. The salad was also tasty and a good size. The restaurant was pretty busy when I was there, given it was lunch rush hour; it was also MLK day so there might have been more people dining in if they were off work. The interior of the restaurant is pretty big; there is also a bar. There's a designated area for picking up takeout orders near the back of the restaurant, and you can order there too (although again, I'd recommend ordering online). The pick-up entrance is right by the Potbelly entrance.  Overall, I enjoyed the food, but the wait was longer than I'd expected and did damage my experience a bit. The restaurant is very conveniently located; there is free parking and a lot of shopping nearby, as well as the movie theater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-gaithersburg,2.8,3.27,3.27,2.8280000000000003,3.082

29,Ian E.,"Germantown, MD",8,9,1.0,5.0,2017-04-24,"I am very pleased with my experience at this CPK location. The food, service, ambience, and location were all great! I highly recommend and I'm surprised to see fewer than five stars.  Detailed version: My wife, six-year-old son, and I were looking for lunch on Sunday (April 23rd) at around 1:15. We tried a different restaurant a few minutes away but when there was no one at the host stand and another guest tried to help get us seated (I kid you not) we left that restaurant and were delighted to see that Google Maps showed a CPK nearby.  We came in and were seated promptly even though the place was packed. We were served drinks and our appetizer (chicken dumplings) quickly. Our waitress was super-friendly and helpful. When ordering lunch, we asked if our son could be given pasta Alfredo with a different type of pasta than was on the menu. Our son has special needs and, despite our best efforts, he won't eat ""curly pasta"" or ""pasta with ridges on it"" (spare me your lecture, he has developmental delays and we're working on it). The waitress said (happily) that she'd see what could be done. We ordered the potato soup as a backup. She came back promptly and said it was definitely doable. The pasta was good and he ate it with not too much trouble. My wife ordered a pizza with no cheese (due to a dairy allergy) and the waitress barely batted an eye. Her pizza was perfect (how a pizza without cheese can be perfect is beyond my understanding, but CPK pulled it off). My pizza was superb as always. I mentioned to my wife that in the fifteen years we've been eating at various CPK locations, we've never had a bad experience. She agreed. We left afterwards and had a lovely time wandering around the Rio.  So, again, I highly recommend this CPK location. Not only are the food, service, ambience, and location great, but I'd consider this restaurant to be ""allergy friendly"" and, most importantly for our family, ""special-needs friendly"" based on how helpful they were.

I have observed over the past few years that the portion size is getting smaller (like everywhere else), but last night's amount of chicken stood out to me immediately as soon as it was put down in front of me. When I scooped all the chicken out to the side of the plate, I think there were about 5 pieces and each piece was about the size of the top section of my index finger. I didn't want to ask for more chicken because it was peak time for dinner and I didn't want to bother the server or the kitchen. Hopefully, next time my dish will have more chicken.
