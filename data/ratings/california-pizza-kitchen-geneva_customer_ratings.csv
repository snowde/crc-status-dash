42,Dave A.,"Geneva, IL",0,13,,1.0,2012-06-08,"I've had good experiences here, and my family enjoys the food, but not this time.  The service was AWFUL.  Our waitress's name was Kat. Lets see.... Kat: - did not check back to see how we were doing. - disappeared for 15 minutes.  I found the manager and complained.  She appeared in front of him and said ""I'm right here"".  Manager did nothing - no apology. - continued to ignore our table - did not ask if we wanted bread.  When we finally got it, the pizzas came one minute later - forgot two drink refill requests - complained about not knowing the computer system, not being able to find the manager - Made us wait forever for everything.  There were tables all around us (with different waitstaff) who got there after us and left before us. - Did not ask if we wanted dessert (one came free because one of our kids is in the birthday club).  We left because we couldn't stand the wait and being ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=20,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002

Now, I am disappointed with the statement on the menu where it says we now offer Gluten Free Piazza's, I will never feel comfortable ordering an item that says it is gluten free when it is prepared in the same area with gluten items. I went here because I had just 3 hours at T-Mobile stuff and my Blood Sugar was low. I had a coupon for a Free Quinoa & Argula Salad which only comes with 1/2 ounce of protein, I order chicken on it and just charged $4 for 4 oz of chicken which I think is way overpriced and then they were going to charge me extra subbing the feta cheese with mozzaella, just wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=40,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

Try as I did, I couldn't pull the steering wheel away from her so in we went.  I ordered the half Cobb salad and I gotta say, it was pretty darn good. Liberal with the ingredients (including beets! Mmmm dirt cherries) and not a shred of iceberg lettuce was seen. The piece of my sister's taco pizza that I had was...interesting. Beans instead of red sauce, chips and lettuce, some cheese and tomatoes, etc. It was ok. I'm a pizza and taco purist so I would never order that, but I was very content with my salad and a half is good for a meal with no leftovers, especially if you nom on the bread they bring.

41,Samantha M.,"Carpentersville, IL",2,17,18.0,4.0,2013-07-18,"My boyfriend and I just went here the other night for dinner. We got a hummus appetizer which was delicious. I got a shrimp fettuccine dish which was also delicious and my boyfriend got some sort of Hawaiian pizza. He said the pizza was very good. The only thing that was a little bothersome about it is I felt the wine was a bit overpriced. Of course, because it's alcohol, there's not prices on the menu but I ordered two glasses of wine and they ended up being $10 a piece. I thought for the rest of CPK's prices, that was a bit much. However, that being said, the wine was very good. I may have still ordered two glasses... just would've liked to not have been so blind sided by the price. My boyfriend got a beer, a pretty large blue moon, and that was only $6, so I guess there's balance. Our waiter was excellent, and all said and done our bill was about $65 for two people. A little bit much, I thought, for a place that is supposed to be pretty casual.

40,Kerry B.,"Plainfield, IL",51,34,7.0,4.0,2013-07-28,"What an experience!!!   We were seated immediately by the friendly male host and within seconds our server came to greet us.  My friend and I eat dinner out a lot and have experienced some not so good wait staff.  Our server, Gabby, on the other hand was such a delight!  She was polite, she was patient with our order, answered our silly questions, she was very attentive (but not hovering) in case we needed a refill or extra napkins, she inquired with the bartender about a special drink that my friend wanted that wasn't on the menu and the best part....she actually smiled!  That's rare these days.  She genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  If I were basing this review just on Gabby, I would definitely give her five stars. But, we also ate.  We ordered the Thai Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  While we were waiting for them Gabby brought us out bread and oil.  We were starving so we scarfed that right down.  Pretty good!  When the spring rolls came out, a few of them had been singed in the oven.  Disappointing but not a big deal.  The peanut sauce that came with the rolls tasted like melted down peanut butter.  It wasn't the best sauce I've eaten, it needs some more spice.  Otherwise, the spring rolls were tasty and fulfilled a slight thai craving I was having. We ordered the Veggie Pizza with no mushrooms, added the goat cheese and with Gabby's suggestion, went with the whole wheat crust.  It was pretty decent.  I loved the addition of the goat cheese, gave it a nice tart little kick.  The only thing I would change about the pizza would be to put just a few more toppings on.  I think there was one piece of eggplant on the entire pizza. Overall this was a 5 star experience, soley based on the excellent service and attention of Gabby, but had to drop off a star for the food, I mean, it's a chain restaurant, not a 5 star gourmet establishment.  Also because when we asked to speak to a manager to compliment Gabby on her job well done, all he did was try to push their survey on us, basically begging us to call into the number and give them all a good review.  It was kind of awkward and we left not knowing if the manager was even going to let Gabby know how great she was. 4 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=20,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

1,Rachel W.,"Elgin, IL",112,180,52.0,4.0,2017-06-30,"Typical CPK food. It's good for a chain. I've always enjoyed it but now I try not to go to chain restaurants as much. However I do love their BBQ Chicken pizza. It's always been a favorite. They service was good, food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
7,Ben B.,"Geneva, IL",50,11,,5.0,2017-09-15,The pizza is okay. In my mind it's not really pizza but have you tried there desserts there fantastic. I have tried every one of there deserts and I can't pick a favorite. Oh and the people that work there are super cool. Definitely go in there to get an awesome desert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
0,Andy G.,"Batavia, IL",19,169,40.0,4.0,2017-10-04,"I have upped my rating of CPK because I like their rotating specials. Awhile ago they had a Korean pizza which was particularly good. I especially like how the toppings and/or ingredients creatively adhere to whichever theme is being portrayed. One downside is that if you really do like a special it will eventually be replaced by a new one. However, the new special is usually just as good keeping the dining experience fresh. Right now an ancho chili short rib panini or chicken meatball panini is featured. This is one of the best specials I have ever had and I will be sorry to see it go (sad face). The lunch duos are a good deal. This is a choice of a small salad and a small pizza available for a little over ten dollars. The chain feeling is still strong for me, but these specials make a difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
