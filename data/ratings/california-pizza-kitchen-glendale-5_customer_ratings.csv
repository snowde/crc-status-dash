0,Sadie T.,"Milwaukee, WI",166,391,25.0,4.0,2012-01-03,"I consider CPK a higher end chain restaurant with more selection and better ingredients.  Our waitress was very busy, she told us she was also the bartender and waiting on a whole other set of tables. Because of her workload, she only once refilled waters (which had to be requested, and she looked absolutely exhausted when I asked for waters for all 9 of us). This is management's failing. Overall the food is good. There is a really wide variety of options of pretty classic American Italian food (pizza, white pasta, etc) with some variations. If you are in the mood for middle of the line fare, this is a nice place for you! I like the variety of salads, too. The half field greens salad I had was very good, but too heavy on the dressing. The white pizza was pretty good too, but much more bland than I was expecting.  I like the decor. It has a casual upscale feel. I would recommend, which I don't often say for chains as I prefer to buy local.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5,,,,,
