42,Andrew B.,"Brookfield, WI",9,15,,4.0,2012-07-11,"Food was good had pasta with clams, only 5 clams though. My wife had the chicken caesar sandwich, it was very tasty and pretty good sized. My daughter is a purest, she went for the meat loaded pizza, she loved it. Portions were good sized so yes we had leftovers to enjoy later that night. Staff was a bit slow, but she was a kid and probably learning, so she gets some slack.

At first I thought it would be hard for us to choose which pizza to order (Jake and I have totally opposite tastes in pizza) BUT we both agreed immediately on everything! Miraculous. :) For an appetizer, we ordered the Tuscan Hummus plate with traditional pita bread. Very delicous. For our entree, we ordered the Pesto Chicken thin crust pizza. No exaggeration- best pizza I've ever had! Perfect balance of flavors, and the crust had just the right amount of crispness. For dessert, we ordered the Apple Crisp. YUMMY!! I particularly liked the crumbly crust. Plenty for 2-3 people to share. And all for only $32!!  The only negative thing during our visit- the women's bathroom was messy, and both stalls were out of toilet paper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6?start=20,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

My husband and I stop there occasionally while we are shopping at Bayshore Town Center.  My favorite appetizer is the foccacia bread with olive oil dipping sauce. You order by the person, it is only 2.50 per serving.  The staff has always been friendly and prompt.  It is child friendly, I would bring my our year old there and she wouldn't be out of place.  They have a wide selection of pizza. My favorite is the pear and gorgonzola. What could be bad with gorgonzola on it, right! Otherwise, try the original BBQ chicken pizza.  The noise level is a little high, but that adds to its family friendliness, if the noise level is high enough no one will notice my daughter's occasional outburst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

The atmosphere is fun and trendy, and the menu is solid. Their salads are really unique (I love the roasted vegetable), the pizza portion of the menu is extensive and has something for everyone, and the pastas feel really indulgent.

37,Heidi R.,"Madison, WI",4,19,,2.0,2013-05-01,"We've been to CPK many times before in a variety of locations, so this review is only in regards to this location in the metro Milwaukee area--other locations may or may not be as ""meh."" As I've said, we've been to CPKs many times in the past; however, it's been some months since we've been and the menu changed. I get that happens, but it's still annoying when the one thing you like is gone. It was a chicken/basil pizza. We were able to get something that was similar, so that was okay. We ordered a pizza and a salad to share with the understanding that we'd get the salad and then the pizza. We ordered this way many times like this, so we were surprised when both came out at the same time. The young woman who brought our dinner was not our server, so she just assumed that I got the salad and then she stuck an entire pizza in front of my husband. Bad assumption. And that sort of assumption leads to customers feeling a little less appreciated. If one doesn't know, why not ask? Additionally, the pizza was warm, but not hot--so we felt compelled to eat it first, lest it cool off completely, and then we only picked at the salad. Since we don't live in the area, taking it home was not going to work.  Additionally, the music was SO loud, I almost felt like I used to when I went to a concert--deaf afterwards. I would've tried to get the server to lower the volume, but she didn't come back to check on us until the meal was nearly complete.  I don't think we'll be going back at least to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6?start=20,3.1120000000000005,3.1120000000000005,3.1120000000000005,3.1120000000000005,3.112000000000001

I love their pizza :)  I started with a giant Stella, and ended with the asian plum martini. Martini was extremely sweet, but if you like that sort of thing, it was delicious.  I started with the hummus and it was really good too. I love warm pita bread. For pizzas we got the California Club and the Pear and Gorgonzola. I always go for the Five Cheese and Fresh Tomato, which is just absolutely fantastic. Nice blend of cheese and the fresh julienned basil really tops it off. I liked the pear and gorgonzola almost as much - the arugula on top was a nice touch. I thought the Club had a few too many cold ingredients on the top, but it was pretty good as well.  I really like Andi the bartender, she takes care of us.  The best part of this place may be the bathroom - it has a shelf for purses in the stall!

We ordered a small arugula salad, and a mushroom flatbread to start. Also had the white wine sangria. Then came the entrees, Chinese chicken salad and a chicken Caesar sandwich. Both were good. My girlfriend ordered a blue moon tap beer after the meal, and when we got up to leave she immediately felt sick and vomited up the entire meal within 15 seconds of leaving the establishment. There must have been something bad either in the tap beer or in the Chinese chicken salad, because those are the only two items I did not try, and I was not sick.

Pineapple added perfect sweetness and the applewood smoked ham gave a robust taste that paired well with the thin crust and cheese.  I can't believe I have not tried this place before now but they have def made a customer out of me.

The good ol' classic BBQ chicken pizza is always a go to & the avocado rolls as an appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84
4,Aimee M.,"CA, CA",3,53,147.0,3.0,2017-01-08,"I went there with my friend for lunch once.  We got Lunch Duos. I ordered it with THE ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA, and my friend ordered a SHAVED MUSHROOM + SPINACH. You will get 7"" size of the pizza with it. Mine was a little strong flavor for me, maybe too sweet?? I prefer that my friend orderd. I like the thin pizza and I think the size was better than the regular size. We got a BUTTER CAKE for dessert to share. It was big and we couldn't eat it all. That was a really American size and so sweet. The service and the price was good. That's a good place for family. It's a big restaurant so my friend took her daughter. There is so many menus so it was a difficult decision for me, but was fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92

1,Melanie L.,"Muskego, WI",25,245,232.0,5.0,2017-10-24,"Carne Assad's steak pizza is back this month! They serve it with a bitter salad verde vs the old chimichurri  and salsa combo. It's not as good as it used to be but still a great menu choice.  Although Pizza used to be the main focus, CPK has expanded their menu over the years to include more pasta dishes, soups, salads and main courses of fish, chicken and steak.  This location in Bayshore Mall is fantastic. It's right near the parking garage and easy access to all the shops. The restaurant is pretty spacious and even has outdoor seating available.  Every time I've visited I've been treated well by attentive staff.  It's always very clean inside and the food tastes great. I'd highly recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0

My meal consisted of the traditional wedge salad with extra chunky blue cheese dressing in the side and the chicken Milanese.  The wedge salad was a well portioned start to my meal. The makeup being quite traditional with bacon, tomato, and blue cheese dressing - a combination, in my most humble opinion, that can't be beat. It was delicious! Next was my main, the chicken Milanese topped with a heavenly micro greens salad and a fresh lemon half ready fo squeezing. The combination of panko covered chicken with the lemony field salad was excellent in taste, texture and portion size. Highly recommended! The server, Asia, was quick, courteous and knowledgeable about the full menu and was not hesitant to offer her recommendations - a very nice gesture on her part. The food arrived in a timely manner and presented in an appetizing way.  Overall I give this dinning experience a full two thumbs up and will be making another trip to sample some of their other offerings in the very near future!  Well done California Pizza and Asia - you've impressed me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0
3,Mike G.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,2.0,5.0,2017-12-16,"Outstanding Pizza! I'm aware of ""value"" pizza chains out there, and they are good for takeout or delivery. However, when I'm in the mood to sit in a restaurant and eat a crispy but chewy top of the line pizza I come here. ( I recommend the Sicilian on handtossed crust). The service is great, staff are polite and quick to ensure beverages are replenished. Although the only criticism I have, is that it seems the customers have to ask for the delicious but complimentary bread and oil.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,4.12,4.12,4.12,,4.12

But digress. The food here is pretty good. If you add sides and drinks on top of pizza the tab runs up in a hurry. The staff at this location is usually pretty good, but I've had a couple of experiences where the staff completely disappears once the main dishes are served only to return to get boxes and the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-6,4.08,4.08,4.08,,4.08
