113,Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61.0,3.0,2012-03-08,"Im a fan of this place. I would normally not suggest going here but when my friends do I dont disagree.  Been here for lunch and dinner many years ago and I dont remember what I ate, but I do remember the pizza being on the smaller side and it was just ok.  What I do remember is recently when I had the : Roasted Vegetable (friends suggestion). It was good, A lot of food for a salad, and it was very delicious!  California Club. Really well made..  tasted just like any other California chicken club Chocolate Soufflé Cake... YUUUMMY, very good.. too bad us 3 got 1 to share! that was a mistake we will never repeat again.  Our work orders food from CPK regularly, not specifically from this location but their pasta is pretty good, and the bbq chicken pizza is not bad either.  Lets just say Im a fan! =] but since I wouldnt choose to go here myself I cant give them 4 stars...  p.s. at this location sit by the window makes your dining experience much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=140,3.72,3.35,3.35,3.1480000000000006,3.498
413,Rizzy V.,"Glendale, United States",250,8,12.0,4.0,2012-03-26,"I felt compelled to write a review for this place following tonight's meal because the experience was just that memorable enough for me.  We were a party of 6 adults with 3 children all 5 years and under, yet we were seated promptly. You would expect it to be packed on a Saturday night, but for some reason--maybe the Olive Garden downstairs took more of their customers this evening, who knows--we got lucky. I like that this location sits on the second floor because they have panoramic windows that wrap around the building so you have the view of downtown Glendale. It makes for a very picturesque background instead of just plain old walls. Really nice, especially if you're out on a date. ;)  We didn't wait too long for our server, who's name was Del. And what I've noticed about most members' experiences, it really all depends on who your server is for that night. Let me tell you, ours was awesome! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about him. If I could rate this based on service and quality of food alone, I would have given it five stars, BUT, I can't be too generous just yet. First things first, Del got our drink orders and let us know that if we wanted to add appetizers he'd be happy to wait for us to make our decisions. And with a group, it's almost guaranteed that this process takes a while. He was really patient and very friendly, always quick with the 'You got it!' or 'Don't worry, I got you' that really sets the tone of the whole restaurant, one that is upbeat and positive.  My two children ordered a small cheese pizza off of the children's menu, which they shared. And two slices is just right for little ones who don't eat very much so that was good. Some of my friends ended up with a variety of pizzas, pasta dishes, and salads. Del brought out this habanero salsa to add to the salads that significantly amped the flavor. We loved it! It definitely made a difference! I ordered the chicken tequila lime fettucine. It was a toss-up between that and the asparagus and spinach spaghettini, which I told him I was planning to get. He suggested the first, so I got that. Our drinks came right away, I love the different types of teas you can choose from. Mine was a mango iced-tea, really delicious and refreshing! And they have free refills! One of my friends ordered tea and later when she asked for more hot water, he gave her an extra bag! How nice is that?! Before our food arrived, we got bread and butter on the house while we waited for our order.  Strike 1: Okay, now this is partly the reason for the missing star. I mean, what happened to their bread?  It tasted like old bread crumbs. Not even dipping it in the vinegar and olive oil or slapping butter on it helped. Not the kind of quality bread I've been accustomed to when I've eaten at CPK in the past. Good thing our food came out right away. My chicken tequila lime fettucine was ALL THAT. I don't think they could have improved it in any way...okay, after I added another wedge of lemon zest to it did it taste complete, but it was perfect! I ate EVERY. BITE. I seriously didn't leave anything on the plate. :) I was really glad I went with that order.   Strike 2: If I had gone with order option #2 and wanted to add chicken, it would have been $4.00 extra, or sauteed mushrooms, would have been $1.00  REALLY? A dollar extra for some shrooms?? Get outta here! So what might have been an $11.00 meal could have easily turned into $16.00. Geez. They're lucky they had fantastic service, not to mention our group is the 'hearty' type with lots of conversations, laughter and a young toddler just beginning to learn table manners, leaving a garden of uneaten food underneath the table. We left that place a mess! Thanks for your patience CPK! Our bill came out to a total of $130ish..not bad for all the stuff we ate and drank!   Keep up the good work and give that server, Del a raise, he's got awesome serving and people skills!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=200,3.76,3.35,3.35,3.2800000000000002,3.5140000000000002

Portions are kind of smaller than before even tough they say that it's the same amount because it's measured by ounces, but I really don't buy that. Prices are ok for what they give, but it could be better, like before. I guess all this economy thing affected the chain that bad too, but to that point? I think people would be able to pay a little bit extra for what it should be. Service is ok, not the best service but just ok.

Plus, even the menu itself was laminated or inside a kind of a leather cover before, now it's just a piece of printed carton...so cheap looking. They do not give butter for the appetizer bread like they did before, now (and only upon request) they give you small pieces of butter that they cut and bring from the kitchen ingredients from cooks....really? Portions are kind of smaller than before even tough they say that it's the same amount because it's measured by ounces, but I really don't buy that. Prices are ok for what they give, but it could be better, like before. I guess all this economy thing affected the chain that bad too, but to that point? I think people would be able to pay a little bit extra for what it should be. Service is ok, not the best service but just ok.

Anyway, we had a large group of people visiting so we ordered CPK for everyone. My friend and I went to pick up the order ($70+) and when we got home, we realized that one of the main dishes (chicken pasta) was missing. UGH. Also, when we went to pick up the food, the gal told us that she didn't have anymore bread (it's complimentary so whatever). Upon arriving home and realizing the missing pasta, I called CPK. They put the manager on the phone (a young charming guy from Austin) and he changed my experience completely. He took off THREE dishes from our bill (cut our bill in half) and was so nice to us when we came back! UPDATE (June 2015): I came back here today after having a positive experience over the weekend at the Burbank CPK. I was disappointed, yet again. I ordered a chipotle chicken pizza with no chicken (it was recommended to us by the Burbank CPK and was delicious). I placed my order for take out. Upon getting home, I noticed a large piece of chicken on one slice of pizza and then after a careful examination, noticed that there were SMALL pieces of chicken on other slices as well! UGH. So frustrating since I noticed this after arriving home. I had checked the box quickly at CPK but the chicken was not noticeable until I was in bright light.

319,Priya G.,"Glendale, United States",492,247,236.0,3.0,2015-02-01,"CPK is a chain restaurant that has a variety of Italian food - pizzas, pastas, etc. It's never my first choice as the food is only slightly above average. Anyway, we had a large group of people visiting so we ordered CPK for everyone. My friend and I went to pick up the order ($70+) and when we got home, we realized that one of the main dishes (chicken pasta) was missing. UGH. Also, when we went to pick up the food, the gal told us that she didn't have anymore bread (it's complimentary so whatever). Upon arriving home and realizing the missing pasta, I called CPK. They put the manager on the phone (a young charming guy from Austin) and he changed my experience completely. He took off THREE dishes from our bill (cut our bill in half) and was so nice to us when we came back! UPDATE (June 2015): I came back here today after having a positive experience over the weekend at the Burbank CPK. I was disappointed, yet again. I ordered a chipotle chicken pizza with no chicken (it was recommended to us by the Burbank CPK and was delicious). I placed my order for take out. Upon getting home, I noticed a large piece of chicken on one slice of pizza and then after a careful examination, noticed that there were SMALL pieces of chicken on other slices as well! UGH. So frustrating since I noticed this after arriving home. I had checked the box quickly at CPK but the chicken was not noticeable until I was in bright light. I called the CPK and spoke with Ismael who was the manager on duty. He refunded the charge and sent me a gift card in the mail to come back. I will go back with my husband and eat in person there since our issues always seem to be with take-out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20,3.28,3.51,3.488,3.0200000000000005,3.418

I love their ""penthouse"" location and view down onto Brand Blvd. There's a delightful, open feel to this establishment. They're pretty hard to come by these days.  Had lunch here last weekend. The two of us shared a full salad (BBQ chicken ranch for almost $15) and a wild mushroom pizza (about $14). The price of the food has really gone up over the years. I still remember the days of $9.95 pizzas here. My usual beverage is the strawberry iced tea. They were nice to accommodate our request for an iced coffee. They don't have it on the menu but they made one for us anyway.  I'm not crazy about their complimentary baguette. It has a raw taste to it. The herbed dipping oil is delicious though.  More than half the salad and two slices of pizza were left over from our lunch.

Usually I come here to pickup lunches for my department (more on that latter). Sometimes though I come here though for my own lunch. The service is really hit or miss, and usually is miss. On my last time here for lunch our waitress forgot our waters after we asked her twice. On the second time she only brought one back. My ice tea was never refilled (nor was there an offer to refill it). She also spaced on my pizza dough rewards points and brought us the full check after I told her I had the rewards and gave  her my rewards number. Pretty typical experience for me when I go for my own lunch.  The takeout process usually is much better. Usually when I go to pickup an order I deal with Sarah. Sarah is my CPK hero. I go often enough that she knows me by name and already has entered my pizza dough number for me. She is just that awesome.

The two of us shared a full salad (BBQ chicken ranch for almost $15) and a wild mushroom pizza (about $14). The price of the food has really gone up over the years. I still remember the days of $9.95 pizzas here. My usual beverage is the strawberry iced tea. They were nice to accommodate our request for an iced coffee. They don't have it on the menu but they made one for us anyway.  I'm not crazy about their complimentary baguette. It has a raw taste to it. The herbed dipping oil is delicious though.  More than half the salad and two slices of pizza were left over from our lunch. Service was great on a busy Saturday lunch service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60,3.16,3.43,3.536,2.8000000000000003,3.322

I mentioned to my servers I was a former employee and Jed and I had mutual co-workers so we had a little conversation about people we knew.  My experience was pleasant, food was excellent, restaurant is clean. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because throughout our dining experience I noticed the host was telling other guests about some sort of CPK promotion, sign up and get a free small plate, which when I overheard wondered why she didn't mention the promotion to me as I would have loved to sign up. Also a group got seated right next to our table and the chef came out personally and brought them a complimentary chips and guacamole. So everyone was getting some sort of special treatment besides my daughter and I.

It might have been a novel, upcoming establishment back in the 90s, but now it is just far beyond its prime. I admire some of their creativity in making pizzas with less than typical ingredients, but whatever quality that may have existed is just gone. While the Sicilian pizza I had surely wasn't skimpy on ingredients and was a good size for the price, there was barely any sauce or cheese. It was a dry, bland pizza where I felt like I was merely eating bread with meat toppings. I could've stuck to the bread and olive oil if I wanted a carb heavy dinner. It's not just specific to the Glendale location, but a couple other locations had subpar pizza as well, so it seems like the CPK brand has suffered in general. They still have some decent salads and a couple other items, but the pizza is a fraction of what it used to be. CPK, it's time to call it a day.

For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered Chicken Tequila Fettuccini. He orders it every time and loves it! I ordered the Hand Tossed Margarita Pizza. It was okay. Just okay.

31,John L.,"Long Beach, CA",199,124,384.0,5.0,2016-02-06,First off the bartender I think his name is Joe was garbage. He was too slow to even take our orders. Even when he returned my change he basically tossed it back on the counter to me. In a lot of cultures I think that's considered disrespectful and rude. But the reason why I gave 5 stars was because of the manager with the hair combed back and earrings. He was extremely helpful and polite at all times.

332,Ara D.,"Glendale, United States",6,56,,1.0,2016-03-01,"Frankly, I'm surprised that CPK is still around. It might have been a novel, upcoming establishment back in the 90s, but now it is just far beyond its prime. I admire some of their creativity in making pizzas with less than typical ingredients, but whatever quality that may have existed is just gone. While the Sicilian pizza I had surely wasn't skimpy on ingredients and was a good size for the price, there was barely any sauce or cheese. It was a dry, bland pizza where I felt like I was merely eating bread with meat toppings. I could've stuck to the bread and olive oil if I wanted a carb heavy dinner. It's not just specific to the Glendale location, but a couple other locations had subpar pizza as well, so it seems like the CPK brand has suffered in general. They still have some decent salads and a couple other items, but the pizza is a fraction of what it used to be. CPK, it's time to call it a day. You had a good run, but there are a lot of new players in the game that do it much better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=80,3.08,3.27,3.48,2.468,3.194

He was hard and fast working jumping around everywhere to make sure everything was going perfect. He was working under a lot of pressure and it didn't phase him.

My go to meal here is the quinoa and arugula salad with salmon. The half order is plenty a serving and I usually only eat half of it and pack the rest.  Their lettuce wraps are fresh and so tasty too and the market soup I think it's called is great.  The service is very attentive and the servers hustle. When it's busy there is a bit of a wait for a table but once seated and ordered, the staff and even the manager wait on you hand and foot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale,3.24,3.12,3.292,3.0280000000000005,3.1680000000000006

WaaaaI could have paid extra for a stick of celery.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale,3.64,3.34,3.312,,3.4600000000000004

272,Cara H.,"Glendale, United States",537,780,464.0,3.0,2017-12-01,"I really like CPK, but on my first visit to this location, I found it very dry. The BBQ chicken on the pizza and the chicken in the Chinese Chicken Salad were dry.  It kinda tasted like premade chicken breast strips.  The pizza was good, but tastes exactly like the CPK frozen pizzas they sell at target for $5.  The Chinese Chicken salad was good besides the dry chicken.   I would come back again cause I've always liked CPK, I'm hoping it was just this one time. I also wanna try the butter cake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale,3.88,3.32,3.304,,3.544
