83,Nicole O.,"Irving, TX",73,3,2.0,3.0,2012-04-29,"Now, I've always been a fan of the CPK frozen pizzas so I had to try this place. I went there yesterday after work and if you register with them on their website you can print off a $5.00 off your order of $20.00 or more, so that enhanced the ""should I try it or not."" Now we got there and order the dynamite shrimp..which if I remember correctly Applebees has something very similiar and in all honesty they taste exactly the same. Not bad, just un-original. So there pizza selection was amazing. Finally decided on the Club Pizza. Now I will hand it to them on this one. Never seen or tasted anything like it before. It had bacon and cheese, then on top of that was alot of lettuce rolled in a mayonaise sauce they make. Atop of that was huge slices of avacado. The pizza pretty much won me over. The size is not very big, but who wants to take that pizza home with lettuce and avacado and reheat it? So I saw there point on that one. Beer prices are too high for me there, so just had water.  The waiter was exemplerary, I would say yes I would return or maybe order the pizza to-go next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.8920000000000003,3.6000000000000005

California Pizza Kitchen really led the way with Gourmet pizza many years ago. They have tried to refresh their menu but it just doesn't cut it like it used to. I tried to mix it up with the new Habenero Carnitas pizza. It was good but Grimaldi's, across the street just blows this place away with a traditional, no gimmick pie. Also had the Asian Chicken Salad. Tasted like it was poured out of a pre-made pouch. Just was not like I remember it. Everything tasted good and service was friendly and efficient. Just lost my taste for this place.

They just seemed to become just blah as time went on. The pizzas are good with a wide variety. They have many salad choices and I like that they offer the ""Two in a Bowl"" soup. The two soups, tortilla and pea complement each other well. They also have an array of pastas, chicken dishes and sandwiches. A little bit of everything. I noticed they recently put a few new things on their menu that look very interesting. I like that they are staying with the new ""get healthy trend"" and put quinoa in one of their salads. I'm not sure I've seen quinoa in a mainstream restaurant to date. I tried their Asparagus and Arugula salad which was outstanding!

The manager himself came over and took my order and got it right. While I was waiting for the pizza two other servers came by and asked if I needed or wanted anything.

The food was good just on the high end. The husband is a picky pizza eater and never liked it, Plus it was always awkward to get in and out, add construction which made it worse. We got a free kids meal from a reading club so decided to give it an updated shot after a movie one wed afternoon just the kiddo and I.  The service was good, and we stuck to pizza because it was in the name. Yet I will admit I for what would be a ""plain one topping pizza"" it's on the pricy end. My daughter got a plain cheese and I did the smaller tomato and cheese. We ended up still spending about if not more after adding tip what we would have taking her somewhere a little more kid friendly.

The food is still good but they have fallen stagnant and service has deteriorated.  It has been a while since we'd visited this location and the old pizza standbys are there and I was glad to see some options with the calorie count next to it. I ordered the shrimp zucchini fettuccine - it was good but the shrimp could have used some more seasoning. The sauce is a broth but I enjoyed the way the zucchini is incorporated into the dish.  The most surprising thing right off the bat is how empty the place is. I remember when there was a long wait for a table. The service was nothing spectacular and I didn't see anything that needed improvement cleanliness-wise.  I did notice that our server was not even in uniform. He was wearing jeans and a polo short. Wasn't there a time when they wore uniforms?

25,Brad N.,"Frisco, TX",486,1057,234.0,3.0,2014-06-23,"A co-worker picked CPK for his birthday lunch last week, and upon walking in, I realized that it has probably been (literally) 20 years since I've been in the place. For better or worse, the interior, though clean, looks like it may not have changed much in that 20 years. I was almost getting a coffee shop/diner vibe from it (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Upon being seated, our server brought out some small bread pieces with a tiny dish of herb infused oil; it was good, but the oil dish needs to be about twice as big as it was.  Browsing the menu, I almost went with my standby from the '90s, Thai chicken pizza,. but I decided to go with the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. Upon delivery, I was a bit surprised to find that it was cut into five (!) unequally sized pieces (I didn't try to do the math). It featured chicken, bacon, red and yellow bell pepper, green onion and possibly some other veggies. The sauce, although vaguely ""jerk-y"", almost seemed more like a sweet and sour. It was an OK taste, but I've had decently authentic jerk chicken, and this wasn't it. Most of the heat seemed to come from my self-applied crushed red pepper flake.  The crust was a tiny bit tough (and much more so when I ate the rest for dinner), bit was otherwise OK.  All in all, it was a decent meal, and the menu has enough variety to where everyone can find something to eat, but it wouldn't be my first choice for the best and/or most authentic pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7640000000000002,3.2000000000000006

Mid afternoon.  Very light customer traffic.  Were greeted by the smiling and friendly seating host who quickly put us in our favorite booth.   Then nothing. Seriously - nothing.  At least three waiters walked past us a couple of times, not even acknowledging our existence.  Then the manager walked by us.  Twice.  We had suddenly become invisible.  Lots of visiting other tables by the waiters and the manager; lots of laughter at those tables.  Crickets at ours. I tried to get the attention of the waiters a couple of times.  No.  After nearly 15 minutes, I finally walked back to the seating host, who acted surprised that I was visible.  He seemed genuinely shocked at my presence - didn't remember us at all.   So the seating host walked up to one of the wait staff, who then began to argue with him about serving us.  What the hell?  So far as we could tell, we didn't stink and we could see each other, so why did all this happen? After much arguing, she came to our table and I tried to ask her about a discount coupon we had.  She took our drink order and said she'd take care of the discount.   Then more nothing.  No drinks, no bread, no nothing.   Just as I reached for my phone to leave, another waiter showed up.  He had just arrived and seemed to be able to see us.  At last!  We weren't invisible any more! He took care of everything in a friendly, but cautious manner.  Apparently he'd been told we were trolls and he had drawn the short straw to be our server.  But, honestly, he did his best.  There was one strange interaction when he asked us if we wanted fresh bread.  We said yes (of course).  Then no bread.  When we asked him about it, he said that the kitchen had decided not to bake any bread.   Finally, the manager came to our table to open our discount card.  But, despite appearing to be the same manager who was friendly and laughing with other customers, he was stone-faced and very unfriendly with us.   Strangest encounter with a restaurant in my life.  I've had worse encounters, but this one took the cake for weirdness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7280000000000006,3.2400000000000007

I arrived later than the rest of the group because of meeting that had already been scheduled, so when I arrived with one additional person in the party they got us caught up with the rest of the group right away.  Alberto brought the two of us a fresh plate of bread and olive oil and go our order in right away. I had the Thai chicken pizza which was very tasty.  The thin crust is very light and has a great crunch or snap to it.  The flavors are full and spicy which makes this relatively simple pizza a real winner.

Both were very good. These are the things that earned the 3 stars awarded. Now for the problems that cost them the other two stars: when I ordered the mojito, my husband ordered a beer. They brought me 2 mojitos and him no beer. After returning one of mojitos his beer arrived. While waiting for our pizza, the waitress asked if I'd like another mojito and I said, ""yes."" That mojito never arrived. When the pizzas arrived, my husband's was not thin and crispy, but he didn't complain. Shortly thereafter, a gentleman from the kitchen showed up to offer the thin and crispy pizza, which had apparently been sitting there all along. He switched pizzas.

I had the california club which is basically a an arula avacado tomatoes salad on top of a chicken pizza.  I prefer hand toss over thin crust.  The pizza itself is bland and they did not have siracha or hot sauce.  We shared a red velvet cake which is really good.  It has a thin layer of vanilla bean. Surprisingly it was not overly sweet or that rich.  I may just stick with the Original bbq chicken pizza since that is what they are known for... Or red velvet cheesecake..

Sure authentic Italian pizza is available in the area but at California Pizza Kitchen you get a yummy pizza with a crispy crust for less than$11.  Order the California Club Pizza; you will not be sorry. At first I thought lettuce on top with avocado and the mix of bacon and chicken is a nice flavor mix. If you are planning on taking some of the pizza home them ask them to put the lettuce be avocados on the side. They will give you extra to take home with you.  The ambiance is nice and clean and has a zen like feel; so California. If you have not visited California Pizza Kitchen in awhile then give them another try.

7,Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",602,677,1990.0,3.0,2015-11-24,"California Pizza Kitchen can either be really good, or very mediocre so read as 3.5 stars since it's not always consistent. I can't remember the last time I went to one, but I know it was at least 2 years ago. We were running errands in the area when our stomachs both growled yesterday, so we caved and figured why not?  It appears as though they may be trying to revamp the menu a bit. They were advertising new mojitos sweetened with agave and fresh mint that sounded yummy. They still have a lengthy list of wines as well which always pair nicely with Italian fare.  My husband ordered a beer and we started with their white bean hummus. It's served with your choice of traditional or whole wheat pita bread which they brought us piping hot out of the pizza oven. It was delicious! The only thing I didn't care for were the chunks of tomatos on top. Roasted red peppers I would understand but the combo of hummus and tomatoes didn't make sense to me.  They bring out complimentary bread and oil to the table also with herbs mixed in like rosemary, parsley, and red chili flakes for a subtle kick of heat. The bread was a tad crunchy for me because of recent dental work, but I hollowed out a slice and took the soft center to dunk which I enjoyed.  You have to get pizza at a pizza kitchen yes? So we shared the pepperoni because my husband wanted something with meat. My favorite is their white pie personally, but pepperoni is a classic so I couldn't argue. They have a roasted chicken and garlic pizza right now as well, but I'm weird about chicken and would lose my appetite if even the slightest piece of gristle made it to my plate so we didn't risk it. (this is why I stopped eating chicken at chipotle years ago too).  The pizza was good this time, albeit very oily from the pepperoni. Bonus points to our server though who refilled our waters at lightening speed and brought us things like extra napkins without having to ask.  While it's not the greatest pizza in the world, it will do in a pinch. I'm sure we will be back again, even if it is in another two years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.604,3.0800000000000005

Despite our disappointment with them, we decided to give them another shot because we were feeling nostalgic. We decided to order two pizzas from there hoping that with their renovations came revitalized dishes.  We ordered the california veggie pizza and the thai chicken pizza online and were given an estimated ready time. I arrived a few minutes early and parked in the designated pick-up parking spot as instructed. I'm pretty patient so I waited until 10 minutes after the estimated ready time before getting anxious. I texted my mom and asked her if I was supposed to go inside. She assured me that I was just supposed to wait in the parking spot. I waited another five minutes and then another car pulled up next to me. I decided I would watch them and see if they went inside. They didn't; so the wait continued. Finally after another 10 minutes, a worker came outside, but he only went to the other man's car. He didn't even stop by my car. This really made me angry. Then after disappearing for another five minutes, he came out with the other guy's pizza and a receipt for me to sign. He went inside right after and I continued to wait another 5 minutes for him to reappear. This time he thankfully had my pizza, which I presumed would be fresh out of the oven since they made me wait 35 minutes. When I got home (I live 2 minutes away) we were disappointed to find that the pizza was not even warm. We had to heat up our pizza in the toaster oven. As for the flavors, they were sub par. The thai chicken had a bit of a kick, but there was barely any chicken on it. The veggie pizza was decent, but once again nothing special.

The food was awesome, the drinks were marvelous, and we will definitely be returning! The manager was also incredibly accommodating! We are glad we chose to eat here tonight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine,2.96,3.23,3.23,,3.122

There seemed to be plenty of employees in the building, probably about the same number as there were customers. It took another 30 min to get our bill! Crazy! Then there's the food. It was not very good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine,2.8,3.19,3.19,,3.034
1,Madiha K.,"Dallas, TX",60,48,3.0,3.0,2017-12-24,"We ordered the Margherita, California Veggie and Five Cheese, with the latter two being the only ones I would recommend. The pizzas themselves were pretty good, they only come in one size that is enough for about 3 people. I also got the Mango Strawberry cooler which was refreshing and pretty to look at. This place is good for larger parties so that's why we picked it as our pizza destination...but with that being said the service sucks. I don't understand establishments that pride themselves on being good for big groups but then hire wait staff that resent any party above 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine,2.88,3.21,3.21,,3.078
