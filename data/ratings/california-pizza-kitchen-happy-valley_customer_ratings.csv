75,I K.,"Beaverton, OR",3,57,48.0,3.0,2012-01-22,"Was in for lunch. Had a pasta dish, it tasted like it was from a box, it was a pesto pasta pene dish, it was gross. It was undercooked and oddly was missing oils so it was very dry. The pizza was decent, but was very expensive. The exotic teas are really just bar drinks with sugary syrup. They tasted good, but were very artificial despite asking my server for a low sugar tea, don't like any sugar at all, i ended up with a horribly sweet beverage. I think this is more a of a reflection on the franchise food then the quality of this particular restaurant. I did not seem to have anything that was above what you could find in a box in the grocery store or frozen food aisle in a standard grocery store. The allure of this restaurant is lost on me from this visit.  The service at this location was attentive and the visual appeal of this restaurant was pleasant. Salads were oddly over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=60,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001
33,Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, WA",105,499,248.0,4.0,2012-02-24,I love CPK's Small Cravings menu. It's perfect for people like me who wants to try a little bit of everything. My favorite is the Korean Beef Taco and Asparagus Arugula Salad. I prefer the taco with a wedge of lemon instead of lime though. My one-year-old loves the asparagus in that salad.  Their staff were helpful and friendly and their restrooms were clean and non-smelly; it also has a changing table.

But there I was, sitting in my car reviewing Yelp after a 3 hours shopping trip to Macys, when I spotted CPK right across the parking lot. ""How bad could it be"" and ""It's better than waiting"" are certainly the two thoughts that caused me to pick up pizza here.  The service was incredible. On my way out with my to-go order I was offered an umbrella that I was free to return on my next visit. While I didn't take one, I appreciated the offer.  The pizza was definitely a ""meh"". I had the five cheese and tomato and while it filled my empty gut it didn very little for my taste buds. The crust was sweet and the rest of the stuff was bland. I got hubby some pepperoni and sausage thing; he liked it but  what does he know? :p There are much better options in Portland but I suppose if you're at the mall and really want pizza, it's better than Sbarro's, right?

37,Melissa W.,"Vancouver, WA",31,60,3.0,2.0,2013-05-29,"I was here this weekend with my husband's family.  It was ok, but not excellent.  We had an extremely long wait for a table, but we had a sort of large group (10) so that can be expected. Finally we were seated and ordering drinks and a late lunch.  The plus?  The half salads are huge!  The negative to that?  I ordered the Classic Caesar Salad with chicken.  It had no flavor.  In fact, I think they forgot the dressing altogether.  It also had no lemon wedges.  I don't think I've ever ordered Caesar and not gotten lemon.  I'm not kidding about the dressing being non-existent.  I typically think salads have too much dressing.  There was no dressing and no flavor whatsoever but after such a long wait for the table and a pretty long wait for our food, I wasn't sending it back- I was so hungry.  There was quite a bit of shaved Parmesan cheese on it and about 2 croutons.  Over all it was super disappointing. I also had a half slice of my husbands ""Meat Lover"" pizza.  It was seriously lacking flavor as well.  Except for a very strange sweet honey flavor- not a good kind of understated sweet honey flavor to contrast the salty meats, but kind of an overwhelming sickeningly sweet honey flavor and the meats weren't salty really or flavorful at all, just bland. Overall this dining experience was pretty disappointing.  They did do well at refilling our ice teas and lemonades.  The kids enjoyed their meals for the most part.  I'd start listing other restaurants that I like around there, but that would be rude.  It will suffice to say I'll be dining elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=20,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

Never did she come back to see how things were or if we need refills on our drinks. We ordered a Canadian bacon pizza to share. I myself am not picky about pizza. I'll eat most pizza's as long as it has toppings I like. This pizza tasted like a frozen tostino's pizza. I actually dont mind those kinds of pizza's, so I did eat it.

The dough is nice and light which accommodates the distinctive flavors.  I personally like the bbq chicken.  I also like the mushroom truffle oil.  Also good is the lettuce wraps and salads.  Again full of flavor!  The portions are also really good!  The sangria red and white are super tasty on a hot day!  IF it's cold I usually get a beer.  Save room for the dessert because the butter cake taste like buttah.  No really, it melts in your mouth and you certainly feel guilty for eating a cake called butter cake, but what do you expect when the words, Can I have the butter cake comes out of your mouth as the waitress takes down your order.  You might as well get it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  So recap:  This chain restaurant does not have unique pizza or flavors, but the overall experience leaves me coming back every once in a while from the service to the appetizers, to salad and pizza, to drinks and desserts.  It's a whole package deal at this chain restaurant!

You sit there looking over the menu contemplating which flavors you want to explore. Oh, man there are so many! I couldn't decide! Salmon, Pasta, Pizza, or even their fish tacos! It was definitely a difficult decision to make. I went ahead and got the Pesto Creme Penne. I also ordered a peach lemonade because I'm am pretty peachy. As I was waiting for my food, I looked around and saw how clean the restaurant was and how the people working here had the best attitude you could ask for.

Needless to say, I did not stay and wait. I highly recommend other pizza places near by. You will get served much quicker, and with better service.
