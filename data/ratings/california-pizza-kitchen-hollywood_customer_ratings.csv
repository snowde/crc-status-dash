I sat there for about 5 mins or so without being helped. I didn't want to be ""that table"" who complained. I also know that Im not the only person on the face of the planet so of course I had to wait. The server did show up and we ordered. I got the Chinese Chicken salad. I order a full and thought it would be bigger, however it was enough for two dinners. And it was so yummy, my little me got the cheese pizza from the kids menu and we both loved it. Some of the best pizza ever. I tipped the waitress 20 percent and although I didn't see much of her, she was ok.  My only complaint was they only give you bread if you ask for it.

I, reluctantly, ordered the Tomato Basil Spaghettini ($10.00) instead, which is spaghetti, tomatoes, garlic and basil.

I've been here a few times with friends or coworkers even though I'd prefer dining at some other places located in the Hollywood/Highland center. I normally opt for their spring rolls, the tortilla soup, a salad, and perhaps a pizza. This location is tucked in the back. They have a great patio and plenty of seating inside. You'll find it near the Starbucks. Customer service is friendly and you'll find plenty to look at while dining.

140,Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2280,807,1539.0,1.0,2012-05-18,"Sometimes it is great to have family in town. You get to hang out with people that you haven't seen in a very long time, you get to show off the fabulous town you live in, and you get to have a reason to pig out. But unfortunately one of the downsides with tourists is sometimes they want to go places that you know suck - but you have to humor them. That was our experience here yesterday. Thankfully, my boyfriends aunt gave us gift cards so we had $30 to spend which wasn't ours. Our bill came to $7 after taking the gift cards into account and I guess that that isn't too bad.  Service was the same kind of service that you would expect when everyone assumes you are a tourist. Too bad I work in this mall, and my boyfriend lives a block away. We are rather snobbish in the whole ""we're not tourists and therefore demand service"" aspect of things. We were seated immediately but then it took a good ten minutes to even see the patio server. He was okay, not the best. He only really stopped at the table when delivering food and drinks. When he was taking our food order (we wanted a pizza done half and half) it seemed to confuse him. He forgot our bread. We all left the table under the general impression that he was stoned.  Everyone else split the pizza which was about $11. I had the Kung Pao spaghetti which was about $10, but then to add chicken was an extra $3. I always remember it being super delicious with chicken but when it came to the table it had about 3 chunks of chicken in it (it used to be strips) and was definitely not worth the ""upgrade"". It was also incredibly spicy. I mean - I understand this is a spicy dish but I feel this one was overly spiced. The portion was a good size - I had enough to share at the table and take home for late night drunken leftovers.  Overall - thank the pizza gods we had a gift card! I would have been pissed if I had to throw down any more than $5 for this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=140,3.4,3.27,3.27,2.6920000000000006,3.322

It seems California Pizza Kitchen has become a staple every time my sister, my good friend and I celebrate the end of a busy work week. This CPK is actually very convenient as it is in the Hollywood & Highland area - the place where all the action happens! Located in the The H&H structure, parking & getting around is not at all a problem. For starters try the Spinach Artichoke dip---definitely a must! If you are craving for the nice warm bread to start, you have to ask for it as it is not something that they automatically bring to your table anymore ( great idea to avoid unnecessary waste! ) Let's get on to the food! I had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine- great choice! The pasta was cooked to perfection, the chicken pieces - hefty & well seasoned, the sauce was creamy, buttery, with a hint of citrus - the meal was delicious!   My sister had the Kung Pao Spaghetti which she had me try - OMG! it was so good! It was the perfect twist to something we commonly think as an Italian dish! The Kung Pao spaghetti is gluten free! and for peeps allergic to peanuts, you could request it to be ""off"" the dish. The four cheese ravioli which my good friend had was scrumptious! (of course my fork dove in that plate too ha ha!) Little square temptations under the blanket of molten cheese and sauteed mushrooms, drizzled with fresh green basil ribbonettes, it smells fresh & rich!  Lastly, I just want to give credit to their nice waiters/servers! Having & enjoying good food is something, but to have a great server makes the whole experience delightful.

I have found in Los Angeles that there are almost TOO MANY choices when it comes to just about everything, and some days I am just so exhausted at the thought of having to decide where to eat that I skip meals all together - enter California Pizza Kitchen. CPK is my go-to when I just don't know where to go to. With such a large menu, there is always something I want to eat. My absolute favorites are their chopped salad, white pizza, and mac-n-cheese. The thing about their mac-n-cheese is that you can order the kids' size and it is still HUGE and will only run you like $6! I always add grilled chicken pieces, so it ups the price to about $9, but still you can't beat a whole meal for less than $10 that is NOT fast food. The Hollywood/Highland location is obviously in a busy location, but I have never experienced a wait. I have done take-out on multiple occasions, as well as eaten at the bar and every time I am there the servers are attentive, the food is delicious, and everything is done in a timely manner.

Been to almost every location from Manhattan Beach (corporate account regular) and all OC, LA/Valley areas. Dine in and curbside pick up. Practically memorize the menu.  We were debating on driving to Umami Burger or CPK (after seeing a show at El capitan) We chose cpk since it was family friendly. The hostess with short dark hair said it'll be 25min wait, so we decided to stay. After 30min, she told us it'll be another 10-15.hmmm...since we already waited, we decided to stay. Then after 1hour, she said ""you're next right after this other group"".  waiting... still not being seated and noticing tons of people being called.  So I politely asked the hostess again, what's going on, we've waited well over an hour and she said ""the time I gave you was just an estimate"". Then I said, that I noticed several people that came after us, being called up and she said (with a slight attitude) that they are being called because they had a smaller table.  (tables of 4, 5, 6 adults i don't think is fair to be seated first!) We were 4 adults, 2 babies (both 2 yr -not in highchairs) and an infant 6months.   I do think she forgot about us, because she had too look at the OTHER paper, for our names. Or perhaps, she wasn't paying attention to who was arrived early or not. I saw tables, that could've fit our party. I was pissed and wanted to leave, but everyone was just hungry and didn't feel like driving/waiting again elsewhere.  Finally they sat us after 1hour and 35min. (in the meantime a party of 3 who arrived AFTER us, already ate and was leaving) My friend told the other male hostess about our wait, and he got the manager, who was very apologetic and comped 2 small appetizers which came out quickly.  However, with babies, time is more valuable. If the hostess told us 45min wait in advance, we would've gone elsewhere.  They labeled us as a table of 7 AND included the automatic gratuity for a large party. (the infant doesn't even eat solids) and the toddlers just ate 1 pizza crust each and boxed the rest. Ironically, after all the wait, we weren't even seated at 1 table! Our hubbies sat in a separate booth across our booth. And the ""stroller"" which she added as the 7th person, had to be left in the front. (she also did not mention we couldn't take the stroller to the table even though i told her we had a stroller) We tried to make the best of the night.

216,Tim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,261,7.0,2.0,2013-05-29,"Weak. Eaten here only a few times over the years. Salads were the same every time - chopped, tossed with too much dressing, tastes like something I imagine you'd get at a Crapplebee's or IwishitwasSaturday's. Same with pizzas - topping and cheese are okay but the dough is half baked: not brown, not golden, just beige and soft (not to be confused with dough-y.) Nine at night, your oven should be hot by now, right? That's just how they think pizza is supposed to be, I guess. Oven needs to be hotter on top and bottom. The dough reminded me of the  only time I ever had Little Caesar's pizza. I was at Kmart, famished, grabbed a slice out of desperation. It was junk pizza. Not saying CPK is junk pizza, but the dough (calling it ""crust"" is a misnomer here) is like that: bleh.  Service is good. Patio chairs are a laugh: miniature, wicker, bucket seats, sized for a child. Actually, they had to have been designed to hold a doll or a lawn elf or some other inanimate object. I'm 5'9"", average weight - this chair was like sitting on a tiny, twisted, wicker-wrapped jungle gym embedded with warped, cement skeeballs. I sat down, stood right back up and requested a new chair. I puzzled as I looked around and saw other patrons contentedly squashed into these atrocities: they must've been either too afraid to speak up, in a state of shock, pain, or denial, or, most likely, they were experiencing cognitive dissonance, reasoning that it is impossible that a restaurant would furnish itself with this torturous seating device and highly improbable that such an uncomfortable chair would be designed and manufactured to begin with. Therefore - they convinced themselves - they were enjoying a perfectly reasonable, average or better, level of seating comfort. If anything, I recommend going there and sitting in a patio chair. You will never experience anything like it anywhere else. p.s. I don't like it when people from the business respond to my review with some lame appeal, but of all the 1 and 2 star reviews (there are LOTS AND LOTS) - why respond to just *one*?

Back to the review of CPK Hollywood ... Been here many times and it's always crowded but the wait moves along pretty quickly.  The place is clean and looks cool.  The staff are attentive and always seem to get the orders right.  I like this place, because it's a just a little teeny bit off the main drag where all the crazies are but close enough you can get your whacko fix within a minute assuming you don't stop by Papa's right down the stairway (which is a must). I'm a little angry that they got rid of the BLT Pizza!  I loved that one because the lettuce was finely chopped and the pizza tasted just like a BLT sandwich.  Yum.  Instead they killed that entree and substituted a ""California Club"" the waiter says.  It's just like the BLT but it also includes chicken.  Okay, what the heck?  So, out comes the pizza and it's basically a full on mixed greens salad placed right on top of the pizza.  With the BLT at least you could pick it up and eat it without having that much fall off.  These are huge pieces of lettuce that you need to cut with a knife before you can insert it in your mouth!  So, I pick up a slice as carefully as possible and at least 80% of the salad falls to the plate just as I get it in my mouth.  So, I end up having a few more slices, then grab my fork and eat my ... side salad.  Maybe it's executed nicely in the kitchen, but I doubt the chef has actually eaten this mess.  Now it was tasty, but not what I expected.

I can have an awesome experience one day, then an absolutely awful one on my very next visit. It's not just the service, but the food quality and it's something I don't understand, seeing as CPK is a chain, and consistency is something that should be standard, no matter what the location is.  I understand service can be hit or miss because sometimes people are just off. However, in this case, it must have been staff shortage because for some reason, our server had a very large station and several large parties. That left me and my friends constantly looking around for her, or for anyone for that matter - for service.  I don't know if the food quality is on me - or the chefs, as I didn't like my dish at all. I decided to try the Kung Pao Spaghetti and not only was it bland, there was no reason for the words 'Kung Pao' in the name because it wasn't spicy at all either. I'm sure it didn't help that I had just gotten back from China and was hoping for something more authentic and flavorful as the foods I enjoyed while there.  Anyway, my friends were equally unhappy with the experience but if history plays out - the next time I dine at a CPK, everything should be ok, at the least if not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=60,3.24,3.38,3.38,2.7280000000000006,3.3240000000000007

48,Ben R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,6,11.0,1.0,2016-07-25,"As a former server I usually do not like throwing people under the bus, but this time I really need to make an exception. I have been to this location dozens of times and I've never been provided with such sub-par service. My friends and I all had crazy, long days of work, and the place was decently busy but we all had a hankering for our CPK favorites. We got seated, and as soon as Trenton walked up to us (after 15 minutes and only after my fiancé went over and complained to someone) we immediately knew we were in trouble. He was spaced out, sluggish, hard to communicate with, and we had to repeat our orders multiple times because every time he'd read them back it's all be wrong. He made us all extremely uncomfortable with the way he presented himself, and we all braced ourselves for what we knew would be a terrible meal. We didn't get drinks (or the water we requested) for ten plus minutes, and three other tables with people who'd arrived after us were getting their food. I approached Trenton about this and asked him if we could expect our food soon, as we had been waiting over thirty minutes and we hadn't seen him at all. He gave me a patronizing look, as if it were amusing, and made up a bunch of excuses I knew to be untrue. Over then next fifteen minutes he brought each of our dishes one at a time, and once it was all set down we didn't see him again for twenty more minutes. The whole time he moved slow as molasses and seemed to be extremely spaced out. My fiancé and I had not expected to be there so long, and we both had to be up for work at the crack of dawn and had to leave early. Those of you that have been to CPK know that the average turnaround time is no more than 40 minutes. We were there for nearly two hours. Like I said at the beginning, I was a server and used to get peeved when I got these kind of complaints, but I worked at a fine dining restaurant, and Trenton would've gotten the boot in less than a week.

The review could easily end there, but if you're picky, read: I understand when people find me difficult to please. And while all of their staff does a good job, I'm particularly grateful for the hostess, Mary, who always deals with all the little requests and nuances of my order and does it with a sincere smile. To the management, and from one employer to another -- if you fail to acknowledge talent you're likely to lose it. My recommendation would be to make her a server. Your customers deserve her level of service -- and she in turn, deserves a position which is paid for their level of performance, not just attendance.

162,Carolyn P.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,3,1.0,1.0,2017-08-03,"Came in here yesterday with my family and my service dog. The Hispanic hostess in the front demanded to see an ID for my dog. My dog had a service vest on that we purchased, although everyone knows there's really no proper identification or vest required. We told her we didn't have one because we aren't required to show that by law. I understand that maybe because she's unfamiliar with how the system works, she could refuse to seat us inside. What bothered me the most was the fact that she and her coworkers were pointing fingers and snickering at us. If you don't know proper law, educate yourself. Even if we were in the wrong, we are still customers and don't deserve to be treated like that",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=60,3.24,3.45,3.36,,3.366

Our server was amazing - despite being really busy he made sure to always check in on us and gave us plenty of attention. There was a small mishap with one of our dishes but the server and manager were very polite about it and quick to fix the problem. I was very pleasantly surprised by the great customer service that we received.

I'm giving this place a three star only because the host Vanessa in my opinion is not the right person to be hosting this establishment. Poorly trained and inpatient. The Rolling of her eyes very unprofessional. We sat outside with our family and saw her do that to multiple people. Might want to look into that California Pizza Kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=20,3.32,3.48,3.38,,3.4160000000000004
11,Kasey D.,"Winter Garden, FL",72,95,472.0,2.0,2017-09-04,"Let me start off by saying... I have been to CPKs before and I have had a much better experience than what we had last night.  It was slow for a Sunday night and basically everything else around was already closed. We got out of seeing A Goofy Movie at El Cap and wanted some dinner. We walked across the street and found CPK. The hostess stand out front was empty but had a sign telling us to ""See Hostess for Seating"". In my mind that is telling me to go inside the restaurant and find the hostess or anyone to find a table. The three of us walk in and IMMEDIATELY the hostess comes around the corner to accost us. She tells us that we were supposed to be waiting outside and the sign told us so. I told her no the sign told us to see the hostess so I came to find you. She was very rude and just pointed to a table and gave us some menus and had us sit there. She didn't even walk us to the table. I wish I had gotten her name because I wanted to make sure someone knew about it with every last detail but after that she was no where to be seen for the rest of the night.  Our waitress was friendly and took our drink order right away and when we ordered food the food came out quick. The place was very slow compared to all the hustle and bustle outside on the street at Hollywood blvd. The food was okay just as it always is. I think at the later hour that it was we just wanted something to eat rather than fight the crowds down on the sidewalks to find something better to eat. It was also weird to me that we were eating at 9:30 at night and a lot of restaurants closed at 10pm even in one of the busiest parts of LA. I will have to say though that experience makes to not have great feelings about returning to a CPK, rude staff, bland pizza, and a menu that I haven't seen changes in a long time. Also there was no bread given. The last CPK I went to in Honolulu gave us bread before our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood,3.2,3.45,3.372,,3.35

14,Sir S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,5.0,5.0,2017-10-14,"Okay, so it's literally across the street from my residence. I've been going off and on for years & I've had 30-40% of the menu selections; I can't remember any complaints in the past as far as quality, freshness, temperature, or presentation of the dish.  Their oven for pizza baking is interestingly interesting, so say the least. Prices are fairly reasonable; managers are active on the floor & from time to time will introduce themselves to the seated guests when duty hasn't solicited them elsewhere.  The only thing that really set me off with the pay system at this establishment is at the bottom of the receipt it breaks down the tipping amount based on one's individual tab in increments of 15, 18, & 20%. Again, that's based on the cost of the tab & is quite helpful as far as illuminating one having to calculate.  The problem is they base tip recommendations on the entire tab (including the tax) and that's not supposed to be.  EXAMPLE: if my meal total is $5 & with tax it's $5.45  the tip recommendation chart of 15, 18, or 20%, is supposed to be on the $5, not the $5.45. Where is it written that we're supposed to tip tax?  Please tell me because I do stand to be corrected if I'm wrong. But the tax wasn't served to me on a plate nor did the tax give me service, so why should I tip a tab whose total includes the tax? Yes, the $5 is taxable, hence the $5.45, but the $5 alone is what I'm supposed to tip (if I choose), not the $5.45.  I brought it to the attention of my waiter who was working the bar that particular day, but it was kinda' shrugged off as if it was nonexistent. I don't think anyone has ever challenged it or paid any attention to it, but I caught the subliminal trick of mild robbery. gain, I stand to be corrected; each one teach one and I strive to learn something new every day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood,3.2,3.48,3.372,,3.3680000000000008
5,Jennifer S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",334,316,1419.0,1.0,2017-10-19,"300! I've been holding off on my 300th review for something extraordinary.  THIS was simply AMAZING. My family and I were heading over to see Janet in concert (Miss Jackson if ya nasty) at the Hollywood bowl. We left ourselves ample time to eat here and walk over to the bowl, which was about 2 hours and some change. We waited 30 mins for a table. We get in, order, and pay the check immediately so we wouldn't have to wait at the end, and we could just head to the concert fast. We ordered drinks (there were only 3 of us) and waited. Drinks come. We start noticing though that people around us are being sat... and are eating, but our food has yet to make an entrance. This is after like 30 mins of waiting. We ask our waitresses what's going on with our order, and she goes to ""check"". We wait... from my brothers vantage point, he can see her in the kitchen, so of course i turn around to look.  She's arguing with the chef. Someone lost the order ticket. NO FOOD WAS COMING! Omfg!  We asked to see a manager. Now we legit have to sit though a 2 hour concert STARVING. We can't even believe it, but think for sure the manager is going to fix things. Here he comes... with a bill! ""Sorry guys. Sometimes things like this happen."" Then he hands my boyfriend a bill... ""what's THIS?"" ""Oh sorry ya, your drinks weren't added to the bill you pre paid. I refunded it, but not the drinks"". ARE. YOU. FUCKING. SERIOUS? I've never experienced this in all my life. Lol... you would think with such a HUGE fuck up, they'd offer a gift card? Drinks on the house?  Something?  Nah... and YES the waitress knew we were going to the concert. Never eat here.

3,Linda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,169,142.0,3.0,2017-10-27,"A hit or a miss. The food is good but the service can either be good or terrible.  FOOD: The pizzas are generally good and can be shared between 2 people. My favorite is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza.  Their salads are good as well.  MUST TRY: Definitely get the sangria flight! You get three different kinds of sangria with fruit. Sooo good!  It is something I order every time I'm there.  SERVICE: This location is in Hollywood. So there is usually a flow of customers. But even after being seated by the hostess, it was so hard to get the server's attention to even order. During some visits, the servers don't come so I have to ask the hostess to get our server. In the end, the hostess just took our order and served us instead. (Thanks girl, you da VIP) Tips: Parking is usually validated ($2.00 for 2 hours) BUT IF YOU PARK AFTER 10PM, YOU HAVE TO PAY A FLAT RATE OF $15.00! This is even if you came a few minutes before 10pm, apparently (i.e. 9:55pm). So keep this in mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood,3.12,3.43,3.356,,3.306

2,Emily P.,"Derwood, MD",88,16,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Update: I've changed this to one star because I have since had a reaction to that pizza, so it was contaminated with gluten somehow. Luckily I don't have a life-threatening allergy, but for anyone who does, avoid this place. -- Got the gluten-free Margherita pizza to-go. Crust was burnt. Cheese was tasteless. Barely any tomatoes, about 5 small pieces on the entire pizza. Giving this two stars instead of one only because the employees were courteous and accommodating with my allergy and the basil on the pizza was the right amount. I'm not one to leave bad reviews because I'm not very picky but overall the pizza was bad and horribly overpriced ($20!!)

1,Rose B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",16,33,15.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"This rating is based on the service we experienced. Late last month, myself and a party we're waiting for a table during the late afternoon and was told by the hostess that the wait would be about 20 minutes. So we outside with the other parties that were also waiting to be seated. After 15 minutes, we checked to see how far on the list we would be seated with the second hostess. We then noticed some guy go over the fence into the outside patio, waved his friends over to sit at an empty table, and then sat down. Rather than the hostess asking them to leave and wait like the everyone else, he brought their menus and had a waiter come to take their order. Several of us were upset that he allowed this to happen. One of my friends then went inside to see if they were that busy as both hostesses claimed. He said there were eight empty (cleaned and set) tables inside. When he came back out, he told the first hostess (the one that put us on the waitlist) about it and she said we still had to wait. Mind you within 20 minutes we were waiting, only two parties were seated and several more still waiting. This restaurant clearly has poor communication with its staff and needs improvement in order to provide better service for their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood,3.32,3.42,3.36,,3.3800000000000003
