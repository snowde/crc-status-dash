The second time, it was the middle of the afternoon, and the restaurant was half empty. It took 5-10 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge us, then another 10 to ask for our drink order. We just wanted a dessert or two, so we ordered those with our drinks. Both the drinks and desserts arrived about 15 minutes later, and we didn't see our waitress at all until she brought them over. We'd hoped to have our drinks before the desserts came, but apparently she didnt' notice that it's nice to have them before our food. I was glad we only ordered desserts, who knows how long she'd have taken if we got something else.

My boss ALWAYS orders take out from here (about $800/month) and has now slowed that to once a month based on the service alone. Just this week the girl at the take out counter was short with me and a food courier from Room Service in Paradise. She even made me walk all the way back to my car to get the confirmation number for my order. This was a first and mind you that I had spoken with that same girl prior to picking up my order to ask if I needed to bring anything and she told me ""no."" Not to mention it was extremely hot at 12pm and and the escalators by pearl were all out of order. She also told me bread and utensils were in the bag and of course by the time I got back to the office, I realised they weren't. But I wasn't surprised as we are always missing at least one item from our order each time. May be they should focus more on whose their return customers instead of their unreliable tourism cash-cow.

215,Asako O.,"Honolulu, HI",58,212,,5.0,2012-06-26,"California Pizza Kitchen, aka CPK, is a casual restaurant which happens to be one of my favorite places to dine for their fresh salads, pasta and sandwiches.  Even though they specialize in California-style gourmet pizzas, they also offer appetizers, small cravings, soups, salads, pasta, sandwiches, specialty dishes and of course desserts.  CPK makes one of the best BBQ chicken salads ever. It is made with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, black beans, corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, corn, tortilla chips, chopped BBQ chicken and Monterey Jack cheese all tossed in a garden-herb ranch dressing. Their salads are available in full entree as well as half order size. All the ingredients combined make this the most flavorful salad. It is so darn good. Their cranberry walnut chicken and turkey stack sandwiches is also so delicious along with their pastas. What makes the sandwiches taste so good is their homemade focacchia bread which is fresh, light and tasty.   For dessert so far I tried their red velvet cake however it is their butter cake which takes the prize. It is served warm with fresh whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. OMG! The cake is heavenly delicious. For a chain restaurant their menu items are reasonably priced, they give good size portions and service received has been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.3480000000000003,3.5200000000000005
131,Susan W.,"Honolulu, HI",267,213,637.0,3.0,2012-07-16,"I came here with a large group, and we had to wait about 45mins for a table. It wasn't that bad compared to other restaurants in Waikiki with no reservation on a Friday night.  When we finally got our table, I noticed that they moved two tables together in order to fit all 9 of us. One was a circular table that had 5 seats around it and the other was a rectangle for 4. Someone on our table said it looked like a..... yeah.  Anyways, as I was looking at the menu I had planned to get the garlic cream fettuccine, but since it was my friend's friend ""birthday dinner"" he ordered for everyone. We got 2 appetizers which was the spinach artichoke dip and the bbq chicken salad. Both were okay, I didn't eat much because I wanted to eat the main course...THE REAL FOOD lol whatever that was. Apparently we ordered the four cheese ravioli, pesto cream penne pasta, and if I remember correctly like 3 or 4 pizzas. I really liked the four cheese ravioli. I think I had one extra piece compared to everyone lol w/e they didn't want to finish it. The pasta was meh, I don't really like penne and it was a bit dry to my liking. Idk how we all finished all the pizzas because I only had ONE SLICE... and it was nothing special. I rather get my pizza from Pizza Hut.  So I thought the service was going pretty good until we got our bill and everyone was like hella surprised about it. As we passed on the bill to one another, I could tell something was wrong by the looks. When it finally got to me I was like wtf, the total was only $23. How is that possible for 9 of us LOL. Someone suggested we pay it and get outta there asap, but birthday boy said to our waitress that we got the wrong bill.

210,Billy W.,"Honolulu, HI",63,111,12.0,3.0,2012-08-01,"I love CPK! Their creative pizzas bring out the adventure in you and tastes great. Their variety of salads and appetizers certainly rank up there as well. However, the recent downsizing of portions and price increases is pretty ridiculous when you sit down and look at it. The half-sized salads are $10 while full-sized salads are $14-16. Their pizzas are anywhere from $12-16 as are their pastas. I've been to the Ala Moana, Kahala, and Waikiki locations and the prices are all the same. One gimmick that other restaurants should try is their occasional discounts. The manager gives random parties a scratch card. Bring it with you on your next visit, have the manager scratch it, and you might win big $$$! Or a discount on your food bill. Don't scratch it out yourself as that will disqualify it! I think this is a smart yet sneaky technique to get patrons to come back for more... If it weren't for the good food and the gamble (hehe), I probably would've gone elsewhere. Edit: Parking sucks in Waikiki.

Not wow-ing or overwhelming, but consistently good and flavorful. That is why I was disappointed when I've sought you out in the desolate Waikiki and you failed me.  It's Waikiki location is typical of the CPK experience with its standard menu showcasing sandwiches, appetizers, pastas, pizzas, salads, desserts, and of course their small plates. It is a menu that everyone can find something that they will enjoy and simply put a party-pleaser. The ambiance is typical with indoor and outdoor seating. While you may want that ""tropical"" experience of being on an island, the patio can get a bit hot on some days. You'll thank me when the hot sun is bearing down on you and sweating out your drinks! That's pretty much where the differences end. Service is lackluster. I've found it to be hit or miss at the Waikiki location.

A bummer is that when I can't eat the whole Chicken Milanese I have asked the other location if they could do a half order of the chicken and add pasta, and it was never a problem.  At this location, you don't need to ask, I will already tell you, they won't be able to do it.... During midday is the best time to go if you don't wanna wait for a bar seat or table, its not slamming busy yet.  If you absolutely do not want to eat there and want your food ready to pick up, I love that you can go online and order your food and specify when you want to pick it up.

Food at CPK is fairly consistent if you know what you want to get.  I'm a lover of meats on pizza, so I generally get the Meat Lovers or Sicilian.  I got a Sicilian this time around, and was no disappointed.  The food came fairly quickly and promptly, and our waitress was nice and checked on us a few times to see if we were okay.  The spinach artichoke dip was especially cheesy this time around, and is probably one of the better dips for the price out there at these kinds of restaurants.  A+ for that.

He accidentally dropped the tray of waters on our table and broke the glasses. No biggie. I asked if he was alright. Accidents happen. He came by to sweep up the glass. But he didn't come back to wipe down the ice and water off our table after he said he would. After maybe 10 minutes, I had to ask a bus boy to wipe it down. Again, it was not busy during this time. I am not sure why he couldn't come by for less than a minute to clean the table. Moving on, I ordered a half caesar with chicken and my girlfriend ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine. Food came out in good time. My salad was good, but I'm not giving kudos for not screwing up a salad. Unfortunately, as our waiter was pouring black pepper on my salad, he got half on the salad, and the other half on the table and in my water. My girlfriend wasn't fond of her order.

I live in the area and have been a return customer of CPK Waikiki and have dined in and used their online ordering system for pick up countless times but today was probably the most disappointing experience I've had at this branch. Note, this review is not of the food but of the service I just encountered 20 minutes ago. I ordered a salad online and went over to pick it up. I went straight to the take-out counter, like I've done so many times, and was promptly asked what name the order was under. The server was friendly until I handed him the receipt where I was to sign and OPTIONALLY put a tip. Since all he had to do was rip off the receipt and bag my salad, I didn't put a tip...like I've done every time I do an online order. As soon as the server looked the receipt he made a snide and rather loud comment to the other customers seated at the bar, ""I serve 60 customers and I make $4. I love my job."" Obviously, ""I love my job"" was said in a sarcastic tone. It was rude and uncalled for, especially because he was talking to other customers. Then his whole demeanor changed, he started throwing cups into the sink and slamming cabinets. I stood there humiliated and in silence as I felt the other customers stare at me.  One of the worst experiences I ever had in any restaurant...such a shame. I'd rather go to the branch in Ala Moana or Kahala Mall.

I waited upset for 20 mins around other guests and was asked by others what had happened, I had no problem explaining my frustrations. I work in restaurants and customer service so I know that a guest should never be frustrated and upset at the service and if they are it is best to acknowledge them right away before they start spreading the bad news. I had to go back to work so I informed the bartender to cancel my order and that I wanted my money back. He said it would only be a few more mins so I waited and got my food. At that point I asked to speak to a manager the bartender said ""oh, I didn't know you had time, I'll get a manager for you"" I then waited around for a few more mins before deciding to just leave. on the way out I made a complaint to the hosts who informed a manager immediately. He came over and said this was the first he had heard of my situation. He was not very apologetic. Maybe he tried? or maybe he thought I was just trying to get free food, but I was honestly very upset. He did not seem like he cared to know the situation or have patience. He offered to refund my food or to give me a coupon for a free entree, but was not sincere at all & I felt uncomfortable accepting anything from them when they did not seem like they wanted to make it better.

While looking through the menu, I discovered CPK now has a rewards type if program called ""Pizza Dough"" it's an App. Available on the iPhones. Where you earn points for eating at there restaurants. So of course I downloaded and signed up, it's free. Just for signing up, I received a free coca cola and a free small plate. Our server used the free coca cola for our raspberry iced tea and we ordered a mushroom and spinach flat bread pizza ($6.49) which both were free just for signing up. Through the program, for every $100 you spend at their restaurants you receive a $5 gift certificate to use. Which is pretty cool, I don't know much restaurants that have a rewards program. For dessert we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with a scoop of ice cream. That was delicious! I'm not sure how long they'll be having it available, but I would recommend it.

They should serve different ice cream with the butter cake though.  I asked our waiter if Vanilla was the only choice of ice cream and he said yes.  I was disappointed, but it's okay..Vanilla goes with anything!

It was EMPTY during the time I went. Maybe 3-4 other groups. Our waiter was probably only serving us. MAYBE another table. But our water was barely tended to. I had to wait.... wait.... wait again and more and then ask for water... then wait.... wait... and wait some more.  He was just an awkward skinny fella that couldn't crack a smile.  And their AVOCADO appetizers sucks. Barely any avocado. We told the guy that and he said there's not much he can do. Too much waiting.... too little action.

But lo and behold! I have waited until several check-ins to finally leave a review. A girlfriend and I decided to have an impromptu girls dinner night out and we wanted something not expensive but definitely laid back and trendy. This is the spot to be. Service was excellent from the very moment we walked into the door. There were no wait time when we came here (before the dinner rush) and we're seated immediately.  Our server was very prompt and didn't rush us. He and she were very informative as far as recommendations knew their way around the menu. The Food We were light eaters at that moment and had their Lettuce wraps which had mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions tossed in their yummy sauce and of course a good amount of lettuce.You can either order them in chicken or shrimp or both. They are known for their excellent pizza but aside from their eclectic menu, they also have a ""Lite Adventurer"" section. We decided on the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine. I definitely loved the garlic sauce tossed with zucchini, fettuccine, parsley and Parmesan. A friend of mine decided she didn't want to have garlic breath and was able to request hers with light garlic. Our server never failed in remembering details and little customization we requested. I wanted extra garlic on mine! Since then I've been back every so often to try their pizza. I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauce on any of my pizza's, however,  I am a huge fan of their BBQ Chicken which had BBQ sauce, red onions and cilantro and lastly cheese. HEAVEN! Another time I've been here, I had to try their Garlic Cream Fettuccine. I can definitely taste the bite of the roasted garlic on their Parmesan cream sauce. Their menu is so eclectic that they even have gluten free pizzas (for some that like gluten free)... Here's your sign.

I've only been to this particular Waikiki location a few times, every time at a non-peak meal hour.  The service here isn't as spectacular as it is at the Kahala location, but it isn't particularly bad either. I like that you have the option of sitting outside at this location, and that there is a relatively large ""bar area"" with high tables for people who just want a fast bite or to have a drink and watch a game.  My favorites include the BBQ chicken salad, the moroccan chicken salad, thai crunch salad and waldorf chicken salad. I also like the veggie sandwich with caesar salad, kung pao spaghetti and cedar plank salmon. Spinach artichoke dip is a much, not because its the best dip I've ever had, but because it brings back memories of high school days with my friends :) I also like the corn guacamole and chips. It's not that great of a deal for $5, but it's pretty good. Drink wise, the white sangria and mojitos are my faves.

Their food is on par with your typical chain restaurants - pretty tasty, fatty as hell, and not the cheapest but also not crazy $$$$.

268,Sarah K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,2014-08-31,"I like CPK and I'm a regular customer. I usually go to the one in Kahala and I love it there. The servers are awesome and the food's always great. Yesterday, I went to the Waikiki location. I was beyond upset and disappointed. My mom's high school classmates came here to visit and we decided to take them to try CPK. When our food came, the portions of salad and lettuce wraps were noticeably smaller than the ones at Kahala and Ala Moana. I'm, honestly, not the type of person that wants to complain or argue at the restaurant, so it was fine. Until, I noticed that the Chicken Picatta I ordered never arrived. So, of course, I would ask about it. It took several tries to call our waitress, Danielle, over. I understand that CPK is busy, but it probably took almost 10 minutes to call her over. Usually at Kahala, we have to wait almost an hour to get in. We didn't even have to wait for a table at 7:00 PM, so it was not NEARLY as busy as Kahala. When we tried to get the attention of other staff to ask our waitress to come over, they simply ignored us. Finally, when she came over, we told her our order never came, and her reply was ""Oh, it didn't come?"" Then, she said she would check on it. No ""sorry"" or anything. By that time, we were almost done with our meal and I didn't want it anymore, it took another several tries to get her over. In the end, my mom just stood up and walked over to tell her. I just wanted to leave by then. When the bill came, we checked it and GUESS WHAT? The Chicken Picatta was still included on the bill. When I finally got her attention, she nodded her head and probably came back 3 minutes later. Before I could say a word, she snatched the bill, placed a new one down, and said ""Sorry bout that"" (with attitude) and walked away. She obviously knew there was something wrong with the bill because she brought the new one over before I even told her. I was furious. We payed and left. I've always loved CPK for their amazing servers, but I guess not all the servers are amazing. My mom's friends were wearing touristy kind attire and since they're not from here, we didn't speak English. If they're taking advantage of foreign customers, who might not be aware of the bill and wrong charges, that's outrageous. I regret not talking to the manager, because that was one of my worst experiences at a restaurant ever. I am never coming back to the Waikiki CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=260,3.0,3.29,3.29,2.724,3.174

Had lunch at CPK today, sat at a large table and had plenty of room to spread out. For some reason I always order the same thing: Fettuccine Alfredo.  Since I am trying to cut down decided to split the meal and add a dinner salad. The food is consistent and the service was attentive, but a little off.  Had to ask for bread plates because the server brought the bread and we had nothing in front of us for it. Also had to request a fork because only one is set and it was taken with the salad plate. The hostess was cute when she politely asked if it would be ok if she packaged the remaining salad and entree in the kitchen--Yes please!

Are the pre-made?  Not sure what's up.  Returned the dish to our server and I watched him bring it back to the kitchen area and he was talking directly to one of the cooks about the cold frozen Mac N Cheese.  I had wished he had brought this to a manager's attention because no one came to our table to discuss this.      Received our second try of Crispy Mac N Cheese - this time it was hot, but again, I have had better Crispy Mac N Cheese at other CPK's (where the cheese was soft and melted with macaroni that wasn't dry) - quality control anyone? Second, the Spaghetti with Bolognese was bland - had to use a ton of salt, and the pasta was overcooked.  Really overcooked.  Third, my friend's pizza was only luke warm when it got to our table - and actually the crust turned cold after a couple of minutes.  What gives?

FOOD  The complementary four pieces of baguette-type bread and olive oil starts the dining experience. Tonight, we started with the Asparagus & Arugula Salad ($5.99): light dressing and cheese shavings make this a great beginning... The California Club pizza ($14.69) featured a thin but soft crust.  It feels healthy since there's little or no sauce and it's light on bacon and chicken - you really feel more like you're eating arugula, Romaine lettuce and avocado in every slice. The Jambalaya Fettuccine ($18.39) featured lots of big shrimp, bits of ham and crawfish, and Andouille sausage slices. It's great (and not spicy), but it's small for the price. Of note beverage-wise, the Peach Ice Tea ($3.29) is a little weak but at least refillable; I recommend going with the mango iced tea! 3. SERVICE We had Kaylee who was awesome: food came out at a reasonable rate, drinks were refilled without asking and she was always checking in. My fellow Yelpers seemed to have experienced up-and-down service; we've never had an issue on any visit, but your mileage may vary.   4. ATMOSPHERE Like other CPK's out there - it's modern and clean.  The second floor lanei seating overlooking Kalakaua is the one you want (unfortunately you can't make reservations for groups out there).  It's a good place to go any time of day, but the later afternoon and evening (when the tiki torches are lit) are likely your best bets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=40,3.28,3.25,3.25,3.408,3.262

The wait is much shorter compared to other cpk's. The only other hassle is the parking in Waikiki. When a table became available they asked us if outside would be ok. I said sure and the hostess walked us out to a recently cleared table. The table had been cleared but had not been wiped down. I asked the hostess if they could wipe the table down and she called the bus boy over who wiped half of the table but missed where it was still wet and dirty. I told the hostess and she rolled her eyes back at me and was very impatient like as if this was my fault that the chairs and the table still had food from the previous customers. She stormed away while we waited for the bus boy to come back. I could not believe what we were experiencing. She was a local Asian girl and I thought she would be more receptive to locals but maybe she was having a bad night.  I'm in a customer service industry and its important that you don't take your frustrations out on your guests.   Our waitress came over and introduced herself to us. She was very nice. She had red hair and her name was Kaylee. I'm not sure if I am spelling her name correctly. She was so pleasant and professional but most import, very very friendly! Her service was excellent. She brought our food out on a timely basis. She always made sure we were ok and brought back a refill for my daughter when her sprite was low. We had a glass of the Cabernet which was nice. I don't remember the name of it but it was smooth. For our appetizer, we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. For some reason, the Waikiki one tasted way better than the other locations. I'm not sure if they make it different but wow, it was excellent! We also ordered the Mac and cheese, penne pasta, and the Sicilian pizza. Everything was great! Kaylee brought the food out while it was nice and hot and always checked on us yo make sure we were ok or needed anything else.. She made the rest of our experience at CPK very enjoyable!

(6pm-8:30pm)  If you come during this time and/or have a larger party you will likely have to wait. TIP:  If there's only two people in your party, consider eating at the bar.  There usually isn't a wait and watching them make the pizza is a great source of entertainment. Some dishes to try: For the pizza lover - the Original BBQ Chicken For something meatier - the Meat Cravers (Thin Crust Pizza) For something different - the Spaghetti Bolognese For something healthier - the Waldorf Chicken Salad For dessert - the Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake TIP: Don't forget the bread and olive oil!  They should ask you if you want it but if not then let them know.  The bread is served warm and the olive oil has herbs and spices in it.  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=60,3.48,3.21,3.21,3.4120000000000004,3.318
256,John N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,1.0,3.0,2015-05-21,Let me start by saying the food is AMAZING! Plus the prices are very realistic. Very good service very little wait time even though we didn't book and overall the experience is great.  Let me just say one thing about the waiters and as far as tipping goes. For some reason waiters from all around Waikiki expect that you tip them 20% of the bill all the time everytime. This as you can imagine is very hard to do if your eating out day in day out especially with a large family. Needless to say we left a tip of $5 cash as we were paying by card and had no other cash to offer and the waiter was very attentive and friendly up until that point. Once she put the credit card through she basically threw the bill back to us without even saying thank you or goodbye. I found that very rude as she was more than friendly two mins prior to this. Employees seem to forget that we also work for our money so it's not always easy to throw 20% of the bill around on tips 3 times a day for two weeks. Please rectify this issue with employees cpk as if it wasn't for that one rude gesture this review would of been 5 stars As the food is simply amazing!   That won't stop me from going back though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=160,3.52,3.2,3.2,3.1160000000000005,3.3280000000000007

Gone are the days of the bread that was stale on the outside and butter that ripped the bread to shreads.  Now they have a sort of artisan bread; crisp and paired with olive oil and seasoning. Great starter without ordering.  This time I had the Vegetarian Sandwich (foccaccio bread with portebello, vegetables with sun dried tomato aioli).  A great meal for two or for a snack later.   The atmosphere is nice and has a darker or dimly lit feel. I think it's wonderful for business meetings or to simply hang out with friends. Gets completely away from the sand and sun right outside for Waikiki beach but it's good to take a break from the sun too.  There is outdoor seating as well if you want the sun and people to watch (one of my favorite past times).   Wait service normally great but I believe they were unsure with us conducting business. As my business associate mentioned they are normally great; so chalk it up as a random occurrence. Parking is an issue in the area but if you're already here then it's all good. Note, you have an escalator going up and steps going down only. There is an elevator not top far from the steps.

On to the positives.  The female hostess was smiley and friendly.  Our server Dennis was friendly, professional, and a part time comedian.  He informed me of new changes and additions to the menu starting in December 2015.   I won't go into details on our food because we always order the same thing.  The lettuce wraps, and my ultimate favorite Jambalaya Pasta were awesome as usual.  Oh but wait, we did try a new pasta dish.

It was very crowded and we were told 45 minutes but we decided to stick it out because we were in the mood for pizza and we'd been to other branches of this chain and like their food. At the 45 minute mark I asked how much longer it would be and was told another 15 minutes. It took 25 and we were finally seated. We already knew what we wanted so we gave the waitress our order. Then we overheard another waitress tell another table that pizza orders were backed up for an hour. When ours came back with our drinks we asked her and she said she'd already placed the order and it shouldn't be that long. Well, it took an hour and 15 minutes until our pizza finally showed up. Over an hour for pizza! In a pizza restaurant! It was pretty good but small and not worth the wait. In the meantime we were offered chips and salsa--who wants chips and salsa as an appetizer before pizza? To make it worse there was a table with five drunk Australians next to us who were getting louder and louder and annoying everyone else in the section. Another restaurant would have had a manager tell them to chill or leave but they were allowed to keep being disruptive. We want to make it clear that none of this was our server's fault. She was very apologetic. We gave her a good tip. But this place clearly can't handle a full house. Either hire more cooks, get another oven or don't run such a huge restaurant. All told we spent two and a half hours here for an average pizza and noisy neighbors.

29,Jen C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,4.0,2017-04-29,"I recently held my son's 6th birthday party here with 13 kids and 15 adults. Overall it was great. Our contact, Katrina, was very responsive to email beforehand and very attentive and flexible on the day-of.  The kids made pizza, got a tour of the restaurant, then ate the pizzas and had cake (which we brought). The whole party lasted about 2 hours, even though it was scheduled for 1.5 hrs (9:30-11am). In retrospect, a cake was not necessary because CPK provides sundaes as part of the kid's meal. The cost is $10/kid. I appreciated that Katrina was attentive to cleanliness, asking the kids to wash hands before the pizza making. For the adults, we ordered 3 spinach artichoke dips, 2 salads, and 5 pizzas. That was just about right... not too heavy since it wasn't quite lunch time yet. I took off one star for a couple reasons. First, parking in Waikiki was a big concern of mine. I researched beforehand and in the end, here are the best options I found: 1) Waikiki parking garage on Seaside Ave, first driveway on the right, $7 flat rate 2) Elite parking garage on Seaside Ave, second driveway on the right, next to Ross, first 2 hrs free with validation (any Ross purchase) and $3/half hour after that.  Both garages are just around the corner from CPK (5 min walk). Second reason for four stars is that I felt 1.5 hours was a little tight. Thankfully, Katrina did not rush us at all, but I felt bad for staying beyond the scheduled end time. If your guests are not punctual...as most local people aren't (myself included!), it's very hard to stick to the 1.5 hr time frame. Our entire party didn't arrive until nearly 10am, and we were out around 11:30. Tips: we saved a little by buying gift cards at Sams Club. Also, if you prefer Ala Moana or Kahala locations, book a couple months in advance. I didn't and that's how we ended up in Waikiki...but it all worked out and I'm thankful that they were able to accommodate us with less than a month's notice. Our guests seemed to enjoy themselves and those who had never done this before thought it was a great experience, so we'd highly recommend it!! Again, props to Katrina and her staff--they were wonderful! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-3?start=20,3.8,3.46,3.388,2.576,3.596

74,Michelle A.,"Honolulu, HI",47,4,2.0,1.0,2017-05-12,"They gave us bad service just because they thought we were Japanese tourists!!! While the food was good, the service definitely was not. I recently went here with a couple of friends (from Japan) who have been studying abroad here for a year (they have very advanced English abilities). When we entered the restaurant, we were immediately asked if we wanted a menu in another language. (I am JAPANESE-AMERICAN and they automatically assumed I was foreign) We politely refused but the waitress but she asked again more insistently saying that the ""menu was complicated and might be hard for [us] to understand."" We refused again. She finally took us to our seats. We noticed that the table was dirty and when we asked for it to be cleaned the waitress sighed and mumbled ""it's just pepper, honey, calm down."" We ordered our food and waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come. During this time, people had been sitting next to us but they were given the option to sit elsewhere and, thus, we were sitting in a secluded area with little service. Only later did we notice that we did not get any bread. (By this time we had already gotten our food and decided we didn't need it) We were still eating when the waitress came around and asked if we were finished. We told them we were still working on it. She came back a few minutes later and asked if we were finished with our meals again, as if she did not notice that we were still eating off our plates. Again, we told her we were still eating. The waitress returned a few minutes with the check and tried to take away our dishes. This was already the third time that she tried to take away our dishes when we were still eating! When I opened up the check, I noticed the words ""MAHALO"" written in red marker, the tip calculations were circled with huge smiley faces around it. I knew that they thought we were tourists, but I couldn't help but feel offended. We had come in for an early dinner (so there was not that many people there)....but why were they giving us so much attitude? Why were they trying to make us leave asap?! The only reason why I could think of was because they thought we were Japanese tourists...the people around us were not treated in this way!

The soup was excellent, I beloved it was the harvest selection, flavor was strong and a bowl size is a great portion paired with a small sized salad.

The restaurant serves complimentary bread with seasoned olive oil while you wait on food. The bread was really fresh - crisp crust and nice squishy middle. Here is where my disappointment came from: I ordered the avocado egg rolls for appetizer. They looked really pretty sitting on the plate when they got there with their dual dippikng sauces. I first noticed how greasy they were when I picked up the first piece and oil dripped down my fingers. I just wiped my hand and proceeded to bite my first piece.

The California club pizza they gave to us without the toppings, as they intended to keep the cold toppings separate to the hot pizza, and just forgot to give them to us. I called the restaurant when we got back to the hotel and realised and the manager was really nice and offered us a new pizza which we came back to pick up. When we got to the restaurant we got our order but the toppings were ridiculous: 3 slices of tomato and 3 slices of avocado for a whole pizza!! The website menu shows one slice of tomato and slice of avo for each slice of pizza so there should have been 6. When I questioned the guy about this he remarked to another worker, 'what's up with these guys' right in front of us. The second guy (who was the guy who packed our initial order) asked what we wanted and I told him he forgot half our pizza and he just replied with 'yeah the cold toppings are just here on the bench.' He didn't apologise or even acknowledge the fact that he was the one who messed up. In the end we did get more of the avo and tomato but not without an argument. Both men were so blatantly rude and disrespectful.

2,Shireen E.,"Waianae, HI",167,13,,2.0,2017-10-25,"I hate writing a review with such little stars because both our food and server were excellent.  However, the minus stars are for 2 things: 1. After we've  already ordered and finished our appetizer a manager approaches my boyfriend and tells him that the ahi isn't fresh and he wouldn't feel right serving it to him so my bf changes his order to the ribeye. Not even 2 minutes after he leaves our table my food (a salad and a pizza) arrives. When the waitress brings my food she tells us that no one even told her they were out of ahi. When she saw my food she asked where the ahi was and that's when she found out. Really? Shouldn't the kitchen inform the waitress right away? WTH? So I'm sitting there feeling bad because I have my food and my bf is watching me eat. Even the sorry from the manager was non-chalant. All of this and no discount or even a comp dessert.  2. The table we were at was right in the middle area of the restaurant near the server's station. All night we listened to the servers and managers talk about bills and talking about their customers and tips. They even knew we could hear because they would look at me and smile or turn away quickly.
