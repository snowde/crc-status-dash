11,Kevin B.,"Dakota, MN",18,34,,5.0,2012-03-13,"Great value for an airport restaurant. On a layover, had prime rib and chicken with three fantastic sides. $11.99--how could you not like this?

Frozen pizza? what.. and OVERPRICED for the size it was like $13 for a since person size, I even asked they said oh its plenty for two.. now come on .. its four MINI slices.. if your hungry after being at an airport for hours.. its a good snack size. but lower the price..   i was disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
2,Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9798,55713.0,4.0,2013-11-15,"The problem with running out the door to get to your flight, go through security, check in and all that shit is you dont have time to eat. So right before getting on a five our flight back home I had to weigh my options. Ahh CPK. First thing the person does is hand me a menu but it's all in Japanese. Oops they hand me the correct one right after. So crazy the level of Japanese based tourism here. Just got a simple pepperoni after having many days of Hawaiian specific meals, which were great, but I needed to change it up. For 15 minutes till boarding and starving, this place will do!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

5,Kelly T.,"Honolulu, HI",23,101,10.0,3.0,2014-05-18,Best quick/ semi-healthy meal at the airport. On the international side of the airport but worth the trek because it's in the same area as Pinkberry!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
4,Andrew P.,"Bellevue, WA",1,5,1.0,1.0,2015-02-11,"Worst pizza in a long time, tastes like frozen pizza from the supermarket. For similar prices PGA Tour restaurant nearby has much better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,,,,,
32,Vacation W.,"Weare, NH",0,10,3.0,1.0,2015-03-13,"First of all I generally like California Pizza Kitchen.  BUT, this location, not being able to utilize a brick oven, produces a very bland tasting pizza.  The pizza race track oven is like Dominos's, but even Domino's has more flavor. I ordered a margarita pizza and was very disappointed, especially the price for this, $13.99.   The crust definitely doesn't cut it.  Unfortunately if this were the first time I ever tried CPK, I wouldn't go back. Just an FYI CPK. This doesn't do your usual product justice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
3,Michelle B.,"San Diego, CA",50,171,742.0,2.0,2015-04-10,I guess it's because it's located at the airport you can't expect great quality. I was disappointed with the taste and I'm shocked you have to ask for plates when you requested to eat there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,,,,,
0,Michelle I.,"Burlingame, CA",4,12,58.0,4.0,2015-08-14,Thought it was real good pizza especially considering it was at an airport. Pricy though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20,,,,,
30,Gregg T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",125,79,31.0,3.0,2015-09-27,Caesar salad had wilty lettuce. I'd steer clear of grabbing a salad unless you thoroughly check the freshness of the leaves (which can be hard to do based on how they package it). The pizza was decently good. I got the Margarita pizza and it was better than I'd expect from food court pizza. So in short try the pizza and stay away from the salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
22,Maria G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",357,508,1835.0,1.0,2016-01-29,"I like California Pizza Kitchen, I really do. So, when I saw CPK as a food option at this airport I was happy.  We always get the same pizza for CPK no matter what location we visit, the pepperoni  & sausage with half mushrooms. Hubby eats the meat side and I eat the mushroom side but when we got the pizza they forgot the mushroom, now I'm sad. But when hubby picked up the pizza grease just dripped like a leaky faucet, now he's sad. Never had this pizza greasy like this. Needless to say, we did not eat the pizza at all. We was getting ready to take a 10 hour flight and who knows what this greasy pizza would have done to our stomach way up in the air!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
1,Jason W.,"Suwanee, GA",66,104,62.0,2.0,2016-05-07,Could definitely use some help. Had their breakfast sandwich and their bread was definitely not fresh. Was chewy as if it had been a few days old.

31,Barbara P.,"San Jose, CA",82,114,80.0,1.0,2016-09-28,You would think for $14 for a pizza they would be nice this gentlemen infront of me was paying in change and she grabbed it and put it to the side in a plate and not in the register ! Also We are airport employees and work for airlines we asked if we ca. Use out discount and she only let us use it once because she said we can only use it once even tho we had 3 transactions we all individually work for the airline she got off the register and stop helping customers to make sure we don't use out %10 again !

17,Kathryn M.,"Chesapeake, VA",373,487,1934.0,4.0,2017-01-22,I wanted pizza and this was the only place pizza was sold inside the Honolulu airport. I have never ordered a pizza at CPK before ( I always order seafood or pasta). They had about 8 specialty pizzas starting at $13 to about $15. I thought this was a bit expensive but I got it anyway. My sausage mushroom pizza was on point! The only thing that kept this place from receiving 5 stars was the fact that they didn't offer pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
21,Yvette A.,"Encinitas, CA",76,172,61.0,3.0,2017-03-22,I know it's airport food so you should t expect too much but this was bad.

Stay away from the pizza...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
28,T M.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",1,63,51.0,2.0,2017-03-29,Only thing good about it was that it was quick. I paid over $30 for some soggy over cheesed pizza. Super bummer. Sticking with Starbucks next time I'm here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,

16,Remi M.,"Honolulu, HI",27,216,745.0,3.0,2017-05-15,"This airport CPK does not accept CPK gift cards since it's contracted out to HMS Host. They do take other forms of major credit cards though. I wanted something light for pre-flight so I got the Caesar Salad. The food court area is very small with limited seating. Had to walk around the terminal a bit until an open table was found. Next time I may just mosey to the food court with the ""other Burger King"" [Did you know this airport has 2 Burger Kings?] since I noticed a lot of empty tables over there. It would be cool if this CPK offered some type of pasta dish. The Pizza Hut Express inside Target offers pasta so not sure why it would be difficult to do it here. Oh well. I can dream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4,,,,,
